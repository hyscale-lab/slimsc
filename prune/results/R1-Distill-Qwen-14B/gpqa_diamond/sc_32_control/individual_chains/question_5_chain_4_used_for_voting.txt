Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about finding the eigenvector of an operator along an arbitrary direction. Let me see. The operator is P, and the direction is n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. I need to find the normalized eigenvector's elements from the given options.

Wait, the problem gives me the components of the operator P in terms of X, Y, and Z. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, I think I'll need to construct the operator P along the direction n first.

Since n is in the x-z plane, the direction can be represented by angles θ and φ, but since it's in x-z, maybe φ is zero? Or does it matter? Wait, no, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so the angle φ is zero or maybe it's arbitrary as long as it's in x-z. Hmm.

The general form of a vector operator like P (which is a spin operator, I think) in an arbitrary direction is given by the dot product of the operator components with the direction vector. So, P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. 

Wait, but n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1. So, n_x could be cosθ and n_z sinθ, perhaps? Or wait, the standard spherical coordinates have polar angle θ from the z-axis. So, n_x would be sinθ cosφ, but since n is in x-z plane, φ is zero. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Oh, wait, no. Because for direction in x-z plane, the polar angle θ would be measured from the z-axis. So, the x-component would be sinθ and the z-component cosθ, but only if φ is zero. Alternatively, maybe n_x is cosθ and n_z is sinθ? I think I need to be careful here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to parameterize n as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ) if θ is the angle from the z-axis. Because in that case, when θ=0, n is along z, and θ=90 would be along x. So, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. So that makes sense. So, P = sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z.

So, substituting the given P_x, P_y, and P_z matrices. Let's write them out:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, substituting into P:

P = sinθ * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute that matrix. Let's factor out (ħ/2):

P = (ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Wait, let's do the matrix multiplication. The first term is sinθ times [[0,1],[1,0]] → [[0, sinθ],[sinθ, 0]]. The second term is cosθ times [[1,0],[0,-1]] → [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]. Adding these together:

Top left: cosθ + 0 = cosθ. Top right: sinθ + 0 = sinθ. Bottom left: sinθ + 0 = sinθ. Bottom right: 0 + (-cosθ) = -cosθ.

So the matrix becomes [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] multiplied by (ħ/2).

So now, the operator P is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. Now, to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>.

So, substituting P:

(ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] * |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

We can divide both sides by ħ/2 to get:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] * |ψ> = |ψ>.

So, the matrix equation is:

[cosθ * a + sinθ * b,
 sinθ * a - cosθ * b] = [a, b]

So, equating each component:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a → (cosθ - 1)a + sinθ b = 0 → equation (1)
sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b → sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b = 0 → equation (2)

Now, we can solve these equations. Let's see.

From equation (1): (cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b.

Let me simplify the denominator: cosθ -1 = -(1 - cosθ) → so a = [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ] b.

Alternatively, 1 - cosθ is 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ is 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So, sinθ/(1 - cosθ) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [2 sin²(theta/2)] ] = cot(theta/2).

So a = cot(theta/2) * b.

So, a = b * cot(theta/2).

Wait, but cot(theta/2) is cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2). So, perhaps we can parameterize the eigenvector in terms of theta.

Let me set b = 1 for simplicity, then a = cot(theta/2).

So, |ψ> would be [ a, b ] = [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

But wait, this needs to be normalized. So, compute the norm:

|a|² + |b|² = [ cot²(theta/2) + 1 ] = csc²(theta/2) → since 1 + cot²(x) = csc²(x).

So, the normalization factor is 1 / sqrt(csc²(theta/2)) ) = sin(theta/2).

So, the normalized eigenvector is [ cot(theta/2) sin(theta/2), 1 * sin(theta/2) ].

Simplify:

cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2). So, a sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2).

So the first component is cos(theta/2), the second is sin(theta/2).

Wait, but wait: No. Because the eigenvector we have is [a, b] = [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]

When normalized, it's [ a sin(theta/2), b sin(theta/2) ].

Wait no, the normalization is [a, b] multiplied by sin(theta/2), because 1/sqrt( (a)^2 + (b)^2 ) = sin(theta/2) as I found earlier.

So, the normalized vector is [ a sin(theta/2), b sin(theta/2) ].

Substituting a and b:

a = cot(theta/2) → a sin(theta/2) = cot(theta/2) sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2).

b = 1 → b sin(theta/2) = sin(theta/2).

So, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D is sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2/2). Wait, no, option D is sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2). Hmm.

Wait, but in our calculation, the eigenvector seems to be [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). But wait, the problem says the eigenvector is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, so the angle θ would relate to the direction. So, the eigenvector components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2) as per our calculation.

Wait, but let me double-check the setup. Because sometimes in spin systems, the eigenstates might have a different parametrization.

Wait, another approach: the eigenvalue equation is [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] times [a; b] equals [a; b].

So, the equations are:

cosθ a + sinθ b = a → (cosθ -1)a + sinθ b =0

sinθ a - cosθ b = b → sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b =0

From the first equation: (cosθ -1)a = -sinθ b → a = [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ] b.

Which is the same as a = [ (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / (2 sin²(theta/2)) ) ] b → simplifies to cot(theta/2) b.

So, if I set b=1, then a = cot(theta/2).

Then, the vector is [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

But the normalization is sqrt( |a|² + |b|² ) = sqrt( cot²(theta/2) + 1 ) = sqrt( csc²(theta/2) ) = 1/sin(theta/2).

So, the normalized vector is [ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), 1 * sin(theta/2) ) ] → [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So, yes, option C.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but what about the normalization? Because in the problem statement, each component is given as multiplied by ħ/2, but the eigenvector is just a vector, so the components shouldn't have ħ factors because eigenvectors are dimensionless (they're states, not operators).

Wait, the question gives the components of the operator P_x, P_y, P_z as involving ħ/2. But the eigenvector is a unit vector, so the entries shouldn't have ħ. So, in our calculation, the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Looking at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Option D: sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)

Wait, but option C's components are dimensionless, which makes sense for a state vector. So, why is option D including ħ? That doesn't make sense. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, the operator's components have ħ, but the eigenvector is a vector, so it's just a mathematical vector without units. So, the answer should be option C.

But wait, why is the option D including ħ? Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the spin state, and the eigenvector is expressed in terms of some other parameters. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the operator is P, which is a spin operator. The eigenvalue is ħ/2, so the eigenvector should be along the direction n. So, the spin-up state along n would have components ( cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ), but since n is in the x-z plane, phi is zero, so it's ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which matches option C. So, option C is correct.

But wait, looking at the problem statement again, the options are a bit confusing. Let me read them again.

Option A: sqrt(2/3) hbar, sqrt(1/3) hbar.

Hmm, but that would have dimensions of ħ, which doesn't make sense for a state vector. So probably not.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

Wait, but theta is the polar angle, and for spin states, the parametrization is usually in terms of theta/2. So, I think this is for the spherical harmonics, but not the spin-1/2 eigenstates. So this might not be correct.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Yes, that's what we derived.

Option D: sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2).

Again, this has ħ, which I don't think is correct for the eigenvector.

Wait, but maybe I'm miscalculating the eigenvalues. Let me re-examine the equations.

Wait, the matrix after substituting for P is (ħ/2) times [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]. So, when setting this equal to (ħ/2) times the identity matrix (because the eigenvalue is ħ/2), we get the matrix equation as [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] times [a; b] = [a; b].

So, the equations are:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b =0

So, solving these, we can express a in terms of b: a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b.

But 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So,

a = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] / ( 2 sin²(theta/2) ) ) * b = [ cos(theta/2)/ sin(theta/2) ) ] * b = cot(theta/2) b.

So, the eigenvector is (cot(theta/2), 1) times some normalization factor.

But wait, let's compute the norm squared: |a|^2 + |b|^2 = cot²(theta/2) + 1 = ( cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) ) / sin²(theta/2) ) → (1)/(sin²(theta/2)).

So, the norm is 1/(sin(theta/2)), so the normalized vector is [ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), 1 * sin(theta/2) ) ] → [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking back at the options, option C is exactly this. So, the correct answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is constructed using the given components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, and the direction $\vec{n}$ is parameterized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ since it lies in the x-z plane.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P}$
The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed as:
\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]
Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, and using the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix},
\]
we compute:
\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right).
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\vec{P} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Substituting $\vec{P}$:
\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]
This gives the system of equations:
\[
\cos\theta \, a + \sin\theta \, b = a, \quad \sin\theta \, a - \cos\theta \, b = b.
\]
From the first equation:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta \, b = 0 \implies a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b.
\]
Using the trigonometric identities $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, we simplify:
\[
a = \cot(\theta/2) \, b.
\]

### Step 3: Normalize the eigenvector
The eigenvector is proportional to:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The normalization condition is:
\[
|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1 \implies \cot^2(\theta/2) + 1 = 1.
\]
Using $\cot^2(\theta/2) + 1 = \csc^2(\theta/2)$, the normalization factor is $1/\sin(\theta/2)$. Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect for a normalized eigenvector.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ is inconsistent with the spin-1/2 eigenstate parametrization.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.
