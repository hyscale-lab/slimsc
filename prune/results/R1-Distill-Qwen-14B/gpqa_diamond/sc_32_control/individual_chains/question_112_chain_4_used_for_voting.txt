Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again.

The state is |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. We're dealing with the z-projection of spin, so up and down are the eigenstates of S_z. Then, we have an operator whose matrix elements Aij are hbar/2 when i≠j and zero otherwise. The question is to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of this operator and the average value of the operator.

Hmm. So, first things first. Let's think about the state |alpha>. Since it's proportional to that expression, we'll need to normalize it. The coefficients are complex, so when we calculate the inner product, we'll have to take their moduli squared.

The state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let me compute the normalization factor. The inner product of |alpha> with itself is (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i), so their conjugates are (1-i) and (2+i), respectively.

So the norm is |(1+i)|^2 + |(2-i)|^2. Let's calculate each modulus squared.

|1+i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 = 2.

Wait, no, wait, more accurately: (1+i) multiplied by conjugate (1-i) is (1)(1) + (1)(-i) + (i)(1) + (i)(-i) = 1 -i +i -i². i squared is -1, so 1 -i +i +1 = 2. So yes, 2.

For the second term, (2 - i) times (2 + i) is 2^2 + (1)^2 = 4 +1=5. Wait, wait: (2 - i)(2 + i) = 4 + 2i - 2i -i². i² is -1, so 4 +0i +1=5. So the modulus squared is 5.

So the norm is 2 +5 =7. So |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> divided by sqrt(7). So the normalized state is 1/sqrt(7) times that.

So the state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Next, I need to find the eigenstates of the operator A. The matrix A has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, 0 otherwise. Wait, what are the indices here? Since we're dealing with spin-1/2 systems (electron spin), the states are |up> and |down>, so the matrix is 2x2.

So for a 2x2 matrix, the elements are:
A_11=0, A_12= hbar/2,
A_21= hbar/2, A_22=0.

So the matrix is:
[ 0        hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2   0     ]

Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix.

What are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix? Let's compute them.

The eigenvalues λ satisfy the equation det(A - λ I) =0.

So the determinant is (0 - λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)^2 = λ^2 - (hbar^2)/4 =0.

So λ^2 = (hbar^2)/4 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2. So the eigenstates correspond to these two values.

But wait, what's the operator A? It looks like a spin operator in a different direction. Wait, the standard Pauli matrices have similar structures. Let me think: the Pauli matrices σx and σy have similar forms. Oh wait, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if A were proportional to σx, then A would have elements with ± hbar/2 where off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So our A is (hbar/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]] which is (hbar/2) σx.

Ah, so the eigenvalues are ± (hbar/2), and the eigenvectors are the eigenstates of σx, which are (1,1)/sqrt(2) and (1,-1)/sqrt(2) in the σx basis, which are |+x> and |-x> states.

Wait, so the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x> with eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2, respectively.

So, the operator A is (hbar/2) σx, and thus its eigenstates are the eigenstates of σx.

So to find the probabilities, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A (i.e., the |+x> and |-x> states), and then the probabilities are the square of their coefficients.

Alternatively, since the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, we can write |alpha> as a linear combination of these and find the coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value without diagonalizing A, but since the question also asks for the average value, perhaps we can compute that directly.

Wait, but the question is about measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A. So the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, which are hbar/2 and -hbar/2, and the probabilities are the probabilities of the state collapsing into each eigenstate.

So the steps are:

1. Find the eigenstates of A (which are |+x> and |-x>).
2. Express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.
3. The coefficients' moduli squared give the probabilities.
4. The average value is the expectation value of A, which can be found as <alpha| A |alpha>, or using the eigenvalues and probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is Hermitian (real and symmetric in this case), the expectation value would be the weighted average of the eigenvalues, with weights the probabilities.

So let's proceed.

First, find the eigenstates of A. Since A = (hbar/2) σx, and σx has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, we can write:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, let's check that. The σx eigenstates are:

σx |+x> = |+x> → which for σx, the eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Because σx flips the spin in the x-direction, so its eigenstates are superpositions.

So |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalue +1 for σx. Then, A is (hbar/2) σx, so the eigenvalue for |+x> is (hbar/2)(+1) = hbar/2.

Similarly, |-x> has eigenvalue -hbar/2.

So now, express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>.

|alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |-x>

We can find c1 and c2 by expressing |alpha> in terms of these states.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and |-x> to get the coefficients.

So:

c1 = < +x | alpha >

c2 = < -x | alpha >

Then, the probability of measuring hbar/2 is |c1|^2, and for -hbar/2 is |c2|^2.

Wait, let's compute c1.

|+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

So < +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ < up | + < down | ] * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ]

So that's (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2-i) <up|down> + (1+i) <down|up> + (2-i) <down|down> ]

The inner products <up|up> = 1, <up|down>=0, <down|up>=0, <down|down>=1.

So this simplifies to (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) *1 + (2 -i)*1 ]

So (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3 +0i =3.

So c1 = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, c2 is < -x | alpha >.

|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So < -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ < up | - < down | ] * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ]

Which becomes (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) <up|up> - (1-i) <down|down> ]

Because (2-i) comes with a negative from <down|, and when we take the inner product, it's (2-i)* (-1) since the coefficient is (2-i) multiplied by <down | which is -<down|, so (2-i) multiplied by -1.

Wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> divided by sqrt(7). So when I take < -x | alpha >, it's (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] multiplied by (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ].

So expanding:

(1/(sqrt(14))) [ <up| (1+i)|up> + <up| (2-i)|down> - <down| (1+i)|up> - <down| (2-i)|down> ]

Again, since <up|down> and <down|up> are zero, this simplifies to:

(1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) <up|up> - (2 -i) <down|down> ]

Which is (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]

Compute (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1 -2) + (i +i) = (-1) + (2i) = -1 + 2i.

So c2 = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

So now, the probabilities are |c1|^2 and |c2|^2.

Compute |c1|²: (3/sqrt(14))² = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857...

Compute |c2|²: [ (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14) ] squared modulus. So modulus is sqrt( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4) = sqrt(5). So |c2|² is (5)/14 ≈ 0.35714...

Wait, but wait, let me double-check that calculation.

Wait, (-1 + 2i) is a complex number. Its magnitude squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5. So |c2|^2 = 5/14 ≈0.357.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.643 and 5/14≈0.357.

Wait a second, that's about 0.64 and 0.36. Looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36. But let's check the options.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

But wait, let's go back to the average value. The expectation value of A is < alpha | A | alpha >.

Alternatively, since A has eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2, with respective probabilities p1 and p2, the expectation value is p1*(hbar/2) + p2*(-hbar/2) = (p1 - p2)*(hbar/2).

But since p1 + p2 =1, p2=1-p1. So:

Expectation value = (p1 - (1-p1)) * (hbar/2) = (2 p1 -1) (hbar/2) )

Given that p1 is 9/14, so 2*(9/14) -1 = (18/14 -14/14) )=4/14=2/7.

So expectation value is (2/7) * (hbar/2) )= (hbar/7).

So the average is hbar/7. Which matches option A's third value.

But wait, wait a second. Let me double-check the expectation value calculation.

Alternatively, compute <A> = <alpha | A | alpha >.

We can compute this using the matrix representation. Let's build the matrix A and the state vector.

The state |alpha> in the z basis is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The matrix A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

So matrix multiplication: A |alpha> = [ (0 * a + (hbar/2)*b ), ( (hbar/2)*a + 0*b ) ]^T, where a is (1+i)/sqrt(7), b is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So A|alpha> = [ (hbar/2) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (hbar/2) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then, the inner product < alpha | A | alpha > is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] multiplied by A|alpha>.

So:

= [ (1-i) * (hbar/2 (2 -i) ) + (2 +i) * (hbar/2 (1 + i) ) ] /7.

Factor out hbar/2:

= (hbar/(2*7)) [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ]

Compute each term:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i².

i² is -1, so 2 -3i -1=1 -3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i = 2 +2i +i +i².

Which is 2 +3i -1=1 +3i.

So adding both terms: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) =2.

So the expectation value is (hbar/(14)) * 2 = hbar/7.

That matches the earlier calculation. So the expectation is hbar/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.64286 (which is ~0.64) and 5/14≈0.357 (≈0.36). So the options looking for 0.64 and 0.36 are option A.

But wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7.

So that would be correct for the probabilities and the expectation.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D has 0.61 and 0.29, which sum to 0.9, but that can't be. So assuming that option A is correct.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating c2. Let me recheck.

Wait, when I calculated c2, I got (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14). So the modulus squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) =1 +4=5. So 5/14≈0.357, which is about 0.36. So 9/14 is about 0.6428, which is 0.64.

So the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7. So option A is the answer.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A's average is hbar/7. So that's correct.

But wait, let me think again. The operator A is (hbar/2) σx. The expectation value of σx for |alpha> is (expectation of A) multiplied by 2/hbar.

So perhaps another approach is to compute the expectation value of σx.

But perhaps it's not necessary, since the earlier methods have given me the correct expectation value.

So the conclusion is option A: probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, average hbar/7.

The problem involves an electron spin state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator A, whose matrix representation is given by Aij = ℏ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of A must be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The given state is |α⟩ = (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. To normalize it, compute the norm:
\[
\| |α⟩ \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + 1^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩ \right).
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator A
The operator A has a matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \). The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are:
\[
|+x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |up⟩ + |down⟩ \right), \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |up⟩ - |down⟩ \right),
\]
with eigenvalues \( +\frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively. Thus, the eigenstates of A are \( |+x⟩ \) and \( |-x⟩ \).

### Step 3: Express |α⟩ in terms of |+x⟩ and |-x⟩
To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of A, express |α⟩ as a linear combination of \( |+x⟩ \) and \( |-x⟩ \):
\[
|α⟩ = c_1 |+x⟩ + c_2 |-x⟩,
\]
where the coefficients \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are:
\[
c_1 = ⟨+x|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
c_2 = ⟨-x|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute probabilities
The probabilities of measuring \( |+x⟩ \) and \( |-x⟩ \) are the squared moduli of \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \), respectively:
\[
P(+x) = |c_1|^2 = \left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64,
\]
\[
P(-x) = |c_2|^2 = \left( \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 5: Compute the average value of A
The average value of A is the expectation value \( ⟨α|A|α⟩ \). Using the eigenvalues and probabilities:
\[
⟨A⟩ = P(+x) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-x) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} - \frac{5}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring \( |+x⟩ \) and \( |-x⟩ \) are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, respectively, and the average value of A is \( \hbar/7 \). This matches **Option A**.
