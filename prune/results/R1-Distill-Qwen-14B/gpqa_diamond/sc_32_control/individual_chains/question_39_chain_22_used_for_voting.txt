Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the setup is that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube—so that's the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Wait, I think I should write that down. The wave function ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measure the position, none of the particles are found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. That means the wave function must be zero outside this interval, right?

Wait, but the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) - 0.5i. Hmm. I'm a bit confused here. Wait, maybe I should think about the probability density. The square of the absolute value of the wave function gives the probability density. So |ψ(x)|² is the probability per unit length of finding the particle at position x.

Since when measuring, all particles are found between x=1 and x=3, the wave function must be zero outside that region. So for x <1 and x>3, ψ(x) must be zero. But wait, the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but that can't be zero unless both terms are zero. Wait, but the first term is a real variable (a is real?), and the second term is imaginary. So, the sum can only be zero if both terms are zero. That would require a/(sqrt(1+x)) = 0 and -0.5i =0, which is impossible because a can't be zero if we have a wave function. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the wave function. Maybe the given wave function is the one only in the region where the particles are found. So, in the region x between 1 and 3, ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) - 0.5i. But outside this region, it's zero. But wait, the question states that when they measure, none are found outside x=1 and x=3, meaning that the wave function must have zero probability outside that interval. So, the wave function must be zero when x<1 or x>3. Therefore, the given expression applies only between x=1 and x=3, and is zero elsewhere.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) - 0.5i. So, perhaps this is valid only in the region where x is between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function is:

ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤3,
and ψ(x)=0 otherwise.

Wait, but that would make the wave function discontinuous at x=1 and x=3, which isn't typical for wave functions. They usually are continuous. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is given as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 +x)) - 0.5i, and this is valid in the region where the particle exists. But the particle can't exist outside x=1 and x=3, so perhaps this wave function is only non-zero between those points. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but the problem says that when measuring, none were found at x <1 or x>3. So, the wave function must be zero in those regions. So the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3, and non-zero in between.

Wait, but then the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) -0.5i. So perhaps the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the wave function is a combination of a real term and an imaginary term. That seems odd because for a stationary state, the wave function is usually real (up to a global phase), but perhaps this is a different scenario.

Alternatively, maybe the wave function is given as ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1 +x)) - (0.5)i, which is a complex function. So, the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. But then, the probability density would be |ψ(x)|² = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. That's because when you square the absolute value of a complex number, you have (Re)^2 + (Im)^2.

Wait, but wait, that's only the case if the real and imaginary parts are orthogonal. So, |ψ|² = (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. But since the wave function must be normalized, the integral of this from x=1 to x=3 must be 1. Because all the probability is within that region.

So, the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

So the integral is ∫ (a²/(1 + x) + 0.25) dx from 1 to 3.

Let me compute that.

The integral of a²/(1+x) from 1 to 3 is a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to3. So that's a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

The integral of 0.25 from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Let me compute that. ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849. Hmm. So looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the steps again.

The wave function is ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i.

The probability density is |ψ|^2 = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2.

The normalization condition is the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx =1.

So the integral is a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1→3 + ∫0.25 dx from 1→3.

∫1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x), so from 1 to3, it's ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2).

And ∫0.25 dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(2) =0.5.

So the equation is a² * ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a² * ln(2) =0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2). Let me compute that precisely.

ln(2) is approximately 0.69314718056.

So 0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.7213475.

Taking the square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7213475) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. So option B.

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So perhaps I should check if the wave function is square-integrable and normalized, but I think I did that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration. Let me recheck.

Wait, the integral of a²/(1+x) from 1 to 3 is a² [ln(1+x)] from 1 to3 → a² (ln4 - ln2) = a² ln2. Correct.

The integral of 0.25 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5. So that's correct.

So the equation a² ln2 + 0.5 =1 → a² = (1-0.5)/ln2 = 0.5/(0.6931) ≈0.7213 → a≈0.849, so option B is 0.85. So that would be the correct answer.

Therefore, the answer should be B) 0.85.

To solve the problem, we analyze the wave function and normalization condition. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is only found between \(x=1\) and \(x=3\), the wave function is zero outside this region. The normalization condition requires that the integral of \(|\psi(x)|^2\) over this interval equals 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

### Step 1: Compute the integral
1. **First term**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = a^2 [\ln(4) - \ln(2)] = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second term**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \(a\)
Rearranging the equation:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

### Step 3: Match with options
The closest value to \(a \approx 0.849\) is **0.85**, which corresponds to option **B**.
