Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I'll try to visualize the structure. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. Wait, actually, numbering might be tricky. Wait, benzene is a ring, so the positions are 1, 2, and 3. Wait, maybe I should draw it out mentally. Let me think: assuming the numbering starts with the ethoxy group at position 1, then the tert-butyl is at position 2, and nitro at position 3. So the substituents are in the 1, 2, 3 positions, but wait that's a meta arrangement? No, wait, 1,2,3 are adjacent, so it's an ortho, meta arrangement relative to each other.

Wait, maybe I should think about the directing effects of each substituent. Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution, and the substituents can activate or deactivate the ring and direct incoming groups to specific positions.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy (-OEt), tert-butyl (t-Bu), and nitro (NO2). 

Wait, ethoxy is an activating group (since it's an electron-donating ether) and is ortho/para directing. Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Tert-butyl is a bulky, activating group (since alkyl groups are activating) and is ortho/para directing.

But the problem is the order in which these groups are added because each substitution affects where the next group will attach.

Let me think about the possible steps:

We start with benzene. The first substitution would determine the positions for the others.

Let me see, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me imagine the numbering: if ethoxy is at position 1, then tert-butyl is at 2, and nitro at 3. So in a 1,2,3 arrangement around the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is in a specific position relative to the others.

Wait, another approach: the synthesis steps. The options give different sequences. So perhaps I can think about the order of adding substituents.

Since nitro groups are meta directors, adding them after activating groups might make sense. But when adding nitro, you need a strong activating group to direct where it goes.

Wait, but nitro is a strong deactivating group, so it would deactivate the ring, making further substitutions difficult unless we have activating groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after an activating group like ethoxy or t-Bu.

Wait, let's think about the possible steps.

Option D starts with nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) as step i. So if the first step is nitration, then benzene would get a nitro group in a certain position. But benzene with nitration gives nitrobenzene. Then step ii is Fe/HCl. Fe/HCl is a catalyst for what? Wait, FeCl3 is a catalyst for electrophilic substitution. Wait, but in some cases, Fe/HCl might be used in the process of making a chloride, like in a nucleophilic substitution. Hmm, maybe it's for reducing something? Or perhaps it's for a Friedel-Crafts reaction. Wait, Friedel-Crafts requires AlCl3 as the catalyst, not FeCl3. So maybe that's a red herring.

Wait, perhaps I should figure out the order of adding substituents. Let's think about the target molecule: 1-ethoxy, 2-t-Bu, 3-nitro.

Alternatively, perhaps the positions are as follows: ethoxy is in position 1, nitro in 3, and t-Bu in 2.

Wait, but when adding substituents, the order matters because each substituent directs the next substitution.

So, let's think of possible sequences.

Option A) Steps: 

i) t-Bu chloride with AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds t-Bu group to benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation? Or perhaps sulfonation is a step for introducing a leaving group?

Wait, but SO3 is used in sulfonation, which adds a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H). That's a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Hmm, but in the target molecule, we don't have a sulfonic acid group. So maybe that's not part of the synthesis.

Alternatively, perhaps the SO3 is for making something else. Wait, maybe it's a sulfonating step which is later removed. Alternatively, maybe it's for sulfonation followed by something else.

Wait, but the target doesn't have any sulfonic group, so any sulfonation steps would need to be reversed, perhaps via a hydrolysis or something.

But that seems complicated. So perhaps the correct path doesn't include sulfonation. So looking at the options, perhaps options have steps with sulfonation which can be confusing.

Wait, let me think about another approach. Let's consider the nitro group. Nitro is a meta director. So if I add the nitro group early, say first, then the next substituent would be directed to the meta position relative to nitro.

But wait, in the target, the nitro is at position 3. So if we first nitrate benzene, the nitro group would be in a particular position. Then, adding ethoxy (which is activating) would direct incoming groups to ortho and para positions relative to itself, but in the ring, the nitro group would be in a position that affects where the next substituent goes.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ethoxy group. Because ethoxy is activating, and would direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions.

Wait, but if I first add ethoxy, then nitrate, where would the nitro group go?

Let me think: benzene → ethoxybenzene. Ethoxy is ortho/para directing. Then, when I nitrate, the nitro group would enter at the meta position relative to the ethoxy group. So if ethoxy is at position 1, nitro would be at position 3 (meta). Then, adding the t-Bu group would have to go to position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy and meta to nitro. But wait, t-Bu is an activating group and ortho/para directing.

Wait, but after adding nitro, the ring is deactivated, so adding another group would be challenging. Maybe that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added after the t-Bu group. Let's see.

So, starting with benzene.

1. Add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts alkylation (using t-BuCl and AlCl3). So the ring has a t-Bu group.

2. Then, add ethoxy group. Since t-Bu is activating and ortho/para directing, the ethoxy group would enter at ortho or para to t-Bu.

But in the target, ethoxy is at position 1, t-Bu at 2, so they are adjacent. So if t-Bu is at position 2, and ethoxy is at position 1 (ortho), that's possible.

3. Then, nitrate. But now, the ring has t-Bu and ethoxy. The ethoxy is activating, but the t-Bu is also activating. The nitration would be directed by whichever is more activating or has a stronger directing effect. But nitro is a deactivating group, so it would be added in a position that's ortho or para to the activating groups.

Wait, but if both t-Bu and ethoxy are present, how do the directing effects combine? They are both activating, but in different positions. So the nitro group would likely be added in a position that's either ortho or para to both, but that's tricky.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the actual structure. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Let's say I first add t-Bu at position 2. Then, adding ethoxy would go to position 1 (ortho) or 3 (meta?), but wait, ethoxy is ortho/para. Hmm.

Wait, if t-Bu is at position 2, then the ethoxy could go to position 1 (ortho) or position 3 (if it's para relative to t-Bu? Wait, no, t-Bu is at 2, so para would be position 6? Or maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this by considering the order of substituents and their directing effects.

Another approach: the target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, t-Bu, and nitro. To achieve the correct positions, the substituents must be added in an order where each new substituent is directed by the existing substituents.

Let me think of adding ethoxy first. Benzene → ethoxybenzene. Then, nitrate. Now, nitro would go meta to ethoxy, so at position 3. Then add t-Bu. But after adding nitro, the ring is deactivated, making Friedel-Crafts difficult because t-Bu is a bulky alkyl group, and Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups. So unless the ring has activating groups, adding t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts would not be feasible. So that sequence may not work.

Alternatively, perhaps add the t-Bu first. Benzene → t-Bu benzene. Then add ethoxy. Since t-Bu is ortho/para directing, ethoxy would go to position 1 (ortho) or 3 (meta) relative to t-Bu. Wait, no, t-Bu is at position 2. Then ethoxy would go to position 1 or 3 (ortho to t-Bu), but if t-Bu is at 2, then ortho would be 1 and 3. So ethoxy could be at 1 or 3. Which is correct in the target? Target has ethoxy at 1, t-Bu at 2. So if I add ethoxy next after t-Bu, it would be at position 1 (ortho) or 3 (meta). Hmm, but ethoxy is ortho/para to the t-Bu.

Wait, but in the target, ethoxy is at 1 and t-Bu at 2. So that's adjacent. So ethoxy is ortho to t-Bu. So that's possible.

After adding ethoxy, the ring would have t-Bu (position 2) and ethoxy (position 1). Now, for nitration. The nitro group is a strong deactivating group, so we need to choose where to add it. The activating groups (t-Bu and ethoxy) will direct incoming electrophiles.

In this case, with both t-Bu and ethoxy present, there might be competition in directing. Ethoxy is a stronger activating group than t-Bu perhaps, but both are activating. The positions available would be ortho, para to each.

Wait, if ethoxy is in position 1 and t-Bu in position 2, where would nitration occur? The available positions are 3, 4, 5,6.

Looking at ethoxy at 1: nitro would go to 3 (meta to ethoxy) or 5 (ortho?), but wait, wait, for ethoxy, it's ortho and para. So positions 2 (ortho), 4 (para) relative to ethoxy. Similarly, t-Bu at 2 would direct to positions 1 (ortho, already taken by ethoxy), 3 (ortho), and 5 (para).

So the possible positions are 3,4,5.

But in the target, nitro is at position 3. So maybe nitration occurs at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy and ortho to t-Bu. So how does that happen?

But considering the directing effects: activating groups (like ethoxy and t-Bu) are stronger than deactivating, but in this case, both are activating. So the incoming nitro group (which is a strong deactivating group) would be directed by the most activating group. Alternatively, the positions may be influenced by both substituents.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added next, but where? If I have t-Bu at 2 and ethoxy at 1, then the next substitution (nitration) would be directed by both groups. It could go into position 3, which is ortho to t-Bu and meta to ethoxy. Alternatively, could it go to position 4, which is para to ethoxy and meta to t-Bu.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps when two substituents are present, the incoming group goes into the position that is activated by both, if possible.

In this case, ethoxy at 1 and t-Bu at 2. The position 3 is ortho to t-Bu (so activated by t-Bu) and meta to ethoxy (so not as activated by ethoxy). Wait, but ethoxy is a strong activating group, so perhaps the nitro will go into position 3 because that's where t-Bu directs (ortho) and ethoxy doesn't direct there because it's meta. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group would enter where both substituents can direct. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nitro group is added before the ethoxy group. Let me try that pathway.

Start with benzene → nitrate → nitrobenzene. Then, add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts. But wait, nitro is deactivating, which makes the ring less reactive. Friedel-Crafts alkylation requires an activating group. So adding t-Bu after nitro would not work because the ring is deactivated.

So that's no good. So the nitro group can't be added first because then adding t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts would be difficult.

So perhaps the nitro group is added after both ethoxy and t-Bu are added. But then, the ring would be highly deactivated, making nitration difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after ethoxy but before t-Bu.

Wait, benzene → ethoxybenzene, then nitrate. Nitro would go meta to ethoxy, say position 3. Then, add t-Bu group. But the ring now has ethoxy at 1 and nitro at 3. Nitro is deactivating, so adding t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts would be difficult because the ring is deactivated by nitro. So that's a problem.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about the steps in each option and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at the options:

Option D: Steps are HNO3 first, then Fe/HCl, then t-BuCl/AlCl3, then HNO3 again, etc. Wait, but initial nitration would give nitrobenzene. Then what? Fe/HCl is a catalyst for what? Maybe it's a reduction step, but I'm not sure. Then, t-Bu via AlCl3. Friedel-Crafts can't proceed because nitro is deactivating. So that might not work.

Option C: Steps include t-BuCl first, then SO3 (sulfonation), then HNO3, etc. So benzene → t-Bu benzene. Then sulfonate. So now, the ring has t-Bu and a sulfonic acid group. Sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Then, nitration. Where would the nitro group go? It would be directed by the sulfonic acid group, which is meta.

But the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so this would complicate things. Unless the sulfonic acid is removed later. But I don't see any desulfonation steps in option C. So that's a problem.

Option B: Steps include t-BuCl first, then nitration, then Fe/HCl, then another nitration, etc. So benzene → t-Bu benzene. Then nitrate. Where? Since t-Bu is ortho/para, the nitro would go to position 3 (meta to t-Bu), but wait, t-Bu is at position 2. So nitro would go to position 5 or 3? Hmm, maybe position 3. Then, Fe/HCl. Not sure what that does. Maybe it's a step to remove something or facilitate another substitution. Then another nitration? That seems like adding more nitro groups, which the target doesn't have. So maybe option B isn't correct.

Option A: Steps are t-BuCl first, then nitration, then sulfonation, and so on. But again, the sulfonation may not be part of the target structure.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to first add the ethoxy group, then the t-Bu group, then the nitro group. Let me see which option does that.

Looking at the options, none of them start with ethoxy. Wait, the target has ethoxy, t-Bu, and nitro. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, all the options start with t-BuCl (AlCl3) or HNO3. Option D starts with HNO3.

Wait, but in the target, the ethoxy is at position 1. So perhaps ethoxy is added via an etherification, like using an ethyl halide in a nucleophilic substitution, but that doesn't fit with Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, ethoxy group can be introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that typically requires a strong activating group like a nitro group already present, which isn't the case at the beginning.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution of a leaving group, but that usually requires a strongly activating group, which would have to be present first.

So, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced last, after nitro group is already present. But earlier I thought that might not be feasible because nitro deactivates the ring.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the steps again.

If I first add t-Bu group, then nitro group, then ethoxy. But how?

Wait, after adding t-Bu, I can add nitro. But t-Bu is activating. Nitration would be possible and would add nitro in a position directed by t-Bu, which is ortho or para.

If t-Bu is at position 2, then nitration would go to position 1 (ortho) or 5 (para). Alternatively, if t-Bu is at position 2, the nitro could be at position 6 (para), but I'm not sure.

Wait, but then adding ethoxy would require activating the ring, which may not be possible if nitro is present.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think about each option's reaction steps and see which one leads to the target.

Option D: Steps are

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro group added.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe a reduction? Or a substitution?

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation.

iv) HNO3 again → another nitration?

But starting with nitro, then adding t-Bu. But after nitro is added, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts may not proceed. So perhaps option D is incorrect.

Looking at option B: steps are

i) t-BuCl → alkylation.

ii) nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl.

iv) nitration again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+/H2O/Heat → hydrolysis to form something else.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps an SN2 substitution, like Williamson ether synthesis.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → perhaps hydrolysis.

This seems complicated, but trying to follow:

1. Add t-Bu → benzene becomes t-Bu benzene.

2. Nitrate → nitro group added, directed by t-Bu. Nitro goes ortho or para to t-Bu.

Suppose t-Bu is at position 2, nitro could be at position 1 (ortho) or 3 (meta?), but t-Bu is ortho/para directing. Wait, nitro would go to position 1 or 3.

If nitro is at 1, then t-Bu is at 2, and nitro is at 1. Then, step iii is Fe/HCl. Not sure what that does. Maybe it's for a substitution.

Then step iv is another nitration. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps this path isn't correct.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate. Now ring has t-Bu and sulfonic acid.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate. Would go meta to sulfonic acid, which is in a certain position.

But again, the target doesn't have sulfonic acid, so perhaps this step isn't part of the correct path.

Option A:

i) t-BuCl → alkylation.

ii) nitration.

iii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+/H2O/Heat → perhaps another reaction, like hydrolyzing a diazonium salt.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → SN2 for substitution.

viii) Fe/HCl → maybe a substitution.

ix) HNO3 again.

This seems too long and I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to first add ethoxy, then t-Bu, then nitro. But how to do that.

Wait, another approach: the target has ethoxy, t-Bu, and nitro. So perhaps the nitro is added last. Let me see.

So, if we first add t-Bu, then ethoxy, then nitro. Let's see.

Start with benzene.

1. Add t-BuCl with AlCl3 → t-Bu benzene.

2. Add ethoxy group. Since t-Bu is activating and ortho/para directing, ethoxy would go to ortho or para of t-Bu.

Assuming t-Bu is at position 2, ethoxy would go to position 1 (ortho) or 3 (para to t-Bu?) Wait, t-Bu is at 2, so para would be position 6. So ethoxy would go to 1 (ortho) or 3 (meta to t-Bu, which is not directed. Wait, no, t-Bu is ortho/para directing, so ethoxy would go to 1 (ortho) or 6 (para). Hmm. So if t-Bu is at 2, ethoxy at 1 or 6.

Wait, but in the target, ethoxy is at 1, t-Bu at 2. So that's possible. So step 2: add ethoxy at 1.

Now, the ring has t-Bu at 2 and ethoxy at 1. Next, nitrate. The nitro group would be directed by the activating groups. Ethoxy is a strong activating group (ortho/para), so nitration would likely occur meta to ethoxy. Since ethoxy is at 1, meta would be position 4. But then, the target has nitro at 3. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro is directed by t-Bu. If nitro is added after ethoxy, the ethoxy is more activating, so nitro would go meta to ethoxy, which is position 4. But target has nitro at 3. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something about the directing effects.

Wait, maybe the nitro group is added in a position that's ortho to t-Bu and meta to ethoxy. So, position 3. Because t-Bu is at 2 and ethoxy at 1, position 3 is ortho to t-Bu and meta to ethoxy. So maybe nitro goes there.

But how to direct it there.

Wait, let's think about the activating groups. Ethoxy is at 1, t-Bu at 2. Both are activating. The nitro group is a strong deactivating group, so perhaps it's added in a position that is ortho to t-Bu (since t-Bu is activating) and meta to ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added into position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu (position 2) and next to ethoxy (position 1).

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the order is to add ethoxy first, then t-Bu, then nitro. Let's see.

1. Benzene → ethoxybenzene via, say, ethylation using an electrophilic substitution. But with benzene, how to add ethoxy? Friedel-Crafts isn't suitable for ethers. Wait, usually, ethoxy groups can be introduced via nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a strongly activating group already present. Alternatively, perhaps via a nitration followed by substitution, but that might not be straightforward.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group can be added via a SN2 mechanism, but that requires a good leaving group on the ring, which isn't present at the start.

Hmm, maybe the ethoxy is added after some other groups have been added.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add t-Bu group.

2. Add ethoxy group.

3. Add nitro group.

Let me try that.

Step 1: Add t-Bu. Benzene → t-Bu benzene.

Step 2: Add ethoxy. Since t-Bu is activating and ortho/para, ethoxy could go to position 1 (ortho) or 3 (meta? No, t-Bu is ortho/para, so 1 and 6 would be ortho and para. Wait, t-Bu at 2: ortho positions are 1 and 3, para is 6.

So ethoxy would go to position 1 or 3.

If placed at 1, then nitration would be directed. Nitro would go meta to ethoxy, which is position 4.

But target has nitro at 3.

Alternatively, if ethoxy is at 3, then nitro would be meta to ethoxy, position 6.

Hmm, not matching the target.

Wait, maybe the nitro is added first. But that doesn't work because the ring is deactivated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is t-Bu, then nitro, then ethoxy, but that seems problematic because after nitro, ring is deactivated.

Wait, perhaps the nitro is added via a different mechanism.

Wait, another idea: perhaps nitration is done under specific conditions where it can still proceed despite the deactivation.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about each option again.

Looking at the options, perhaps the correct option is D, but I'm not sure.

Option D steps:

i) nitrate → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe a substitution or reduction.

iii) t-BuCl → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts wouldn't proceed. So perhaps this is impossible.

Thus, option D is unlikely.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl → benzene becomes t-Bu benzene.

ii) nitrate → nitro group added. Where? Ortho or para to t-Bu. Let's say position 1 (ortho).

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe a substitution, like converting nitro to amine via Fe/HCl. Wait, nitrobenzene with Fe/HCl gives aniline. So nitro group is converted to amino.

iv) nitrate again → but aniline is strongly activating, so the next nitration would be in a position directed by the amine. But I'm not sure.

But the target has nitro, not amine.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the target, it has a nitro group. So perhaps the nitration step must be done before any steps that would remove the nitro group.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added, then converted into something else, then re-introduced. That seems complicated.

Wait, another approach: the target has nitro at position 3. So perhaps, when adding the nitro group, the existing substituents must direct it to position 3.

So, steps leading to that.

Option A: Steps i to ix.

i) t-BuCl → t-Bu benzene.

ii) nitrate → nitro group added, let's say at position 1 (ortho to t-Bu).

iii) SO3 → sulfonate, adds a sulfonic acid group (strong deactivating, meta director).

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization, but under what conditions? If the ring is strongly deactivating, would that proceed?

v) dilute H2SO4 → perhaps hydrolysis of a diazonium salt.

vi) H3O+/H2O/Heat → maybe another hydrolysis or substitution.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → SN2 substitution, perhaps replacing a leaving group with ethoxy.

viii) Fe/HCl → maybe converting a nitro group to amine, but then step ix is nitration again.

Wait, that seems convoluted, but perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 substitution. For that, I think we would need a good leaving group, like a tosylate or something. But in the steps, I don't see that.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for which option correctly orders the substituents.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So substituents are at 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), 3 (nitro).

Now, the order of addition:

- t-Bu at 2.

- ethoxy at 1.

- nitro at 3.

So the question is, how to get nitro at position 3, given that after adding ethoxy and t-Bu, the ring is activated, but nitro is deactivating.

Wait, perhaps the nitro is added after ethoxy and t-Bu. But that would require the ring to be activated enough for nitration.

Wait, but t-Bu is activating, ethoxy is activating, so perhaps even with both, the ring is active enough for nitration.

So:

1. Add t-Bu → t-Bu benzene.

2. Add ethoxy → directed by t-Bu's ortho/para, so ethoxy at position 1.

3. Now, the ring has t-Bu at 2 and ethoxy at 1. Next, nitrate. Nitro would be directed by ethoxy (meta) and t-Bu (ortho). But the position available is 3, which is ortho to t-Bu and meta to ethoxy. So nitro would go there.

So that's the desired structure. So the order is t-Bu → ethoxy → nitro.

Now, looking at the options, which option follows this sequence?

Looking at the options:

Which option adds t-Bu first, then ethoxy, then nitro?

Looking at each option:

Option A:

i) t-BuCl → adds t-Bu.

ii) nitrate → adds nitro.

iii) SO3 → sulfonate.

So after nitro, sulfonate is added, which isn't part of the target. So no.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl → adds t-Bu.

ii) nitrate → adds nitro.

But then step iii is Fe/HCl, which I'm not sure about. Then step iv is another nitrate. So maybe not.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl → adds t-Bu.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) nitrate → adds nitro.

Not the order we want.

Option D:

i) nitrate.

Nope, that doesn't fit.

Wait, none of the options directly follow t-Bu → ethoxy → nitro. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a different method, like a nucleophilic substitution, which requires a leaving group. So perhaps a bromine is introduced, then replaced with ethoxy.

But in the options, I don't see any steps that add a bromine before ethoxy.

Wait, looking at the options, some have steps with NaOH and EtBr. For example, option B has step vii) NaOH/EtBr.

NaOH and EtBr would be for an SN2 substitution, replacing a bromide with ethoxy. So perhaps a bromine is introduced earlier, then replaced with ethoxy.

So, the steps would be:

1. Add t-Bu.

2. Introduce a bromine at a position.

3. Replace bromine with ethoxy.

4. Nitrate.

But how.

Wait, perhaps the bromine is introduced via a substitution after t-Bu and nitro.

Wait, this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added through an etherification using a nitration step followed by substitution.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the correct order is t-Bu, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Looking back at the options, perhaps none of them have this exact sequence, but I might have to choose the closest.

Wait, looking at option B:

i) t-BuCl → adds t-Bu.

ii) nitration → adds nitro.

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduces nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again → but not sure.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo.

vi) H3O+ → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy substitution.

viii) SO3 → sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

This seems to be adding ethoxy at the end. So after nitration, amine, then substitution, etc. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B.

Wait, perhaps the steps in option B are:

1. t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

2. HNO3 → nitro group.

3. Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

4. HNO3 → nitrate again, but the ring is activated by amine.

Wait, but the target has nitro, not amine, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess.

Wait, let me think about the nitration step. The nitro group needs to be added in a position that's ortho to t-Bu and meta to ethoxy. The only way that can happen is if the ethoxy is already present and directing the nitration.

So, the correct order is:

Add t-Bu → ethoxy → nitro.

But none of the options have this order. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added after nitro, but that would require the ring to be activated.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add ethoxy.

2. Add t-Bu.

3. Nitrate.

But how to add ethoxy first.

Wait, the only way to add ethoxy via electrophilic substitution is if it's through an activating group. So perhaps first nitrate, but that deactivates the ring, making the next steps difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after nitro is added.

Wait, another approach: The target has the nitro group at position 3. So, when the nitro group is added, the existing substituents must direct it to position 3.

So, if the ring has ethoxy and t-Bu, nitration occurs at position 3.

But ethoxy is at position 1, t-Bu at 2. Position 3 is ortho to t-Bu and meta to ethoxy.

So, the nitration would be directed by t-Bu to position 3 (ortho), but also not directed by ethoxy. So the nitration would be at position 3.

Putting it all together, the order is t-Bu → ethoxy → nitro.

But checking the options, none have this exact order. So perhaps the correct option is the one that starts with t-BuCl, then nitration, then ethoxy.

Wait, but how to add ethoxy after nitration, which deactivates the ring.

Ah, unless the ethoxy is added via a substitution, not electrophilic substitution.

So, perhaps the nitro group is added first via nitration, then a bromine is introduced (like in a substitution), then replaced with ethoxy.

But looking at the options, some have steps with NaOH and EtBr, which is for substitution.

Looking at option B:

i) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

ii) nitrate → nitro.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again → another nitro group.

Wait, but that would give two nitro groups, which the target doesn't have.

Hmm. This is really confusing. I think I'm going to have to go with option D.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

The target has ethoxy, t-Bu, and nitro. The nitro must be added in a position that's ortho to t-Bu and meta to ethoxy.

The steps in option D:

i) nitrate → nitro.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) t-BuCl → but the ring is now activated (amine is activating), so t-Bu can be added via Friedel-Crafts.

iv) nitrate → another nitro group added.

But target only has one nitro. So this seems incorrect.

Looking again, perhaps the correct option is B.

In option B, after adding t-Bu and nitro, Fe/HCl is used. If the nitro group is present, Fe/HCl would reduce it to an amine. Then, adding another nitro group? This doesn't fit the target.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. I'll have to make a guess based on the steps involving adding t-Bu first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Wait, none of the options have that, but perhaps option C does something similar.

Option C steps:

i) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo.

vi) HNO3 again → another nitro?

vii) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps option B is correct. Let me think again.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl → t-Bu.

ii) HNO3 → nitro at position 1 (ortho to t-Bu).

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again. But the ring is activated by amine, so nitration would occur, but where?

Alternatively, perhaps after reduction, the amine directs the next nitration to a certain position.

But this seems off.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

t-Bu → nitro → ethoxy.

But how to add ethoxy after nitro.

Perhaps via substitution. If after nitration, a bromine is introduced, then replaced with ethoxy.

Looking for an option that has steps after nitration to introduce a bromine and then substitute with ethoxy.

Looking at option B, step vii) is NaOH/EtBr, which is for substitution. So perhaps:

1. t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

2. HNO3 → nitro.

3. Fe/HCl → perhaps nothing, but later steps:

4. HNO3 → another nitro? Not sure.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. I think I'll have to go with the option that starts with t-Bu, then nitro, then ethoxy via substitution.

So, looking at the options, option B has everything except perhaps the correct order.

Alternatively, considering the options again, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, no, in option D, the first step is nitration, which would deactivate the ring, making Friedel-Crafts alkylation impossible. So option D can't be correct.

After much consideration, I think the correct sequence is t-Bu → ethoxy → nitro, but since none of the options directly have that, perhaps the correct option is option B.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option B.

Wait, I'm getting extremely stuck. Maybe it's time to make an educated guess. Based on the target structure and the substituent directions, the correct order is adding t-Bu first, then ethoxy, then nitro. Looking at the options, none have this exact order, but the steps in option B could somehow accommodate this.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the nitro group in the target is at position 3. So, when adding nitro, the existing substituents (t-Bu and ethoxy) should direct it to position 3.

If ethoxy is at 1 and t-Bu at 2, then position 3 is meta to ethoxy and ortho to t-Bu. So the nitro group would be directed there by both substituents.

Thus, the correct sequence is adding ethoxy first, then t-Bu, then nitro. But how to add ethoxy first.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution, which requires a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B because after adding t-Bu and nitro, then substituting to add ethoxy.

Wait, no, because adding ethoxy after nitro would require the ring to be activated.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck and have to make a guess. Based on the steps, I think the correct option is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy (-OEt) at position 1, tert-butyl (t-Bu) at position 2, and nitro (NO₂) at position 3. The analysis focuses on the directing effects of these substituents during electrophilic aromatic substitution and the feasibility of each reaction sequence provided in the options.

### Key Analysis of the Target Structure and Substituent Effects:
1. **Ethoxy (-OEt)**: An activating, ortho/para-directing group.
2. **Tert-butyl (t-Bu)**: An activating, ortho/para-directing group.
3. **Nitro (NO₂)**: A deactivating, meta-directing group.

The nitro group must be added in a position that is ortho to t-Bu and meta to ethoxy. This requires careful consideration of the order of substitution to ensure proper directing.

### Analysis of Each Option:
#### **Option A**:
- Sequence: t-BuCl → HNO₃ → SO₃ → NaNO₂ → H₃O⁺/H₂O → NaOH/EtBr → Fe/HCl → HNO₃ → dilute H₂SO₄.
- Adds t-Bu first, then nitro, and introduces a sulfonic acid group (SO₃). However, the target molecule does not contain a sulfonic acid group, making this sequence inconsistent with the target.

#### **Option B**:
- Sequence: t-BuCl → HNO₃ → Fe/HCl → HNO₃ → NaNO₂ → H₃O⁺/H₂O → NaOH/EtBr → SO₃ → dilute H₂SO₄.
- Adds t-Bu first, followed by nitro. Fe/HCl may reduce the nitro group to an amine, and subsequent steps involve additional nitration and substitution. However, the sequence does not clearly align with the target structure, as it involves multiple nitration steps and introduces a sulfonic acid group.

#### **Option C**:
- Sequence: t-BuCl → SO₃ → HNO₃ → Fe/HCl → NaNO₂ → H₃O⁺/H₂O → NaOH/EtBr → HNO₃ → dilute H₂SO₄.
- Adds t-Bu first, followed by sulfonation (SO₃). The target molecule does not contain a sulfonic acid group, making this sequence inconsistent.

#### **Option D**:
- Sequence: HNO₃ → Fe/HCl → t-BuCl → HNO₃ → NaNO₂ → SO₃ → dilute H₂SO₄ → H₃O⁺/H₂O → NaOH/EtBr.
- Begins with nitration, which deactivates the ring, making subsequent Friedel-Crafts alkylation (t-BuCl) unlikely to proceed. This sequence is not feasible.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence must involve adding t-Bu first, followed by ethoxy, and finally nitro. However, none of the options explicitly follow this order. Based on the analysis, **Option B** is the closest match, as it attempts to introduce t-Bu and nitro in a manner that could potentially align with the target structure, despite some inconsistencies.
