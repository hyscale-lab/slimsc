Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these synthesis pathways. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a sequence of reactions. I need to figure out the correct order of reactions that would yield the desired compound with high yield.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule to visualize it better. The structure is a benzene ring with three substituents:

- At position 1: an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3)
- At position 2: a tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3)
- At position 3: a nitro group (-NO2)

So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, wait, numbering in benzene rings can be tricky. Let me think about the positions again. In the compound 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, the numbering starts such that the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so if substituents are at 1, 2, and 3, they are adjacent in a row. Hmm, is that correct?

Wait no, the numbering is such that substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So if substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, that's a meta arrangement for some of them, but I think I need to think about the directing effects of each group to determine the order of adding substituents.

So, the plan is to add substituents one by one, considering the directing effects each group has on the next substitution. Electrophilic substitution reactions are influenced by the directing groups present.

Let's list the substituents:

- tert-butyl group: it's a strong activating group (since it's an alkyl group) and is ortho/para directing.
- ethoxy group: similar to tert-butyl, it's activating and ortho/para directing.
- nitro group: it's a strong deactivating, meta directing group.

Wait, but nitro is a strong deactivating group. So when adding substituents, we might need to add the nitro group last because once it's attached, it would deactivate the ring, making further substitutions difficult. Alternatively, perhaps we can add the nitro group earlier, but then we have to consider the activating groups.

Wait, but nitro is meta-directing. So when adding nitro, the substituents before it would influence where it goes.

I think the strategy should be to add the activating groups first because they make the ring more reactive, allowing for better substitution. Once the ring has activating groups, adding deactivating groups becomes more challenging because the ring becomes less reactive, but perhaps if done in a way that the directing effects are taken into account, it can work.

Let me think about the target structure again. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. Alternatively, perhaps I need to arrange them differently based on the order of addition.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that each new group is added in a position that's ortho or para to an existing group.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, if I imagine the benzene ring, substituents are in the 1, 2, 3 positions. That means they are adjacent to each other in a row. So, ethoxy at position 1, next to it is tert-butyl at 2, and then nitro at 3. So, how can that happen?

Wait, but in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, then 2 and 3 are adjacent, making a row of three substituents. But how can that be achieved through electrophilic substitution? Because each substitution affects where the next group goes.

I think the key is to determine the order in which substituents are added. Let's consider that the nitro group is deactivating, so it's best added last. So, perhaps the ethoxy and tert-butyl are added first, and then the nitro group is introduced.

Wait, but the nitro group is meta directing, so when it's added, its position is determined by the existing groups. Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is added before some of the other groups. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should outline a possible sequence.

Let me think: starting with benzene. The first substitution could be adding the tert-butyl group. So, we'd use a Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3 as a catalyst. Since the ring is activated, this would attach the tert-butyl group at some position.

But wait, benzene is symmetric, so the first substituent can be added anywhere. Let's say we add tert-butyl first. Then, the ring has a tert-butyl group, which is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. The next substituent could be the ethoxy group. To add ethoxy, we can perform an etherification, perhaps through a nucleophilic substitution or using another electrophilic substitution method.

Wait, wait, ethoxy is an -OEt group. Adding an ethoxy group via electrophilic substitution would typically involve generating an appropriate electrophile. Maybe using ethyl nitrate, or perhaps using a Williamson synthesis after a nitration, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using a Friedel-Crafts acylation isn't suitable here. Wait, no, ethoxylation might be done via a different method.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group can be added via a substitution reaction. For example, if we have a benzene ring with a leaving group, like a nitro group, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that usually requires a strongly activated ring or a meta director, which complicates things.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group can be introduced by first forming a phenol, then converting it to an ethoxy group. But that would involve multiple steps. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via an alkoxy group substitution. So perhaps, first, we add the tert-butyl group, then perform some reaction to introduce the ethoxy group.

Wait, let me think about the options again. Let's look at the reaction steps given in the options. Each option lists a sequence of reactions, so perhaps I can match the steps to the substituents.

The target molecule has:

- tert-butyl (from Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3)
- ethoxy (probably from alkoxy group introduction, perhaps via nucleophilic substitution or another electrophilic substitution)
- nitro (from nitration)

So, in the options, each step is a reaction that adds a substituent or modifies the structure.

Looking at the options, let me see what each sequence does.

Option D starts with HNO3/H2SO4, which is nitration. Then Fe/HCl (maybe a reduction?), then AlCl3 with tert-butyl chloride. Hmm, but adding nitro first would make the ring less reactive, making Friedel-Crafts harder. Because Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group, and nitro is deactivating. So if we start with nitration, then try Friedel-Crafts alkylation, the ring is deactivated, and the alkylation might not occur. So that might not be a good approach.

Option A: first step is tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3, Friedel-Crafts. Then HNO3/H2SO4, which is nitration. Then SO3/H2SO4, which could be sulfonation. Then NaNO2/HCl (maybe diazotization), dilute H2SO4, H3O+ and heat (could be hydrolysis?), Fe/HCl (maybe a reduction?), then HNO3/H2SO4 again. That seems a bit complicated, but perhaps the nitration is done after the Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, but after adding tert-butyl, the next substituent would be influenced by it. So, if we nitrate the benzene with a tert-butyl group, where would the nitro group go? The tert-butyl is ortho/para directing. So if the ring has tert-butyl at position 2, then the nitro group could go at position 1 or 3 (ortho and para to the tert-butyl). But wait, the target has nitro at position 3. So if the nitro is added after tert-butyl, and the ethoxy is also to be added, how would that work?

Wait, I think I need to plan the order of substituents so that each subsequent substitution is directed correctly by the existing groups.

Let me outline a possible synthetic pathway:

1. Add ethoxy group first. Wait, but benzene doesn't have any substituents, so adding ethoxy would require a method like using a nitration followed by reduction, but that's not straightforward. Alternatively, maybe using a Friedel-Crafts acylation to add an acyl group, then reduce it to an alcohol, then convert to an ether. That seems a bit involved, but it's a possibility. Let me think: benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation (add acetyl group) → reduce with H2/Ni to form phenylmethanol → then perform an SN2 with ethyl bromide and a base? But I'm not sure if that would work directly. Alternatively, perhaps using a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that usually requires strong activating groups.

Wait, another approach: maybe the ethoxy group can be introduced via an alkoxy group substitution after the ring has activating groups. So, perhaps adding ethoxy as the first substituent isn't the best approach.

Alternative plan:

1. Add the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Now, the ring has a tert-butyl group which is activating and ortho/para directing.

2. Next, add the ethoxy group. Since the ring is activated by tert-butyl, the nitration could be next. Wait, but the ethoxy is also an activating group. Hmm, perhaps adding ethoxy next would influence where the nitro group goes.

Wait, let me think again. Let me consider the order in which substituents are added.

If I add tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro:

- After tert-butyl, the ring is activated. Adding ethoxy (ortho/para to tert-butyl) would place it either ortho or para. Then, when adding nitro, which is deactivating and meta directing, the positions would be influenced by the existing ethoxy and tert-butyl groups.

Wait, but if the ethoxy is added next, the ring would have two activating groups. Let me try to visualize.

Suppose after adding tert-butyl (position 2), then ethoxy is added in position 1 (ortho to tert-butyl). Now, when adding nitro, the existing groups are ethoxy (ortho to tert-butyl) and tert-butyl.

But each substituent directs the next substitution. The ethoxy is ortho/para directing, and the tert-butyl is also ortho/para. So, when adding nitro, the positions available would be influenced by both. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first. But as I thought earlier, adding nitro first would deactivate the ring, making any subsequent electrophilic substitution (like Friedel-Crafts) difficult because the ring is less reactive. So that's probably not the best approach.

Wait, maybe the nitro is added last. So, after adding both tert-butyl and ethoxy groups, we nitrate the ring. But in that case, the nitro group would be directed by the existing substituents.

The target has nitro at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and tert-butyl at 2. So, when adding the nitro group last, where would it be placed? The existing groups (ethoxy at 1 and tert-butyl at 2) would direct the nitro group.

Let me imagine the benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy) and 2 (tert-butyl). The next substituent (nitro) needs to be at position 3. Let's see how that would happen.

Looking at the ethoxy group at position 1: as an activating, ortho/para director, it would direct incoming groups to positions 2 and 4 (ortho and para to position 1). Similarly, the tert-butyl at position 2 directs to positions 1, 3, and 5 (ortho and para relative to position 2).

Wait, but if I'm trying to add the nitro group at position 3, which is ortho to the tert-butyl at 2. So, when adding the nitro group, the tert-butyl group would direct it to position 3 (ortho to 2), which is what we want. But the ethoxy group at 1 would direct to positions 2 and 4. Hmm, so perhaps the nitro group is directed by the tert-butyl group to position 3.

But wait, the nitro group is a strong deactivating group. So when adding the nitro group, the ring is activated by the ethoxy and tert-butyl, so the nitration would occur at the most activated position that is favored by both groups.

Wait, but in reality, when multiple substituents are present, the most activating group has the strongest influence. So if both ethoxy and tert-butyl are present, both are activating, so the nitro group will go to a position that is ortho/para to both, if possible. But in this case, the target has nitro at position 3, which is ortho to the tert-butyl at position 2 and meta to the ethoxy at position 1. So, perhaps the tert-butyl group is the dominant director here.

Let me plan the steps:

1. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts. So first step: benzene + AlCl3, tert-butyl chloride.

2. Next, add ethoxy group. How? Maybe via a nucleophilic substitution after making a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps using a different method. Wait, perhaps making a phenol first and then converting it to an ether.

Wait, but that requires more steps. Alternatively, maybe using a coupling reaction or another substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group can be added via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by reduction, but that seems complicated.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is added via an etherification using a good leaving group. For example, if I have a nitro group in a position that can be replaced by an ethoxide. But wait, that would require the nitro group to be present first, which I thought wasn't the best approach.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for a reaction sequence that introduces the ethoxy group after adding the tert-butyl group. So, after Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add tert-butyl, the next step could be introducing the ethoxy group.

Wait, perhaps using a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the ring would need to be strongly activated towards nucleophilic attack. But nitro groups are deactivating and meta-directing, which isn't helpful here. Alternatively, perhaps using a directing group that is good for nucleophilic substitution.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group can be introduced via an alkylation after introducing a directing group.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl group (Friedel-Crafts)
2. Add ethoxy group via electrophilic substitution. How? Maybe using an ethyl nitrite to form an electrophilic species. Or perhaps using a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution where a leaving group is present. But how do I get a leaving group on the benzene ring? Maybe through diazonium salt formation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps introduce a nitro group, then reduce it to an amino group, then perform a substitution. But that might complicate things.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the options again. Each option lists a series of reactions. I need to see which sequence correctly adds the substituents in the right order.

Looking at option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds tert-butyl.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Sulfuric acid with SO3 would introduce a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Wait, but that's a new substituent. But in the target molecule, there's no sulfonic acid group. So perhaps this step is not necessary. Hmm, that's confusing.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate the ring. So now, the ring has tert-butyl and nitro groups. But nitro is deactivating, so next steps would be harder.

Then iii) Fe/HCl → possibly a reduction. Fe/HCl is a reagent for reducing nitro groups to amines. So, if we have a nitro group, using Fe/HCl would reduce it to an amino group. But in the target, there's no amino group. So that might not fit.

Wait, but after nitration, having a nitro group would direct further substituents to the meta positions. But in our target, we have an ethoxy group that's at position 1, which is adjacent to the tert-butyl at position 2. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene. Now, the ring has a nitro group, which is deactivating and meta-directing.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amino. But the target doesn't have an amino group, so perhaps this is a way to install another group.

But this seems off track because after nitration and reduction, the ring is activated again with an amino group, which is a strong activating, ortho/para director. Then, adding tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts would be possible.

But I'm not sure if this leads to the correct positions.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. Now, the ring has tert-butyl and nitro groups.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate. Wait, but target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group. So this may not be correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option doesn't include sulfonation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group can be introduced via an SN2 reaction. For example, if a good leaving group is present, like a nitro group, but that's not helpful since nitro is deactivating.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after making a nitro group into a good leaving group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the steps involve adding the ethoxy group using a different method. Let me think: perhaps introducing an ethoxy group via a Friedel-Crafts acylation, then reducing it. But that seems more involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via an etherification using a phenol. For example, first introduce a phenol group, then convert it to an ethoxy group using Williamson ether synthesis, but that would require multiple steps not listed in the options.

Wait, looking back at the options, I notice that some steps involve NaOH and EtBr. That sounds like an SN2 reaction. For example, if we have a good leaving group (like a nitro group), perhaps it can be replaced by an ethoxy group.

Wait, but nitro groups aren't good leaving groups. Alternatively, perhaps a nitro group is reduced to an amino group, which is a better leaving group? No, amino groups are not good leaving groups unless under specific conditions.

Wait, another thought. If we have a nitro group at a certain position, perhaps we can perform a reduction to an amino group, then a diazotization, and then a substitution.

Wait, in some cases, diazonium salts can be used to substitute groups. For example, a diazonium salt can be treated with a nucleophile like an alkoxide ion to form an ether. But I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Option C:

i) Friedel-Crafts to add tert-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonic acid group. But target doesn't have that, so probably not.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again? That seems odd, and the target only has one nitro group.

Option D:

i) nitrate.

ii) reduce nitro to amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts to add tert-butyl.

iv) nitrate again.

Hmm, but then where is the ethoxy group?

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group comes from another substitution. Looking at option D's steps:

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

vii) dilute H2SO4.

viii) H3O+/H2O/heat → hydrolysis?

ix) NaOH/EtBr → SN2 substitution.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

After nitration and reduction, adding tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts, then another nitration, then diazotization, sulfonation, hydrolysis, and substitution.

This seems convoluted, and I'm not sure if it would lead to the correct structure.

Option A:

After adding tert-butyl and nitrating, the steps involve sulfonation, which I don't think is part of the target structure.

Hmm, perhaps the correct sequence is adding tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

But how to add the ethoxy group after tert-butyl?

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via an alkoxy group substitution. Let me think: if I have a nitro group in a position that can be replaced by an ethoxide, but nitro isn't a good leaving group. Alternatively, if the nitro group is converted into a better leaving group, like a nitroso or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after the ring has a good leaving group. For example, a nitro group could be converted into an amino group, which is then treated with a nitrous acid to form a diazonium salt, which can undergo substitution with an ethoxide.

Wait, let me outline a possible pathway:

1. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Nitrate the ring to add a nitro group. Now, the ring has tert-butyl and nitro.

3. Reduce the nitro group to an amine using Fe/HCl.

4. Treat the amine with NaNO2 and HCl to form a diazonium salt.

5. Perform a substitution with an ethoxide ion. This would replace the diazonium group with an ethoxy group.

But wait, the target has nitro at position 3, so perhaps the nitro group isn't being replaced but is being added in a different position. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add ethoxy via nucleophilic substitution, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a Friedel-Crafts etherification, but I don't think Friedel-Crafts is used for ethers. That's typically for acylations or alkylation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction where a nitro group is replaced with an ethoxy group. So, nitro → amino → diazonium → substitution with ethoxide.

Let me try that:

1. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Nitrate the ring to add nitro group (now, ring has tert-butyl and nitro).

3. Reduce nitro to amine (using Fe/HCl).

4. Treat amine with NaNO2 and HCl (diazotization) to form diazonium chloride.

5. Perform substitution with ethoxide (NaOH and EtBr?), but wait, EtBr is a good electrophile, but I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxide is introduced via an SN2 reaction with a good leaving group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, looking at the options, several have steps involving NaOH and EtBr. For example, option D has step ix) NaOH/EtBr. That might be an SN2 reaction, replacing a leaving group with ethoxy.

So perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add nitro group.

3. Reduce nitro to amine.

4. Diazotize to form diazonium salt.

5. Substitute with ethoxide to form ethoxy group.

But I'm not sure how that would fit into the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added after the nitro group via a substitution, but I'm not seeing it clearly.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option's steps and see which leads to the correct substituents.

Let's take option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl: reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts → since the ring is activated by amine, the alkylation would add tert-butyl.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate again → but where? The ring now has an amine and tert-butyl. The amine is activating, ortho/para. So the nitration would probably be ortho or para to the amine, but in the target, the nitro is in a different position.

Wait, but after adding nitro again, the ring would have nitro, amine, and tert-butyl. Then, the steps include NaNO2/HCl (diazotization), then SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation), then dilute H2SO4, H3O+/H2O/heat, and finally NaOH/EtBr.

Hmm, this seems complicated and I'm not sure if it leads to the correct structure.

Let me think about option B:

i) Friedel-Crafts adds tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate → nitro group added.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again → another nitro group?

But the target has only one nitro group. So this might not be right.

Option C:

i) Friedel-Crafts adds tert-butyl.

ii) sulfonate → adds a sulfonic acid group.

But the target doesn't have that, so perhaps this is wrong.

Option D's steps after adding nitro and then amine, then adding tert-butyl:

iii) Friedel-Crafts → adds tert-butyl.

So the ring now has amine and tert-butyl. Then, iv) nitrate again → adds another nitro group. Hmm, not matching the target.

Alternatively, option A's steps:

i) Friedel-Crafts → tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate → nitro.

iii) sulfonate → sulfonic acid.

But target doesn't have that.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming the order of addition. Maybe the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after the nitro group is in place.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is the first substituent. Let me think:

1. Add ethoxy via some method. For example, perhaps via a nucleophilic substitution, but benzene is not reactive enough for that. Alternatively, using a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by reduction to form a phenol, then converting to ethoxy.

But none of the options seem to include that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an ether formation using a leaving group. For example, if the ring has a nitro group, which can be converted into a good leaving group, then an ethoxide can substitute it.

But nitro isn't a good leaving group. However, if we reduce the nitro group to an amine, then treat it with nitrous acid to form a diazonium salt, which can be displaced by an ethoxide.

So steps would be:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Diazotize aniline → diazonium chloride.

4. Substitute with ethoxide → forms ethoxy group.

But then, the ring has an ethoxy group and a nitro group from the initial nitration. Hmm, but wait, after step 2, the ring has an ethoxy group? Or no, after substitution, the ethoxy group replaces the amine.

Wait, let me correct that:

After nitration, we have nitrobenzene.

Reduce nitro to amine: aniline.

Diazotize to form diazonium salt.

Substitute with ethoxide: benzene with ethoxy group.

But where is the nitro group? Oh, wait, the nitro group was reduced to amine and then substituted. So the nitro group is replaced by ethoxy. Hmm, that's not what we want.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ethoxy group. Let me try to outline:

1. Add ethoxy group.

But how? Starting with benzene, adding ethoxy via electrophilic substitution. I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by reduction. Here's a possible pathway:

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation with acetyl chloride → acetophenone.

2. Reduce acetophenone to benzyl alcohol (using H2/Ni).

3. Convert benzyl alcohol to benzyl chloride (using SOCl2 or similar).

4. Perform nucleophilic substitution with ethoxide (using NaOH and EtBr?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using a different method.

I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try to summarize:

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro, at positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

The correct sequence should introduce these groups in an order that allows each new group to be directed correctly by the existing groups.

Given that nitro is deactivating, it's best added last. So the sequence would be:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add ethoxy.

3. Add nitro.

Now, how to add ethoxy after tert-butyl.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via an alkoxy group substitution. So, after adding tert-butyl, perhaps the ring has a leaving group which can be replaced by ethoxy.

But how to get a leaving group after adding tert-butyl. Maybe through nitration and reduction.

Wait, perhaps:

1. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Nitrate to add nitro group.

3. Reduce nitro to amine.

4. Diazotize and substitute with ethoxy.

Then, the nitro group is added after ethoxy.

Wait, let me think:

After step 3, the ring has tert-butyl and amine groups.

Then, step 4: nitro group is replaced by ethoxy.

Wait, but that would mean the nitro group is gone. Hmm, that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via substitution after a nitro group is present.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me look at the options again, focusing on which option adds the substituents in the order of tert-butyl, ethoxy, then nitro.

Looking at option D:

i) Nitration → adds nitro.

ii) Reduction → amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → adds tert-butyl.

iv) Nitration again → adds another nitro.

That doesn't fit.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate.

iii) sulfonate → adds sulfonic acid.

iv) NaNO2 → diazotize.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+, H2O → more hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

Hmm, perhaps after steps i and ii, the ring has tert-butyl and nitro.

Then, sulfonate would add another group, which isn't desired.

So perhaps option A isn't correct.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again.

Hmm, again, perhaps not.

Option C steps:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) sulfonate → adds SO3H.

iii) nitrate → adds nitro.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2 → diazotize.

vi) nitrate again.

Hmm, not matching the target.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Let me re-examine option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Now, the ring has amine and tert-butyl.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again. Where would the nitro group go? The amine is activating and ortho/para directing. The tert-butyl is also activating and ortho/para. So the nitro group would be added at a position ortho or para to both.

Wait, but the target has nitro at position 3 relative to ethoxy. Hmm, this might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps after nitration, the ring has three substituents: amine, tert-butyl, and nitro. But the target has nitro, tert-butyl, and ethoxy.

This doesn't seem to fit.

Another angle: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 reaction, replacing a leaving group. For example, if a nitro group is present and is converted into a good leaving group.

Wait, but nitro groups aren't good leaving groups. However, if we reduce the nitro group to an amine, then diazotize to form a diazonium salt, which can be displaced by an ethoxide.

So, the sequence would be:

1. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Nitrate to add nitro.

3. Reduce nitro to amine.

4. Diazotize amine to form diazonium salt.

5. Substitute with ethoxide to introduce ethoxy group.

6. Nitrate again? No, because the target has only one nitro group.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro group is at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ethoxy group.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add ethoxy group.

2. Add tert-butyl.

3. Add nitro.

But how to add ethoxy first.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after a good leaving group is present.

But I'm not making much progress. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Looking at the options, option D seems to involve adding nitro first, then tert-butyl, and then another nitration, which doesn't match the target. Option C adds sulfonic acid, which is not part of the target. Option B seems to involve adding nitro after tert-butyl and then reducing it, which might not fit.

Option A:

After adding tert-butyl and nitro, sulfonate, which is not part of the target. So perhaps this isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

But looking at the options, which one does that?

Looking at option D:

iii) Friedel-Crafts adds tert-butyl after nitration and reduction.

So, the steps in D are:

i) Nitrate → nitro group.

ii) Reduce → amine.

iii) Alkylation → tert-butyl.

iv) Nitrate again → another nitro.

Hmm, that would have two nitro groups, which isn't what we want.

Wait, another option is that the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after the ring has a nitro group. For example, if the nitro group is converted to a diazonium salt, which is then replaced by ethoxy.

So the steps would be:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Diazotize → diazonium salt.

4. Substitute with ethoxide → ethoxybenzene.

5. Then, add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

But in this case, the ring has ethoxy and tert-butyl. Then, where would the nitro group go?

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added last.

Wait, no, because the nitro group is deactivating, and after Friedel-Crafts, the ring is less reactive.

Hmm, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add ethoxy group via substitution.

2. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

3. Add nitro group via nitration.

But how to add ethoxy first.

Wait, perhaps after nitration and reduction, the ring has an amine, which is then substituted with ethoxy.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is option D.

Wait, let me look again. Option D's steps are:

i) Nitration → nitro group.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → tert-butyl.

iv) Nitration → another nitro.

v) NaNO2 → diazotization.

vi) SO3 → sulfonation.

vii) dilute H2SO4.

viii) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

Hmm, perhaps the steps after substitution would replace a group with ethoxy.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct.

Wait, let me think again. The target has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. The correct order is to add tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Looking for which option starts with tert-butyl, then adds ethoxy, then nitro.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate.

iii) sulfonate.

No, sulfonate is not desired.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce.

iv) nitrate.

Hmm, perhaps not.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) sulfonate → not desired.

No.

Hmm, perhaps none of the options directly follow this order. But perhaps I've missed something.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after the nitro group is present.

If the nitro group is at position 3, then adding ethoxy would need to be directed correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add nitro at position 3.

3. Add ethoxy at position 1.

But how to achieve that.

Wait, after adding tert-butyl, nitrating would add nitro either ortho or para to tert-butyl.

Suppose after adding tert-butyl at position 2, nitrating would add nitro at position 3 (ortho) or position 5 (meta). Wait, but ortho to tert-butyl at position 2 would be positions 1 and 3.

So, if we nitrate after adding tert-butyl, the nitro group would be at position 3 (ortho to tert-butyl at 2). Then, adding ethoxy would need to be at position 1, which is ortho to tert-butyl.

But the ethoxy group is an activating group. So, after adding tert-butyl and nitro, can we add the ethoxy group?

Wait, but the nitro group is deactivating, so the ring would be less reactive, making electrophilic substitution harder. So, perhaps adding ethoxy after nitro would be challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution reaction, replacing the nitro group. But that would require the nitro group to be a good leaving group, which it isn't. So perhaps it's not.

Hmm, given all this, I think the correct option is option D.

Wait, no, I'm not convinced. Maybe I should look for the order where tert-butyl is added first, then nitro, then ethoxy via substitution.

Wait, but in option D, the steps after adding nitro and reducing involve adding tert-butyl, which would be possible because the amine is activating. Then, they nitrate again, which might not be correct.

I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the steps in the options. The correct sequence should involve adding tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Looking at the options, only option D starts with nitration, which might not be correct. Option A starts with tert-butyl, then nitrates, which could work, but then it sulfonates, which isn't desired. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D. Because after adding nitro, then tert-butyl, and then another nitration, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct. Let me read option C again:

Option C:

i) Friedel-Crafts → tert-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce.

v) NaNO2 → diazotize.

vi) HNO3 → nitrate again.

Hmm, this doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct sequence must add the tert-butyl and ethoxy groups before the nitro group, as adding nitro last would be difficult due to deactivation.

So, the correct order is:

1. tert-butyl (Friedel-Crafts).

2. ethoxy (some method).

3. nitro (nitration).

Looking at the options, which option does this?

None of the options directly do this. But perhaps in option D, the steps are:

i) nitrate → nitro.

ii) reduce → amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → tert-butyl.

iv) nitrate → another nitro.

But this would have two nitro groups, which isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via substitution after the nitro group is converted into a diazonium salt.

So, the steps would be:

i) nitrate → nitro.

ii) reduce → amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → tert-butyl.

iv) nitrate → another nitro.

Wait, but that's too many nitro groups.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is option D, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, another approach: the target has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. The correct order is to add the ethoxy and tert-butyl first, then nitro.

Looking for which option adds these in that order.

Option D adds nitro first, then tert-butyl, which might not be optimal.

Option A adds tert-butyl, then nitro, then sulfonate, which isn't part of the target.

Option B adds tert-butyl, then nitro, then reduces, which might not fit.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Wait, but I'm running out of time. I think the correct answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the key is to determine the correct sequence of reactions that introduces the substituents—tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro—in an order that ensures each substitution is directed appropriately by the existing groups. The tert-butyl and ethoxy groups are activating and ortho/para-directing, while the nitro group is deactivating and meta-directing. Adding the nitro group last is advantageous because it avoids deactivating the ring prematurely, making subsequent substitutions difficult.

### Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds the tert-butyl group.
2. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration adds the nitro group.
3. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is not part of the target molecule.
4. Subsequent steps (NaNO₂/HCl, dilute H₂SO₄, H₃O⁺/H₂O/Heat, Fe/HCl, HNO₃/H₂SO₄) do not align with the desired product.  
**Conclusion**: Incorrect due to the introduction of an unwanted sulfonic acid group.

#### **Option B**:
1. **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds the tert-butyl group.
2. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration adds the nitro group.
3. **Fe/HCl**: Reduction converts the nitro group to an amine.
4. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration adds another nitro group.
5. Subsequent steps (NaNO₂/HCl, dilute H₂SO₄, H₃O⁺/H₂O/Heat, NaOH/EtBr) do not lead to the correct product.  
**Conclusion**: Incorrect due to the addition of multiple nitro groups and mismatched substituent positions.

#### **Option C**:
1. **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds the tert-butyl group.
2. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is not part of the target molecule.
3. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration adds the nitro group.
4. Subsequent steps (Fe/HCl, NaNO₂/HCl, HNO₃/H₂SO₄, H₃O⁺/H₂O/Heat, NaOH/EtBr) do not align with the desired product.  
**Conclusion**: Incorrect due to the introduction of an unwanted sulfonic acid group.

#### **Option D**:
1. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration adds the nitro group.
2. **Fe/HCl**: Reduction converts the nitro group to an amine.
3. **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds the tert-butyl group.
4. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration adds another nitro group.
5. Subsequent steps (NaNO₂/HCl, SO₃/H₂SO₄, dilute H₂SO₄, H₃O⁺/H₂O/Heat, NaOH/EtBr) do not lead to the correct product.  
**Conclusion**: Incorrect due to the addition of multiple nitro groups and mismatched substituent positions.

### Final Answer:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences perfectly match the desired product. However, **Option D** is the closest, as it involves key steps like nitration, reduction, and Friedel-Crafts alkylation, which are relevant to the synthesis. Despite its flaws, it aligns most closely with the required transformations.
