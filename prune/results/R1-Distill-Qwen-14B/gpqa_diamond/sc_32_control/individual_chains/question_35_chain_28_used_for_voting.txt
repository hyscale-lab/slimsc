Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says that A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, Ay, which is equal to c multiplied by S. The constant c is h divided by 4π. Oh wait, and S has specific entries. The first row is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). 

I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are related to Pauli matrices. Oh right, because for spin-½ particles, the spin matrices are related to the Pauli matrices multiplied by some constants. Wait, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Each of them is a 2x2 matrix with specific forms.

So the S matrix here looks familiar. Let me write it out. S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Wait, if I compare that to the Pauli matrices, σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is σy. So S = σy.

And the operator A_y is c * S, which is c * σy. Since c is h/(4π), that would make A_y = (h/(4π)) * σy.

Wait, but the eigenvalue equation is A_y φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue. So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y.

Eigenvalues for a 2x2 matrix can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0.

But wait, since A_y is proportional to σy, which is a Pauli matrix, I recall that the eigenvalues of σy are ±i. Because Pauli matrices have eigenvalues of ±1 for each, but wait no, each Pauli matrix squared gives I, so their eigenvalues are ±1. Wait wait, actually, Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but when you have a matrix like iσy, the eigenvalues become ±i.

Wait, let me think. σy is a Hermitian matrix, right? Because all Pauli matrices are Hermitian. So σy has real eigenvalues. The eigenvalues are ±1 because (σy)^2 = I, so the eigenvalues squared are 1, so they're ±1.

So then A_y = (h/(4π)) * σy.

The eigenvalues of A_y would then be the eigenvalues of σy multiplied by (h/(4π)). So the eigenvalues are (h/(4π)) * (1) and (h/(4π)) * (-1). So a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh, which doesn't fit. Because h/(4π) is real. So option A is talking about imaginary parts, which doesn't make sense because A_y is Hermitian, right? Because S is Hermitian?

Wait, wait, S is σy, which is Hermitian, and c is a real scalar. So c*σy is also Hermitian. So the eigenvalues should be real. So any option that talks about the eigenvalues having imaginary parts must be incorrect because that's impossible for a Hermitian operator. So looking at the options.

Option A: Im(eigenvalue) = ±2πh, real part is ±h/(4π). That's impossible because eigenvalues should be real, so the real parts are ±h/(4π), and imaginary parts are zero. So option A is wrong.

Option B: Im part is ±1/2, real part ±1. That also suggests eigenvalues are complex, which can't be right. So B is out.

Options C and D talk about eigenfunctions. Let me think.

Option C: The eigenfunction of A_y can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Hmm. Well, A is the total angular momentum operator. For spin-½ particles, the square of the angular momentum is (A_x² + A_y² + A_z²) = (ħ^2 s(s+1)), where s=1/2. So A² is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, so any eigenfunction of A² is an eigenvector of A², which is any vector in the space. So if φ is an eigenvector of A_y, then it's also an eigenvector of A² because A² acts as a scalar. So yes, the eigenfunctions of A_y can be eigenfunctions of A².

But what about Az? Well, A_y and A_z don't commute because [A_y, A_z] = iħ A_x (from angular momentum commutation relations). So if φ is an eigenfunction of A_y, it can't be an eigenfunction of A_z unless A_y and A_z commute, which they don't. So option C is correct in that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. So C is a possible correct option.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, not sure. I think the basis functions are the eigenvectors. So, the eigenvectors form a basis. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions? Wait, the operator Ay is 2x2, so there are two eigenfunctions, which are orthogonal. So yes, the eigenvectors are a basis for the space. So D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. That sounds true because the eigenvectors form a basis.

Wait, but let me think about what the question is asking. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So are either C or D correct?

Wait, let's go back to the eigenvalues. Oh, I thought the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). But wait, because S is σy, so A_y = c σy, with c = h/(4π). So the eigenvalues of A_y would be ± (h/(4π)) * 1. So ± h/(4π). But wait, wait. Let me double-check.

Wait, the eigenvalues of σy are ±1. So when multiplied by c = h/(4π), they become ± h/(4π). So the real parts are these values, and the imaginary parts are zero. So looking back at the options, none of the options A or B are correct because they talk about imaginary parts as non-zero.

So looking at C and D.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Since A² is a scalar multiple of identity, every vector is an eigenvector, so any eigenfunction of A_y is also an eigenfunction of A². So yes, that's correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Well, since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. So D could be correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So which of these is a correct statement.

So, in the process of calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the statements are about properties that hold during the calculation.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, the matrix operator is 2x2, so its eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct in that statement.

But wait, the question is which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct options are either C or D.

But let's think about the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Since A² is a scalar multiple of identity, any vector is an eigenfunction of A². So yes, correct.

But option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. That's also correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

Wait, but when you have a matrix, any matrix, the eigenvectors (if they form a basis) span the space. So D is correct because the eigenfunctions are the basis.

But wait, the problem is asking which statement is correct during the calculation.

So both C and D could be correct, but looking at the options, the correct answer is likely C or D.

Wait, let's check the options again.

Option C says the eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of Az.

That's correct because, for a spin-½ system, A² is s(s+1)ħ², which is scalar, so any eigenvector of Ay is also an eigenvector of A². But they are not eigenvectors of Az because Ay and Az do not commute.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

Wait, but the options are mutually exclusive. So which one is the correct statement?

The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct statement is either C or D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because the basis functions are the eigenvectors. So D is correct.

Wait, but another thought: the question says that the operator is 2x2, so the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis. So yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions.

Therefore, D is correct.

Wait, but wait, the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. Let me think about each option again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

Yes, because A² is a scalar multiple of identity. So any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Yes, because the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

But wait, the question is multiple-choice, so only one option can be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, the correct answer is probably C.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of A_y are ±h/(4π).

So for the options, none of A or B are correct because their eigenvalues are complex or have different values.

So the correct answer is either C or D.

Now, let's evaluate the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Also correct.

Wait, but the question says which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both are correct, but the options may have only one correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is C because D is a general statement, but let's think about it.

Wait, let's think about the matrix S.

S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is σy.

So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

The eigenvalues of σy are ±1, so the eigenvalues of Ay are ± h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues a are ± h/(4π).

Now, looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). Which can't be right because the eigenvalues are real.

So A is wrong.

Option B: Im parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Also incorrect, because eigenvalues are real.

So the real parts are ±h/(4π), so what about the options?

Looking back, the correct eigenvalues are real, so the eigenfunctions are real or complex but the eigenvalues are real.

So the correct statements are in options C and D.

Now, the question is which statement is correct.

Which of the options is correct.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Since A² is a scalar, any function is an eigenfunction of A². So any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². So C is correct.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Which is true because the eigenvectors form a basis.

So both C and D seem correct, but perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but looking at the options, the correct eigenvalues are real, so during the calculation, you would find that the eigenvalues are real, so any statements about their imaginary parts can be dismissed.

So the only correct statements are C and D.

Wait, but the question provides four options, and only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. That is, when you diagonalize the operator, the eigenvectors form the basis.

So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but I thought option C was also correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C because the problem is about which statement is correct during the calculation, and the calculation would show that the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A².

Alternatively, perhaps both C and D are correct, but only one is an option.

Wait, the question states which statement is correct. So I have to choose between C and D.

Another angle: the operator Ay is part of the angular momentum operators. The total angular momentum J is related to spin.

Wait, for spin-½ particles, the square of the angular momentum is (s(s+1))ħ², where s=1/2. So J² = (3/4)ħ². So A² would be part of J². Wait, but in this question, A is the intrinsic angular momentum operator, so maybe A² would be (s(s+1))ħ². But that's a different matter.

But for the operator A_y, its eigenfunctions are not eigenfunctions of A_z because of the angular momentum commutation relations.

So, during the calculation, you would find that the eigenfunctions of A_y cannot be eigenfunctions of A_z, but they can be eigenfunctions of A². So option C is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is C.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that during the calculation, which statement is correct.

So I think the correct answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the correct statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix given by:

\[
S = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Matrix \( S \) and Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( S \) is identified as the Pauli \( \sigma_y \) matrix, which is Hermitian. The eigenvalues of \( \sigma_y \) are \( \pm 1 \).
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c \), which are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). These eigenvalues are real because \( A_y \) is Hermitian.

2. **Option A and B:**
   - Option A suggests the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \), and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are purely real.
   - Option B suggests the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \), and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

3. **Option C:**
   - The statement claims that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). 
   - \( A^2 \) is the square of the total angular momentum operator, which is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix for spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) particles. Thus, any eigenfunction of \( A_y \) is also an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \). 
   - However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) cannot generally be eigenfunctions of \( A_z \). This makes Option C correct.

4. **Option D:**
   - The statement claims that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). 
   - For a 2×2 matrix, the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. Thus, this statement is true. However, Option C provides a more specific and relevant insight about the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), making it the better choice.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This aligns with the commutation relations and properties of angular momentum operators.
