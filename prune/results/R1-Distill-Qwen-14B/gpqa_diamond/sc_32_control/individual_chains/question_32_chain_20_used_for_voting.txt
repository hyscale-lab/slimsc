Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is Lithium, right? So, Lithium-6 would have 3 neutrons because Li typically has atomic number 3, so 3 protons and 3 neutrons makes Li-6. So the nucleus here is a Li-6 ion.

I remember that in particle physics, the energy of a particle depends on its mass and velocity. Since it's a heavy ion, I think I need to use the relativistic energy equations. The question gives the speed as 0.96c, which is pretty high, so I can't just use classical mechanics. Relativistic effects will definitely come into play here.

So, the first thing I need to find is the total energy of the nucleus. The total relativistic energy of a particle is given by E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is calculated as 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I'll need to compute gamma for v = 0.96c.

Let me calculate gamma first. Let's plug in v = 0.96c:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)
Let me compute 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Then the square root of 0.0784 is... wait, what's the square root of 0.0784? Hmm, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

So gamma becomes 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714… Wait, wait, 0.28 times 3.5714 is around 1, right? So gamma is about 3.5714.

But I should be precise here. Let me calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 0.28 squared is indeed 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857... Approximately 3.5714.

So gamma is about 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons. Each proton is about 1.007276 GeV/c², and each neutron is about 1.008665 GeV/c².

Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, the mass of a proton is approximately 938 MeV/c², right? So wait, 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So 938 MeV is 0.938 GeV.

Wait, but wait, the exact mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², which is 0.938272 GeV/c². Similarly, the neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c², so 0.939565 GeV/c².

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the total rest mass is 3*(proton mass + neutron mass) divided by c², but since we're dealing with energy, we'll multiply by c² later.

Wait, but actually, the rest mass energy of the nucleus is m0c² = (mass of nucleus) * c². So the mass of the nucleus is the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons.

So, m0 = 3*(m_p + m_n) ?

Wait, wait. Wait, no, it's 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So m0 = 3*m_p + 3*m_n.

Wait, but isn't that the case? Each proton is 3 times, each neutron is 3 times. So m0 = 3*(m_p + m_n). Let me compute that.

m_p = 0.938272 GeV/c²
m_n = 0.939565 GeV/c²

So each m_p + m_n is 0.938272 + 0.939565 = 1.877837 GeV/c².

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Wait, the nucleus is made of 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so m0 is 3*(m_p) + 3*(m_n).

So that's 3*(0.938272) + 3*(0.939565) = 3*(0.938272 + 0.939565) = 3*(1.877837) = ?

1.877837 * 3 = 5.633511 GeV/c².

Wait, that seems a bit high. Wait, wait, no, because each proton is about 1 GeV, so 3 would be 3 GeV, but here I'm getting around 5.6 GeV. Wait that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm mixing up units perhaps. Wait, no, the mass of a proton is about 0.938 GeV/c². So 3 protons would be 2.814 GeV/c², same for 3 neutrons. So 3*(proton + neutron) is 3*(0.938+0.939565)= 3*(1.877565) = 5.6327 GeV/c². So that's correct.

So m0c² would be 5.6327 GeV. Because m0 is in GeV/c², multiplying by c² gives GeV.

So the rest energy is 5.6327 GeV.

Now, the total energy E is gamma * m0 c². So E = gamma * m0c².

Gamma was calculated as approximately 3.5714.

So E = 3.5714 * 5.6327 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 * 5.6327.

Hmm, let me compute 3.5 * 5.6327 is about 19.71445. Then 0.0714 * 5.6327 is approximately 0.404. So total around 20.118 GeV.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should be more precise.

Alternatively, let's compute 3.5714 * 5.6327.

Let me compute the exact multiplication.

5.6327 × 3.5714.

Let me break it down:

5.6327 × 3 = 16.8981
5.6327 × 0.5 = 2.81635
5.6327 × 0.07 = 0.394289
5.6327 × 0.0014 = 0.00788578

Adding them together:

16.8981 + 2.81635 = 19.71445
19.71445 + 0.394289 = 20.108739
20.108739 + 0.00788578 ≈ 20.1166

So approximately 20.1166 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close but a bit higher. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of m0.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the mass computation.

Wait, each proton is 0.938272 GeV/c², each neutron is 0.939565 GeV/c².

3 protons and 3 neutrons: 3*(0.938272 + 0.939565) = 3*(1.877837) = 5.633511 GeV/c².

So m0c² is 5.633511 GeV.

Then gamma is 3.57142857.

So E = 3.57142857 * 5.633511.

Let me compute that more accurately.

Hmm, 3.57142857 ≈ 25/7, since 25 ÷7 is approximately 3.57142857.

So 25/7 * 5.633511.

Compute 5.633511 * 25 = 140.837775.

Then divide by 7: 140.837775 /7 = approximately 20.11968 GeV.

So around 20.1197 GeV.

Wait, the options are given with four decimal places, but the options don't have that exact number. Let's look at the options:

Option C: 20.132
Option D: 21.419 (but no decimal places, which is probably a typo, but probably meant 21.419 GeV)

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, let me recompute gamma more precisely.

v = 0.96c

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) 

Compute 0.96^2 = 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

But wait, perhaps the calculation of m0 is incorrect. Maybe I should use the mass of lithium-6 nucleus in atomic mass units (u) and convert to GeV.

Wait, yes, perhaps it's better to compute the exact mass of Li-6. Because in reality, when you sum the masses of protons and neutrons, you get a value that's higher than the actual nucleus mass due to binding energy. Wait, but wait! Wait, in reality, the mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of its nucleons because of the mass defect due to binding energy. But wait, in this problem, are we supposed to approximate the mass as the sum of individual nucleons, or should we use the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus?

Hmm, the question says, "X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons." So it's referring to a Li-6 nucleus, which is 3 protons and 3 neutrons. But wait, in reality, the mass of Li-6 is known. Let me check the exact mass.

Wait, I don't remember the exact value, but perhaps I can compute it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to treat the nucleus as a free particle without considering binding energy, just using the sum of the individual masses.

Alternatively, perhaps using the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus in MeV/c².

Wait, searching in my memory, I think that the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 10.8113 u. Wait, wait, no, the mass of a Li-6 atom is about 10.8113 u, but that includes electrons. Wait, but the nucleus is just protons and neutrons, so the atomic mass minus the electrons.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 10.8113 u. Each Li atom has 3 electrons, so the nuclear mass would be approximately 10.8113 u minus 3*(electron mass). The electron mass is about 0.00054858 u each. So 3 * 0.00054858 ≈ 0.0016457 u.

So nuclear mass ≈ 10.8113 - 0.0016457 ≈ 10.80965 u.

But wait, more accurately, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately 10.80965 u.

Now, 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 10.80965 u * 931.5 MeV/c²/u = ?

10.80965 * 931.5 ≈ Let me compute this.

First, 10 * 931.5 = 9315 MeV.

0.80965 * 931.5 ≈ 0.8 * 931.5 is 745.2; 0.00965 * 931.5 ≈ 9.0 (approximately 9.0).

So 745.2 + 9.0 ≈ 754.2 MeV.

So total is 9315 + 754.2 = 10069.2 MeV, which is about 10.0692 GeV.

Wait, wait, that's approximately 10.0692 GeV.

Wait, but earlier when I summed the protons and neutrons, I got around 5.6335 GeV. But when using the exact nuclear mass, it's about 10 GeV. Hmmm, that's a big discrepancy.

Wait, that indicates that I made a mistake earlier. Because the actual nuclear mass is about 10 GeV/c², not 5.6 GeV as I thought earlier. Because when you sum protons and neutrons naively, you get a higher mass, but in reality, the binding energy reduces the mass.

Wait, but in the problem statement, perhaps I'm supposed to assume that the nucleus is a free particle, and just sum the individual masses of the protons and neutrons.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass of the light nucleus as approximately 6 times the mass of a proton, but that's not correct because a proton is about 1 GeV, and 6 would be 6 GeV, but the actual is about 10 GeV.

Wait, this suggests that my initial approach was incorrect. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, another approach: The mass of Li-6 isotope.

The exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 10.80965 u as I found earlier. So 10.80965 u * (931.5 MeV/c²/u) = 10.80965 * 931.5 MeV.

Calculating 10 *931.5=9315 MeV.

0.80965 *931.5 = let's compute this.

0.8 *931.5 = 745.2 MeV.

0.00965 *931.5 ≈ ≈ 9.0 MeV.

So total 745.2 +9.0=754.2 MeV.

Adding to 9315, we get 9315 +754.2= 10069.2 MeV, which is 10.0692 GeV.

So m0c² is 10.0692 GeV.

Wait, so previously I was wrong because I didn't account for the binding energy, which reduces the mass. So now, the correct m0c² is approximately 10.0692 GeV.

So back to the calculation.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E = gamma * m0c² = 3.57142857 * 10.0692 GeV.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *10 = 35.7142857

3.57142857 *0.0692 ≈ let's compute:

0.0692 *3.57142857 ≈ 0.2475 GeV.

So total E ≈ 35.7142857 + 0.2475 ≈ 35.96178 GeV.

Wait, that's around 35.96 GeV.

But looking at the options, the highest option is 23 GeV (option B). So that can't be right. Hmm, something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up units. Let me double-check.

Wait, 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c². So 10.80965 u is 10.80965 *931.5 MeV = 10.80965 *0.9315 GeV = ?

Wait, wait, 931.5 MeV is 0.9315 GeV. So 10.80965 u is 10.80965 *0.9315 GeV.

Wait, 10 *0.9315=9.315 GeV.

0.80965 *0.9315≈ 0.754 GeV.

Total is approximately 10.069 GeV, which matches the earlier calculation.

So m0c² is 10.069 GeV. Gamma is 3.5714.

So E = 3.5714 *10.069.

Compute 3.5714 *10=35.714,

3.5714 *0.069= approx 0.246.

So E=35.714+0.246= 35.96 GeV.

But looking at the options, the highest is 23 GeV. So that's way off. That means I must have made a mistake in the mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the mass of the atom with the nucleus. Because the mass of Li-6 is 10.8113 u, but that's the atomic mass, including electrons. The nuclear mass is less because the electrons have lower mass.

Ah, that's my mistake. So if the atomic mass is 10.8113 u, and each Li atom has 3 electrons, each of about 0.00054858 u, then the nuclear mass is 10.8113 - 3*(0.00054858) = 10.8113 - 0.0016457 = 10.80965 u.

Wait, but that's the nuclear mass. So that's correct.

Wait, so the nuclear mass is 10.80965 u. So m0c² is 10.80965 * 931.5 MeV/c² = 10.069 GeV.

Hmm, but the calculated energy would then be around 35.96 GeV, which is way higher than any of the options. So clearly, I must be making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial approach. Oh wait! Wait a minute. Wait, the problem states that the speed is 0.96c, and we're looking for the energy of the RHIC. But RHIC accelerates heavy ions like gold, but in this case, it's Li-6.

But wait, in colliders, the energy is usually given per nucleus. So the energy I'm calculating is the total energy, but perhaps the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Oh! Oh, that might be it.

Wait, the question says: "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?"

But wait, in particle accelerators, the energy given is often the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. So perhaps I'm miscalculating because I assumed the total energy, but the question is about kinetic energy.

Wait, but the problem says "energy of the RHIC", which is likely the kinetic energy imparted to the ion.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it's the energy of the collider, which likely refers to the kinetic energy, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

In particle physics, the total energy of the particle is gamma * m0 c², which includes rest mass energy. The kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) * m0 c².

So, if the problem is asking for the energy of the collider, which is the kinetic energy, then I need to compute (gamma -1) * m0 c².

So, let's recalculate.

Gamma is 3.5714, m0c² is 10.069 GeV.

So, total energy E = gamma * m0c² = 3.5714 *10.069 ≈ 35.96 GeV.

Kinetic energy K = E - m0c² = 35.96 - 10.069 ≈ 25.891 GeV.

Hmm, none of the options are near 25.89 GeV. The options are up to 23 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I'm still making a mistake in the mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps the mass is calculated using the sum of the masses of the individual nucleons, not considering binding energy. So let's try that.

So, each proton is about 0.938 GeV/c², each neutron about 0.939565 GeV/c².

3 protons: 3 * 0.938 = 2.814 GeV/c².

3 neutrons: 3 *0.939565 = 2.818695 GeV/c².

Total m0 = 2.814 +2.818695 =5.632695 GeV/c².

m0c² =5.632695 GeV.

Now, gamma is 3.5714.

E = gamma * m0c² =3.5714 *5.632695 ≈?

Let me compute 3.5714 *5 =17.857.

3.5714 *0.632695 ≈ let's compute.

0.6 *3.5714≈2.1428.

0.032695 *3.5714≈0.1167.

So 2.1428 +0.1167≈2.2595.

So total E≈17.857 +2.2595=20.1165 GeV.

So E is approximately 20.1165 GeV.

But wait, the problem is about the energy of the RHIC. That energy is the kinetic energy, perhaps. So K= E - m0c² =20.1165 -5.632695=14.4838 GeV.

But the options don't have 14.48 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total energy, which is 20.1165 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

Wait, but in this scenario, when we used the sum of individual nucleon masses, we got 20.1165 GeV. So the correct answer would be around 20.116 GeV, which is option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, but why when using the nuclear mass (including binding energy) I got 35.96 GeV, which is way higher than the options. So perhaps the problem expects us to use the sum of individual nucleon masses, not considering the binding energy.

So the correct calculation is using m0 as 5.6327 GeV/c², leading to E=20.116 GeV, which rounds to option C:20.132 GeV.

So the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy equations. The total relativistic energy of a particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m_0 \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy \( m_0 c^2 \)
The nucleus is Li-6, which consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using the approximate rest masses of a proton (\( m_p \approx 0.938272 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \)) and a neutron (\( m_n \approx 0.939565 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \)):

\[
m_0 = 3m_p + 3m_n = 3(0.938272) + 3(0.939565) = 5.6327 \, \text{GeV}/c^2
\]

Thus, the rest energy is:

\[
m_0 c^2 = 5.6327 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Compute the total energy \( E \)
Substituting \( \gamma \approx 3.5714 \) and \( m_0 c^2 = 5.6327 \, \text{GeV} \) into the energy equation:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.6327 \approx 20.116 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The calculated energy (\( \approx 20.116 \, \text{GeV} \)) is closest to option **C) 20.132 GeV**. The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding differences in intermediate steps.

### Final Answer:
The energy of the RHIC is approximately **20.132 GeV**.

Answer: C
