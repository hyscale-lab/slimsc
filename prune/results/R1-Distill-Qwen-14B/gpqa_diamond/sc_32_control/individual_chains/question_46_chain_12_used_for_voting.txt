Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this Grubbs catalyst problem. Hmm, let me start by recalling what Grubbs catalyst does. I remember that Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis usually involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. So, when Grubbs is used, it can cause olefin metathesis, like breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds.

The compound given is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers, right? But since it's the same molecule, maybe the configuration doesn't affect the metathesis outcome? Or perhaps it does because the structure might have different possible sites for the reaction.

Let me draw the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₂. But wait, 3-methyl would put a methyl branch on the third carbon. So, 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH₂CH3? No, wait, let me count. The formula should be CH₂=CHCH(CH3)CH₂CH3? Wait no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene has five carbons with the double bond starting at C1. So, the structure is CH₂=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, that's 1-pentene, but if it's 3-methyl, then the third carbon has a methyl group.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, wait, that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the third carbon (C3) has a methyl group attached.

Now, when Grubbs catalyst is used, this molecule undergoes ring-closing metathesis if possible, or maybe cross metathesis if there's another alkene present. But since the question mentions racemic, perhaps it's a diastereomer, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but Grubbs can also cause ring-opening metathesis if applicable, but in this case, it's an open chain, so maybe ring-closing. Alternatively, it might just undergo cross metathesis, but since it's the same molecule, perhaps it can form rings.

Wait, another thought: in ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst would facilitate the formation of a ring by breaking and reforming the double bonds. So, with 3-methylpent-1-ene, can it form a ring?

Let me think: the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, the double bond is between 1 and 2. The chain is five carbons long, with a methyl branch on C3.

If we close the ring, how many carbons would form the ring? The double bonds would be broken and reconnected. So, maybe the double bond can form between C2 and C3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible products. Grubbs catalyst can cause olefin metathesis, so the initial double bond can break, and the ends can swap partners.

But wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene has one double bond. So when Grubbs is added, it can undergo ring-closing metathesis if possible, or other types.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of ring-opening metathesis, but the molecule isn't cyclic to start with, so that's not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can form a ring via metathesis. Let's think: the double bond is at C1-C2. So, the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. To form a ring, perhaps the catalyst could connect the CH₂ groups. For example, maybe the CH₂ from the end (C5) can connect with the CH₂ after the double bond (C2), forming a ring.

So, let's imagine that. If the catalyst breaks the C1-C2 double bond, and then reconnects the ends in a way that forms a ring.

The molecule has 5 carbons, so if it forms a 5-membered ring, that would require a 4-carbon bridge, but I'm not sure. Let's count the positions.

Wait, another approach: in ring-closing metathesis, the two ends of the molecule must be connected via the catalyst. So, for 3-methylpent-1-ene, the ends are the CH₂=CH- and the CH₂CH3. Wait, perhaps the catalyst can take the CH₂ from the end and connect it to another part.

Alternatively, perhaps it's more about breaking the double bond and forming new ones. Alternatively, maybe the double bond can shift positions, leading to different alkenes.

Wait, another thought: Grubbs can cause isomerization of the double bond. So, the initial structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3. If the double bond shifts, where can it go?

But wait, the molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. The double bond is at 1-2. Could it shift to 2-3, making 2-methylpent-1-ene? Or maybe other positions.

Wait, but the molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene, so the double bond is at the first position. The possible sites for metathesis could be the ends of the double bond. So, the catalyst could break the double bond and form new ones.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo cross metathesis, but without another alkene, maybe it can only do ring-closing.

Wait, but without another molecule, perhaps the same molecule can undergo ring-closing. Let me see: the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. So, the ends are CH₂ and CH3. Let me number the carbons: 1 2 3 4 5.

Carbon 1: CH₂=
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: CH(CH3)
Carbon 4: CH₂
Carbon 5: CH3

So, the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3.

If the catalyst causes the CH₂ from carbon 1 and the CH3 from carbon 5 to swap partners, perhaps forming a ring.

Wait, to form a ring, the catalyst would need to connect the two ends. So, the double bond breaks, and the two ends (CH₂ and CH3) are connected.

Wait, maybe the metathesis would form a new double bond. So, perhaps the new structure would be a ring with a double bond.

Let me imagine: the CH₂ from carbon 1 and the CH2 from carbon 4 or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 from carbon 1 could connect to carbon 4, making a ring. Let me see the possible ring sizes.

If we connect carbon 1 to carbon 4, the ring would be a 4-membered ring? Let me see: 1-2-3-4-1. Oh wait, no, if we break the double bond between 1 and 2, and then connect 1 to 4, that would form a 4-membered ring. Alternatively, connecting 1 to 5 would make a 5-membered ring.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of the possible rings that can form.

The molecule has five carbons in a row. If the double bond is at 1-2, and the catalyst causes the ends (carbon 1 and carbon 5) to swap, perhaps forming a ring.

Wait, perhaps the CH₂ from carbon 1 (CH₂=) could transfer to carbon 5, and the CH3 from carbon 5 could transfer to carbon 2. Then, the double bonds would form between the new connections.

So, the new arrangement could be a ring: the structure would be a cycloalkene.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure about the specifics. Let me try to imagine the process.

In Grubbs metathesis, the catalyst (a transition metal complex) binds to the olefin (double bond) and breaks it, creating metal-carbon bonds. Then, the ends can interchange, leading to new double bonds.

In this case, the two ends of the double bond are CH2 and CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's the structure: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, the two ends are the CH2 group (from C1) and the CH- group (from C2).

But if the catalyst breaks the double bond, perhaps the two ends can swap. So, the CH2 and the CH can connect to different parts.

Wait, but without another molecule, perhaps the same molecule can form a ring by connecting the two ends.

So, the possible products would be cyclic alkenes. Let me think about the possible ring sizes.

If the CH2 from C1 connects to the CH2 from C5, what ring would that form?

Wait, let me count the number of carbons between them. From C1 to C5 in the original chain is four carbons apart. So, connecting C1 and C5 would form a 5-membered ring (since 5 carbons in the ring). Alternatively, maybe a four-membered ring if connected to a different point.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possible ring sizes. The molecule is five carbons long, so possible rings are 3, 4, or 5-membered.

Wait, but with the current structure, perhaps only specific ring sizes are possible.

Alternatively, maybe the metathesis can break the double bond and form new double bonds at different positions, leading to different alkenes.

Wait, but the question is about the number of possible products, excluding ethene. So, when Grubbs is used, it could lead to different products depending on where the metathesis occurs.

Another angle: racemic mixture. Since the starting material is racemic, could the configuration of the substituents affect the products? Hmm, perhaps, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a racemic mixture, but the molecule itself is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So, the molecule has a double bond and a methyl group. Wait, but 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the structure CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. So, the molecule is symmetrical around the double bond? No, because the substituents on either side of the double bond are different.

Wait, the left side of the double bond (C1) is CH₂- and the right side (C2) is CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. So, the two ends are different, meaning the molecule isn't symmetrical. So, if the catalyst breaks the double bond and swaps the ends, the products would depend on where the connections are made.

But since the starting material is racemic, perhaps that introduces more possibilities. Wait, but if the molecule isn't symmetrical, then each enantiomer would react the same way, because the catalyst doesn't differentiate based on configuration in this case. So the racemic status might not affect the product count.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible products of the metathesis.

Grubbs can cause the olefin to undergo ring-closing metathesis. So, in this case, with 3-methylpent-1-ene, the possible rings formed could be 4-membered or 5-membered, depending on where the ends connect.

Wait, how?

The molecule has the structure:

1: CH₂=
2: CH-
3: CH(CH3)
4: CH₂
5: CH3

So, the chain is 1-2-3-4-5.

If the catalyst connects 1 to 3, that would form a ring? Or perhaps 1 to 4 or 5.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis can connect different ends. For example:

Option 1: Connect 1 to 3.

But wait, the molecule is 1-2-3-4-5. To form a ring, we need to connect two ends. Let's see:

If the catalyst breaks the 1-2 double bond and then connects 1 to 5, that would form a 5-membered ring. Alternatively, connecting 1 to 4 would form a 4-membered ring.

Wait, let's count again. The chain is 1-2-3-4-5. If the catalyst connects 1 to 5, the ring would include carbons 1,2,3,4,5— that's a 5-membered ring. So the ring would be cyclopentene with substituents.

Wait, but in the process, the double bonds would shift. Let me think: when the double bond breaks, the catalyst forms new bonds. So, perhaps the new double bond forms between 5 and 1, making a ring.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis would produce a cyclic alkene. So, for 5-membered ring, the new structure would be cyclopentene with substituents.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the structure. Let me try to imagine it.

If the original molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3, and the catalyst connects the CH₂ from C1 to the CH3 from C5, the new molecule would have a ring. For a 5-membered ring, the structure would be a cyclopentene with substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring could be smaller. For example, if the connection is between C1 and C4, that would form a 4-membered ring, but 4-membered rings are less likely due to ring strain. But maybe it's possible.

Wait, but let me think about possible products. Each metathesis event could lead to different ring sizes. So, for 3-methylpent-1-ene, the possible rings formed could be 5-membered and maybe 4-membered.

Wait, but the question asks for possible products excluding ethene. So, the products would be the cyclic compounds formed.

Wait, but wait. Another point: the molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents are CH2 (C1), CH- (C2), CH(CH3) (C3), CH2 (C4), and CH3 (C5).

If the catalyst causes the ends of the double bond (C1 and C2) to reconnect in a way that forms a ring, perhaps the product would be a cycloalkene.

But how many different rings can form? Let me think about the connectivity.

Option 1: The double bond is broken, and the catalyst forms a bond between C1 and C4.

So, the new structure would be a ring where C1 is connected to C4, making a 4-membered ring. But the substituents would be:

C1: CH2 (originally), connected to C4 (CH2). So, the ring would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2, but wait, that might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the new ring would have four members: C1, C2, C3, C4.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis could occur in two different ways, leading to different products.

Wait, perhaps there are two possible rings that can form: a 5-membered and a 4-membered. But I'm not sure if the 4-membered is possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo more than one metathesis event, leading to different products.

Wait, another approach: the number of possible products depends on the number of different ways the double bond can be broken and reconnected.

In this molecule, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The catalyst can break this and form new double bonds between different pairs.

So, the possible new double bonds could be between C1 and C4, C1 and C5, C2 and C4, C2 and C5, etc.

Wait, but I'm not exactly certain. Maybe I should consider the possible sites for the new double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of possible products is determined by the number of possible rings that can form, plus any other possible alkenes from shifting.

Wait, but without another alkene, shifting the double bond would not produce a different product because it's the same molecule.

Wait, no, because the original double bond is at C1-C2. If the catalyst causes the double bond to shift to C2-C3, that would produce 2-methylpent-1-ene or another structure. But I'm not sure if Grubbs would cause a simple shift like that. I think Grubbs typically does metathesis, not simple shifts, unless it's part of a ring-closing.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis can form new alkenes by breaking and recombining the ends.

So, perhaps the possible products are different alkenes formed by connecting various parts of the molecule.

Wait, let's think about the possible products.

Original molecule: CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

If the catalyst breaks the double bond and reconnects the ends in different ways, the possible new alkenes would depend on where the new double bonds form.

For example, one possible product could be the formation of a ring, say, cyclopentene with substituents. Another could be a different alkene with the same number of carbons but in a different position.

Wait, but without another molecule, perhaps the only possible products are the rings formed by connecting different ends.

So, how many different rings can this molecule form?

Option 1: Connect C1 to C5, forming a 5-membered ring. The structure would be cyclopentene with substituents.

But wait, the substituents might vary depending on where the connection is made. Let me think. If C1 is connected to C5, the ring would include C1, C2, C3, C4, C5. That's a 5-membered ring. But what would be the structure?

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond in the ring would be between C5 and C1, making the structure cyclopenta-1,3-diene or something similar. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Another possibility is connecting C1 to C4, forming a 4-membered ring (cyclobutene derivative), but as I thought before, this might be less likely due to ring strain.

Wait, but let's think about the possible products. Each connection would lead to a different ring structure, which would be a different product.

So, for 3-methylpent-1-ene, how many different rings can form?

If the ring can be formed by connecting C1 to C4 or C1 to C5, each leading to a different ring.

Wait, but how many distinct rings would that result in?

If we connect C1 to C4, the ring would have four members (C1, C2, C3, C4). So, that's a four-membered ring. But is that possible? Because the original chain is longer, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, maybe I should count the possible positions where the ring can form.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of possible products is the number of possible distinct rings that can be formed.

Wait, another approach: the molecule has a double bond, and Grubbs can cause it to undergo ring-closing metathesis, which can form a ring. The number of possible rings depends on the possible ways the ends can connect.

In this molecule, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The other end is C5.

Possible connections:

1. C1 to C5: forms a 5-membered ring.
2. C1 to C4: forms a 4-membered ring.
3. C2 to C5: forms a different 4-membered ring.
4. C2 to C4: forms a 3-membered ring, which is unlikely because 3-membered rings are highly strained.

Wait, but 3-membered rings are not typically formed because of the strain, so perhaps only 4 and 5-membered rings are possible.

So, four possibilities? Or perhaps each connection leads to a different structure.

Wait, but each possible ring would have a different substituent arrangement, leading to different products.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. If the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3, and the metathesis connects C1 to C5, the ring would have five members, with substituents on C3 (the methyl group) and perhaps others.

Alternatively, if the metathesis connects C2 to C5, that would form a four-membered ring, with substituents on C3.

But wait, the number of substituents and their positions would affect the structure. So, each connection would lead to a different product.

So, possible rings:

1. 5-membered ring (connecting C1 and C5).
2. 4-membered ring (connecting C1 and C4).
3. 4-membered ring (connecting C2 and C5).

Wait, but connecting C1 to C4 and C2 to C5 would give different ring structures.

Wait, let's count:

- Connecting C1 to C5: 5-membered ring.
- Connecting C1 to C4: 4-membered ring.
- Connecting C2 to C5: 4-membered ring, but perhaps a different structure than C1-C4.

So that's three possible rings. But wait, maybe some of them are the same due to symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps each connection leads to a different product.

But I'm not confident about this approach. Maybe another way to approach it is to count the possible products when the molecule undergoes ring-closing metathesis.

In ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst can connect any two ends of the molecule, provided they're olefinic. But in this case, the molecule has only one double bond.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecule can undergo multiple metathesis events, leading to different products.

But I might be getting stuck here. Let me think about the options given.

The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

So, possible answers are 2,4,6,8.

Now, perhaps the number of possible products is determined by the number of distinct alkenes that can form.

Wait, but the question says to exclude ethene. So, ethene (ethene) is a potential product, but it's excluded, so we don't count it.

Wait, but in this case, the starting molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So, perhaps during metathesis, the catalyst could break off smaller fragments, like ethene, but the question says to exclude that.

So, the possible products would be the larger fragments.

Wait, but in this case, the molecule is a single chain, so breaking the double bond and reconnecting ends would form a ring, not a smaller molecule.

So, the possible products are the rings formed.

So, the number of rings would depend on the possible ways to connect the ends.

So, possible rings: 4-membered and 5-membered. How many distinct structures would each ring have?

Wait, the 5-membered ring could have substituents in different positions, leading to different structures.

Similarly, the 4-membered ring could have substituents leading to different structures.

Wait, but Grubbs catalyst would form the most stable rings, so 5 and 4-membered rings are possible. Let me think about how many distinct products each ring size would produce.

In the case of the 5-membered ring: the ring would have substituents from the original molecule. The original molecule's substituents are the methyl group at C3 and the CH2 and CH3 groups.

So, the 5-membered ring would be a cyclopentene with substituents. How many distinct positions can the substituents take?

Alternatively, perhaps the 5-membered ring can form in two different ways, leading to two different products.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think. If the ring is formed by connecting C1 and C5, then the substituents would be on adjacent carbons or not.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents' positions would vary, leading to different diastereomers or enantiomers.

Wait, but the starting material is racemic, so perhaps that doesn't influence the product count due to symmetry.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to count the possible products again.

In the case of 3-methylpent-1-ene undergoing ring-closing metathesis, the possible products would be:

1. A 5-membered ring (cyclopentene derivative).
2. A 4-membered ring (cyclobutene derivative).

But how many distinct structures does each ring have?

The 5-membered ring could have the methyl group in different positions.

Wait, the original structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

If the ring is formed by connecting C1 and C5, the ring would have five members. The substituents would be:

- The methyl group from C3.
- The CH2 groups from C1 and C4.

Hmm, perhaps each position in the ring is distinct.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5-membered ring can form in two different ways, leading to two different products.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the 5-membered ring is the only possible ring, leading to one product.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule can form two different 5-membered rings depending on where the catalyst breaks and reconnects.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible products again.

Another approach: Grubbs catalyst can cause the olefin to undergo various metathesis pathways. The number of possible products depends on the number of possible ways to break and re-form the double bonds.

In this molecule, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The possible metathesis could occur in such a way that the double bond shifts to another position or a ring is formed.

Wait, but I think the primary product would be a ring, so perhaps the number of possible rings is the key.

Wait, possibly, the molecule can form two different 5-membered rings, depending on where the connection is made.

Alternatively, perhaps the catalyst can form different rings based on which ends are connected.

Wait, perhaps the number of possible products is 4, but I'm not confident.

Wait, the options are up to 8. So perhaps each ring can form in two different configurations, leading to more products.

Wait, maybe considering the possibility of forming endo and exo products, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the racemic nature of the starting material leads to different products.

Wait, but since the starting material is racemic, meaning it's a 50-50 mix of two enantiomers, but each enantiomer would undergo the same metathesis reaction because the catalyst is achiral. So, the product count would be the same regardless of the enantiomer.

So, the racemic status doesn't change the number of products.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about another angle: the possible products from the metathesis. The metathesis can either form a ring or a new alkene.

Wait, but without another olefin, the only way to form a new alkene is via ring-closing. Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis can lead to the formation of a new alkene in a different position.

Wait, but in that case, we would have a different alkene product.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond can shift, but I'm not sure if Grubbs causes simple shifts without ring formation.

Wait, perhaps the reaction could break the double bond and form a new one elsewhere, leading to different alkenes.

So, the original structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

If the double bond breaks and reforms between C2 and C3, the product would be CH₂-CH₂-CH(CH3)=CH₂-CH3. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe the positions would change, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis could produce different alkenes, like 2-methylpent-1-ene, or 2-methylpent-2-ene, etc.

Wait, perhaps each possible metathesis site leads to a different product.

But I'm not sure about that. Maybe the number of possible products is determined by the number of possible alkenes formed via metathesis.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo multiple metathesis events, but I think Grubbs typically leads to one major product.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the molecule can undergo both ring-closing and cross metathesis with itself, leading to multiple products.

Wait, but cross metathesis typically involves two different alkenes. Since this is the same molecule, perhaps it can undergo self-metathesis.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can break and re-form in different ways, leading to multiple products.

Wait, but without knowing all the possible sites, it's hard to say.

I think I'm stuck, so maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options and what I know.

The question is about how many possible products are formed, excluding ethene.

If the main products are the rings formed, maybe there are two possible rings: a 4-membered and a 5-membered. Each of these could form in two different configurations, leading to a total of 4 products. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5-membered ring can form in two different ways, leading to two products. The 4-membered ring in two different ways, making another two. And perhaps another product from a different metathesis pathway. So, adding up to 4 products.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the molecule has a double bond between C1 and C2. In ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst can connect the CH2 from C1 with the CH3 from C5, leading to a 5-membered ring. Alternatively, it can connect the CH from C2 with the CH3 from C5, leading to another structure.

Wait, perhaps each connection leads to a different ring structure, leading to two products.

Wait, if that's the case, the number of products would be two. So, option D)2.

But I'm not confident because I might be missing other possibilities.

Alternatively, perhaps each connection leads to a different diastereomer, but I'm not sure.

Wait, in the case of a 5-membered ring, how many stereoisomers are possible? If the ring formation leads to a double bond inside the ring, the substituents could be cis or trans, leading to different products.

But without knowing the exact structures, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of possible products is two: one from connecting C1 to C5 and another from connecting C2 to C5.

So, that would make two products.

So, the answer could be D) 2.

But I'm not entirely sure, but I'll go with that.


--- Final Answer Content ---


Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst, which facilitates olefin metathesis. Grubbs catalyst can break and reform double bonds, leading to potential ring-closing metathesis or the formation of new alkenes. The starting molecule, 3-methylpent-1-ene, has the structure **CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃**, with a double bond between C1 and C2 and a methyl group at C3.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Ring-Closing Metathesis**:
   - Grubbs catalyst can break the double bond and reconnect the ends of the molecule to form rings. The possible ring sizes depend on which carbons are connected:
     - **5-Membered Ring**: Connecting C1 to C5 forms a 5-membered ring. This is the most likely product due to the stability of 5-membered rings.
     - **4-Membered Ring**: Connecting C1 to C4 or C2 to C5 forms a 4-membered ring. These are less likely due to ring strain but still possible.

2. **Exclusion of Ethene**:
   - The question specifies excluding ethene, so smaller fragments like ethene are not counted. The focus is on the larger products formed by ring-closing metathesis.

3. **Possible Products**:
   - The reaction can produce two distinct products:
     1. A **5-membered ring** (cyclopentene derivative) with substituents from the original molecule.
     2. A **4-membered ring** (cyclobutene derivative) with substituents from the original molecule.

4. **Racemic Mixture**:
   - The starting material is racemic, but Grubbs catalyst does not differentiate between enantiomers. Thus, the racemic nature does not increase the number of products.

### Conclusion:
The reaction produces two distinct products: one 5-membered ring and one 4-membered ring. Excluding ethene, the total number of possible products is **2**.

Answer: D
