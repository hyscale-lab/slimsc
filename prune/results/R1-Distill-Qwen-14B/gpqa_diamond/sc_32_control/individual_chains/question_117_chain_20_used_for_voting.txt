Okay, I've got this chemistry question about optical isomerism. Hmm, I need to figure out which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Let me think step by step.

First, I remember that optical isomerism, also known as enantiomerism, occurs when a compound has a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. When that happens, the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, leading to enantiomers which are non-superimposable mirror images. These enantiomers would rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions.

Looking at the options, there are four compounds. Let me go through each one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl structures can have some interesting stereochemistry. The substituents are on the benzene rings. Wait, 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, the two benzene rings are connected by a single bond. The question is whether this structure has any chiral centers. Wait, the central biphenyl structure—could that lead to any chirality?

Wait, in biphenyls, the substituents can be in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are on opposite sides, maybe there's a possibility of enantiomers. Alternatively, if there's a center with four different groups. Let me visualize this structure.

The molecule has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. On each ring, there are two substituents. Ring 1 has nitro groups at position 6 and a carboxylate at position 2. Similarly, ring 2 has nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2. Wait, the positions are on each ring. Let me think about the substituents.

Wait, the substituents are on the 2 and 6 positions on each ring. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Are the substituents arranged such that the molecule could have a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are in positions that create a plane, then maybe not chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule could have a center that's chiral.

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl itself can't have a chiral center because the single bond connecting the two benzene rings allows for rotation, so any substituents that would create a chiral center might not be fixed. Hmm, but wait, in some cases, substituents in biphenyls can lead to restricted rotation, like in the case of steric hindrance, but in this case, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a central carbon, but looking at the substituents, I don't think so. Wait, the substituents are on the benzene rings, not on a central carbon. So probably no chiral centers here. So this compound might not show optical isomerism. Or wait, maybe the central single bond allows for different configurations. But wait, can a single bond connecting two aromatic rings have a chiral center? Hmm, no. Chiral centers are carbons. So, for this compound, no chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, maybe the substituents on the benzene rings create some kind of asymmetry. Let me think: For a biphenyl, if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Suppose on each benzene ring, the substituents are arranged in a way that their positions lead to a chiral environment. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each benzene ring has substituents that create a chiral center elsewhere. Wait, no, the substituents are on the benzene, which is a ring, so unless a carbon attached to the benzene has four different groups, there's no chiral center.

Wait, but the substituents on the benzene are at 2 and 6 positions. Let's imagine each benzene ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. The other substituents are the biphenyl link. So each benzene has two substituents (but wait, 2 and 6 are opposite each other, so maybe they are on adjacent carbons? Wait, in a benzene ring, position 2 and 6 are adjacent, right? Wait, no, position 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3, position 6 is adjacent to 5 and 1. So positions 2 and 6 are adjacent via position 1. Wait, perhaps that's not the case. Anyway, each benzene has two substituents—maybe that's it. But I don't think that creates a chiral center. So maybe compound 1 doesn't have any optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I should think again. Maybe the compound has a chiral center elsewhere. Wait, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each benzene. So each benzene ring would have two substituents, but they are on each ring. Maybe the central carbon (the one connecting the two benzene rings) is connected to two different substituents on each benzene. Wait, but the central bond is a single bond; the carbon in the middle is part of both benzene rings. So, perhaps each benzene is attached to the central carbon. So the central carbon is connected to two benzene rings and two other groups? No, each benzene ring is attached to the central carbon, but the substituents are on the benzene. So the central carbon is connected to two benzene rings and two other substituents? Wait, maybe not. Let me try to draw this mentally. The structure is [1,1'-biphenyl], so the two benzene rings are connected via a single bond between their 1 positions. So each benzene has substituents at 2 and 6. So on each benzene, positions 1 is connected to the other ring, position 2 has a carboxylate ester, and position 6 has a nitro group.

Wait, the central carbon (the one connecting the two benzene rings) is part of both benzene rings. So each benzene ring has a substituent at 2 and 6. So the central carbon is attached to two benzene rings and perhaps two other substituents? No, each benzene is attached via position 1 to the central carbon. So the central carbon is connected to two benzene rings and two more substituents? Wait, no. Each benzene is connected to the central carbon via their position 1, which is a single carbon. So the central carbon is bonded to two benzene rings and two other groups? No, wait, the central carbon is in the biphenyl structure, so it's bonded to two benzene rings and perhaps another two groups. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So the structure is two benzene rings connected at their 1 positions. Each benzene has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. The esters are dimethyl, so both are OMe groups attached to the carbonyls.

Wait, the substituents on each benzene are at 2 and 6. So each benzene ring has a nitro at 6, a carboxylate ester at 2, and is connected via position 1 to the other benzene ring. So each benzene ring has three substituents: the two substituents (nitro and ester) and the connection to the other ring. Wait, no, because the 1 position is connected to the other ring, so each benzene has substituents at 2 and 6. So each benzene ring has two substituents. So the central carbon is part of both benzene rings and is attached to two other substituents? Hmm, I'm not sure. But I think that the central carbon doesn't have four different groups because it's part of the aromatic rings. So, maybe there's no chiral center here. Therefore, compound 1 probably doesn't show optical isomerism.

Hmm, moving on. Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break that down. The formula is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, the structure is propanoate ester. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but in this case, it's 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, no, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)-CH3

Wait, wait, no. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. But wait, the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3? Or maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure would be:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but wait, that's 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the molecule is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, no, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxy would be on the CH2 in the middle. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but that would be a three-carbon chain: the first carbon is CH2(OH), the second is CH2 connected to the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- a CH2(OH) group,

- a CH2COOCH3 group,

- two CH2 groups? Wait, no, perhaps I should draw it as:

The molecule is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be (CH2OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no, let me correct this. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The 2 position is the middle carbon. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think of propanoate as:

CH2-CH2-COO^-.

If it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, then the OH is on the middle CH2. So it's:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, but in that case, the central carbon (the middle CH2) is attached to:

- a CH2(OH) group,

- two CH2 groups (left and right),

- and a COOCH3 group?

Wait, no, the structure would be:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, that's a four-carbon chain? No, wait, propanoate is three carbons: COOCH3 is the first, then CH2, then CH2(OH). Wait, no, the structure is:

COOCH3 is the first carbon, then CH2, then CH2(OH). So the molecule is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In that structure, the central carbon is CH2 connected to two CH2 groups and a COOCH3 group. Wait, no: the structure is:

The carbonyl is at the end. So the structure is:

COOCH3 is the first carbon, then CH2, then CH(OH)CH3?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, maybe I should think about whether the molecule has a chiral center. Let's consider the central carbon. Is there a carbon with four different groups attached?

In the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3.

Wait, wait, no. The formula is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-OH

Wait, that can't be right because that's a four-carbon chain, but propanoate is three. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the three carbons are: COOCH3, CH2, and CH2(OH). So the central carbon (CH2 between COOCH3 and CH2(OH)) is connected to:

- COOCH3,

- two CH2 groups (left and right),

- and an OH group.

Wait, no, the central carbon is CH2, so each CH2 is connected to two CH2 groups. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to represent it as:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-OH.

No, that would be a four-carbon chain, but propanoate is three carbons. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (the second CH2) is attached to:

- One hydroxyl group (from CH2(OH)),

- Two CH2 groups (the ones on either side),

Wait, no. On the second CH2, the groups are:

- One CH2(OH),

- One CH2COOCH3,

- Two H's.

Wait, that's not four different groups. So the central carbon is attached to:

Group 1: CH2OH,

Group 2: CH2COOCH3,

Group 3: two H's.

So, no, that's not four different groups. So, no chiral center there. Hmm, but wait, maybe the other carbon. Let me check the carbons.

Wait, let's number the carbons. The COOCH3 is on the first carbon (carbonyl), then the second is CH2, the third is CH2OH, and the fourth is the methyl from the ester. Wait, that can't be right because propanoate is only three carbons.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let's think of propanoate as:

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the middle CH2. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the carbons are:

1: COOCH3,

2: CH2,

3: CH2OH.

Wait, but the second carbon (CH2) is connected to:

- COOCH3 on one side,

- CH2OH on the other,

and two H's.

So the groups on the second carbon are: COOCH3, CH2OH, and two H's. So that's three groups, but wait, that can't be right. No, each carbon has four bonds. So the second carbon is CH2, which has two H's attached, and is connected to the COOCH3 group on one side and the CH2OH group on the other.

Wait, perhaps the second carbon is CH2, so it's bonded to:

- COOCH3,

- CH2OH,

- and two H's.

So, four groups: COOCH3, CH2OH, and two H's. So, are any of these groups the same? The two H's are same, but the other two are different. So, this carbon is bonded to:

Group 1: COOCH3,

Group 2: CH2OH,

Group 3: H,

Group 4: H.

So, groups 3 and 4 are same (H), groups 1 and 2 are different. So, the second carbon has two H's, a CH2OH, and a COOCH3 group. So, it's not a chiral center because two groups are same (the H's), so it doesn't have four different groups. So, no chiral center there. So, does this compound have any chiral centers?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Are there any other carbons? The COOCH3 is on the first carbon, which is double-bonded to O. The third carbon is CH2OH, which is a CH2 group attached to OH. So, the third carbon is CH2 which is connected to:

- CH2 group from the second carbon,

- OH,

- and two H's.

So groups on third carbon: CH2, OH, and two H's. Again, two H's are same, so not a chiral center.

Wait a second, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. The structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the three carbons are:

1: COOCH3,

2: CH2,

3: CH2OH.

So, is there any carbon with four different substituents?

Carbon 2: attached to COOCH3 (group 1), CH2OH (group 2), and two H's (groups 3 and 4). So groups 3 and 4 are same; so no, not four different.

Carbon 3: attached to CH2 (group 1), OH (group 2), and two H's (groups 3 and 4). Again, same as above.

Carbon 1: double bonded to O, so no.

Wait, so maybe this compound doesn't have a chiral center. But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the actual structure:

The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

So, methyl ester would be CH2CH2COOCH3.

2-hydroxypropanoate would have an OH on the middle carbon. So the structure would be:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-OH

Wait, that's not correct because that would make the structure as CH2-CH2-OH connected to the carbonyl. Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3.

Wait, that's another possibility. Because 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon of the propanoate.

So, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

So, 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-.

Wait, but then the ester is methyl, so it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In that structure, the central carbon (the second CH2) is connected to:

- CH2(OH),

- CH2COOCH3,

and two H's.

So, again, that's two H's, so no four different groups.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm missing that the CH2 groups are actually CH2 groups with different substituents. Wait, the first CH2 (from the COOCH3) is connected to the COOCH3 and the next CH2. The next CH2 is connected to the OH and another CH2.

Wait, perhaps the hydroxyl is on the second carbon, making that carbon a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, that would make the second carbon (CH(OH)) attached to:

- COOCH3,

- CH3,

- OH,

- and another CH3.

Wait, no, that can't be. Let me think again.

If the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, then the middle carbon (CHOH) would be attached to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another CH3 (from the adjacent carbon? No, wait.

Wait, the structure would be:

CH3-CHOH-COOCH3? That can't be right because that would make a three-carbon chain, with the middle carbon attached to CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another group. Wait, that's four groups.

So, the middle carbon is attached to:

1: CH3,

2: COOCH3,

3: OH,

4: the adjacent carbon (which is the one from the ester? Or is it another CH3? I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which would imply the middle carbon is CH2, which doesn't have four different groups.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the IUPAC name: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-.

So the ester is methyl, so the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the three carbons are:

1: COOCH3,

2: CH2,

3: CH2OH.

So, the central carbon is CH2, which is connected to:

- COOCH3,

- CH2OH,

- two H's.

So, same as before: two H's, which means no four different groups. So no chiral center. So, this compound doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Another possibility: perhaps the hydroxyl group is on a carbon that is connected to four different groups. Let me think: if the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, then the central carbon (CH2) has:

- COOCH3,

- CH2OH,

- two H's.

So, groups: COOCH3, CH2OH, H, H. So, only three different groups. No, that's not possible.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mistaken. Maybe the structure is different. Let me think of the actual structure again. The formula for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, if that's the case, then the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the middle carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another CH3 (from the adjacent carbon? No, wait, in this structure, the middle carbon is connected to CH3, COOCH3, OH, and the adjacent carbon (the CH3 is on the first carbon, the COOCH3 on the third, and the OH on the second. So the middle carbon has:

Groups:

1: CH3,

2: COOCH3,

3: OH,

4: CH2.

Wait, no, the adjacent carbon is CH3 (from the first carbon) and the next is the COOCH3 (third carbon). So the middle carbon is attached to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and the adjacent carbon (which is the one from the CH3 group). Wait, no, the adjacent carbon is CH3, so perhaps the middle carbon is connected to CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH3? No, that can't be because that would make two CH3 groups.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, making the middle carbon attached to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and the adjacent carbon is CH3 (from the first carbon). So, two CH3 groups. So, groups:

1: CH3,

2: COOCH3,

3: OH,

4: CH3.

So, groups 1 and 4 are same (CH3), so the middle carbon has three different groups. So, no, not four different groups. So, no chiral center.

Wait, but that can't be right. I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently. Maybe I'm wrong about the structure. Another approach: if the compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, it's possible that the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which doesn't have a chiral center. But if the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the middle carbon is attached to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another group which could be CH2. Wait, but that's not possible. Let me just accept that maybe this compound doesn't have a chiral center. So, compound 2 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait! Another possibility: maybe the structure is CH2(OH)COOCH2CH3. No, that's not the case because the name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is an ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The ester would be formed by replacing the -OH of the acid with -OCH3.

So, the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

The ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

In which case, the middle carbon (CH2) has:

- CH2(OH),

- CH2COOCH3,

- two H's.

So, again, two H's, so no four different groups. So, no chiral center.

Hmm, so compound 2 doesn't show optical isomerism. But wait, what if the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Let's see. Then the middle carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another CH3? No, that would make two CH3 groups. So groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and CH3.

No, that's three groups. So, no chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck, but let's proceed to the next compound and see.

Compound 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. So, two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl group. The structure is Ar-CO-Ar. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's a ketone. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's sp2 hybridized. So, the carbonyl carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and an O.

Wait, the carbonyl carbon has three substituents: two phenyl groups and an O. So, what about the structure? The carbonyl carbon has two phenyl groups, one O (double bond), and perhaps another substituent? No, benzophenone has only two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl. So, the structure is:

Ph-C(=O)-Ph.

So, the carbonyl carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and an O double bond. So, it's only connected to three groups, so it can't be a chiral center. Chiral centers need four single bonds. So, no optical isomerism here.

Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Wait, fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So, dimethyl fumarate would be the diester of fumaric acid, so its structure is:

CH2CH2(COOCH3)2 with the double bond in the trans configuration.

Wait, no, more accurately, fumarate is the trans isomer. So, dimethyl fumarate has the structure:

(CH2)2(COOCH3)2 with a double bond between the two CH2 groups in the trans configuration.

Wait, more precisely, it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O-C-OCH3
    ||
    O

Wait, no, that's not right. Fumarate is the trans isomer of the diacid. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
COOCH3

But with the double bond. So, the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, but the correct structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but in the trans (E) configuration. So, the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with the double bond in between, but wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between the two CH2? No, wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the double bond between the two CH groups. So, the structure is:

HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH is maleic acid? No, maleic acid is cis, fumaric is trans.

Wait, no, maleic acid is (Z)-HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's not correct. Let me correct. Maleic acid is (Z)-HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H, while fumaric acid is (E)-HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H.

So, dimethyl fumarate would be the diester, so the structure is:

(CH2CH2(COOCH3)2) with a double bond between the CH's in the trans configuration.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3
    \
CH2-CH2
    /
COOCH3

Wait, no. The correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no, that's not right. The correct structure is:

Each of the double-bonded carbons is attached to a COOCH3 group and a methyl group. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the ester would have each -OH replaced by OMe. So, the structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, that's correct. So, the two COOCH3 groups are on each end of the double bond.

So, the molecule is:

COOCH3
     \
CH2-CH2
     /
COOCH3

No, that's not correct. The correct structure is:

COOCH3
   \
CH2-CH2
   /
COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me get this straight. Fumarate is the trans di-ester of fumaric acid, which is (E)-butenedioic acid.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3-O=CH-CH2-COOCH3?

No, no. Let me think of it as:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

So, each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group attached. Wait, but that would be CH2=C(COOCH3)2. No, because that would be a single carbon with two COOCH3 groups, which isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But that would be a single bond between the two CH2 groups, but fumarate has a double bond.

Ah, I think I've got it now. Dimethyl fumarate is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no. Each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So, the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, but that would mean the double bond is between two carbons, each attached to two COOCH3 groups. Wait, that's not possible because each carbon can only have four bonds. So, each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups and a double bond.

Wait, that can't be. So, perhaps the correct structure is:

Each carbon in the double bond has one COOCH3 and one CH3 group. No, that's not correct. Wait, let me think again. Fumarate is derived from fumaric acid, which is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the esterification replaces the -OHs with OMe groups. So, the structure becomes:

COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3.

So, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite ends of the double bond. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH=CH
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

So, the molecule has a central double bond (CH=CH) with COOCH3 groups on each end.

Now, this molecule has a plane of symmetry along the double bond axis. So, would this molecule show optical isomerism?

Optical isomerism requires the presence of a chiral center or a chiral plane. But in this case, the molecule has a center of symmetry. Let's see: if you rotate the molecule 180 degrees around the double bond axis, the configuration remains the same. Therefore, the molecule is meso, meaning it has an internal plane of symmetry and thus is achiral. So, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Fumarate is the trans isomer. So, the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite each other. In dimethyl fumarate, each COOCH3 is on opposite sides of the double bond. Wait, does that create a chiral center?

Wait, each carbon in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two other groups. Let's consider each carbon in the double bond:

Each carbon is attached to:

- One COOCH3 group,

- Another group (from the double bond),

- And two H's? Or perhaps more.

Wait, no, in the structure I thought of earlier: COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3. Each CH is connected to a COOCH3 and another CH (double bond). So, each CH is attached to:

- COOCH3,

- the double bond (so two bonds to the same carbon),

- and two H's.

So, each CH is attached to COOCH3, two H's, and the double bond. So, each carbon in the double bond is CH, attached to COOCH3, H, H, and another CH (double bond).

So, each carbon has two H's, making it impossible to be a chiral center. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another moment. Fumarate is the trans di-ester. So, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Does that create any possibility for enantiomers?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. The structure is symmetric along the double bond. So, the two COOCH3 groups are mirror images across the double bond. Therefore, the molecule is achiral, so no optical isomerism.

So, compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism either.

Wait, but wait. I'm getting this wrong because I remember that fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate. Fumarate has a trans double bond, while maleate is cis. Dimethyl fumarate would have the trans configuration in the di-ester, so the substituents are on opposite sides. So, in this case, each ester group is on opposite sides of the double bond.

But does that create any chiral centers? No, because each carbon in the double bond is attached to two H's. So, no, they're not chiral centers.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. If each carbon in the double bond has two H's, then each can't be a chiral center. So, no, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

Now, reviewing all four compounds:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: No chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: I thought there was no chiral center. But wait, maybe I got the structure wrong earlier.

3. Benzophenone: No chiral centers.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: No chiral centers, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm thinking that maybe I was wrong about compound 2. Let me double-check.

Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

The formula is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's not correct because propanoate is three carbons. So, the correct structure would be:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

But that doesn't have a chiral center because the middle carbon has two H's. Alternatively, if the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the middle carbon (CH(OH)) would have:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another CH3.

Wait, no, that would make two CH3 groups, so no, the middle carbon would have three different groups and one same, so no chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Another possibility: perhaps the hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the ester.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon of the propanoate. So, the structure would be:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the second carbon (CH2) has:

- CH2(OH),

- CH2COOCH3,

- two H's.

So, groups are: CH2(OH), CH2COOCH3, H, H. So, two H's, so no four different groups. No chiral center.

Wait, but perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3.

In that case, the middle carbon is attached to:

- COOCH3,

- CH3,

- OH,

- and the adjacent CH3 (from the end).

So, groups would be: COOCH3, CH3, OH, CH3.

So, two CH3 groups. So, no, that's three different groups, making it a chiral center. Wait, wait, if the groups are:

1. COOCH3,

2. CH3,

3. OH,

4. CH3.

Then, groups 2 and 4 are same (CH3). So, that's three different groups, meaning no chiral center.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Let me think of the actual molecule. If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the middle carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another CH3 (from the adjacent carbon? No, that can't be, because the adjacent carbon is CH3, but the middle carbon is CH(OH), so the groups are CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH3? No, that would give two CH3 groups.

Wait, no, the structure would be:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the middle carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and the adjacent carbon (the one from the COOCH3 group, which is a carbonyl, so it's a double bond, so the middle carbon is attached to:

- CH3 (from the left),

- COOCH3 (from the right),

- OH,

- and a hydrogen? No, wait, that can't be. The structure of CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3 would have the middle carbon as CH(OH), which is attached to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another H.

So, the groups are:

1. CH3,

2. COOCH3,

3. OH,

4. H.

So, four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, H. So, yes! That's a chiral center. Oh! I think I got it wrong earlier. So, the middle carbon is CH(OH) attached to four different groups. So, that would make it a chiral center.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought the structure didn't have a chiral center, but now I'm realizing that if the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the middle carbon is chiral.

So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recap: the name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, 2-hydroxy would be on the middle CH2. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. But in that structure, the middle carbon is CH2, which isn't a chiral center.

Wait, but maybe the correct structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, which would imply the OH is on the second carbon of propanoate, which is the same as the middle carbon. So, the structure would be:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In this case, the middle carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So, yes, it's a chiral center.

So, the correct structure for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, which has a chiral center. So, it exhibits optical isomerism.

So, putting it all together:

Compound 1: No chiral center, no optical isomerism.

Compound 2: Yes, chiral center, exhibits optical isomerism.

Compound 3: No chiral center, no optical isomerism.

Compound 4: No chiral center, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. I thought fumarate might have some kind of stereoisomerism, but no, the molecule is symmetric.

So, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is compound 2.

Wait, but the options are about which compounds show optical isomerism. So, looking at the options:

Options:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → No, because 1 and 4 don't.

B) 3 and 4 → No.

C) 2 and 3 → No, because 3 doesn't.

D) 1 and 2 → No, 1 doesn't.

Wait, but according to my latest conclusion, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck the options:

Options:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

Wait, but according to my analysis, only 2 has optical isomerism. So, the answer would be only 2. But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4, dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, let me think again about compound 4. The structure is (E)-dimethyl fumarate, which is:

COOCH3
     \
CH2-CH2
     /
COOCH3

No, wait, that's incorrect. The correct structure is:

COOCH3
   \
CH2-CH2
   /
COOCH3

But that's not possible because that would be a single bond. Fumarate has a double bond. So, the correct structure is:

COOCH3
   \
CH2=CH2
   /
COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So, the structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no, that can't be because that would have two COOCH3 groups on the same carbon. So, the correct structure is:

Each of the two carbons in the double bond has one COOCH3 group. So, the structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no, that would mean each CH is attached to two COOCH3 groups, which isn't possible. So, the correct structure must be:

Each carbon in the double bond has one COOCH3 group and one CH2 group. No, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the di-ester (dimethyl fumarate) is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, that would imply each of the two CH groups is attached to two COOCH3 groups, which isn't possible. Alternatively, the structure is:

COOCH3
   \
CH2-CH2
   /
COOCH3

But that's for the single bond. For the double bond, it's:

COOCH3
   \
CH2=CH2
   /
COOCH3

Wait, that's not correct either. Let me get this straight. The correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, but that can't be because each CH can only have four bonds. So, perhaps the correct structure is:

Each of the two CH groups in the double bond has one COOCH3 group attached.

So, the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, but that would mean each CH has two COOCH3 groups, which is impossible because each carbon can only have four bonds. So, it's more likely that each CH has one COOCH3 group and another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3).

No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the correct structure is:

CH2=CH-COOCH3.

No, that's not right. I'm getting stuck again. Let me consider that dimethyl fumarate has two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
   \
CH2-CH2
   /
COOCH3

But with a double bond in between. So, it's:

COOCH3
   \
CH2=CH2
   /
COOCH3.

No, that's impossible because CH2=CH2 is ethylene, which doesn't have substituents.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

Each of the two carbons in the double bond has one COOCH3 group and one methyl group. Wait, no, because the ester is dimethyl, so each COOCH3 is attached to a methyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
   \
CH2-CH2
   /
COOCH3

But as a double bond, it's:

COOCH3
   \
CH2=CH2
   /
COOCH3.

That can't be right because CH2=CH2 is just ethylene without substituents.

I think I'm stuck on this. Let me try a different approach. Fumarate is the trans di-ester of fumaric acid. So, the structure is:

COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3.

In this structure, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, each carbon in the double bond has one COOCH3 group and another substituent (which is a CH2 group or something else? I'm getting confused.

Wait, in the case of fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are trans to each other across the double bond. So, each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. So, the structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, but that's not possible because each CH can only have four bonds. So, perhaps the structure is:

Each CH in the double bond is attached to one COOCH3 and one CH3 group. So, the structure is:

CH2=C(CH2COOCH3)2.

No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

But that would mean each CH is attached to two COOCH3 groups, which isn't possible. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

Each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
   \
CH2=CH2
   /
COOCH3.

But that's not correct because CH2=CH2 is just ethylene, and adding substituents would require more carbons.

I think I'm getting stuck because I'm confusing the structure. Let me accept that dimethyl fumarate has a double bond and two ester groups on opposite sides, making it a trans configuration. But does this create any chiral centers? No, because each carbon in the double bond is attached to two identical groups (COOCH3 and H? Or maybe two different groups).

Wait, each carbon in the double bond is attached to:

- COOCH3,

- the other carbon in the double bond,

- and possibly two H's.

So, each carbon in the double bond is CH, attached to COOCH3, H, H, and the other CH.

So, each CH has two H's, meaning no chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.

So, going back to the compounds:

Only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, none of them have only compound 2 as the answer. Let me recheck the options.

Options:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → Includes 1 and 4, which I think don't exhibit isomerism.

B) 3 and 4 → No.

C) 2 and 3 → Compound 3 doesn't exhibit isomerism.

D) 1 and 2 → Compound 1 doesn't exhibit isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought compound 2 does. So, the correct answer would be only compound 2, but that's not an option. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure is two benzene rings connected via a single bond at positions 1 and 1'. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. So, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring.

If the substituents are arranged such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then no chiral centers. But, if the arrangement leads to a chiral center, then it would exhibit isomerism.

Wait, but the molecule is a biphenyl, and the substituents are in positions that may create a chiral center. Let me think of the central carbon (the one connecting the two benzene rings). Is that carbon a chiral center?

Each benzene ring is connected to the central carbon. Each benzene has substituents at 2 and 6, which are opposite each other. So, the central carbon is connected to two benzene rings, each with nitro and ester groups at 6 and 2 positions.

Wait, but the central carbon is bonded to two benzene rings and two other substituents? Or is it just the two rings?

Wait, the central carbon is part of both benzene rings. So, each ring is connected via their 1 position to the central carbon, which is part of both rings. So, the central carbon is bonded to two benzene rings and nothing else? No, that can't be. Each benzene ring is connected via a single bond, so the central carbon is part of both rings, so it's bonded to two other carbons (from each benzene ring) and perhaps other substituents.

Wait, perhaps the central carbon is bonded to four different substituents. Let me imagine:

The central carbon is bonded to:

- Two benzene rings (each attached at positions 1 and 1'),

- Two ester groups (from positions 2 and 2' of each benzene),

- Two nitro groups (from positions 6 and 6' of each benzene).

Wait, no, that's not possible because each substituent is on a benzene ring, not directly attached to the central carbon.

Wait, perhaps the central carbon is bonded to:

- Two phenyl groups,

- Two ester groups (from the 2 positions),

- Two nitro groups (from the 6 positions).

No, that's not correct. Each substituent (nitro and ester) is on the benzene rings, not directly attached to the central carbon.

So, the central carbon is part of both benzene rings and is connected to them. So, it doesn't have four substituents beyond the benzene rings. Therefore, it's not a chiral center.

So, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, going back, only compound 2 has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism. But none of the options match this. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate has a double bond and two ester groups on opposite sides. Does this create any possibility for enantiomers?

Wait, perhaps the molecule is chiral because of the arrangement. For example, if the substituents are on opposite sides of the double bond, perhaps leading to a lack of a plane of symmetry.

Wait, considering the structure:

COOCH3
   \
CH2=CH2
   /
COOCH3

But that's not correct. The correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

But that's impossible because each CH can't have two COOCH3 groups. So, perhaps the correct structure is:

Each of the two carbons in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group and a methyl group. So, the structure is:

CH2=C(CH2COOCH3)2.

No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps each carbon in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. So, the structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

But that's not possible because each CH can only have three substituents plus the double bond.

I think I'm stuck, so perhaps I should proceed to the conclusion.

Based on my analysis, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But since the options don't include an option with only 2, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 4. Let me think: dimethyl fumarate has a structure where the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, making it a trans configuration. If the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, it could be chiral.

Wait, if the structure is:

COOCH3
   \
CH2=CH2
   /
COOCH3

But this would imply the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite ends of the double bond, leading to a possible lack of symmetry. So, perhaps this creates a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, but each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. No, that can't be. I'm getting stuck, perhaps I should accept that dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers.

In that case, the only compound exhibiting optical isomerism is compound 2. But since none of the options include only 2, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, so it is achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, the correct answer would be only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking at the options, option A includes 2 and 4, which I think is incorrect. Option D includes 1 and 2, which I think is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should look back at the initial analysis. Maybe I was wrong about compound 1.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

If the molecule has a central carbon that's part of both benzene rings, and each ring's substituents are such that the central carbon is attached to four different groups, then it would be a chiral center.

Wait, the central carbon is bonded to:

- Two benzene rings,

- Two ester groups (from the 2 positions on each benzene),

- Two nitro groups (from the 6 positions on each benzene).

Wait, no, that can't be because the substituents are on the benzene rings, not directly attached to the central carbon.

So, the central carbon is part of both benzene rings, but it's not bonded to any substituents beyond that. Therefore, it's not a chiral center.

So, no optical isomerism in compound 1.

Thus, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't include this. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of compound 2.

Wait, perhaps the structure of compound 2 is different. Let me think again: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

The structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, that's a four-carbon chain? No, propanoate is three carbons. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this structure, the middle carbon (CH2) has two H's, so no chiral center.

But wait, if the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the middle carbon is CH(OH), attached to CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH3? No, that's not possible. So, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In this case, the middle carbon is CH(OH), attached to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another CH3 (from the adjacent carbon? No, the adjacent carbon is the COOCH3 group, which is a double bond, so maybe not.)

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3.

In this case, the middle carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- COOCH3,

- CH3,

- OH,

- and another CH3.

So, groups: COOCH3, CH3, OH, CH3. So, two CH3 groups, making it not a chiral center.

Therefore, perhaps compound 2 doesn't have a chiral center and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

But that would mean none of the compounds exhibit optical isomerism, which is not an option.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Another approach: which of the compounds have a chiral center.

Compound 1: No.

Compound 2: Maybe yes.

Compound 3: No.

Compound 4: No.

So, if only compound 2 has a chiral center, then the answer would be only 2, but the options don't have that. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, perhaps the correct answer is only compound 2, but since the options don't include that, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option A, which includes 2 and 4.

Alternatively, perhaps compound 4 does have a chiral center. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate: each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So, each carbon is attached to:

- COOCH3,

- the other carbon in the double bond,

- and two H's.

So, each carbon in the double bond is CH, with two H's. So, no chiral centers.

So, I think the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is compound 2. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 2 and 4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate is the trans di-ester. So, the substituents are on opposite sides of the double bond. Does this create any possibility for enantiomers? No, because the molecule has a plane of symmetry along the double bond. So, it is achiral.

Therefore, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 1. Let me think again.

Compound 1: If the substituents are in positions that create a chiral center in the biphenyl structure. For example, if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it could be chiral.

Wait, in the biphenyl structure, if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule lack a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral. For example, if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image.

In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on each ring, and they are nitro and ester groups. So, the arrangement could be such that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, leading to a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the central carbon (the one connecting the two benzene rings) is a chiral center. Let me think: the central carbon is bonded to two benzene rings and two other substituents. Wait, no, the substituents are on the benzene rings, not directly attached to the central carbon.

So, the central carbon is part of both benzene rings and is connected to them. So, it's not a chiral center because it's bonded to only two different groups (the two benzene rings) and nothing else.

Therefore, no chiral center in compound 1.

So, after all this, I think only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 2 and 4, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: looking for any other possibilities. Are there any other compounds that might have a chiral center?

Wait, perhaps compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. If the molecule is meso, then it's achiral. But if it's not meso, it could be chiral. Wait, but fumarate is trans, so perhaps the molecule is symmetric, making it meso and thus achiral.

So, in conclusion, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 4. Let me think again: dimethyl fumarate has a structure where the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Could this lead to a lack of symmetry, making the molecule chiral?

If the structure is such that the two ester groups are on opposite sides, the molecule might not have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. But I'm not sure.

In reality, dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. Fumarate is the trans isomer, which is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry. Maleate is the cis isomer, which is also achiral because it's a meso compound.

Wait, no. Actually, both the cis and trans isomers of dimethyl fumarate and maleate are achiral because they have planes of symmetry. So, compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is compound 2. But none of the options have only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the question again. The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

I think I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4. Let me think again: could dimethyl fumarate have a plane of symmetry? The structure is:

COOCH3
   \
CH2=CH2
   /
COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct structure is:

Each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So, the structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, but that's not possible because each carbon can't have two COOCH3 groups. So, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
   \
CH2-CH2
   /
COOCH3

But with a double bond. So, it's:

COOCH3
   \
CH2=CH2
   /
COOCH3.

But this implies the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite ends of the double bond, making the molecule symmetric. So, it's achiral.

Thus, compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is compound 2. But the options don't include this. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 2 and 4, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 1. Let me think: the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each benzene ring. Are these positions such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry?

If the substituents are in such a way that the molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image, then it would have optical isomerism. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the molecule could have a center of symmetry, making it achiral.

I think I'm stuck. Based on my analysis, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't have that, so perhaps the correct answer is option A, including compounds 2 and 4, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4. Let me think: dimethyl fumarate. If the structure is such that each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a different substituent, then perhaps it has a chiral center.

Wait, if the structure is:

COOCH3
   \
CH2-CH2
   /
COOCH3

But with a double bond, then it's:

COOCH3
   \
CH2=CH2
   /
COOCH3.

No, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps each CH in the double bond has a COOCH3 and a different group, like a methyl. But that's not the case for dimethyl fumarate.

I think I'm stuck and should proceed to the conclusion. Based on the analysis, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But since the options don't include this, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 2 and 4, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about compound 4 again. Dimethyl fumarate is the trans di-ester. So, the substituents are on opposite sides of the double bond. Does this create any possibility for enantiomers? No, because the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, it's achiral.

Thus, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is compound 2. But since the options don't have this, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 2 and 4, but I must have made a mistake.

After reconsidering, I think the correct answer is option A: 1, 2, and 4 exhibit optical isomerism. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps compound 1 has a chiral center. Let me think: the two benzene rings are connected at their 1 positions. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, the substituents on each ring are at positions 2 and 6, which are across from each other. So, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Thus, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is compound 2. But since none of the options have this, perhaps the correct answer is option A, including 2 and 4, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4. Let me think again: dimethyl fumarate has a double bond, and the two ester groups are on opposite sides. If the substituents are arranged such that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral. But I think it's symmetric.

In conclusion, I think only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism, but since the options don't include that, I might have made a mistake in my analysis. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, including compounds 2 and 4, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the ester groups in compound 1. If the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the biphenyl structure, perhaps making the molecule chiral. But I'm not sure.

After all this, I think the correct answer is option A: 1, 2, and 4 exhibit optical isomerism. But I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has at least one chiral center, leading to non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond at the 1 positions, with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. The central carbon is part of both benzene rings and is not bonded to four different groups. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.  
   **Conclusion:** No optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The middle carbon (CH(OH)) is bonded to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.  
   **Conclusion:** Exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂C=O, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and cannot be a chiral center. The molecule is symmetric and lacks any chiral centers.  
   **Conclusion:** No optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the trans di-ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₂=C(COOCH₃)₂. The two COOCH₃ groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. The molecule has a plane of symmetry along the double bond axis, making it achiral.  
   **Conclusion:** No optical isomerism.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, only **compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate)** exhibits optical isomerism. However, none of the provided options include only compound 2. The closest option that includes compound 2 is **A (1, 2, and 4)**, but compounds 1 and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism. Despite this inconsistency, the answer must align with the given options.

**Answer: A**
