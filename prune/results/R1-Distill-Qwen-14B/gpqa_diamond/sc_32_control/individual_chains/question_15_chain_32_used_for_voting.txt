Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question says.

So, there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. They've already detected them using the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives them the minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Their orbits are circular, which probably matters because eccentricity can affect transit probability, but in this case, both are zero.

The host stars have different masses, but the same radii. The star with Planet_1 is twice as massive as the one hosting Planet_2. Interesting. But both stars have the same radius, which I guess is a bit counterintuitive because more massive stars are usually larger, but maybe Planet_2's host is a subgiant or something that's expanding but hasn't yet.

The question is about the probability of transit. So, I think transit probability depends on the orbital distance (semi-major axis) and the star's size. The closer a planet is to its star, the higher the chance of it passing in front from our point of view. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting is higher when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The formula for the transit probability is something like (R_star / a) where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, actually, it's more like (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since planets are small compared to stars, it's roughly R_star / a.

Wait, no, the formula is actually (R_* / a) * ( (a (1 - e²))^(1/2) ) ... but since both orbits are circular, e=0, so it simplifies. So the transit probability is proportional to (R_* / a). But wait, I might be mixing up some terms.

Wait, another thought: the transit probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance (a). So P_transit ≈ (R_*/a) * (some factor based on the alignment). But since we don't know the orientation, the probability is maximized when the orbit is edge-on, but on average, for randomly oriented orbits, the probability is proportional to R_*/(a) multiplied by the probability that the orbital plane is edge-on enough.

Wait, no, the geometric probability is actually (R_*/a) * ( (1 + (R_*/a)^2 )^{-1/2} )) or something? Hmm. I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me think again. The transit probability (the chance that the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view) depends on the size of the star relative to the planet's orbital distance. The formula I remember is P = (R_star + R_planet) / (a * (1 - e²)^0.5 ). But since e=0 here, it simplifies. Also, since the planets are Earth-like, their radii are much smaller than the stars, so R_planet is negligible. So P ≈ R_* / a.

But wait, no. Let me get this right. The probability is actually the ratio of the area of the star's disk as seen from Earth to the area of the planet's orbit, but that's not exactly right either. Alternatively, the probability can be approximated by (R_* + R_p) / a, but the exact formula might be more nuanced.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to remember that for a circular orbit, the probability is (R_* / a) * ( (1 + (R_* / a))^0 ) * ... No, that's not right. Alternatively, the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits is roughly (R_*/a) multiplied by something else?

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula for transit probability. Oh wait, I can't do that right now, but I can try to derive it.

The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The inclination i of the orbit must be close to 90 degrees. The probability of transit is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis, but I might need to consider the solid angle or something.

Wait, another approach: The transit probability for a circular orbit is (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 + (R_star / a)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the transit probability P is given by (R_star / a) * ( (1 + (R_star / a) ) )^{-1} }.

Wait, sorry, perhaps I should think in terms of the area. The transit probability is the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the planet's orbit. Hmm, but that's not exactly correct because the planet's orbit is a circle, and the chance that the planet passes in front depends on the alignment.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is (R_*/a) times ( (1 + (R_*/ a)) )^{-1}. No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_*/a) * (1/(1 - e^2))^0.5 ), but e=0, so it's just R_*/a. But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, here's a different approach. Let me recall that for a planet in a given orbit, the probability of transit is approximately (R_*/a) multiplied by a factor (some function of the orbital distance and the star's size). But I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Hill sphere or something else, but maybe not. Let me try to find another way.

Okay, let's think of the orbital distance a. The transit occurs when the line of sight is within the plane of the planet's orbit. The probability is higher when the planet is closer to the star because a is smaller, making R_*/a larger. So, for a given star, a planet with a smaller orbital period (so closer in) would have a higher probability of transiting.

In this problem, Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star. So in terms of a, Planet_1's a is smaller than Planet_2's a. Because orbital period P is related to a via Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4π²/G(M+m)) a^3 ≈ (4π²/(G M)) a^3, since M >> m. So a^3 = (G M P^2)/(4π²). So a is proportional to P^(2/3) * M^(-1/3).

Wait, so for the same planet mass, the semi-major axis a depends on the mass of the star and the period. So, since Planet_1 has a period P1 and Planet_2 has P2 = 3 P1.

So, for each planet, a is given by a^3 = (G M P^2 )/(4 π² )

So a1^3 = (G M1 (P1)^2 )/(4 π² )

a2^3 = (G M2 (P2)^2 )/(4 π² ) = (G M2 (3 P1)^2 )/(4 π² ) = (G M2 9 P1² )/(4 π² )

So a2^3 = 9 M2 / M1 * a1^3, because M2 is M2 and M1 is the mass of the host star of Planet_1.

But wait, in the question, the host of Planet_1 has a mass twice that of Planet_2's host. So M1 = 2 M2.

So substituting M1 = 2 M2, then a2^3 = 9 (M2) / (2 M2) * a1^3 = (9/2) a1^3.

So a2^3 = (9/2) a1^3 → a2 = a1 * (9/2)^(1/3)

Compute (9/2)^(1/3): 9 is 3^2, 2 is 2^1. So 9/2 = 4.5. So cube root of 4.5 is about 1.65, since 1.65^3 is approx 4.49 (since 1.6^3=4.096, 1.65^3=4.49, 1.7^3=4.913). So a2 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So a2 is about 1.65 times a1.

Now, the transit probability is proportional to R_* / a.

But wait, the stars have the same radius, R1 = R2 = R.

So for Planet_1, transit probability is P1 = R / a1

For Planet_2, P2 = R / a2 = R / (1.65 a1) = (1 / 1.65) * (R/a1) ≈ 0.606 * (R/a1) → so P2 is about 0.606 times P1.

Wait, that would mean Planet_1 has a higher probability. But the options suggest otherwise. Wait, but I thought Planet_1 is closer, so higher probability.

Wait, but wait, what about the mass and the period relation again. Because the host star of Planet_1 is more massive, so for the same period, the planet would be closer. But in this case, the periods are different: P1 is shorter than P2.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the a's more accurately.

Let me write the Kepler's third law correctly.

The formula is a^3 = [G(M_star + m_planet) P^2]/(4 π^2 )

But since M_star >> m_planet, we can ignore m_planet. So,

a^3 = (G M_star P^2 )/(4 π^2 )

Therefore, a ∝ (M_star * P^2 )^(1/3 )

So for each planet:

a1 = [ (G M1 P1^2 )/(4 π^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ (G M2 P2^2 )/(4 π^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

Given that P2 = 3 P1, and M1 = 2 M2.

Substituting:

a2 = [ (G (2 M2) (3 P1)^2 )/(4 π^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, no:

Wait, M1 is the mass of Planet_1's star, which is twice Planet_2's star mass. So, M1=2 M2.

So a2 is for Planet_2, which has P2=3 P1.

So,

a2 = [ (G * M2 * (3 P1)^2 )/(4 π^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

a1 = [ (G * 2 M2 * P1^2 )/(4 π^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

So, let's take the ratio a2/a1.

a2/a1 = [ (G M2 (9 P1²) ) / ( G (2 M2) P1² ) ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify the terms inside:

= [ (9 M2 P1²) / (2 M2 P1²) ) ]^(1/3 )

M2 cancels, P1² cancels.

= [ 9 / 2 ) ]^(1/3 )

Which is (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65.

So a2 = 1.65 a1.

So, a1 is smaller than a2.

So, the transit probability P is proportional to R_* / a.

Since R_* is the same for both, P1 = R / a1, P2 = R / a2.

So P2 = (R / a2) = R/(1.65 a1) = (1/1.65) (R/a1) = 0.606 P1.

So P1 is about 1.65 times higher than P2.

Wait, so Planet_1 has a higher probability.

Looking back at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to 1.65 times higher probability. Option D says 2.7 times.

Wait, but my calculation says P1 is about 1.65 times P2. So Planet_1 is better, so the researchers would prefer Planet_1, which is option C or D.

Wait, let me double-check. Because P_transit of Planet_1 is (R/a1), and P_transit of Planet_2 is (R/a2) = (R)/(1.65 a1) = (1/1.65) (R/a1) ≈ 0.606 (R/a1). So P1 is (R/a1) vs. P2 is 0.606 (R/a1). So P1 is higher by a factor of about 1.65.

So the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times that of Planet_2. So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1 because it has a higher probability. Therefore, the correct option should be C or D.

Wait, but looking at the options:

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher.

So according to my calculation, C is correct.

But wait, another thought: did I make a mistake in the Kepler's law application?

Wait, perhaps I should redo the calculation step by step.

We have:

a1^3 = (G M1 P1^2 )/(4 π² )

a2^3 = (G M2 P2^2 )/(4 π² )

Given M1=2 M2, P2=3 P1.

So, substituting:

a2^3 = ( G (2 M2) (3 P1)^2 ) / (4 π² )

Wait no, wait. Wait, M2 is the mass of Planet_2's host, and M1 is 2 M2.

So, a1^3 = (G (2 M2) P1^2 ) / (4 π² )

a2^3 = (G M2 (3 P1)^2 ) / (4 π² )

So, a2^3 = ( G M2 9 P1² ) / (4 π² )

So,

a2^3 / a1^3 = [ (9 M2 P1² ) / (4 π² ) ] / [ (2 M2 P1² ) / (4 π² ) ) ]

The numerator is (9 M2 P1² ), denominator is (2 M2 P1² ). So the ratio is 9/2=4.5.

So (a2/a1)^3 = 4.5 → a2/a1 = cube root of 4.5 ≈ 1.65.

So a2 = 1.65 a1.

Thus, R/a for a2 is R/(1.65 a1), which is 0.606 (R/a1), so P2 is 0.606 P1.

So the probability of transit for Planet_1 is about 1.65 times higher than Planet_2.

Thus, the researchers should prefer Planet_1, option C.

Wait, but the options have option C as 1.65 times higher, which matches. So the correct answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( P_{\text{transit}} \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \). A smaller \( a \) increases the transit probability.

### Step 1: Relating Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis
Using Kepler's Third Law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the mass of the host star \( M_* \) as:
\[
a^3 \propto M_* P^2
\]
For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period (\( P_1 \)) and a host star with mass \( M_1 = 2M_2 \), where \( M_2 \) is the mass of Planet_2's host star.
- Planet_2 has a longer orbital period (\( P_2 = 3P_1 \)) and a host star with mass \( M_2 \).

Substituting these values:
\[
\frac{a_2^3}{a_1^3} = \frac{M_2 P_2^2}{M_1 P_1^2} = \frac{M_2 (3P_1)^2}{2M_2 P_1^2} = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5
\]
Taking the cube root:
\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \sqrt[3]{4.5} \approx 1.65
\]
Thus, \( a_2 \approx 1.65a_1 \).

### Step 2: Transit Probability Comparison
The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \). For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
\[
P_{\text{transit,1}} \propto \frac{R_*}{a_1}, \quad P_{\text{transit,2}} \propto \frac{R_*}{a_2}
\]
Substituting \( a_2 = 1.65a_1 \):
\[
\frac{P_{\text{transit,2}}}{P_{\text{transit,1}}} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_2}}{\frac{R_*}{a_1}} = \frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{1}{1.65} \approx 0.606
\]
This means Planet_1 has a transit probability approximately 1.65 times higher than Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1. The correct option is:

**C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**
