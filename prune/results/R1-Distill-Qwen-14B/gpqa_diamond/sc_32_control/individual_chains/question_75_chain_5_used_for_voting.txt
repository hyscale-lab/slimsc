Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and genetics. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down.

Alright, the question is about creating a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein. The researcher is trying to see if this protein has a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They modified the gene by adding the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. They used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, but they're unable to overexpress the protein as expected. So, the problem is in the construct they made.

The provided sequence is the plus strand of their construct. They noticed something wrong in the sequence, and the options suggest different possibilities for why the protein isn't being expressed.

Let me look at the options:

Option A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. Hmm. That would mean the HA tag is wrong. But would that prevent the protein from being expressed? Maybe if it's in the start codon or something. I'm not sure yet.

Option B) The ribosome terminated the translation early. That would mean a premature stop codon. How would that happen? Maybe if there's a stop codon introduced in the sequence.

Option C) The lack of a linker sequence is causing proteolysis. A linker would prevent the protein from being broken down by proteases, perhaps. If the HA tag is right after the start, maybe without a linker, the protein is being degraded. But I'm not sure how the sequence would look.

Option D) The tRNA for the UAA codon doesn't exist in the mouse. Wait, UAA is a stop codon. If the construct has a UAA, but the mouse's tRNA can't recognize it, that would cause a problem. But wait, UAA is a standard stop codon. I think all cells have tRNA that recognize stop codons, so maybe that's not the issue. Unless it's a readthrough or something.

Wait, the sequence is provided. Let me look at it. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then there's a bunch of nucleotides. Let me scan for stop codons. Stop codons are UAA, UAG, UGA. Looking through the sequence, searching for those.

Looking at the sequence:

The sequence starts with ATG, so that's methionine. Let me look for the UAA, UAG, or UGA.

Looking for UAA: Let's see... The sequence is all in uppercase letters, so let's look for 'TAA' in the DNA because DNA is complementary to mRNA. Wait, mRNA is made from the DNA template, so the mRNA would have U where the DNA has T. So in the DNA, a stop codon would be TAA (since mRNA is UAA), TAG (DNA is ATG), or TGA (DNA is TCA? Wait, wait, no. Let me think. DNA is double-stranded, and mRNA is synthesized from the template strand. So the coding strand is the same as mRNA except T becomes U.

Wait, in the plus strand (coding strand), the sequence is 5' to 3' and matches the mRNA except T instead of U. So a stop codon in the mRNA would come from the DNA as the same triplet but with T instead of U. So UAA in mRNA is TAA in DNA. Similarly, UAG is TAG, and UGA is TGA in DNA.

So looking through the provided plus strand sequence for TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Looking at the sequence line by line:

5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA in this string.

Let me scan:

The entire sequence is quite long. Let's look for any occurrence.

Looking for TAA:
- I see 'TAC' early on, but that's TAC, which is tyrosine. Then 'TCC', 'TAG' anywhere? Hmm. Let me look again.

Wait, part of the sequence: ...CTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA...

Looking for TAG or TGA. Let's see:

- There's a 'CATTTTACGCT' which has TACGCT. Not seeing any TAG or TGA.

Wait, the sequence ends with 'GAGTGA'. Let me check the end: '...GAGTGA3' — that's GAG TGA. So in the DNA, the last part is GAGTGA. So in DNA, that's the sequence for the last few codons.

Wait, DNA is read in triplets. Let me see the last part: 'GAGTGA3'. So that's GAG TGA. In mRNA, that would be GAG UGA. So the last codon is UGA, which is a stop codon.

Oh! So the DNA has a TGA, which is a stop codon in the mRNA. So the sequence includes a UGA stop codon at the end.

So the construct has a UGA (TGA in DNA) as the last codon. That would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early.

So why would that be a problem? Because the plasmid was designed to overexpress the protein, but if there's a stop codon, the protein would be truncated. Oh but wait, the plus strand is the coding strand, so the mRNA is synthesized from the template (non-coding) strand, so the sequence provided is the same as the mRNA except T→U. So the plus strand has the coding sequence.

So the last part is GAGTGA. So that's codon 1: GAG (glu), codon 2: TGA (stop). So the mRNA would end with GAG UGA. So the protein would stop at that point, making it shorter than expected.

Wait, but in the question, the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed. So if the gene has a stop codon, then the protein would be shorter. But the researcher might not see any band if the stop is before the HA tag, but depends where it is.

Wait, looking at the construct: the HA tag is at the N-terminus. So the start is ATG (so the HA tag comes after that, as it's the N-terminus). The HA tag is part of the coding sequence. If the stop codon is at the end, the HA tag should be expressed, but the rest of the GADD45G wouldn't. But why would the HA tag not be expressed? Or maybe the problem is that the entire protein isn't expressed.

Wait, but the construct is for GADD45G with the HA tag. If the stop codon is at the end, the protein would be expressed up to that point. Maybe the HA tag is at the beginning, so the protein would be HA-GADD45G but cut short. But the issue is that the protein isn't overexpressed—so perhaps it's not being made at all. Or maybe it's made but quickly degraded.

Wait, but the given DNA sequence has a stop codon at the end. So the protein would be expressed but truncated. So why isn't it expressed? Or maybe the construct is not being correctly expressed because of the stop codon.

Wait, but the construct is designed to overexpress the GADD45G gene. So perhaps the presence of a stop codon in the middle (or end) would cause the protein to be truncated and maybe not functional, but the plasmid would still produce the protein, just shorter.

But the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed as expected. So maybe the construct has an early stop codon, preventing the full-length protein from being made.

Looking back at the options:

Option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would happen if there's a premature stop codon. So if the construct has a stop codon in the middle, the protein would be shorter than intended.

Wait, but in the given sequence, the stop codon is at the very end. So perhaps the HA tag is correctly added, and the GADD45G is expressed but ends prematurely. So the protein would be HA-tagged but shorter than normal. So why isn't it being overexpressed?

Alternatively, perhaps the construct includes a stop codon after the HA tag but before the GADD45G sequence. But I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, another thought: the plasmid for expression would usually have a Kozak sequence or certain elements to allow proper initiation of translation. But I'm not sure that's the issue here.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the HA tag is causing a problem. But the construct includes that. The sequence starts with ATG, then the HA tag.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is causing a frameshift. If the HA tag's coding sequence introduces a stop codon, that would cause a problem. Let me think about that.

The HA tag is a short peptide, so its coding sequence is probably about 10-15 amino acids. Let's say the HA tag is something like YPYDVPDYA. That's 9 amino acids, so about 27 nucleotides. So the HA coding sequence would come after the ATG. Let me check the beginning of the sequence.

Looking at the beginning: ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

So the first part is ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus. So the first part is the HA coding sequence, then the GADD45G. But perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence was added in a way that caused a frame shift. But the HA tag is a known sequence, so that's unlikely.

Wait, but the issue is that the protein isn't overexpressed. So perhaps the construct has an early stop codon. Let me look in the middle for any TAA, TAG, TGA.

Wait, in the middle I see 'TGA' perhaps? Let me check.

Looking through the sequence again:

- ...GGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA...

Hmm, I don't see any early stop codons. Wait, the very end is ...GAGTGA. So that's the last codons. So the last codon is TGA (from DNA), which is a stop in mRNA as UGA.

So the entire GADD45G coding sequence ends with UGA. That means the protein would be shorter—it would stop at that point. But why would the protein not be overexpressed?

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is at the N-terminus, and the UGA comes after that. So the HA would be expressed, but the rest of GADD45G wouldn't. So the HA would be present but not attached to the rest of the protein. Or perhaps the HA is part of the GADD45G construct, so the stop codon is after the HA.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the construct includes a termination codon in the middle, causing a truncated protein. But according to the sequence, the only stop is at the end.

Wait, but maybe the construct is designed to have a Kozak sequence or something that the ribosome needs to initiate. If the construct doesn't have the proper initiation context, the ribosome might not start, hence no protein.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the stop codon is in the middle of the HA tag, making the HA tag incomplete. But the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus, so if the stop is in the HA, the protein would be very short.

Wait, the HA tag is a short peptide, right? So the HA coding sequence is probably only about 9 amino acids. Let me check the beginning of the DNA sequence. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then the next part would be the HA coding.

Looking at the first few codons:
ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTC CGC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC A...

Wait, if the HA is the first part, the first codon is ATG (methionine, start). Then TAC (tyrosine), CCC (proline), ATA (isoleucine), CGA (arginine), TGT (cysteine), TCC (serine), AGA (arginine), TTA (leucine), CGC (arg), CAA (glu), ATG (start... again?), but wait, that can't be right.

Wait, maybe the HA tag is encoded by the first few codons. Let me think about the HA epitope. The HA tag is usually something like YPYDVPDYA. Let's see, in one-letter code, that's Y P Y D V P D Y A. So that's 9 amino acids.

Translating the first 9 codons:

ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA

ATG = Met

TAC = Tyr

CCC = Pro

ATA = Ile

CGA = Arg

TGT = Cys

TCC = Ser

AGA = Arg

TTA = Leu

So the amino acids would be Met Tyr Pro Ile Arg Cys Ser Arg Leu. That's nothing like the HA tag. So perhaps the HA tag is not correctly added, leading to a frame shift or incorrect sequence.

Wait, but the HA is supposed to be at the N-terminus. So if the HA coding sequence is messed up, perhaps the translated protein would have the wrong amino acids, leading to no proper HA epitope. But in the question, the issue is that the protein isn't overexpressed, not that the HA isn't recognized.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is causing a premature stop codon. But the HA is only 9 amino acids, so if the HA's coding sequence has a stop codon, that would truncate the protein early.

Wait, let me check the HA coding sequence.

HA is, as I said, about 9 amino acids. Let's see the first 9 codons:

1. ATG (start)
2. TAC (Tyr)
3. CCC (Pro)
4. ATA (Ile)
5. CGA (Arg)
6. TGT (Cys)
7. TCC (Ser)
8. AGA (Arg)
9. TTA (Leu)

No stop codon here. So the HA would be expressed, but perhaps the rest of the GADD45G is not because of a stop codon elsewhere.

Wait, but the only stop codon in the entire sequence is at the very end. So the HA would be expressed, and then the rest of GADD45G would be expressed until the end. But the researcher isn't seeing overexpression. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the stop codon is at the end, but the plasmid is designed for expression without a stop. So the construct includes a TGA (UGA in mRNA) at the end, which may not be a problem, but perhaps the problem is that the HA tag is causing a frameshift or something.

Wait, or perhaps the HA tag isn't followed correctly, leading to a missing start codon for the GADD45G. Let me think: the HA is at the N-terminus, so it's part of the same reading frame as GADD45G. So the entire coding sequence is in frame.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the HA tag isn't followed by the correct start codon for GADD45G. Wait, but the HA is just a tag, so it should be in frame with the GADD45G.

Alternatively, maybe the HA tag's coding sequence includes a stop codon. Let me check the first 9 codons again.

No, they don't. So perhaps the issue is something else.

Wait, the question says that the researcher introduced a sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus. So the HA tag is added before the GADD45G coding sequence.

So the construct should be HA-tagged GADD45G, but in the provided DNA sequence, the HA is part of the coding sequence. So the entire coding sequence is HA followed by GADD45G.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is in the wrong frame, causing the GADD45G to be out of frame, leading to a premature stop. But wait, the DNA sequence is provided as the plus strand, so it should be in the correct frame.

Alternatively, maybe the HA tag's sequence was incorrectly inserted, adding extra nucleotides that cause a frameshift. But if that's the case, the entire sequence after would be wrong, leading to a premature stop.

Wait, but in the given DNA sequence, the only stop codon is at the very end. So why is the protein not being expressed?

Another possibility: the presence of the HA tag introduces a stop codon in the mRNA, such as a UAA, UAG, or UGA, which would cause the ribosome to terminate early. Let me think: perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence includes a stop codon.

But looking at the first 9 codons, which are the HA, I don't see any stop codons.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag isn't correctly inserted, and the start codon is missing, so the ribosome doesn't start translating.

Looking at the start: the first codon is ATG, which is correct. So the start is fine.

Alternatively, maybe the sequence after the HA tag is causing a problem. Let's say the HA is correctly made, but the rest of the GADD45G is missing or not correctly expressed. But the stop codon is at the end, so it should allow the HA to be expressed along with the GADD45G.

Wait, perhaps the plasmid doesn't have a poly-A tail or other elements necessary for mRNA stability, but that's not part of the question's options.

Looking back at the options, let's go through each:

Option A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. That would mean the HA is wrong, but the protein would still be expressed. So why would the protein not be overexpressed? Maybe the HA is recognized by the immune system, but the construct's issue is expression. So perhaps the HA mutation doesn't affect expression. So maybe this isn't the right option.

Option B) The ribosome terminated the translation early. That would be if there's a premature stop codon. But in the given sequence, the only stop is at the end. Unless I missed an earlier one. Let me re-examine.

Wait, looking again for TGA or other stop codons in DNA:

Looking for TGA.

The plus strand sequence: ...ACTGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA...

Wait, the part after GTGCGCGTGGGCGAT is GTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, looking for TGA. I see 'TGA' at the very end: GAGTGA. So that's GAG TGA.

So the last codon (in mRNA) is UGA, which is a stop codon. So the protein would be HA-GADD45G, but the GADD45G portion would stop early because of the UGA.

So the GADD45G would be shorter than normal, but the HA would be present. But why isn't the protein overexpressed? Maybe the HA tag is causing the protein to be recognized as foreign and degraded by proteasomes, but that's more of a problem with detection, not expression levels.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the HA tag and the stop codon at the end is causing the ribosome to terminate early, resulting in a truncated protein that's not functional. But the question is about overexpression, so perhaps the protein is not being produced in sufficient quantities.

Wait, another thought: when you have a stop codon at the end of the coding sequence, the ribosome terminates, and the mRNA is typically subject to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). NMD is a cellular quality control mechanism that degrades mRNA with premature stop codons. So if the construct's mRNA has a stop codon at the end, perhaps the cell's NMD machinery degrades the mRNA, leading to low levels of the HA-GADD45G protein.

But wait, in this case, the stop codon is at the end of the gene. Nonsense-mediated decay usually targets mRNA with premature stop codons, meaning stops that occur in the middle, leading to truncated proteins. If the stop is exactly at the end, perhaps NMD isn't triggered, but perhaps the mRNA is still being translated.

But why would that prevent expression? If the mRNA is translated, the protein would be made but shorter. But if the mRNA is unstable because of NMD, then less protein is made.

Wait, but in the case where the stop codon is at the natural end of the gene, the presence of a poly-A tail and other elements should prevent NMD. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the GADD45G coding sequence ends with a stop codon, making the mRNA not have any downstream exons, which is a signal for NMD. Wait, I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate early. Let me look at the HA coding sequence to see if it includes a stop codon.

The HA coding sequence is the first 9 codons:

ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA

Which translates to Met Tyr Pro Ile Arg Cys Ser Arg Leu.

No stop codons here.

So, the HA is correctly expressed, then the GADD45G starts. The only stop codon is at the very end.

Wait, the problem is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. So why would that be?

Looking at the options again, option B says the ribosome terminated early, which would happen if a premature stop codon exists. But according to the sequence, the only stop is at the end. So perhaps the issue is not a premature stop.

Wait, could it be that the HA tag's sequence isn't followed by the correct start codon for the GADD45G? No, because the HA is part of the same reading frame. The start is ATG, then HA, then GADD45G.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is causing a problem with the cloning vector, such as inserting it in the wrong orientation. But the setup says the HA is at the N-terminus, so the construct should be in the correct orientation.

Hmm, another thought: perhaps the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate because it's not followed by the correct Kozak sequence or other initiation elements. But the HA is just a tag; the start codon is correct.

Wait, maybe the issue is that the HA tag's sequence includes a stop codon in the frame, but as we saw earlier, it doesn't.

Wait, let me think again about the options. The question is why the protein isn't overexpressed.

Option C says the lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. So without a linker between HA and GADD45G, the protein might be cleaved. But the HA tag is at the N-terminus. If the HA is present but the GADD45G is cleaved, maybe the protein is not detected because the tag is lost. But the researcher is using affinity purification for the HA tag. If the HA is intact, the protein should be pulled down, but if it's cleaved, perhaps the HA is lost.

But the construct is designed to have the HA at the N-terminus, so the GADD45G is after it. If the HA is cleaved, the GADD45G would be lost. But why would the HA be cleaved? Maybe the lack of a linker allows proteases to cleave between HA and GADD45G.

But according to the given sequence, the HA is in frame, so without a linker, maybe the protease recognizes a site between them, leading to cleavage. That could prevent the GADD45G from being expressed as a fusion protein, hence no overexpression.

But how does that relate to the sequence provided? The sequence includes the HA coding followed by GADD45G. So if a linker is missing, perhaps the HA is directly attached to GADD45G, making a longer peptide that's more prone to proteolysis.

Wait, but the question says that the HA is at the N-terminus, so the sequence is correct. So the issue is whether the HA is causing the protein to be recognized for degradation. But the given options don't mention anything about the HA causing degradation; option C is about the lack of linker.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA is causing the ribosome to terminate because it's not in frame. Wait, the HA is in the correct frame, so that's not it.

Wait, another thought: the HA tag might have a stop codon in a different reading frame. But the HA is in the same frame as the GADD45G, so any stop would cause the whole thing to terminate. But in the sequence, the HA's part doesn't have a stop.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop codon in the HA is causing the ribosome to terminate early. But the HA doesn't have any stop codons.

Wait, perhaps the plasmid doesn't have a promoter or other regulatory elements, but the setup says it's an inducible overexpression construct, so the regulatory elements should be present.

Looking at the options again, perhaps option B is correct because the stop codon is at the end. But wait, the stop is at the end, so the mRNA would be translated correctly. So why isn't the protein being expressed?

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's sequence introduces a secondary structure that prevents the ribosome from translating past it, causing the ribosome to stall. But that's more of a translational issue, and the question states that the problem is in the DNA sequence.

Wait, looking again, the only stop codon is at the end. So the protein should be expressed, but perhaps the HA is causing the ribosome to terminate early. But the HA doesn't have any stop codons.

Wait, perhaps the GADD45G coding sequence has a stop codon in the middle that wasn't supposed to be there. But in the provided sequence, I don't see any. Only at the end.

Wait, perhaps the issue is not with the stop codon, but with the start codon. Let me check the beginning. The construct starts with ATG, which is correct. So that's not the problem.

Another possibility: the construct includes a poly-A signal before the end, causing the mRNA to be prematurely polyadenylated and terminated. But that's not part of the given options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag's sequence has a premature stop codon, but as we saw, it doesn't. So perhaps the issue is with the plasmid's origin of replication or selection markers. But the question says the researcher selected for antibiotic resistance, so that's not it.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me re-examine the options.

Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse.

Wait, UAA is a stop codon. All cells have release factors that recognize stop codons; they don't rely on specific tRNAs. So this option is incorrect because there's no tRNA for stop codons. The release factor recognizes the stop codon and terminates translation regardless of tRNA presence.

So option D is incorrect.

Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis.

If there's no linker, the HA tag is directly attached to GADD45G. Proteases might cleave at the HA site, leading to degradation of the protein. But in the given sequence, the HA is part of the same reading frame, so the protein is HA-GADD45G. Without a linker, perhaps the HA is exposed and recognized by proteases, leading to degradation. That would explain why the protein isn't overexpressed; the nascent chain is being degraded.

So in this case, the HA is present, but the protein is quickly broken down because there's no linker to protect it from proteolysis. So the protein levels are low, making it appear as if overexpression isn't happening.

But the option says the lack of linker is causing proteolysis. So perhaps that's the issue.

But how does that relate to the given DNA sequence? The plus strand doesn't have anything about linkers. The issue is that the DNA construct doesn't include a linker between HA and GADD45G, leading to proteolysis.

So the problem is that the HA is right before GADD45G without a linker, causing the protein to be cleaved. Thus, the HA is present, but the rest is cleaved, so the fusion protein isn't formed, leading to no overexpression.

But the question states that the researcher noticed an issue in the sequence. So perhaps the sequence has a problem that makes the HA-GADD45G not being expressed.

Wait, but the given sequence does include the HA coding before the GADD45G. So the lack of a linker would be a design issue, not a sequence issue. But the question says the researcher noticed the problem in the sequence. So perhaps the sequence is missing something.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence includes a stop codon, but we don't see any in the first 9 codons.

Alternatively, perhaps the lack of a linker is causing the ribosome to terminate. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag's coding sequence is not followed by the correct start codon for the GADD45G. But that's not the case here because the HA is part of the same ORF.

Hmm. This is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about the options again.

If the HA is correctly added but the stop codon is at the end, the protein would be HA-GADD45G, but perhaps the HA is causing the ribosome to terminate early. But the HA doesn't have a stop. Alternatively, perhaps the HA is causing a frame shift, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's sequence includes a stop codon in a different reading frame, but the ribosome is in the correct frame. So that wouldn't cause a problem.

Another thought: perhaps the HA tag's sequence includes a cryptic promoter or something that's causing transcription issues. But that's not part of the options.

Wait, given the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. If the stop codon is at the end, then the ribosome wouldn't terminate early. So perhaps option B is not the answer.

Wait, maybe the construct doesn't include the entire GADD45G gene, but only a part of it. But the question says the coding sequence is introduced, so the HA is followed by the entire GADD45G coding.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the HA's coding sequence includes a stop codon in the reverse complement. But I don't think that's the issue.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is in the wrong phase, causing a frameshift. But the HA is added at the N-terminus in frame, so that shouldn't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's sequence includes a stop codon when read in the reverse. But as we've seen, it doesn't.

Wait, perhaps the researcher forgot to include the HA tag's sequence in the correct reading frame, causing a frameshift. But in that case, the entire sequence after would be incorrectly read, leading to a premature stop. But the given sequence only has a stop at the end, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's sequence was incorrectly inserted in the wrong reading frame, leading to a frameshift and an early stop. For example, if the HA was inserted in a different frame, the reading frame would shift, and a stop codon would occur early.

But the HA's sequence is in the same frame as the start codon. The HA is part of the same ORF, so the frame is correct.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the HA's sequence introduces a stop codon when read in the complementary strand, but that's irrelevant because the coding strand is the one that matters.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let's try to think about the options again.

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. So the HA is wrong. But the problem is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. A mutation in the HA wouldn't prevent the protein from being made; it just changes the epitope. So I don't think this is the cause of the lack of expression.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would require a premature stop codon in the mRNA. The given sequence only has a stop codon at the end, so the ribosome would terminate at the end. So why isn't the protein expressed? Unless the stop is in the middle, which it isn't.

Option C: Lack of linker causing proteolysis. If the HA is directly before GADD45G with no linker, proteases could cleave between them, leading to degradation. But the question is about the construct's DNA sequence. If the DNA doesn't have a linker, then the protein would be HA-GADD45G without a linker, making it more susceptible to proteolysis. So the protein would be expressed but quickly degraded, leading to low levels. Therefore, the researcher wouldn't see overexpression.

But in that case, the problem is a design issue in the construct (lack of linker), not a problem in the DNA sequence. But the question says the researcher noticed the issue in the sequence. So perhaps the sequence has a problem that makes the linker absent, but that's not clear.

Wait, the question says the researcher modified the gene by introducing the HA sequence. So perhaps the HA was inserted without a linker, which is a design choice, not a sequence error. So the problem is C, the lack of linker leading to proteolysis.

But the question says the researcher noticed the problem in the sequence of the plus strand. So perhaps the sequence is missing a linker. But the provided sequence includes the HA coding and GADD45G coding, so I don't see any missing linker.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence doesn't include a linker. No, the linker is a short amino acid sequence, not part of the DNA in this case.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's sequence was inserted in the correct frame but without a proper Kozak sequence or initiation context, leading to poor translation efficiency. But the construct starts with ATG, which is the start codon, so that's correct.

Another possibility: the HA tag's sequence introduces a secondary structure that prevents the ribosome from initiating or progressing. But again, that's a translational issue, not a problem seen in the DNA sequence.

Wait, going back to option B. If the ribosome is terminating early, but the only stop codon is at the end, perhaps the issue is that the stop codon is in the middle. But in the given sequence, it's only at the end. So perhaps the problem is not in the coding sequence but elsewhere, like the promoter or other regulatory regions. But the question states that the problem is in the sequence they provided.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's sequence includes a stop codon when read in the mRNA, but in DNA, it's not a stop. Let me think. For example, in the DNA, the HA coding sequence might have a TAA, which in mRNA is UAA, a stop. But in the given sequence, the HA is:

ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ...

Wait, the fourth codon is ATA (Ile), then CGA (Arg), then TGT (Cys), TCC (Ser), AGA (Arg), TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), CAA (Glu), ATG (start again? No, can't be. Wait, that's the coding sequence.

Looking at the first 9 codons:

1. ATG (Met)
2. TAC (Tyr)
3. CCC (Pro)
4. ATA (Ile)
5. CGA (Arg)
6. TGT (Cys)
7. TCC (Ser)
8. AGA (Arg)
9. TTA (Leu)

No stop codons here.

Wait, but the 9th codon is TTA (Leu). So HA is Met Tyr Pro Ile Arg Cys Ser Arg Leu. So no stop. So the HA is correctly expressed, and the GADD45G follows.

The only stop codon is at the end. So the HA-GADD45G is expressed, but the GADD45G is shorter.

But why isn't the protein overexpressed? Maybe the shorter protein is not recognized by the antibody used for detection, but the question is about the expression level, not detection.

Alternatively, perhaps the shorter protein is not functional, but the issue is expression, not function.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the HA tag's sequence includes a stop codon in the reverse complement. But that's irrelevant because mRNA is synthesized from the coding strand.

Wait, perhaps the HA's coding sequence includes a stop codon in the plus strand, but that's not the case.

I'm a bit stuck. Based on the options, which one makes the most sense.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. If the stop codon was in the middle, the protein would be truncated. But the stop is at the end.

Option C: No linker causing proteolysis. If the HA is directly before GADD45G, the protein might be cleaved, leading to lower levels. But why would the sequence show this? It wouldn't. It's a design issue, not a sequence issue.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the HA's coding sequence has a stop codon in a different reading frame, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the HA's coding sequence introduces a frameshift, leading to a stop codon in the GADD45G. But if the HA is in frame, that shouldn't happen.

Wait, the HA is 9 amino acids, which is 27 nucleotides. So the HA's coding sequence would be 27 nucleotides, which is 9 codons.

Wait, in the given sequence, the HA is followed by the rest of the GADD45G. So the entire coding sequence is in frame.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options again.

Option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would require a premature stop codon. But in the given sequence, the only stop is at the end. So perhaps option B is incorrect.

Option C is about proteolysis due to a lack of linker. That's a possibility, but it's a design issue, not a sequence error. The question says the researcher noticed the problem in the construct's sequence, so perhaps the sequence is missing a linker. But the given sequence doesn't show that.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence is causing the ribosome to terminate early. But as we've checked, it doesn't have any stop codons.

Hmm. I'm going to have to make an educated guess. The presence of a stop codon at the end would cause the protein to terminate, but that's a natural termination. The other possibility is that the HA tag's coding sequence includes a stop codon, but it doesn't.

Wait, another thought: the HA tag's coding sequence might have a stop codon if read in the opposite direction, but that's irrelevant because the coding sequence is in the correct direction.

Wait, perhaps the HA's coding sequence includes a stop codon when read in the complementary strand. But that's not how mRNA is read. The mRNA is synthesized from the template strand, which is complementary to the coding strand.

Wait, perhaps the HA's coding sequence has a stop codon in the template strand, but that's the non-coding strand. The coding strand has the same sequence as mRNA.

Wait, unless the HA's coding sequence has a stop codon in the template strand, which would make it a start codon in the coding strand. But that's not the case here.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Based on the available options, the most likely answer is B: the ribosome terminated early, implying a premature stop codon. But according to the sequence, the only stop is at the end. So perhaps the question implies that the HA tag's coding sequence contains a stop codon, but I don't see it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the sequence. Let me re-examine the beginning.

Sequence starts with ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTC CGC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC A...

Wait, the 10th codon is ATG, which is another start codon. Oh! That's a problem. Because after the HA, the sequence has another ATG, which would cause a new start, leading to a frameshift or a completely different reading frame.

Wait, so the first nine codons are:

1. ATG (Met)
2. TAC (Tyr)
3. CCC (Pro)
4. ATA (Ile)
5. CGA (Arg)
6. TGT (Cys)
7. TCC (Ser)
8. AGA (Arg)
9. TTA (Leu)
10. CGC (Arg)
11. CAA (Glu)
12. ATG (Met)
...

Wait, the 12th codon is ATG, which is another start. So after the HA, there's another ATG, which may cause the ribosome to restart translation, leading to a frameshift or a truncated protein.

Wait, that could cause a problem. Because the ribosome would have translated the HA, then encountered the second ATG, which might cause it to terminate the current peptide and start a new one. But that's not how ribosomes work; they typically don't restart unless there's a uORF or something.

Alternatively, the second ATG would be read as a new start, leading to a different reading frame. But that depends on whether the ribosome is in the same frame.

Wait, the ribosome reads codons in triplets. So after the HA's 9 codons (27 nt), the next codon is CGC (Arg), then CAA (Glu), then ATG (Met). So the 12th codon is ATG, which is a start. So the ribosome might terminate the current translation at the first ATG, then start a new peptide from the second ATG.

But wait, the first ATG is the start, then the HA is 9 codons, then the 12th codon is another ATG. So the ribosome would have translated from the first ATG up to the 12th codon, which is another ATG. That would generate a peptide that includes the HA and part of GADD45G up to that point. Then the ribosome would restart at the second ATG, leading to a new peptide.

But this could cause the ribosome to terminate early because the second ATG is in the same frame, leading to a new start. Alternatively, the ribosome might not restart, leading to a longer peptide.

Wait, this depends on the presence of a uORF or other elements. But in most cases, the ribosome would not restart unless there's a uORF. So the presence of a second ATG might cause the ribosome to terminate the current peptide and start a new one, leading to a truncated protein.

So, the presence of a second ATG in the coding sequence could cause the ribosome to terminate early, leading to a truncated protein that's not functional, hence not overexpressed.

So in this case, the problem is that the HA's coding sequence includes an additional ATG, causing a premature start, which might lead to a frameshift or an early stop.

Wait, but the second ATG is in frame. So after the HA, the ribosome continues in the same frame, and the second ATG is just another Met. So the peptide would have Met at that position, but no stop.

Wait, unless the second ATG introduces a frameshift downstream. But that's not the case here because the second ATG is in the same frame.

Hmm. I think I'm overcomplicating this. Based on the options, the most likely answer is option B: the ribosome terminated early due to a premature stop codon. But according to the sequence given, the only stop is at the end. So I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA's coding sequence includes a UAA in the mRNA, which is a stop codon. Looking at the DNA, the HA's coding sequence doesn't have TAA. So that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the HA's coding sequence has a TAG in DNA, which is a stop. Let me check the DNA sequence for TAG.

Looking for TAG in the plus strand:

The sequence is ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Looking for 'TAG' in the DNA: I don't see any. So no stop codon from the HA.

Hmm. I'm going to have to go with the best option I have. The presence of a stop codon at the end might cause NMD if the gene's structure isn't properly terminated. Alternatively, the HA's coding sequence might have a stop codon that I'm not seeing.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the HA's coding sequence includes a stop codon in the mRNA reading frame. Let me think about the first few codons again.

The HA coding sequence is: ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTC CGC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC A...

Wait, the 9th codon is TTA (Leu), then CGC (Arg), CAA (Glu), ATG (Met), ACT (Thr), CTG (Leu), GAA (Glu), GAA (Glu), GTC (Val), CGC (Arg), GGC (Gly), CAG (Gln), GAC (Asp), ACA (Thr), GTT (Val), CCG (Pro), GAA (Glu), AGC (Ser), etc.

So after the HA, the sequence continues with GADD45G. The only stop is at the end.

So, given all that, I think the issue is that the HA's coding sequence introduces a premature stop codon, but I don't see it in the given sequence. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the HA tag causes the ribosome to terminate early due to a frameshift or other issue, but that's not evident.

Given the options, and the fact that the only stop codon is at the end, I think the problem is that the HA's coding sequence includes a stop codon, which I must have missed.

Wait, perhaps the HA's coding sequence has a UAA in the mRNA. Let me look at the DNA for TAA.

Looking for TAA in the DNA:

The sequence is: ...TTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Looking for TAA in the DNA:

- The part after TACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, I see 'TACGCTGA' which is TAC GCT GAT... Not TAA.

Another part: 'GCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTT' — no TAA.

Hmm. I don't see any TAA in the DNA, so no UAA in mRNA.

Wait, perhaps the HA's coding sequence has a UAG (which is a stop), but looking for TAG in DNA.

Looking for TAG:

In the DNA sequence, is there TAG anywhere?

Looking through the sequence, I don't see TAG. So no UAG in mRNA.

Another part: 'GACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA'.

No TAG found.

So the only stop codon is at the end, which is TGA in DNA (UGA in mRNA). So the problem must be something else.

Given all that, I think the most likely answer is option B: the ribosome terminated early. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the construct's HA tag has a mutation leading to a stop codon, but I don't see it.

Alternatively, maybe the HA's coding sequence includes a stop codon in the DNA, but I don't see it. So perhaps the correct answer is option A: the HA has a missense mutation, but that wouldn't prevent expression.

Hmm. I'm stuck, but I'll go with option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying why a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein, modified to include a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus, fails to overexpress the protein. The provided DNA sequence of the construct was analyzed to determine the issue.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**  
   A missense mutation in the HA tag would alter the HA epitope but would not necessarily prevent protein expression. The protein would still be translated, even if the HA tag is mutated. Since the issue is a lack of overexpression, this option is unlikely to be correct.

2. **Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early**  
   Premature termination would occur if there is a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA in mRNA) introduced prematurely in the coding sequence. The provided DNA sequence was analyzed for stop codons. The only stop codon found is at the very end of the sequence (TGA in DNA, UGA in mRNA). This stop codon is at the natural termination site of the GADD45G coding sequence. Therefore, the ribosome would not terminate early, making this option unlikely.

3. **Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**  
   A linker sequence between the HA tag and GADD45G could prevent proteolysis, but the absence of a linker is a design issue, not a sequence error. The provided DNA sequence does not indicate any missing linker, and the question specifies that the issue was noticed in the sequence. Thus, this option does not directly address the problem in the sequence.

4. **Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**  
   Stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) are universally recognized by release factors during translation, and no specific tRNA is required for their decoding. This option is incorrect because the absence of tRNA for stop codons is not a biological mechanism.

### Conclusion:
The analysis of the sequence revealed that the only stop codon is at the end of the coding sequence, which is a natural termination site. None of the options fully explain the lack of overexpression based on the sequence provided. However, the most plausible explanation among the options is **Option B**, as the presence of a stop codon (even at the end) could theoretically affect translation efficiency or lead to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) if the mRNA is misprocessed. Despite this, the sequence does not clearly indicate a premature stop codon, making the reasoning somewhat uncertain.

Answer: B
