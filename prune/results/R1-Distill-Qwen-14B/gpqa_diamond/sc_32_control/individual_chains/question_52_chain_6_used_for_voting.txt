Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's going on.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics, and how dark spots on its surface affect the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that when stars have spots, it changes their overall brightness and temperature, which in turn affects emission lines because of the ionization states of elements.

So the star's parameters are given: 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. But maybe those aren't directly relevant here. The important things are the effective temperatures. When the star isn't spotted, its Teff is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but isn't the spots cooler than the surrounding photosphere? Oh right, spots are darker and cooler regions, so when they cover part of the surface, the average temperature decreases.

The key part is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher, and when it does, it's lower.

They are asking for the factor by which this ratio changes. So I need to find (ratio without spots) divided by (ratio with spots). The ratio is n1/n2, where n1 is the number of atoms in level 1, and n2 is level 2.

Wait, the ratio is observed to decrease when spots are present. So the ratio (n1/n2) is higher when there are no spots and lower when there are spots. So the factor would be (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots. So if the observed ratio goes down by a factor of, say, 4, then the factor would be 4.

In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels, and T is the temperature.

So the ratio R = (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. So the average T is lower. But wait, does the presence of spots affect the overall photospheric temperature, or just the average? Because the spots are cooler, but the rest of the photosphere is at 6000 K? Or is the entire photosphere at 5500 K when the spots are present?

Wait, the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So the average T is 5500 K. But wait, the star's surface isn't uniformly 5500 K. 40% is at a lower temperature (the spots), and the remaining 60% might be at 6000 K. Hmm, but the question says the photospheric effective temperature decreases. But wait, the photosphere itself is at 5500 K, but that doesn't make sense because the spots are cooler. Or perhaps the average Teff is 5500 K overall.

Wait, no. The effective temperature is a measure of the total luminosity. The actual photosphere's temperature varies across the surface. So when 40% of the surface has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K.

But when considering the ratio of Ti atoms, each region (spot and non-spot) has its own temperature. So the photosphere is a mix of regions at 6000 K and the spots at lower temperature. Hmm, but how does that affect the overall ratio of n1/n2 in the photosphere? Because the photosphere is a mix of regions with different temperatures, the level populations might be a weighted average? Or maybe not, because each region emits according to its own conditions, and we see the combined spectrum.

Wait, but the question says that the ratio in the stellar photosphere is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So perhaps the average ratio is calculated based on the average temperature. But that seems odd because the photosphere isn't isothermal. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying things by treating the entire photosphere as being at the average temperature. Though that might not be accurate, but maybe the question wants us to proceed with that assumption.

Wait, no. The problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases, but when the spots are present, the photosphere isn't all at 5500 K. So perhaps the star's photosphere is a mix of regions at 6000 K (60% of the surface) and a cooler temperature (say T_spot, which is lower than 6000 K). But the problem doesn't specify T_spot, only that the overall Teff is 5500 K when 40% is covered by spots.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate what the Teff would be if 40% is at a lower T and 60% at 6000K. Because the effective temperature is the square root of the average of the squares of the flux contributions.

Wait, the effective temperature is determined by the flux. The Stefan-Boltzmann law says that flux is sigma T^4. So the total flux is the sum of the flux from the spotted and non-spotted areas.

Let me denote:

- Fraction of area covered by spots: f = 0.4
- T_spot = ?
- T_unspotted = 6000 K
- Teff (average) when spots are present: T_avg = 5500 K

The flux from the entire star is the sum of the flux from the spots and the flux from the unspotted regions.

The flux from the spots: f * sigma * T_spot^4
Flux from unspotted: (1 - f) * sigma * T_unspotted^4
Total flux: sigma * [ f T_spot^4 + (1 - f) T_unspotted^4 ]

The effective temperature T_eff is given by sigma T_eff^4 = flux, so:

T_eff^4 = f T_spot^4 + (1 - f) T_unspotted^4

We can plug in the numbers:

T_avg = 5500 K, f=0.4, T_unspotted=6000 K.

So,

5500^4 = 0.4 * T_spot^4 + 0.6 * 6000^4

We can solve for T_spot^4.

Calculating:

First compute each term.

5500^4 = (5.5e3)^4 = (5.5)^4 * 1e12 = 5.5^4 is 915.0625, so 9.150625e14.

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 *1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

So,

5500^4 = 9.150625e14
6000^4 =1.296e15

Compute 0.6 * 1.296e15 = 0.7776e15 = 7.776e14.

Then, 5500^4 = 9.150625e14 = 0.4 * T_spot^4 + 7.776e14.

Subtracting: 9.150625e14 - 7.776e14 = 1.374625e14 = 0.4 * T_spot^4.

So T_spot^4 = 1.374625e14 / 0.4 = 3.4365625e14.

Take the fourth root to find T_spot.

Calculate the fourth root of 3.4365625e14.

Hmm, 3.4365625e14 = 3.4365625 * 1e14.

The fourth root of 1e14 is (1e14)^(1/4) = 1e3.5 = approx 3.16e3 = 3160 K.

Wait no, because 1e14 is (1e3.5)^4 = (1e3.5)^4 = 1e14. Because 3.5 *4=14. So 1e3.5 is 3.1623e3 K.

So the fourth root of 3.4365625 is about 1.36, because 1.36^4 is approx 3.43.

Wait, 1.36^2 is about 1.8496, then squared again is about 3.42. So yes, 1.36.

So T_spot^4 = 3.4365625e14 = (1.36e3.5)^4.

Wait, perhaps better to compute T_spot = (3.4365625e14)^(1/4).

Wait, 3.4365625e14 = 3.4365625 * 1e14.

The fourth root of 1e14 is (1e14)^(1/4) = (1e3.5 )= approx 3.1623e3 K. Because (1e3)^4 is 1e12, (1e4)^4 is 1e16. So 1e14 is 1e3.5.

So 1e3.5 is 3162.27766 K.

So for the value 3.4365625e14, the fourth root is (3.4365625)^(1/4) multiplied by 1e3.5.

3.4365625 is approximately 3.4366. The fourth root of that is roughly 1.36, because 1.36^4 is about 3.428, close to 3.4366. So approx 1.36.

So T_spot = 1.36 * 3162.27766 K ≈ 4317 K. Hmm, but wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, let me compute (3.4365625e14)^(1/4) = (3.4365625)^(1/4) * (1e14)^(1/4) = (approx 1.36) * 3162 K ≈ 4317 K.

Wait, that's the spot temperature? 4317 K. That seems quite cool, but maybe that's correct.

So now, without spots, the entire star is at 6000 K. With spots, 40% is at 4317 K, and 60% at 6000 K.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the observed ratio (n1/n2) in the photosphere is lower. How does this happen?

Well, in LTE, the ratio of populations depends on the local temperature. So for each region (spot and non-spot), the ratio is calculated using their respective T.

But when the star has spots, the observed ratio is a sort of average between the two regions.

Wait, but how is the ratio observed? Are we looking at the equivalent width of the lines, which would depend on the number of absorbers in each region? Or is it a simple average?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the average temperature of the photosphere when spots are present. Wait, the effective temperature is 5500 K, but each region has its own temperature.

Wait, but the question states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the photosphere as a whole is at 5500 K, but that's not physically accurate because the spots are cooler. Hmm, maybe the question is simplifying and treating the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present. Then, without spots, it's at 6000 K.

But wait, when the star has spots, the actual photosphere is a mix of 6000 K and cooler regions, but the problem states that the overall T_eff is 5500 K. So for the sake of this problem, perhaps we can model the photospheric temperature as the average of the two regions. But when looking at the line ratios, since the line is formed in the photosphere, the ratio would be a function of the local temperature.

But wait, the problem says to assume that the stellar photosphere is in LTE. So each region is in LTE, but the photosphere as a whole has a mix of temperatures.

But when considering the ratio of Ti atoms, perhaps we have to find an average ratio based on each region's contribution. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem simplifies the situation by considering that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. But that would be an approximation, as the real photosphere isn't uniform.

So let's consider both possibilities.

First possibility: When spots are present, the entire photosphere is at T_avg =5500 K.

Second possibility: The photosphere has regions at 6000 K (60%) and 4317 K (40%). So the observed ratio would be a weighted average based on the emission from each region.

But which approach is correct? Hmm.

The problem says that the star's surface is covered by spots 40% of the time, and the photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So the star as a whole emits as if it were a blackbody at 5500 K. But the line ratio would be a combination of the line from the hotter and cooler regions.

But for a line transition, the equivalent width or the line strength depends on the number of absorbers in each region. Each region (hot and cold) contributes to the line based on their own n1/n2 ratio.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe the problem is expecting us to model the average ratio based on the average Teff.

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we can take T_avg =5500 K and T_no_spots =6000 K.

So the ratio R is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( - h c / lambda k T ), because the energy difference ΔE is hc/lambda. Oh wait, the Boltzmann factor is exp(−(E2−E1)/(k T)).

But E can be expressed as hc/lambda. Wait, the transition corresponds to wavelength λ=1448 Å. So the energy difference E2-E1 = h c / λ.

So ΔE = h c / λ.

So the ratio R is (g1/g2) exp( - ΔE/(k T) )

But since g1 and g2 are statistical weights, they are constants for each level. So when taking the ratio R1/R2 (without spots and with spots), the g's would cancel.

Wait, but in the problem, the ratio is observed to decrease when spots are present. So R_no_spots / R_with_spots = ?

Wait, but R is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So for no spots, T1=6000 K. With spots, T2=5500 K.

So the ratio without spots is R1 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

The ratio with spots is R2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So the factor is R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/(k T2)) - (ΔE/(k T1)) )

Wait, because R1/R2 = [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] 
= exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )
= exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Wait, no. Let me recheck:

R1/R2 = [exp(-a/T1)] / [exp(-a/T2)] where a=ΔE/k.

= exp( a (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, because:

= exp( ( -a/T1 + a/T2 ) ) = exp( a (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Hmm, that's correct.

So compute a (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

But a = ΔE/(k) = (h c) / (lambda k )

So let's plug in the values.

h = Planck's constant = 6.626e-34 J s
c = speed of light = 3e8 m/s
lambda = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m
k = Boltzmann constant = 1.38e-23 J/K

So,

a = (h c) / (lambda k ) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Denominator: 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = (1.448 *1.38 )e-30 = approx 1.996e-30 J m/K.

So a = (1.9878e-25 ) / (1.996e-30 ) ≈ 1e5 (approx 100,000).

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m
Denominator: 1.448e-7 m *1.38e-23 J/K = (1.448 *1.38) = approx 1.996, so 1.996e-30 J m/K

So a = 1.9878e-25 / 1.996e-30 = (1.9878 / 1.996) * 1e5 ≈ approx 0.996 * 1e5 = 99,600 K.

Wait, because the units: J m / (J m/K ) ) = K.

So a ≈ approximately 1e5 K.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the calculation.

h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

lambda k = 1.448e-7 m *1.38e-23 J/K = (1.448 *1.38) *1e-30 J m/K.

1.448 *1.38 ≈ 1.448 *1.38 = Let's compute:

1.4 *1.38 = 1.932, 0.048 *1.38=0.06624 → total approx 2. So 2e-30.

So a = (1.9878e-25) / (2e-30) )= 1.9878e5 / 2 → 9.939e4 → about 99,390 K.

So a ≈ 9.939e4 K = 99,390 K.

Wait, but 99,390 K is a very high temperature. How does that compare to the temperatures we have, 6000 K and 5500 K.

So now, a (1/T2 - 1/T1) = 99390 K [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ] K^-1.

Compute the term inside the brackets.

1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4 K^-1.

1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4 K^-1.

Difference: 1.818e-4 - 1.6667e-4 = 0.1513e-4 = 1.513e-5 K^-1.

Multiply by a: 99390 * 1.513e-5 = approx.

99390 * 1.513e-5 = (approx 1e5 ) * 1.513e-5 → 15.13.

But more accurately:

99390 * 1.513e-5 = 99390 * (1.513 / 1e5 ) = (99390 / 1e5 ) * 1.513.

99390 /1e5 = 0.9939.

0.9939 * 1.513 ≈ 1.504.

So the exponent is about 1.504.

So R1/R2 = exp(1.504) ≈ e^1.504.

We know that e^1 = 2.718, e^1.6 ≈4.953, e^1.5 is about 4.4817.

Wait, let me compute e^1.504 more accurately.

We can approximate it as:

e^1.5 = about 4.4817.

e^0.004 = approx 1 + 0.004 + (0.004)^2/2 = 1.004008.

So e^1.504 ≈ e^1.5 * e^0.004 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.004008 ≈ 4.4817 + 0.0179 ≈ 4.4996.

So approximately 4.5.

So the ratio R1/R2 is about 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the factor is approximately 4.5.

But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, the calculation assumed that the entire photosphere's temperature is 5500 K when the spots are present. But earlier, when I computed considering the spots, the spot temperature was about 4317 K. So if the actual situation is that the photosphere is a mix, does that affect the ratio?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to model the average temperature correctly.

Wait, but the problem says that the effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% is covered by spots. So perhaps the correct approach is to model the temperature as 5500 K for the entire photosphere, even though that's not physically accurate, but for the sake of the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the impact of the lower temperature on the ionization balance, which affects the ratio of neutral Ti.

Wait, but the question says the ratio of neutral Ti atoms. Hmm, but wait, when temperature decreases, the ionization decreases. So more neutral atoms would be present. But the ratio n1/n2 is about the population between two energy levels, not ionization. So it's about the same species but different energy levels.

In this case, the ratio is governed by the Boltzmann equation. So a lower temperature would reduce the ratio n1/n2, since the denominator (n2) would have more population at lower T.

Wait, if the energy difference is positive (E2 > E1), then at lower T, the exp(-ΔE/(kT)) becomes smaller. Because T is lower, denominator kT is smaller, so the exponent is more negative. So the ratio (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)) would be smaller at lower T. So when the star has spots, T is lower, so ratio (n1/n2) decreases. Which matches the observation in the problem.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is R_no_spots / R_with_spots = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Which we computed as approximately 4.5.

So the correct answer is option C, ~4.5.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
R = \frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights of the levels, \(\Delta E = h c / \lambda\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Parameters:
- Without spots: \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\),
- With spots: \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\),
- Wavelength of the transition: \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\),
- Planck constant: \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J s}\),
- Speed of light: \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\),
- Boltzmann constant: \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\).

### Step 1: Compute the energy difference \(\Delta E\)
The energy difference is given by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{h c}{\lambda}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Convert to units of energy per particle:

\[
\Delta E \approx 99,390 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the ratio \(R_1 / R_2\)
The ratio of the populations without and with spots is:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substitute \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\), \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\), and \(\Delta E / k = 99,390 \, \text{K}\):

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(99,390 \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right)\right).
\]

Compute the term inside the exponent:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} \approx 1.818 \times 10^{-4}, \quad \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.667 \times 10^{-4},
\]
\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.513 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(99,390 \times 1.513 \times 10^{-5}\right).
\]

Simplify:

\[
99,390 \times 1.513 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.504.
\]

Finally:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp(1.504) \approx 4.5.
\]

### Conclusion:
The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately **4.5**.
