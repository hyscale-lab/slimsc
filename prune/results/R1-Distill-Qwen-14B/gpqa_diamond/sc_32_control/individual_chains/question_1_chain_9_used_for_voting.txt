Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. And the task is to find out which energy difference allows us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A to D.

Wait, so I remember that the uncertainty principle is relevant here. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, right? It states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, like energy and time, can be known simultaneously. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

So, the lifetime of a state is related to the uncertainty in energy. The longer the lifetime (Δt), the smaller the uncertainty in energy (ΔE), because ΔE and Δt are inversely related. Conversely, a shorter lifetime would mean a larger uncertainty in energy.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between the two states. We need to make sure that the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, we can't really tell them apart clearly.

Hmm, so each state has its own lifetime and thus its own energy uncertainty. Let me think. For each state, the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be approximately ħ divided by the lifetime Δt. 

So for the first state, E1, its lifetime is τ1 = 1e-9 sec. So ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1. Similarly, for E2, τ2 = 1e-8 sec, so ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2.

But wait, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Let me convert that into eV·s because the options are in eV. I remember that 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 joules. So, ħ in eV·s is (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, for ΔE1: ħ / τ1 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.582e-7 eV. Similarly, ΔE2 = (6.582e-16) / (1e-8) = 6.582e-8 eV.

Wait, so the energy uncertainties are about 6.58e-7 eV for the first state and 6.58e-8 eV for the second. But wait, the second state has a longer lifetime, so smaller ΔE.

But the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. To clearly distinguish the two, the energy difference ΔE (E2 - E1) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties? Or perhaps each's uncertainty. Wait, maybe it's the sum of the uncertainties because if the difference is smaller than either, you can't tell them apart.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in the energy measurements of each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, then you can't observe it distinctly. So to resolve them, ΔE must be greater than both ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Wait, but ΔE1 is larger than ΔE2 because τ1 is smaller. So the more critical condition is that the energy difference must be greater than ΔE1, because ΔE1 is the larger uncertainty. Because if the difference is bigger than the bigger uncertainty, it's definitely bigger than the smaller one.

So, let's compute the ΔE1: 6.58e-7 eV. So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be more than this value for them to be distinguishable.

Now, looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 eV is way smaller than 6.58e-7 eV. So no, can't distinguish.

B) 1e-11 eV → Even smaller, not good.

C) 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is way larger than 6.58e-7 (which is 0.000000658). So this would be sufficient.

D) 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is 0.00000001, still smaller than 6.58e-7. So no.

So the only option that's larger than 6.58e-7 eV is option C. So the correct answer is C.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) to the lifetime (\( \Delta t \)) of the state:  

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

Here, \( \hbar \) (reduced Planck's constant) is approximately \( 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). For each state, the uncertainty in energy is given by:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties
- For the first state (\( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \)):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
  \]

- For the second state (\( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \)):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the energy difference requirement
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference (\( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \)) must be greater than the larger uncertainty, which is \( \Delta E_1 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This ensures that the difference is resolved above the uncertainty.

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is smaller than \( \Delta E_1 \), so it cannot distinguish the states.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is even smaller than Option A and also cannot distinguish the states.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is much larger than \( \Delta E_1 \), so it can distinguish the states.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is smaller than \( \Delta E_1 \), so it cannot distinguish the states.

### Conclusion
The only energy difference that satisfies the condition is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
