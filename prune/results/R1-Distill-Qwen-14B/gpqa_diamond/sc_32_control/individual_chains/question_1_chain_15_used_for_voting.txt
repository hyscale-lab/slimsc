Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each with different energy values.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the lifetime of a state is related to its uncertainty in energy. Oh right! The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle comes into play here. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is greater than or equal to ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Wait, wait. So the uncertainty principle equation is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. Or sometimes it's written as ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt), depending on the exact formulation. Since the lifetimes given are the times for which the states exist, I think Δt here would be the lifetime of the state. Because the longer the lifetime (Δt), the smaller the uncertainty in energy, right?

So each state has its own Δt. But wait, how does this relate to the energy difference between the two states? Oh, right. To clearly distinguish two energy levels, the energy difference between them (ΔE) must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart; they'd be indistinguishable.

Wait, let me think again. The uncertainty in energy for each state is given by the Heisenberg principle. For state 1, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2Δt1), and similarly for state 2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2Δt2). But since the states are being observed, the energy difference between them has to be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, maybe? Or perhaps just larger than the individual uncertainty? Hmm, not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: when you have two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1. To resolve them, the energy difference must be such that the uncertainty in energy from each state doesn't make them overlap. So the minimum ΔE needed is such that it's greater than both individual uncertainties, or perhaps the sum?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is bigger than the uncertainty, then you can distinguish them. So for each state, the energy uncertainty is ΔE_i = ħ / (2Δt_i). So for the two states, we have ΔE1 = ħ/(2*1e-9) and ΔE2 = ħ/(2*1e-8). Since Δt2 is larger, ΔE2 will be smaller than ΔE1.

Wait, but how does this relate to the energy difference between the two states? Well, if the energy difference is larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties, then we can resolve them. Because if ΔE (E2-E1) is larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2, then you can tell them apart. Alternatively, maybe it's just larger than the maximum of the two.

Wait, no. Let's think in terms of precision. If the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state, then you can resolve the two levels. So the minimum required ΔE is such that ΔE > max(ΔE1, ΔE2). Because the larger uncertainty would be the limiting factor.

So let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

But since the options are given in eV, maybe I should convert the energy into eV.

Wait, 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 joules. So to get the energy in eV, I can compute ħ/(2Δt) in eV.

Let's compute ΔE1 for state 1: Δt1 = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 * Δt1) = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9) = approx 5.272859e-26 J.

Now converting to eV: since 1 J = 1/(1.60218e-19) eV, so 5.272859e-26 J is 5.272859e-26 / 1.60218e-19 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Wait, wait: 5.272859e-26 / 1.60218e-19 = (5.272859 / 1.60218) ) * 1e-7 ≈ 3.29 * 1e-7 = 3.29e-7 eV. So about 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, for state 2, Δt2 = 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * 1e-8) = 1.0545718e-34 / (2e-8) = 5.272859e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.272859e-27 / 1.60218e-19 = (5.272859 / 1.60218) ) * 1e-8 ≈3.29 * 1e-8 ≈3.29e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV.

Now, the energy difference ΔE must be bigger than the maximum of these two uncertainties. Because if ΔE is bigger than the uncertainty, then the two levels can be resolved.

So the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2 is 3.29e-7 eV.

So the energy difference needs to be larger than 3.29e-7 eV. Let's look at the options.

Options are:
A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-7 eV
B) 1e-11 eV → negligible, much smaller than 3e-7
C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → which is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 3.29e-7.
Wait wait, 1e-4 is 1e-4, which is 0.0001. 3.29e-7 is 0.000000329. So 1e-4 is bigger than that.

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 3.29e-7 eV. So this would allow clear distinction.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV. That's larger than ΔE2 (3.29e-8), but smaller than ΔE1 (3.29e-7). So 1e-8 eV is smaller than 3.29e-7, which is the maximum of the two. So ΔE would be 1e-8, which is less than ΔE1 (3.29e-7), so the energy difference would be smaller than the uncertainty of the first state. Thus, you can't resolve them.

So looking at the options, the only one that's larger than the maximum uncertainty (3.29e-7) is option C, 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is bigger than 3.29e-7. So yes, it's much bigger. So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question says "their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved." So the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty. So the minimal required ΔE is larger than the maximum of the individual uncertainties.

In this case, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way above 3.29e-7 eV.

What about option D? 1e-8 eV: that's 0.00000001 eV. But the maximum uncertainty is 3.29e-7 eV, which is 0.000000329 eV. So 1e-8 is smaller than 3.29e-7. So the energy difference would be too small, and you can't resolve them.

So the options are A: 1e-9 eV, which is 0.000000001 eV. That's way too small. So it's not an option.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the exponents. Let me recheck the calculations.

ΔE1: ħ/(2Δt1) where Δt1 is 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = (1.05457e-34) / (2e-9) ) = 1.05457e-34 / 2e-9 = 5.27285e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 5.27285e-26 J / (1.60218e-19 J/eV) ) = approx 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, for Δt2 = 1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = (1.05457e-34) / (2e-8) = 5.27285e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.27285e-27 / 1.60218e-19 = 3.29e-8 eV.

So yes, that's correct.

So for the energy difference ΔE to be clearly distinguishable, it must be larger than the maximum uncertainty, which is 3.29e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. 1e-4 is 100 times larger than 1e-6, which is way above 3.29e-7.

So option C is the correct answer.

To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) such that they can be clearly distinguished, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) and the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) is approximately \( \hbar / 2 \), where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant. For a state with lifetime \( \Delta t \), the energy uncertainty is given by:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t}.
\]

The lifetimes of the two states are \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). The energy uncertainties for the two states are:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_2}.
\]

Substituting \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and converting the uncertainties to electron volts (1 eV = \( 1.60218 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

1. For \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 5.272859 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to eV:
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{5.272859 \times 10^{-26}}{1.60218 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 5.272859 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to eV:
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{5.272859 \times 10^{-27}}{1.60218 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties, \( \max(\Delta E_1, \Delta E_2) \). Here, \( \Delta E_1 = 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) is the larger uncertainty. Therefore, \( \Delta E \) must be greater than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.001 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This is insufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is negligible and much smaller than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This is insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This is sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This is insufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **Option C**.
