Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star relative to each other, as well as the orientation of the orbit. 

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, which I think isn't directly relevant for the transit probability. The key factors are their orbital periods and the properties of their host stars.

Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star since a shorter period means a smaller orbit. But wait, the star's mass matters too for the orbit. Planet_1's host has twice the mass of Planet_2's. I'm trying to remember Kepler's third law here, which relates the orbital period to the mass of the star and the semi-major axis. Oh right, Kepler's law: (P^2) = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. Since the planets have the same mass compared to their stars (probably negligible), so P² is proportional to a³/(M_star). 

So for Planet_1: P₁ = P₂ /3. So P₁² = (P₂²)/9. So (a₁³)/(M₁) = (a₂³)/(M₂) * (P₁²)/(P₂²). Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me write the formula properly. 

Using P² ∝ a³/(M_star), so a³ = P² * M_star * (some constant). 

So for each planet, a₁³ = (P₁²) * M₁. Similarly, a₂³ = (P₂²) * M₂. Since M₁ is twice M₂, and P₁ is P₂/3. Let's plug in numbers. Let me denote P2 as P, so P1 is P/3. 

a₁³ = ( (P/3)^2 ) * 2M₂. 
a₂³ = (P^2) * M₂.

So a₁³ = (P²/9) * 2M₂ = (2/9) P² M₂. 
a₂³ = P² M₂.

So a₁³ / a₂³ = (2/9) P² M₂ / (P² M₂) ) = 2/9. So a₁ = a₂ * (2/9)^(1/3). Let's calculate that exponent: 2/9 is approximately 0.222. Cube root of 0.222 is around 0.6. Wait, 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close. So a₁ is about 0.6 times a₂.

Wait, but a is the semi-major axis. So a₁ is smaller than a₂, which makes sense because Planet_1 has a shorter period and is orbiting a more massive star, so it's closer in.

But how does that affect the transit probability? The transit probability depends on the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. The probability is roughly (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a. So the probability is higher when the star is larger or the planet is closer (smaller a). Wait no, actually, the probability is inversely proportional to the orbital distance a, because the area where the planet can transit is a function of a.

Wait, let me think. The probability of transit is proportional to (R_star + R_planet) / a, which is approximately R_star / a, because R_planet is negligible. So the probability is (R_star / a) * some other factors. 

But in this case, the host stars have the same radius. So R_star is same for both. So the transit probability is inversely proportional to a. So the planet with smaller a has a higher probability of transiting. 

Wait, that would mean Planet_1 has a smaller a, so higher probability. But wait, wait, what else affects the probability? The size of the planet and star, but the planets have the same mass. Wait, but mass doesn't directly translate to radius. Oh, wait, but the question says both have the same mass, but we don't know their radii. Oh, but for the transit probability, the planet's radius matters. Hmm, but the question doesn't give us information about the planet radii. Both have same minimum mass, but maybe same size? The question says both have the same masses, so perhaps same radius as well, assuming similar densities. So if their radii are same, then the (R_star + R_planet) would be same, as R_star is same.

So the transit probability is inversely proportional to a. So Planet_1 has a smaller a, so higher transit probability. 

Wait, but what are the a values? Let me compute the ratio of a₁/a₂. Earlier, a₁³ is (2/9) a₂³. So a₁ = a₂ * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ a₂ * 0.6. So a is smaller for Planet_1, so transit probability is higher. 

So transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a), which is the same as 1/a since R is same. So Planet_1's transit probability is (1/a₁) and Planet_2 is (1/a₂). So since a₁ is 0.6 a₂, 1/a₁ is about 1.666 times 1/a₂. So P1 transit probability is about 1.666 times that of P2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

Wait, but wait, the way I thought earlier, transit probability is R/(a) multiplied by the probability term from the inclination, which is (R_star / a) multiplied by another factor based on the orbital inclination.

Wait, actually, the transit probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a * (something else). Wait, no, the geometric probability is given by (R_star / a)^2 * (something else). Or maybe it's (R_star / a) multiplied by the solid angle. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Let me recall. The probability that a planet transits is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance, multiplied by the planet's orbital inclination. Wait, no, the transit happens when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability that the inclination is correct is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / a, but if R_planet is much smaller, it's R_star / a. 

But wait, actually, the exact formula for the transit probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a. But this is the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned within the cone that allows a transit, given uniform distribution of inclinations. So the probability is (2 (R_star + R_planet) )/(a (1 + (a/(R_star + R_planet)) )) ), but maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, the transit probability is roughly the ratio of the star's size to the distance, which is R/a. 

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to remember that the probability is proportional to (R_star / a), because the area of the star is π R_star². The planet must cross this disk as seen from Earth. The area in which the planet can be positioned to cause a transit is a function of a. 

Alternatively, the transit probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a. But if the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, it's approximately R_star / a. Since R_star is same for both planets, the transit probability is inversely proportional to a. So the planet with the smaller a has a higher probability.

So, as calculated earlier, a₁ is about 0.6 a₂. So P1 transit probability is (1/a₁) ≈ 1/(0.6 a₂) ) = (1.666)/a₂. So if P2's probability is (1/a₂), then P1's is 1.666 times higher.

Wait, but the question says the researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability. So Planet_1 has a higher probability. So the answer would be option C or D. Let me check the options:

Options:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.

Wait, I calculated about 1.666, which is approximately 1.67 times. Looking at the options, option C says ~1.65 times, which is very close. So option C is correct.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let's redo the a₁ and a₂. 

We have:

P₁ = P₂ /3.

M₁ = 2 M₂.

Using Kepler's third law: (P²) = (4π² G)⁻¹ (a³ (M₁ + m))⁻¹. Since m << M, P² ∝ a³ / M.

So, for Planet_1:

(P₁²) / (P₂²) = (a₁³ / M₁) / (a₂³ / M₂).

So, ( (P₂/3)^2 ) / P₂² = (a₁^3 / (2 M₂)) / (a₂^3 / M₂).

Left side: (P₂² /9) / P₂² = 1/9.

Right side: (a₁^3) / (2 M₂) * M₂ / a₂^3 = (a₁^3) / (2 a₂^3).

So 1/9 = (a₁^3) / (2 a₂^3)

Which gives a₁^3 = (2/9) a₂^3.

So a₁ = a₂ * (2/9)^(1/3).

Calculating (2/9)^(1/3):

2/9 ≈ 0.2222.

Cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606, because 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222.

So a₁ ≈ 0.606 a₂.

Thus, a₁ is about 0.606 times a₂.

So transit probability is proportional to R_star / a. Since R is same, the ratio is 1/a.

So P1's probability is (1 / a₁) = 1/(0.606 a₂) ≈ 1.65 times (1/a₂), which is P2's probability. So yes, about 1.65 times higher. So option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the orbital distance of the planet. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_{\text{star}} \)), the transit probability depends inversely on the orbital distance \( a \). Therefore, the planet with the smaller orbital distance has a higher transit probability.

Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_{\text{star}}} \), we calculate the orbital distances \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \) for Planet_1 and Planet_2, respectively. Given:
- \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter),
- \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) (mass of Planet_1's host star is twice that of Planet_2's host star),

we substitute into the proportionality:

\[
\frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / M_1}{a_2^3 / M_2}.
\]

Substituting \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) and \( M_1 = 2M_2 \), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{2a_2^3}.
\]

Solving for \( a_1 \), we find:

\[
a_1^3 = \frac{2}{9} a_2^3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a_1 = a_2 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

The cube root of \( \frac{2}{9} \) is approximately \( 0.606 \), so:

\[
a_1 \approx 0.606 a_2.
\]

Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), the transit probability of Planet_1 is:

\[
\text{Probability}_1 \propto \frac{1}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.606 a_2} \approx 1.65 \cdot \frac{1}{a_2}.
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prefer observing Planet_1.
