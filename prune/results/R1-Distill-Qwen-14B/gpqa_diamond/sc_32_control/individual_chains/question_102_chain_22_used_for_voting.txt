Okay, so I need to figure out why there's no green signal in the mice when they're visualized under the confocal microscope. Let's try to go through the question step by step.

First, the setup: They've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs, right? So, the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor's ORF is at the 3', and it's fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. IRES is a type of internal ribosome entry site, which allows for translation of a second ORF without a full termination codon, I think. So the ligand and receptor are probably expressed together.

Now, the stop cassettes: between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Oh wait, I've heard about this before. LoxP and lox2272 are loxP variants used in Cre/Lox systems. They're used for recombination. So when Cre is expressed, it will recognize these sites and cause the stop cassette to be excised, allowing the downstream gene to be expressed.

So in the vector, the ligand is followed by a stop cassette. The mCherry is probably after that, but it's only expressed if the stop is removed. Similarly for the receptor and eGFP. So for mCherry and eGFP to be expressed, the Cre must have acted to remove the stop cassettes.

Wait, but in the case of the vector, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is probably a strong promoter. The receptor is under the control of the IRES, which is after the ligand's coding region, I think. Or maybe the IRES is part of the vector's structure.

Wait, no. The vector is bicistronic. So the first gene (ligand) is under CBA, and the second (receptor) is under the control of an IRES, which would allow it to be translated from the same mRNA as the ligand. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the receptor is not because the stop cassette is in place. When Cre is introduced, the stop cassettes are removed, so both the mCherry and eGFP are expressed.

But wait, the vector is a lox-Cre vector. So when Cre is expressed, in the presence of LoxP and lox2272 sites, the stop cassettes are removed. So, in the ligand's case, the stop is between ligand and mCherry. So when Cre is present, that stop is removed, so the ligand and mCherry are co-expressed. Similarly, for the receptor, the stop between receptor and eGFP is lox2272-based. So Cre would remove that stop as well, expressing receptor and eGFP.

But then they used this vector in primary astrocyte culture, and tested expression via Western blot. They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. The blot shows signals proportional to actin, which is a loading control. So the question is, after transfection, are the ligand and receptor (and their respective tags) being expressed?

Wait, but in the mice, they have a homozygous construct. They crossed the mice to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. Cre is under the control of SOX10, perhaps? So the Cre would be expressed in neural crest cells, leading to recombination in those cells.

But why no green signal? Green is eGFP, which is fused to the receptor. So either the receptor-eGFP isn't being expressed or not being detected.

Looking at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But that might affect function, not expression. The question is about expression, so maybe not relevant here.

Option B: receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. If that's the case, maybe it's not expressed on the cell surface, but why no eGFP detected? The Western blot would show if it's expressed. If the blot showed the receptor, then this might not be the issue. But the question says they tested the construct's expression on Western. Wait, the question says they used the antibodies against the overexpressed proteins on the blot. So if the Western blot shows the proteins, then the problem is not in expression but in detection during the mouse experiment.

Option C: enhancer for expression is missing. The promoter is CBA for the ligand. If the promoter isn't working, the ligand wouldn't be expressed, but that's under the CBA promoter, which should be strong. Plus, the vector uses IRES for the receptor. So maybe C isn't correct.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP might not be expressed properly, leading to a truncated or nonfunctional protein. So the eGFP might not be fluorescent, but the receptor itself would still be expressed. But in the Western blot, they're using antibodies against the overexpressed proteins (receptor and ligand), so if the receptor is expressed, they should see a band. If the Western shows the receptor, then D is not the issue. But if the Western doesn't show anything, maybe something else is wrong.

Wait, the question says they used the antibodies to test construct expression after transfection in astrocytes. So the Western blot would have shown whether the ligand and receptor were expressed. But the question doesn't mention the blot results other than "proportional to actin loading," which suggests that the blot worked, but not necessarily if the proteins were present.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector isn't being properly expressed in the mice. But why?

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic vector with loxP sites. When Cre is expressed, it removes the stop cassettes, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed. But in the mouse model, the construct is homozygous, and they crossed to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. So SOX10-Cre would express Cre in the neural crest cells. Thus, in those cells, the stop cassettes should be removed, allowing both the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP to be expressed.

But the question states that the mouse offspring are visualized, and no green signal is observed. So the eGFP is not being expressed or detected.

Hmm, possible issues: 

1. The Cre isn't active in the right cells or at the right time. But the question says they used SOX10-Cre, which should target neural crest cells. So maybe the Cre isn't working, but that's not one of the options.

2. The stop cassette wasn't properly excised. The loxP and lox2272 sites are different. In the vector, the ligand has a loxP stop cassette, and the receptor has a lox2272 stop. So Cre recombinase can only excise the loxP sites if they are in the correct orientation. Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 sites aren't recognized by the Cre used. Wait, the standard Cre doesn't cut lox2272. Oh wait, lox2272 is a variant that is recognized by Cre but requires a longer recognition sequence. Or vice versa, some Cre variants can't recognize it unless it's a certain type. Wait, actually, lox2272 is a loxP variant which requires Cre to have the wild-type sequence. Wait, I think that lox2272 is compatible with regular Cre. Or am I getting this wrong?

Wait, the loxP and lox2272 sites are both recognized by Cre, but lox2272 is a mutant that allows for directional recombination. So when Cre is present, it can recognize lox2272 sites, but the way they're arranged can affect whether the site is excised. So perhaps the problem is that the lox2272 sites aren't being cut by Cre, so the stop isn't removed, and thus the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed.

So the vector has the ligand with loxP stop, and the receptor with lox2272 stop. If the Cre can't recognize the lox2272 site, then the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

Wait, but standard Cre should recognize lox2272 sites. Lox2272 is a type of loxP that has a higher efficiency with Cre. So perhaps the issue is that the lox sites are in the wrong orientation. For example, in a loxP site, the two sites are in opposite directions. So if the vector has loxP in one direction for the ligand and lox2272 in the other for the receptor, maybe the Cre can't recombine both.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has loxP sites in a way that when Cre is added, it doesn't excise both stops. For example, if the ligand's loxP is in a way that excising it would cause the mCherry to be expressed, but the receptor's lox2272 isn't being cut.

Wait, but the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. So each allele has the same vector. When they cross to SOX10-Cre, the Cre would only act on the lox sites in the construct. So if the lox sites are correctly placed, the stops should be excised.

But wait, the vector is a bicistronic loxP vector. Let me picture the construct:

The vector has the ligand under CBA promoter, followed by a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP). Then, the IRES element, followed by the receptor ORF, followed by a stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272), then eGFP.

Wait, no. The vector is for bicistronic expression, so both ORFs are on the same mRNA. So, the first ORF (ligand) is under a promoter, and the second (receptor) is under an IRES. The stop cassettes are after each ORF, which are flanked by lox sites.

So, the structure is:

CBA promoter -> Ligand ORF -> loxP-stop-loxP -> IRES -> Receptor ORF -> lox2272-stop-lox2272 -> eGFP.

So, without Cre, the ligand is expressed (under CBA), but the stop cassette after it prevents the mCherry from being expressed. The receptor is under the IRES, so it's expressed as a second ORF. But the stop cassette after the receptor (lox2272) prevents eGFP from being expressed.

When Cre is introduced, it recognizes the lox sites. For the ligand's stop, the loxP sites would be recognized, and the stop cassette is excised, allowing mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, for the receptor, the lox2272 sites are recognized, and the stop is excised, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

But perhaps the issue is that Cre isn't able to excise both cassettes. Or maybe the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop isn't removed.

Wait, but the mouse doesn't show any green signal. So, perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed. Why?

Looking at the options, D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that the stop was removed, but the reading frame shifts, leading to a nonfunctional eGFP. But the Western blot would still show the receptor being expressed, unless it's truncated. Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop wasn't removed, but the receptor is expressed without eGFP.

Wait, but the Western blot was used to test the construct's expression. They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins (presumably the ligand and receptor). So if the ligand and receptor are expressed, but eGFP isn't, the Western would show the presence of the proteins.

But in the mouse experiment, the eGFP isn't being detected. So the question is why eGFP isn't expressed, leading to no green signal.

Wait, another possibility: The vector's bicistronic setup may not have allowed the receptor to be expressed correctly. For example, the IRES may not be working, but that's probably taken care of by the vector design.

Another thought: the lox sites might be in the wrong orientation. For example, if both stops are loxP, then Cre would excise both. But if one is loxP and the other is lox2272, maybe the Cre can't recognize both. Or perhaps the lox2272 site isn't properly recognized by the Cre used.

Wait, no, the lox2272 is compatible with standard Cre. So that shouldn't be the issue.

Wait, perhaps the positioning of the lox sites is such that the Cre can't cut both. For example, the ligand's loxP is in a forward direction, and the receptor's lox2272 is in a reverse direction, making it difficult for Cre to act on both.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector wasn't properly recombined. If the vector is a bicistronic vector, but the lox sites are not in the right orientation or number, then the Cre won't excise the stops.

Wait, the ligand has a loxP stop, and the receptor has a lox2272 stop. Cre can recognize both, but perhaps the lox2272 stop isn't being cut because of the way the vector is constructed. For example, the lox2272 sites may not be in the right orientation relative to each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox sites are not correctly placed. For example, the loxP sites for the ligand may not flank the stop cassette correctly. If the lox sites are in the wrong orientation, the Cre won't cut, and the stop remains.

Wait, in the vector description, the ligand ORF is at 5' with a stop in a loxP cassette, and the receptor has a stop in a lox2272 cassette. So, the vector should have the ligand followed by loxP stop, then IRES, then receptor, then lox2272 stop, then eGFP.

When Cre is expressed, it should excise both stops, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed. But in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed. So another possibility is that the Cre isn't active in the cells where the construct is present. But the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should drive Cre expression in neural crest cells.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassettes were not properly removed because the vector has a single lox site and not a pair. No, because the stops are in loxP and lox2272 cassettes, which are each a pair.

Another angle: The antibodies used for Western blotting might not detect the eGFP, but that's not the case because the problem is with the confocal not showing green.

Wait, the question says the mouse model was homozygous for the construct. So both alleles have the same vector. When they cross to SOX10-Cre mice, which are hemizygous, the Cre is provided. So the Cre should cause the stops to be excised in neural crest cells.

But if, for some reason, the Cre can't excise the lox2272 site, then the receptor-eGFP would not be expressed. So why would Cre not excise the lox2272 stop?

Wait, maybe the lox2272 sites are in a configuration that requires a different type of Cre, like a mutant Cre that can recognize both lox2272 and loxP. Or perhaps the vector is designed such that the lox sites are not correctly arranged for Cre to cut.

Alternatively, perhaps the loxP and lox2272 sites in the vector are in a way that when Cre is introduced, only one of the stops is excised. For example, the loxP is excised, allowing mCherry to be expressed, but the lox2272 isn't, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the vector uses different lox sites for each stop: the ligand's stop is loxP, and the receptor's is lox2272. So Cre would need to recognize both. But lox2272 is a variant, so perhaps the Cre can't recognize it, leaving the receptor's stop in place.

But wait, standard Cre can recognize lox2272. Or can it?

I think that Cre can recognize lox2272. The lox2272 site is a variant that requires Cre with a certain sequence, but I think standard Cre can still recognize it, just maybe not as efficiently. So perhaps the problem is that the lox2272 site isn't being properly recognized, so the stop isn't excised.

But another possibility is that the vector is designed in a way that the loxP and lox2272 sites are in the same orientation, making their recombination impossible. Wait, no, because the sites should be in opposite orientations for recombination to occur.

Wait, wait. Normally, loxP sites are in opposite orientations (one forwards, one backwards) so that Cre can recognize them and cut. If both sites are in the same direction, Cre can't recombine. So, perhaps in the vector, the ligand's loxP is in one direction, and the receptor's lox2272 is also in the same direction. That would prevent the stops from being excised, so mCherry and eGFP aren't expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps only the loxP sites are in the correct orientation, and the lox2272 sites are not. So the ligand's stop is excised, but the receptor's isn't.

In that case, the mCherry would be expressed (from the ligand's expression), but the eGFP wouldn't be, because the stop remains. So the mouse would show red (mCherry) but not green (eGFP).

But in the question, the problem is that there's no green signal. So perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop isn't excised.

But why would the stop not be excised? Because the lox2272 sites are in the same orientation as the loxP sites, so they can't be cut by Cre.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector's lox sites are in a configuration that prevents recombination. For example, if the lox sites are in the same direction, Cre can't cut.

Wait, the loxP and lox2272 sites are in the same orientation. So the ligand's loxP is in a forward direction, and the receptor's lox2272 is in the same forward direction. That would mean that when Cre is introduced, it can't cut either, because it requires two sites in opposite orientation.

Wait, but the loxP and lox2272 are separate, so each has its own pair. So for the ligand's stop, the two loxP sites are in opposite directions, allowing Cre to cut. Similarly for the receptor's lox2272 sites.

Wait, no. Each stop cassette has a pair of lox sites. So the ligand's stop has a forward loxP and a reverse loxP, making a pair. The same for the receptor's lox2272.

In that case, the Cre would act on each pair, excising each stop. So why isn't it happening?

Wait, perhaps the vector isn't designed correctly. Let's think about the structure again. The ligand is 5' end, followed by stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), then IRES, then receptor, then stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272), then eGFP.

In this case, each stop is a cassette with its own pair of lox sites. So when Cre is present, it should cut both, excising both stops. So mCherry and eGFP should both be expressed in the presence of Cre.

But the mouse experiment shows no green. So another possibility is that the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop isn't excised, but the ligand's stop was.

Wait, but if the ligand's stop was excised, the mCherry would be expressed. But the problem states that the mouse isn't showing green, but perhaps mCherry is red. Maybe the test was only for eGFP, or perhaps the experiment focused on the receptor's expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the vector wasn't correctly recombined. For example, the lox2272 sites were not recognized, so the stop remains, preventing eGFP from being expressed.

So why would Cre not cut the lox2272 sites? Because the vector has a different strain's Cre, maybe. No, the question says the mice are in the wt background, so the Cre is provided by the SOX10-Cre mice.

Wait, maybe the vector's lox2272 sites are in the wrong orientation, preventing Cre from cutting. For example, both lox2272 sites are in the same orientation, so Cre can't recognize them. So the stop isn't excised, and eGFP isn't expressed.

So, in the vector, the ligand's stop is correctly arranged with loxP sites in opposite directions, allowing Cre to cut and excise the stop. But the receptor's stop, with lox2272, has the sites in the same direction, so Cre can't cut, leaving the stop in place. Therefore, eGFP isn't expressed.

That would explain why the green signal isn't observed.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has a single lox site, but that's unlikely.

Another angle: The SOX10-Cre mice might not be providing enough Cre to excise both stops. But that seems unlikely because Cre is strong enough.

Wait, the options given: the correct answer is probably D. Let me think again.

Option D: the receptor and the eGFP are not in frame. So perhaps when the stop is excised, the frame shifts, leading to a nonfunctional eGFP. But the Western blot would show the presence of the receptor. However, the question states that the blot is used to test expression, and presumably, the ligand and receptor were expressed, but the eGFP isn't. So if the Western blot shows the receptor is expressed, then D is not the issue.

Alternatively, maybe the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop isn't removed, but that's due to the Cre not cutting. So which option aligns with that?

The options don't directly address the lox site orientation. The options given are A to D.

Looking again:

Option D: the receptor and the eGFP are not in frame. So the eGFP would not be expressed correctly. But the Western blot would detect the receptor, as it's expressed. But in the mouse, eGFP isn't expressed, so no green.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop isn't excised because the lox sites are in the same direction. So the stop remains, eGFP isn't expressed. But that's not one of the options. The options don't mention lox sites.

So looking back at the options:

A) paracrine relationship. Unlikely, since the issue is expression.

B) stuck in Golgi. Would affect localization, but Western would show expression.

C) enhancer missing. But the ligand is under CBA promoter.

D) not in frame. eGFP not expressed due to frame shift.

Wait, if the stop is excised, but the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, then the eGFP won't be expressed. So the receptor would be expressed, but eGFP would not. So in the mouse, you would see the receptor in Western, but not eGFP.

But the question is why there's no green (eGFP) signal. So if the stop is excised, but eGFP isn't in frame, then no eGFP.

But why would the eGFP not be in frame? Because the stop cassette was in the way, and upon excision, the frame shifts, leading to a frameshift mutation in the eGFP ORF.

Wait, but the stop cassette is between the receptor and eGFP. So when the stop is excised, the receptor and eGFP are in frame, because the ORF continues. So the eGFP should be in frame.

Unless the vector was constructed in a way that the eGFP is in a different reading frame.

Wait, perhaps the vector's design has the eGFP in a different frame. For example, the stop cassette is between receptor and eGFP. So, without the stop, the receptor is in frame with eGFP, and the entire ORF is receptor-eGFP. So the eGFP should be in frame.

But if the vector was designed incorrectly, perhaps the eGFP is in a different frame, leading to a frameshift.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not in frame, so when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed, or is expressed as a nonfunctional protein.

So, in that case, the Western blot would show the receptor, but not eGFP. But the mouse model is about the receptor-eGFP construct.

Wait, but the problem states that the mouse is homozygous for the construct, and when crossed with SOX10-Cre, the offspring are born. So, the construct is present, but the expression of eGFP is not happening.

So, the most likely reason is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop isn't excised. But why? Because the lox2272 sites are not being cut by Cre.

Wait, but the options don't mention anything about lox site recognition. So perhaps the issue is that the stop wasn't excised, but that's not one of the options.

Looking back at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Unrelated to expression.

B) receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. Unlikely, expression would show in Western.

C) enhancer missing. But the promoter is CBA, which is strong.

D) receptor and eGFP not in frame.

If the eGFP isn't in frame, the eGFP won't be expressed. The Western would show the receptor, but not eGFP. But the question says they use antibodies against the overexpressed proteins (presumably ligand and receptor), so the Western would show the presence of the receptor.

But the mouse experiment is about the eGFP expression, not the receptor.

So, if the eGFP isn't in frame, it's not expressed, so no green signal. But why would the eGFP not be in frame? Because the vector's construction caused a frameshift.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has the eGFP in a different frame, so when the stop is excised, the frame shifts. But this seems unlikely if the vector is correctly designed.

Wait, another possibility: the IRES element might not be working properly. The receptor is under the IRES, which is after the ligand. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the receptor is not. With Cre, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

But if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor may not be expressed. But the question says the vector has IRES upstream of the receptor. So perhaps the IRES isn't working, leading to no expression of the receptor and eGFP.

But that's not one of the options either.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, the question says "the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element." So the ligand is expressed under CBA, and the receptor is expressed under IRES.

But the IRES might not be functional. So even when the stop is excised, the receptor isn't expressed. But the IRES is supposed to drive expression.

Wait, but in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed and the receptor is not. With Cre, the stop is excised, and the IRES would drive the receptor's expression.

So, the issue is that the receptor isn't being expressed. But why?

Looking at the options again, the only option that relates to expression is C: the enhancer is missing. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. So perhaps the enhancer for the receptor is missing, but that's part of the IRES, which should be sufficient.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't strong enough for the receptor's expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector isn't being expressed correctly in the mice.

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't. In the presence of Cre, the stops are excised, and both mCherry and eGFP are expressed.

But in the mouse, the vector is homozygous, so each allele has the same construct. When crossed to SOX10-Cre, the Cre should act on the construct, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

But perhaps the Cre isn't active in the cells where the construct is present. But the SOX10-Cre should drive Cre expression in neural crest cells.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has a mutation that makes the IRES non-functional. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, the question states that the vector is "bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus."

So, the ligand is first, followed by a stop, then IRES, then receptor, then stop, then eGFP.

When Cre is present, the stops are excised, so mCherry and eGFP are expressed.

But maybe the issue is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop isn't excised. But why? Because the lox sites aren't compatible.

Wait, perhaps the vector uses loxP sites for both stops, and the Cre is correct. But the question says the ligand's stop is loxP, and receptor's is lox2272.

So, the ligand's stop is in loxP, and the receptor's is in lox2272. Which means that the Cre can cut both. So if the stops are excised, both mCherry and eGFP should be expressed.

But in the mouse, only mCherry is expressed (if the ligand's stop is excised), but eGFP isn't.

So, perhaps the issue is that the lox2272 sites are in the same orientation, preventing Cre from cutting them. Hence, the stop isn't excised, and eGFP isn't expressed.

But the options don't mention this.

Looking back at the options, option D says "receptor and eGFP are not in frame." That would prevent eGFP from being expressed, but the Western would show the receptor.

Another thought: perhaps the vector's design has the eGFP in the same reading frame as the receptor. So when the stop is excised, the receptor is expressed along with eGFP. If the eGFP is in a different frame, then no. But the vector's design should ensure they're in frame.

Wait, perhaps the stop cassette after the receptor is causing the eGFP to be out of frame. So when the stop is excised, the reading frame shifts, leading to a frameshift. Thus, the eGFP is not expressed.

So that would be option D.

So, the correct answer would be D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand and receptor pair in neural crest cells. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, followed by a stop cassette flanked by loxP sites, and the receptor is under an IRES element, followed by a stop cassette flanked by lox2272 sites. The vector is co-expressed with mCherry (for the ligand) and eGFP (for the receptor). After crossing mice homozygous for this construct with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option is irrelevant to the observed lack of eGFP expression. Paracrine relationships pertain to signaling between cells and do not explain why eGFP is not being expressed or detected.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, it would likely still be expressed and detected via Western blot. The absence of a green signal specifically suggests that eGFP is not being expressed, not just mislocalized.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element, which should allow its expression. There is no evidence in the question to suggest that an enhancer is missing or non-functional.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   This is the most plausible explanation. If the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, the stop cassette excision by Cre would result in a frameshift, leading to a nonfunctional or undetectable eGFP. The Western blot would still detect the receptor, but eGFP would not be expressed, consistent with the absence of a green signal in the confocal microscopy.

### Conclusion:
The absence of a green signal is best explained by the receptor and eGFP not being in frame, resulting in a frameshift that prevents eGFP expression. This aligns with the experimental setup and observations.

**Answer: D**
