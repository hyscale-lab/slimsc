Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me read it carefully again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A through D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions. So in this case, Ca-EDTA is the complex. The stoichiometric concentration is 0.02 M, which I think means that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M.

Wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Because when EDTA complexes with Ca²+, the calcium is bound up, so the free ion concentration would be low. But I need to calculate it using the K value given.

I think the formation constant K is given by the equation:

K = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

But wait, if the solution is at stoichiometric conditions, that means the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are such that they form the complex. So initially, the solution has only the complex, and it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, actually, the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial [Ca-EDTA] is 0.02 M. Let me set up the variables.

Let me denote [Ca²+] as x, and [EDTA^4-] as y. According to the dissociation:

Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

But wait, the stoichiometry is 1:1, right? So for each mole of Ca-EDTA that dissociates, you get one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

So if the complex dissociates, and let's say the change is s. Then:

[Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - s
[Ca²+] = s
[EDTA^4-] = s

Wait, but wait a minute. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration is 0.02 M. So when it dissociates, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be s each, and the complex would be 0.02 - s. But wait, if the complex is in solution, and the pH is ideal, which I think means that the EDTA is in its deprotonated form, so EDTA^4- is dominant.

So the formation constant K is given by:

K = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

We know K is 5e10, and the initial [Ca-EDTA] is 0.02 M. But wait, when the complex dissociates, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are both s. So we can write:

5e10 = (0.02 - s) / (s * s)

Wait, but if K is so large (5e10), that suggests that the complex is very stable, so s should be very small compared to 0.02. So 0.02 - s ≈ 0.02. Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

5e10 ≈ 0.02 / (s²)

So solving for s: s² = 0.02 / (5e10) → s² = 2e-12 → s ≈ sqrt(2e-12) → sqrt(2) is about 1.414, so 1.414e-6.

Wait, sqrt(2e-12) = sqrt(2) * 1e-6 ≈ 1.414e-6 M. So s ≈ 1.414e-6 M. That would be the concentration of Ca²+.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7, which is approximately (sqrt(3/10) )e-6? Wait, let me double-check the math.

Wait, wait. Let me redo the calculations more accurately.

K = 5e10 = [Complex]/([Ca²+][EDTA])

Assuming that [Ca²+] = [EDTA] = s, because 1:1 ratio.

So,

5e10 = 0.02 / (s^2)

So,

s^2 = 0.02 / (5e10)

Calculating 0.02 is 2e-2.

So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So s² =4e-13 → s = sqrt(4e-13) → 2e-6.5 → wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. The square root is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2 *3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M.

Oh, so s is about 6.3e-7 M. That matches option C, which is 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the approximation earlier. Let me check again. Because when I initially thought s was about 1.4e-6, but that was without considering that 0.02 is 2e-2, and K is 5e10.

So the correct calculation is K= [Complex]/([Ca][EDTA]) = 0.02/(s^2) =5e10.

So solving:

s^2=0.02/(5e10) = (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 =4e-13.

Wait, 0.4e-12 is same as 4e-13. So s^2=4e-13 → s=2e-6.5? Wait, 2e-6.5? No, no. Because sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) → 2 * (1e-6.5) which is 2 * (3.16e-7) = 6.32e-7 M.

Yes, that's correct. So the concentration of Ca²+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

Wait, but why did I initially think it was 1.4e-6? Because I must have messed up the exponents. Let me check again:

s² = 0.02/(5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2.

So 2e-2 /5e10 = 2/(5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Yes, so s² is 4e-13, so s is 2e-6.5, which is 6.32e-7 M. So option C is the right answer.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{Ca-EDTA} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated calcium ions be \( s \). Since the stoichiometry is 1:1, the concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ will also be \( s \), and the concentration of the complex will decrease to \( 0.02 - s \). Substituting these into the formation constant expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02 - s}{s^2}
\]

Given that \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \) is very large (\( 5 \times 10^{10} \)), the dissociation \( s \) will be very small compared to 0.02 M. Thus, \( 0.02 - s \approx 0.02 \). The equation simplifies to:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{s^2}
\]

Solving for \( s^2 \):

\[
s^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
s = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
