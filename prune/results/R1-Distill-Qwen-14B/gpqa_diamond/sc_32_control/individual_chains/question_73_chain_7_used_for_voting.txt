Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that at high speeds, like a significant fraction of the speed of light, you can't just use classical mechanics; you have to use special relativity. So, let me think about what I know.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. Oh wait, I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

First, the relative speed. I remember that when objects are moving at relativistic speeds, their relative speed isn't just the difference of their velocities like in classical mechanics. Because of the way velocities add in relativity, it's more complicated. So I can't just do 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c and think that's it. No, I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

Wait, the formula is v_rel = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²), where u is the speed of one object and v is the speed of the other. But wait, I should check which one is moving faster relative to the other. Oh yeah, in this case, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, the second at 0.5c, so from the perspective of the second astronaut, the first is approaching at a certain speed.

Wait, no, the relative speed is how fast one sees the other moving. So if astronaut A is moving at u = 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at v = 0.5c in the same direction, then from B's frame, what is the speed of A?

Wait no, wait. Actually, both are moving in the same direction. So if I'm in the frame of astronaut B (v = 0.5c), what is the speed of astronaut A? Because A is moving faster in the same direction, so from B's perspective, A is moving away or approaching? Wait, no, same direction. So from B's frame, A is moving at (u - v)/(1 - u v / c²).

Wait, u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. So substituting, (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Calculating numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 = (1/7) c ≈ 0.1428c. So about 0.14c, which is one of the options. Looking back, option C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's either C or D.

Now, for the total energy. The total energy of the system would be the sum of their relativistic energies. Each astronaut's energy is gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut, mass 2m, moving at 0.6c. Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.25)) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding them together: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So about 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option B has E=4.96, which is lower. Option D has E=5 mc², which is lower than 5.96.

So the correct answer should be option C: v_rel=0.14c and E≈5.96 mc².

Wait, but wait a second. The question says "the total energy of the system". Oh wait, in relativity, the total energy isn't simply the sum of the individual energies in that frame, because energy is frame-dependent. But in the context of this problem, I think they're asking for the sum of their energies in the same frame—probably the rest frame where the system's total momentum is zero. Or wait, no, perhaps they're just asking each astronaut's energy in the lab frame and summing them. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says the astronauts are moving in the positive x-direction. So from the lab frame, each has their own energy. The lab frame would have their individual energies, so E_total = E1 + E2.

Wait, I think that's correct. Because from the lab frame, each astronaut has their own kinetic energy, and the total energy is their sum. So my calculation above would be correct.

So E_total is about 5.96 mc², which matches option C.

So the correct answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relativistic relative speed and total energy of the system.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) (velocity of the first astronaut) and \( v = 0.5c \) (velocity of the second astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut:
- Mass: \( 2m \)
- Velocity: \( 0.6c \)
- \( \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25 \)
- Energy: \( E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2 \)

#### Second Astronaut:
- Mass: \( 3m \)
- Velocity: \( 0.5c \)
- \( \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547 \)
- Energy: \( E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2 \)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
- Option A: \( v_{\text{rel}} = 1.1c, E = mc^2 \) — Incorrect, as the relative speed and energy are not consistent.
- Option B: \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.1c, E = 4.96mc^2 \) — Incorrect, as the relative speed and energy are not consistent.
- Option C: \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c, E = 5.96mc^2 \) — Correct, as both the relative speed and total energy match the calculations.
- Option D: \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c, E = 5mc^2 \) — Incorrect, as the total energy is inconsistent.

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **C**, as it matches both the relative speed \( 0.14c \) and the total energy \( 5.96mc^2 \).
