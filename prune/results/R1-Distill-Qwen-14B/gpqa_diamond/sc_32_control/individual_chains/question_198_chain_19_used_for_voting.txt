Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the SCN^- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16.

Wait, wait. Stability constant, right. So each β corresponds to the formation of a complex with a certain number of SCN^- ligands. So β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)₂, and so on up to β4. So the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^3+, [Co(SCN)₃]^4+, [Co(SCN)₄]^5+.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. Dithiocyanato means two SCN ligands, so that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^(3+) complex. So I need to find the fraction of Co that's in the form of [Co(SCN)₂]^(3+), and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

I remember that when dealing with stability constants, the fraction of each species can be found by considering the formation of complexes step by step. Maybe I should write down the possible complexes and their respective formation steps.

The general approach is to calculate the concentration of each complex relative to the free Co²+ ion. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the species: Co²+ plus each complex.

But wait, the total concentration c(Co) is 10^-2 M. So the sum [Co²+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)₂]³+ + [Co(SCN)₃]⁴+ + [Co(SCN)₄]⁵+ = 0.01 M.

Thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the cobalt concentration, so I might assume that the SCN^- is in excess and doesn't change much. But I'm not sure yet.

The stability constants are given as β values. The β for each complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of that complex from the previous one. For example:

β1 = [Co(SCN)]+/[Co²+][SCN^-]
β2 = [Co(SCN)₂]^3+ / ([Co(SCN)]+ [SCN^-])
β3 = [Co(SCN)₃]^4+ / ([Co(SCN)₂]^3+ [SCN^-])
β4 = [Co(SCN)₄]^5+ / ([Co(SCN)₃]^4+ [SCN^-])

Wait, no. Actually, the overall formation constants (Kf) for each complex would be the product of the β values up to that step. For example, the overall K for [Co(SCN)]+ is β1. For [Co(SCN)₂]^3+, it's β1*β2, right? Because each β is the stepwise formation constant.

So the overall K for each complex would be:

K1 = β1 = 9
K2 = β1 * β2 = 9 * 40 = 360
K3 = β1 * β2 * β3 = 9*40*63 = let's see... 9*40=360, 360*63=22680
K4 = β1*β2*β3*β4 = 22680 * 16 = 362880.

Wait, but wait. No, I think I got that wrong. Because each β is the stepwise constant. So the overall K for the nth complex is the product of β1 to βn.

So the formation constant for [Co(SCN)]+ is β1 =9.

For [Co(SCN)₂]^3+ it's β1*β2=9*40=360.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)₃]^4+ would have K=9*40*63= 9*40=360; 360*63=22680.

And [Co(SCN)₄]^5+ would be 9*40*63*16= 22680 *16= 362880.

But wait, another approach is to model the fraction of each species. The fraction of each complex is determined by the ratio of their Kf values and the [SCN^-] concentration.

Wait, let me think. The fraction of each complex (fn) can be calculated using the formula:

fn = K_n / (1 + sum from i=1 to 4 of K_i)

But wait, each K_i is the overall formation constant for the ith complex. Because for each complex, the formation depends on the addition of each SCN- step.

So if the total concentration is c = [Co²+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)₂]^3+ + [Co(SCN)₃]^4+ + [Co(SCN)₄]^5+

But considering the formation constants, perhaps each complex's concentration is proportional to the product of the β's up to that point and [SCN^-]^(n), where n is the number of ligands.

Wait, the general formula for the fraction of each species is:

fn = (K_n * [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + sum_{i=1 to 4} K_i [SCN^-]^i )

Wait, no. Because for each complex, the concentration is [Co]_total multiplied by (β1 β2 ... βn) [SCN]^n / (1 + sum_{i=0}^4 (β1 β2 ... βi) [SCN]^i )

Wait, maybe it's better to model each species' concentration in terms of the free Co²+.

Let me denote [Co²+] = x.

Then:

[Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 * x [SCN^-]
= β1 x [SCN]
=9 x (0.1) = 0.9 x

[Co(SCN)₂]^3+ = β2 * [Co(SCN)]^+ [SCN^-]
= β2 * (β1 x [SCN]) [SCN]
= β1 β2 x [SCN]^2
=9 *40 x (0.1)^2 = 360 x * 0.01 = 3.6 x

[Co(SCN)₃]^4+ = β3 * [Co(SCN)₂]^3+ [SCN]
= β3 * (β1 β2 x [SCN]^2) [SCN]
= β1 β2 β3 x [SCN]^3
=9*40*63 x (0.1)^3 
= 22680 x * 0.001 = 22.68 x

[Co(SCN)₄]^5+ = β4 * [Co(SCN)3]^4+ [SCN]
= β4 * (β1 β2 β3 x [SCN]^3) [SCN]
= β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN]^4
=9*40*63*16 x (0.1)^4
=362880 x * 0.0001 = 36.288 x

Now, the total Co concentration is:

x + 0.9x + 3.6x +22.68x +36.288x = 0.01 M

Adding them up:

x(1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288) = x * (1+0.9=1.9; 1.9+3.6=5.5; 5.5+22.68=28.18; 28.18+36.288=64.468) 

So 64.468 x = 0.01 M → x = 0.01 /64.468 ≈ 0.00015506 M

So [Co²+] is approximately 1.5506e-4 M.

Now, the concentration of each complex:

[CoSCN+] = 0.9x = 0.9 * 1.5506e-4 ≈ 1.3955e-4 M

[Co(SCN)₂] =3.6x ≈ 5.582e-4 M

[Co(SCN)₃] =22.68x ≈ 3.524e-3 M

[Co(SCN)₄] =36.288x ≈5.619e-3 M

Wait, but wait, let me sum these all up to check:

1.5506e-4 +1.3955e-4 = 2.946e-4

+5.582e-4 → 8.528e-4

+3.524e-3 →4.376e-3

+5.619e-3 →1.0003e-2 M

Which is close to 0.01 M (since we have rounding), so that seems correct.

Now, the question is about the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]^3+, which is the dithiocyanato complex.

So [Co(SCN)₂] =5.582e-4 M

Total Co = 0.01 M.

So the fraction is (5.582e-4) / 0.01 = 0.05582 → 5.582% → wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are 16.9%, 25.6%, 38.1%, etc.

Hmm, that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, let me go back. Did I calculate the fractions correctly? Because I considered each complex's concentration as K_n multiplied by x, but perhaps I should model the fractions relative to the total.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the formation constants and calculate the fraction of each species.

Another approach is to consider the distribution of the species based on the stability constants and the ligand concentration.

The general formula for the fraction of each species is:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n ) / D

where D is the sum from m=0 to 4 of (β1 β2 ... βm [SCN]^m )

Wait, but in this case, m can be 0 (free Co²+), 1, 2, 3,4.

So D = 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4

Because the free ion is 1 (no complexes), then each complex adds another term.

So let me compute each term.

Given [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

Compute each term:

Term 0 (free Co²+): 1

Term 1: β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9

Term2: β1 β2 [SCN]^2 =9*40*(0.1)^2= 360 *0.01=3.6

Term3: β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3= 22680 *0.001=22.68

Term4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288

Now, sum all these terms:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

+3.6 →5.5

+22.68 →28.18

+36.288 →64.468

So D=64.468.

The fraction of the second complex (n=2) is f2= term2 / D =3.6 /64.468 ≈0.0557 or 5.57%.

That's about 5.57%, which is about 5.6%, but the options are much higher. So that can't be right. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Because the formation constants are stepwise, perhaps the overall K for each complex is not just the product of β's up to that point. Or maybe I should be using the stability constant differently.

Wait, another way to look at it: the fraction of each complex is determined by the product of β's up to that point multiplied by [SCN]^n, all divided by the sum of all such terms.

Wait, but according to what I did earlier, that approach gives around 5.57%, which doesn't match any of the options.

But the options are in the 16% to 42% range. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider that the stability constants are for the overall complexes, not stepwise. Oh wait wait! Or perhaps the β's given are the overall stability constants for each complex.

Wait, wait. Wait, the question says "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16." So which complexes do these correspond to?

Hmm, perhaps β1 is the stability constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^3+, β3 for [Co(SCN)₃]^4+, β4 for [Co(SCN)₄]^5+.

So each β is the overall K for that specific complex, not stepwise.

In that case, the approach changes. Because then, each β is the overall K for the formation of that complex, not stepwise.

So the formation of [Co(SCN)]^+ has K1=9.

Formation of [Co(SCN)₂]^3+ has K2=40.

Wait, but no, because K for [Co(SCN)₂]^3+ would be the product of K1 and K2_step, where K2_step is the stepwise addition of the second SCN.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should clarify what the given β values represent.

Wait, the problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16."

Stability constant (β) for a complex [Co(L)n] is defined as:

β = [Co(L)n] / ([Co²+][L]^n)

So for each complex:

β1 = [Co(SCN)]^+ / ([Co²+][SCN^-])

β2 = [Co(SCN)₂]^3+ / ([Co²+][SCN^-]^2)

β3= [Co(SCN)3]^4+ / ([Co²+][SCN^-]^3)

β4= [Co(SCN)4]^5+ / ([Co²+][SCN^-]^4)

So each β is the overall stability constant for that particular complex.

In that case, the formation of each complex is independent in the sense that each is a separate process.

Wait, but that might not be correct. Because when you form [Co(SCN)₂]^3+, it's a two-step process: first, Co²+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+, then [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)₂]^3+.

So the overall K for [Co(SCN)₂]^3+ would be K1*K2, where K1 is the step for first SCN, K2 for the second.

But the given β2 is 40, which would be K1*K2=40.

Similarly, β1=K1=9.

So then K1=9, K2=40/9 ≈4.444.

Hmm, but if that's the case, then the approach would be different.

So let me think again. Each βn is the overall K for the nth complex.

So for [Co(SCN)]^+, K1=9.

For [Co(SCN)₂]^3+, K2=40.

Wait, but that would imply that the step from [CoSCN]^+ to [Co(SCN)₂]^3+ has a stepwise constant K2_step = K2/K1 =40/9≈4.444.

But I think the problem is that I'm mixing up the definitions. Let me make sure.

If β1 is the stability constant for [Co(SCN)]^+:

β1 = [Co(SCN)]^+ / ([Co²+][SCN^-]).

Similarly, β2 is the stability constant for [Co(SCN)₂]^3+:

β2 = [Co(SCN)₂]^3+ / ([Co²+][SCN^-]^2).

So for [Co(SCN)₂]^3+, the concentration is [Co²+] β2 [SCN^-]^2.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)]^+ = [Co²+] β1 [SCN^-].

But wait, that can't be right. Because if you have [Co(SCN)₂]^3+, it's formed by adding a second SCN^- to [Co(SCN)]^+.

So perhaps the correct way is to model each complex's concentration in terms of the lower complexes.

Let me consider the formation sequences:

Co²+ + SCN^- ↔ CoSCN^+ ; K1 = β1 =9.

CoSCN^+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)₂^3+ ; K2 = β2 =40.

Wait, no. Because the overall K for [Co(SCN)₂]^3+ would be K1 * K2, where K1 is the first step, K2 is the second step.

So K_total for [Co(SCN)₂]^3+ is K1*K2 = 9 *40=360.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)3]^4+ has K3=63. But wait, what's K3? It must be the step from [Co(SCN)₂]^3+ to [Co(SCN)3]^4+.

So K3 is the stepwise constant for adding the third SCN-.

So K3=63 would imply that [Co(SCN)3]^4+ = [Co(SCN)₂]^3+ * K3 [SCN^-].

Similarly, K4=16 is the step for the fourth SCN-.

So in this case, each βn is the stepwise constant for adding the nth SCN^- to form the next complex.

So the overall K for each complex is the product of β1 to βn.

So [Co(SCN)]^+ = [Co²+] * β1 [SCN^-].

[Co(SCN)2]^3+ = [Co²+] * β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2.

[Co(SCN)3]^4+ = [Co²+] * β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3.

[Co(SCN)4]^5+ = [Co²+] * β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4.

So in this model, the concentrations are:

[Co²+] = x.

[CoSCN+] = x * β1 * [SCN^-] = 9 *x *0.1 =0.9 x.

[Co(SCN)₂]^3+ =x * β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 = x *9*40 * (0.1)^2 = x *360 *0.01= 3.6 x.

[Co(SCN)3]^4+ =x *9*40*63 * (0.1)^3 = x * 22680 * 0.001 = 22.68 x.

[Co(SCN)4]^5+ =x *9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4 = x * 362880 *0.0001 =36.288 x.

So the total Co concentration is x +0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x = x(1+0.9+3.6+22.68+36.288)= x *64.468 =0.01 M.

So x =0.01 /64.468 ≈ 0.00015506 M.

Now, the concentration of each complex:

[Co²+] =1.5506e-4 M.

[CoSCN+] =0.9 *1.5506e-4 =1.3955e-4.

[Co(SCN)₂]=3.6 *1.5506e-4=5.582e-4.

[Co(SCN)3]=22.68 *1.5506e-4=3.524e-3.

[Co(SCN)4]=36.288 *1.5506e-4=5.619e-3.

Total Co: sum the concentrations:

1.5506e-4 +1.3955e-4 =2.9461e-4

+5.582e-4 →8.5281e-4

+3.524e-3 →4.3792e-3

+5.619e-3 →1.0003e-2, which is ~0.01, so correct.

So the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]^3+ is (5.582e-4) /0.01 =0.05582 →5.582% → ~5.6%.

But none of the answer options are close to 5.6%. So I must be making a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the question, the options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Hmm, 5.6% isn't an option. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the stability constants are for the overall complexes, not stepwise.

So the formation constants are given as:

β1 for [CoSCN]^+,

β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^3+,

β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^4+,

β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^5+.

So each β represents the K for the entire complex, not stepwise.

In that case, the concentration of [CoSCN]^+ would be [Co²+] * β1 [SCN].

The concentration of [Co(SCN)₂]^3+ would be [Co²+] * β2 [SCN]^2.

Wait, but that can't be right because [Co(SCN)₂]^3+ is a higher complex than [CoSCN]^+.

But wait, if that's the case, then each complex's concentration is independent of the others, which doesn't make sense because the formation of [Co(SCN)₂]^3+ depends on [CoSCN]^+.

Alternatively, perhaps the way to model this is to consider all possible complexes and compute the fractions based on their overall stability constants.

So for each complex, the concentration would be [Co]_total * (βn [SCN]^n) / (sum over all m (βm [SCN]^m) +1 )

Wait, that's a different approach. Let me see.

The formula would be:

fn = (βn [SCN]^n) / (1 + sum_{m=1 to4} βm [SCN]^m )

So, for each n from 1 to4.

So let's compute each term in the denominator.

Compute each βn [SCN]^n.

β1 [SCN]^1=9 *0.1=0.9

β2 [SCN]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4

β3 [SCN]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063

β4 [SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016

So the denominator D is 1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 = 1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So D=2.3646.

Now, the fraction f2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^3+ is:

f2=β2 [SCN]^2 / D =0.4 /2.3646 ≈0.169, or 16.9%.

Ah, that's option D)16.9%.

So according to this approach, the percentage is around 16.9%, which is option D.

But why did this approach give a different result than the previous one?

Ah, because in the first approach, I treated each β as a stepwise constant, whereas the second approach treats each β as the overall K for the entire complex. But which one is correct?

Wait, the problem states that β1, β2, β3, β4 are the stability constants of the complexes. So each βn is the overall stability constant for the nth complex.

So in that case, [Co(SCN)₂]^3+ would have a stability constant β2=40, meaning:

β2= [Co(SCN)₂]^3+ / ( [Co²+][SCN^-]^2 )

So [Co(SCN)₂]^3+ = β2 [Co²+][SCN^-]^2.

But then, how do you relate all the species? Because each complex's concentration is independent of the others, but that's not possible because the same Co²+ is used.

Wait, no. The correct approach is to consider that the total Co is the sum of all species:

Co²+ + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)₂]^3+ + [Co(SCN)3]^4+ + [Co(SCN)4]^5+ =0.01

Each complex's concentration is given by:

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 [Co²+][SCN^-]

[Co(SCN)₂]^3+ = β2 [Co²+][SCN^-]^2

[Co(SCN)3]^4+ = β3 [Co²+][SCN^-]^3

[Co(SCN)4]^5+ = β4 [Co²+][SCN^-]^4

So each complex is directly proportional to [Co²+].

Let me denote [Co²+] as x.

Then:

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 x [SCN] =9x *0.1 =0.9x.

[Co(SCN)₂]^3+ =40x*(0.1)^2=40x*0.01=0.4x.

[Co(SCN)3]^4+ =63x*(0.1)^3=63x*0.001=0.063x.

[Co(SCN)4]^5+ =16x*(0.1)^4=16x*0.0001=0.0016x.

So total Co:

x +0.9x +0.4x +0.063x +0.0016x =x*(1+0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016)=x *2.3646=0.01.

So x=0.01 /2.3646 ≈ 0.004232 M.

Wait, no, that can't be right because 0.004232 is 4.232e-3, which is higher than the total Co concentration of 0.01 M.

Wait, no. Because x is the concentration of Co²+, and the sum is 2.3646 x =0.01 →x=0.01/2.3646= ~0.004232 M.

Wait, but that's impossible because the total Co is 0.01 M, so [Co²+] can't be 0.004232. Because 0.004232 is less than 0.01, but the sum is 2.3646 x =0.01.

Wait, no, 2.3646 x =0.01 → x=0.01 /2.3646 ≈0.004232 M.

Then, the concentrations of each complex are:

[CoSCN]^+ =0.9x =0.9 *0.004232≈0.003809 M.

[Co(SCN)₂]^3+ =0.4x≈0.4 *0.004232≈0.001693 M.

[Co(SCN)3]^4+ =0.063x≈0.000265 M.

[Co(SCN)4]^5+ =0.0016x≈0.00000677 M.

Wait, but wait, adding these up:

x =0.004232

[CoSCN]^+≈0.003809 → total so far: 0.008041.

Plus [Co(SCN)₂]^3+ → 0.001693 → 0.009734.

Plus [Co(SCN)3]^4+→0.000265 →0.009999.

Plus [Co(SCN)4]^5+→0.00000677 →0.01000577 M.

Which is close to 0.01 M, considering rounding.

So the concentration of [Co(SCN)₂]^3+ is 0.001693 M.

The percentage is (0.001693 /0.01) *100=16.93% → ~16.9%, which matches option D.

So the correct answer should be D)16.9%.

So why did the first approach give a different answer? Because in the first approach, I assumed that each β was a stepwise constant and multiplied all previous βs to get the overall K for each complex, which led to a much lower percentage. But in reality, since each β is an overall K for that specific complex, the correct approach is to model each complex's concentration as βn [Co²+][SCN]^n, sum all species, and find the fraction.

Thus, the correct answer is D)16.9%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]³⁺, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants provided and the given concentrations. The stability constants are:

- β₁ = 9 (for [Co(SCN)]⁺)
- β₂ = 40 (for [Co(SCN)₂]³⁺)
- β₃ = 63 (for [Co(SCN)₃]⁴⁺)
- β₄ = 16 (for [Co(SCN)₄]⁵⁺)

The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The fraction of each cobalt species is determined using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{1 + \sum_{m=1}^4 \beta_m [\text{SCN}^-]^m}
\]

where \( f_n \) is the fraction of the cobalt species with \( n \) thiocyanato ligands.

### Step 1: Compute the terms in the denominator
The denominator \( D \) is the sum of the contributions from all species, including the free cobalt ion ([Co²⁺]):

\[
D = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4
\]

Substituting the values:

- \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
- \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4 \)
- \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063 \)
- \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016 \)

\[
D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 2: Compute the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]³⁺
The fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]³⁺ is:

\[
