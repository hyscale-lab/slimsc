Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to work through it step by step. So, the question is about identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, that's like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows ester groups, which means there's an -O-CO-O- or an -O-CO-R group. Wait, no, esters are typically R-O-CO-R', right? So, the IR peak suggests an ester is present.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: six signals. Two are for aromatic protons. So, the aromatic ring has two different types of protons. Since it's di-substituted, the substitution pattern could be either para, ortho, or meta. But in para substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other, leading to two sets of equivalent protons, which would show as one signal each for the two equivalent pairs. But wait, in this case, the NMR shows two signals for aromatic-H. Hmm, that suggests that the substituents are in a position that creates two different sets of aromatic protons. So, if it's para substitution, the two substituents would make the ring symmetric, resulting in two sets of aromatic protons, each with two equivalent H's. Or maybe meta substitution? Wait, no, in meta substitution, you have three different substituent positions, but the ring symmetry would actually lead to two types of aromatic H's. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. For a di-substituted benzene, the substitution can be ortho, meta, or para.

Ortho substitution: substituents are adjacent. The ring has a certain symmetry. The aromatic protons would have two groups of equivalent H's. So, in NMR, two signals for the aromatic H's. That fits the data.

Meta substitution: substituents are at positions 1 and 3. The ring would have two sets of equivalent H's. So again, two signals.

Para substitution: substituents are opposite each other. Then, each substituent is adjacent to two H's, which are equivalent. So, the aromatic protons would be split into two sets. Like, the H's ortho to substituents could be equivalent, and the H's meta to substituents (which are actually para to each other) could be another set. So, two signals. Oh wait, no, in para substitution, the di-substituted benzene would have two equivalent H's adjacent to each substituent and two equivalent H's opposite each substituent. Wait, but that might give two signals for the aromatic H's.

So, the NMR data can't distinguish between ortho, meta, or para based on the number of aromatic signals. So, maybe I'll need to look at the other parts of the NMR for more clues.

The NMR also shows two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are the ones on a double bond, like in an alkene. One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. Hmm. So, maybe the molecule has an ester group attached to a vinyl group.

Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O-R, but if the substituent on the benzene is an ester, like O-CO-O-R, but that doesn't have a vinyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group connected to a vinyl group. For example, something like O-CO-O-R, where R is a vinyl group. Or maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester, like CH2=CH-O-CO-R or something.

Wait, what if the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester? Like, perhaps an allyl ester? Or maybe it's a substituent that's an ester with a double bond adjacent.

Alternatively, think about the structure. Let's say the benzene ring has two substituents. One substituent is an ester group, and another substituent is a vinyl group, or maybe both substituents are ester groups? No, wait, the ester group is part of the substituent. Let me think: the molecule could be something like benzyl acetate, but that's a mono-substituted benzene.

Wait, no. The compound has two substituents. So, perhaps each substituent is an ester group? No, wait, that would require two ester groups, but the IR only shows one peak for the ester. So probably, one substituent is an ester group, and the other substituent is something else.

Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for -CH3 groups. So, two sets of methyl groups. Each with a different environment.

So, let's think about what substituents would lead to vinyl protons and methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester and an allyl group. Or, maybe one substituent is an ester group, and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group.

Wait, let me think of the possible structure. Suppose one substituent on the benzene is an ester group, like O-CO-O-R, where R is something. The other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. But how?

Alternatively, let's consider a structure where one substituent is an ester, and the other substituent is an allyl group. So, for example, the benzene has an ester group and a vinyl group attached. Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl protons. So, perhaps the vinyl group is part of the substituent.

Let me think of the substituent as being an ester attached to a vinyl group. For example, an allyl ester: something like CH2=CHCOO- attached to the benzene. Wait, no, that's a vinyl group attached to an ester.

Wait, another possibility: one substituent is a methyl ester (like O-CO-OCH3) and the other substituent is a vinyl group. But how would that look?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a propenyl group (allyl group). Let's think about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a group that has both vinyl and methyl groups, such as a propenyl group (CH2=CHCH2-), but I'm not sure.

Wait, the NMR shows that the vinyl protons are split into a doublet and a doublet of quartets.

Doublets occur when a proton has only one neighboring proton. Doublets of quartets (doublet of quartet) would happen when a proton is next to another group that has two neighboring protons, perhaps.

Wait, vinyl protons are typically split because they are adjacent to another proton. For example, in a simple ethylene group (CH2=CH2), each CH2 group would have protons that are split into a quartet because each proton is adjacent to two equivalent protons. But in a more substituted case, maybe there's coupling beyond the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group, like CH2=CHCH2- attached to the benzene. Let's consider that.

In such a structure, the protons on the CH2=CHCH2 group would have different environments. The protons on the CH2 adjacent to the benzene (let's say position 1) would be next to the CH2=CH- group. The protons on the CH2 next to the double bond (position 2) would have different coupling.

Wait, another approach: think about the number of signals.

The NMR shows:

- Two aromatic H signals.
- Two vinyl H signals (doublet and doublet of quartets).
- Two CH3 signals.

So, the substituents on the benzene probably include an ester group and a group that has a vinyl chain and methyl groups.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the substituent is a methyl ester (like O-CO-OCH3) and another substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. But wait, where would the methyl groups come from?

Wait, the presence of two methyl signals suggests that there are two different methyl groups. So, perhaps one substituent is an ester group, and the other substituent is an isopropyl group or a group with two different methyls.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group connected to another group that has a methyl. Like, maybe the substituent is a CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3? No, that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester group (like O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3) and another substituent is a methyl group. Wait, but then the NMR would show more CH2 groups, but the question says no CH2 signals. Hmm.

Wait, if the substituent is a vinyl group (like CH2=CH-) attached to the benzene, then the adjacent CH2 would have two protons. But the NMR shows no CH2 signals, so that's conflicting. Unless the substituent doesn't have any CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester group. For example, the substituent is -O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that would include CH2 groups which would show up in the NMR as CH2 signals, but the question says there are none.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. Like, perhaps it's a CH2=CH-CO-O- something. Let me see.

Wait, another approach: the ester group is R-O-CO-O-R'. No, wait, more accurately, an ester is R-O-CO-R', where R and R' can be various groups. So, if the substituent is an ester, perhaps O-CO-O-R, where R is a group that includes a vinyl and methyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester group. For example, benzene with an ester group where the R group is a vinyl group. So, for example, benzene-O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3 would have more CH2 groups, but wait, no, the substituent would be O-CO-O-R, where R is a vinyl group.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a propenoate ester. For example, the group is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-O. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. But that would have CH2 groups in the R group, which should show up as CH2 signals, but the NMR doesn't show any. So maybe R doesn't have any CH2 groups.

Wait, R could be a methyl group. So, the substituent is O-CO-OCH3. So one substituent is a methyl ester (like OMe group attached via an ester, making it O-CO-OCH3). Then, what about the other substituent?

The other substituent would have to account for the vinyl protons and the methyl groups. So, maybe the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. Like CH2=CH-CO-O-? No, that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl ester. Wait, like a CH2CH2 group connected to an ester.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like:

Benzene ring with two substituents: one is O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester), and the other is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, like CH2=CHCH3. But wait, that would make the other substituent a propenyl group.

Wait, if the substituent is CH2=CHCH3 attached to the benzene via a single bond, then the NMR would pick up the protons on the CH2=CHCH3 group.

So, let's think about that substituent. The structure would be benzene-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's an ethyl group. Wait, no, if the substituent is CH2=CHCH3, that's an allyl group attached to the benzene.

But in that case, the protons on the CH2=CHCH3 would be as follows: the CH2 adjacent to the benzene (let's say it's the CH2 in CH2=CHCH3) would have two protons, and the CH2 next to the double bond (CH2=CH-) would have two protons as well, but each in a different environment.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl H signals. So, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached to another group. Let's say the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3. No, that would complicate the structure, but perhaps that's a possibility.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenyl group attached via the oxygen, like O-CH2-CH2-CH2-O-CO-OCH3. No, that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group connected to a methyl group. Like, the substituent is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3. But then, the CH2 groups in the substituent would show as CH2 signals, but the NMR doesn't have any, so that can't be.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an ester group with a vinyl group attached. For example, the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. No, that's an ethyl ester, but that would have CH2 groups which are not present in the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl ester. So, the substituent could be CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3. But that might be more of an ether linkage.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach. The molecular formula is one of the choices: C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

The benzene ring has six carbons. Each substituent adds to the formula.

So, the di-substituted benzene would have two substituents. Let's say each substituent contributes some carbons.

The ester group is O-CO-O-R. The R group will contribute to the formula.

If one substituent is an ester (like O-CO-O-R), then the R group contributes (n carbons), and the other substituent would be another group, say M.

The total formula is C12 or C11, so let's do the math.

Benzene is C6H6. Each substituent will replace a hydrogen.

Each substituent adds its own formula.

The ester group O-CO-O-R contributes (R being an alkyl group, perhaps). So, if R is a methyl group (CH3), then the ester substituent is O-CO-OCH3. That's 3 carbons (from the methyl). So, substituent is O-CO-OCH3: so that's 3 O's? Wait, no, O-CO-OCH3 is O, C, O. Wait, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So, in this case, R is H (from benzene) and R' is methyl. So, the substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which is 2 oxygen atoms in the ester group.

So, the other substituent must contribute to the formula.

The other substituent is something that has vinyl protons and methyl groups.

Wait, the NMR shows two CH3 groups. So, perhaps that substituent has two methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl methyl group. For example, a group like CH2=CHCH2CH3? No, that's too long and would have CH2 groups, which the NMR doesn't show.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. Like CH2=CHCH2CH3, but that's butenyl, which again has CH2 groups. Hmm.

Wait, what if the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group via oxygen? Like OCH2CH2CH3? No, that's an ether, but not a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O- something. But that might complicate the structure.

Alternatively, considering the NMR, the presence of two vinyl H signals suggests that there are two different types of vinyl protons. One is a doublet (coupled with one other proton), and the other is a doublet of quartets (coupled with two protons, perhaps).

For example, in a structure like CH2=CHCH2-, the middle CH2 group would have protons that are split into quartets due to coupling with the CH2= group. But the end CH2 would have a quartet as well.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group (CH2=CHCH2-). So, the substituent is attached to the benzene as CH2=CHCH2-.

In that case, the protons on the CH2= would be a doublet, and the CH2 next to them would be a quartet. So, the NMR would show two vinyl H signals: one doublet (from CH2=) and one quartet (from CH2 next to it). But wait, in the substituent CH2=CHCH2- attached to benzene, the protons on the CH2 next to the benzene would be split by the adjacent CH2= group.

Wait, the substituent would be CH2=CHCH2-. The vinyl protons are on the CH2=CH- part. The protons on the CH2= would be next to the CH group, which has two protons. So, each proton on CH2= would couple with the two protons on CH, leading to a quartet. But in the NMR, one of the vinyl signals is a doublet, so perhaps that's from the CH group.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-, but that's not vinyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group connected to a methyl group, like CH2=CHCH3. Then, the protons on the CH2= would be a doublet (each coupled with the two protons on the adjacent CH), and the protons on the CH would be a quartet (coupled with the two on CH2). Wait, that makes sense.

So, substituent structure: CH2=CHCH3.

In this case, the two protons on the CH2= would be a doublet (each coupled with the two protons on the CH), and the two protons on the CH would be a quartet (coupled with the CH2). So, the NMR would show two signals for vinyl H: one doublet and one quartet.

Wait, but the question says two signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the CH2=CHCH3 group would have the CH2 protons as a quartet, but the CH protons as a doublet of quartets? Or maybe I'm mixing up the splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a trans or cis configuration that affects the splitting.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester group. Let's say the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, that would have CH2 groups, which aren't present.

Wait, another angle: the absence of CH2 groups in the NMR suggests that any substituents don't have any CH2 groups. So, substituents must be either CH3, or have no CH2s.

So, the substituents can't have any CH2 groups. So, for example, an isopropyl group (CH(CH3)2) doesn't have any CH2 groups. Similarly, a methyl group (CH3) doesn't have any.

So, if the substituent is an ester group (O-CO-O-R) where R is a methyl group (O-CO-OCH3), that would add one methyl group.

The other substituent must be a group that has a vinyl part and another methyl group, but without any CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group via a double bond. Like CH2=CHCH3. But that would mean the substituent is CH2=CHCH3, which is a propenyl group.

Wait, that substituent has a CH2 group (the CH2= part), which would produce a CH2 signal in the NMR. But the NMR doesn't show any CH2 signals, so that's a problem.

Hmm, so perhaps the substituent doesn't have any CH2 groups. That would require that any substituent is either a methyl group or a group where all CH2 groups are elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group and a vinyl group attached to the benzene. But that would require two substituents, which is the case here. So, one substituent is the ester group (O-CO-OCH3), and the other is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, but that would require a CH2 group.

This is getting confusing. Let me approach this by looking at the molecular formulas.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2
B) C12H14O2
C) C12H12O2
D) C11H12O2

The benzene ring has 6 carbons. Each substituent adds carbons.

If the ester substituent is O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester), that's 3 carbons.

The other substituent must account for the remaining carbons.

The ester group is O-CO-OCH3, which contributes 3 carbons. So, 6 (benzene) + 3 + x = total carbons.

Looking at the options:

Option B: C12H14O2. 12 carbons.

So, 6 (benzene) + 3 (ester) + x (other substituent) = 12 → x=3.

So, other substituent has 3 carbons.

So, what substituent with 3 carbons would have vinyl protons and two methyl groups? Because the NMR shows two CH3 signals.

Wait, if the substituent is CH2=CHCH3 (propenyl group), that's 3 carbons. But that would have a CH2 group, which the NMR doesn't show.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group with two methyl groups and a double bond, but without any CH2 groups. Wait, that's not possible. Because any double bond would require adjacent CH2 or CH groups.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a gem-dimethyl group attached to a double bond. Like CH2=C(CH3)2. That would be a substituent with 3 carbons: the C attached to the benzene is CH2, then double bond to C(CH3)2.

Wait, no, the substituent would be CH2=C(CH3)2. That's a 3-carbon substituent.

But then, the structure would have a substituent like -CH2-C(CH3)2, but wait, that's not a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH2 (ethylene group), but that's two carbons, but we need three.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methylene group (CH2) attached to something else, but that would include CH2 groups, which are not present.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane group with a double bond. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached to a double bond. Like CH2=CHCH3. But that's three carbons, but includes a CH2 group.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't have any CH2 signals. So, that can't be.

Hmm, maybe the substituent is a methyl group (CH3) attached to a double bond. Wait, but how? The substituent would need to be something like C(CH3)=CH2, but that's a 3-carbon group. The structure would be CH2=C(CH3)- attached to the benzene. So, substituent is CH2=C(CH3)-.

In that case, the substituent is a vinyl group with a methyl substituent. So, the substituent is CH2=C(CH3)-.

So, the protons on the CH2= would be a doublet (coupled with the CH(CH3)), and the CH(CH3) would have two H's, which would be split into a quartet (coupled with the two H's on CH2=). So, in the NMR, the CH2= would be a doublet, and the CH(CH3) would be a quartet. But the question says one is a doublet and the other is a doublet of quartets.

Wait, a doublet of quartets would mean that each proton is coupled with two different sets of protons. So, perhaps the CH2=CH- group is attached to another group that causes more splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is part of a ring. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the molecular formula.

If the substituent is O-CO-OCH3 (3 carbons) and another substituent is CH2=CHCH3 (3 carbons), then total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 3 + 3 = 12. So, the formula would be C12H(?)O2.

Benzene is C6H6. Each substituent replaces one H. So, two substituents would reduce the H count by two.

Each substituent: O-CO-OCH3 has 3 carbons and adds (for the substituent group): O-CO-OCH3 is from COOCH3. The substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which has 3 carbons (one from the benzene O, one from the COO, and one from the CH3). Wait, no, the substituent is attached to the benzene as an ester group: O-CO-OCH3. So, the substituent adds no additional carbons beyond the carbonyl and the methyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me think about the molecular formula again.

The benzene ring has 6 C and 6 H.

Each substituent adds C and H.

Ester substituent: -O-CO-OCH3.

This substituent contributes 3 C (the O, COO, and CH3). Wait, no, the ester group is O-CO-OCH3, which is three carbons (the methyl group) attached via the ester linkage. So, for the substituent, we add 3 C and ? H.

Wait, the ester group O-CO-OCH3 has the following structure: the benzene oxygen is connected to a carbonyl group, which is connected to an oxygen, which is connected to a methyl group.

So, the substituent is O-CO-OCH3: that's three carbons (the methyl group), two oxygens.

So, substituent contributes 3 C, and 3 H (from CH3). So, when added to benzene, the total would be 6 + 3 =9 C, plus whatever the other substituent contributes.

The other substituent must add 3 C (because our options are C11, C12, etc.). Benzene plus both substituents: 6 + 3 (ester) + 3 (other substituent) = 12 C. So, the formula would be C12H??O2.

Now, the other substituent is a three-carbon group with a vinyl part and two methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2=CHCH3 group. But that would have two CH2 groups, which the NMR doesn't show. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group attached to something else, but then that would have CH2 groups.

Hmm. Alternatively, the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-OCH3. But that would have an ether linkage, not an ester. Wait, but we already have an ester group. So, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl methyl ketone group. But that's getting too complicated.

Another thought: the substituent could be a gem-dimethyl group attached to a double bond. So, something like C(CH3)2=CH2 attached to the benzene. Wait, but that would have a CH2 group, which is not allowed.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about the degrees of unsaturation.

The molecular formula options:

For example, option B is C12H14O2.

Degrees of unsaturation: Each degree is a ring or double bond.

Degrees = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X (halogens) or N.

So for C12H14O2: (2*12 +2 -14 -0 +0)/2 = (26-14)/2 = 6.

So, 6 degrees: benzene ring (3), ester group (1 double bond), and the other substituent maybe has a double bond and some rings or other double bonds.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, looking at the NMR again: the two vinyl protons. So, perhaps the substituent has a double bond, leading to two sets of protons.

Putting it all together, perhaps the structure is:

Benzene ring with two substituents: one is O-CO-OCH3 (ester), and the other is a CH2=C(CH3)- group.

Wait, that substituent would be CH2=C(CH3)- attached to the benzene.

So, the substituent structure is CH2=C(CH3)-.

In that case, the protons on CH2= would be a doublet (coupled with the two H on CH(CH3)), and the H on CH(CH3) would be a quartet (coupled with the two H on CH2=). But the NMR shows one as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets.

Hmm, perhaps the CH(CH3) group's protons are split into a quartet due to coupling with the two H from CH2=, making a quartet. But in the NMR, it's described as a doublet of quartets, which is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, but arranged in a way that each H has different coupling. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropyl group, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group where the vinyl H are split by another group. For example, a group like CH2=CH-O-R, where R is something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ether group, like O-CH2-CH2-O- something. But I'm not sure.

At this point, maybe I should calculate the molecular formula for each possible structure.

Let me think, the structure has a benzene ring (6 C), one substituent is an ester group (O-CO-OCH3, which adds 3 C and 3 H), and another substituent must add 3 C and some H.

Wait, but the options have 11 or 12 C.

6 (benzene) + 3 (ester) + 3 (other substituent) = 12 C. So, that's option B (C12H14O2) or option C (C12H12O2).

Now, the ester group is O-CO-OCH3, which has a molecular formula of C3H6O2 (since it's O-CO-OCH3: carbons are 3, hydrogens are 3 (from CH3) + O's don't add H. Wait, the formula for O-CO-OCH3 is: O=C(OCH3)-O- (attached to benzene). So, the substituent's molecular formula is O-CO-OCH3, which is 3 C (COOCH3), 3 H (from CH3), and 3 O.

Wait, but the overall molecular formula would be benzene (C6H6) plus two substituents.

If the substituents are O-CO-OCH3 and CH2=CHCH3, then:

O-CO-OCH3 contributes 3 C, 3 H.

CH2=CHCH3 contributes 3 C, 5 H (since CH2=CHCH3 has 2 H on CH2, 2 H on CH, and 3 H on CH3? Wait, no, CH2=CHCH3 has 3 groups:

CH2= (two H), CH (two H), CH3 (three H). So total H from substituent: 2+2+3=7 H? No, because each substituent is attached to the benzene, so the CH2=CHCH3 would have the CH2 group attached to the benzene. So, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's an ethyl group, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CHCH2- attached to the benzene.

Wait, maybe I'm getting too tangled here. Let me try to count H's.

Benzene has 6 H. Each substituent replaces one H, so two substituents replace two H's.

Ester substituent: O-CO-OCH3. The substituent adds how many H? Let me see: the substituent is O-CO-OCH3. Benzene-O-CO-OCH3. The substituent has the CH3 group, which contributes 3 H.

So, substituent adds 3 H.

The other substituent is CH2=CHCH3. That substituent has 2 H on CH2=, 2 H on CH, and 3 H on CH3. So 7 H in total from that substituent.

But when attached to the benzene, the CH2=CHCH3 would have 2 H on the CH2 attached to the benzene, 2 H on the CH, and 3 H on CH3.

Wait, but that would mean the substituent contributes 2 + 2 +3=7 H.

So, total H in the molecule: 6 (benzene) - 2 (replaced by substituents) + substituent H.

Substituents contribute 3 (ester) +7 (vinyl) =10 H.

So, 6 -2 +10=14 H.

So, the formula would be C12H14O2.

Looking at the options, that's option B.

But let me check. The molecular formula would be:

Benzene (6 C) + O-CO-OCH3 (3 C) + CH2=CHCH3 (3 C) = 6+3+3=12 C.

Hydrogen: (6 benzene H) - 2 (substituted H) + 3 (ester substituent H) +7 (vinyl substituent H) =6-2+10=14 H.

Oxygen: ester has 2 O from COO and one O from the ester linkage. Wait, O-CO-OCH3 has three O's? Let me count: O-CO-O-CH3. So, that's three O's. Wait, no, the ester group is O-CO-O, so that's two O's: the oxygen in the COO group and the oxygen connecting to the benzene. Wait, no, the ester group is R-O-CO-O-R'. So, each ester has two O's in the ester linkage and one O in the carbonyl. Wait, no, the ester functional group is O-CO-O, so each ester has two oxygen atoms in the ester linkage.

Wait, no, maybe the ester is R-O-CO-R', so that's two O's: one in the O of the ether linkage, and the carbonyl O.

Wait, perhaps each ester group contributes two O's. So, the substituent O-CO-OCH3 contributes two O's, but the actual count would include the O from the benzene. Hmm, not sure. Let me double-check.

The ester group is O-CO-OCH3. So, for each ester group, the formula would be O2 in the substituent. So, the substituent O-CO-OCH3 contributes two O's (in the carbonyl and the ester oxygen) plus the O from the benzene-O. Wait, no, the benzene-O is part of the substituent, so the substituent brings in two O's.

Wait, maybe the overall formula for the substituent O-CO-OCH3 is C3H6O2.

Wait, let me calculate:

Each ester substituent (O-CO-OCH3) has:

- Benzene ring: C6H5-O- → that's part of the substituent.

But perhaps it's easier to think of the entire molecule.

The molecular formula would be:

C6 (benzene) + (O-CO-OCH3) → adds 3 C, 3 H, 2 O.

Plus the other substituent: let's say it's CH2=CHCH3, which adds 3 C, 7 H, 0 O.

So, total C:6 +3 +3=12.

H: (6 from benzene) - 2 (replaced H) +3 (ester) +7 (vinyl) =6-2=4; 4+3=7; 7+7=14.

O: 2 (from ester).

So, formula is C12H14O2.

Which matches option B: C12H14O2.

Now, considering the NMR: the vinyl H would have two signals. The substituent CH2=CHCH3 would have the CH2= group as a doublet (coupled with the adjacent CH group), and the CH group as a quartet (coupled with the CH2 and perhaps another group). But the NMR shows one doublet and one doublet of quartets.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3. But that would include O's and more carbons, which complicates the formula.

Wait, but I'm getting the molecular formula as C12H14O2, which is option B.

So, the answer should be option B.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group, as indicated by the FTIR spectrum. The 1H NMR spectrum provides the following key information:

1. **Aromatic protons**: Two signals indicate that the di-substitution pattern on the benzene ring creates two distinct environments for the aromatic protons. This could correspond to ortho, meta, or para substitution.

2. **Vinyl protons**: Two signals—one doublet and one doublet of quartets—suggest the presence of a vinyl group with two different types of protons. The splitting patterns indicate coupling between the protons on the double bond and adjacent groups.

3. **Methyl groups**: Two signals for methyl groups indicate the presence of two distinct methyl environments.

4. **No CH2 signals**: This implies that the substituents do not contain any CH2 groups.

The molecular formula is determined by analyzing the substituents on the benzene ring. One substituent is an ester group (-O-CO-OCH3), which contributes 3 carbons and 3 hydrogens. The second substituent must account for the remaining carbons and hydrogens. Based on the NMR data, the second substituent is likely a vinyl group with a methyl group, such as CH2=CHCH3. This substituent contributes 3 carbons and 7 hydrogens.

### Molecular Formula Calculation:
- **Benzene ring**: 6 carbons, 6 hydrogens.
- **Ester group (-O-CO-OCH3)**: 3 carbons, 3 hydrogens.
- **Vinyl group (CH2=CHCH3)**: 3 carbons, 7 hydrogens.

Adding these together:
- **Total carbons**: 6 (benzene) + 3 (ester) + 3 (vinyl) = 12 carbons.
- **Total hydrogens**: 6 (benzene) - 2 (replaced by substituents) + 3 (ester) + 7 (vinyl) = 14 hydrogens.
- **Oxygen**: 2 oxygens from the ester group.

Thus, the molecular formula is **C12H14O2**, which corresponds to option **B**.

### Conclusion:
The compound is identified as **C12H14O2** based on the spectroscopic data and molecular formula analysis.
