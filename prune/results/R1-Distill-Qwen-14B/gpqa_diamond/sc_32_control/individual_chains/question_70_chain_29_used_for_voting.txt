Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about figuring out the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A to D with different symmetry groups. I remember that symmetry groups are related to the shapes of molecules, like whether they're symmetrical in certain ways.

Let me read the problem again. So, solid A reacts with gas B (8 equivalents) to form bright red product C. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Then, when C reacts with water, it reforms A plus two acids F and G. F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

Hmm, okay. Let's try to identify what each substance could be. The reactions involve various steps and products.

First reaction: A + 8 B → C. So, 8 equivalents of B per A. That makes me think of something like sulfur reacting with something else. Wait, sulfur trioxide maybe? Wait, no, let me think. Alternatively, maybe a reaction like the formation of a sulfite or sulfate? Or perhaps a nitride? Wait, I'm not so sure.

Wait, bright red product C. That's a clue. What's a bright red solid? Maybe something like silver chloride is white, but wait. Oh, wait, maybe it's a transition metal compound. Iron(III) oxide is reddish, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe a sulfur compound. When sulfur is burned, it forms SO2, which is a gas. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the second reaction is C reacting with D to produce E. That's 2 equivalents of D. Hmm. Let's think about possible D and E. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, if D and B make H, a solvent, perhaps D is H2O or something else. Wait, wait, D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio. Like, HCl and NaOH reacting in 1:1 would give NaCl and water. But H is a solvent, so maybe D is H2O? No, because B is a gas. Or maybe D is another gas that, when reacting with B (a gas), forms a solvent.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the third reaction: C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Strong and weak acids from the same reaction. Hmm, what if C is a sulfide? Like, maybe C is FeS or something else. But then when it reacts with water, maybe it produces H2S (though that's a weak acid) and another acid.

Wait, another thought. If C is a sulfite or sulfate salt. Let's say C is a sulfite salt, like Na2SO3. Then when reacting with water, perhaps it's decomposing. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the first reaction again. 8 equivalents of gas B reacting with A to form C. 8 equivalents is a lot. Maybe B is O2? Or maybe SO3, but that's a gas under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe B is H2S? No, I'm not quite getting this.

Wait, let me think about the possible products. When C reacts with D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Maybe E is a gas, like HCl or something else? Or a dangerous compound like phosgene or something.

Wait, another angle. The reaction of C with water gives A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak. So the decomposition of C in water yields a strong acid and a weak acid. What if C is a sulfite? Let's consider that. For example, Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it might hydrolyze. Wait, but sulfites are usually not that stable. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitride. For instance, if A is NaNO3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's try to think about what produces a bright red solid. I think of mercury(II) oxide, HgO, but that's red. But I don't know if that fits with the other reactions.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a transition metal sulfide. Like FeS is black, but perhaps another sulfide. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nitrate. Wait, not sure.

Wait, considering the reaction with D. Suppose D is H2O, but then H would be a product when D (H2O) reacts with B. So if B is a gas like NH3, and D is H2O, then H could be NH3 + H2O → NH4OH (which is a weak acid, but maybe it's H2O and B is something else). Alternatively, perhaps B is SO2 and D is O2, but not sure.

Wait, maybe if D is Cl2, a gas. Then H could be something like HCl when B is H2O, but no, because B is a gas. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Wait, maybe B is O2? Then D could be something else. Let me think again about the first reaction: A + 8 B → C. If B is O2, perhaps A is something like Fe, and C is FeO? But FeO is not that bright red.

Wait, perhaps A is S, and B is O2. So sulfur (solid) reacting with 8 equivalents of O2 to form SO4^2-? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is Cu, and B is O2, forming CuO, which is black, not red.

Hmm, another idea. Maybe C is a sulfide. Let's say A is Fe, and B is S. Then Fe + S → FeS, which is black. But the product is bright red, so maybe another metal. Wait, what about PbS? Lead(II) sulfide is a dark color, I think. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride. Like sodium nitride, Na3N. But not sure about color.

Wait, perhaps C is a peroxide. For example, if A is Na and B is O2, 8 moles of O2 would form something like NaO2? Not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the first reaction is the formation of a sulfite. For example, if B is SO2 gas, and A is a metal, perhaps Na. So Na + 8 SO2 → Na2SO3? No, that doesn't make sense in terms of stoichiometry.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is the formation of a sulfate. For example, if A is Fe and B is SO3, then Fe + 8 SO3 → Fe(SO3)4? Not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the third reaction again: C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is strong acid, G is weak. So perhaps C is a salt that decomposes into a strong acid and a weak acid when water is added. For example, maybe C is sodium sulfite (Na2SO3). When it reacts with water, it might hydrolyze into H2SO3 (which is a weak acid, sulfurous acid) and maybe another acid. Wait, but where would the strong acid come from?

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible acids. F is a strong acid, like HCl or H2SO4. G is a weak acid, like CH3COOH or H3PO4. Wait, but from what decomposition?

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed salt. For example, if C is ammonium sulfide ((NH4)2S), when it reacts with water, it might produce NH4OH (a weak acid, but I'm not sure) and H2S (a weak acid). Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For instance, sodium nitride (Na3N). When it reacts with water, it produces NH3 (a weak base) and NaOH (a strong base). But that doesn't fit because we get acids, not bases. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide like FeS. When FeS reacts with water, it might produce H2S (a weak acid) and Fe(OH)2 (a base). But again, that's a base, not an acid. Hmm.

Wait, this is getting frustrating. Maybe I'm approaching it wrong. Let's instead think about the possible products and their structures.

The question is about the symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Symmetry groups are related to the molecule's shape. For example:

- C2: a molecule with a two-fold rotation axis. Like water (H2O), which has a C2 symmetry.

- D4h: a molecule with a four-fold rotation axis and horizontal mirror planes. For example, ozone (O3) has a D3h symmetry, but I'm not sure about D4h.

Wait, D∞h is the symmetry of a linear molecule with an infinite number of symmetry operations, like carbon dioxide (CO2) is D∞h.

C2v has a two-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes. For example, H2O has C2v symmetry.

Wait, so E is a product of C reacting with D. What kind of molecule would that be?

If E is a linear molecule, like CO2, then it would have D∞h symmetry. If E is something like H2O, which is bent, it would have C2v symmetry.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule with a center of inversion and a C2 axis, it might be C2.

Wait, but what kind of reaction produces E?

In the second reaction, C reacts with D (gas) in a 2:1 ratio to form E. So, C + 2 D → E.

If C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3, and D is H2O, perhaps E is H2SO3 (sulfurous acid). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if D is O2, perhaps E is something else.

Wait, but E is extremely hazardous. So, perhaps E is something like phosgene (COCl2), which is a toxic gas. Or maybe something like chlorine gas, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another dangerous compound could be hydrogen cyanide (HCN), but that's a linear molecule. HCN has a triple bond and linear structure, so its symmetry group would be D∞h. Wait, but HCN is a linear molecule with a C∞v point group, but in molecular symmetry terms, it's D∞h because it has a center of inversion and mirror planes.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely certain about E. Let's think about the other clues. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, D and B combine in 1:1 to make H, a solvent.

If B is a gas like H2 and D is Cl2, then H could be HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm. Alternatively, if B is CO2 and D is H2O, then H would be carbonic acid, but that's a weak acid and not a solvent. Wait, but H is a solvent, so maybe something like ethanol (but that's made from other reactions). Alternatively, H could be something like CH3OH (methanol), which is a solvent.

Wait, D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio. So, maybe B is CH3OH and D is something else. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Another angle: if D is O2, and B is H2, then H would be H2O, a solvent. Oh, that makes sense. So, B is H2 (a gas), D is O2 (a gas), and when they react in a 1:1 ratio, they form H2O (H is a solvent).

Wait, but in that case, the first reaction is A + 8 H2 → C. What could that be? If A is a metal, perhaps. Let's think, for example, if A is Fe, then reacting with H2 in large amounts might form FeH2? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where A is a metal oxide. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, but in the first reaction, A reacts with 8 equivalents of B (H2) to form C. If B is H2, and 8 moles are involved, perhaps it's a reaction like the formation of a hydride. For example, sodium (Na) reacting with H2 to form NaH. But the stoichiometry would be 2 Na + H2 → 2 NaH. So, 1 equivalent of H2 per 2 Na. Not 8 per 1.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me try another approach. Let's think about the decomposition of C in water. It produces A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, if C is a sulfide, maybe it decomposes into a metal hydroxide and H2S. But that would produce a base and a weak acid, which doesn't fit because F is a strong acid.

Wait, maybe C is a nitride. For example, Ca3N2. When Ca3N2 reacts with water, it produces NH3 and Ca(OH)2. But again, that's a base, not an acid.

Wait, another idea: if C is a metal carbonate. For example, Na2CO3. Reacting with water would not produce much, but perhaps in an acidic solution? Wait, but when Na2CO3 reacts with water, it hydrolyzes into NaOH and CO2. CO2 is a weak acid, but NaOH is a strong base. Hmm, not matching F and G.

Alternatively, if C is a metal sulfate. Na2SO4. Reacting with water... not much, unless it's in a solution. Not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate? Or maybe something else.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak base. Wait, when it decomposes in water, perhaps it releases a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait, maybe C is a mixed salt, like a sulfite and something else. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: the product E is formed when C reacts with D in 2 equivalents. If E is a gas, perhaps it's something like HCl, but that's a strong acid. Alternatively, maybe it's a gas like SO2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, considering all the reactions, perhaps A is sulfur (S), B is O2, and C is SO3? But SO3 is a liquid under certain conditions. Let's see: S (solid) + O2 (gas) → SO3. But the reaction equation would be 2S + 3O2 → 2SO3. So, that's 3/2 equivalents of O2 per S. Not matching the 8 equivalents mentioned.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of the possible E and its symmetry group.

If E is a molecule with D∞h symmetry, like CO2, which is linear. If E is a linear molecule, then the answer might be D) D∞h.

But let me think about E's possible structure. If E is phosgene (COCl2), which is a planar molecule with Cl-C-Cl as the central structure, that's a trigonal planar geometry. Its point group is D∞h.

Another possibility: if E is H2O, which is bent, its point group is C2v.

Wait, but the problem states that E is extremely hazardous. Phosgene is quite toxic, as is HCN. Alternatively, chlorine gas is dangerous, but its structure is diatomic, so D∞h symmetry.

Wait, chlorine (Cl2) is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. So if E is Cl2, then the symmetry group is D∞h.

But how does that fit with the reactions? Let's see.

If C reacts with D (maybe Cl2) to form Cl2 as E, that might not make sense. Because if C is a chloride, reacting with Cl2 would produce more Cl-.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me try to summarize:

- Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red solid)
- Reaction 2: C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous)
- Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
- Reaction 4: D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent)

So, from reaction 4: D + B → H, which is a solvent. So H is likely a liquid. If H is H2O, then D and B would react to form H2O. For example, if B is H2 and D is O2, then H would be H2O (solvent). So, in reaction 4, B is H2 (gas), D is O2 (gas), and H is H2O (solvent).

In reaction 1: A + 8 H2 → C. What's a reaction where a solid reacts with a large amount of H2 to form a red solid? Maybe the formation of a metal hydride. Alternatively, perhaps A is Fe, and C is FeH2? Not sure, but I'm stuck here.

In reaction 2: C + 2 O2 → E. So, C reacts with O2 to form E, which is dangerous. If E is a gas, maybe SO2 or something else. But SO2 isn't extremely hazardous in small amounts, but it's toxic. Alternatively, E could be HCl gas, but that wouldn't fit with O2.

Wait, another dangerous gas is CO (carbon monoxide), but its reaction with O2 would require heat, and it's not clear how that fits.

Alternatively, perhaps E is NO2, which is a reddish-brown gas and highly toxic. How would C react with O2 to produce NO2?

Wait, if C is a nitrate salt, like NaNO3. Then C reacting with O2 (but O2 is already in the nitrate, so not sure). Alternatively, if C is a nitride, like NaNO3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide, and D is O2. So, C (sulfide) + O2 → SO2 or something else.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide, like FeS. Then FeS + O2 → FeO and SO2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe E is NO (nitric oxide), which is a dangerous gas. NO has a linear structure (N≡O), so its symmetry group would be D∞h.

So, if E is NO, then its symmetry group is D∞h.

But let's think again about reaction 2: C reacts with 2 D → E. If D is O2, then reaction is C + 2 O2 → E.

If E is NO, that would require C to be a nitrogen compound. For example, if C is NH3, but NH3 is a gas, not a solid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. Let's say C is a nitride like Na3N. Then, reacting with O2 might produce NO and other products. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps C is sodium oxide (Na2O). Reacting with O2? Not sure.

This is getting really complicated. Let me try to think about the options for E and their symmetry groups again.

Option C is D∞h. Symmetry group of CO2 is D∞h. Maybe E is CO2? But that's not extremely hazardous in small amounts. Alternatively, E could be O3 (ozone), which has a bent structure, D3h symmetry.

Wait, O3 is a toxic gas, but it's not linear. Its symmetry group is D3h, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, E could be H2O, which has C2v symmetry (option D). But H2O isn't extremely hazardous unless in large amounts or specific contexts.

Alternatively, if E is something like HCl gas, which is diatomic, so D∞h symmetry. But HCl is a strong acid, not extremely hazardous in small amounts.

Wait, another thought: if E is SO2, which is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry. SO2 has a structure similar to O3, with a central sulfur atom and two oxygen atoms. So its point group is D3h, but I'm not sure if that's one of the options.

Wait, looking back, the options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

So D∞h is option C. CO2 is D∞h, as is HCN and Cl2.

If E is Cl2 (chlorine gas), which is diatomic and has D∞h symmetry. Then, the answer would be C) D∞h.

But how does that fit with the reactions?

Looking back:

Reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). If H is H2O (solvent), then B and D must react to form H2O. So, if B is H2 and D is O2, then H is H2O.

In reaction 1: A + 8 H2 → C. So, A is a metal that reacts with H2 to form a hydride. For example, Na reacts with H2 to form NaH. But the stoichiometry would be 2 Na + H2 → 2 NaH. So, per mole of H2, 2 moles of Na are used. So, 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of H2 per 1 mole of A (if A is Na, but I'm not sure about the exact reaction).

Reaction 2: C + 2 O2 → E. So, if C is NaH, then NaH + O2 → NaOH + H2O? But that doesn't produce a dangerous gas. Alternatively, if C is something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm way off here. Let's try to think about the overall picture again.

The key is reaction 3: C reacts with water to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, C must decompose into A and two acids. So, perhaps C is a salt that contains the conjugate base of a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), when it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes:

Na2SO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + H2SO3.

Wait, but NaOH is a strong base, not an acid. Hmm, that's not matching.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate, like NaNO3. Reacting with water doesn't typically produce strong acids, but perhaps in acidic conditions...

Wait, perhaps C is ammonium sulfide ((NH4)2S). When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes into NH3 (a weak base) and H2S (a weak acid). But F and G are acids. So, this isn't matching.

Wait, another idea: what if C is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Then, in water:

Na2CO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + CO2.

CO2 is a weak acid, but NaOH is a strong base. So, again, not matching F and G being acids.

Hmm, perhaps C is a sulfate, like FeSO4. When it reacts with water, it might form Fe(OH)SO4, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate, like benzene sulfonate. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal chloride. For example, if C is MgCl2, then reacting with water doesn't produce acids, but perhaps in some cases, hydrolysis could produce HCl (a strong acid) and another acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: since F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps C is a salt that contains both strong and weak acid anions. For example, if C is sodium hydrogen sulfate (NaHSO4), which in water would dissociate into Na+, HSO4^- (which can further dissociate into H+ and SO4^2-). But HSO4^- is a weak acid. Alternatively, if C is a salt like Na2HPO4, which in water can hydrolyze to produce H2PO4^- (a weak acid) and NaOH (a strong base). Not matching.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide of a metal with a +2 oxidation state, like ZnS. Reacting with water might not produce acids, though.

This is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should try to think about the symmetry group of E again.

If E has D∞h symmetry, it's likely a linear molecule like O=C=S (carbonyl sulfide), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe E is a diatomic molecule like Cl2, which has D∞h symmetry.

Alternatively, E could be a molecule like CO (carbon monoxide), which is linear and has D∞h symmetry. CO is a toxic gas, which fits the description.

If E is CO, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → CO. But what is D in that case?

Wait, earlier we thought D is O2. So, C + 2 O2 → CO. That would require C to be a carbon-containing compound. Hmm.

Alternatively, if D is H2, but then reaction 2 would be C + 2 H2 → E, which might be methane or something else. Not sure.

Wait, thinking about the first reaction again. If A is carbon (solid), and B is O2, then C could be CO or CO2. But with 8 equivalents of O2, perhaps it's forming CO2.

Wait, the formation of CO2 would have the reaction: C (solid) + O2 (gas) → CO2 (gas). The stoichiometry would be 1 C + 1 O2 → 1 CO2, so that's 1 equivalent. But the problem says 8 equivalents of B, so maybe it's 8 O2 per C. Not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is something else entirely. I'm getting stuck on this.

Wait, perhaps C is Fe3O4. Reacting with O2 would produce FeO or something else. Not sure.

Another idea: perhaps C is a nitro compound, which upon reaction with O2 could form NO or NO2. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps E is O3 (ozone), which has a bent structure and a D3h symmetry. But D3h isn't one of the options. So, probably not.

Wait, considering all this, perhaps the answer is C) D∞h, as E is a linear molecule like CO or Cl2. Since Cl2 is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry and is a toxic gas, that might fit.

So, putting it all together, the symmetry group of E is D∞h. Therefore, the answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The stoichiometry and the bright red color suggest that C could be a compound like a sulfide, nitride, or oxide. However, the exact identity of A and B remains unclear.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, described as extremely hazardous. This suggests E is likely a toxic gas. Possible candidates include CO (carbon monoxide), SO2 (sulfur dioxide), or Cl2 (chlorine gas). These gases are linear or have specific symmetry groups.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This indicates that C likely decomposes into a strong acid and a weak acid, consistent with certain salts or compounds like sulfites or sulfates.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If H is water (H2O), then B and D could be H2 and O2, respectively.

5. **Symmetry Group Analysis**:
   - **C2**: A two-fold rotation axis, typical for bent molecules like H2O.
   - **D4h**: A four-fold rotation axis with horizontal mirror planes, seen in molecules like ozone (O3).
   - **D∞h**: A linear molecule with an infinite number of symmetry operations, such as CO (linear) or Cl2 (diatomic).
   - **C2v**: A two-fold rotation axis with vertical mirror planes, seen in bent molecules like SO2.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - E is described as extremely hazardous and likely a gas. Cl2 (chlorine gas) is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry, fitting the description of E. CO (carbon monoxide) is another possibility, also with D∞h symmetry. Both are linear molecules, consistent with the D∞h symmetry group.

Given the evidence, the molecular symmetry group of E is **D∞h**.

Answer: C
