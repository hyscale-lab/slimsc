Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. It's about a star with certain characteristics and how dark spots on its surface affect the temperature and the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels. 

Alright, let me start breaking it down. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots, its effective temperature is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature drops to 5500 K. I remember that when a star has spots, those spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so they make the overall temperature of the star appear lower.

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the photosphere. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. I'm supposed to find by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Wait, okay, the ratio is n1/n2 when there are no spots and when there are spots. The problem says the ratio decreases when there are spots. So the ratio without spots is higher than with spots.

I think this has to do with the Saha equation. Because the Saha equation deals with the ionization states of atoms in a stellar atmosphere, but wait, here we're dealing with different energy levels of the same ion. Oh, right, the Boltzmann equation is probably what I need here because it deals with the population of different energy levels within the same ion.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 is the energy of the higher level, E1 the lower, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

So the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

But wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T decreases (from 6000 to 5500 K), the ratio n1/n2 becomes smaller. Let's see why.

Looking at the equation, (E2 - E1) is positive because E2 is higher. So as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, because (E2-E1)/(k T) increases (since T is smaller, same numerator). So exp(-x) with larger x is smaller, meaning the entire ratio n1/n2 would decrease when T decreases. Which matches the problem statement.

So the ratio without spots is higher than with spots. The factor by which it changes is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Let me compute that. Let's denote R = (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So the factor is R_no_spots / R_with_spots = [exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T1) )] / [exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T2) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp[ (E2 - E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) ]

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

Wait, R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So when T changes from T1 (6000 K) to T2 (5500 K), the ratio R changes.

The factor is R1 / R2, where R1 is for T1, R2 for T2.

So R1/R2 = [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ] 

The (g1/g2) cancels out, so we get exp[ (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) ]

But wait, 1/T1 is larger than 1/T2 because T1 is smaller than T2? Wait no, T1 is 6000, T2 is 5500. So 1/T1 is about 0.000166667 per K, 1/T2 is about 0.000181818 per K. So 1/T1 < 1/T2. So (1/T1 - 1/T2) is negative. So the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * (negative number). So the exponent is negative. So exp(negative) is a small number. But wait, R1 is for T1, which is higher than T2. So when the temperature decreases, R decreases. So R1 is for no spots (higher T, higher R), R2 with spots (lower R). So the factor R1/R2 is greater than 1.

But let me compute the exponent.

First, I need to find (E2-E1)/(k). Well, I don't have the exact energy difference, but I know the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. So that's 1448 angstroms, which is 1448e-10 meters.

The energy of a photon is E = hc / λ.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, ~3e8 m/s.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) 

Let me compute that. 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.372e-18 J.

But wait, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So E in eV is 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.56 eV.

So E2 - E1 ≈ 8.56 eV.

But wait, I should be careful with the units. Let me compute it again.

Calculate E = hc / λ:

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s
c = 299792458 m/s
λ = 1448e-10 m

E = (6.62607015e-34 * 299792458) / (1448e-10)

Let me compute numerator first: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 ≈ 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1448e-10 m => 1.448e-7 m.

E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.372e-18 J.

Convert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J.

So E = 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.56 eV.

So E2-E1 = 8.56 eV.

But wait, we're working in terms of k*T, so let's compute E/(k) in terms of temperature.

k = Boltzmann constant = 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So (E2 - E1) / (k) = (8.56 eV) / (1.38e-23 J/K * 1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) )

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute E in J, then divide by k.

E = 8.56 eV = 8.56 * 1.602e-19 J ≈ 1.371e-18 J.

So (E2-E1)/(k) = (1.371e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ 1.371e-18 / 1.38e-23 ≈ 9.94e4 ≈ 99400 K.

Wait, that's a big number. So (E2-E1)/(k) ≈ 99400 K.

So now, compute the exponent: (E2 - E1)/(k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2).

T1 = 6000 K, T2 =5500 K.

1/T1 = 1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667 K^-1

1/T2 = 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818 K^-1

So (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (0.000166667 - 0.000181818) = -0.000015151 K^-1.

Multiply by (E2-E1)/(k) → 99400 K * (-0.000015151 K^-1) = 

Hmmm, 99400 * (-0.000015151) = approximately -1.506.

So the exponent is -1.506.

So the factor is exp(-1.506) ≈ approximately 0.221.

Wait, but wait. The factor is R1 / R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) )

Which is exp( (99400 K) * (-0.000015151 1/K) )

Which is exp(-1.506) ≈ 0.221.

Wait, but that would imply that R1 is 0.221 times R2? But earlier I thought R1 is larger. Wait no, no. R1 is the ratio when T is higher (6000 K), R2 when T is lower (5500 K). So if R1 is higher than R2, then R1/R2 is greater than 1. But according to this calculation, it's 0.221, which is less than 1. That seems contradictory. Did I make a mistake in the sign somewhere?

Wait, let me check. The ratio R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So when T increases, (E2 - E1)/(k T) decreases (since T is higher, denominator is larger), so the exponent becomes smaller (less positive). So exp(small) is smaller than exp(large). Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, when E2 > E1, (E2-E1)/(k T) is positive. So when T is larger, the exponent is smaller because T is in the denominator. So exp(small positive) is smaller than exp(large positive). So when T increases, the exponent becomes smaller, so the ratio R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(small) would be smaller. Wait, no, because for higher T, (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller, so the exponent is smaller. For example, if T doubles, the exponent halves.

So, in R = n1/n2, when T increases, the term (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller, so the exp is smaller, so R would be smaller. So when T increases, R decreases. So when the star has no spots (T1=6000 K), R is higher than when it has spots (T2=5500 K). So R1 (no spots) is higher than R2 (spots). So R1/R2 is greater than 1.

But according to my calculation, the exponent is negative, so exp(-1.506) is about 0.22, which would mean R1/R2 is 0.22, which is less than 1. That contradicts what I just thought. So I must have messed up the sign in the exponent.

Let me re-examine the setup. The ratio R is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So at higher T, (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller. So the exponent is smaller, so exp() is smaller.

But wait, for a higher T, when (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller, the exponent is smaller, so n1/n2 is lower because the exponential term is smaller.

Wait, when T is higher, R would be smaller. So the ratio without spots (higher T) is smaller than with spots (lower T). But the problem states that the ratio decreases when there are spots. Which would mean that when there are spots (lower T), the ratio is smaller. So R1 (no spots) is higher than R2 (spots). So R1/R2 is greater than 1.

But according to my calculation, R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) = exp( 99400 * (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Wait, wait no: 1/T1 is 1/6000, 1/T2 is 1/5500. So 1/T1 - 1/T2 is negative. So (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) is negative. So exp(negative) is less than 1. So R1/R2 is less than 1, which would imply R1 < R2. But the problem says R decreases when spots are present, which would mean R1 > R2. So contradiction.

Hmm. Where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I have the ratio backwards. Let me check: the problem says the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energy levels. The ratio is n1/n2. When spots are present, the ratio decreases. So n1/n2 is smaller with spots. So without spots, n1/n2 is higher.

Wait, let me think about the Boltzmann equation again. n1 and n2 are the populations of levels 1 and 2. Let me denote level 1 as the lower energy level, level 2 as higher.

So the equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Which can be rewritten as n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So when T is higher, (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller, so n1/n2 is smaller. Wait, no.

Wait, let me think: For higher T, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller because T is in the denominator. So exp(small) is smaller, so n1/n2 is smaller. So higher T leads to smaller n1/n2. Lower T would have larger exponent, so larger n1/n2.

Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought before. So when T is higher (no spots), n1/n2 is smaller. When T is lower (spots), n1/n2 is larger. But the problem says when there are spots, the ratio decreases. So that would mean that when spots are present, n1/n2 is lower than when there are no spots. Which would be the opposite of what I just thought. So perhaps I have the ratio backwards.

Wait, let me read the problem again. "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

So when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases.

So without spots, ratio is higher. So n1/n2 is higher without spots.

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, when T increases, n1/n2 decreases. So without spots, T is higher, leading to lower n1/n2. But the problem says that the ratio is higher without spots. So something is wrong here. Maybe I have the levels mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps level 1 is the higher energy level and level 2 is the lower. Then, the equation would be different.

Wait, perhaps the definition is n1/n2, but perhaps I'm assuming level 1 is lower. If actually, level 2 is lower, then the equation would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is n2/n1. Let me re-express the Boltzmann equation.

The general form is: n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

So if level 1 is lower than level 2, then E1 < E2. So (E_i - E_j) would be (E2 - E1) if i is level 2, j is level 1.

So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Which can be rewritten as n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So when T increases, (E2 - E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent is smaller. So exp(small) is smaller, so n1/n2 is smaller.

Wait, that brings us back to the same conclusion.

So according to the equation, when T increases, n1/n2 decreases. So when the star has spots, T decreases, so n1/n2 increases. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So this contradicts.

Hmm. So perhaps I have the ratio inverted? Let me think: perhaps the ratio is n2/n1, not n1/n2.

If the ratio is n2/n1, then when T increases, n2/n1 increases because the exponent -(E2-E1)/(k T) is a larger negative number, making exp more smaller, so n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, if E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive. So -(E2-E1)/(k T) is negative. So exp(-something) is less than 1. So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative (because denominator is larger), so the exp becomes larger (closer to 1), which means n2/n1 increases.

So if the ratio is n2/n1, then higher T would mean higher ratio. So when the star has no spots (higher T), ratio is higher. When it has spots (lower T), ratio is lower. Which matches the problem statement.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So if the ratio (n2/n1) increases, that would mean (n1/n2) decreases. So perhaps the ratio we're considering is n2/n1. Or perhaps I have the levels inverted.

Wait, the problem says the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in levels 1 and 2. So that's n1/n2.

But according to the equation, when T increases, n1/n2 decreases. So without spots, higher T, so n1/n2 is lower. But the problem says that when spots are present, the ratio decreases. So that would imply that without spots, the ratio is higher. Which is the opposite of what the equation suggests.

I must have made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition is from level 2 to level 1, meaning that the wavelength corresponds to the energy difference between level 2 and level 1.

Wait, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. So if the light is emitted when an atom drops from level 2 to level 1, then E2 > E1. So the same conclusion as before.

Another approach: perhaps the calculation is correct but I reversed the ratio.

If the ratio R is n2/n1, then R = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So when T is higher, R is higher because the exponent is less negative. So when the star has no spots (T=6000), R is higher. When it has spots (T=5500), R is lower. So R1/R2 = R_no_spots / R_with_spots = [ (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]

So R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, let's compute that.

E2-E1 is 8.56 eV, as before, which is 1.371e-18 J.

(E2-E1)/(k) = (1.371e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = ~99400 K.

So (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) = 99400 * (1/6000 - 1/5500)

Compute 1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667, 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818.

Difference: 0.000166667 - 0.000181818 = -0.000015151.

Multiply by 99400:

99400 * (-0.000015151) ≈ -1.506.

So R1/R2 = exp(-1.506) ≈ 0.221.

Wait, but earlier I thought if the ratio is R = n2/n1, then R1 is higher, so R1/R2 would be greater than 1. But according to this, it's 0.221, which is less than 1. That suggests R1 is less than R2, which contradicts the problem statement.

I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to approach this differently. Let me compute the ratio when there are no spots and when there are spots.

Let’s compute for T1=6000 K and T2=5500 K.

Compute (n1/n2) at T1 and T2.

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Assuming g1 and g2 are the same? Or are they different?

The problem doesn't specify, but perhaps the statistical weights g1 and g2 are the same, so the ratio simplifies to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So n1/n2 ratio without spots: R1 = exp( E / (k T1) )

With spots: R2 = exp( E / (k T2) )

The factor is R1 / R2 = exp( E/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, E is E2-E1=8.56 eV.

So E/(k) is 8.56 eV / (k * eV_to_J conversion) ?

Wait, no, earlier I computed E = 8.56 eV, which is 1.371e-18 J.

So E/(k) = 1.371e-18 J / 1.38e-23 J/K = ~99400 K.

So 1/T1 is 1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667 K^-1.

1/T2 is 0.000181818 K^-1.

So 1/T1 - 1/T2 = -0.000015151 K^-1.

Multiply by (E/(k)) → 99400 * (-0.000015151) ≈ -1.506.

So exp(-1.506) ≈ 0.221.

So R1/R2 = 0.221, which is ~0.22.

But wait, the problem states that the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So R2 < R1. So R1/R2 is greater than 1.

But according to this, R1/R2 is 0.22, which is less than 1. So something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I inverted the ratio. Let's compute R2/R1. Then R2/R1 = exp( E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ). Which would be exp( 99400 * (0.000181818 - 0.000166667 )) → 99400 * 0.000015151 = +1.506.

So exp(1.506) ≈ 4.5.

So R2/R1 is 4.5. So R1/R2 is 1/4.5 ≈ 0.222. So the same as before.

But according to the problem statement, when the star has spots, n1/n2 decreases. So R2 < R1. So R1/R2 is greater than 1. But according to this, R1/R2 is 0.22, which is less than 1. So that's a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I've mixed up the levels. Suppose level 1 is higher in energy than level 2. Then E1 > E2, so E2 - E1 is negative. Then, the exponent in n1/n2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) would be negative. So when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) is more negative, so the exponent is lower, making n1/n2 smaller.

But in that case, if level 1 is higher, then when the star has spots (lower T), n1/n2 would be larger because T is lower, the exponent is less negative. So without spots (higher T), n1/n2 is smaller, which would mean when spots are present, n1/n2 is higher, but the problem states the opposite.

This suggests that perhaps the ratio is n2/n1. Let me try that.

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Assuming g2/g1 is constant, then n2/n1 = exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So for higher T, -(E2-E1)/(k T) is less negative, so exponent is larger, so n2/n1 is larger.

So when the star has no spots, T is higher, so n2/n1 is higher. When the star has spots, T is lower, so n2/n1 is lower. So the ratio n2/n1 decreases when the star has spots. Which matches the problem statement.

So the problem says that the ratio n1/n2 decreases when spots are present. If the ratio n2/n1 increases, then n1/n2 must decrease. So perhaps the problem refers to the ratio n2/n1 as the one that increases, but the question states it's n1/n2 that decreases.

Wait, the question says the ratio of n1/n2 decreases. So perhaps I have an error in the way I set up the ratio in the Boltzmann equation.

Alternative approach: perhaps the energy levels are inverted. Let me assume that E1 is higher than E2.

In that case, E2 - E1 = -8.56 eV.

So the Boltzmann ratio becomes n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Which is exp( -8.56 eV / (k T) )

Wait, so when T increases, the exponent becomes more negative, so n1/n2 is smaller. So when the star doesn't have spots (T=6000 K), n1/n2 is smaller, which would mean that when spots are present (T=5500 K), n1/n2 is larger. But the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present, so this would imply that without spots, the ratio is higher. Which is the opposite of what the equation suggests.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about it in terms of the change in T and how it affects the exponent.

The problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric T decreases to 5500 K. The ratio n1/n2 decreases when spots are present. So when T is lower, the ratio is smaller.

But with the Boltzmann equation as I set it up, lower T would lead to higher n1/n2 if E2 > E1. So this doesn't match. 

Alternative approach: perhaps the energy levels are in the other way. Let me think of level 2 as the lower energy level, so E2 < E1. Then, the energy difference would be negative, E2-E1 = -8.56 eV.

So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) exp( -8.56 eV/(k T) )

So for higher T, the exponent is less negative (since T is larger), so exp is larger. So n1/n2 is larger when T is higher.

Which would mean that when the star has no spots (T=6000 K), n1/n2 is larger. When it has spots (T=5500 K), n1/n2 is smaller. Which matches the problem statement. 

Ah! So that must be the case. So level 1 is higher than level 2. So E1 > E2. So E2 - E1 = -8.56 eV.

So now, when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) is a more negative number, so the exponent is more negative, so exp is smaller, so n1/n2 is smaller. Wait, no. Let me recompute.

Wait, E2-E1 = -8.56 eV. So (E2-E1)/(k T) = (-8.56eV) / (k T). 

So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) exp( -8.56eV/(k T) )

So for higher T, the exponent is less negative, so the exp is larger. So n1/n2 is larger.

So in this scenario, when the star has no spots (higher T), n1/n2 is higher. When the star has spots (lower T), n1/n2 is lower. Which matches the problem statement.

So this must be the correct setup. So the energy levels are such that level 1 is higher than level 2, so E2 < E1. Therefore, E2 - E1 is negative.

So now, let's recalculate the factor.

R1 = n1/n2 without spots = exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) = exp( (-8.56eV)/(k * 6000 K) )

R2 = n1/n2 with spots = exp( (-8.56eV)/(k *5500 K) )

So the factor is R1/R2 = exp[ (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Which is exp[ (-8.56eV/k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) ]

Compute (-8.56eV/k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) → Let me compute this.

First, (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = -5e2 / 3.3e7 → ≈ -0.000015151 K^-1.

But since E2-E1 is negative, the product would be:

(-8.56eV/k) * (-0.000015151) → positive.

Wait, E = E2-E1 = -8.56eV, so (E2-E1) is -8.56eV. So (E2-E1)/k = (-8.56eV)/(k) → which in terms of K is (8.56eV)/(k * eV_to_J conversion? Wait, no, earlier calculation found that (E2-E1)/k ≈ -99400 K.

Wait, no, in this case, E2-E1 = -8.56eV. So (E2-E1)/k is negative. So:

(E2-E1)/k = (-8.56eV) / (k) → in terms of K, that would be (E in J) / (k) → 1.371e-18 J / 1.38e-23 J/K = ~99400 K. But since E is negative (E2 < E1), (E2-E1)/k = -99400 K.

So, the exponent is (E2-E1)/k * (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (-99400 K) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) 

Which is (-99400) * ( -0.000015151 ) → 

Computing that: 99400 * 0.000015151 → 99400 * 1.5151e-5 → 

99400 * 1.5151e-5 → 99400 * 0.000015151 ≈ 1.506.

So exponent is 1.506.

So R1/R2 = exp(1.506) ≈ 4.5.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately 4.5.

Looking back at the options, option C is ~4.5.

So the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights of the two energy levels, \(E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The problem specifies that the ratio \(n_1/n_2\) decreases when the star has spots, indicating that the ratio is higher at \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (no spots) than at \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (spots).

### Key Steps:
1. **Energy Difference from Wavelength**: The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \(1448 \, \text{Å}\). Using the relation \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), the energy difference is calculated as:
   \[
   E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)), we find:
   \[
   E \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. **Boltzmann Factor**: The ratio of the populations depends on the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)\right),
   \]
   where \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\). Substituting \(E = 8.56 \, \text{eV}\) and \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), we compute:
   \[
   \frac{E}{k} = \frac{8.56 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99400 \, \text{K}.
   \]

3. **Temperature Difference**: Compute \(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\):
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001667, \quad \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{5500} \approx 0.0001818,
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} \approx 0.0001667 - 0.0001818 = -0.00001515 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
   \]

4. **Exponent and Factor**: Substituting into the formula:
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(99400 \times (-0.00001515)\right) = \exp(-1.506).
   \]
   Using \(\exp(-1.506) \approx 0.221\), the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately \(1 / 0.221 \approx 4.5\).

### Conclusion:
The ratio \(n_1/n_2\) decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has spots compared to when it does not. This matches option **C**.
