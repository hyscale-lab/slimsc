Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Observations show brightness variations because the star is rotating, which makes the spots come into and out of view. The question says this setup can mimic the presence of an exoplanet in terms of the light curve. Now, they're asking what the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation as these spots, assuming the star wasn't spotted.

Hmm, right. So I remember that the brightness dip caused by a planet (transit method) depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The formula is (Rp / Rstar)^2, right? Because the area is proportional to the square of the radius.

But wait, in this case, the spots are causing a variation. So the star's brightness normally is based on its total luminosity. When the spots rotate into view, the observed brightness decreases a bit because the spots are darker. I need to calculate the maximum dip in brightness caused by the spots and then figure out what planet radius would cause the same dip.

The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. But wait, the question says "only one hemisphere" is spotty. Oh, wait, no. The wording is a bit unclear. Let's read again: "One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Oh, so in that hemisphere, 20% of the surface is spots. So the total spot area is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Wait, the total area of the star is 4πR². A hemisphere's area is 2πR². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the total spot area is 0.4πR².

But wait, when the star rotates, the spots come into view. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, when the star rotates, the spots would be visible as that hemisphere comes into view. So the maximum area blocking would be the entire spot area, but perhaps the star's rotation causes the spots to be visible in phases, leading to a dip in brightness.

But perhaps the maximum dip occurs when the entire spotted area is visible. So the drop in brightness would be the difference in flux due to the spots compared to the normal star.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K.

The flux from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σT^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So the flux from the star's normal surface is σ*(6000)^4. The flux from the spots is σ*(5000)^4.

The fraction of the star covered by spots is (0.4πR²) / (4πR²) ) = 0.4 / 4 = 0.1, or 10%. So 10% of the star's surface is at a lower temperature.

Wait, no. Wait, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. The hemisphere is half the star's surface area, so 20% of 2πR² is 0.4πR². The total area of the star is 4πR², so 0.4πR² / 4πR² = 0.1, so 10% of the star's surface is spots. So when the star rotates, the maximum effect is when all the spots are visible. So the brightness dip would be the difference in flux when 10% of the star's surface is at lower temperature.

Wait, no. The star's total flux when spots are present would be (normal flux) minus the flux from the spots plus the flux from the spots at lower temperature. So the net flux is: F_total = (1 - f) * F_normal + f * F_spot, where f is the fraction of the surface covered by spots.

Wait, let me think. The star's normal flux per unit area is F_normal = σTeff^4. The spots have F_spot = σ(Teff - ΔT)^4.

So when the spots are visible (fraction f of the surface), the total flux is F = (1 - f) * F_normal + f * F_spot.

The dip in brightness compared to no spots (F_normal) is (F - F_normal) / F_normal.

So F = (1 - f) F_normal + f F_spot.

F - F_normal = (1-f) F_normal + f F_spot - F_normal = -f F_normal + f F_spot = f (F_spot - F_normal).

So the dip is (F - F_normal)/F_normal = [f (F_spot - F_normal)] / F_normal = f [ (F_spot / F_normal) - 1 ].

Substituting F_spot = F_normal * (T_spot / T_normal)^4.

T_spot = 5000 K, T_normal = 6000 K.

So F_spot / F_normal = (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

Let me compute that: 5^4 is 625, 6^4 is 1296. 625/1296 ≈ 0.48225.

So F_spot/F_normal ≈ 0.48225.

So the dip is f (0.48225 - 1) = f (-0.51775). The dip in brightness is negative, but the amplitude is the absolute value.

Wait, but since the star is losing flux, the dip is the decrease in brightness, so the fractional change is positive in terms of the amplitude. But the calculation here gives a negative dip. But for the purpose of finding the amplitude, we can ignore the sign and just take the magnitude.

So the fractional dip is f * (1 - (F_spot / F_normal)).

Wait, wait: because F_spot < F_normal, so F_spot / F_normal is less than 1. Therefore, 1 - (F_spot / F_normal) is positive. Wait, I think I messed up the sign earlier.

Let me re-arrange.

(F - F_normal) = f (F_spot - F_normal) = f (F_normal ( (T_spot / T_normal)^4 - 1 )).

So (F - F_normal)/F_normal = f [ ( (T_spot / T_normal)^4 -1 ) ].

Since T_spot is lower, (T_spot / T_normal)^4 is less than 1, so (F - F_normal) is negative, meaning F is less than F_normal. So the dip is |(F - F_normal)/F_normal| = f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_normal^4)).

So here, f is 0.1.

So dip = 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4).

Compute (5/6)^4: 625/1296 ≈ 0.48225. So 1-0.48225=0.51775. So dip is 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.051775, about 5.1775% dip.

Now, for the planet transit case, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is π Rp², and the star's area is π Rstar², so the ratio is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775.

Wait, no. Because the dip in the star's brightness due to the planet is (Rp / Rstar)^2, right? Because when the planet transits, it blocks that area, which is (Rp/Rstar)^2 of the star's light.

So if the dip from the spots is 5.1775%, then we set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276, so approximately 0.228.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options provided. The options are 0.39, 0.07, 0.11, 0.32. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I messed up the filling factor. Let me go back.

The question says the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the hemisphere's area is 2π R².

So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

The total star area is 4π R². So the fraction of the star area covered by spots is (0.4π R²) / (4π R²) ) = 0.1. So yes, f is 0.1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the dip calculation. Let me recheck.

Compute (5/6)^4: 5^4=625, 6^4=1296. 625/1296≈ 0.48225. So 1-0.48225=0.51775.

Multiply by f=0.1: 0.051775. So dip is about 5.1775%.

So for the exoplanet to produce the same dip, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.051775)≈ 0.2276.

But none of the options is around 0.23. Hmm.

Wait, let me check the options again. Oh wait, the options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

So none is 0.23. Did I make a mistake in the approach?

Wait, another approach. Perhaps the problem is not considering the entire spot area as a dip because only part of the spots are visible at any time.

Wait, no. Because the problem says the star is rotating, so the spots would come into view entirely when the star's rotation brings the hemisphere into the line of sight. So the maximum dip would be when all the spots are visible, which is when the entire 10% of the star is covered. So the dip calculation I did should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the equivalent planet radius as the square root of the dip. So 0.051775 → 0.2277 Rstar.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the dip.

Wait, perhaps the star emits more flux from the spots when they are cooler? No, that can't be. Wait, no, when the spots are cooler, the flux from them is less than the surrounding. So the total flux decreases when the spots are visible.

Wait, another angle: maybe the star emits more when the spots are on the far side, but that's not the case here. The spots are on the hemisphere facing us. Wait, no, when the star rotates, the spots come into view, so the flux is lower.

Wait, maybe I should model the situation as the difference in flux when the spots are on the near side versus the far side.

Wait, no. The star is rotating, so the spots are on the near side. So when the star is rotating, the spots are moving into and out of view.

Wait, but perhaps the maximum dip is when the entire spotted hemisphere is facing us. So the fraction of the star's surface that's spots, when the hemisphere is fully visible, is 10% (as calculated earlier).

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the maximum brightness variation when the spots are rotating in, and out. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should consider the brightness change caused by the spots. Let me think again.

The star's total flux without spots: F0 = 4π R² * σ T^4 / (4π) ) = π R² σ T^4.

Wait, no, the total flux is the surface area times the flux per unit area. So F_total = 4π R² * σ T^4.

When the spots are present, the flux is F = (4π R² - f * 2π R²) * σ T^4 + (f * 2π R²) * σ (T - ΔT)^4.

Wait, wait, because the spots are on one hemisphere. So the area covered by spots is f * 2π R². So the rest of the hemisphere (2π R² - f 2π R²) is at T, and the other hemisphere (which is 2π R²) is at T.

So F = [ (2π R² (1 - f) ) + (2π R²) ] * σ T^4 + [ f 2π R² ] * σ (T - ΔT)^4.

Wait, that would be F = [ 2π R² (1 - f) + 2π R² ] * σ T^4 + f 2π R² σ (T - ΔT)^4.

Simplify: [ 2π R² ( (1-f) +1 ) ] = 2π R² (2 -f) ) * σ T^4 + f 2π R² σ (T - ΔT)^4.

Wait, perhaps that's not the right approach. Maybe the star's surface is divided into two hemispheres. One hemisphere has spots covering 20% of that hemisphere, and the other has no spots.

So the area with spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

The rest of the star (which is 4π R² - 0.4 π R²) is at T.

So when the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F = (4π R² - 0.4 π R²) σ T^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (T - ΔT)^4.

The average flux without spots is F0 = 4 π R² σ T^4.

The dip in flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is F - F0 = [ (4π R² -0.4π R²) σ T^4 + 0.4π R² σ (T-ΔT)^4 ] - 4π R² σ T^4.

Simplify: [ (3.6 π R² σ T^4) + 0.4 π R² σ (T-ΔT)^4 ] - 4 π R² σ T^4.

= -0.4 π R² σ T^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (T-ΔT)^4.

Factor out 0.4 π R² σ:

= 0.4 π R² σ [ (T-ΔT)^4 - T^4 ].

So the fractional dip (delta F / F0) is [0.4 π R² σ ( (T-ΔT)^4 - T^4 ) ] / [4 π R² σ T^4 ].

The π R² σ terms cancel:

= (0.4 * [ (T-ΔT)^4 - T^4 ]) / (4 T^4 )

= 0.1 * [ (T/(T-ΔT))^4 -1 ].

Wait, let me compute this.

Wait, (T-ΔT)^4 - T^4 is negative because T-ΔT is less than T. So the fractional dip will be negative, but we take the absolute value for the amplitude.

So (T-ΔT) = 5000 K, T=6000 K.

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So [ (T-ΔT)^4 - T^4 ] = (5000^4 - 6000^4 ) = - (6000^4 -5000^4 ) = negative.

But when computing the fractional dip, it's (F - F0)/F0, which is negative. The amplitude is the absolute value.

So delta F / F0 = 0.1 * ( (5000/6000)^4 - 1 ) = 0.1 * (0.48225 - 1 ) = 0.1 * (-0.51775 ) = -0.051775.

So the amplitude is 0.051775, which is 5.1775%.

So the dip is about 5.18% when the spotty hemisphere is fully visible. So the planet's dip should be the same.

The planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2276, or about 0.228.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the flux.

Wait, I think I messed up in the approach. Let me think again. Let's compute the flux when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, and when it isn't.

When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

F_spotty = [ (1 - 0.2) * 2π R² * σ T^4 ] + [0.2 * 2π R² * σ (T-ΔT)^4 ].

The other hemisphere is 2π R² * σ T^4.

So F_spotty = (0.8 * 2π R² σ T^4 ) + (0.2 * 2π R² σ (T-ΔT)^4 ) + (2π R² σ T^4 ).

Wait, no, that's when the entire star is made of two hemispheres: one spotty (20% of that hemisphere) and the other normal. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F_spotty = [ (0.8 * 2π R² ) * σ T^4 ] + [0.2 * 2π R² * σ (T-ΔT)^4 ].

Which is (1.6 π R² σ T^4 ) + (0.4 π R² σ (5/6 T)^4 ).

The total without any spots is F0 = 4 π R² σ T^4.

So the dip when the spotty hemisphere is visible is F_spotty - F0 = [1.6 π R² σ T^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5/6 T)^4 ] -4 π R² σ T^4.

= (1.6 + 0.4*(5/6)^4 ) π R² σ T^4 -4 π R² σ T^4.

= [1.6 + 0.4*(625/1296)] -4 ) π R² σ T^4.

Compute 0.4*(625/1296) = 0.4 * 0.48225 ≈ 0.1929.

So 1.6 + 0.1929 = 1.7929.

1.7929 -4 = -2.2071.

So dip = (-2.2071) π R² σ T^4.

But F0 is 4 π R² σ T^4, so fractional dip is (-2.2071) π R² σ T^4 / (4 π R² σ T^4) )= -2.2071 /4 ≈ -0.5518.

Wait, that can't be right because a 55% dip is huge. That's a problem because the maximum dip would be when the entire star is covered by spots, but in this case, the spotty area is 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the approach. Let me try another way.

Alternative approach: The star has a total area A =4π R².

The spotty area is f*A = 0.1 *4π R² =0.4 π R².

The normal area is A - f*A = 3.6 π R².

The flux without spots is F0 = A * σ T^4.

With spots, the flux is F = (A - f*A) * σ T^4 + f*A * σ (T-ΔT)^4.

So F = [ (1 -f) A + f A ( (T-ΔT)/T )^4 ] * σ T^4.

So F = A σ T^4 [ (1 - f) + f ( (T-ΔT)/T )^4 ].

The fractional dip is (F - F0)/F0 = [ (1 -f) + f ( (T-ΔT)/T )^4 ] -1.

= -f + f ( (T-ΔT)/T )^4.

= f [ ( (T-ΔT)/T )^4 -1 ].

Which is the same as earlier.

So f=0.1.

(T-ΔT)/T =5000/6000=5/6.

So (5/6)^4= 625/1296≈0.48225.

So the fractional dip is 0.1*(0.48225 -1 )= 0.1*(-0.51775)= -0.051775.

So the dip is about 5.1775% in brightness.

So the planet's dip should be (Rp/Rstar)^2=0.051775 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈0.2276.

Hmm, but that's about 0.228, which isn't any of the options. The options are 0.39, 0.07, 0.11, 0.32.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering that the spots are only on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, only a portion of the spots are visible at any given time. But wait, the problem says that the situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So when the star is not spotted, the exoplanet would cause the same dip as the spots do.

Wait, perhaps instead of the entire spot area being blocked, only a fraction is blocked when the star is viewed edge-on. Oh, but the star's rotation would make the spots come into and out of view, but the maximum dip is when the entire spot area is blocking. So the dip is the same as when the planet transits.

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering the variation in brightness as the star rotates, which would produce a similar light curve as a planet transiting. But the amplitude of the variation is the same as the planet's transit dip.

So the dip from the spots is 5.1775% of the star's brightness. So a planet would have to cause the same dip, which is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rp=0.2276 Rstar.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the dip.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the star's brightness is being modulated by the spots, but the maximum change in brightness is twice the dip I calculated.

Wait, no, because when the star is at the position where the spots are at the edge, the dip is maximum. So the dip is 5.1775%.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the relative change in brightness. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the relative change when the star is spot-free (F0) and when the spots are on the far side (F1). So during rotation, when the spots are not visible, the flux is F0. When the spots are on the near side, the flux is F_spotty.

So the dip is F0 - F_spotty = F0 - [ (1-f) + f ( (T-ΔT)/T )^4 ] F0.

= F0 [ 1 - (1-f) - f ( (T-ΔT)/T )^4 ) ].

= F0 [ f ( 1 - ( (T-ΔT)/T )^4 ) ].

So the dip is F0 - F_spotty = F0 * f (1 - (5/6)^4).

Which is 0.1 * 0.51775 F0 = 0.051775 F0.

So dip is 5.1775% of F0.

So the dip is 5.1775% of the star's brightness.

So to cause the same dip, the planet's area must be 5.1775% of the star's area.

Which is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rp= sqrt(0.051775) ≈0.2276 Rstar.

But again, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in considering f. The filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the maximum area of spots visible is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

But the star's total area is 4π R². So the fraction of the star covered by spots is 0.4π R² /4π R² = 0.1, as before.

Hmm. So where is the mistake?

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the relative change differently. Let me think: when the spots are on the near side, the flux is lower. The change in flux is F0 - F_spotty = F0 * 0.051775.

So the dip is 5.1775% of F0.

So for the planet, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 F0 → so (Rp/Rstar)^2 =0.051775 → Rp=0.2276 Rstar.

Again, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation during rotation, so the amplitude is twice the dip I calculated.

Wait, no, because the dip is the maximum change. The variation would be from F0 to F_spotty, which is a dip of 5.1775%.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me compute (5/6)^4 again.

5^4=625, 6^4=1296. 625/1296 ≈0.48225. So 1-0.48225=0.51775.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots being on the approaching and receding sides, which could cause a different effect. But I think that's more about Doppler shifts and not photometric brightness.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the spot coverage is per hemisphere, so when the star is viewed face-on, the spot coverage is 20% of the surface. So when the star's rotation makes the spots come into view, the fraction of the star's surface blocked is 20% of the total. So f=0.2.

Wait, that would be different. Let me try that.

If f=0.2, then dip is 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) =0.2 * 0.51775=0.10355, about 10.355% dip.

Then (Rp/Rstar)^2 =0.10355 → Rp ≈ sqrt(0.10355)≈ 0.3218 Rstar. Which is approximately 0.32, which is option D.

Ah! So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating f.

Wait, the question says the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So the spots take up 20% of the hemisphere's area. The hemisphere is half the star's surface, so 20% of 50% is 10% of the total surface. So f=0.1. But if instead, f=0.2 (20% of the total surface), then the dip would be about 10.355%, leading to Rp≈0.32, which is option D.

But why would f be 0.2? Because perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface.

Wait, the question says: one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's area covered by spots. So f_hemi=0.2. So the area of the hemisphere is 2π R². So spots' area is 0.2 * 2π R²=0.4 π R². The total star area is 4π R². So f_total=0.4 π R² /4 π R²= 0.1.

So the correct f is 0.1, leading to a dip of ~5.1775%.

But in that case, the planet's radius would be ~0.227 Rstar, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the area covered in spots as 20% of the star's surface, not just the hemisphere. So f=0.2.

Then dip would be f (1 - (5/6)^4 )=0.2 * 0.51775≈0.10355.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2=0.10355 → Rp≈0.3218 Rstar → 0.32, which is option D.

So perhaps the confusion is about whether the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere or 20% of the entire star.

The question says: one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So 'filling factor' is the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So f=0.2 * (hemisphere's area) / (entire star's area) =0.2 *0.5=0.1.

But perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface.

If that's the case, then f=0.2. Then dip is ~10.355%, leading to Rp=0.32 Rstar.

So the correct option would be D.

But the question says "filling factor of 20%", which in context refers to the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So f=0.1.

But since 0.32 is one of the options, perhaps the question expects f=0.2.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the brightness variation is a sinusoidal modulation due to the spots rotating into and out of view, which would have an amplitude based on the difference between the maximum and minimum flux.

Wait, perhaps the maximum dip is when the entire spotted area is facing us, and the minimum is when the spotted area is on the far side.

So the maximum dip is when the spotted area is fully visible: dip is 5.1775%.

The minimum is when the spotted area is on the far side, but the star's flux is higher.

Wait, when the star is in the 'no spots' side, the flux is F0.

When the star is in the 'spotty' side, the flux is F_spotty = F0 * (1 -0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 )).

Wait, no: F_spotty = F0 * [1 - 0.1 (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ] → because the 0.1 of the star is at lower flux.

So F_spotty = F0 * 0.9 + F0 * 0.1 * (5/6)^4.

Which is F0 * [0.9 + 0.1*(0.48225) ] = F0 * (0.9 +0.048225) = F0 * 0.948225.

So the flux varies between F0 and 0.948225 F0.

The amplitude of the variation would be (F0 - 0.948225 F0 ) /2 → because the variation goes from F0 down to 0.948225 F0 and back. So the peak-to-peak variation is 0.051775 F0, and the amplitude is half of that → 0.0258875 F0.

Wait, but in the case of the planet, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 F0. So the amplitude for the planet would be that dip, as it's a one-time dip in the middle of the light curve.

Wait, but the star's brightness variation is periodic and symmetric, so the amplitude is the maximum dip. So the amplitude is 5.1775% of F0.

So the planet's dip should be the same amplitude, so (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rp=0.2276 Rstar.

Again, not matching any options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Options: A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

If I had f=0.2, then Rp=0.32, which is option D. So perhaps the question intended f=0.2.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that when the star is observed, the spots are on one side, and the rest is normal, leading to a dip of 20% of the star's surface.

Wait, perhaps the problem says the spots cover 20% of the entire star's surface. So f=0.2. Then dip is 0.2*(1 - (5/6)^4 )= 0.2*(0.51775)=0.10355, so (Rp/Rstar)^2=0.10355→ Rp≈0.3218 Rstar, which is option D.

So perhaps the question intended that the filling factor is 20% of the entire surface, not just the hemisphere.

So the correct answer would be D) ~0.32.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the situation as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Same as the Sun.
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a **filling factor of 20%**, meaning 20% of the hemisphere's surface is covered by spots.
   - Spots are cooler by \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so their temperature is \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's total surface area is \( 4\pi R^2 \). A hemisphere has an area of \( 2\pi R^2 \), and 20% of this hemisphere is covered by spots. Thus, the total area covered by spots is:
     \[
     A_{\text{spots}} = 0.2 \times 2\pi R^2 = 0.4\pi R^2.
     \]
   - The fraction of the star's total surface area covered by spots is:
     \[
     f = \frac{A_{\text{spots}}}{4\pi R^2} = \frac{0.4\pi R^2}{4\pi R^2} = 0.1.
     \]

3. **Flux Calculation**:
   - The flux from a surface is proportional to \( T^4 \) (Stefan-Boltzmann law). The flux from the star's normal surface is \( F_{\text{normal}} = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \), and the flux from the spots is \( F_{\text{spot}} = \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4 \).
   - The fractional dip in brightness when the spots are visible is:
     \[
     \text{Dip} = f \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right).
     \]
   - Substituting \( f = 0.1 \), \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \):
     \[
     \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.48225.
     \]
     \[
     \text{Dip} = 0.1 \times (1 - 0.48225) = 0.1 \times 0.51775 = 0.051775 \, \text{(or 5.1775%)}.
     \]

4. **Exoplanet Brightness Variation**:
   - The brightness dip caused by an exoplanet is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius:
     \[
     \text{Dip}_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2.
     \]
   - Setting \( \text{Dip}_{\text{planet}} = \text{Dip}_{\text{spots}} = 0.051775 \), we solve for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.051775} \approx 0.2276.
     \]

5. **Revisiting the Filling Factor**:
   - If the filling factor is interpreted as 20% of the **entire star's surface** (instead of just the hemisphere), the total area covered by spots would be:
     \[
     A_{\text{spots}} = 0.2 \times 4\pi R^2 = 0.8\pi R^2.
     \]
     \[
     f = \frac{A_{\text{spots}}}{4\pi R^2} = 0.2.
     \]
   - Recalculating the dip:
     \[
     \text{Dip} = 0.2 \times (1 - 0.48225) = 0.2 \times 0.51775 = 0.10355 \, \text{(or 10.355%)}.
     \]
   - Solving for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \) in this case:
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218.
     \]

### Conclusion:
If the filling factor refers to 20% of the entire star's surface, the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \( 0.32 \), which matches **option D**. This interpretation aligns with the problem's intent, as the options provided suggest a larger radius than the \( 0.2276 \) calculated when \( f = 0.1 \).
