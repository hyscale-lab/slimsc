Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I should probably draw out the target molecule to visualize it better. The structure is benzene with three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1, 2, and 3. Wait, wait, no, benzene is a ring, so the numbering matters. Let me think: the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, and 3 is nitro. Or wait, no—no, I think the numbering should be such that the substituents are in the correct order. Let me check the IUPAC name. Oh, the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro.

Wait, but wait, how are these substituents arranged? So, benzene has three substituents in the 1,2,3 positions. So the structure would have ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, all three are adjacent to each other in a meta arrangement? No, wait, 1,2,3 are adjacent? No, 1,2,3 are every other position. Wait, in benzene, positions 1, 2, 3 would be in a row, each next to the other, so they are adjacent. Hmm, but wait, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in ortho, meta positions relative to each other.

But regardless, the key is to figure out the order of reactions to get these substituents in the right positions. Let me think about the directing effects of each substituent and how the reactions proceed.

So, benzene is the starting material. The substituents we need to add are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. Let me recall that nitro groups are strong meta directors. Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director. Tert-butyl is a bulky group and a strong para/ortho director, but being bulky, it would direct more towards para positions when possible.

But wait, wait: when adding substituents to a benzene ring, the order of addition matters because each substituent directs the next. So, the first substituent will direct where the second goes, and the second will influence where the third goes.

Wait, but in this case, we have three substituents. So, the order in which we add them will determine their final positions. Let me plan the order.

Looking at the target molecule, the substituents are at 1, 2, and 3. So, to get them in that arrangement, perhaps the first substituent is placed, then the next is added in a position relative to the first, and the third in another relative position.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think about the synthesis steps and see which substituent is best to add first, then the next, and so on.

Let me consider the substituents and their directing effects. Nitro groups are meta directors. But wait, if I add nitro first, then the next substituent would be directed by nitro. Nitro is a meta director, so the next substituent would go meta to it. But in the target, the ethoxy is adjacent to both the nitro and the tert-butyl. Hmm, maybe not the best approach.

Alternatively, perhaps adding the ethoxy group first. Ethoxy is a strong activating group, so it would be a good first substituent. Once ethoxy is on the benzene ring, the next substituent would be added either ortho, para to it.

Wait, but if I add the ethoxy first, then the next substituent will be ortho or para to it. Let's say the ethoxy is at position 1. Then, where would the tert-butyl go? If I add it next, it would go ortho (position 2) or para (position 4). But in the target, the tert-butyl is at position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy. So that's possible.

Then, after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the next substituent would be nitro. But nitro is a deactivating, meta-directing group. However, the nitro group in the target is at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy, but ortho to tert-butyl. Hmm.

Wait, but when the ring already has substituents, the next incoming group will be directed by the most powerful director. Let me think: ethoxy is activating, tert-butyl is also activating but a weak director. So which is a stronger director? The ethoxy is a strong activating group, so it would have a stronger directing effect than the tert-butyl. So, when adding the nitro group, which is a meta director, but since nitration is a meta-directing reaction, its position would be determined by the existing substituents.

Wait, but nitration is typically done under strong conditions, and nitro is a strong deactivating group. So, perhaps the nitro group is added last. Because once the ring has activating groups, adding nitro as a deactivating group would be challenging if done earlier, as it would slow down further reactions.

So perhaps the order is: add ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

Wait, but let me think again. The starting material is benzene. Let's consider each step.

Option 1: Add ethoxy group first.

Step 1: Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation? Wait, ethoxy is an ether group. To add an ethoxy group, you can use a Williamson ether synthesis approach, but more likely, using an ether as an electrophile. Wait, but benzene can't form an ether directly. Oh wait, perhaps using ethyl bromide with a Lewis acid catalyst? No, wait, Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation, but for ethers, you might use something else.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's under different conditions. Alternatively, maybe using an electrophilic substitution where the ethoxy is introduced as an activating group.

Wait, no, actually, maybe the ethoxy group comes from a nitration followed by some reaction. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps using a sulfonation step to activate the ring and direct substitution. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution reaction, like using an ether as an electrophile. Wait, benzene isn't typically alkylated with ethers. Oh, wait! Maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by a reduction. Hmm, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the ethoxy group as coming from a tosylate or similar. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each substituent: ethoxy is -OCH2CH3. To introduce that into benzene, I can perform a nucleophilic aromatic substitution if the ring is activated. But that's usually under high temperature and with a strong base. Alternatively, perhaps using a directing group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution). But for SNAr, the ring must be activated toward nucleophilic attack, which requires electron-withdrawing groups. Benzene itself isn't reactive enough for that.

Hmm, maybe I should think of the ethoxy group as being introduced after some other substituent that activates the ring. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is added via an etherification reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylations typically require alkyl halides, but they're prone to carbocation rearrangements. For ethoxy, maybe a better approach is to use an ether as the electrophile. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction after making a nitro group. Wait, maybe the nitro group is a meta director, and then the ethoxy is added in an appropriate position.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me try another approach: looking at the options provided.

The options are A, B, C, D. Each option lists a series of reactions. I'll need to figure out which sequence correctly adds the substituents in the right order to get the target molecule.

Looking at the target molecule: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro).

Let me think about the possible steps:

1. Introduce the first substituent. Let's say nitro, ethoxy, or tert-butyl.

2. Second substituent: position depends on the first.

3. Third substituent: position depends on the first two.

So, the order of adding substituents is crucial.

Alternatively, perhaps nitro is introduced first because it's a strong meta director, which would set the stage for where the other groups go.

Wait, but adding nitro first: benzene → nitration → nitrobenzene. Then, where would the ethoxy group go? Nitro is a meta director, so the ethoxy would go meta to nitro. Let's say nitro is at position 1. Then ethoxy would go to position 3. Then, the tert-butyl would go where? But then, the third substituent would be added.

But in the target, the substituents are at 1, 2, 3. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the initial substituent is tert-butyl. Let's see: benzene → alkylation with tert-butyl chloride, using AlCl3 as a catalyst (Friedel-Crafts alkylation). So after that, benzene would have a tert-butyl group at position 1 (assuming para isn't favored due to steric hindrance, but since tert-butyl is bulky, it would tend to go para less because of steric issues, but actually, for Friedel-Crafts alkylation, the substituent tends to go para because of the carbocation's stability. Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts alkylation tends to give para and ortho products, but for bulky groups like tert-butyl, the para product is more favorable due to less steric hindrance. So after alkylation, the ring has a tert-butyl group at para position? Wait, but wait, the target has tert-butyl at position 2. Hmm, perhaps that's not the best approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added first. Let me think: benzene → introduce ethoxy group. How? Using a Friedel-Crafts alkylation with ethyl chloride and AlCl3? But wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation typically gives alkyl benzene, not ether. Oh, right, I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution. But benzene isn't nucleophilic. Oh, wait, maybe using a directing group. For example, making a nitro group, which is meta-directing, then introducing ethoxy in the meta position. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction after activating the ring. Wait, maybe using a benzene ring with a good leaving group, but that's not the starting point here.

Wait, maybe another approach: what are the possible reactions in the options? Let's look at the options to see which reagents are involved.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Steps include tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts alkylation), then HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), then SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation), then NaNO2/HCl (diazotization), then dilute H2SO4, then H3O+ and heat (maybe hydrolysis?), then NaOH and EtBr (maybe Williamson ether?), Fe/HCl (catalyst?), and then HNO3/H2SO4 again.

Wait, that's a lot of steps, but I need to follow the logical order.

Option B: Steps include adding tert-butyl, then nitrate, then Fe/HCl (maybe a reduction?), another nitrate, etc.

Wait, perhaps I should outline each option step by step.

Option D steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene (nitro group at para position, but actually, nitration of benzene gives nitro group meta to any substituent, but without any substituent, it's para.

Wait, no, wait: when benzene is nitrated, the product is nitrobenzene, which is a meta director. But wait, no: benzene is symmetric, so nitration gives a single product, which is nitrobenzene, and nitro groups are meta directors.

But wait, if you nitrate benzene, you get nitrobenzene, but where? Actually, benzene without any substituents will form nitrobenzene, but the nitro group can be in any position, so it's actually a single structure, but when you add more substituents, their positions matter.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each option's steps:

Option D:

i) Nitration → benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → this is a reducing condition. Maybe reducing the nitro group to amine? Wait, Fe and HCl usually aren't strong enough for that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a catalyst for something else. Hmm.

iii) Alkylation with tert-butyl chloride → so Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But the ring is already substituted with nitro group.

Wait, nitro is a strong deactivating group, so Friedel-Crafts alkylation might not proceed easily. So adding tert-butyl after nitro might be difficult because nitro deactivates the ring.

So, step i is nitration, step ii uses Fe/HCl. Maybe step ii is for something else, like sulfonation? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the sequence is different. Let me think of each option's steps.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So benzene becomes tert-butylbenzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Sulfonic acid group is added as a strong activating group, which directs incoming substituents to para and ortho positions.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Nitro group would be added where? The ring has a tert-butyl group (meta director) and a sulfonic acid group (ortho/para director). But which group is more influential? Sulfonic acid is a strong activating, ortho/para director, but tert-butyl is activating and ortho/para as well. Wait, but nitration is a strong electrophilic substitution, so the most activating group would direct the incoming substituent.

But sulfonic acid is a strong activating group, so the nitration would occur ortho or para to the sulfonic acid.

Wait, but the target molecule has nitro at position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy. Hmm.

I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try to outline the possible steps for each option.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So, substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). So, the substituents are adjacent to each other, all in a row.

So, the three substituents are at 1, 2, 3 positions. So, that's a meta arrangement relative to each other, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the order of adding substituents.

Let me try to imagine adding substituents in the order of ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro.

1. First, add ethoxy. How? Maybe via nucleophilic substitution. But benzene is not nucleophilic. Alternative approach: perhaps using a directing group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps adding ethoxy as a substituent via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's tough because ethoxy isn't an alkyl halide. Alternatively, perhaps using an ethyl group and then oxidizing it. Hmm, but that's complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should think about introducing the ethoxy group via a substitution reaction. Wait, maybe using a tosyl group as an intermediate. Let me think: benzene is sulfonated (becomes benzene sulfonic acid), then treated with ethyl bromide under basic conditions to substitute the -SO3H group with ethoxy. But wait, that would require deprotonation, but benzene sulfonic acid is a strong acid.

Alternatively, perhaps sulfonating benzene, then performing a nucleophilic substitution with ethoxide. But I'm not sure about the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a Williamson ether synthesis, but that typically involves an alkoxide attacking an alkyl halide, which isn't applicable here.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. The ring has a tert-butyl group (ortho/para director). So nitration would occur at para or ortho to tert-butyl. So the nitro group would be at position 4 or 2 if tert-butyl is at position 1.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is at position 3. So if the tert-butyl is at position 1 (assuming para), then nitration would be at position 4 (para) or 2 (ortho). But target has nitro at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy. Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right path.

Option D starts with nitration.

Option D steps:

i) Nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction of nitro to amine? But I don't think Fe/HCl can do that. Alternatively, maybe it's a catalyst for some substitution.

iii) Alkylation with tert-butyl chloride.

But benzene rings with nitro groups are deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts alkylation might not proceed. So step iii would be difficult.

Hmm.

Option C starts with tert-butyl chloride:

i) Friedel-Crafts → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) sulfonation → adds a sulfonic acid group. Where? Ortho or para to tert-butyl.

iii) nitration → nitro group where? Sulfonic acid is a strong activating group, so nitration would be at ortho or para to sulfonic acid.

But the target has nitro at position 3. So, if tert-butyl is at position 1, and sulfonic acid is at position 2, then nitration would be at position 3 (ortho to sulfonic acid). That would fit.

Wait, let me visualize:

tert-butyl at position 1,

sulfonic acid at position 2,

nitro at position 3.

But then, after nitration, what's next?

iv) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction of nitro group. But why would that be needed?

Wait, in the target, nitro is present, so maybe the nitro isn't reduced.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps after that are for introducing the ethoxy group.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. But if the nitro group is present, I'm not sure.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again? Not sure.

vii) H3O+ and heat → maybe hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → acid workup.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps a substitution reaction, like a nucleophilic substitution to introduce ethoxy.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right order.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after activating the ring.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each substituent's position.

The target has nitro at position 3, ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2.

So, to get them all in a row, perhaps the steps would involve adding substituents in a way that each new group is adjacent to the previous ones.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy and tert-butyl are added in positions that are adjacent, and then the nitro is added next.

Wait, but how? Let me think again about the directing effects.

If I add tert-butyl first, then nitrate, the nitro group would be ortho or para to tert-butyl. Then, adding ethoxy would be directed by the nitro group, which is meta.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is: nitro first, then tert-butyl, then ethoxy.

Wait, let me try that.

1. Nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride → but wait, nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts won't proceed easily. So maybe this step won't work.

Hmm, that's a problem.

Another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is added second.

Wait, but how to get the ethoxy on the ring? Maybe via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that requires a good leaving group and activating substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after making the ring more activated.

Wait, perhaps after sulfonation, which activates the ring. So:

1. Sulfonation → benzene becomes benzene sulfonic acid.

2. Then, substitute the sulfonic acid group with ethoxy. How? Maybe using an ethyl halide under basic conditions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the sulfonic acid group is a good leaving group under certain conditions. For example, in a strongly basic environment, perhaps the -SO3H can leave as HSO3^- or something, allowing substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps using a nucleophilic aromatic substitution with ethoxide.

Wait, but benzene sulfonic acid has a strong -I effect, making the ring more susceptible to nucleophilic attack. So, perhaps under high temperature and pressure, substituting the sulfonic acid group with ethoxy.

But I'm not sure about the exact reagents or conditions for that step.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a different method.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Sulfonate to add a sulfonic acid group in a position ortho or para to tert-butyl.

3. Nitrate, which would go ortho to the sulfonic acid group.

4. Then, substitute the sulfonic acid group with ethoxy.

Wait, but how would that work?

Let me try to outline this.

Step 1: Friedel-Crafts alkylation → tert-butylbenzene.

Step 2: Sulfonation → sulfonic acid group added ortho or para to tert-butyl.

Let's say it's added at position 3 (meta to tert-butyl at position 1).

Step 3: Nitration → nitro group added ortho to sulfonic acid (position 4) or para (position 2). Hmm, but the target has nitro at position 3. Wait, no.

Alternatively, after sulfonating, the sulfonic acid group is at position 2. Then nitration would occur ortho (position 1 or 3) or para (position 5). So let's say nitro goes to position 3.

Step 4: Then, how to introduce ethoxy? Maybe substitute the sulfonic acid group at position 2 with ethoxy. But what reagents would do that?

Ah, perhaps using NaOH and ethyl bromide. But wait, that's the Williamson ether synthesis, which requires an alkoxide and an alkyl halide. Alternatively, perhaps using a nucleophilic aromatic substitution where the sulfonic acid group is replaced with ethoxy.

But I'm not sure about the exact conditions. Alternatively, maybe using a sulfonate ester and then eliminating the sulfonic acid group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution using NaOH and ethyl bromide, but I'm not certain.

Wait, looking back at the options, some of them involve NaOH with EtBr. For example, option B has step vii as NaOH and EtBr.

So, perhaps after adding the sulfonic acid group and nitro group, we substitute the sulfonic acid with ethoxy.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group comes earlier.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the correct option is D.

Wait, let's think about option D steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro group on benzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction of nitro to amine. Wait, nitrobenzene can be reduced to phenylamine using Fe and HCl (catalyst for hydrogenation?), but I'm not sure.

iii) Alkylation with tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → but nitro group is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts may not work. Hmm, perhaps that's a problem.

So, after step i and ii, we have aniline (phenylamine). Then, step iii would be Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Aniline is strongly activating, so alkylation should be possible.

So, step iii: alkylating aniline with tert-butyl chloride under AlCl3. So, tert-butyl group would be added to the aniline ring. Aniline is a strong activating group, so the tert-butyl would go ortho or para to the amino group.

Then, step iv: nitration again. Nitro group would be added meta to the amino group? Wait, but amino is a strong activating group, so nitration would be directed to ortho and para.

Wait, but after alkylation, the ring has amino and tert-butyl groups. Let me think:

Aniline (NH2 at position 1) → alkylation adds tert-butyl at position 4 (para), or 2 or 6 (ortho).

Then, nitration would add nitro at positions ortho or para to the amino group, but considering the existing substituents.

This is getting too convoluted. Let me think of the final structure.

The target has substituents at 1, 2, 3. So, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add nitro.

3. Add ethoxy.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution after activating the ring with another substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitro group.

2. Alkylate with tert-butyl → but as mentioned earlier, benzene rings with nitro groups are deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts may not proceed.

Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right approach. Let me think again about the options.

Looking at option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride → Friedel-Crafts → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate → sulfonic acid group at ortho or para to tert-butyl.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration: nitro group goes ortho to sulfonic acid (since it's a strong activating group), which would be position 3 if sulfonic acid is at position 2.

iv) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction of nitro to amine, but I don't know why.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again? Not sure.

vii) H3O+ and heat → hydrolysis, maybe of a diazonium salt.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → acid workup.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps a substitution to add ethoxy.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about each step in option C.

Step i: tert-butylbenzene.

Step ii: sulfonate, say, at position 2.

Step iii: nitrate, adds nitro at position 3 (ortho to sulfonic acid).

So now, we have tert-butyl at 1, sulfonic acid at 2, nitro at 3.

Then, step iv: Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to NH2? But why?

Wait, after nitration, we have nitro at 3. Then, step iv is Fe and HCl. I'm not sure what this does.

Alternatively, perhaps step iv is to do something else, like remove the sulfonic acid group.

Wait, if step iv is Fe/HCl, maybe it's a catalyst for some substitution. Or perhaps it's used in a diazotization step.

Wait, step v is NaNO2/HCl → diazotization, which typically occurs with aryl amines. But if nitro group is present, perhaps this step doesn't proceed.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me think of the correct order of substituents.

Another approach: to get substituents in positions 1, 2, 3, perhaps we need to add nitro and ethoxy in such a way that they are adjacent, and then add tert-butyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added first, then nitro, then tert-butyl.

Wait, but how to add ethoxy first.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add nitro.

3. Add ethoxy.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking back at the target molecule, the substituents are at 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). So, perhaps the correct order is ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro. But how to get each step.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution after making the ring more activated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added as the last substituent.

Let me think about the nitration step. Nitration is usually done when the ring is activated, so perhaps nitro is added after activating groups like ethoxy or tert-butyl.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add ethoxy group.

2. Add tert-butyl group.

3. Add nitro group.

But I need to figure out how to add the ethoxy group first.

Wait, another thought: perhaps ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution after introducing a good leaving group, like a nitro group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after sulfonating the ring, making it more nucleophilic.

Wait, benzene sulfonic acid is more reactive towards nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not sure about the exact conditions.

Another approach: considering the options, perhaps the correct option is option B.

Looking at option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate → nitro group added ortho or para.

Assuming tert-butyl is at position 1, nitro could be at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para).

If nitro is at position 2, then next steps:

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction of nitro to amine. If so, position 2 becomes amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again. But if the ring has a NH2 group at position 2 and tert-butyl at 1, the next nitration would go meta to NH2, which is position 5.

That doesn't seem to fit the target.

Alternatively, perhaps step iv is another nitration, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the nitro group as being added in the correct position after other substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add ethoxy.

3. Add nitro.

So, in that order.

Adding tert-butyl first (Friedel-Crafts), then ethoxy, which is ortho/para to tert-butyl, then nitro, which is ortho to ethoxy.

But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D.

Looking at option D:

i) Nitrate → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine.

iii) Alkylate with tert-butyl chloride → add tert-butyl to aniline. Aniline is strong activating, so tert-butyl goes ortho or para to NH2.

iv) Nitrate again → nitro group added ortho or para to NH2, but considering the existing substituents.

v) Diazotization → form diazonium salt.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate? Or maybe other steps.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Another approach: perhaps the synthesis involves introducing the ethoxy group via a substitution after making the ring more activated.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after introducing a good leaving group, like a nitro group.

Wait, but nitro groups are meta directors, so perhaps that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by a reduction. For example:

1. Friedel-Crafts acylation with ethyl chloride → forms ethyl benzene ketone.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Friedel-Crafts acylation uses acyl chloride, not ethyl chloride.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after making the ring more activated with a nitro group.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps involve first adding tert-butyl, then sulfonating, then nitrating, then substituting the sulfonic acid with ethoxy.

So, in terms of the options, perhaps option C does this.

Option C steps:

i) tert-butyl chloride → add tert-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate → adds -SO3H group ortho/para to tert-butyl.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate → adds nitro group ortho to sulfonic acid.

iv) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+/heat → hydrolysis.

vii) dilute H2SO4.

viii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

Wait, perhaps in step viii, the -SO3H group is replaced with ethoxy.

So, if tert-butyl is at position 1, sulfonic acid at 2, nitro at 3.

Then, after steps iv and v, perhaps the nitro group is converted to a diazonium salt, which is then hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but step vi is HNO3 again. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps in step vi, the nitro group is converted to a hydroxyl group via hydrolysis of the diazonium salt.

Wait, if we have a nitro group at position 3, and we perform diazotization (steps iv and v), then treat with H2O (step vi) to get a hydroxyl group at position 3. Then, perhaps sulfonic acid is at position 2, and tert-butyl at position 1.

But then, step vii is dilute H2SO4—maybe an acid workup.

Step viii is H3O+ and heat—maybe something else.

Step ix is NaOH and EtBr → perhaps a Williamson ether synthesis to replace the sulfonic acid group with ethoxy.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 reaction, but that's unlikely in aromatic rings.

Hmm, this is really challenging. Let me try to think of each option's final product.

Option B:

Steps after nitration and Fe/HCl: perhaps after nitration, the nitro group is reduced to amine. Then, alkylating with tert-butyl chloride would add tert-butyl to the ring. Then, another nitration, and so on.

Option D:

After nitration and reduction, alkylating to add tert-butyl. Then another nitration.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is: tert-butyl, then nitro, then ethoxy.

Looking back at the options, I'm more inclined towards option C.

In option C:

i) tert-butyl added.

ii) sulfonated.

iii) nitro added ortho to sulfonic acid.

Then, steps iv to ix would introduce ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps after nitration, the sulfonic acid is replaced with ethoxy.

So, in option C, step ix is NaOH and EtBr, which is likely a nucleophilic substitution to replace a leaving group with ethoxy.

If the sulfonic acid group is replaced with ethoxy, then the substituents would be:

tert-butyl at 1, ethoxy at 2, nitro at 3.

Which matches the target!

So, the steps in option C would be:

1. Add tert-butyl (position 1).

2. Add sulfonic acid (position 2).

3. Nitrate → nitro at position 3 (ortho to sulfonic acid).

Then, steps iv to ix: reduce nitro to amine, but perhaps that's not needed. Alternatively, maybe steps iv and beyond are for hydrolyzing or introducing the ethoxy group.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is not reduced, but instead, the sulfonic acid is replaced with ethoxy.

So, step ix: NaOH and EtBr would substitute the sulfonic acid group with ethoxy.

Wait, but sulfonic acid is a strong acid. How would it react with NaOH and EtBr? Maybe it's more about an SN2 displacement, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents after step iii are tert-butyl (1), sulfonic acid (2), nitro (3). Then, step ix replaces sulfonic acid with ethoxy, giving ethoxy (2), tert-butyl (1), nitro (3). But the target has ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So that doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the order.

Wait, if in option C, after steps i-iii, the substituents are tert-butyl at 1, sulfonic acid at 2, nitro at 3.

Then, step ix is NaOH and EtBr, which would substitute the sulfonic acid (position 2) with ethoxy. So ethoxy would be at position 2, not 1. But the target has ethoxy at position 1.

So that's not correct.

Hmm, maybe I got the order wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps in option C, the sulfonic acid is added after the tert-butyl, but the nitro is added in a different position.

Wait, perhaps after adding tert-butyl at position 1, the sulfonic acid is added at position 3.

Then, nitration would add nitro at position 2 (ortho to sulfonic acid). So substituents would be:

tert-butyl (1), sulfonic acid (3), nitro (2).

Then, substituting sulfonic acid with ethoxy would give ethoxy (3), tert-butyl (1), nitro (2). But the target has ethoxy at 1, so that's not matching.

This is really tricky. I think I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think of another approach.

The target has substituents at 1, 2, 3. So, perhaps the correct order is to add tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

So, how to add ethoxy after tert-butyl.

After adding tert-butyl (position 1), ethoxy is added at position 2 (ortho to tert-butyl), then nitro is added at position 3 (ortho to ethoxy and meta to tert-butyl).

So, the steps would be:

1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation → tert-butyl at 1.

2. Introduce ethoxy at 2.

3. Nitrate → nitro at 3.

Now, how to introduce ethoxy at 2 after adding tert-butyl.

Perhaps, after adding tert-butyl, sulfonate to add a group at 2 (ortho to tert-butyl), then substitute that with ethoxy.

So, steps would be:

i) tert-butyl chloride → Friedel-Crafts → tert-butyl at 1.

ii) sulfonate → sulfonic acid at 2.

iii) substitute sulfonic acid with ethoxy → ethoxy at 2.

iv) nitrate → nitro at 3.

Looking at the options, which option follows this order?

Looking at option C:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) sulfonate.

iii) nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl.

v) NaNO2.

vi) nitrate.

vii) H3O+.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr.

So, after steps i-iii, we have tert-butyl at 1, sulfonic acid at 2, nitro at 3.

Then, step ix: NaOH and EtBr would substitute the sulfonic acid at 2 with ethoxy.

So, the substituents would be:

tert-butyl at 1, ethoxy at 2, nitro at 3.

But the target has ethoxy at 1, so that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I got the order wrong. Maybe the ethoxy is added before nitro.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added first.

No, I'm getting stuck again.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I'll go with option C as the correct answer, because it seems to involve adding the substituents in the correct positions after sulfonation and nitration.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the sequence of reactions must carefully consider the directing effects of substituents and the order in which they are introduced. The target molecule has substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**: The sequence includes multiple steps such as alkylation, nitration, sulfonation, diazotization, and hydrolysis. However, the order of introducing substituents does not align with the target structure. The nitro group and ethoxy group would likely end up in incorrect positions relative to the tert-butyl group.

2. **Option B**: The sequence begins with alkylation to introduce the tert-butyl group, followed by nitration. However, the subsequent steps (e.g., Fe/HCl, additional nitration) do not clearly lead to the correct placement of the ethoxy group at position 1. The sequence appears disjointed and does not consistently direct substituents to the desired positions.

3. **Option C**: The sequence starts with alkylation to introduce the tert-butyl group, followed by sulfonation to add a sulfonic acid group. Nitration then introduces the nitro group ortho to the sulfonic acid group. Subsequent steps, including diazotization, hydrolysis, and substitution with NaOH/EtBr, allow for the replacement of the sulfonic acid group with an ethoxy group. This sequence logically places the substituents in the correct positions: tert-butyl at position 1, nitro at position 3, and ethoxy at position 2. However, the final substitution step introduces the ethoxy group at position 2, which does not match the target structure.

4. **Option D**: The sequence begins with nitration, followed by reduction and alkylation. However, nitro groups are deactivating, making Friedel-Crafts alkylation (step iii) unlikely to proceed efficiently. The sequence does not consistently direct substituents to the desired positions, and the final structure does not match the target.

### Conclusion:
Option C provides the most logical sequence for introducing substituents in the correct positions, despite the final substitution step placing the ethoxy group at position 2 instead of position 1. This discrepancy suggests a minor issue in the sequence, but overall, Option C aligns most closely with the desired synthesis.
