Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question gives me a lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The term is written as L(y) equals -lambda f times the bar psi f times (upsilon plus X(y)) times psi f(y). Wait, I think I remember that in the Standard Model, the Higgs field couples to fermions, giving them mass. So this looks similar. The boson X here must be like a Higgs-like particle because it's interacting with fermions via Yukawa coupling.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So I need to find out which fermions it can decay into, kinematically. Kinematically allowed means that the boson's mass should be at least twice the mass of the fermion pair, right? Because each fermion would have some mass, and for X to decay into a pair, 2m_fermion must be less than or equal to m_X.

Wait, but wait—what particles are we talking about here? The given lagrangian suggests that X couples to some fermions, but which ones? Looking at the options, they include particles like b quarks, s quarks, top quarks, charged leptons, etc. So I need to figure out which fermions X can couple to, considering the mass limits.

But wait, the problem is about the lowest order decays. So the possible decays are two-body decays, like X → f fbar. So each decay channel depends on whether X can couple to that fermion and if the mass allows it.

First, let's list the fermions that X can interact with. The term given is lambda f bar_psi f (y) (upsilon + X(y)) psi_f(y). Hmm, I think the notation here is a bit unclear, but perhaps it's a Yukawa coupling where X interacts with fermions f. So the possible fermions would be those for which the interaction term is present. But the way it's written, it's a generic term, so maybe X can interact with any fermion that has a mass term here.

Wait, but the question says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by..." So the fermions in the interaction term are the ones that X can decay into. So the fermions in the interaction are f, which are the possible decay products. So the fermions f must satisfy that their mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV, since X is 6 GeV and 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV → m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So what fermions are lighter than or equal to 3 GeV?

Let me think about the masses of the known fermions.

Leptons: electrons, muons, taus. The tau is about 1.78 GeV, muon is about 0.1 GeV (but wait, no—wait, no, the muon mass is about 0.1 GeV? Wait, no: 0.1 GeV is 100 MeV. Oh wait, wait. Electrons are about 0.0005 GeV, muons are about 0.105 GeV, taus are about 1.78 GeV.

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. The up and down are light, around a few MeV each. Strange is about 100 MeV, charm is around 1.5 GeV, bottom is around 4.5 GeV, top is way heavier, like 173 GeV.

Wait, but wait: the quark masses vary depending on the context (like current versus constituent mass), but the current masses are lower. For example, the up and down are about 2-5 MeV, strange maybe 50-100 MeV, charm around 1.5 GeV, bottom around 4.5 GeV, and top is 173 GeV.

So for the fermions that X can decay into, their mass must be less than or equal to 3 GeV. So which fermions have m_f ≤ 3 GeV?

Let me list them:

- Electron: m ≈ 0.0005 GeV → yes.
- Muon: ~0.105 GeV → yes.
- Tau: ~1.78 GeV → yes. Wait, but 1.78 is less than 3 GeV, so yes.
- Up: ~2 MeV → yes.
- Down: ~4-5 MeV → yes.
- Strange: ~100 MeV → yes.
- Charm: ~1.5 GeV → yes.
- Bottom: ~4.5 GeV → 4.5 > 3, so no.
- Top: way too heavy, so no.

Wait, but wait: the coupling. The interaction term will determine which fermions are involved. So the term given in the Lagrangian is -λ f barψf (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps this is a Yukawa coupling, so the fermion f must have a Yukawa coupling with X. So the possible fermions are any that are part of this interaction. But the question is which fermions are present in the interaction, which depends on which fermions have a non-zero coupling λ.

Wait, but the problem statement doesn't specify which fermions f are included in the interaction term. So perhaps the interaction is such that X can couple to all fermions, but only those with mass less than 3 GeV can be decay products.

Wait, but that can't be right because in reality, the Higgs couples to all fermions, but their masses (and thus decay modes) depend on their individual masses.

But in this problem, the interaction is given, so perhaps the fermions f are all possible particles that have a Yukawa coupling with X. So the possible decay channels are any f fbar where m_f <= 3 GeV.

So looking at the options:

Option A: X→ b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, e+ e−.

But wait, the b quark is about 4.5 GeV. So 2*m_b is about 9 GeV, which is way higher than X's mass of 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b quarks. So option A is incorrect because of the b quark.

Option B: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

The c quark is about 1.5 GeV. 2*1.5 is 3 GeV, so that's allowed. So c cbar is possible. So the decay into charm quarks is possible. Also, tau, mu, e are fine. So this option includes c cbar, which is allowed. So option B is a possible candidate.

Option C: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+, tau−, ..., etc.

Wait, top quark is way too heavy. X is 6 GeV, and top is 173 GeV. So X can't decay into top quarks. So option C is invalid because it includes t tbar.

Option D: X→ b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

Again, the b quark is too heavy. So option D includes b bbar, which is not allowed.

Wait, so in the available options:

Only option B includes c cbar, which is allowed (since 2m_c ≈3 GeV), and excludes the heavier quarks like b and t.

Wait, but wait a second: the strange quark (s) is about 100 MeV, so 2m_s is 200 MeV, much less than 6 GeV. So s sbar is allowed.

Similarly, u and d quarks are also way below 3 GeV.

So the possible fermions X can decay into are:

- e+ e−
- mu+ mu−
- tau+ tau−
- u u-bar
- d d-bar
- s s-bar
- c c-bar

Because their masses are all under 3 GeV except for b and t.

Wait, but wait: the tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2m_tau is about 3.56 GeV, which is more than X's mass of 6 GeV? Wait, no, 1.78 GeV *2 is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau pair is allowed.

Wait, wait, 6 GeV is larger than 3.56 GeV, so yes, X can decay into tau+ tau−.

But wait, what about the bottom quark in option D? Its mass is 4.5 GeV, 2m_b is 9 GeV, which is way higher than 6 GeV, so decay into b bbar is not allowed.

So checking the options again:

Option A includes b, which is too heavy. So no.

Option B includes c, which is allowed.

Option C includes t, which is way too heavy, so no.

Option D includes b, which is too heavy, so no.

So the correct option should be B, which includes c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

Wait, but let me make sure: what about the charm quark's mass? If X is 6 GeV, 2m_c is about 3 GeV, so yes, X can decay into c cbar. Because 3 GeV <= 6 GeV.

So the allowed decay channels are those where the fermion pair's combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV. So any fermion with m_f ≤ 3 GeV can be a decay product.

Thus, the correct answer is option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on its interaction with fermions. The interaction term provided resembles a Yukawa coupling, where \( X \) couples to fermions \( f \). For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the combined mass of the fermion pair, \( 2m_f \), must be less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This implies \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

The fermion masses are as follows:
- Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 5 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 100 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

From this, the fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \). Therefore, the allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \to e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^-, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c} \).

Now, analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed for the same reason as in Option A. **Incorrect**.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
