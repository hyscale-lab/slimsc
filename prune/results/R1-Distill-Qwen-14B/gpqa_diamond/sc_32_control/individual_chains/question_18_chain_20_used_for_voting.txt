Alright, so I have this question about stellar abundances and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Okay, let's see what the question says.

We've got two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But wait, the problem states that LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) is assumed, and the elemental abundances are determined using the EW (Equivalent Width) method. Hmm, I remember that EW method is related to measuring the abundance of elements based on the strength of spectral lines. But maybe the specific method details aren't too important here.

The given abundances are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the solar photospheric compositions are:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

I think I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, [nSi_1 / nSi_2], I guess.

Wait, how do these abundance ratios work? The notation [X/Y]_Star means log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_Sun, right? Because that's the definition of a stellar abundance ratio in dex (decimal exponent).

So for [Fe/H]_1 = 0, that means log(nFe_1 / nH_1) - log(nFe_sun / nH_sun) = 0. So, log(nFe_1/nH_1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun). Therefore, nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun. Oh wait, but the given solar photospheric composition is 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5. So the Sun's log(nFe/nH) is 7.5 -12 = -4.5. That's because when you have 12 + log(...), the value inside is 10^(-4.5) for Fe over H.

Wait, let's compute the Sun's [Fe/H] and [Mg/H]. Since [Fe/H]_sun is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) = 0 by definition. So for the Sun, [Fe/H] is 0, same with [Mg/H] being 0.

So, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means log(nFe_1/nH_1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun). So nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

Now, let's look at the other ratios.

For Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = 0.3 + [Fe/Fe]_sun (which is 0). So log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = 0.3. Therefore, nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^0.3.

But wait, for the Sun, [Fe/Fe]_sun is zero, so the [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

So, [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi_1 / nFe_1) - log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) = 0.3.

So, log(nSi_1/(nFe_1)) = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

Wait, maybe I should compute the ratios in terms of the Sun's values.

Let me think. Let's denote:

For any star, [X/Y] = log(nX / nY) - log(nX_sun / nY_sun).

So,

log(nX/nY) = [X/Y] + log(nX_sun / nY_sun).

So for Star_1:

log(nSi_1 / nFe_1) = [Si/Fe]_1 + log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

But wait, what is nSi_sun / nFe_sun? Let's compute that.

The Sun's composition is given as:

12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH=10^(-4.5).

Similarly, log(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=10^(-5).

But what about nSi/nH? Hmm, the question doesn't give that. Oh, that's a problem. Because without knowing nSi/nH for the Sun, I can't proceed directly.

Wait, but maybe I can express [Si/Fe] in terms of [Fe/H] and other abundances.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything relative to hydrogen.

Let me try this approach.

First, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1=0 → log(nFe_1/nH_1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

So, let’s denote nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

But for the Sun, nFe_sun = 10^(-4.5) * nH_sun (since nFe/nH_sun = 10^(-4.5)).

Thus, nFe_1 = (10^(-4.5) * nH_sun) / nH_sun * nH_1 = 10^(-4.5) * nH_1.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → [Si/Fe] is log(nSi_1/nFe_1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) =0.3.

So, log(nSi_1/nFe_1) =0.3 + log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But I don't have nSi_sun/nFe_sun. Wait, but for the Sun, [Si/Fe]_sun is zero, because [X/Y] for the same element in the Sun is zero.

Wait, no, [Si/Fe]_sun would be log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) =0, right? So nSi_sun/nFe_sun is 1.

Because [X/Y] for the Sun is zero.

So, log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) =0.

So, for Star_1:

log(nSi_1/nFe_1) =0.3 +0=0.3 → nSi_1/nFe_1=10^0.3 ≈ 2. So nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 2.

But we know nFe_1= 10^(-4.5) *nH_1. So nSi_1 = 2 * 10^(-4.5) *nH_1.

Now, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) =0.3.

But [Mg/Si]_sun is log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )=0 → so log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun)=0 → nMg_sun/nSi_sun=1.

Wait, no, [Mg/Si] for the Sun is zero. So, log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) = [Mg/Si]_sun =0 → nMg_sun/nSi_sun=1 → nSi_sun =nMg_sun.

But wait, the Sun's nMg/nH is 10^(-5), and nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5), but what about nSi/nH? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can express nSi in terms of nMg, using the Sun's composition.

Wait, let me think. For the Sun, nMg/nH is 10^(-5), and nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5). But what about nSi/nH?

Wait, the problem gives us the Sun's photospheric composition for Fe and Mg, but not Si. So perhaps I need to find nSi_sun in terms of nFe_sun or nMg_sun.

Wait, but without that data, I can’t directly compute it. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the ratio of Si in terms of Fe and Mg, which are given.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach would be better.

Let me consider the approach of expressing all the ratios relative to hydrogen, and then compute [Si/H] for each star, then find the ratio.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1=0 → [Fe/H] = log(nFe_1/nH_1) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) =0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi_1/nFe_1) =0.3 + [Si/Fe]_sun → but [Si/Fe]_sun is 0, so log(nSi_1/nFe_1)=0.3 → nSi_1/nFe_1 =10^0.3 ≈2.

So nSi_1 = 2 * nFe_1.

But nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) *nH_1 → so nSi_1 = 2 * (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) *nH_1.

But nFe_sun =10^(-4.5)*nH_sun → substituting:

nSi_1= 2 * (10^(-4.5) *nH_sun /nH_sun ) *nH_1 → 2 *10^(-4.5) nH_1.

So, nSi_1 = 2 *10^(-4.5) * nH_1.

Similarly, for [Si/H]_1, which is log(nSi_1/nH_1) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun).

We can calculate log(nSi_1/nH_1) = log(2 *10^(-4.5) nH_1 /nH_1 ) = log(2 *10^(-4.5)).

Which is log(2) + (-4.5) ≈ 0.3010 -4.5 = -4.199.

The solar log(nSi/nH) is given by log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) → which is 12 + log(nSi/nH) = something? Wait, no. Wait the Sun's data for Fe and Mg is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → so log(nFe/nH) =-4.5.

Similarly, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) =-5.

But what about for Si? The question didn't provide that, so we can't directly get log(nSi/nH)_sun.

Hmm, this is a problem. Because without knowing nSi/nH for the Sun, I cannot compute [Si/H]_1.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the other star, Star_2.

Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2=0.3, and [Mg/H]_2=0.

So, [Mg/H]_2=0 → log(nMg_2/nH_2) = log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) → nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun).

But nMg_sun =10^(-5) *nH_sun.

So, nMg_2 =10^(-5) *nH_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun) )=10^(-5) *nH_2.

Now, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) =0.3 + log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

But [Mg/Si]_sun is log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) =0 → so log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) = [Mg/Si]_sun =0 → nMg_sun =nSi_sun.

So, nMg_sun =nSi_sun → nSi_sun =nMg_sun.

But nMg_sun is 10^(-5)*nH_sun → so nSi_sun=10^(-5)*nH_sun.

So, for Star_2, log(nMg_2/nSi_2) =0.3 +0=0.3 → nMg_2/nSi_2=10^0.3 ≈2 → nMg_2 =2 *nSi_2.

But nMg_2 =10^(-5) *nH_2 → so 10^(-5) *nH_2 =2 *nSi_2 → nSi_2 = (10^(-5)/2) *nH_2 = (10^(-5.3)) *nH_2.

Wait, 10^(-5)/2 is 5e-6, which is 10^(-5.3010) because log(2)=0.3010.

So, nSi_2 =10^(-5.3) *nH_2.

Wait, but how can I relate this to Star_1's nSi_1?

Because I need to find the ratio nSi_1 /nSi_2.

nSi_1 is 2 *10^(-4.5) *nH_1.

nSi_2 is 10^(-5.3) *nH_2.

But to find the ratio, I need to consider the ratio of nH_1 and nH_2.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give any information about the overall hydrogen content of the stars. Oh wait, but in stars, the total number of hydrogen atoms is usually a large fraction of the total, and I think for stars with similar masses, the H content could be similar, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the H content is considered to be the same for both stars in this context, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ratio of H in the two stars is the same as the ratio of the star's masses? Or perhaps the number of H atoms is the same as the star's mass, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, the number of H atoms depends on the star's composition. Wait, but perhaps the problem assumes that the number of H atoms (nH) is the same for both stars. But that's a big assumption. Alternatively, perhaps all the stars have the same metallicity, but not necessarily the same H content.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about the relative abundances, and the actual nH cancels out. Let's think.

nSi_1 = 2 *10^(-4.5) *nH_1.

nSi_2 =10^(-5.3) *nH_2.

So the ratio is (2e-4.5 *nH_1) / (1e-5.3 *nH_2) )= (2e-4.5 / 1e-5.3) ) * (nH_1 / nH_2).

Which is (2 *10^(-4.5 +5.3) )) * (nH_1 /nH_2) )= 2 *10^(0.8) * (nH_1/nH_2).

10^0.8 is approximately 6.31 (since 10^0.8= around 6.3).

So, 2 *6.31=12.62, so approximately 12.62 * (nH_1/nH_2).

Wait, but I don't know the ratio of nH_1 and nH_2. Hmm, but how?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in earlier steps. Let me re-examine.

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) =10^(-4.5) *nH_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) )=10^(-4.5) *nH_1.

Wait, no, let me recompute:

nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) ) *nH_1.

Because [Fe/H] = log(nFe_1/nH_1) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) ) =0 → so nFe_1/nH_1 =nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH_1.

Since nFe_sun/nH_sun =10^(-4.5), so nFe_1 =10^(-4.5) *nH_1.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(nSi_1/nFe_1) =0.3 → nSi_1 =nFe_1 *10^0.3=10^(-4.5) *nH_1 *10^0.3.

So nSi_1 =10^(-4.5 +0.3) *nH_1 =10^(-4.2) *nH_1.

Wait, 10^(-4.5 +0.3)=10^(-4.2) ≈6.31e-5.

Wait, earlier I thought nSi_1= 2e-4.5 *nH_1, but now with the correct calculation, it's 10^(-4.2) *nH_1. That's different.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2)=0.3 + log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

But since [Mg/Si]_sun is 0, log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun)=0 → nMg_sun =nSi_sun.

Thus, log(nMg_2/nSi_2)=0.3 → nMg_2 =nSi_2 *10^0.3.

But [Mg/H]_2=0 → log(nMg_2/nH_2)= log(nMg_sun/nH_sun)= -5.

So nMg_2 =10^(-5) *nH_2.

Putting it together:

nMg_2 =nSi_2 *10^0.3 → 10^(-5) *nH_2 =nSi_2 *10^0.3 → nSi_2 = (10^(-5) *nH_2) /10^0.3.

Which is 10^(-5 -0.3)*nH_2 =10^(-5.3) *nH_2.

So, nSi_2 =10^(-5.3) *nH_2.

Now, the ratio of nSi_1 to nSi_2 is:

nSi_1 /nSi_2 = [10^(-4.2) *nH_1] / [10^(-5.3) *nH_2 ]

Which simplifies to 10^(-4.2 +5.3) ) * (nH_1 /nH_2 )

=10^(1.1) * (nH_1 /nH_2 )

10^1.1 is approximately 12.589.

So the ratio is approximately 12.589 * (nH_1 /nH_2 ).

But I still don't know the ratio of H in the two stars. So, I'm stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the H is the same in both stars. Or perhaps the number of H atoms is proportional to the mass of the star. Oh, wait, the masses are given: Star_1 is 1.5 solar masses, Star_2 is 1.2 solar masses.

But wait, the mass of a star is the sum of the masses of all its components. The number of H atoms depends on the mass of H in the star. So, the number of H atoms nH is proportional to (mass of H) / (mass per H atom). Since the mass per H atom is the same, nH is proportional to the mass of H.

Wait, but how much H is in each star? That depends on the star's metallicity. Because [Fe/H] tells us the metallicity.

Wait, Star_1: [Fe/H]_1=0 → same as the Sun.

Star_2: [Mg/H]_2=0 → same as the Sun.

Wait, but [Fe/H] is a measure of the abundance of metals relative to H. So if [Fe/H]_1 is 0, the metal content is the same as the Sun. Similarly for Star_2.

Wait, but if both stars have the same metallicity as the Sun, then the mass of H would be approximately the same fraction, but perhaps the total H is proportional to the total mass, assuming similar compositions.

Wait, but this is getting into more complicated territory. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio nH_1/nH_2 is equal to M_1/M_2, where M is the total mass of the star. Because if the star is more massive, perhaps it has more H, assuming similar composition.

Wait, but the mass of a star isn't just H. It's H plus heavier elements. So, if the metallicity is the same, the mass of H would be (Mass) * (mass fraction of H).

Wait, but I don't think we have the mass fractions of H for each star. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the number of hydrogen atoms in each star is the same, but that seems unlikely because their masses are different. Or perhaps the problem neglects the variation in H, considering that the stars have similar metallicity.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is possible by considering that the [X/H] abundance ratios are the same as the Sun, so perhaps the total number of H is the same for both stars. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that the stars have the same metallicity as the Sun. Because [Fe/H]_1=0 and [Mg/H]_2=0. So, for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0 → same as the Sun's iron abundance. Similarly, Star_2, [Mg/H]=0 → same as the Sun's magnesium abundance.

If both stars have the same overall metallicity as the Sun, then their H abundance is the same as the Sun's. Therefore, the number of H atoms would be the same proportion of their total mass as in the Sun.

But wait, the Sun's mass is 1 solar mass. Star_1 is 1.5 solar masses, Star_2 is 1.2. So, if both have same metallicity, then the number of H atoms would be proportional to their mass.

Because the mass of H in the star is mass_fraction_H * M, and number of H atoms is (mass_H) / (mass_per_H atom). Since the mass fraction of H is the same as Sun, the number of H atoms would be proportional to M.

So, nH_1 = (M_1 / M_sun) * nH_sun.

Similarly, nH_2 = (M_2 / M_sun) *nH_sun.

So, nH_1 /nH_2 = (M_1 / M_sun) / (M_2 / M_sun) )= M_1 / M_2 =1.5/1.2=5/4=1.25.

So, the ratio nH_1/nH_2 =1.25.

So, going back to the ratio nSi_1/nSi_2:

=10^(1.1) * (nH_1/nH_2 )

=12.589 *1.25 ≈15.736.

But wait, that's not matching any of the options. The options are A) ~3.9, B) ~12.6, C) ~0.8, D) ~1.2.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, let's re-calculate the ratio.

nSi_1 =10^(-4.2) *nH_1.

nSi_2=10^(-5.3)*nH_2.

So,

nSi_1/nSi_2 = [10^(-4.2) *nH_1 ] / [10^(-5.3)*nH_2 ]

=10^(1.1) * (nH_1 /nH_2 )

10^1.1 is about 12.589, and nH_1/nH_2 =1.25.

So 12.589 *1.25 ≈15.736.

But that's not one of the options. So, perhaps my assumption about nH_1/nH_2 being 1.25 is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the number of H atoms doesn't scale with the mass of the star. Maybe the problem assumes that the number of H atoms is the same in both stars, so nH_1 =nH_2.

If that's the case, then the ratio becomes 10^(1.1) ≈12.589, which is close to option B (~12.6).

But why would nH be the same? That would imply that the stars have the same number of H atoms, which isn't necessarily true because their masses are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't require considering the H ratio, and I should proceed under the assumption that nH_1 and nH_2 are not relevant. Wait, but without considering them, I can't get the ratio.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach.

Let's compute the [Si/H] for each star.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3, [Fe/H]_1=0.

So,

log(nSi_1/nFe_1) =0.3 → nSi_1 =nFe_1 *10^0.3.

And,

[Fe/H]_1=0 → log(nFe_1/nH_1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) → nFe_1 =nFe_sun *nH_1/nH_sun.

So,

nSi_1 =nFe_1 *10^0.3 = (nFe_sun *nH_1/nH_sun) ) *10^0.3.

But nFe_sun = nFe_sun /nH_sun *nH_sun.

Wait, now, [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi_1/nH_1) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun).

nSi_1/nH_1 = (nFe_sun *nH_1/nH_sun *10^0.3 ) /nH_1 )= (nFe_sun/nH_sun ) *10^0.3.

Which is [Fe/H]_sun *10^0.3.

Wait, [Fe/H]_sun is 0, so log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) =-4.5.

So,

log(nSi_1/nH_1) = log( (10^(-4.5)) *10^0.3 )= log(10^(-4.2)) )= -4.2.

The solar [Si/H] is log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) = [Si/H]_sun = log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) = ?

Wait, since the Sun's [Fe/Mg] is such that nFe_sun/nMg_sun= (10^(-4.5))/(10^(-5)) )= 2. So, [Fe/Mg]_sun= log(2)≈0.3.

But how does that help with Si?

Wait, perhaps I need to find [Si/H]_sun.

Wait, for the Sun:

nFe_sun/nH_sun=10^(-4.5).

nMg_sun/nH_sun=10^(-5).

We need nSi_sun/nH_sun. But without that, I can't compute [Si/H]_sun.

Wait, perhaps another approach.

Assume that the Sun's [Si/Fe] is zero. Wait, no, because [X/Y] is relative to the Sun. So, [Si/Fe]_sun =0 → log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) =0 → nSi_sun =nFe_sun.

So, nSi_sun =nFe_sun =10^(-4.5) *nH_sun.

Thus, [Si/H]_sun = log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) = log(10^(-4.5) *nH_sun /nH_sun )= log(10^(-4.5)) =-4.5.

So, [Si/H]_sun =-4.5.

Wait, that makes sense because if [Si/Fe]_sun is 0, then Si and Fe are equally abundant relative to each other, but their absolute abundances are the same as the Sun.

So, back to Star_1:

log(nSi_1/nH_1) = [Si/H]_1 + [Si/H]_sun.

Which is:

log(nSi_1/nH_1) = [Si/H]_1 + (-4.5).

But we have:

log(nSi_1/nH_1) =-4.2 → So,

[Si/H]_1 -4.5 =-4.2 → [Si/H]_1=0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

We can compute [Si/H]_2.

We have [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) =0.3 + [Mg/Si]_sun.

But [Mg/Si]_sun is log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) = log( (10^(-5) *nH_sun) / (nSi_sun) ). But nSi_sun=10^(-4.5) *nH_sun → so,

nMg_sun/nSi_sun = (10^(-5) *nH_sun) / (10^(-4.5) *nH_sun) )=10^(-0.5) = 0.316.

So, [Mg/Si]_sun = log(0.316) ≈-0.5.

Thus, log(nMg_2/nSi_2) =0.3 + (-0.5) =-0.2 → nMg_2/nSi_2=10^(-0.2) ≈0.631.

But we also know that [Mg/H]_2=0 → log(nMg_2/nH_2) = log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) → nMg_2= nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun) )=10^(-5) *nH_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun) )=10^(-5) *nH_2.

So,

nMg_2 =10^(-5) *nH_2.

And,

nMg_2 =0.631 *nSi_2 → 10^(-5) *nH_2 =0.631 *nSi_2 → nSi_2 = (10^(-5) *nH_2) / 0.631 → 10^(-5) /0.631 ≈1.585e-5 → 1.585e-5 =10^(-4.805).

So, nSi_2=10^(-5.805) *nH_2.

Wait, but how does this help with [Si/H]_2?

[Si/H]_2 = log(nSi_2/nH_2) - [Si/H]_sun.

Which is log(10^(-5.805) *nH_2 /nH_2 ) - (-4.5) → log(10^(-5.805)) +4.5 → (-5.805) +4.5 =-1.305.

So, [Si/H]_2 =-1.305.

So, now, for the two stars:

[Si/H]_1=0.3 → log(nSi_1/nH_1)= [Si/H]_1 + [Si/H]_sun =0.3 + (-4.5) =-4.2 → nSi_1=10^(-4.2)*nH_1.

[Si/H]_2=-1.305 → log(nSi_2/nH_2)= -1.305 + (-4.5) )= -5.805 → nSi_2=10^(-5.805)*nH_2.

Now, the ratio nSi_1/nSi_2 = [10^(-4.2) *nH_1 ] / [10^(-5.805) *nH_2 ]

= 10^(1.605) * (nH_1 /nH_2 ).

10^1.605 is approximately 40.17 → but wait, 10^1.6 is about 39.8, so 10^1.605 is around 40.17.

So, nSi_1/nSi_2 ≈40.17 * (nH_1/nH_2).

But again, I don't know the ratio of nH_1/nH_2.

Wait, but if the stars have the same metallicity as the Sun, then the mass of H would be proportional to the star's mass.

Because metallicity is the same, the mass fraction of H is the same as the Sun. So, the number of H atoms (nH) is (mass of H) / (mass of one H atom).

Assuming that the mass of H is proportional to the star's mass times the mass fraction of H.

If the Sun's mass is M_sun, and the mass fraction of H is X_sun, then the number of H atoms in the Sun is X_sun * M_sun / (mass of H atom).

For Star_1, mass M1=1.5 M_sun, same X_sun → nH_1 = X_sun * M1 / m_H = X_sun *1.5 M_sun/m_H.

Similarly, nH_2 = X_sun *1.2 M_sun/m_H.

So,

nH_1/nH_2 = (1.5)/(1.2) )=5/4=1.25.

Thus, nSi_1/nSi_2 ≈40.17 *1.25≈50.21.

But that's way higher than any option given. So, perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to ignore the nH_1 and nH_2, considering that the ratio would be based only on the abundances, assuming nH is the same for both stars.

So, if nH_1 =nH_2 → then nSi_1/nSi_2 =10^(1.605)≈40.17 → which isn't an option either.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [Si/H]_2.

Let me recheck.

For Star_2, [Mg/Si]=0.3.

We know that nMg_2 =10^(-5) *nH_2.

And, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) =0.3 + [Mg/Si]_sun.

Earlier, I calculated [Mg/Si]_sun as log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) → but nMg_sun =10^(-5) *nH_sun, and nSi_sun =10^(-4.5)*nH_sun.

So,

nMg_sun /nSi_sun = (10^(-5) *nH_sun )/(10^(-4.5)*nH_sun) )=10^(-0.5) → which is about 0.316.

So, [Mg/Si]_sun = log(0.316)= log(10^(-0.5)) )= -0.5.

Thus, for Star_2:

log(nMg_2/nSi_2) =0.3 + (-0.5) )= -0.2 → nMg_2/nSi_2 =10^(-0.2) ≈0.630.

So,

nMg_2 =0.630 *nSi_2.

But nMg_2 =10^(-5) *nH_2 → 10^(-5) nH_2 =0.630 *nSi_2 → nSi_2 = (10^(-5)/0.630 ) *nH_2 ≈1.587e-5 *nH_2 → which is 10^(-4.805) *nH_2.

So, [Si/H]_2= log(nSi_2/nH_2) - [Si/H]_sun.

nSi_2/nH_2=1.587e-5 → log(1.587e-5 )= log(1.587) + log(1e-5) )=0.2 -5= -4.8.

[Si/H]_sun is -4.5.

So, [Si/H]_2= (-4.8 ) - (-4.5) )= -0.3.

Wait, wait, no. The formula is [X/H] = log(nX/nH) - log(nX_sun/nH_sun).

So, [Si/H]_2 = log(nSi_2/nH_2) - [Si/H]_sun.

Which is log(1.587e-5 ) - (-4.5) ?

Wait, [Si/H]_sun is log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) = log(10^(-4.5) )= -4.5.

So,

[Si/H]_2 = log(nSi_2/nH_2 ) - (-4.5) )= log(1.587e-5 ) +4.5.

log(1.587e-5 )= log(1.587) + log(1e-5 )=0.2 -5= -4.8.

So,

[Si/H]_2= -4.8 +4.5= -0.3.

So, that would make [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

So, for Star_1, [Si/H]=0.3.

Thus, the ratio of [nSi_1/nH_1] / [nSi_2/nH_2] )=10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 }.

Which is 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)}=10^0.6≈3.98≈4.

But wait, nSi_1/nH_1 is proportional to 10^{0.3} and nSi_2/nH_2 is proportional to10^{-0.3}.

So, the ratio (nSi_1/nH_1 ) / (nSi_2/nH_2 )=10^{0.6}≈3.98.

But the question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, it's nSi_1/nSi_2.

But nSi_1/nSi_2 = (nSi_1/nH_1) * (nH_1/nH_2 ) * (nH_2/nSi_2).

Wait, not exactly. Let me think: nSi_1/nSi_2 = (nSi_1/nH_1) * (nH_1/nH_2 ) * (nH_2/nSi_2 )^{-1}.

Wait, no, perhaps:

nSi_1 = (nSi_1/nH_1) *nH_1.

nSi_2 = (nSi_2/nH_2) *nH_2.

So,

nSi_1/nSi_2 = (nSi_1/nH_1) * (nH_1/nH_2 ) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ).

= [10^{ [Si/H]_1 } ] * (nH_1/nH_2 ) / [10^{ [Si/H]_2 } ].

=10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 } * (nH_1/nH_2 ).

Which would be 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)}=10^0.6≈3.98.

But that's only if nH_1/nH_2 is 1. If not, then the ratio is multiplied by nH_1/nH_2.

But earlier, I thought that assuming the number of H atoms scales with the star's mass, which would make nH_1/nH_2=1.5/1.2=1.25.

So, the total ratio would be 3.98 *1.25≈4.98, which is around 5, but that's not an option either.

Hmm, the options are A) ~3.9, B) ~12.6, etc. So, 3.98 is close to option A.

But where did I get this 3.98? Oh, because the [Si/H]_1 is 0.3 and [Si/H]_2 is -0.3.

So, the ratio (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2 )=10^(0.3 - (-0.3))=10^0.6≈3.98.

But that's only considering the [Si/H] ratios. If the ratio of nH_1/nH_2 is 1, then nSi_1/nSi_2=3.98.

But if nH_1/nH_2 is 1.25, then the ratio would be 3.98 *1.25≈5.

But the options don't include that. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I'm not supposed to consider nH_1 and nH_2, and the ratio is simply based on the [Si/H] abundances.

Because, after all, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres, which would be (nSi_1 /nH_1) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) ) * (nH_1/nH_2 ), which is (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) ) * (nH_1/nH_2) ).

But that can't be right. Wait, no, nSi_1/nSi_2 = (nSi_1/nH_1) * (nH_1/nH_2) / (nSi_2/nH_2).

So, the ratio is 10^{ [Si/H]_1 } * (nH_1/nH_2 ) / (10^{ [Si/H]_2 } ).

= 10^{0.3} * (nH_1/nH_2 ) / (10^{-0.3} )

= 10^{0.6} * (nH_1/nH_2 ).

Which is same as before.

So, unless the problem assumes that nH_1 =nH_2, which would give the ratio ≈3.98, which is option A.

But why would nH_1 =nH_2? Because their masses are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the ratio is [Si/Fe]_1 / [Si/Fe]_2, but I don't have [Si/Fe]_2.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me summarize:

- For Star_1, [Si/Fe]=0.3 and [Fe/H]=0 → so [Si/H]=0.3.

- For Star_2, [Mg/Si]=0.3 and [Mg/H]=0. So, [Mg/H]=0 → [Mg/Fe]=0 because [Fe/H]=0. So, for Star_2, [Mg/Fe]=0 → nMg_2/nFe_2 =nMg_sun/nFe_sun= (1e-5)/(1e-4.5) )= 0.316.

But [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2 )=0.3 + [Mg/Si]_sun.

We found that [Mg/Si]_sun is -0.5, so log(nMg_2/nSi_2 )= -0.2 → nMg_2/nSi_2=0.63.

But nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun) )=1e-5 *nH_2.

nFe_2 =nFe_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun) )=1e-4.5 *nH_2.

So, nMg_2= nSi_2 *0.63 → 1e-5 nH_2 =0.63 nSi_2 → nSi_2= (1e-5 /0.63) nH_2 ≈1.587e-5 nH_2.

So, [Si/H]_2= log(1.587e-5 ) - [Si/H]_sun.

Wait, [Si/H]_sun is -4.5, so:

[Si/H]_2= log(1.587e-5 ) +4.5.

log(1.587e-5 )= log(1.587) + log(1e-5 )=0.2 -5= -4.8.

So, [Si/H]_2= -4.8 +4.5= -0.3.

So, for nSi_1/nSi_2:

nSi_1/nH_1 =10^{ [Si/H]_1 }=10^{0.3} →≈2.

nSi_2/nH_2 =10^{ [Si/H]_2 }=10^{-0.3} →≈0.5.

So, the ratio (nSi_1/nH_1 ) / (nSi_2/nH_2 )= (2)/(0.5 )=4.

But that's under the assumption that nH_1 =nH_2. Which would make the ratio 4, close to option A (~3.9).

But why would nH_1 =nH_2? Because the stars have different masses, but perhaps the problem expects this assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the [Si/H] ratios, ignoring the H variations, leading to a ratio of 10^{0.6}=3.98.

Thus, the correct answer would be option A, ~3.9.

I think that's the intended path, as the other options don't fit with the calculations I made.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and solar photospheric compositions. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Abundance Ratios and Definitions**:  
   - The notation [X/Y] represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of element X to Y relative to the Sun.  
   - For Star_1:  
     - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun).  
     - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(nFe_1/nH_1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun).  
   - For Star_2:  
     - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = 0.3 + log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun).  
     - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → log(nMg_2/nH_2) = log(nMg_sun/nH_sun).  

2. **Solar Photospheric Composition**:  
   - From the problem, 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5.  
   - Similarly, 12 + log(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5.  
   - The Sun's [Si/Fe] = 0 → nSi_sun = nFe_sun.  
   - Thus, log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) = -4.5.  

3. **Abundance Calculations for Star_1**:  
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun = 10^(-4.5).  
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 implies log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = 0.3 → nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^0.3.  
   - Substituting nFe_1 = 10^(-4.5) * nH_1, we get nSi_1 = 10^(-4.2) * nH_1.  

4. **Abundance Calculations for Star_2**:  
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 implies nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun = 10^(-5).  
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 implies log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = 0.3 + log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun).  
   - For the Sun, nMg_sun/nSi_sun = 10^(-5)/10^(-4.5) = 10^(-0.5) ≈ 0.316 → log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) = -0.5.  
   - Thus, log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = 0.3 - 0.5 = -0.2 → nMg_2/nSi_2 = 10^(-0.2) ≈ 0.631.  
   - Substituting nMg_2 = 10^(-5) * nH_2, we get nSi_2 = (10^(-5) * nH_2) / 0.631 ≈ 10^(-5.3) * nH_2.  

5. **Ratio of Silicon Atoms**:  
   - The ratio of silicon atoms is nSi_1/nSi_2 = (10^(-4.2) * nH_1) / (10^(-5.3) * nH_2).  
   - Simplifying, nSi_1/nSi_2 = 10^(1.1) * (nH_1/nH_2).  
   - Assuming the stars have the same metallicity as the Sun, the number of hydrogen atoms scales with the star's mass. Thus, nH_1/nH_2 = M_1/M_2 = 1.5/1.2 = 1.25.  
   - Substituting, nSi_1/nSi_2 = 10^(1.1) * 1.25 ≈ 12.589 * 1.25 ≈ 15.736.  

6. **Revisiting the Assumptions**:  
   - If the problem assumes nH_1 = nH_2 (equal hydrogen content), the ratio becomes nSi_1/nSi_2 = 10^(1.1) ≈ 12.589.  
   - However, the problem may instead ask for the ratio of silicon relative to hydrogen, which is nSi_1/nSi_2 = 10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2}.  
   - For Star_1, [Si/H]_1 = 0.3, and for Star_2, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.  
   - Thus, nSi_1/nSi_2 = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98.  

Given the options and the likely assumption that the problem focuses on the relative abundances without scaling by hydrogen content, the ratio of silicon atoms is approximately **3.9**.
