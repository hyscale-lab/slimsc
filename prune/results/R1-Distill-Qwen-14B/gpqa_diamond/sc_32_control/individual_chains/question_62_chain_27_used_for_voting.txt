Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct sequence of reagents needed to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the target molecule. The name sounds a bit complex, but I'll try to parse it. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, there's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a methyl group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. Additionally, the cyclohexane ring has a carbonyl group (aldehyde) attached at position 1 as well. Wait, no, maybe the aldehyde is part of the substituent. Hmm. Wait, maybe the structure is a cyclohexane ring where one carbon (position 1) has two substituents: a methyl group connected to a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group, and an aldehyde group.

Wait, no, perhaps it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a methyl group, which is connected to both a cyclohexyl (as in a cyclohexane ring) and a hydroxyl group. So the structure is like a cyclohexane ring where one CH2 is replaced by a CH group attached to another cyclohexane ring and a hydroxyl group. Also, this same position has an aldehyde group. Wait, maybe the substituent is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl) group. So the main chain is a cyclohexane ring, and on carbon 1, there's a -CH(OH-cyclohexyl) group, and an aldehyde. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached to both a cyclohexane ring and a hydroxyl group, and the main ring (cyclohexane) has a carbonyl group (aldehyde) at position 1.

Wait, let me think again. The compound is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the core is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group at position 1. Then, the substituent at position 1 is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group. So, it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1 which is a methyl group attached to -OH and cyclohexyl. So the structure is:

The main ring is cyclohexane. At position 1, the carbon has a CH2 group (or CH?) with substituents. Wait, no, the substituent is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group. So it's a CH group (since it's methyl) attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So the structure is:

The main ring is cyclohexane. At position 1, there's a -CH(OH-cyclohexyl) group, and also a -CHO group. Wait, that can't be right because position 1 can't have two substituents if it's a cyclohexane ring. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the cyclohexane ring, which also has a carbonyl group (aldehyde) at position 1. Hmm, that seems like it's possible. So perhaps the molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1 being a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group and an aldehyde group. Wait, that doesn't make sense because position 1 is a single carbon. Oh wait, no, maybe the substituent is a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, and the aldehyde is also on the same carbon. So the structure would be a cyclohexane with a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)CHO group attached at position 1. So the carbon at position 1 has three substituents: two from the cyclohexane ring (maybe as a bridge?), but that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring where carbon 1 has a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) substituent, and another substituent which is the aldehyde group (-CHO).

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think about the starting material first: ethynylcyclohexane. That's cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (-C≡CH) attached. So the structure is cyclohexane with a triple bond to a CH2 group. So, like:

cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡C-H. So ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡C-H group attached. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so the cyclohexane has a -C≡CH substituent. So it's:

cyclohexane-C≡CH.

Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡C-H. So ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a triple bond; perhaps it's cyclohexane with a substituent of -C≡CH. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, ethynyl is directly attached. So it's cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group.

Now, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's imagine the target has a cyclohexane ring, and at position 1, there's a substituent which is a methyl group attached to a hydroxy group and a cyclohexyl group. Additionally, that same position has an aldehyde group. Wait, perhaps it's a geminal diol situation, but that's after some oxidation. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the target is a cyclohexane ring where the carbon at position 1 is connected to an aldehyde group and a -CH(OH-cyclohexyl) group. So the structure would be:

cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1 being a CH(OH- cyclohexyl) group and a CHO group. But wait, that would imply that the same carbon has a -CHO and a CH(OH- cyclohexyl), which would mean that carbon has four bonds: two from the cyclohexane (as CH2?), but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1 which is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group, and the same carbon has an aldehyde group. So maybe it's a cyclohexane ring where position 1 has a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)-CHO group. Wait, but that would require a carbon with four bonds: two from the ring (maybe as a bridge?), but I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the target structure is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1, which is a methyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group, and that same carbon is attached to an aldehyde. So the substituent would be CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)CHO. Hmm, but that would require a carbon with four substituents: cyclohexane ring, OH, cyclohexyl, and CHO. But that's four bonds, so that's possible if it's a quaternary carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH group with a hydroxyl and cyclohexyl group, and the aldehyde is part of the same substituent. Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, and the same substituent also has an aldehyde. So, the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)CHO. That would imply a longer chain.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the synthesis steps. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, so cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane with a -C≡C- group. Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so the structure is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group.

So, the plan is to go from ethynylcyclohexane to the target.

The target has an aldehyde group, so I'll need to consider oxidation steps, perhaps.

Looking at the options, each has a sequence of reagents. Let's think about what each reagent does.

Option A: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, option A has two steps 3? That looks like a typo. Maybe it's a typo, but I'll proceed.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; H2/Pd; O3/H2O; NH4OH.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; O3/(CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/liquid NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Hmm. Let's think about each step.

First, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let's think what each reagent does.

NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. Methyl chloride is a methylating agent. So step 1 in options A and C could be alkylation. Maybe adding a methyl group.

H2/Pd is hydrogenation, so reducing triple bonds to single bonds. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base used for elimination reactions, like in the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? Or for epoxide ring opening? Or perhaps for elimination of water, like in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones.

Wait, H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O: that sounds like the oxidation conditions for a primary alcohol to a carboxylic acid, but HgSO4 is used in the Jones oxidation (CrO3 in H2SO4 for secondary alcohols to ketones, but in Jones it's for oxidation of alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids, depending on the starting point.

Wait, another thought: the target has an aldehyde group. So perhaps the starting ethynylcyclohexane undergoes some reactions to form a ketone, which is then oxidized to aldehyde. Or maybe it's a Grignard reaction, or some kind of alkyne functionalization.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group needs to be converted into a carbonyl group. Because ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. To get an aldehyde, maybe we can perform a hydration of the alkyne.

Hydration of an alkyne can be done in acidic or basic conditions. For example, HgSO4 and H2SO4 in H2O (hydration) would convert an alkyne into a ketone if it's internal, but for terminal alkynes, it would give a ketone? Wait, no. Wait, terminal alkynes on hydration with HgSO4 and H2SO4 (Mercuric sulfate in sulfuric acid) in aqueous conditions give carboxylic acids. Wait, no: wait, hydration of a terminal alkyne (like ethynyl) with HgSO4/H2SO4 and H2O would give a ketone. Wait, no, wait: I think I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think: the hydration of an alkyne can be done under acidic or basic conditions. For example, in the presence of HgSO4 and H2SO4, a terminal alkyne (like ethynyl) would be hydrated to form a ketone. Because the triple bond is at the end, so the hydration would add an O to each end, but perhaps the structure becomes a ketone.

Wait, wait, no: for a terminal alkyne (R-C≡CH), acid-catalyzed hydration would give a ketone (R-CO-CH3?), but wait, that's not correct because adding across the triple bond would give R-CH2-C-OH, but that's an aldehyde. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the reagents. Alternatively, there's another method. Let me think: the hydration of ethynylcyclohexane would produce cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Because the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and the CH group. So, if we have cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH, then under acidic conditions, the triple bond would be hydrated to form cyclohexane-CH2-CHO. Wait, no, the actual structure is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. So, on hydration, that would become cyclohexane with a -CH2-CHO group? No, wait, the triple bond is between the cyclohexane carbon and the alkyne. So, for ethynylcyclohexane, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so the structure is cyclohexane-C≡CH. So, upon hydration, perhaps it would become cyclohexane-C(OH)H-CH3? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is between two CH groups: like cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Then, hydration would give cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CHO? Or perhaps cyclohexane-CH2-CHO.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the mercury sulfate and sulfuric acid as a catalyst for hydration of alkynes to ketones. So, in that case, ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH) would upon hydration yield cyclohexane-C(O)OH. Wait, no, because that's a terminal alkyne. Wait, no, I'm getting myself confused. Let me get this straight.

The hydration of alkynes can be done in two ways. Acidic conditions (HgSO4, H2SO4, H2O) will typically lead to the formation of a ketone if the alkyne is internal. For a terminal alkyne (like R-C≡CH), the same conditions would actually add two H2O molecules to form a ketone. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think: the hydration of a terminal alkyne would give a ketone or an aldehyde? Wait, no. Wait, the hydration of a terminal alkyne (like HC≡C-R) would add water across the triple bond to form an aldehyde (R-CHO). But under acidic conditions, perhaps it forms a ketone? Or maybe another mechanism.

Alternatively, maybe using a different reagent for different products. For example, using H2O and HgSO4 under acidic conditions would lead to the formation of a ketone from an internal alkyne and a carboxylic acid from a terminal alkyne.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group (-C≡CH) on cyclohexane, when subjected to acid-catalyzed hydration (H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O), would form a ketone. But that doesn't seem right because the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and the CH group. So, the alkyne is CH2-C≡C-H? No, wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. So, when we add HgSO4 and H2SO4, H2O, the alkyne would undergo hydration to form a ketone. But in this case, the triple bond is between a CH2 group and a CH group. Wait, perhaps the alkyne is in a position where hydration would yield a ketone.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on this. Let me think about the options again. Each option has a sequence of reagents. Let's see what the target requires.

The target has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group. Also, there's a substituent that's a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group. So, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane needs to undergo some alkyne modification to add that substituent and form the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve adding a group to the cyclohexane, then oxidizing to form the aldehyde.

Let me consider each option's steps.

Option A:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: This is likely a deprotonation followed by alkylation. NaNH2 is a strong base, maybe deprotonating a position to allow alkylation with methyl chloride. So, adding a methyl group somewhere.
2. H2/Pd: Hydrogenation, probably reducing a triple bond to a single bond.
3. Ba(OH)2: Maybe elimination, forming a double bond or creating an epoxide.
Wait, but the target has an aldehyde group. So, perhaps step 3 is an elimination that forms a carbonyl.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is used in the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, which adds an oxygen to break a bond and form a ketone, but that's for ketones. Alternatively, in the presence of Ba(OH)2 and heat, maybe an elimination occurs. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's used for cleavage of ethers.

Alternatively, after hydrogenation, perhaps the structure has a double bond, which could undergo Baeyer-Villiger. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Option B:
1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride: Alkylation, adding an ethyl group.
2. H2/Pd: Hydrogenation, maybe reducing a triple bond.
3. O3/H2O: Ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds.
4. NH4OH: Work-up, maybe hydrolysis.

But the target has an aldehyde group. Ozonolysis of a double bond would typically form carbonyl groups. So if after step 2, there's a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. Then, in step 4, with NH4OH (which is a mild reducing agent), but I'm not sure how that would help.

Option C:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: Alkylation, adding a methyl group.
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: Hydrogenation, probably reducing a triple bond to a single bond.
3. O3/(CH3)2S: Ozonolysis followed by reductive work-up with (CH3)2S, which would give aldehydes or ketones without overoxidizing.
4. Ba(OH)2: Maybe oxidation or elimination.

Hmm.

Option D:
1. NaNH2, methanol: Methanol is a methylating agent. Maybe this is an alkylation, but with methanol? Or perhaps it's a Grignard-like reaction, but I'm not sure.
2. Li/liq. NH3: This is a strong base, used for deprotonation, maybe for elimination or for forming enolates.
3. O3/(CH3)2S: Ozonolysis and reductive work-up.
4. NH4OH: Again, perhaps a hydrolysis step.

Wait, let me think again about the target. The target has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl substituent. So, perhaps the starting alkyne is first alkylated to add a substituent, then reduced, then some oxidation or cleavage occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is first functionalized. Let's think about the steps.

Step 1 in options A, C, and D is NaNH2 with methyl chloride or methanol.

NaNH2 is a strong base. In the presence of methyl chloride, it's an alkylation. So the base deprotonates a compound, and methyl chloride acts as an electrophile.

If the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a relatively acidic compound because sp-hybridized carbons are more acidic. The protons on the triple bond (the alkyne) are more acidic, pKa around 25. So NaNH2 would deprotonate the alkyne, generating an acetylide ion.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, and ethynylcyclohexane's alkyne protons are acidic enough to be deprotonated. So step 1 in options A, C, and D (where NaNH2 is used) would form the acetylide.

Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate the acetylide. So the acetylide (a strong base) would attack the methyl chloride, adding a methyl group to the alkyne.

So after step 1, the product would be (cyclohexyl)acetylide with a methyl group added. So the structure would be cyclohexane attached to a -C≡C-CH3 group. Wait, no: ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or cyclohexane-C≡CH? Hmm, perhaps I got that wrong. Let me clarify: the structure of ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with a -C≡CH group attached. So, when deprotonated, the acetylide would be cyclohexane-C≡C⁻ . Then, adding methyl chloride would add a methyl group to the acetylide: cyclohexane-C≡C-Me. So the product would be cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

Wait, but wait: the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane-C≡CH. Deprotonation gives cyclohexane-C≡C⁻. Alkylation with methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would add a methyl group to the acetylide, giving cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3, which is 1-propynylcyclohexane perhaps? Or maybe it's a longer chain.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: ethynylcyclohexane is CH2CH2... no, wait, no. Ethynylcyclohexane would have a cyclohexane ring with a -C≡C-H group. So the structure is cyclohexane-C≡CH. Deprotonating the terminal H (pKa ~25) with NaNH2 gives cyclohexane-C≡C⁻ Na+.

Then, adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate the acetylide, giving cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. So the product after step 1 would be cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

Next, step 2 in option C is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is hydrogenation. H2 and Pd would reduce the triple bond. So the alkyne becomes an alkane. So cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3 upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no: hydrogenation of a triple bond to single bond would add two H2 molecules. So cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3 → cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and a catalyst (like Lindlar's for cis addition, or normal for trans) would give an alkane. So the triple bond becomes a single bond with two additional H's.

Wait, no: the hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and a catalyst (like palladium) typically reduces the triple bond to a single bond with the addition of two H's. So, the product would be an alkane. So cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3 → cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and the CH3 group. So the structure is cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. Hydrogenation would add two H2 molecules, converting the triple bond to single, so the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that would be a three-carbon chain attached to the cyclohexane. So now, the molecule is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Hmm, but the target has a cyclohexyl group attached. Maybe I'm on the wrong track. Alternatively, perhaps after hydrogenation, there's a double bond, but no, hydrogenation of a triple bond would remove the triple bond and make a single bond.

Wait, let me think again. So after step 1 and 2 in option C, the product is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Then step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S. Ozonolysis would break double bonds, but in this case, the molecule is a single bond between CH2 and CH2. So ozonolysis wouldn't do anything because there's no double bond. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe step 2 in option C isn't hydrogenation but something else. Wait, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 1, the product is a longer alkyne, and hydrogenation would turn it into an alkene? No, because hydrogenation of alkynes typically gives alkanes.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not on the right track. Let me consider another approach. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexane ring, an aldehyde group, and a substituent with a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxyl group, and a methyl group.

So, perhaps the synthesis involves adding a substituent to the cyclohexane, then oxidizing it to form the aldehyde and introduce the hydroxyl group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a ketone, then functionalized.

Wait, perhaps the steps are: alkylate the alkyne, then hydrogenate it to form a substituted cyclohexane with a substituent, then perform some oxidation or ozonolysis to form the aldehyde and the necessary groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group. For example, hydration of the alkyne to form a ketone or aldehyde, then undergo further functionalization.

Wait, let's think about each option's steps.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol: So, deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, then perhaps quench with methanol. Methanol is a nucleophile, so perhaps the acetylide would react with methanol to form a new carbon-carbon bond. So, cyclohexane-C≡CH → (after deprotonation) cyclohexane-C≡C⁻ → which would react with methanol to form cyclohexane-C≡C-OCH3? Wait, but methanol is a weak nucleophile. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is alkylation, but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe NaNH2 and methanol would cause some kind of elimination or substitution. Hmm, I'm not sure about this step.

Option B's steps:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride: So, form the acetylide, then add ethyl chloride to alkylate, giving a longer alkyne.
2. H2/Pd: Reduce the alkyne to an alkene or an alkane. If an internal alkyne, hydrogenation would give an alkane. If a terminal alkyne, maybe it would give an alkene with cis or trans addition.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck again. Let me think of the target's substituents.

The substituent is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group. So, perhaps that group is formed via some kind of addition or substitution.

Wait, perhaps I should think about using the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction, but that's for adding halogens to alpha positions of carboxylic acids, which doesn't seem relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the target's substituent involves an epoxide ring-opening, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into an aldehyde. Then, the aldehyde is used in some kind of alkylation or addition to form the (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane after hydration would form cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (if the alkyne is at the end). So, perhaps step 1 is hydration of the alkyne to form an aldehyde. Then, subsequent steps would add the substituent.

Wait, looking at the options, none of them have HgSO4, H2SO4, H2O as the first step. So perhaps the alkyne is first alkylated, then reduced, then oxidized, etc.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option's reagents in the context of the target.

Option C: Steps 1-4 are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation, adds methyl group to alkyne.
2. H2/Pd → reduces alkyne to alkane.
3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds, but in this case, after hydrogenation, the product is an alkane, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 2, the molecule has a double bond, meaning that step 2 might not be hydrogenation but something else. Wait, step 2 in option C is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is definitely hydrogenation. So that would reduce any triple bonds to single bonds, but if the alkyne is converted into a longer chain, maybe the hydrogenation creates a double bond? No, hydrogenation adds H2 across triple bonds to make single bonds, so the product would be an alkane.

Hmm. Maybe I'm on the wrong track. Let me consider the target again. The target has an aldehyde group. So perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via some reaction.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a cyclohexenyl group, then undergoes some addition to form the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol, but that's more via oxymercuration or other methods.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence involves the following:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to add a substituent.
2. Reduction of the alkyne to form a diol or an alcohol.
3. Oxidation to form a carbonyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about the target's substituent: cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the aldehyde. So, perhaps the substituent comes from some kind of cyclopropane opening or ring expansion, but that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is first alkylated to form a longer alkyne, then reduced to form an alkane with a substituent, then oxidized to form the aldehyde and the hydroxyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve adding a hydroxyl group via oxidation.

Wait, another thought: The target's substituent has a hydroxyl group, which suggests that perhaps an epoxide was opened. Or maybe some kind of dihydroxylation followed by elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve a Grignard reaction, but I don't see Mg in any of the reagents, so that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the correct pathway is:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to add a methyl group, making it a longer alkyne.
2. Reduce the alkyne to a cis-alkene (using H2 and Lindlar's catalyst), but the options don't have Lindlar's.
3. Perform ozonolysis on the alkene to form carbonyl groups.
4. Work up to form the aldehyde and the hydroxyl group.

Looking at option C, which has ozonolysis (O3) and (CH3)2S as the work-up. Using (CH3)2S as a reductant in ozonolysis would give aldehydes or ketones without further oxidation. So after ozonolysis, you get carbonyl groups.

So, let me walk through option C's steps:

Starting material: ethynylcyclohexane → cyclohexane-C≡CH.

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → deprotonate to form acetylide, then methyl chloride adds a methyl group → cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → reduce the triple bond to single bond → cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's just a propane chain attached to cyclohexane. How does that lead to the target?

But the target has a cyclohexyl group attached, so perhaps I'm missing a ring-forming step.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about step 2. Let me think: if step 2 is H2/Pd, it reduces the triple bond to a single bond, so cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3 becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that doesn't introduce any rings. Hmm.

Wait, maybe step 2 is not hydrogenation but something else. Oh, no, H2/Pd is definitely hydrogenation, so it's adding H2 across the triple bond.

Then step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S. Ozonolysis of an alkane? No, ozonolysis cleaves double bonds. So after step 2, there's a single bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Hmm. Let me think about option D.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → alkylate the alkyne with methanol. Wait, methanol is a methylating agent, but doesn't have a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide reacts with methanol to form a ketone or some other product. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, maybe methanol isn't the methylating agent here. Alternatively, perhaps it's a quench step. So after deprotonation with NaNH2, adding methanol would protonate the acetylide, giving a product. But that might not add any substituents. So perhaps step 1 in D doesn't add anything, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps NaNH2 and methanol serve to add a hydroxymethyl group. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Step 2 in D is Li/liq. NH3. That's a strong base, often used in deprotonation or elimination reactions. For example, it can deprotonate alcohols to form alkoxide ions, which can then react in alkylation or elimination.

Step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S. Ozonolysis again.

Step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild acid and might be used for work-up, perhaps hydrolysis.

But I'm not sure how this sequence would build the target molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C. Let's try to think again.

After step 1: cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Then step 3: O3/(CH3)2S. But after step 2, it's an alkane, so ozonolysis won't act. Therefore, this can't be right.

Hmm. Maybe I'm stuck on the wrong pathway. Let me think about the target's substituent and how that might form.

The substituent is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group. So, perhaps a cyclohexyl group is added via some kind of alkylation or coupling reaction.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a ketone via hydration, then subjected to some alkylation, then reduced, then oxidized.

Wait, but the options don't have a step with HgSO4 and H2SO4 as the first step. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is first alkylated to form a di-substituted alkyne, then reduced to a diol, then oxidized to form a ketone, which is then further oxidized or functionalized.

Wait, but how would that lead to the substituent in the target? I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is formed via a Grignard reaction, but again, none of the steps involve Mg.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is A. Let's try that.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → adds a methyl group to the alkyne, making it a longer alkyne.
2. H2/Pd → reduces the alkyne to an alkane.
3. Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination or oxidation.
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → oxidation.

So, step 1: ethynylcyclohexane → after alkylation becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → reduces to cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2. I'm not sure what this does to an alkane. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe causing elimination, but without adjacent H's, elimination is unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of an alcohol to a ketone, but I don't see any alcohol in the product after step 2. Hmm.

Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → Jones oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids and secondary to ketones. But if step 3 doesn't produce an alcohol, this step wouldn't do anything.

Hmm. Maybe I'm not seeing the right pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps the target's substituent is formed via a ring-opening of an epoxide. But that would require an epoxide, which I'm not sure how to form.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a cyclopropane ring, but that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent comes from a cyclohexane ring that's added via some kind of coupling.

Wait, perhaps the target substituent is formed via a substitution reaction. For instance, if after some steps, a leaving group is added, which is then replaced by a hydroxyl and cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not getting anywhere, so perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Another idea: the target has a substituent (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which can be formed via a nucleophilic substitution. So perhaps an epoxide is formed, which is then opened by a cyclohexanol to introduce the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups.

But I'm not sure how to get to that point.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to add a methyl group, making it longer.
2. Reduce the alkyne to an alkene.
3. Ozonolyze the alkene to form carbonyl groups.
4. Perform some work-up to form the hydroxyl group.

Looking at the options, option C's steps include ozonolysis after hydrogenation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the hydrogenation step. Maybe the alkyne is first converted into a di-substituted alkyne, which upon hydrogenation gives a trans-alkene. Then ozonolysis would break that into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but in option C, after step 2, the product is an alkane, and ozonolysis won't act on that.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexyl group, which suggests that another cyclohexane ring is attached. So perhaps the substituent is formed via some kind of alkylation where a cyclohexyl group is added.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's typically for aromatic rings, and the starting material is a cyclohexane, which is not aromatic.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a nucleophilic attack, but I'm not seeing the pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent comes from a diol that's oxidized to form a carbonyl, but that doesn't fit with the steps in the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me try to think through all the steps for option C.

Option C:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride → alkylate the alkyne, adding a methyl group. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → reduce the triple bond to a single bond. So, cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3 becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis. But in this structure, there's no double bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in step 2. If step 2 isn't hydrogenation, perhaps it's a different reaction. But the reagents say H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is definitely hydrogenation.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the target as having two substituents: an aldehyde and a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group. So, perhaps the aldehyde comes from the alkyne, and the substituent comes from another part.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is first converted into a cyclohexane with a ketone group, then subjected to some alkylation to add the substituent.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a carbonyl group via hydration, then the carbonyl is used in a nucleophilic addition to introduce the substituent.

So, step 1: HgSO4, H2SO4, H2O → hydration of the alkyne to form a ketone. But none of the options have this as the first step.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should think about the answer based on the number of steps and the reagents.

The target has an aldehyde group, which suggests some oxidation. Looking at the options, options B, C, and D have ozonolysis steps, which can produce carbonyl groups.

Option D's steps include ozonolysis and then NH4OH, which could be a work-up for aldehyde formation.

Option C's step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which could be an oxidation step.

But I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should think of each option's possible outcome.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps forms the acetylide, but without a methylating agent, maybe it's a quench step, giving back the starting material. Not sure.

2. Li/liq. NH3 → strong base, maybe for elimination.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis, which breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → hydrolysis, perhaps.

If the molecule after step 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. But how would the starting material get a double bond?

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is formed, then quenched with a Grignard reagent, but that's not in the steps.

I'm not making progress, so perhaps it's time to try to find the correct answer.

Wait, another thought: the target has a substituent with a cyclohexyl group, which suggests that a ring-opening or a coupling reaction might be involved. But without seeing the steps, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to add a methyl group (NaNH2, CH3Cl)
2. Reduce the alkyne to an alkene (H2/Pd)
3. Ozonolyze the alkene to form carbonyl groups (O3, (CH3)2S)
4. Oxidize to form the aldehyde and introduce the hydroxyl group (Ba(OH)2 or other oxidizing agents)

Looking at option C, step 3 is ozonolysis, but after step 2, the product is an alkane, so ozonolysis wouldn't act. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken about step 2 in option C. Maybe step 2 is not hydrogenation but something else. Oh wait, no, the reagents are H2/Pd, which is hydrogenation.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe the correct answer is option C.

Wait, let me think of the target again. It has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group and an aldehyde group. So, perhaps the substituent is formed via a substitution reaction where the cyclohexyl and hydroxyl groups are added.

Wait, perhaps the substituent comes from a diol that's oxidized. But without a diol in the steps, I'm not sure.

Another idea: perhaps the substituent is formed via a ring-opening of an epoxide. But again, without an epoxide, this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a conjugate addition to a carbonyl group.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Let me look for the correct option.

Looking at option C's steps:

1. Alkylation → adds methyl to alkyne.
2. Hydrogenation → converts triple to single bond.
3. Ozonolysis → nothing, since no double bond.
4. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps oxidation.

Hmm, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → forms acetylide.
2. Li/liq. NH3 → strong base, perhaps for elimination.
3. Ozonolysis → cleaves double bonds to form carbonyls.
4. NH4OH → hydrolysis.

But how does this lead to the substituent?

Wait, perhaps after step 2, a double bond is formed via elimination. Then, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

But I'm not seeing how that leads to the target structure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 in D is a Birch reduction, but I don't think so. Li in liquid NH3 is used for reductions, like the Birch reduction, which reduces aromatic rings, but the starting material isn't aromatic.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Looking at the target, the substituent has a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group attached to a methyl, which suggests that perhaps an epoxide is opened by a cyclohexanol. But how is the epoxide formed?

Wait, perhaps after adding a substituent via alkylation, an epoxide is formed via oxidation, then opened by a nucleophile. But without seeing the steps, it's hard.

Alternatively, considering that the target has an aldehyde group, perhaps the correct option is C, because it includes ozonolysis, which can form aldehyde groups.

Wait, after alkylation and hydrogenation, perhaps the molecule has a double bond again, which would be cleaved by ozonolysis.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in thinking that step 2 in C is hydrogenation. Maybe it's not. Let me check the steps again.

Option C: step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. That's definitely hydrogenation. So if after step 1, we have an alkyne, step 2 would reduce it to an alkane.

So, perhaps the correct option is D.

But I'm really stuck. I think I'll have to go with option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, the analysis of the options involves evaluating the sequence of reagents and their potential to transform the starting material into the target molecule. The target molecule contains a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and a substituent at position 1, which is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group. This suggests the need for functionalization of the alkyne, reduction, and subsequent reactions to introduce the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups.

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which reacts with methyl chloride to alkylate the alkyne, yielding cyclohexane-C≡C-CH₃.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Reduces the alkyne to a single bond, forming cyclohexane-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, potentially for elimination or oxidation, but its role here is unclear.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Jones oxidation, which oxidizes alcohols or alkanes, but no alcohol is present after step 2. This sequence does not clearly lead to the target molecule.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Alkylates the alkyne, forming a longer alkyne.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Reduces the alkyne to an alkane.
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, but no double bond is present after step 2.
4. **NH₄OH**: Hydrolysis, but the sequence does not explain how the hydroxyl or cyclohexyl groups are introduced.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Alkylates the alkyne, yielding cyclohexane-C≡C-CH₃.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, forming cyclohexane-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds, but no double bond is present after step 2. This step does not contribute meaningfully to the synthesis.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for oxidation or elimination, but its role in forming the target molecule is unclear.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne, but methanol is not a strong methylating agent, and its role here is ambiguous.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or deprotonation, but its exact function is unclear.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, but no double bond is present after step 2.
4. **NH₄OH**: Hydrolysis, but the sequence does not explain how the hydroxyl or cyclohexyl groups are introduced.

### Conclusion:
The target molecule requires the introduction of a hydroxyl group, a cyclohexyl group, and an aldehyde group. None of the options clearly provide a pathway to achieve this. However, based on the analysis, **Option C** is the most plausible, as it includes steps that could potentially lead to the formation of the aldehyde group via ozonolysis, even though the sequence is not entirely clear.
