Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. I remember that the transit method relies on the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact factors that influence the probability of such an event.

The question gives me two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same minimum mass, detected via the radial velocity method. Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3. Also, both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things a bit.

The stars are different. The host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host, but both stars have the same radius. Hmm, same radius but different masses. Since more massive stars are usually larger, but in this case, the higher mass star has the same radius as the lower mass one. So maybe it's a subgiant or something, but not sure if that matters here.

I think the transit probability depends on a few factors. I remember that the probability increases with the size of the planet relative to the star and with the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. Oh, and the orbital period must be such that the planet transits in front of the star as seen from Earth.

Wait, another factor is the inclination of the orbit. For a transit to happen, the planet's orbital plane must be edge-on relative to us. The probability of that is higher when the star's mass is lower, I think. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, I think it's more about the planet's orbital distance and the star's size.

Wait, the probability of transit can be approximated by the formula: P = (R_p / a) * (1 / sin i), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is higher when the planet's orbital distance is smaller because the star's size is a larger fraction of the distance. So the planet is more likely to cross our line of sight.

Wait, let me think again. The transit probability (the chance that the planet transits as seen from Earth) is given by (R_star / a) * (1 / sin i), where i is the inclination. But since both planets are detected via RV, we know their minimum masses, but the inclination isn't precisely known. However, for the purpose of calculating probabilities, I think we assume a random distribution, so the probability depends on the alignment.

Wait, no, I think the probability of a transit is roughly given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, but R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so it's approximately R_star / a. Because the planet needs to be within a certain distance from the line of sight for the transit to occur. So the closer the planet is to us (smaller a), the higher the probability that it transits.

Wait, that makes sense. Because when a is small, the star's disk is a larger fraction of the planet's orbit, making it more likely that the planet's path intersects our line of sight.

So, P_transit ~ R_star / a.

But wait, a is the semi-major axis. How do we relate that to the orbital period? Using Kepler's third law. The formula is a^3 = (G (M_star + M_planet) * P^2) / (4π²). But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

So a ≈ ( ( G M_star P^2 ) / (4 π² ) )^(1/3)

Alternatively, for a star of mass M, the semi-major axis a is proportional to (P^2 * M)^(1/3).

Wait, so a is proportional to (M * P²)^(1/3).

But wait, in our case, the two planets have different periods and different host star masses. Let me compute a for each planet.

Planet_1: P1 = P/3 (since its period is three times shorter than Planet_2's). Host star mass M1 = 2 M2, where M2 is the mass of Planet_2's host.

So, for Planet_1:

a1 ~ ( M1 * P1² )^(1/3) = (2 M2 * (P/3)^2 )^(1/3) = (2 M2 * P² /9 )^(1/3) = ( (2/9) M2 P² )^(1/3 )

For Planet_2:

a2 ~ ( M2 * P² )^(1/3)

So, let's compute the ratio a1/a2.

a1/a2 = [ (2/9) M2 P² )^(1/3) ] / [ (M2 P² )^(1/3) ) ]

Which simplifies to (2/9)^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(0.333) ≈ 0.607.

Wait, let me compute 2/9 = 0.2222... The cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.607. So a1 is about 0.607 times a2. So a1 is smaller than a2, which makes sense because Planet_1 has a shorter period and more massive star.

Wait, but how does a relate to the transit probability? Earlier, I thought the transit probability is proportional to R_star / a. So for each planet, the transit probability is (R_star / a). But both stars have the same radius, R.

So P1 = R / a1, P2 = R / a2.

So the ratio P1/P2 = (R/a1)/(R/a2) ) = a2/a1 ≈ 1/0.607 ≈ 1.647.

So the probability for Planet_1 is about 1.647 times higher than that of Planet_2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability, so the researchers should observe Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. That matches.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula.

Another way: the transit probability is P = (R_star / a) * (something else?).

Wait, I think the probability also depends on the impact parameter. But I think for a randomly oriented orbit, the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned so that it transits is given by (R_star / a) * (1 / sin i), but when considering a random distribution of inclinations, the probability is (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(1/2)), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), it's (R_star / a) * (1 / 1 ) = R_star / a.

But wait, no, I think that's not quite right. Wait, the actual formula for the probability that a planet transits is (R_star + R_planet)/a * (1 / (1 + (b^2)) ), where b is the impact parameter, but I think for random orientations, the probability is the product of the geometric probability and the aligment probability.

Wait, maybe I should refer to the standard transit probability formula. I think the transit probability for an edge-on orbit is higher when the planet is closer to the star, as that makes the transit more likely.

Another approach: The transit probability is given by (R_s / a) * (1 / sin i), but considering a random inclination, the average probability is (R_s / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²)) ), but since e=0, it's (R_s / a).

Wait, but more accurately, the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that the transit occurs is (R_s / a) / (1 - (R_s / a)^2)^(1/2) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've read that the probability is approximately (R_s / a) when the star's radius is much smaller than a, but when a is much larger, the probability is lower.

Wait, perhaps it's correct that the probability is approximately (R_s / a) for edge-on orbits. So in this case, since Planet_1 has a smaller a, R_s / a is larger, so higher probability.

So with a1 = 0.607 a2, P1 = R / a1 ≈ 1/0.607 ≈ 1.647 times (R/a2), which is P2. So P1 is about 1.65 times P2. So Planet_1 is preferred.

Looking back at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred with ~1.65 times higher probability. That's correct.

Another way to check the math: a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2 ≈ (0.222)^(0.333) a2 ≈ 0.607 a2.

So R/a1 = R/(0.607 a2) ≈ 1.647 R/(a2) = 1.647 * (R/a2) = 1.647 * P2.

So yes, Planet_1's transit probability is about 1.65 times Planet_2's. So the correct choice is C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the factors influencing transit probability. The transit probability is approximately proportional to \( P_{\text{transit}} \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius, the key factor is the semi-major axis \( a \), which can be related to the orbital period \( P \) and the host star's mass \( M_{\text{star}} \) using Kepler's third law:

\[
a \propto \left( M_{\text{star}} P^2 \right)^{1/3}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute the semi-major axis ratio
For Planet_1:
\[
a_1 \propto \left( M_1 P_1^2 \right)^{1/3},
\]
where \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) and \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \). Substituting these values:
\[
a_1 \propto \left( 2M_2 \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} M_2 P_2^2 \right)^{1/3}.
\]

For Planet_2:
\[
a_2 \propto \left( M_2 P_2^2 \right)^{1/3}.
\]

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{\left( \frac{2}{9} M_2 P_2^2 \right)^{1/3}}{\left( M_2 P_2^2 \right)^{1/3}} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3}.
\]

Calculating \( \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3} \):
\[
\left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.607.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.607a_2 \).

### Step 2: Compute the transit probability ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \). Since both stars have the same radius, the ratio of the transit probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_1}}{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}.
\]

Substituting \( a_1 \approx 0.607a_2 \):
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{1}{0.607} \approx 1.65.
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion
Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

### Final Answer:
Answer: C
