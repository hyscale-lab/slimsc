Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Alright, it's about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and we need to find the relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, that's a bit tricky, but I'll take it slow.

First, let me read the question again carefully. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So, both are moving in the same direction. The options are about their relative speed (v_rel) and the total energy (E) of the system.

Wait, so the first part is about finding the relative speed between them. Since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed shouldn't be as straightforward as just subtracting their speeds because we're dealing with relativity here. Oh right, in relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. I remember the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula for relative velocity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), where u and v are the velocities of the two objects as observed from a common frame. But wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So, if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, which one is ahead? Actually, the problem doesn't specify their positions, just their speeds. So perhaps I should assume that we're calculating the relative speed of the slower astronaut as seen from the faster one's frame.

Wait, no. Let me think. The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is the difference of their speeds divided by (1 minus the product of their speeds over c²). So, the calculation would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Calculating the numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So, 0.1c divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.142857c. Rounded to two decimal places, that's 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. That matches one of the options, like option C and D.

Now the second part is the total energy of the system. Each astronaut is a relativistic object, so their energies would be their rest mass energy multiplied by gamma, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me compute each one's energy.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma for 0.6c: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.36c²)/c²) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1=2m * c² * gamma = 2m * c² * 1.25 = 2.5 m c².

Wait, wait, that's not right. Wait, the rest energy is mc², so the relativistic energy is gamma * mc². So for mass 2m, the energy would be gamma * (2m c²). Oh right, so:

E1 = gamma1 * (2 m c²)
E2 = gamma2 * (3 m c²)

So let's compute gamma1 and gamma2.

Gamma1: 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2)) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

Gamma2: 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2/c^2)) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E1 = 1.25 * 2 m c² = 2.5 m c².

E2 = 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.4641 m c².

Total energy E = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c². Hmm, looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches this. Option D says 5 mc², which is lower. So that's probably not the right option.

Wait, but another thought: when considering the system's total energy, do I need to account for their motion relative to each other in terms of frame of reference? Or do I just add their energies as observed in the same frame?

Because the question says "the total energy of the system." In relativity, energy depends on the frame. So I think the question is asking for the total energy in the same frame where their velocities are 0.6c and 0.5c. Let me assume that's the case. So the way I calculated earlier is correct.

So the total energy would be approximately 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C is v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². Option D has the same v_rel but E=5 mc², which is lower. So option C seems to fit both the relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, wait, but let's double-check the relative speed calculation. Let me re-calculate that. The formula for relative velocity u' when u and v are the velocities of two objects in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). So u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c.

u - v = 0.1c.

uv = 0.6c * 0.5c = 0.3 c².

So denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²) / c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c ≈ 0.14c. So yes, v_rel is 0.14c.

So the correct answer must have v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². Looking at the options, that's option C.

Wait, let me check the other options. Option B has v_rel=0.1c, which is the difference without considering relativity. So that's wrong. So option C is the right one.

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system based on the given data.

### Relative Speed Calculation
The two astronauts are moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds of \( 0.6c \) and \( 0.5c \). The relative speed \( v_{\text{rel}} \) is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy Calculation
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).

#### Energy of the first astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m c^2) = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of the second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5c)^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m c^2) = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \).
- The total energy is \( E \approx 5.96m c^2 \).

Comparing with the options, the correct choice is **C**.
