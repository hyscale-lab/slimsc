Okay, so I have this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, right, the photosphere is the visible part of a star, right? And the question is about iron atoms in two different stars, star_1 and star_2.

The problem says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. So, the excitation here probably refers to the energy levels they're in. I remember that in thermal equilibrium, like in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of particles in different energy levels is given by the Boltzmann distribution.

Wait, Boltzmann distribution says that the population of a particular energy level is proportional to exp(-E/(kT)), where E is the energy of the level, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. So if the energy difference between two levels is delta E, the ratio of populations would depend on exp(-delta E/(k T)).

In this problem, for star_1, the number of excited iron atoms is twice that of star_2. Let me think. Let's denote N1 as the population of the excited state in star_1, N2 as that in star_2. So N1 = 2 * N2.

But wait, in LTE, the ratio is determined by (g1/g2) * exp(- (E1 - E2)/(k T)). Oh right, g factors are the statistical weights, but the question says the energy difference is the same for both stars, so maybe I can assume g1 and g2 are the same for both stars? Or does it even matter here?

Wait, the problem says the energy difference is approximately 1.38e-23 J. So E = 1.38e-23 J is the energy difference between the two levels we're considering. So for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or some other lower state) would be given by the Boltzmann factor.

So for star_1, N1 = (g1/g2) * exp( - E/(k T1) ) * N2, but wait, no, wait. The ratio N1/N2 would be (g1/g2) * exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) for each star, but since in this case, the energy difference is the same for both stars, E1 - E2 is the same, say delta E = E.

So for star_1: N1 = (g1/g2) * exp(- E/(k T1)) * N_ground_1
Similarly, for star_2: N2 = (g1/g2) * exp(- E/(k T2)) * N_ground_2

Wait, but if we're comparing the same energy levels, maybe the ground state populations are related. Or perhaps the ratio N1/N2 is (N1/N_ground1) / (N2/N_ground2) ) * (g1/g2)²? Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.

Let me think again. The question says that the excited level in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So N1_excited = 2 * N2_excited.

Assuming that the ratio of the excited state to the ground state can be expressed as (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(- delta E / (k T)).

So, for star_1: (N1_upper / N1_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - E/(k T1) )
For star_2: (N2_upper / N2_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - E/(k T2) )

But wait, the question states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Wait, perhaps the observed line strength or the population in the excited state is twice as much. So maybe N1_upper = 2 * N2_upper.

Wait, but that depends on the total number of atoms in each state. Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is such that the population ratio is twice. So N1_upper / N1_lower = 2 * (N2_upper / N2_lower).

Wait, no, that might not be the case. Let me think. The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. I think that refers to the ratio of the excited state population to the total population. Or maybe to another ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state. So if N1_upper is twice N2_upper, but perhaps the ground state is different in each star. Hmm, but maybe I can make a simplifying assumption to find the relationship between their temperatures.

Let me try setting up the equations. Let me denote for each star, the ratio of the upper level to the lower level, which I'll call R1 for star_1 and R2 for star_2.

So R1 = (g_upper/g_lower) exp( - E/(k T1) )
R2 = (g_upper/g_lower) exp( - E/(k T2) )

We know that R1 = 2 R2.

Wait, no, wait the problem says that the excitation is twice. So perhaps the ratio of the excited state in star_1 to that in star_2 is 2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2."

So perhaps the number of excited atoms is twice as high in star_1 than in star_2. So N1_excited = 2 N2_excited.

But without knowing the total number of atoms, perhaps the ratio can be expressed in terms of the Boltzmann factors.

Assuming that the number of atoms in the lower state can be considered as the same for both stars? Well, not necessarily. So maybe it's better to take the ratio of (excited atoms) in each star.

So, N1_upper / N1_lower = R1 = (g_upper/g_lower) exp( - E/(k T1) )
N2_upper / N2_lower = R2 = (g_upper/g_lower) exp( - E/(k T2) )

But N1_upper = 2 N2_upper.

Wait, but that's not the ratio of their excited atoms relative to each other. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the ratio of their excited atoms relative to their own ground states.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of N1_upper to N2_upper is 2.

So N1_upper = 2 N2_upper.

But each R is N_upper / N_lower. So N1_upper = R1 * N1_lower
N2_upper = R2 * N2_lower

So substituting, R1 * N1_lower = 2 (R2 * N2_lower )

But without knowing N1_lower and N2_lower, perhaps I can make an assumption that the total number of iron atoms is the same in both stars, or that the lower state populations are the same. That might not be a valid assumption, but perhaps it's necessary for the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is expressed as (N1_upper / N2_upper) = 2. So,

R1 * N1_lower / ( R2 * N2_lower ) ) = 2.

But unless I know something about N1_lower and N2_lower, I can't proceed. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, perhaps the key is to realize that when in LTE, the ratio of the populations depends on the exponential term. So if the excitation is twice as high in star_1, perhaps that implies that the ratio is 2.

But I'm a bit confused. Let's think differently. Let's say that for star_1, the population in the excited state is N1, and for star_2 it's N2. Then N1 = 2 N2.

But each N is determined by the Boltzmann factor. So for each star:

N1 = N0_1 * (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( - E/(k T1) )
N2 = N0_2 * (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( - E/(k T2) )

But without knowing N0_1 and N0_2, which are the total populations, perhaps we can find the ratio N1/N2.

So N1/N2 = (N0_1/N0_2) * [ exp( - E/(k T1) ) / exp( - E/(k T2) ) ]

Which simplifies to (N0_1/N0_2) * exp( E (1/(k T2) - 1/(k T1)) )

But I don't know if N0_1 and N0_2 are the same. Hmm. Maybe the total number of atoms in each level is the same for both stars? I don't think that's a safe assumption.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The question provides the energy difference, delta E = 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute the ratio of the Boltzmann factors.

We have N1_upper = 2 N2_upper.

Assuming that the ratio is due to the Boltzmann factors, and perhaps the g factors are the same for both stars (since it's the same element, iron), then:

N1_upper / N2_upper = [ exp( - delta E/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( - delta E/(k T2) ) ]

Which is exp( delta E/(k T2) - delta E/(k T1) )

So 2 = exp( (delta E/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Taking natural logs on both sides:

ln(2) = (delta E / k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, but wait, that would be:

ln(2) = (delta E/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

But delta E is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute delta E/(k).

Wait, Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So delta E / k would be (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So delta E / k = 1 K.

So ln(2) = 1 * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which rearranges to ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, that's ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So ln(2) equals (T1 - T2) divided by (T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ), which matches.

But wait, in my equation, ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) → which is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So our equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which is option D.

The problem involves comparing the excitation levels of iron atoms in the photospheres of two stars, star_1 and star_2, under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). According to the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations of two energy levels in LTE is given by:

\[
\frac{N_{\text{upper}}}{N_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_{\text{upper}}\) and \(g_{\text{lower}}\) are the statistical weights of the upper and lower energy levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

The problem states that the number of excited iron atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2, i.e., \(N_1^{\text{upper}} = 2N_2^{\text{upper}}\). Assuming the statistical weights \(g_{\text{upper}}/g_{\text{lower}}\) are the same for both stars, the ratio of the populations can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{N_1^{\text{upper}}}{N_2^{\text{upper}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) \Big/ \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{N_1^{\text{upper}}}{N_2^{\text{upper}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{N_1^{\text{upper}}}{N_2^{\text{upper}}}\right) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Given that \(N_1^{\text{upper}} = 2N_2^{\text{upper}}\), we have \(\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\). Substituting \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\) and \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), we find:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \, \text{K}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}.
\]

Rewriting in terms of \(T_1\) and \(T_2\):

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options do not align with the derived relationship.
