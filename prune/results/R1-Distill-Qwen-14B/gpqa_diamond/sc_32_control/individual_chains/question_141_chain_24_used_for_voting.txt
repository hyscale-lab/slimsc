Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down step by step. The question is about the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think carefully.

First, I need to understand what the starting material looks like. 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Wait, the 'd' probably stands for deuterium. So, this is a bromobenzene derivative where the bromine is attached to position 1, and there's a deuterium somewhere, but I'm not sure exactly where. Hmm. Oh wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So, two substituents: Br at position 1 and D (deuterium) at position 2.

Wait, benzene is a ring with six carbons. So numbering them: position 1 is Br, position 2 is D. The other positions are H. So the structure is Br attached to C1, D attached to C2, and the rest are H.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. In aromatic chemistry, especially when dealing with deuterium, this might lead to a dehydrohalogenation or elimination, but wait, another possibility is a substitution or elimination reaction.

Wait, but wait a second. Benzene is generally unreactive unless under specific conditions. However, when substituted with strong electron-withdrawing groups like halogens, it can undergo certain reactions. But in this case, it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene.

Wait, so NaNH2 is a strong base. In a polar aprotic solvent like ammonia, it can deprotonate things. But in aromatic chemistry, when there's a deuterium nearby, deprotonation of adjacent protons (if any) might lead to elimination, but maybe more relevant here is considering any possible elimination or coupling reactions.

Alternatively, NaNH2 is known to induce elimination in some cases. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the possible reactions of bromobenzene derivatives with strong bases.

Bromobenzene is typically not very reactive towards elimination because it's a meta director. Wait, but wait, our molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So, positions 1 (Br) and 2 (D) are adjacent. Oh, so the Br is ortho to the D.

Wait, but in aromatic systems, adjacent substituents can have some effects. But in this case, the Br is a meta director, but here it's ortho to D. Hmm. Wait, but the D is a deuterium, which is a heavy isotope of H. How does that affect the reaction?

Wait, maybe the reaction is about elimination. Since Br is at C1 and D is at C2, perhaps the base abstracts a proton (or deuterium?) adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a double bond. But wait, benzene is already a conjugated system — can't form a double bond in the ring because that would disrupt aromaticity. Oh wait, unless it's a substitution. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzyne elimination.

Wait, wait a minute. I remember that when a dihalobenzene is treated with a strong base like NaNH2, it can undergo elimination to form a triple bond, creating a benzyne intermediate. But in this case, we have only Br and D as substituents. Hmm, but D is not a halogen, so that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution. But substitution on aromatic rings usually requires specific conditions, like in a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But NaNH2 is a strong base but not typically a nucleophile in that context.

Wait, another possibility: since D is present, perhaps the reaction involves H/D exchange or elimination involving deuterium. But I'm not quite sure.

Wait, let me think again. The compound is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. When treated with NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a strong base. So, perhaps deprotonation occurs adjacent to the Br, but wait, the adjacent position is C2, which is already deuterated. So, the C2 has D, which is not acidic enough to be deprotonated by NaNH2? Or maybe the H on C3 is acidic. Wait, but in the benzene ring, the acidity of protons can be influenced by substituents. The bromine is electron-withdrawing, so it can activate the ring for deprotonation.

Wait, but in this case, the H that's para to Br (position 4) might be more acidic because of the deactivating effect of Br. Or maybe the H next to Br (ortho position, which is C2) is deuterated, so that's not available. So perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 3 or position 4.

Wait, but if the base abstracts a proton from position 4 (para to Br), that would form a benzene ring with a negative charge, which might lead to elimination if possible. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible product structures.

If the reaction is elimination, perhaps forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. Wait, but that would require losing H (or D) from C2 and Br from C1. But wait, the molecule already has D in C2. So, if the base abstracts a deuterium, that's a bit tricky. Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, can it abstract deuterium? Or would it prefer to abstract a proton elsewhere?

Alternatively, perhaps the D is not involved, and the base abstracts a proton from another position, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a triple bond. Let me recall: when a dihalobenzene is treated with a strong base, it can lose two equivalents of HX to form benzyne. But in this case, it's not dihalo, but one Br and one D.

Wait, so perhaps the reaction is a beta elimination. Let me think: if the base abstracts a proton from a position adjacent to Br, then Br leaves, and a double bond forms. But in a benzene ring, you can't form a double bond because it's already conjugated. So that can't be right. So maybe elimination is not possible, and substitution is the way to go.

Wait, but for substitution, we need a good leaving group and a suitable condition. Br is a good leaving group. So perhaps the base induces a substitution reaction. But in aromatic substitution, it's more likely to be nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires strong electron-withdrawing groups and a good leaving group. But in this case, the substituents are Br and D. D is a deuterium, which is a very weak EWG compared to, say, nitro groups.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a coupling reaction, like a Ullmann coupling, but that usually involves Cu catalysts and isn't done with NaNH2.

Wait, another thought: in the presence of a strong base, perhaps a benzene ring with Br and D substituents can lose Br and D as a leaving group, leading to the formation of a triple bond. But wait, D is not a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation where H from C2 (which is D) is abstracted, but D is not easily abstracted because it's less acidic than H?

Wait, perhaps that's not the right approach. Let me think about what NaNH2 does. It is a strong base and a source of NH2- ions. In some cases, it can promote elimination reactions, especially in aliphatic compounds. For aromatic compounds, perhaps it's involved in dehydrohalogenation to form a triple bond (like in the formation of benzyne).

Wait, in this case, if we have Br and D on adjacent carbons, but wait, D isn't a halogen. So, perhaps the reaction is not possible. Hmm, that's confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the D is a deuterium in the solvent, but no, the question says the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a cyclohexene derivative, but wait, benzene can't form a cyclohexene because it's already a six-membered ring with conjugated pi bonds.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about what products could form.

If the reaction leads to elimination of HBr, perhaps forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. But for that, we need two leaving groups: the Br and another leaving group, which isn't the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from C3, leading to an adjacent Br elimination.

Wait, or maybe the base removes a proton adjacent to Br, leading to a benzene ring with a negative charge on C2, which then kicks out Br, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. But wait, if C2 has D, then abstracting a proton from C3 would lead to a negative charge on C3. Hmm, that might not directly lead to elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from C3, making that position negative, which could lead to the loss of Br from C1, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. But wait, that would only form a double bond, but benzene is already a conjugated system. So I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2. But how? That would require the elimination of two HX groups, which we don't have here. So perhaps this isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by something else. But NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile, so I'm not sure substitution would occur here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed because the necessary conditions for elimination aren't met. But that can't be right because the options don't include zero products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, producing a benzene ring with a triple bond. But how?

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from C2, but C2 has D, not H. So, is D acidic enough for NaNH2 to abstract it? Wait, deuterium is generally less acidic than protium, so it's harder to abstract D. So maybe the base abstracts a proton from C3 or C4, which are Hs.

If the base abstracts a proton from C4 (para to Br), which is more acidic due to the electron-withdrawing effect of Br, then what happens? The ring would have a negative charge on C4, and perhaps the Br on C1 would leave, but that would require a good leaving group. Br is a decent leaving group, so maybe that's possible.

So, when the base deprotonates C4, the C4 becomes negatively charged. The Br on C1 is a good leaving group, so the ring could lose Br- and form a bond between C1 and C4? But that would disrupt the aromaticity. Wait, no, because C1 and C4 are para, so if they form a double bond... Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the loss of Br and a proton leads to the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2. Wait, but C2 has D. So, perhaps the mechanism is:

1. Base abstracts a proton from C3 (or C4?), leading to a carbanion.
2. The Br on C1 leaves, forming a carbene or a triple bond.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the possible products.

If elimination happens and a triple bond forms between C1 and C2, the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2. But since benzene is a six-membered ring, that would create a triple bond between two adjacent carbons. However, this would result in a diradical or a triple bond, leading to a dehydrobenzene structure.

Alternatively, if the base abstracts a proton from C3, the adjacent to Br, but C3 is meta to Br, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, another approach: the reaction of bromobenzene with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia. Normally, bromobenzene doesn't react under such conditions because it's not activated enough. But when there's a possibility of forming a triple bond (like in o-dihalobenzenes), the base can induce elimination to form benzyne.

But in this case, we have Br and D as substituents. So, perhaps the base can abstract a proton from C2, but wait, C2 has D, which is not easily abstracted. So perhaps the base can't abstract D, but maybe the H on C3, which is adjacent to the Br.

Wait, but C3 is not adjacent to Br. C2 is adjacent. C3 is next to C2, which is D.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let's think about the possible products.

If the reaction is elimination, the product would have a triple bond between C1 and C2, making a benzene ring with a triple bond (like o-benzyne). But to form this, you need two adjacent substituents that can leave. Here, we have Br on C1 and D on C2. So, if the base abstracts a proton from C2, but C2 is deuterated. Alternatively, perhaps the D is a leaving group, but D is not a good leaving group.

Wait, no, D is not a leaving group; it's a substituent. So, perhaps the reaction can't proceed. But that can't be right because the question provides options.

Another possibility: perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond adjacent to where Br was. But again, that would mean forming a double bond in the ring, which would disrupt aromaticity unless it's part of the conjugated system.

Wait, perhaps the product is a substituted benzene with Br replaced by something else. But I don't see what the nucleophile would be here, since NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, removing Br and a proton, forming a triple bond. So, in that case, the product would be o-benzyne (triple bond between C1 and C2). But for that, we need two adjacent leaving groups, which we don't have here—only Br and D. So perhaps that's not possible.

Hmm. Maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the deuterium doesn't affect the reaction here. Maybe the reaction is similar to bromobenzene without D. But bromobenzene doesn't react with NaNH2, so that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the deuterium is at the para position, but I thought it was at ortho. Oh wait, the compound is 1-bromo-2-d benzene, so it's ortho.

Wait, perhaps the presence of deuterium in the ortho position allows for a different kind of elimination, leading to two possible products. But I'm not sure.

Let me think about the possible products again. If elimination is possible, we would get a triple bond between C1 and C2, forming o-benzyne. But I'm not sure if the substituents allow that.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from C3, leading to a carbanion, which could then eliminate Br, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. But then the aromaticity would be lost. So that would require the ring to become non-aromatic, which is unlikely unless resonance is possible.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a deuterium and a new substituent from the base. But I don't think NaNH2 adds anything to the ring.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think about the possible options again. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

If the reaction produces only one product, then the answer is B. If two, it's C.

Wait, if the reaction forms a single product—like o-benzyne—then the answer is B. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction can lead to different regioisomers, but in this case, the substituents are fixed, so perhaps only one product is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's not an option.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a diene. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from C4, leading to a negative charge there, and then the Br leaves, leading to a diradical or a new structure.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about what I know about NaNH2 reactions with halobenzenes.

Wait, another thought—the reaction could be a Birch reduction, but NaNH2 is a strong base, and Birch reduction uses metals like Na or Mg in NH3. I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but NaNH2 isn't a Lewis acid catalyst.

Hmm. I'm really not sure. Let me try to think differently.

Another possibility is that the deuterium is a marker for a specific position, but doesn't affect the reaction mechanism. So, the reaction would proceed as if it were bromobenzene. But bromobenzene with NaNH2 in ammonia typically doesn't react; it's unreactive because the ring is not activated enough for elimination.

Wait, but wait—if the ring has a deuterium, which is less acidic than H, perhaps it affects the reactivity. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where Br is replaced by NH2. But NaNH2 is a strong base, not a nucleophile, so SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution) requires a good nucleophile and a strongly activated ring. Without activating groups, this is unlikely.

Wait, but if the Br is in the para position relative to a strong activating group, but in this case, the substituents are Br and D, which is a deactivating group. So substitution is unlikely.

So, considering all this, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but that can't be the case because the question gives options. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the deuterium is a red herring, and the reaction is simply the elimination of HBr from bromobenzene, forming benzyne. But wait, bromobenzene alone doesn't eliminate because it doesn't have the necessary adjacent leaving group. Oh, but in some cases, like 1,2-dihalobenzenes, elimination is possible. But here, only Br and D. So perhaps elimination isn't possible, so no product forms. But that's not an option.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about the possible products again. Is there any other possibility?

Wait, perhaps the D is on the same carbon as Br. No, the question says 1-bromo-2-d, so Br is on C1, D on C2.

Another approach—maybe the reaction is a coupling, like a Suzuki coupling, but that requires a catalyst and a boronic acid, which is not present here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a deuterium and an amide group, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a triple bond, but only one product is formed. Or maybe two different products based on the position of elimination.

Wait, but with Br on C1 and D on C2, elimination can only occur between C1 and C2, leading to a single product—o-benzyne. So, does that mean only one product is formed? So the answer would be B)1.

But another thought: perhaps the base can abstract a proton from either C3 or C4, leading to different products. Wait, but those positions are not adjacent to Br. If the base abstracts a proton from C3, which is meta to Br, and then Br leaves, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. So regardless of which position you abstract, the product is the same.

Wait, no. If the base abstracts a proton from C2, but that's a D, so it can't. So the only available protons are in positions where the base can abstract, leading to the same product.

So, if only one product is formed, the answer is B)1.

Alternatively, if the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's not an option. So I think the correct answer is B)1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves 1-bromobenzene-2-d (a benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2) treated with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia. NaNH₂ is a strong base, and in such reactions, elimination or substitution pathways are typically considered. 

1. **Structure of the Starting Material**: The molecule has bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2. Bromine is an electron-withdrawing group, which can activate the ring for certain reactions, while deuterium (D) is a heavy isotope of hydrogen and does not significantly affect the reactivity of the molecule.

2. **Reaction Pathway**: 
   - NaNH₂ is known to induce elimination reactions in halobenzenes, particularly forming benzyne intermediates when two adjacent substituents (e.g., halogens) are present. However, in this case, the molecule has only one bromine and one deuterium, so elimination of benzyne is not feasible.
   - Substitution reactions, such as nucleophilic aromatic substitution, are unlikely because the ring is not strongly activated by the substituents, and NaNH₂ is not a nucleophile but a strong base.

3. **Role of Deuterium**: The deuterium at position 2 does not significantly influence the reaction mechanism. It is less acidic than protium (H), so it is not easily abstracted by NaNH₂. The reaction is primarily determined by the bromine at position 1.

4. **Possible Products**: 
   - Elimination to form benzyne is not possible because there are no two adjacent halogens or hydrogens that can be removed to create a triple bond.
   - Substitution reactions are unlikely due to the lack of activating groups on the ring.
   - Therefore, the reaction does not proceed to form any products under these conditions.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the reaction does not yield any products. However, since the question provides options and "no reaction" is not listed, the most plausible interpretation is that the reaction produces a single product, likely due to a specific mechanism not fully accounted for in the reasoning.
