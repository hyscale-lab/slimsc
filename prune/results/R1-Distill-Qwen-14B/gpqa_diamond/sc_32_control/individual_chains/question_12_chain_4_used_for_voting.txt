Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay reaction. Hmm, let's see. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into a muon(+) and a neutrino. Oh wait, neutrinos are neutral, right? So the pion is at rest initially. 

The question is asking for the kinetic energies of the products. The options are A to D with different pairs of energies. I remember that in particle decay problems, conservation of energy and momentum must be applied. Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum before decay is zero, so the momenta of the products must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. 

Wait, but the neutrino is tricky because it's massless, I think. Or does it have a rest mass? Oh right, in the Standard Model, neutrinos are considered to have very small, but non-zero masses. But for this problem, I think they're assuming the neutrino is massless. So maybe we can model it that way.

So, let's think about the energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, since it's stationary. So E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV. 

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon has rest mass 105.7 MeV, so its energy will be gamma * m_mu c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy, but if it's massless, then E_nu = p_nu c.

But wait, the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so we can approximate it as massless. So E_nu = p_nu c.

Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu. But because the neutrino is massless, its energy is simply E_nu = p_nu c. Similarly, the muon's energy is sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) because of the relativistic energy-momentum relation.

So let me set up the equations. Let p be the magnitude of the muon's momentum (same as neutrino's). Then:

E_mu = sqrt( p² c^4 + m_mu² c^4 ) / c²? Wait, no, E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ), so E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ).

E_nu = p c.

And total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu. Which must equal the initial energy, 139.6 MeV.

So we can write:

sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) + p c = m_pi c^2.

Let me denote x = p c. Then:

sqrt(x² + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + x = m_pi c².

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root. Wait, but before that, maybe it's easier to rearrange.

Let me subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x² + a^2) = b - x, where a = m_mu c², b = m_pi c².

Wait, but let me plug the numbers. m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c², so a = 105.7 MeV. m_pi is 139.6 MeV, so b is 139.6.

So, sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2 ) = 139.6 - x.

Now, square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expand the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

So:

x² + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x + x².

Wait, let me compute 105.7 squared: 105.7^2 is approximately (100 +5.7)^2 = 10000 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 +1140 +32.49= 11172.49. And 139.6^2 is 139.6 *139.6. Let me compute that: 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 -0.4)^2= 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 +0.4^2=19600 -112 +0.16=19488.16.

So substituting:

x² + 11172.49 = 19488.16 -279.2 x + x².

Subtract x² from both sides:

11172.49 = 19488.16 -279.2 x.

Now, subtract 19488.16 from both sides:

11172.49 -19488.16 = -279.2 x.

Which is: -8315.67 = -279.2 x.

Divide both sides by -279.2:

x = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Calculate that: 8315.67 ÷ 279.2. Let's see, 279.2 * 29 ≈ 279.2 *30=8376, which is a bit higher than 8315.67. So 279.2*29.8= 279.2 *30=8376 minus 279.2 *0.2=55.84. So 8376 -55.84=8320.16. Oh, that's very close to 8315.67. So perhaps 29.8 gives us 8320.16, which is a bit higher.

Wait, wait, 279.2 *29.8 = 279.2*(30 -0.2) = 8376 - (279.2 *0.2) = 8376 -55.84=8320.16. Our numerator is 8315.67, which is about 4.49 less than 8320.16. So 29.8 would give x=29.8, but since 29.8 gives a product a bit higher, perhaps the x is a little less than 29.8.

Alternatively, maybe 29.78?

Wait, let me compute 279.2 *29.78.

Hmm, maybe I should just compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me do precise division:

279.2 *29 = 8096.8.

8315.67 -8096.8=218.87.

Now, 218.87 /279.2 ≈ 0.78.

So 29 + 0.78 = 29.78.

So x ≈29.78.

Wait, but earlier when I multiplied 29.8 by 279.2, I got 8320.16, which is larger than 8315.67. So perhaps x is 29.78.

So x is approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, x is p c, so p = x /c. But maybe the units are such that c=1 in these units, so x is in MeV/c *c = MeV.

Wait, no, the units: E in MeV, p in MeV/c. Because E = pc when massless. So x is in (MeV/c)*c = MeV.

So x is 29.78 MeV.

So E_nu = x =29.78 MeV.

Then E_mu = sqrt(x^2 + (105.7)^2 ) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Calculate 29.78^2: approx 887 (since 30^2=900, so 29.78 is a bit less, maybe 887).

105.7^2 is 11172.49.

So sum is 887 + 11172.49 = 12059.49.

Square root of 12059.49: let's see, 109.8^2 is about 12056, since 110^2=12100. So sqrt(12059.49) is approximately 109.8 MeV.

So E_mu ≈109.8 MeV.

But wait, the total energy should be 139.6. Let me see: 109.8 +29.78=139.58, which is about 139.6, so that checks out.

Now, the kinetic energy of each particle is their total energy minus their rest mass energy.

So KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu c² = 109.8 -105.7 =4.1 MeV.

KE_nu = E_nu - m_nu c². But if the neutrino is massless, then m_nu is zero, so KE_nu = E_nu =29.78 MeV.

Wait, but the pion's rest mass is 139.6, and the muon's rest is 105.7, so the available energy is 139.6-105.7=33.9 MeV. But in our calculation, the neutrino got 29.78 MeV and the muon got 4.1 MeV, which sums to 33.88 MeV, which is correct.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close to our calculated values. 

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

Yes, that's what we have. So the KEs are approximately 4.1 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

So the correct option should be D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the decay reaction:

\[
\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

### Key Assumptions and Conservation Laws
1. The pion (\(\pi^+\)) is initially stationary, so its total energy is its rest energy: \(E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\).
2. Conservation of energy requires that the total energy after the decay equals the total energy before the decay.
3. Conservation of momentum requires that the momenta of the muon (\(\mu^+\)) and neutrino (\(\nu\)) are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

### Energy and Momentum Analysis
Let:
- \(m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\) (rest mass of the pion),
- \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\) (rest mass of the muon),
- \(p\) be the magnitude of the muon's momentum (same as the neutrino's momentum due to conservation of momentum).

The total energy after the decay is the sum of the muon's total energy and the neutrino's total energy:
\[
E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = m_{\pi} c^2
\]

The muon's total energy is given by the relativistic energy-momentum relation:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(p c)^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2}
\]

The neutrino is assumed to be massless, so its energy is purely kinetic:
\[
E_{\nu} = p c
\]

Substituting these into the energy conservation equation:
\[
\sqrt{(p c)^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2} + p c = m_{\pi} c^2
\]

Let \(x = p c\). Then:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2} + x = m_{\pi} c^2
\]

### Solving for \(x\)
Rearranging:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} = 139.6 - x
\]

Squaring both sides:
\[
x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2
\]

Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
x^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x + x^2
\]

Cancelling \(x^2\) and simplifying:
\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x
\]

\[
279.2x = 19488.16 - 11172.49
\]

\[
279.2x = 8315.67
\]

\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
\]

Thus, the neutrino's energy is:
\[
E_{\nu} = x = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
\]

The muon's total energy is:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{x^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2}
\]

\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{887 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.49} \approx 109.8 \, \text{MeV}
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Products
The kinetic energy of the muon is:
\[
KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} c^2 = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 \, \text{MeV}
\]

The kinetic energy of the neutrino is:
\[
KE_{\nu} = E_{\nu} = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
\]

### Matching with Options
The calculated kinetic energies are approximately \(4.1 \, \text{MeV}\) for the muon and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\) for the neutrino. Comparing with the options:

- **Option D**: \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV}\) matches the calculated values.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
