Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to find out what compound E is. Hmm, let me try to break down the steps.

The question gives me a series of reactions starting from compound A and ending up with E. There are also some hints, so I should pay attention to those.

First, let's go through the reaction steps one by one.

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

And the hints are:
a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

So, the IR peaks are important. IR around 1750 is usually a carbonyl group (C=O), maybe in a ketone or ester. The other peak at 1715 is also a carbonyl, but maybe a bit different environment. Possibly a ketone again, but maybe an ester or something else.

Let's start with the first reaction: A + HCN → B.

HCN is usually used to add a cyanide group. In organic reactions, HCN can add to carbonyl groups. So if A has a carbonyl, like a ketone or aldehyde, then B would be the corresponding cyanohydrin. For example, a ketone reacting with HCN would form a cyanohydrin, which is a vicinal diol with a nitrile group.

Wait, but looking at the hints, hint a) says that A reacts with a phosphorous ylide to form a specific structure. Phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The product given is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be the ylid part, like a methylene (CH2) group but as a ylide, so maybe it's like a Wittig reagent that would add a CH2 group.

Wait, the product is 4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw this structure. So cyclopentane with substituents at positions 1 and 2 as methyl groups, and at position 4, a propan-2-ylidene group. Hmm, propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)-. So maybe it's a cyclopentane ring with two methyl groups at 1 and 2, and a substituent at 4 that's a CH2 connected to a C(CH3) group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 4-(propan-2-ylidene) meaning that the propan-2-ylidene is attached as a substituent on the cyclopentane.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So positions 1 and 2 have methyl groups, and position 4 has a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene would be a group like CH2-C(CH3)=, but wait, ylides are typically R2P=CH-R. So when the ylide reacts with a carbonyl, the R' is added to the carbonyl carbon.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what A is. If A reacts with a phosphorous ylide to form that structure, then A must have had a carbonyl group that the ylide added to. So A would have been a ketone that, upon Wittig reaction, forms the cyclopentane derivative.

So the Wittig reaction would form an alkene. Let me think: the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the ylide probably has a structure that adds a methylene group (CH2) to a carbonyl in A, forming an alkene.

Wait, perhaps A is a cyclopentanone derivative. Because when a ketone undergoes a Wittig reaction with a ylide, the carbonyl is replaced by an alkene. So if A is, say, 1,2-dimethylcyclopentanone, then the ylide would add a CH2 group to the carbonyl, turning it into an alkene. Wait, but the product given is a cyclopentane with substituents, so maybe A is a cyclopentanone with substituents in positions 1 and 2.

Wait, the product after Wittig is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the substituents are there. Let me think about the structure. So the cyclopentane ring has methyl groups at 1 and 2. Position 4 has a substituent that's propan-2-ylidene. Propan-2-ylidene would be a CH2 group attached to a CH(CH3) group, but perhaps it's a double bond. Wait, no. Ylides are typically R2P=CH-R', so when they react with a carbonyl, they form an alkene.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopentane with substituents at 1 and 2 (methyl), and at position 4, a substituent that's a CH2 group connected to a CH(CH3) group. But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should draw it out.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane with methyl groups at 1 and 2. Propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)=, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an allyl group or something similar.

Wait, perhaps the product is 1,2-dimethylcyclopentane with a substituent at position 4 that is a propan-2-ylidene group. So the substituent is a CH2 group attached to a CH(CH3), perhaps leading to a double bond somewhere.

I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Maybe I should look at the other hint, which is about the IR.

Hint b) says that A has a strong IR peak around 1750 cm^-1, which suggests a carbonyl, probably a ketone (since aldehydes are often higher, around 1720 or so, but can vary). E has a peak around 1715, which is also a carbonyl. So E is probably a ketone as well.

So, if A is a ketone, let's think about the first reaction: A + HCN → B. HCN adds to a ketone to form a cyanohydrin. So B would be a diol with a nitrile group adjacent. For example, if A is cyclopentanone, B would be 1-hydroxycyclopentyl cyanohydrin, but structure would have two hydroxyl groups and a nitrile on adjacent carbons.

Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. Reduction of B could lead to the nitrile group being reduced to an amine. Wait no, H2 and Pd typically reduce nitriles to amines, but with H2 and Pd, maybe it's a hydrogenation. Wait, HCN adds to a ketone to form a cyanohydrin, which is an alcohol adjacent to a nitrile. Then, when you hydrogenate, the nitrile (CN) group could be reduced to an amine (-CH2NH2?), but wait, I think nitrile (RCN) is reduced to RCH2NH2 under certain conditions, but with H2 and Pd, perhaps it's just hydrogenated to an amine. Alternatively, maybe the cyanohydrin is hydrogenated in a way that the nitrile becomes a methylene group. Wait, I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, let's think about the hydrogenation of a cyanohydrin. The cyanohydrin has the structure RCH(OH)CH2CN. Upon hydrogenation, perhaps the nitrile group (CN) is reduced to CH2NH2, but that's a primary amine. Wait, but the presence of Pd suggests it's a catalytic hydrogenation. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is hydrogenated to a CH2 group, as in RCH2CH2R. Because in hydrogenation, nitriles can be converted to amines, but under certain conditions, perhaps with H2 and a catalyst like Pd, you can get CH2NH2. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the cyanohydrin is treated with H2 and Pd, which would hydrogenate the nitrile group. So the nitrile (RCN) becomes RCH2NH2, but then perhaps this is further hydrogenated. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is converted to an amine, but I'm not certain about the exact product here. Let's think of the product C as having a CH2NH2 group. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation doesn't affect the nitrile, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the overall process. Let me try to outline the steps:

A → B (add HCN) → C (hydrogenation of B) → D (treatment with HNO2) → E (elimination of inert gas).

Wait, HNO2 is nitrous acid. It's often used in the formation of diazonium salts, but that's typically with aromatic amines. However, in aliphatic amines, especially primary ones, HNO2 can lead to different reactions. For example, alkyl halides via the diazonium salt decomposition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is formed via the formation of a nitroso compound. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

So, after the hydrogenation, if C has an amine group (like RCH2NH2), then treating with HNO2 would form a diazonium salt, which can decompose to form a compound that loses N2, perhaps forming a ketone. Wait, that would make sense.

Let me think: If compound C is RCH2NH2, then upon treatment with HNO2, it forms RCH2N2, which upon warming would lose N2 and form RCHO (an aldehyde) or RCOOH (if more oxidized), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps in this case, elimination occurs, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, but in some cases, the diazonium salt can undergo elimination. For example, in the presence of a good leaving group, perhaps the diazonium group leaves, forming a double bond or a carbonyl.

Wait, but in this scenario, maybe the amine group is in a position where elimination can occur. Let's imagine that C is an amine, say, a secondary or primary amine. Then, HNO2 would convert it into a diazonium salt, which upon heating would eliminate N2 and form a carbonyl group.

Wait, that's a key point. For example, if C is a primary amine (RCH2NH2), then treatment with HNO2 would form a diazonium chloride (RCH2N2Cl), which on heating (or even room temperature) would lose N2 and form an imidate, which could tautomerize or eliminate. Alternatively, in some cases, it could form an aldehyde or ketone.

Wait, perhaps the process is as follows: C is a secondary amine. Let's say, for example, (CH3)2CHNH2. Then, HNO2 would form a diazonium salt, which upon decomposition would lose N2 and form a carbonyl group. But that's in the case of aromatic amines. For aliphatic amines, the reaction is a bit different.

Wait, perhaps the process is the formation of an oxime, but that usually involves ketones or aldehydes reacting with hydroxylamine. Alternatively, maybe it's related to the Stephen reduction or something else.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach this from the structure of E, since the options are given.

The options are:

A) 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one
B) 2,3,4-trimethylcyclopentan-1-one
C) 4-methylcycloheptan-1-one
D) 2,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclobutan-1-one

All are cyclic ketones. So E must be a cyclic ketone. From the IR, E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1 which fits a ketone.

So let's think about the elimination step (D → E). D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form E, which is a ketone. The inert gas is probably N2, since in the previous step, HNO2 is used which forms diazonium salts, which release N2.

Wait, so D is likely a diazonium salt, but that can't be because D is the product after treatment with HNO2. Alternatively, D is a compound that upon elimination of N2 forms E, which is a ketone.

So if D is a compound with an nitroso group or a diazonium group, which upon elimination forms a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps D is a gem-dinitroso compound, but that's probably not it.

Alternatively, think about the formation of an aldehyde or ketone from an amine via nitrous acid. For example, a primary amine can be converted to an imine or aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is as follows:

A is a ketone.

A + HCN → B (cyanohydrin).

B (cyanohydrin) is hydrogenated to C. Hydrogenation of the nitrile group in the cyanohydrin would convert the nitrile (RCN) to RCH2NH2 (primary amine), perhaps. Then, C is a primary amine.

C is treated with HNO2 → D. The primary amine reacts with HNO2 to form a diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are unstable and can lose N2, especially if heated, but in this case, perhaps under certain conditions, the diazonium group is adjacent to an -OH group, allowing elimination.

Wait, but if after hydrogenation, C has an amine group next to an alcohol, perhaps like RCH(OH)CH2NH2, then upon treatment with HNO2, the amine would form a diazonium salt, which upon elimination would lose N2 and form a carbonyl group.

So, for example, if C is RCH(OH)CH2NH2, then D would have the structure RCH(OH)CH2N2, which upon elimination would form RCH(O)CH2, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's RCH(OH)CH2N2 → RCHO + N2.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact structure here. Let me think of a specific example.

Suppose A is cyclopentanone. Then, adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin, which would have the structure cyclopentane-1,2-diol with a nitrile group on one of the adjacent carbons. Wait, no, the cyanohydrin would have an -OH and -CN on adjacent carbons. So for cyclopentanone, the cyanohydrin would be 1-hydroxy-2-cyanocyclopentane.

Then, when hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, the nitrile group (CN) would be reduced to CH2NH2. So C would be 1-hydroxy-2-(aminomethyl)cyclopentane. So structure would be a cyclopentane ring with a hydroxyl group at position 1 and a CH2NH2 group at position 2.

Then, treating with HNO2 would convert the primary amine (CH2NH2) into a diazonium salt. Diazonium salts can be unstable and lose N2, especially under acidic conditions. So the diazonium group would break down, perhaps leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. So, the CH2NH2 becomes CH2 which then forms a carbonyl.

Wait, but that would require the elimination of two nitrogen atoms, perhaps via elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after elimination would form a double bond adjacent to the OH group, but that doesn't fit with E being a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a ketone. Let me think: if the structure before elimination is RCH(OH)CH2N2, elimination would remove N2 and form a carbonyl group. For example, RCH(OH)CH2N2 → RCO + something. But how?

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that when N2 is eliminated, the adjacent groups form a carbonyl. So, if the compound is RCH(OH)CH2N2, upon elimination, the N2 leaves, and the adjacent CH2 and OH groups form a carbonyl. For example, RCH(OH)CH2N2 → RCO + H2O + N2. But that would require the structure to allow for such elimination.

In that case, the product E would be RCO, which is a ketone if R is a cycloalkyl group.

Putting it all together:

A is a ketone → B is the cyanohydrin → C is the hydrogenated product with an amine → D is the diazonium salt → E is the ketone after elimination.

Now, considering the Wittig reaction in hint a), A would have a carbonyl group. The product of the Wittig is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So if A is a cyclopentanone with substituents, perhaps at positions 1 and 2 as methyl groups, then the Wittig reaction would add an alkene at position 4.

Wait, the Wittig reagent adds to the carbonyl group, replacing it with an alkene. So if A is 1,2-dimethylcyclopentanone, then the Wittig would add a CH2 group to the carbonyl, forming cyclopentane with a double bond between, say, positions 4 and 5.

Wait, perhaps the structure after Wittig would be 1,2-dimethyl-4-methylene cyclopentane. So the substituent at position 4 would be CH2-CH2, but I'm not entirely clear on that.

Alternatively, the Wittig product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=, so the substituent at position 4 would be a group like CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or perhaps it's a methylene group attached to a CH(CH3).

Wait, perhaps the structure is cyclopentane with two methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and at position 4, a substituent that is a methylene group connected to a CH(CH3) group. So, the substituent is CH2-CH(CH3). But wait, that would require a double bond, as ylides are typically used to form alkenes.

Alternatively, the Wittig reaction would form a new double bond in the ring. So maybe the product is a cyclopentane with a double bond between positions 4 and 5, and substituents at 1 and 2 as methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-cyclopentene. But how does that fit with the substituent being propan-2-ylidene?

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting too stuck on the structure. Let me think of the overall process.

The key is to find E as a cyclic ketone. The options are given, so let's think about which one matches the steps.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 2,3,4-trimethylcyclopentan-1-one. So the cyclopentane ring has methyl groups at 2,3,4 positions, and a ketone at position 1.

If E is that structure, then D would have been a compound that upon elimination forms this ketone.

Alternatively, looking at the options, option D is 2,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclobutan-1-one. A four-membered ring (cyclobutane) with ketone at position 1, and methyl groups at 2,3,4, and another at position 2.

Hmm. Alternatively, let's think about how the elimination forms E.

If E is a ketone, and the elimination involves losing N2, perhaps D is a compound where one of the substituents is a diazonium group adjacent to a CH2OH (from the previous steps), which upon elimination would form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a carbonyl group, which would suggest that in D, there's a structure that allows for that.

Now, considering the first step: A → B is adding HCN to a ketone, forming a cyanohydrin.

So, A must be a ketone. The Wittig reaction (hint a) implies that A is a ketone because the Wittig reagent adds to the carbonyl, forming an alkene.

So, if A is a cyclopentanone derivative, perhaps with substituents, then E would be a similar structure but with some modifications.

Wait, let me think about the possible structures of A.

Suppose A is 2,3-dimethylcyclopentanone. Then, in the Wittig reaction, it would form 1,2-dimethylcyclopentane with an added alkene, perhaps at position 4.

Wait, but the product in hint a) is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the substituent at position 4 is a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a ylide substituent. So the structure would have a substituent at position 4 that is a CH2 group connected to a CH(CH3) group, perhaps as a double bond.

Wait, that might create a ring expansion or some sort of bicyclic structure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3) group, which would make the ring larger.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's think about the IR. A has a peak at 1750, which is a strong carbonyl, likely a ketone. E has a peak at 1715, which is also a strong carbonyl, perhaps a ketone in a different environment, maybe a more substituted one, which could lead to a lower wavenumber.

Putting this all together, perhaps A is a cyclopentanone derivative, and E is a more substituted ketone.

Looking at the options, option B is 2,3,4-trimethylcyclopentan-1-one. So the ring has methyl groups at positions 2,3,4, and the ketone at position 1.

If that's E, then D would have been a structure that upon elimination forms this. So perhaps D had a substituent that upon elimination of N2 forms the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of the ketone, which is E.

Wait, perhaps the key is in the number of substituents. Let me think about the steps again.

A (ketone) → B (cyanohydrin) → C (reduced nitrile to amine) → D (diazonium salt) → E (ketone after elimination).

So E is a ketone, and its structure depends on the positions of substituents in A.

If A is 1,2-dimethylcyclopentanone, then B would be 1,2-dimethyl-2-cyanohydrin (or something similar), and C would be the hydrogenated product with an amine group.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options and see which one fits.

Option D: 2,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclobutan-1-one.

Cyclobutanone is a four-membered ring. The substituents are at positions 2,2,3,4, all methyl. So the ring looks like:

Positions:
1: carbonyl (O)
2: two methyl groups
3: one methyl
4: one methyl

So, a very crowded structure, but perhaps that's the case.

If E is this structure, then during the elimination, the substituents would have to arrange themselves to form the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure of E is a cyclopentanone with substituents leading to option B.

Wait, let me think about the initial Wittig reaction. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=. So the substituent at position 4 is CH2-C(CH3)=, which would be a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the Wittig reaction forms a double bond at position 4, leading to a cyclopentene ring.

So, perhaps A is 1,2-dimethylcyclopentanone. Then, the Wittig reaction adds an alkene at position 4, giving a cyclopentene ring with substituents.

But how does that affect the other steps?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure of A is such that after all reactions, E is a more substituted ketone.

Another approach: think about the number of substituents on the ring in E.

Looking at E's structure, the options have varying substituents. For example, option D has four methyl groups on a cyclobutane ring, which seems quite bulky.

But let's think about how E is formed. It's the product of elimination of an inert gas (likely N2) from compound D. So D must have an N2 group attached in a position that allows for elimination to form the ketone.

So perhaps D is a diazonium salt where the adjacent groups can lose N2 and form a carbonyl.

Wait, if D is RCH2N2, then elimination would form RCO, but that would require the structure to be RCH2N2, which upon elimination becomes RCO. So R must be a cycloalkyl group.

Putting it all together, perhaps E is a cycloalkanone with substituents from the initial steps.

Another thought: the reduction of the cyanohydrin (B) to form C would add hydrogen to the nitrile group, turning it into an amine. So perhaps C is a secondary amine.

Wait, if B is a cyanohydrin (RCH(OH)CH2CN), then hydrogenation would reduce the nitrile (CN) to CH2NH2. So C would be RCH(OH)CH2NH2.

Then, treatment with HNO2 converts the primary amine to a diazonium salt, which upon elimination would form a carbonyl group. So the structure would lose N2 and form RCO.

So, if R is cyclopentyl with substituents, E would be a cyclopentanone with those substituents.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the options again.

Option B is 2,3,4-trimethylcyclopentan-1-one. So the ketone is at position 1, and methyl groups at 2,3,4.

If E is this structure, then D must have been a compound where elimination leads to the formation of the ketone at position 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents in A are such that after all these reactions, the ketone ends up at position 1 with methyl groups at 2,3,4.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: look at the positions of substituents in the Wittig product (hint a)).

The Wittig product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the substituents are at positions 1,2, and 4.

In the Wittig reaction, the ylide adds to the carbonyl group, which is at position 1 in A (since the product has substituents at 1,2,4). So perhaps A is 1,2-dimethylcyclopentanone.

Then, the Wittig adds a substituent at position 4, leading to the product.

After that, the rest of the steps lead to E.

But again, I'm not entirely certain. Maybe looking for another angle.

The IR of E is at 1715 cm^-1, which is lower than 1750, suggesting a more substituted carbonyl group, perhaps in a more stable (more substituted) ketone.

Looking at the options, option B is 2,3,4-trimethylcyclopentan-1-one. The substituents are on adjacent carbons, which would make the ketone more substituted, lowering the carbonyl stretch.

Alternatively, option D is a cyclobutane ring, which is more strained, so perhaps the carbonyl would be higher in wavenumber, but in the options, E's IR is 1715, which is lower than A's 1750. So perhaps a more substituted ketone would have a lower wavenumber.

So option B has three methyl groups adjacent to the ketone, which would make the carbonyl more substituted, thus lower wavenumber.

Putting it all together, I think the correct answer is option B: 2,3,4-trimethylcyclopentan-1-one.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining compound E in a reaction sequence starting from compound A. The key steps and reasoning are as follows:

1. **Reaction Sequence Analysis**:
   - **A → B**: Compound A reacts with HCN to form a cyanohydrin (B). This suggests A is a ketone, as HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups.
   - **B → C**: Compound B is reduced with H₂ in the presence of Pd. This likely reduces the nitrile group (-CN) in the cyanohydrin to a primary amine (-CH₂NH₂), forming compound C.
   - **C → D**: Compound C reacts with HNO₂. This converts the primary amine into a diazonium salt (R-CH₂-N₂), which is unstable.
   - **D → E**: Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas (likely N₂), forming a ketone (E).

2. **IR Spectroscopy**:
   - The IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak at ~1750 cm⁻¹, consistent with a ketone. The IR spectrum of E shows a peak at ~1715 cm⁻¹, indicating a ketone in a more substituted environment.

3. **Wittig Reaction (Hint a)**:
   - Compound A reacts with a phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. This suggests A is a cyclopentanone derivative with methyl groups at positions 1 and 2. The Wittig reaction replaces the carbonyl group with an alkene, forming the product.

4. **Elimination to Form E**:
   - The elimination of N₂ from D forms E, a ketone. The substituents on the ring in E depend on the structure of A and the reaction sequence.

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This structure does not match the expected substituents based on the reaction sequence.
   - **Option B**: 2,3,4-trimethylcyclopentan-1-one. This structure fits well, as the ketone at position 1 and methyl groups at positions 2, 3, and 4 align with the reaction sequence and IR data.
   - **Option C**: 4-methylcycloheptan-1-one. This structure does not match the expected substituents or the reaction sequence.
   - **Option D**: 2,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclobutan-1-one. This structure is overly substituted and does not align with the reaction sequence or IR data.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the reaction sequence, IR data, and the structure of the Wittig product, the most likely structure for E is **2,3,4-trimethylcyclopentan-1-one**.

Answer: B
