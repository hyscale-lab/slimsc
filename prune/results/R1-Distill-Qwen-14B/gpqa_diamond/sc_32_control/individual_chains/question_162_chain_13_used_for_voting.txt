Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me think through this step by step.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit weird. So it's a two-dimensional metric because I only see dx and dy. I remember that in 2D, the area element can be found using the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. Oh right, the area element dA is sqrt(-det(g)) d²x or something like that. Wait, no, actually for a metric ds² = g_{xx} dx² + 2 g_{xy} dx dy + g_{yy} dy², the determinant is determinant of [[g_xx, g_xy], [g_xy, g_yy]]. But in this case, the metric seems to be diagonal because there's no cross term. So g_xx and g_yy are both 32/(4 - x² - y²), and g_xy is zero.

So the determinant det(g) would be (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2 - (0)^2, which is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². But wait, what about the sign? Because this is a metric; I think in 2D it can represent different types of spaces depending on the signature. The given metric has a positive coefficient for dx² and dy², so it's a (+,+) signature, which is like Euclidean. But if the denominator is 4 - x² - y², then the metric is only defined where 4 - x² - y² > 0, so x² + y² <4. That would make the radius 2, as the sphere has radius 2.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh, right, pseudosphere usually refers to a space with a different signature, like (+, -), but perhaps in 2D. But wait, the given metric is (+,+), so maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the term 'pseudosphere' might be a bit tricky. A pseudosphere in 3D is a surface of constant negative curvature, but in 2D, perhaps it's a hyperbolic plane. But here, the question is about a 2D metric. Let me think again. The area is asked for the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, maybe the metric represents a pseudosphere. So perhaps it's a 2D surface with constant negative curvature, which would have a pseudosphere metric.

Wait, the area...so in 2D hyperbolic space, the area of a circle of radius r is 2π (cosh(r) - 1). Wait, but that's for a hyperbolic plane. Wait, but the radius given is r=2. Hmm, but the question is about a pseudosphere, which might be a 2D surface with negative curvature, or perhaps a 2D spacetime with a different signature. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric given is that of a sphere in 2D. Because the denominator is 4 - x² - y², which is like the equation of a circle of radius 2. So the metric is defined only inside that circle. But wait, no, the denominator is in the denominator, so when x² + y^2 approaches 4, the metric blows up. That makes me think of the metric of a sphere approaching the equator. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the metric is given as ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me write this as ds² = (32)(dx² + dy²) / (4 - r²), where r² is x² + y². So it's similar to the metric of a sphere. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the metric is usually something like dr² + r² dθ², but this is a conformally flat metric in 2D, which might represent a sphere or a hyperbolic space.

Wait, what's the area of a sphere of radius R in 2D? Well, in 3D, it's 4π R², but in 2D it's 2π R. Wait, but this is a metric on a 2D surface. Let me calculate the area integral.

So the area is the integral over the region where the metric is defined. The metric is defined for x² + y² <4. So the region is a disk of radius 2. But the area element isn't flat because of the conformal factor. So the area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy. Wait, for a 2D metric, the determinant is (g_xx * g_yy - g_xy²). Since g_xy is zero, it's just (32/(4 - r²))^2. So sqrt(det g) is 32/(4 - r²). So dA = [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy.

Wait, but integrating this over the entire area would be a double integral over x and y where x² + y² <4. So let me switch to polar coordinates. r² = x² + y² = s, so s <4. So dx dy becomes r dr dθ, where r goes from 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π.

So the area integral becomes:

A = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

The integral over θ is straightforward. It's 2π. So A = 2π ∫ (from 0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute the integral ∫ [32 r dr / (4 - r²)].

Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → (-du/2) = r dr. So the integral becomes ∫ (32) * (-du/2) / u.

Which is ∫ (-16) (du/u) from u=4 (r=0) to u=0 (r=2). Wait, when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So the integral is (-16) [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, but when r approaches 2, u approaches 0, so the denominator approaches zero. Hmm, but let's see:

Integral becomes (-16) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

Wait, ln(0) is negative infinity. So this would make the integral diverge. So the area becomes infinite?

Wait, that can't be right. Because the metric is singular at r=2, so integrating up to r=2 would give an infinite area. So the area is infinite? But that doesn't make much sense for a sphere. Wait, no, a regular 2-sphere has finite area. But perhaps this is a different kind of surface.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the metric of a sphere with that of a pseudosphere. Oh wait, the pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. The metric given might not be that of a sphere but perhaps of a hyperbolic space.

Wait, another approach: the line element ds² is conformally flat, so the area can be found by integrating the area element. But the integral of 32/(4 - r²) over the disk might be divergent.

Wait, let me compute the radial integral. Let me make the substitution:

Let me compute the integral ∫ (from 0 to 2) [32 r dr ] / (4 - r²).

As I did before, let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 * (-du/2) ] / u → ∫ (-16) du/u.

So the limits when r=0 → u=4; r=2 → u=0.

So the integral is from u=4 to u=0 of (-16) (1/u) du. That's equivalent to 16 ∫ from 0 to4 (1/u) du.

Which becomes 16 [ ln u ] from 0 to4 → 16 (ln4 - ln0). But ln0 is -infinity, so the integral diverges to infinity. So the area is infinite.

But that's strange. Maybe the metric represents a hyperbolic plane, and the area is indeed infinite. Alternatively, perhaps the pseudosphere's area is infinite.

Wait, but the options given are:

A) 0

B)4π(x² + y²)

C)4π(x² - y²)

D)+infty

So the choices are 0, some function with x and y, or positive infinity.

But the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, maybe the pseudosphere in this context is a 2D surface with infinite area.

Wait, but in 2D, a pseudosphere (like a hyperbolic plane) has infinite area, right? Because it's non-compact and extends infinitely. But in the metric given, the area integral over the domain where x² + y² <4 would give an infinite result because of the singularity at x² + y² =4.

Wait, but wait a second. The denominator 4 -x² - y² is positive inside the disk of radius 2, but as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, making the area element diverge. So integrating over the entire area would give infinity.

So the area would be infinite. That would suggest the correct answer is D) +infty.

But wait, the pseudosphere has a finite radius of curvature. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up concepts. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a different approach, like the area of a circle in this geometry, but the question says the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2.

Wait, perhaps the pseudosphere in this case is the entire space, which is a hyperbolic plane, and thus has infinite area. So regardless of the radius, the area is infinite.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the metric is that of a sphere with finite area, but the area element's integral is infinite. Wait, but a sphere's area is finite. So this can't be a sphere, because the integral diverges. So it must be a hyperbolic space where the area is indeed infinite.

So looking at the options, D is +infty, so that's the answer.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This is a 2D metric, and the area element \(dA\) is determined by the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal (\(g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\) and \(g_{xy} = 0\)), the determinant is:

\[
\det(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

The area element is then:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

To compute the total area, we integrate \(dA\) over the region where the metric is defined. The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) is positive when \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), so the integration is over a disk of radius 2. Switching to polar coordinates (\(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\)), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi\), so:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Let \(u = 4 - r^2\), so \(du = -2r \, dr\), or \(r \, dr = -\frac{du}{2}\). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int \frac{du}{u}.
\]

The limits of integration change: when \(r = 0\), \(u = 4\); when \(r = 2\), \(u = 0\). Thus:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{du}{u} = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{du}{u}.
\]

This evaluates to:

\[
16 \left[\ln(u)\right]_0^4 = 16 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(0)\right).
\]

Since \(\ln(0) \to -\infty\), the integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the total area is infinite.

Given the options:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as the area is not a function of \(x\) and \(y\).
- **C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as the area is not a function of \(x\) and \(y\).
- **D) \(+\infty\)**: Correct, as shown by the divergent integral.

The area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r=2\) is infinite.
