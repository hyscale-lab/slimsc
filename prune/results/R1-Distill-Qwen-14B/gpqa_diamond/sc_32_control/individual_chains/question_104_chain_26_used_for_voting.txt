Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. So, when the planet tugs the star, the spectral lines shift a little. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is, or maybe the more massive the star? Wait, the star's mass is similar to the Sun in both cases, so the host stars are the same mass. 

The question says both planets have masses similar to Neptune. So, same planet masses, same star masses. But the RV shifts are different. Planet #1's shift is 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's is 7. Wait, does that mean anything about their orbital periods?

I think the RV method's measured velocity is related to the star's motion in response to the planet. The formula I remember is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K equals ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) multiplied by (2π / P) )^(1/3), but wait, that seems complicated. Maybe I should think about the simplified version since the orbits are circular, so e is zero. So the (1 - e²)^0.5 becomes 1. Also, since the planets have similar masses to Neptune and the stars are similar to the Sun, M_planet is much less than M_star. So M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star, which is about the same for both stars.

So the equation for K, the velocity semi-amplitude, simplifies to K ≈ ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) )^(1/3) * (2π / P) )^(1/3). Wait, no, maybe I should recall the formula more accurately. Alternatively, the formula I've heard is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )) ) )^(1/1) multiplied by (2π/P) )^(1/3). Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the proportionality.

But perhaps a better way is to consider that for the same star mass, the RV velocity K is proportional to (M_p) / (P)^(1/3). Wait, maybe not. Let me think. The RV method depends on the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ]^{1/3} * (2π / P) )^{1/3}

Wait, maybe that's not right. Let me think again. Oh, wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^{1/3} * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^{2/3} ) )

Since M_p is much smaller than M_*, this reduces to:

K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c P) )^{1/3} * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^{2/3} )

Given that sin i is 1 (edge-on orbit, which is the case for maximum RV signal, but the question doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume i is same for both planets, or that sin i is same, but since it's not given, perhaps it cancels out in the ratio we need to calculate.

Wait, the question asks for the ratio of the orbital periods, P2/P1. So perhaps we can set up a ratio of K2/K1 and relate it to P2/P1.

Given that K is proportional to (M_p) / (P)^(1/3) ), assuming M_* is same for both.

Wait, no, let's think again. The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^{1/3} * (2π / P )^{1/3}

Wait, perhaps better to write the formula correctly. The actual formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / (P (1 - e²)^(1/2)) )^(1/3)

But for circular orbits, e=0, so the denominator becomes 1.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the correct formula. Oh, right, I think the correct formula is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π) / (P (1 - e²)^(1/2)) )^(1/3) )

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the exponents. Let me recall correctly.

The formula is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (2π) / (P (1 - e²)^(1/2)) )^(1/3) ) 

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I can look for the dependence of K on P and M_p when M_* is the same for both stars.

Let me assume that M_* is the same, and M_p is the same for both planets (both have Neptune masses). Also, since both stars have the same mass, and the planets have the same mass, the only variables here are the orbital periods and the RV shifts (K).

So, K is proportional to (M_p) / (P)^(1/3). Because, in the formula, K is proportional to (M_p / P^(1/3)).

Wait, let me think again. The exact formula is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (2π) / (P ) )^(1/3)

Wait, no, I'm getting it wrong. The correct formula is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^{1/3} * ( (2π) / (P (1 - e²)^{1/2}) )^{1/3} )

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of the simplified version when M_* >> M_p. So M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. Then,

K ≈ ( (G M_p sin i ) / M_* )^{1/3} * ( (2π) / ( P (1 - e²)^{1/2} ) )^{1/3} )

Since sin i is the same for both planets (assuming same inclination), and (1 - e²)^{1/2} is 1 for both (since circular orbits), then K is proportional to (M_p)^{1/3} * (1 / P^{1/3} )

Wait, but both M_p are same, so K is proportional to 1 / P^{1/3}.

Wait, no. Because K = (M_p)^{1/3} * (1/P^{1/3}) ), given that the other terms are same.

Wait, that can't be right because the units would be off. Alternatively, perhaps the correct proportionality is K ∝ (M_p) / (M_*^{1/3}) ) * (1 / P^{1/3} )

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me search for the formula again. Oh wait, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (27.4 m/s) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_J) ) * (P / (year))^{-1/3} ) * (M_* / M_sun)^{-2/3} )

Wait, that's a formula I've seen before. So K is proportional to (M_p) * (1 / P^{1/3} ) * (M_* )^{-2/3}.

Since M_* is same for both stars, and M_p is same for both planets, then K is inversely proportional to P^{1/3}.

So if K2/K1 = (P1 / P2 )^{1/3}.

Wait, because K ∝ 1/P^{1/3}, so K2 = K1 * (P1/P2)^{1/3}

Wait, no. Let me think again. If K is proportional to 1/P^{1/3}, then K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^{1/3}.

Because if P2 > P1, then K2 should be smaller than K1, since K is inversely proportional to P^{1/3}.

So, in the problem, the RV shift (K) for planet #2 is 7 milliangstrom, and for planet #1 it's 5. Wait, wait, the question says the shift of the spectral line is periodic with 5 milliangstrom for planet #1, and 7 for planet #2. Wait, no, the shifts are 5 and 7 milliangstrom, so K2 is larger than K1.

Wait, but according to the proportionality, K is inversely proportional to P^{1/3}. So if K2 > K1, then P2 < P1. So P2 is shorter than P1.

But the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So P2 = x * P1, and we need to find x.

Wait, but according to the proportionality, K is inversely proportional to P^{1/3}, so K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^{1/3}.

So (K2/K1) = (P1/P2)^{1/3}.

But K2 is 7, K1 is 5. So 7/5 = (P1/P2)^{1/3}.

So (7/5)^3 = (P1/P2).

So P1/P2 = (7/5)^3 = (49/25)^3? No, wait, (7/5)^3 is 343/125 ≈ 2.744.

So P1 = 2.744 P2.

Which implies P2 = P1 / 2.744.

So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter.

But the question asks, How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So if P2 is 0.36 P1, then it's shorter, so the factor would be less than 1. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36. So the answer is option A, which is ~0.36.

But wait, I thought K is proportional to 1/P^{1/3}, so higher K implies shorter period. Because if the star is moving faster (higher K), the planet must be orbiting more quickly, which means a shorter period.

So with K2 > K1, P2 < P1. So the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? From the calculation, it's 0.36 times, which is shorter. So the answer would be ~0.36 times longer. So the correct option is A.

The question involves determining the ratio of the orbital periods of two exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both planets have similar masses to Neptune, and their host stars have masses similar to the Sun. The RV shifts (K) for the two planets are 5 milliangstroms for Planet #1 and 7 milliangstroms for Planet #2. The goal is to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the orbital period \( P \) raised to the power of \( 1/3 \), given by the simplified proportionality:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Since both planets have similar masses and their host stars have the same mass, the proportionality simplifies to:

\[
K_2 / K_1 = (P_1 / P_2)^{1/3}
\]

Given \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{7}{5} = (P_1 / P_2)^{1/3}
\]

Raising both sides to the power of 3:

\[
\left(\frac{7}{5}\right)^3 = \frac{P_1}{P_2}
\]

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{343}{125} \approx 2.744
\]

This implies:

\[
P_2 = \frac{P_1}{2.744} \approx 0.364 P_1
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the ratio \( P_2 / P_1 \) is approximately 0.36.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
