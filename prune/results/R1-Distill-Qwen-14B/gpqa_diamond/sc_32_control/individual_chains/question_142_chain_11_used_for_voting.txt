Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see what the question is about. It's about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state or entangled.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I think this is a diagonal matrix because it's a sum of projectors onto the basis states. Let me write this out in matrix form to visualize it better.

Since |0⟩ is [1, 0]^T and |1⟩ is [0, 1]^T, the matrix |0⟩⟨0| would be a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is 1 in the bottom-right. So adding them together would give a matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s off-diagonal. Then, multiplying by 1/2 scales each element by 1/2. So the density matrix ρ would be:

ρ = (1/2) * [ [1, 0], [0, 1] ]

Wait, no, actually, when you add |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|, each is a 2x2 matrix, so their sum is [[1,0],[0,1]], because each is 1 in one of the diagonal positions. Then multiplying by 1/2 gives [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position of this density matrix in qubit space. I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of qubit states. For a pure state |ψ⟩, the Bloch vector r is such that the density matrix is (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, right. For a pure state, the density matrix is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. For a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture. But in this case, ρ is a diagonal matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal. Wait, the diagonal entries in a density matrix represent the probabilities of the qubit being in the |0⟩ and |1⟩ states, respectively. Here, both are 0.5, so it's a completely mixed state. That's like a classical mixture, not a quantum one.

So for a completely mixed state, the density matrix is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, which is what we have here. Now, in terms of the Bloch sphere, pure states lie on the surface of the sphere, while mixed states are inside. The completely mixed state would correspond to the center of the sphere, because it's the maximally mixed state.

Wait, the center of the Bloch sphere is at r=(0,0,0). So the density matrix for the completely mixed state is (I)/2, which corresponds to r=0. So looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0).

Let me check the options again. Option C says r=(0,0,0). Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This is a diagonal matrix with entries \(0.5\) on the diagonal and \(0\) off-diagonal, which corresponds to the maximally mixed state of a qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states lie on the surface of the sphere, while mixed states are inside. The maximally mixed state corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere, which is represented by the Bloch vector \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).

From the options provided:
- Option A (\(r = (1, 1, 0)\)) and Option D (\(r = (1, 1, 1)\)) do not correspond to the center of the Bloch sphere.
- Option B (\(r = (0, 0, 1)\)) corresponds to a pure state along the \(z\)-axis, not the mixed state.
- Option C (\(r = (0, 0, 0)\)) correctly represents the center of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the maximally mixed state.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
