Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay, which is given as c times S. Let's break down what each part means.

First, I remember that angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics are often represented by matrices. The intrinsic angular momentum operator here is A, and we're focusing on the Y-component, Ay. The operator is given by Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix.

The matrix S has its first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So S looks like this:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Hmm, I think S is a Pauli matrix. Oh wait, yes! The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Let me recall them. The σy matrix is indeed [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S must be the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by something. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the Pauli matrices are usually written as σx, σy, σz. So σy is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. So S here is σy, right?

Wait, but wait. The problem says S is a 2x2 matrix with that first row. So S is the Pauli y matrix. Because I remember that the Pauli matrices are 2x2, and that's exactly what S is.

So Ay = c * S. And c is h/(4π). So let's compute Ay. Let me write that out.

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]]

Hmm. Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. The question is about which statement is correct regarding this process.

But wait, the options are about the eigenvalues and whether the eigenfunctions are certain things. Let's think about the eigenvalues first.

The eigenvalues of a matrix operator can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So let me set up that equation.

Ay is a 2x2 matrix, so the equation becomes:

| [ -a      (h/(4π))*(-i) ] |
| [ (h/(4π))*i     -a     ] | = 0

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (h/(4π)) * (-i) ) * (h/(4π)) * i ) ]

Wait, let's compute each part. The (1,1) element is (h/(4π))*0 - a = -a? No, wait, no. Wait, no, the matrix Ay is:

Ay = [ [0, -i] , [i, 0] ] multiplied by c = h/(4π). So each element:

(0)*c = 0
(-i)*c = -i c
(i)*c = i c
(0)*c = 0

So Ay is:

[ 0        -i c ]
[ i c       0  ]

So when we write (Ay - a I), the matrix becomes:

[ -a       -i c ]
[ i c      -a  ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - [ (-i c)(i c) ]

Wait, let's compute (-i c)(i c):

(-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

So ( -i c ) * ( i c ) = ( -i * i ) * c^2 = ( (-i^2) ) * c^2 = (1) * c^2.

So the determinant equation is a² - (c^2) = 0. So a² = c² → a = ±c.

Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So when multiplied by c, the eigenvalues should be ±c.

So in this case, c is h/(4π). So a can be h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). So the real parts are h/(4π) and -h/(4π), and the imaginary parts are zero. So looking at the options, option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh or something, which doesn't fit. Option B has real parts of ±1 and imaginary ±1/2. So probably not.

Wait, option B: The imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. That doesn't match because the eigenvalues are real here, right? Because S is a Hermitian matrix? Wait, because S is Hermitian, because its conjugate transpose is itself. Let's check: S's first row is [0, -i], second row [i, 0]. The conjugate transpose would be [0, i; -i, 0], which isn't the same as S. Wait, so S is not Hermitian? Wait, no, wait. Wait, S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is Hermitian? Let me think.

Wait, no, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Because for σy, the conjugate transpose is the same as σy. Let me compute it. The σy matrix is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. Its conjugate transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Which is the same as the original matrix because I swap the off-diagonal elements and take their complex conjugates. So σy is Hermitian. So S is Hermitian, so Ay is Hermitian because c is a real constant. So the eigenvalues of Ay must be real. So the eigenvalues are real numbers, ±c.

So the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So their imaginary parts are zero. Looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which is not correct. Option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2, which is not correct. So neither A nor B are correct.

So moving on to the options C and D.

Option C: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Wait, A is the intrinsic angular momentum operator. In quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators satisfy [A_x, A_y] = iħ A_z, etc. But perhaps more importantly, the eigenfunctions of different components may not necessarily be the same.

Wait, but for a spin-½ particle, the square of the angular momentum is A² = (A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2), which has eigenvalues (ħ² s(s+1)), where s=1/2. So s(s+1) is (3/4), so A² has eigenvalue (3/4)ħ².

But if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, can it be an eigenstate of A²? Well, since A² commutes with each component (since [A², A_i] =0 for any i), any eigenstate of A_i is also an eigenstate of A². Because A² is a Casimir operator, commuting with all components.

So for example, if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, then A² φ = (3ħ²/4) φ. So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A².

But what about Az? If φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, is it also an eigenfunction of Az? I don't think so, because the operators Ay and Az don't commute. So the eigenstates of Ay are not eigenstates of Az. So option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That seems correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, not sure what that means. The basis functions of the matrix operator? Well, the matrix is 2x2, so the basis would be the standard basis vectors, probably |+y> and |-y>, which are the eigenvectors of Ay. So the eigenfunctions are in the basis of the matrix. But I'm not certain about this.

Wait, the matrix Ay is 2x2, and the eigenvectors would form a basis for C^2. But the statement is a bit ambiguous. So perhaps option D is correct, but I'm not certain.

Wait, back to the options. Let me reevaluate.

Option C says the eigenvectors of Ay can also be eigenvectors of A² but not of Az. Since A² commutes with Ay, the eigenvectors of Ay are indeed eigenvectors of A², so C is correct.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. I think that's correct because the eigenvectors form the basis for the operator. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So which of the four options is correct.

Let me check each option again.

Option A: Im eigenvalues are ±2πh, Re ±h/(4π). No, eigenvalues are real, ±h/(4π), so A is wrong.

Option B: Im parts ±1/2, Re ±1. No, eigenvalues are real, so B is wrong.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Since A² commutes with Ay, so yes, same eigenfunctions. But Az doesn't commute, so they won't share eigenfunctions. So C is correct.

Option D: Eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but looking at the question, it's a multiple-choice question with one correct option.

Hmm, so both C and D could be correct statements. Wait, but let me think again.

Wait, the options are about what you will consider correct during the calculation. So during the process of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

So for option C, considering whether the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A² is part of the process.

But during the calculation of Ay's eigenvalues and eigenvectors, do we need to consider whether the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² or Az? Maybe not directly.

Alternatively, perhaps during the calculation, the eigenvectors are the same as the eigenfunctions, which form the basis.

Wait, the question is, during the calculation, which statement is correct. So perhaps D is correct, as the eigenvectors are the basis functions of the operator.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors for the operator. So D says that, which is correct because the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the 2x2 space.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think about each option.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. So during the calculation, this would be a correct statement, as the eigenvectors of Ay are eigenstates of A² as well.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator Ay. Since the operator is 2x2, its eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis, but does that mean they're the basis functions of the operator? Not entirely sure. But since the operator is represented in the basis of its eigenvectors, perhaps the statement is correct.

Wait, but the operator Ay is expressed in the standard basis (the computational basis, |+x> or something else?), or is it already expressed in the basis of eigenvectors? No, the matrix given is in the standard basis. So the eigenvectors are not the basis functions of Ay, unless Ay is diagonal in that basis, which it isn't. Because the given matrix S (and hence Ay) has off-diagonal elements in the standard basis. So the standard basis vectors are not the eigenvectors of Ay. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are not the basis functions of the operator as given. So option D might be incorrect.

Wait, another approach: the eigenfunctions of Ay are the eigenvectors of the matrix. So they form a basis for the space, but not the standard basis. So the statement in D is saying that these eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So perhaps that's correct because the matrix can be diagonal in that basis.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about another angle.

The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

If I were to calculate the eigenvalues, I find they are ±h/(4π). So the real parts are ±h/(4π), and the imaginary parts are zero. So options A and B are incorrect.

So the correct options are either C or D.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

As I thought earlier, A² and Ay commute because A² is a Casimir operator. So any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². But they are not eigenstates of Az because Ay and Az don't commute.

So option C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. I think that's true because the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the vector space, but the matrix as given is in the standard basis. So perhaps D is incorrect because the basis functions are standard basis vectors, and the eigenfunctions are different.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation.

So, to recap, the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), real, so options A and B are wrong. So the other options are C and D.

Now, option C's statement is correct because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. So C is correct.

Option D is about the eigenfunctions being the basis functions of the matrix. Since the matrix is 2x2, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the space. So the statement is correct. But I'm not sure if D is correct or not.

Wait, the statement in D is: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, the way it's phrased, perhaps it's suggesting that the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors in which the matrix is expressed. But the given matrix is in the standard basis, not in the basis of eigenvectors. So, for example, the standard basis vectors are |0> and |1>, but the eigenvectors are different. So the eigenfunctions are not the basis functions of the matrix as given. So D's statement is incorrect.

So the correct answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvalues of \( S \) are \( \pm 1 \), as \( S \) is a Pauli matrix. Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). These eigenvalues are real because \( S \) is Hermitian, and \( c \) is a real constant.
   - **Option A:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \), which is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).
   - **Option B:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \), which is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \).

2. **Eigenfunctions of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the total angular momentum operator) because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \). However, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \) (the \( z \)-component of angular momentum) because \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute.
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This is correct.

3. **Option D:** Claims that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the 2D vector space, the matrix \( A_y \) is not diagonal in the standard basis. Therefore, this statement is ambiguous and likely incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option C**, as the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \).
