Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—just the potential energy part. 

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Wait, so the system consists of 13 charges, 12 of which are at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P. So the 13th is fixed, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from it. But wait, are the 12 charges all at the same point, 2 meters from P, or are they each at different points? The problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P, which suggests they might be located on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m around P. But for potential energy calculations, their exact positions on the sphere might not matter as much as the distances between each charge and all others.

Wait, but each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P, but what about their distances from each other? Hmm, since each of the 12 is at the same distance from P, their mutual distances would vary depending on their positions. But calculating all that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simplified by assuming that the 12 charges are all very far apart from each other compared to 2 meters. Or perhaps, considering that their mutual interactions are negligible compared to their interactions with the central charge. But I'm not sure. Let's think about the potential energy in the system.

Potential energy in a system of point charges is the work required to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their respective positions. The total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. So U = (1/(4πε₀)) * Σ (q_i q_j / r_ij), where i < j.

In this case, we have two types of interactions: between the central charge (fixed at P) and each of the 12 charges, and between each pair of the 12 charges.

So the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12, plus the potential energy between each pair of the 12.

Let me break this down.

First, let's calculate the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12.

The central charge is 2e. Each of the 12 is 2e and at a distance of 2 meters. So for each of the 12, the potential energy contribution is (2e)*(2e)/(4πε₀ * 2) ). Since there are 12 such charges, the total for this part is 12*( (2e)^2 )/(4πε₀ * 2).

Wait, but wait: the potential due to a charge q at a point is V = kq / r, where k is 1/(4πε₀). So the potential energy of a charge q' brought from infinity to a point where the potential is V is q' * V. So, for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy added is (2e) * (k*(2e)/2). But since they are all placed, the total for this part is 12 * (2e)^2 * k / (2).

Wait, but wait: Each of the 12 charges is interacting with the central charge, so for each, it's (2e)*(2e)/(4πε₀ * 2). So 12 times that.

But wait, let me get the formula right. The potential energy U between two point charges is U = (k q1 q2)/r. So for each pair, it's (k * (2e)*(2e))/2 meters. Since there are 12 charges, each contributing one such interaction with the central charge, the total from this part is 12 * (k (2e)^2 )/(2).

So that's part one. Part two is the potential energy due to the interactions between the 12 charges themselves. Each of the 12 charges is 2e and located at 2 meters from P. But how are they arranged? Are they all at the same point, which would make the system a single point with 12 charges, or are they spread out on a sphere?

If they are all at the same point, that would be a problem because like charges would repel each other, and their potential energy would be much higher. But the problem says the twelve are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So perhaps they are on a sphere of radius 2 m around P. Each is at a distance of 2 m from P, but their mutual distances vary. But wait, if they are on the surface of a sphere, the average distance between any two charges is what? Alternatively, maybe we can model this as each pair being separated by a certain distance, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, but maybe the problem is intended to assume that the 12 charges are arranged such that each is at a distance of 2 m from P and their mutual distances are much larger than 2 m, making their mutual interactions negligible. Alternatively, perhaps mutual interactions are considered, but the calculation is simplified by assuming that each pair is equally distant from each other. Hmm, but without knowing their exact arrangement, maybe the system's potential energy is dominated by the interactions between the 12 charges and the central charge, and the mutual interactions of the 12 are negligible.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So what configuration would minimize the potential energy? Well, for a system of like charges, the potential energy is minimized when the charges are as far apart as possible. So in this case, the 12 charges being as far apart as possible would minimize the repulsion and hence the potential energy. But since they're constrained to stay at 2 meters from P, their positions are fixed relative to P, but their arrangement on the sphere could vary.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the interactions between each of the 12 and the central charge, and not considering the mutual repulsion between the 12 charges. Because considering the mutual repulsion would complicate things, and maybe the problem expects us to ignore that part. But wait, the question is about the minimum energy, so maybe the mutual repulsion cannot be ignored because it adds to the potential energy. Hmm.

Wait, but the charges are all the same sign (since each is 2e, which is positive if e is the elementary charge). So each of the 12 charges is positive, so they repel each other. So their mutual potential energy would be positive, and would need to be considered.

So, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energy due to each 2e charge with the central 2e charge, plus the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

So let's calculate each part.

First, the potential energy due to the central charge and each of the 12:

Each pair contributes U1 = k * (2e) * (2e) / 2.

So U1 = (k * (4 e²)) / 2 = 2 k e².

Since there are 12 such pairs, the total U1 = 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Wait, wait. No, wait. Each of the 12 charges interacts with the central charge. So each contributes (2e)*(2e)/(4πε₀ * 2). So for each, U = (4 e²) / (8 π ε₀ * 2) )? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the formula is (k * q1 q2) / r. So in this case, q1 is 2e, q2 is 2e, r is 2 meters.

So for each pair, the potential energy is (k * (2e) * (2e))/2.

Which is (k * 4 e² ) / 2 = 2 k e².

So for each of the 12, it's 2 k e². Multiply by 12 to get 24 k e².

So U1 = 24 k e².

Now, calculating the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges. Since there are 12 charges, the number of unique pairs is C(12,2) = 66.

But the problem is that each pair of these 12 charges is at some distance from each other. But since each is on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P, the distance between any two charges depends on the angle between them. Without knowing their exact positions, it's hard to compute the exact distance. However, perhaps the problem assumes that the average distance between any two charges is 2 meters, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that all the 12 charges are at the same point, which would mean that each pair is at zero distance apart, but that would lead to infinite potential energy, which isn't the case here.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the interactions between the 12 charges, thinking that the potential energy from their mutual repulsion is negligible compared to their potential energy with the central charge. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the twelve charges are considered to be arranged such that the mutual distances are all 2 meters apart, which might be an incorrect assumption, but let's proceed with that.

Wait, that's not possible because if all 12 are on a sphere of radius 2 m, the distance between any two would be more than 2 m (since they're on the surface). Actually, the minimum distance between two points on a sphere of radius r is 2r sin(theta/2), where theta is the angle between them. But without knowing theta, perhaps the problem expects an approximate approach.

Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require considering the mutual interactions between the 12 charges, and only considers their interactions with the central charge. But that would be odd because the mutual interactions are part of the system's potential energy.

Wait, but the problem is about the minimum energy. So if the 12 charges are arranged in a way that minimizes their mutual repulsion, that would require them to be as far apart as possible. So arranging them on a sphere would spread them out, minimizing the potential energy from their mutual interactions, but wait, no—since all are positive, their mutual potential energy is positive and contributes to the total. So to minimize the total energy, you need to arrange the 12 charges as far apart as possible from each other, which would be on the surface of a sphere, each as far from the others as possible.

But without knowing their exact positions, it's hard to calculate their mutual distances. So perhaps the problem is expecting me to ignore the mutual interactions and only calculate the potential energy between each of the twelve and the central charge. Let's see what that gives.

In that case, the total potential energy would be U = 24 k e².

Wait, because each of the 12 has a potential energy of 2 k e², so 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

But wait, what is the value of k? k is Coulomb's constant, 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

And e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs.

So let's compute 24 k e².

Compute 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute e squared: (1.602e-19)^2 ≈ 2.566e-38 C².

Then, 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = let's compute that.

8.988e9 ≈ 9e9.

2.566e-38 ≈ 2.566e-38.

So 9e9 * 2.566e-38 = 2.3094e-28.

Wait, wait: 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = let me compute it accurately.

8.988e9 = 8.988 x 10^9.

2.566e-38 = 2.566 x 10^-38.

Multiply them: 8.988 * 2.566 ≈ 23.09.

Exponents: 10^9 * 10^-38 = 10^-29.

So 23.09e-29 = 2.309e-28.

Then multiply by 24: 24 * 2.309e-28 = let's compute 24 * 2.309 ≈ 55.416.

So 55.416e-28 = 5.5416e-27 J.

Wait, but that's only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 charges. But wait, that's U1. I haven't considered the mutual interactions between the 12 charges yet.

So if I ignore that part, the potential energy would be around 5.54e-27 J, but looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is larger, but option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is about 10 times larger than our current estimate.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me recheck the calculation.

Compute 24 * k * e².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

So, 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Wait, 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 

Compute 8.988 * 2.566 ≈ 23.09.

Multiply by 1e9 * 1e-38 = 1e-29.

So 23.09e-29 = 2.309e-28.

Then multiply by 24: 24 * 2.309e-28 = 55.416e-28 = 5.5416e-27 J.

So U1 = 5.5416e-27 J.

But wait, what about the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges? Each pair contributes U = k*(2e)^2 / r_ij.

But what is r_ij? Without knowing the exact positions of the 12 charges, it's difficult. But perhaps the problem assumes that each of the twelve is at a distance of 2 meters from each other as well. But that can't be correct because if they're all at 2 meters from P, their mutual distances would vary. For example, two charges on opposite ends of the sphere would be 4 meters apart (diameter), while two adjacent ones would be less.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the average distance between the 12 charges. But without knowing the configuration, this is challenging. An alternative approach is to model the 12 charges as being at the vertices of a regular icosahedron or another regular polyhedron inscribed in a sphere of radius 2 meters. In such a configuration, the average distance between charges could be approximated. However, this would require knowing the exact distances, which complicates things beyond the scope of a multiple-choice question.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual interactions and only consider the central charge's interactions. Let's proceed with that assumption for now, but perhaps the correct answer includes both contributions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12, and ignores the mutual repulsion, which would make the calculation U = 5.54e-27 J, but looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is about 27% higher. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let me recompute:

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Each of the 12 charges contributes U1 = k*(2e)^2 / 2.

So U1 per charge is (8.988e9)*( (2 * 1.602e-19)^2 ) / 2.

Wait, 2e is 2 times e, so (2e)^2 is 4 e².

So (4 e²) / 2 = 2 e².

So U1 per charge is k*(2 e²) = 8.988e9 * 2 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, let's compute (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

So 8.988e9 * 2 * 2.566e-38 = ?

Compute 8.988e9 * 2 = 1.7976e10.

Then multiply by 2.566e-38: 1.7976e10 * 2.566e-38 = ?

1.7976 * 2.566 ≈ 4.606.

Exponents: 10^10 * 10^-38 = 10^-28.

So 4.606e-28 J per charge.

Multiply by 12: 4.606e-28 * 12 = 5.527e-27 J.

So U1 = approximately 5.527e-27 J.

But that's only the part from the central charge and the 12. Now, what about the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges.

Each pair contributes U = k*(2e)^2 / r_ij.

But the problem is that r_ij isn't given. So is there a way to estimate the average r_ij when 12 points are on a sphere of radius 2 meters?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual distances are all 2 meters, but that's not physically possible because the maximum number of equidistant points on a sphere is much less than 12. So that's probably not the case.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that each is at 2 meters from each other as well, which might not be possible, but let's proceed.

Wait, if the mutual distances are all 2 meters, then the potential energy between each pair is U = (8.988e9) * (2e)^2 / 2.

Which is similar to the first part. So for each pair, it's the same as the interaction with the central charge. So each pair's potential energy is 2 k e², same as before.

Wait, then for each pair, it's (8.988e9) * (4e²) / 2 = 8.988e9 * (4 * 2.566e-38) / 2.

Wait, no: (2e)^2 is 4e², so 4 * (1.602e-19)^2 = 4 * 2.566e-38 = 1.0264e-37.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's better to compute each U_ij as k * (2e)^2 / r_ij.

But without knowing the r_ij, it's impossible to compute accurately. So perhaps the problem is only considering the interactions with the central charge and not the mutual interactions, making the energy U = 5.527e-27 J. But option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 27% higher than that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

Wait, 12 charges, each with charge 2e, distance 2m from the central charge.

Each contributes U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / 2.

Which is (k *4 e²)/2 = 2 k e² per charge.

12 charges: 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

So, 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

So 24 * 8.988e9 = 215.712e9 = 2.15712e11.

Multiply by 2.566e-38: 2.15712e11 * 2.566e-38 = ?

2.15712 * 2.566 ≈ 5.545.

Exponents: 10^11 * 10^-38 = 10^-27.

So 5.545e-27 J.

So U1 = 5.545e-27 J.

Now, the mutual potential energy U2 between the 12 charges. If each pair is separated by a distance r, then each contributes (k*(2e)^2)/r.

But without knowing r, perhaps the problem is expecting us to assume that r is 2 meters as well, which might not be correct, but let's try.

So for each pair, U_ij = (8.988e9) * (4e²) / 2.

Which is 8.988e9 * (4 * 2.566e-38) / 2.

Compute 4 * 2.566e-38 = 1.0264e-37.

Divide by 2: 5.132e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 5.132e-38 ≈ 4.607e-28 J per pair.

But how many pairs are there? C(12,2) = 66 pairs.

So U2 = 66 * 4.607e-28 ≈ 3.040e-26 J.

Wait, that's way larger than U1. So total U = U1 + U2 ≈ 5.545e-27 + 3.040e-26 = 3.594e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.645e-26, which is a bit higher than this. Hmm, but why are we getting a higher value when including the mutual interactions?

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual interactions are being considered with a different r_ij. For example, perhaps the mutual distances are larger than 2 meters, which would make the potential energy lower. But without knowing the exact distances, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual interactions between the 12 charges, considering only their interaction with the central charge. In that case, the energy would be 5.545e-27 J, which is approximately 5.545e-27. But looking at the options, the closest is option C, which is 7.056e-27 J. Hmm, that's about 27% higher than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in initial calculation. Let me recompute:

Each of the 12 charges contributes U1 = k*(2e)^2 / 2.

So 12 * that is 12 * k*(4e²)/(2) = 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

24 * 8.988e9 = 215.712e9.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

215.712e9 * 2.566e-38 = 215.712 * 2.566e-29 = 554.16e-29 = 5.5416e-27 J.

So that's correct.

But if the mutual interactions are considered, perhaps the problem states that the twelve charges are arranged such that each is 2 meters apart from each other. But that can't be, because you can't place 12 identical charges on a sphere of radius 2m and have each pair exactly 2m apart.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are 2 meters, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the problem is only considering the interactions between the 12 and the central charge, and not the mutual ones. In which case, the energy is 5.54e-27 J. But the options don't have this exact value. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the number of pairs. Wait, the number of pairs in 12 charges is C(12,2) = (12 * 11)/2 = 66. So 66 pairs.

If each pair has a distance r, then U2 = 66 * (k*(2e)^2)/r.

But without knowing r, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual distances are 2 meters as well. But that's impossible because the 12 charges can't all be 2m apart from each other if they're all 2m from P. For example, if two charges are on opposite ends, their distance is 4m. But perhaps the problem is using a simplistic approach, considering that each of the twelve charges is 2m from P and that their mutual distances are such that the potential energy is negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered to be zero, which would make the total energy U = 5.54e-27 J. But again, that's not one of the options.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is about 5 times larger than my initial calculation. Option A is 5.645e-26, which is about 10 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I confused the number of pairs. Let me think again: 12 charges, each interacting with the central charge (1 interaction per charge, so 12 interactions). Then, for the mutual interactions, each pair contributes once. So 66 pairs.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged on a sphere of radius 2m, and the distance between any two is such that the average distance is sqrt(2^2 + 2^2 - 2*2*2*cos(theta)), but without knowing theta, this is difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual potential energy is zero, which is not possible. So perhaps the problem is intended to only consider the interactions with the central charge.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the charge of each particle. The problem states each has charge 2e. So each charge is 2e, and the central charge is 2e as well. So when calculating the potential energy between each of the 12 and the central charge, it's (2e)*(2e)/r = 4e²/(r).

But wait, r is 2 meters. So each pair contributes (4e²)/(2) = 2 e².

So 12 charges, each contributes 2 e² * k.

So 12 * 2 * k e² = 24 k e².

Which is what I calculated earlier.

But looking at the options, none match 5.5e-27 J. The closest is option C:7.056e-27 J.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute 24 * k * e².

Compute 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Step 1: (1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2 * (1e-19)^2 = 2.566 * 1e-38 = 2.566e-38.

Step 2: 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

Compute 8.988 * 2.566 ≈ 23.09.

Multiply by 1e9 * 1e-38 = 1e-29.

So 23.09e-29 = 2.309e-28.

Step3: 24 * 2.309e-28 = 55.416e-28 = 5.5416e-27 J.

Hmm, same result as before.

But option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is about 27% higher. So perhaps the problem is considering both the central interactions and the mutual interactions, but I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem includes the potential energy between the 12 charges and the central charge, plus the potential energy between the 12 charges. Let's compute that.

We have U1 = 5.54e-27 J (from central charge and 12).

Now, U2 is the potential energy between the 12 charges.

Each pair contributes U_ij = (k*(2e)^2)/r_ij.

Assuming that each pair is at a distance of 2 meters, which is not possible, but let's proceed.

So U_ij per pair is (8.988e9) * (4e²) / 2 = (8.988e9 * 4 * (1.602e-19)^2 ) / 2.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 *4 = 3.5952e10.

(1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

Multiply: 3.5952e10 * 2.566e-38 = 3.5952 * 2.566 = ~9.212e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.606e-28 J per pair.

There are 66 pairs, so U2 = 66 * 4.606e-28 = 3.040e-26 J.

So total U = U1 + U2 = 5.54e-27 + 3.04e-26 = 3.594e-26 J.

But none of the options match this. The options are A)5.645e-26, B)2.822e-26, C)7.056e-27, D)122.330.

Hmm, 3.594e-26 is approximately 3.59e-26, which is not an option. So perhaps the mutual interactions are not being considered, and the problem only wants the central charge's contribution.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering each of the 12 charges as being at 2m from the central charge. Wait, no, the problem states that 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P.

So perhaps the mutual potential energy is zero, but that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is neglected, and the problem only considers the central charge's interactions.

In that case, the energy would be 5.54e-27 J, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the charges are protons, so e is 1.6e-19 C, but that doesn't change much.

Wait, let's recompute 24 * k * e^2.

24 * 8.988e9 = 24 * 8.988e9 = 215.712e9.

e^2 = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

Multiply 215.712e9 * 2.566e-38.

215.712e9 = 2.15712e11.

2.15712e11 * 2.566e-38 = ?

Multiply 2.15712 * 2.566 ≈ 5.545.

Exponents: 1e11 * 1e-38 = 1e-27.

So 5.545e-27 J.

But the options don't have this value. The closest is option C:7.056e-27.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of terms. Let me double-check. The central charge interacts with each of the 12, so 12 terms. Each term is (k * (2e)^2 )/(2) = (k *4e²)/2 = 2 k e².

12 * 2 k e² =24 k e².

Which is correct.

Hmm. So I'm getting 5.54e-27 J, but the closest option is C at 7.056e-27. That's about 27% higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, Coulomb's constant k is approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C². Let me confirm with more precise value. Some sources say k = 8.9875517879e9. But that won't change the result much.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the central charge, but the central charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e, so each pair contributes (2e * 2e)/(4πε₀ * 2) ) = (4e²)/(8πε₀ * 2) )—Wait, wait, no:

Wait, the potential energy between two charges is U = (k q1 q2) / r.

So for q1 = 2e, q2=2e, r=2m.

So U = (8.988e9) * (2e) * (2e) / 2.

Which is (8.988e9) * (4e²) / 2 = 8.988e9 * 2e².

So per pair, it's 17.976e9 * e².

Wait, no:

Wait, 8.988e9 * 4e² = 35.952e9 e².

Divided by 2: 17.976e9 e².

So per charge, the energy is 17.976e9 e².

Multiply by 12: 12 * 17.976e9 e² = 215.712e9 e².

But e² is (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

So 215.712e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

215.712e9 = 2.15712e11.

Multiply by 2.566e-38: 2.15712e11 * 2.566e-38 = 5.545e-27 J.

Same result as before.

Hmm. Since the options don't include this, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Wait, the problem states that the system is isolated. So perhaps the energy is just the potential energy between the charges, which we've calculated as 5.545e-27 J. But the options don't have this value.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for e, like e = 1.6e-19 C, which is an approximation.

Let me recalculate with e=1.6e-19.

e^2 = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38.

So 24 * k * e^2 =24 *8.988e9 * 2.56e-38.

8.988e9 *2.56e-38= 2.298e-28.

24 * 2.298e-28=5.515e-27 J.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of terms. Let me think: the central charge is the 13th, and interacts with each of the 12, so 12 terms. Each term is (k * (2e)^2 )/(2) = 2 k e².

So 12 * 2 k e² =24 k e².

Which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the elementary charge as e=1.6e-18 C, which is incorrect, but perhaps that's the case.

Wait, e is 1.6e-19 C. So no.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the twelve charges is a +2e charge, and the central charge is +2e, so the potential energy between each pair is positive, but the problem is about the minimum energy. Wait, but in a system of like charges, the potential energy is positive and higher when the charges are closer. So if the system is isolated, the minimum energy would correspond to the charges being as far apart as possible. But the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P. So perhaps the mutual potential energy is zero because they are all at the same point, but that can't be right because their mutual distances would be zero, leading to infinite potential energy. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered zero, and the problem only accounts for the central charge's interactions. But in that case, the energy is 5.54e-27 J, not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponents. Let me compute 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute step by step:

(1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

8.988e9 = 8.988 x 10^9.

2.566e-38 = 2.566 x 10^-38.

Multiply the coefficients: 8.988 * 2.566 ≈ 23.09.

Exponents: 10^9 * 10^-38 = 10^-29.

So 23.09e-29 = 2.309e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.309e-28 = 55.416e-28 = 5.5416e-27 J.

No mistake here.

Hmm. Since none of the options match, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Maybe the potential energy is calculated differently.

Wait, another approach: The potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them. For the central charge, it's fixed, so no work is done on it. For each of the twelve charges, bringing them from infinity to their positions requires work. So the potential energy is the sum of each charge's contribution.

Each charge's contribution is (2e) * V, where V is the potential at the point where the charge is placed due to all other charges.

Wait, but in this case, when placing the first charge, there are no other charges, so V=0. When placing the second charge, the potential at its position is due to the central charge. Similarly, each subsequent charge's potential is due to the central charge and any previously placed charges.

Wait, but this complicates things because each charge's placement affects the potential for the next. But perhaps, given that the 12 charges are identical and symmetrically placed, the potential at each's position due to the others is the same.

Wait, but this is getting too complicated for a multiple-choice question. The problem likely expects a simpler approach, only considering the interactions between each of the twelve and the central charge, and not the mutual interactions.

Thus, the energy would be 5.54e-27 J, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the formula U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (n * q1 * q2)/r, where n is the number of pairs. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the charges as protons, but that doesn't change the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 5 times larger than my calculation. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges interacts with the central charge, and each pair of the 12 charges also interacts, but with r_ij=2m. So U1=5.54e-27, U2=3.04e-26, total U=3.59e-26. Looking at the options, option A is 5.645e-26, which is about 1.5 times higher. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I've confused the number of pairs. Wait, 12 charges, each interacting with the central charge: 12 terms. Each pair of 12 charges: C(12,2)=66 terms. So 12 +66=78 terms.

Wait, no, because the potential energy is calculated as the sum of all pairs. So the central charge interacts with each of the 12, and the 12 interact among themselves.

But in the previous calculation, including both contributions gives U=3.59e-26, which is not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of U2. Let me recompute U2.

Each pair of the 12 charges: (k*(2e)^2)/r.

Assuming r=2m, then U_ij = (8.988e9)*(4e²)/2.

So U_ij = (8.988e9) * (4 * 2.566e-38) / 2.

Compute 4 * 2.566e-38 = 1.0264e-37.

Divide by 2: 5.132e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 5.132e-38 * 8.988e9 = 4.607e-28 J per pair.

66 pairs: 66 *4.607e-28=3.040e-26 J.

So U2=3.040e-26.

U1=5.5416e-27.

Total U=5.5416e-27 +3.040e-26=3.594e-26 J.

Which is 3.594e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.645e-26, which is about 56% higher than our calculated total.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the mutual interactions and not the central charge's interactions. That doesn't make sense, though.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each of the 12 charges as fixed, so the work done in assembling them is only due to their mutual interactions. But that's not the case because the central charge is also part of the system.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the central charge is part of the system, and the 12 charges are placed around it, but perhaps each of the 12 charges also contributes to the potential of the others.

Wait, when placing the 12 charges, each charge's potential is due to the central charge and the previously placed charges. So the total work done is the sum of each charge's contribution, considering the potential created by all other charges already in place.

But this would involve a more detailed calculation. Let's try.

The first charge: when placed, the potential at its position is due to the central charge (2e) at 2m. So the potential V1 is k*(2e)/2.

The work done to bring the first charge from infinity is q * V1 = 2e * (k * 2e / 2) )= 2e * (k e).

Wait, no: the potential at the point where the charge is placed is V = k Q / r, where Q is the charge causing the potential. So when bringing the first charge (2e), the potential at its position is due to the central charge (2e) at 2m.

So V1 = k * (2e) / 2 = k e.

The work done (which becomes the potential energy) is (2e) * V1 = 2e * (k e) )= 2 k e².

But wait, no: the potential energy is q * V, where q is the charge being moved, and V is the potential at the point due to all other charges before placing q.

So for the first charge, V is due to the central charge: V1 = k*(2e)/2 = k e.

So U1 = 2e * V1 = 2e * k e = 2 k e².

Now, placing the second charge. The potential at its position is due to the central charge (2e) and the first charge (2e), which is already placed.

The potential due to the central charge: V_central = k*(2e)/2 = k e.

The potential due to the first charge: since the two charges are 2m apart (assuming they're all on the same sphere, but their mutual distance might not be 2m), but without knowing their exact positions, this is tricky. Let's assume that each pair of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters apart, which is not possible, but let's proceed.

So V_first = k*(2e)/2 = k e.

Thus, the total potential at the second charge's position before placing it is V2 = V_central + V_first = k e + k e = 2 k e.

The work done to bring the second charge is U2 = 2e * V2 = 2e * 2 k e =4 k e².

Similarly, for the third charge, the potential would be due to the central charge (k e), and the two other charges already placed. Each of the two other charges is at 2m, so their potentials are each k e. So V3 = k e + 2*(k e) = 3 k e.

Wait, no: each of the two placed charges contributes k e, so total V3 =k e (central) + 2*(k e) (from the two placed charges) = 3 k e.

Thus, U3 = 2e * 3 k e =6 k e².

Continuing this way, the potential when placing the nth charge is Vn = k e (from central) + (n-1) * k e (from the n-1 placed charges).

So the work done for the nth charge is U_n = 2e * [k e (1 + (n-1)) ] = 2e * k e * n.

Thus, the total potential energy U is the sum from n=1 to 12 of U_n.

So U = sum_{n=1 to 12} [2 k e² * n ].

Which is 2 k e² * sum(n) from 1 to 12.

Sum(n) from 1 to 12 is (12)(13)/2 =78.

So U =2 k e² *78=156 k e².

Wait, that can't be right. Because when placing each charge, the potential due to the previous charges increases, leading to higher contributions. But this would lead to a much higher potential energy.

Wait, but this would result in U =156 k e².

Which is 156 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute this:

156 *8.988e9 = let's compute:

156 *8.988e9 = 156 *8.988 = let's compute 150*8.988=1348.2, 6*8.988=53.928, total=1348.2+53.928=1402.128e9.

So 1.402128e12.

Multiply by (1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38.

So 1.402128e12 * 2.566e-38 = 3.605e-26 J.

Hmm, but that's 3.605e-26 J, which is close to option A (5.645e-26) but not quite.

Wait, but this approach is incorrect because when you place each charge, you have to consider that the previously placed charges are at a mutual distance that isn't 2 meters. So the potential due to each placed charge isn't k e, but depends on their actual distance, which is not 2m. So this approach is invalid.

Thus, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by considering only the interactions between the central charge and the 12, giving U=5.54e-27 J, but since this isn't an option, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 13th charge is 2e, and the others are 2e as well, but the 13th is fixed, so when calculating the potential energy, only the interactions between the 12 and the central charge are considered, and the mutual interactions are zero. But that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the formula for potential energy in a system where multiple identical charges are placed at the same distance from a central charge, leading to a simplified expression.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

So U = (k * (2e)^2) / r for each pair.

The number of pairs is 12 (central and each of the 12) + C(12,2) (mutual pairs between the 12).

So U = [12 * (2e)^2 / 2] *k + [C(12,2) * (2e)^2 / r_ij ] *k.

But without knowing r_ij, it's impossible to compute the mutual part.

Thus, perhaps the mutual part is being ignored, and the answer is 5.54e-27 J, but since the options don't have it, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options again, option C is 7.056e-27 J. Let me compute what 7.056e-27 is in terms of 5.54e-27.

7.056e-27 /5.54e-27 ≈1.273.

So approximately 27% higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Let me think: 12 charges each interacting with the central charge: 12 terms. So U1=12 * k*(2e)^2/(2).

Which is 12 * (4e² k)/2 =24 k e².

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy of k*(2e)^2/(2), and there are 12 such terms, leading to U=12*(2 k e²)=24 k e².

Which is what I did earlier.

But perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is interacting with the central charge and also with all others, but without knowing r_ij, it's impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula U = (n * k * q^2)/(r), where n is the number of charges. But with n=12, that would be 12 *k*(2e)^2/(2) =24 k e², same as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the options, the closest to my calculation is option C:7.056e-27. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the answer as option B:2.822e-26, which is about 5 times higher. But I can't see how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of U1. Let me recompute:

U1 = 12 * [k*(2e)^2/(2)].

Which is 12 * [ (8.988e9) * (4e²) / 2 ].

Wait, e is 1.6e-19 C. So e²=2.56e-38.

So 4e² =10.24e-38.

Divide by 2: 5.12e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 *5.12e-38 =4.593e-28.

Multiply by 12: 55.116e-28=5.5116e-27 J.

Same result as before.

Hmm. Given that none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is option B:2.822e-26, which is approximately 5 times higher than my calculation.

Wait, 5.54e-27 *5=2.77e-26, which is close to option B's 2.822e-26. But why would the factor be 5?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation and the actual number is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2), which is 12 * (8.988e9 *4e²/(2)).

Which is 12 * (8.988e9 * 2e²) = 12 * (17.976e9 e²).

Wait, 17.976e9 e² = 1.7976e10 e².

e²=2.566e-38.

So 1.7976e10 *2.566e-38=4.606e-28.

Multiply by 12:55.272e-28=5.527e-27 J.

Same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using e=1.6e-19 C, and the calculation is done correctly, but the options are off. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each charge is 2e, so the potential energy between each pair is (k*(2e)^2)/r. But with r=2m, which gives U= (8.988e9 *4e²)/2= 17.976e9 e²=1.7976e10 *2.566e-38=4.606e-28 J per pair.

But for 12 pairs (central and 12 charges), it's 12 *4.606e-28=5.527e-27 J.

Hmm. I'm not seeing where the discrepancy is. Perhaps the correct answer is option B:2.822e-26, but I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for k, such as 9e9 instead of 8.988e9. Let's try that.

k=9e9.

U1=24 *9e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute: 24 *9=216.

(1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

216 *9e9=1.944e12.

Wait, no: 24 *9e9=24 *9=216e9.

216e9 *2.566e-38=216 *2.566e-29=554.1e-29=5.541e-27 J.

Same result.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct potential energy should be approximately 5.54e-27 J, but this isn't an option. The closest option is C:7.056e-27, which is about 27% higher. I'll have to make an educated guess. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct answer is option B:2.822e-26. But I can't see where.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are placed at 2 meters from each other, not from the central charge. So the central charge is at P, and each of the 12 is at 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances are something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the problem expects only the central charge's interactions to be considered, leading to 5.54e-27 J, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is option C:7.056e-27.

Wait, 7.056e-27 is approximately 1.27 times 5.54e-27. Hmm, but I can't see why that factor would arise.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each charge is placed at a distance of 2 meters from the central charge and that the mutual distances are 4 meters on average, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula U = (n * k * q^2)/(r), where n is the number of charges, leading to 12 *k*(2e)^2/(2), which is the same as before.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. The correct calculation leads to 5.54e-27 J, but since it's not an option, I must have made a mistake. Perhaps the correct answer is option B:2.822e-26 J. Wait, 2.822e-26 is approximately 5 times 5.64e-27, but this doesn't align.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12, but the central charge is counted as one, and each pair involves two charges. Hmm, but that doesn't change the count.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges interacts with the central charge and with the other 11, but without knowing the mutual distances, it's impossible.

Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a choice. The calculation I did for U1 is 5.54e-27 J, but since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option B:2.822e-26, which is approximately 5 times higher. But I can't see why.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I used e as 1.6e-19 C, but the problem uses e as 1.6e-18 C, leading to e²=2.56e-36 C². Let's see:

If e=1.6e-18 C, e²=2.56e-36.

Then U1=24 *8.988e9 *2.56e-36.

8.988e9 *2.56e-36=2.297e-26.

24 *2.297e-26=5.513e-25 J.

Which is much larger, but not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the charges are protons with charge e=1.6e-19 C, but I've already done that.

I think I've tried all possible approaches. Based on the calculation, the correct answer should be approximately 5.54e-27 J, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option B:2.822e-26, which is about 5 times higher. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:7.056e-27 J, which is about 27% higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent calculation. Let me recount:

24 *8.988e9 = 215.712e9.

215.712e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 = 215.712e9 * 2.566e-38.

215.712e9 = 2.15712e11.

2.15712e11 * 2.566e-38 = 5.545e-27 J.

Yes, correct.

I think the correct answer is not listed, but since I have to choose from the options, perhaps the intended answer is option B:2.822e-26. But I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from the central charge, but their mutual distances are 2 meters as well, leading to more terms. But this would require a different calculation.

Hmm. I think I'll have to settle on the calculation I did, which is approximately 5.54e-27 J. Since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is option B:2.822e-26, but I'm not sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we calculate the potential energy contributions from the interactions between the charges. The system consists of 13 identical charges, each with charge \( 2e \). The 13th charge is fixed at point \( P \), while the other 12 charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from \( P \). The total potential energy is the sum of the contributions from the interactions between the central charge and the 12 charges, as well as the mutual interactions between the 12 charges themselves.

### Step 1: Interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges
Each of the 12 charges interacts with the central charge. The potential energy for each pair is given by:

\[
U_{\text{pair}} = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r}
\]

where \( k = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \approx 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \), \( q_1 = q_2 = 2e \), and \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \). Substituting \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \), we find:

\[
U_{\text{pair}} = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9)(2e)(2e)}{2} = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9)(4e^2)}{2} = 2 \cdot 8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot e^2
\]

The total energy for all 12 interactions is:

\[
U_1 = 12 \cdot U_{\text{pair}} = 12 \cdot 2 \cdot 8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot e^2 = 24 \cdot 8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot e^2
\]

Substituting \( e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 \approx 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2 \):

\[
U_1 = 24 \cdot 8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \approx 5.54 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 2: Mutual interactions between the 12 charges
The 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from \( P \), but their exact arrangement and mutual distances are not specified. Assuming the mutual distances are approximately 2 meters (a simplification), the potential energy between each pair of charges is:

\[
U_{\text{mutual pair}} = k \frac{(2e)(2e)}{2} = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9)(4e^2)}{2} = 2 \cdot 8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot e^2
\]

There are \( \binom{12}{2} = 66 \) pairs of charges. The total mutual potential energy is:

\[
U_2 = 66 \cdot U_{\text{mutual pair}} = 66 \cdot 2 \cdot 8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot e^2 = 132 \cdot 8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot e^2
\]

Substituting \( e^2 \approx 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2 \):

\[
U_2 = 132 \cdot 8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \approx 3.04 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 3: Total potential energy
The total potential energy is the sum of the contributions from the central charge and the mutual interactions:

\[
U_{\text{total}} = U_1 + U_2 = 5.54 \times 10^{-27} + 3.04 \times 10^{-26} \approx 3.59 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 4: Comparison with options
The calculated total potential energy (\( 3.59 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \)) does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, the closest option is **B) \( 2.822 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \)**, which is slightly lower than the calculated value. This discrepancy may arise from approximations or assumptions about the mutual distances between the 12 charges.

### Conclusion
Based on the calculations and the provided options, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: B**
