Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but let me think.

Wait, what's 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, right, that's a benzene ring with a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium (d) at position 2. Or wait, is it bromine at position 1 and a methyl group? No, no, the 'd' probably stands for deuterium. So it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So the structure is a benzene ring where the bromine is attached to carbon 1, and carbon 2 has a deuterium instead of a hydrogen.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. But wait, in what context? Oh right, in aromatic substitution reactions. NaNH2 is a strong base and a good nucleophile. I think it's used in elimination or substitution reactions, especially under strongly basic conditions.

So, considering the starting material, 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. Let's draw the structure. Benzene ring, Br at position 1, and a D (deuterium) at position 2. So positions are 1 (Br), 2 (D), and the rest are Hs.

When you treat this with NaNH2 in NH3, it's a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction? Or perhaps a substitution. Wait, bromobenzene is not very reactive towards nucleophilic substitution under normal conditions because it's an aromatic ring, and substitution on aromatic rings usually requires specific conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic substitution, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction involves a benzene ring undergoing some kind of substitution where the leaving group (Br) is replaced by something else. But what's the nucleophile here? NaNH2 provides NH2^- as the nucleophile. So perhaps it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution.

But nucleophilic aromatic substitution typically occurs when the ring is strongly activated towards nucleophilic attack, which usually requires electron-withdrawing groups. In this case, the ring has Br, which is a good leaving group but adjacent to a deuterium. Wait, Br is an electron-withdrawing group, activating the ring towards certain reactions. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but that's more for aliphatic halides. Wait, under strong base conditions, could this lead to elimination? But benzene is a ring, so elimination might not be straightforward.

Wait, another angle: Perhaps it's a case of aromatic substitution, and the base induces a substitution where the NH2^- attacks the ring. But I'm not too confident. Let me think about what NaNH2 does in such reactions.

I recall that NaNH2 can also act as a strong base, causing deprotonation. But under what conditions? In aromatic systems, sometimes deprotonation can lead to elimination or rearrangement. Wait, in the case of tosyl chloride or similar, but that's not this case.

Wait, perhaps this is a case of elimination, where the Br leaves, and a double bond forms. But that would require adjacent Hs, right? Because elimination typically occurs via E2 mechanism, where the H is abstracted from a neighboring carbon, leading to the formation of a double bond.

In the given compound, 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, the Br is on C-1, and C-2 has a D. So C-1 and C-2 are adjacent. If I remove a proton (H) from C-2, but wait, it's a D, not an H. So deuterium is present, not hydrogen. But NaNH2 is a strong base, so could it deprotonate adjacent positions? Wait, but in this compound, the adjacent position (C-2) has D, not H. So maybe elimination isn't feasible because there's no H to abstract.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br leaves, and a ring contraction or expansion occurs. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a bromide displacement. So the Br would leave, and the NH2^- would attack the ring. But for that to happen, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic substitution. Bromine is a meta-directing group, and it's deactivating. So unless the ring is activated, like with electron-withdrawing groups, nucleophilic substitution doesn't happen easily.

Wait, but in this case, the ring has a bromine and a deuterium. So maybe the deuterium is not very activating. So perhaps the substitution doesn't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a case of elimination leading to a benzene ring with a double bond, but that doesn't make sense because benzene is already a conjugated ring. So elimination would not form a more substituted double bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: think about possible products. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. If the reaction is substitution, NH2^- would replace Br. So would the product be 1-amino-2-deutero benzene? But under what conditions would that happen? Also, considering if the reaction is possible.

But I'm not so sure because nucleophilic aromatic substitution is tricky. It usually requires the ring to be electron-deficient, so that the leaving group can depart. Bromine is meta-directing, but I don't know if that's sufficient.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction could be a dehydrohalogenation, but that's more for aliphatic amines. Alternatively, maybe it's a Fittig reaction, but that involves two aryl halides. Not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzidine-type reaction, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the reaction is more about the deuterium. Because the ring has a deuterium at position 2, and NaNH2 is a strong base. So maybe it abstracts a proton from a neighboring position, but wait, position 2 has D, not H.

Wait, perhaps the Br leaves, and the ring forms a benzyn intermediate? Benzynes are aryne intermediates formed via elimination of two substituents. But for benzynes, you usually need a dihalide, like 1,2-dihalo benzene. Then, in the presence of a strong base, you eliminate both halides to form a triple bond, creating an aryne intermediate which can then undergo cycloaddition reactions.

Wait, that's an interesting point. Our starting material has Br at 1 and a deuterium at 2. But wait, to form a benzyne, you usually need two leaving groups adjacent to each other. But here, only Br and D. D is not a leaving group; it's a hydrogen isotope. So maybe the reaction doesn't proceed to form a benzyne.

Hmm. Alternatively, if the Br leaves, perhaps a deuterium is abstracted, but I'm not sure if that leads to anything.

Alternatively, maybe the NaNH2 deprotonates another position on the ring, but there's no acidic protons. Wait, in benzene, the protons are not very acidic, but in certain cases, like when adjacent to electron-withdrawing groups, the acidity can increase. So in 1-bromo benzene, the protons at ortho and para positions are more acidic because the Br is EWG.

Wait, in this case, the ring has Br at 1 and D at 2. So the positions adjacent to Br (ortho) would be 2 and 6. Position 2 has D, so maybe the H at position 6 is more acidic. So NaNH2, being a strong base, can abstract that H, leading to a deprotonated benzene ring, which becomes a strong base, possibly leading to an elimination reaction.

Wait, but if position 6 is deprotonated, and we have Br at 1, maybe we can form a double bond between C1 and C2, eliminating HBr? But wait, C1 has Br and C2 has D. So if the base abstracts H from C6, then perhaps a double bond forms between C1 and C2, but you need two adjacent leaving groups for that. Wait, no, in E2 elimination, the base abstracts a proton that's anti to the leaving group, leading to the formation of a double bond.

Wait, but in this case, the leaving group is Br at C1. The H abstracted would be from C2 or C6, but C2 has D, so the H is at C6. So if the base abstracts H from C6, then the Br at C1 leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C2? But C2 has D, so would that interfere? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting somewhere. So if the base abstracts H from C6, which is adjacent to C1 (Br), then the Br leaves, and the double bond forms between C1 and C2. Wait, but C2 has D. So the structure would be C1=C2D. But benzene is a ring with alternating double bonds. I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a triple bond, forming an aryne. Wait, to form an aryne (triple bond in the ring), you typically need two adjacent leaving groups. But here, only Br and D are adjacent. D isn't a leaving group, so that might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed because there's no adjacent leaving group to form the aryne.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by NH2. But would that be possible?

Wait, but in aromatic substitution, the ring needs to be activated towards nucleophilic attack. Br is deactivating, so perhaps it's difficult. Unless under very strong basic conditions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about dehydrohalogenation, but on the aromatic ring, that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, another angle: The solvent is condensed ammonia. Condensed ammonia is a polar aprotic solvent, right? Or is it NH3 in liquid form. I think it's a solvent that can act as a base as well. So NaNH2 in NH3 is a strong base.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but again, this is more common for aliphatic compounds. For aromatic rings, elimination might not be feasible because the ring is stable and doesn't usually open up.

Wait, but in the case where the ring has two adjacent substituents that can leave, like dihalobenzenes, you can form benzynes. So perhaps in this case, since we have Br at 1 and D at 2, but D isn't a leaving group, so the reaction can't form a benzyne.

Wait, but what about the possibility of the Br leaving and the D moving? No, deuterium is not a leaving group. So perhaps no elimination occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by something else. But what? The nucleophile in the solution is NH2^-.

So, substitution of Br with NH2 would give 1-amino-2-deutero benzene. Is that possible under these conditions?

I think that nucleophilic aromatic substitution usually requires a strongly activated ring (like with nitro groups), but Br is just a moderately deactivating group. So perhaps the substitution doesn't proceed under these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but that would give zero products, which isn't one of the options.

Wait, the options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3. So, the answer must be one of these.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not so sure. Let's think again.

Wait, another possibility: The base could abstract a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to the formation of a carbanion, which could then eliminate Br^- and form a triple bond (aryne). But for that, you need two adjacent leaving groups, right? Because when you eliminate, you lose two atoms (like X and Y) to form a triple bond.

In this case, the substituents at positions 1 and 2 are Br and D, respectively. Since D isn't a leaving group, maybe this isn't possible. So perhaps the reaction doesn't form an aryne.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 3, which is meta to Br. Wait, but that doesn't seem adjacent. So perhaps that won't lead to elimination.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of other possibilities. Maybe the reaction is a simple substitution where Br is replaced by NH2. So the product would be 1-amino-2-deutero benzene.

But is that feasible? Let me think about the mechanism. For nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack. Bromine is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the ring, making it harder for nucleophilic attack.

Wait, but if another activating group is present, perhaps it directs the nucleophile. But in this case, the only other substituent is D, which is not an activating group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't substitution but elimination, leading to a different structure.

Wait, but without an adjacent leaving group, elimination to form a triple bond isn't possible.

Another angle: The reaction conditions might lead to a coupling reaction. But in this case, with NaNH2, perhaps a Ullmann-type coupling? But that typically requires a copper catalyst and aryl halides, and I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a simple displacement, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the NaNH2 isn't acting as a nucleophile but as a base. So maybe it deprotonates something. But where?

In 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, the positions adjacent to Br (ortho) are 2 and 6. Position 2 has D, so position 6 has H. So the H at position 6 is meta to Br? No, wait, position 6 is ortho to Br (since position 1 has Br, and position 6 is adjacent to position 1 in the benzene ring).

So, the H at position 6 is ortho to Br. Since Br is EWG, the acidity of the H at position 6 is increased. So NaNH2, a strong base, can abstract this H, leading to a deprotonated benzene ring adjacent to Br.

So if the H at position 6 is removed by the base, the ring would have a negative charge at position 6, and Br at position 1. Then, perhaps the Br leaves as Br^-, and the ring forms a double bond between positions 1 and 2.

Wait, but position 2 has D. So perhaps the elimination leads to a double bond between C1 and C2, which already has a D.

Hmm, but benzene is a fully conjugated system. If you form a double bond between C1 and C2 (and C6), what happens? I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the abstraction of the H at position 6 leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 6, which could then push the Br to leave, creating a carbene or some other intermediate. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a benzyn intermediate, but for that, you need two adjacent leaving groups. Since we only have Br and D adjacent, that's not possible. So elimination might not occur.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, and the only product is the starting material. But that's not one of the options either.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by NH2. So the product would be 1-amino-2-deutero benzene. But is this reaction feasible?

In nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the ring must be activated. But Br is deactivating. So unless the ring has strong activating groups, substitution won't happen. But in this case, the ring has only Br and D. So I'm not sure if substitution occurs.

Wait, if substitution does occur, then you get a single product: 1-amino-2-deutero benzene.

Alternatively, maybe elimination isn't possible, and substitution isn't feasible either. Then, the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Another possibility: the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond adjacent to the D. But I'm not sure how that would look.

Wait, in benzene, all the bonds are equivalent in a way, so forming a double bond between C1 and C2 might not change the structure much. Or perhaps it's more about the position of the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a deprotonated position and a new substituent.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible products again. If substitution occurs, you get 1-amino-2-deutero benzene. If elimination can't happen, that's the only product.

But wait, is there any possibility of forming more than one product? Like, different substitution positions?

Wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. The Br is in position 1, and D is in position 2.

If substitution occurs, the NH2 would attack at position 1, replacing Br, leading to 1-amino-2-deutero benzene.

But is there another possible position for substitution? No, because the Br is the only leaving group, and the ring is symmetrical in a certain way.

Wait, the ring has Br at position 1 and D at position 2. So if substitution occurs, you can't get anything else except the NH2 in position 1.

So that would give one product.

But wait, the options include C)2. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't just substitute Br but also involves the D in some way.

Wait, could the deuterium be exchanged? Like, perhaps the D at position 2 is replaced by something else. But under what conditions? NaNH2 is a strong base, but I don't think it would cause exchange with D.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is not involved in the reaction, so substitution occurs only at position 1, leading to one product.

But the options include B)1. So that would be the case.

Wait, but the question says "how many possible organic products are there?".

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to more than one product because of different stereochemical outcomes, but in aromatic substitution, stereochemistry isn't typically a factor because the ring is flat.

Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong about the substitution. Maybe the reaction leads to two different products.

Wait, perhaps the NH2 can attack in more than one position? But the Br is the only leaving group, so substitution should be at position 1.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from another position, leading to a different product.

Wait, if the base abstracts a proton from position 4, which is para to Br, would that lead to anything? But I don't think so, because para is not adjacent to the Br.

Alternatively, perhaps when the base abstracts a proton from position 3, which is meta to Br, but I'm not sure how that would help.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed as substitution but as elimination, leading to different products. But earlier, I thought elimination isn't possible because you need two adjacent leaving groups.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about that. Let me rethink. For elimination to form a triple bond (aryne), you need two adjacent leaving groups. But here, we have Br and D adjacent. D is not a leaving group. So elimination to form a triple bond isn't possible. So perhaps no aryne is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton that's adjacent to Br, and Br leaves, forming a double bond. So the structure would have a double bond between C1 and C2.

But wait, in benzene, all bonds are delocalized. So adding a double bond between C1 and C2 wouldn't change the overall structure, but perhaps it changes the substituents' positions.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Maybe the product would have a double bond, but since it's part of the aromatic ring, it's just a rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't produce any new product, but that's not an option.

So, putting it all together: the most plausible reaction is substitution of Br with NH2, leading to 1-amino-2-deutero benzene, which is a single product.

Therefore, the number of possible organic products is 1, which is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d (a benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2) with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base and nucleophile, commonly used in deprotonation and substitution reactions. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Structure of the Starting Material**: The compound is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, where bromine is at position 1, and deuterium is at position 2. The remaining positions on the benzene ring are occupied by hydrogens.

2. **Reaction Conditions**: NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia is a strongly basic environment. Such conditions typically promote deprotonation or substitution reactions, depending on the structure of the compound.

3. **Substitution Reaction**: Bromine is a good leaving group, and NaNH₂ provides NH₂⁻ as a nucleophile. Nucleophilic aromatic substitution (NAS) is plausible here, where NH₂⁻ replaces the bromine atom. Bromine is an electron-withdrawing group, which activates the ring for substitution at the ortho and para positions. However, since bromine is already at position 1, substitution occurs at this position, leading to the formation of 1-amino-2-deutero benzene.

4. **Elimination Reaction**: For elimination to occur, two adjacent leaving groups are typically required to form an aryne intermediate. In this case, bromine and deuterium are adjacent, but deuterium is not a leaving group. Therefore, elimination is not feasible.

5. **Possible Products**: The reaction does not involve multiple substitution sites or stereochemical outcomes because the bromine is the only leaving group, and substitution occurs exclusively at position 1. Thus, only one product, 1-amino-2-deutero benzene, is formed.

6. **Conclusion**: The reaction yields a single organic product.
