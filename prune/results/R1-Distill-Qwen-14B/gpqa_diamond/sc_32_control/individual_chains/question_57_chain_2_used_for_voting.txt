Okay, so I've got this physics problem about scattering amplitudes, and I'm a bit rusty on this topic. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question gives me phase shifts for an elastic scattering experiment of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The phase shifts provided are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. They also say to ignore the rest of the phase shifts. The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Hmm, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all the phase shifts. The formula I think is f(θ) equals the sum from l=0 to infinity of ( (2l + 1) / (2k) ) * (sin δ_l / (sin θ)) )^something. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up with something else. Oh right, the general form is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ) ). Wait, no, perhaps it's f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum ( (2l+1) [sin δ_l / (sin θ)] ) ... Hmm, maybe I should look up the exact formula, but since I can't, I'll try to recall.

Wait, another approach: The scattering amplitude for each partial wave is (e^{2iδ_l} -1)/(2ik), where k is the wave number. But the total amplitude is the sum of all the partial waves. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, the imaginary part of the amplitude might relate to the sum of the phase shifts in some way. 

Wait, I think the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude f(θ) along the direction of the incident beam (θ=0) is given by the sum of (2l + 1) times the phase shift δ_l for each l, but I might be mixing up the exact expression. Let me think again. 

Oh wait, for the forward direction (θ=0), the sum over l of (2l+1) times (e^{iδ_l} - 1) would contribute, but I might have to consider the sine terms. Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of the amplitude is (1/(2k)) multiplied by the sum of (2l + 1) times sin(δ_l). Because when θ=0, sin(lθ) is zero for all l>0, but wait, no, θ=0, so for l=0, sin(0)=0, but wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong.

Wait, another approach. The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) [e^{i δ_l} sin(l θ) ]

Then, the imaginary part of f(θ) would be Im[f(θ)] = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) [ sin(δ_l) sin(l θ) - cos(δ_l) cos(l θ) ] / 2 ?

Wait, perhaps I should think of e^{i δ_l} as cos(δ_l) + i sin(δ_l). So when we multiply by sin(lθ), the imaginary part becomes [ (2l + 1)/(2k) ) ( sin(δ_l) sin(lθ) + cos(δ_l) cos(lθ) ) ] ?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me write it out:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l) * sin(lθ) ) ]

So breaking that into real and imaginary parts:

Real part: (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) cos δ_l sin(lθ)
Imaginary part: (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l sin(lθ)

Wait, but 1/(2ik) is the same as -i/(2k), since 1/i is -i.

So, f(θ) = ( sum (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin(lθ) ] ) / (2ik) ) + i ( sum (2l+1) [ sin δ_l sin(lθ) ] ) / (2k) )

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the imaginary part of f(θ) as being (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l sin(lθ) ), because the 'i' would come from the denominator.

But wait, when θ is 0, sin(lθ) becomes 0 for all l>0. So for θ=0, each term with l>0 will contribute zero. Only l=0 term remains. Let's see:

For l=0, sin(0)=0, but wait, the term is (2l+1)=1, and sin(0θ)=0. So f(0) would only have the l=0 term, but wait, sin(0) is 0, so f(0) would be zero? That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong. Another possibility is that for the forward direction, the amplitude's imaginary part is just the sum of (2l + 1) times the phase shifts δ_l. Or maybe it's the sum of sin(δ_l) times (2l+1), multiplied by some factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of the amplitude is given by (1/(2k)) sum (2l +1) sin(δ_l), since when θ=0, the sin(lθ) terms are zero except for l=0 which is sin(0)=0. So I'm confused.

Wait, maybe I should think about the partial wave expansion. The scattering amplitude f(θ) can be written as:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) f_l (θ)

where f_l(θ) = [ e^{2i δ_l} - 1 ] / (2ik) * (sin δ_l / sin θ) )

Wait, no, perhaps another approach: The partial wave amplitude is f_l = (e^{2iδ_l} - 1)/(2ik). So the scattering amplitude is the sum over l of (2l+1) f_l P_l(cosθ), where P_l is the Legendre polynomial. But wait, maybe that's for the partial wave expansion.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the optical theorem. The imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude (θ=0) is related to the total cross-section. But the question isn't about the cross-section, it's directly asking for the imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by (1/(2k)) sum (2l +1) sin δ_l. Let me see why.

Because when θ=0, any term with l>0 has sin(lθ) = 0, so the only term that contributes is l=0, but for l=0, sin(0) is zero. So that can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{i δ_l} - 1 ] * sin lθ / sin θ. Wait, for θ=0, sinθ is zero, so perhaps we can take the limit as θ approaches zero.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Maybe another approach: perhaps the imaginary part of the amplitude at θ=0 is the sum of (2l + 1) times δ_l, multiplied by some factor.

Wait, the problem provides phase shifts δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°, and others are ignored. So perhaps I only need to consider l=0 to l=4.

Wait, when I'm considering the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, perhaps it's given by the sum over l of (2l + 1) sin δ_l times some factor.

Alternatively, I recall that the real part of the amplitude comes from Re[e^{i δ_l}] = cos δ_l, and the imaginary part comes from Im[e^{i δ_l}] = sin δ_l.

So, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ) / sin θ.

Wait, but for θ=0, sinθ is 0, so perhaps we can expand around θ=0.

Alternatively, perhaps the scattering amplitude's imaginary part at θ=0 is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

But wait, I'm not entirely confident. Let me think of a reference formula.

Another way: The scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^{∞} (2l +1) [ e^{i δ_l} (sin lθ) / sin θ ]

In the forward direction, θ = 0. So sin lθ = 0 for any l>0, but for l=0, sin(0)=0 as well. So this would imply f(0)=0, which can't be correct because the cross-section wouldn't vanish. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should be using the limit as θ approaches zero, since θ=0 is problematic. So, taking θ→0, sinθ ≈ θ (in radians). Then, sin lθ ≈ lθ. So, the term becomes (e^{i δ_l} lθ ) / θ ) = e^{i δ_l} l. So, f(θ) ≈ (1/(2ik)) sum (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} l.

Wait, then as θ approaches zero, the amplitude becomes f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} l.

But wait, (2l +1) l is l (2l +1). Hmm, but maybe this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of f(0) is given by (1/(2k)) sum (2l + 1) sin δ_l.

Because, when you expand f(θ) as θ approaches zero, the denominator sin θ ~ θ, and the numerator sin lθ ~ l θ. So the ratio sin lθ / sin θ ~ l. Then, f(θ) ~ (1/(2ik)) sum (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} l.

So, the imaginary part would be Im[f(θ)] ≈ (1/(2k)) sum (2l +1) sin δ_l l. Because e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l, so the imaginary part is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l l) / (2k).

Wait, but in the problem statement, the phase shifts are given as δ₀, δ₁, etc. So for each l, we have δ_l.

So, the formula for Im[f(0)] would be (1/(2k)) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l +1) l sin δ_l. Because the higher l's are ignored beyond l=4.

Wait, but wait, l=0: when l=0, (2l+1) is 1, and l is 0. So that term would be 0. So the sum would start from l=1.

So, let's compute each term for l=1 to 4.

Given:

δ₀=90° → sin(90°)=1, but l=0: (2*0 +1)*0 * sin(90°) = 0.

l=1: (2*1 +1) * 1 * sin(67°) → 3 * 1 * sin(67°)
l=2: 5 * 2 * sin(55°)
l=3: 7 * 3 * sin(30°)
l=4: 9 *4 * sin(13°)

Let me compute each term.

First, convert each phase shift from degrees to radians, but wait, since we're taking the sine, it's easier to just compute in degrees.

Compute each term:

l=1: 3 * 1 * sin(67°)
sin(67) ≈ 0.9205
3 * 0.9205 ≈ 2.7615

l=2: 5 * 2 * sin(55°)
sin(55) ≈ 0.8192
5 * 2 =10 → 10 * 0.8192 ≈ 8.192

l=3: 7 * 3 * sin(30°)
sin(30)=0.5 → 7*3=21 → 21 *0.5 =10.5

l=4:9 *4 * sin(13°)
sin(13°)≈0.22495
9*4=36 → 36 * 0.22495 ≈ 8.108

Now sum these:

2.7615 + 8.192 = 10.9535
10.9535 +10.5=21.4535
21.4535+8.108=29.5615

So the sum is approximately 29.5615.

Now, the factor is (1/(2k)). So I need to compute k, the wave number.

The electrons have energy 50 MeV. For electrons, the mass m_e is about 0.511 MeV/c².

The kinetic energy K is given as 50 MeV, so the total energy E = K =50 MeV, assuming they're non-relativistic? Wait, no, 50 MeV is a lot for electrons; they are ultra-relativistic. So perhaps the relativistic formula should be used.

The wave number k for a particle is given by k = sqrt(2m E) / ħ, but that's for non-relativistic. Alternatively, in natural units (where ħ= c=1), the energy E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 )

But perhaps it's easier to compute using the relativistic relation.

Alternatively, since the electrons are highly energetic (50 MeV is much bigger than m_e c², which is about 0.511 MeV), we can approximate k as E/(ħ c).

In natural units (ħ=1, c=1), the energy E is 50 MeV, so the wave number k is E/(ħ c) = E (in MeV) * c / ħ. Wait, maybe better to use the formula:

k = (E)/(ħ c) * sqrt(1 + (m c²)/(E)) )

But since E>>m c², the sqrt term approaches 1, so k ≈ E/(ħ c). 

But I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. Alternatively, for high-energy (ultra-relativistic) electrons, the relation between energy and momentum is E = pc, so p = E/c.

The wave number k is given by p/(ħ). So p = E/c → k = E/(c ħ) → let's compute that.

But let's get all the constants right.

ħ (h-bar) is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm (since h is about 4.135667696×10^-15 eV·s, but I'll use the value in MeV·fm: Planck constant h is 6.62607015e-34 J·s, which converts to eV·s as 6.62607015e-34 * 8.617333262e8 eV·s. So h ≈ 5.7e-25 eV·s. But I'm getting stuck, perhaps better to use known constants.

Wait, I remember that ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, for E=50 MeV,

k = E/(ħ c) → 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) ≈ 50 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So 1/(2k) is 1/(2 * 0.253) ≈ 1/0.506 ≈ 1.976 fm.

Wait, because 2k is about 0.506 fm⁻¹, so 1/(2k) is approximately 1.976 fm.

So, now the imaginary part of f(θ=0) is (sum) * (1/(2k)).

The sum is approximately 29.5615, and 1/(2k) is about 1.976 fm.

So Im[f(0)] ≈ 29.5615 * 1.976 fm.

Let me compute that:

29.5615 * 1.976 ≈ ?

Let me compute 30 * 2 =60, but it's 29.56*1.976:

Approximately:

29.56 * 2 =59.12. But since 1.976 is a bit less than 2, subtract 29.56 *0.024.

29.56 *0.024 ≈ 0.70944.

So 59.12 - 0.70944 ≈ 58.41 fm.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the options are of the order of tens of fm. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, let me compute 29.5615 * 1.976 precisely.

Compute 29.5615 * 2 = 59.123.

Now, 1.976 is 2 - 0.024. So,

29.5615 * 1.976 = 29.5615 * (2 -0.024) = 59.123 - (29.5615 * 0.024).

29.5615 *0.024 = (29.5615 * 0.02) + (29.5615 *0.004) => 0.59123 + 0.118246 = 0.709476.

So 59.123 - 0.709476 = 58.4135 fm.

Hmm, but the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Wait, 58.41 fm is not among the options. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the imaginary part. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by (1/(2k)) sum (2l +1) sin δ_l.

Because, in the formula f(θ)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ)/sinθ.

At θ=0, perhaps the amplitude is treated using a limit, and the leading term is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} l.

Because when θ approaches 0, sinθ ~ θ, and sin(lθ) ~ lθ, so the ratio is l. So f(θ) ≈ (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} l.

Taking the imaginary part of this would be Im[ (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} l ].

Which is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) l sin δ_l.

Because e^{iδ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l, so when multiplied by (2l+1) l, the imaginary part comes from the sin δ_l term.

So then, Im[f(0)] = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) l sin δ_l.

Which is what I did earlier. So the sum is 29.5615, and 1/(2k) is around 1.976 fm.

So Im[f] ≈ 29.5615 * 1.976 ≈58.41 fm.

But this isn't matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, let me recompute the sum term by term.

l=1: (2*1 +1) * 1 * sin(67°) =3 *1 *0.9205 ≈2.7615

l=2: (2*2+1)*2 * sin(55) =5 *2 *0.8192=10 *0.8192=8.192

l=3: (7)*3 * sin(30) =7*3*0.5 = 10.5

l=4: (9)*4 * sin(13) =9*4*0.22495=36 *0.22495≈8.108

Sum: 2.7615 +8.192 =10.9535 +10.5=21.4535 +8.108=29.5615.

Hmm, that's correct. So Im[f]=29.5615 *1.976=58.41 fm.

But none of the options are near 58 fm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another possibility: perhaps the formula is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, without the 'l' factor.

Wait, let me try that. So:

sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

l=0: (1) * sin(90)=1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3 *0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5*0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9*0.22495≈2.02455.

Now sum these:

1 +2.7615=3.7615

+4.096 →7.8575

+3.5 →11.3575

+2.02455 →13.38205.

So sum is approximately 13.382.

Then, Im[f] = (1/(2k)) * sum → 13.382 * 1.976.

13.382 *1.976 ≈ ?

13 *2=26. 0.382 *2=0.764. So 26 +0.764=26.764. But since 1.976 is 2 -0.024, perhaps a more accurate approach:

13.382 *1.976 = 13.382*(2 -0.024) =26.764 - (13.382 *0.024).

13.382 *0.024 =0.321168.

So 26.764−0.321168≈26.4428.

So Im[f] ≈26.44 fm.

Still not matching any options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l + l π/2), but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the contribution for each l is (2l+1) times δ_l in radians, but that seems odd.

Wait, perhaps I should convert the phase shifts from degrees to radians before computing the sine.

Wait, I think I have been using degrees for sine, but perhaps I should convert to radians.

Wait, let's see:

sin(67 degrees) = sin(67 * pi/180) ≈ sin(1.16937 radians) ≈0.9205 (same as before).

So that's correct. So no change.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula for Im(f) is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1) )

But that would give a complex amplitude, and taking the imaginary part would require more steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing k.

Wait, calculating k again.

E =50 MeV.

For an electron, m_e c²=0.511 MeV.

Using the relativistic formula, the momentum p is given by E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c.

But in terms of wave number k = p/ħ.

But perhaps better to compute in units where ħ c=197.33 MeV·fm.

So, p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

In units where ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm,

p = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) / (c) → but since we're using ħ c in MeV·fm, perhaps p is in MeV/(c) × fm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute k as:

k = (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^(1/2) / (ħ c^2)

But I'm getting stuck. Let me compute it step by step.

E =50 MeV.

m_e c² = 0.511 MeV.

p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m_e c²)^2 ) = sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2) ≈ sqrt(2500 -0.261) ≈ sqrt(2499.739) ≈49.997 MeV.

So p = (49.997 MeV) / c.

Then, k = p / ħ.

But ħ c =197.33 MeV·fm, so ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm)/c.

So, p =49.997 MeV/c → k = (49.997 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm / c ) ).

The c's cancel, and MeV cancels, leaving:

k = 49.997 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

So 1/(2k) is about 1/(2 *0.253) ≈ 1.976 fm.

Same as before. So that part seems correct.

Hmm. So if the formula is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) l sin δ_l, the result is about 58.4 fm, which doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, which gives 26.4 fm, still not matching.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 251.271 fm. Hmm, 251 is about 4 *63, which is close to 4*60=240. So perhaps I made a mistake in the factor.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the wave number k is not 0.253 fm⁻¹, but perhaps I messed up the units.

Wait, wait a second. Let me recalculate k correctly.

k is given by the formula:

k = sqrt( (2mE) ) / ħ → but this is the non-relativistic formula, which isn't applicable here since E=50 MeV is much larger than m_e c²=0.511 MeV.

So, the correct relativistic approach is:

E² = (pc)² + (mc²)² → p = sqrt(E² - (mc²)^2 ) / c.

Then, k = p / ħ.

But, since ħ c =197.33 MeV·fm, so ħ =197.33 MeV·fm /c.

Thus,

p = (50 MeV / c ) → but wait, wait, the actual value is:

p = sqrt(50² -0.511²) / c → approximately 50 MeV/c.

So, k = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm/c) ) → the c's cancel, MeV cancels, so 50/(197.33) fm⁻¹ → approximately 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Same as before. So, 1/(2k) is 1.976 fm.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the answer options. The options are A) 87,163 fm, which is way too big, B) 355 fm, C)177.675 fm, D)251.271 fm.

Wait, perhaps I did a miscalculation in the sum. Let me recompute the sum with the formula (2l+1) * l sin δ_l.

l=1: 3 *1 * sin(67) →3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 *2 * sin(55) →10 *0.8192=8.192.

l=3:7 *3 *0.5=10.5.

l=4:9 *4 * sin(13) →36 *0.22495≈8.108.

Sum:2.7615 +8.192=10.9535 +10.5=21.4535 +8.108=29.5615.

So sum is 29.5615.

Multiply by 1.976 →29.5615 *1.976 ≈58.41 fm.

Hmm. Not matching any options.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the formula is (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, so sum is 13.382, 13.382 *1.976≈26.44 fm. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula for Im[f(0)]. Another possibility: the total cross-section is given by (4π/k²) Im[f(0)], but the question isn't about cross-section.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l}.

But then, Im[f(0)] would be (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would lead to sum 13.382, multiplied by 1.976 gives 26.44 fm. Still no match.

Wait, perhaps I have the factor wrong. What if the formula is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l. So for our sum 13.382, 13.382 * (1/k) with k=0.253 fm⁻¹.

1/k ≈3.9526 fm.

13.382 *3.9526 ≈52.9 fm. Still not matching.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the wave number k is larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relativistic formula for the wave number.

In natural units (c=1, ħ=1), E = sqrt( p^2 + m^2 ). So, p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 ) = sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2) ≈50 MeV.

So, k = p / ħ → but in natural units where ħ=197.33 MeV·fm, so:

k = (50 MeV) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) →50/197.33 ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

Same as before. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im[f] is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l).

Because sometimes phase shifts are defined with a 2. But I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, without the 1/(2k) factor. Let's see.

Sum is 13.382, so 13.382 * (1/(2k)) → but 1/(2k)=1.976.

13.382 *1.976=26.44 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, not degrees. Oh! Wait a minute, that's a possibility. Because in the formula for sine, the angle should be in radians.

Wait, but the question gives the phase shifts in degrees, like δ₀=90°, etc. So perhaps the correct approach is to convert the phase shifts to radians before taking the sine.

So, let's recompute each term with δ in radians.

l=1:

δ=67° → 67* pi/180 ≈1.16937 radians.

sin(1.16937)=0.9205 (same as before). So no change.

Similarly, 55° →0.95993 radians, sin is same.

30° →0.5236 rad, sin is 0.5.

13°→0.22689 rad, sin≈0.22495.

So no change in the sum. So the same result.

Hmm. I'm stuck.

Another approach: perhaps the question is asking about the imaginary part of the total scattering amplitude, not per unit solid angle or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the sum should include all the phase shifts up to l=4.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for Im[f] is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1).

Because e^{i δ_l} -1 = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l -1.

So Im part would be (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Then, sum is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, as before.

So same result.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the answer is 251.271 fm, which is option D. How could that be?

Let me compute (2l+1) * l * sin δ_l for each l, sum them, and multiply by 1/(2k).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum. Let me recalculate.

l=1: 3 *1 * sin(67) →3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 *2 * sin(55) →10 *0.8192=8.192.

l=3:7 *3 *0.5=10.5.

l=4:9 *4 * sin(13)→36 *0.22495=8.108.

Sum:2.7615 +8.192=10.9535 +10.5=21.4535 +8.108=29.5615.

Hmm, correct.

Wait, but maybe I should include l=0, even though l=0 term is zero. So,

sum =0 +29.5615=29.5615.

Multiply by 1/(2k)=1.976 →29.5615 *1.976≈58.41 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, but 58.41 is not any of the options. Now I'm really confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the sum is (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [e^{i δ_l} -1 ].

Which would give Im[f] = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which gives sum 13.382 →13.382 *1.976=26.44 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the wave number k is different. What if I made a mistake in calculating k?

Wait, another way to compute k: in natural units where ħ=1, c=1, E=50 MeV.

Then, k = sqrt( (E)^2 - (m)^2 ) → E=50 MeV, m=0.511 MeV.

So, k= sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2) ≈50 MeV.

But since in natural units, ħ=1, so k in units of MeV⁻¹ (since ħ is 1, and k has units of 1/length, which is inverse fm).

Wait, but I might have messed up the units. Alternatively, perhaps k is approximately 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) → same as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the options.

Option D is 251.271 fm. Let's see what that would require.

If Im[f] =251.271 fm,

then,

sum (2l+1) l sin δ_l = Im[f] * 2k.

Im[f] =251.271 fm → 251.271 *2k = sum.

But 2k ≈0.506 fm⁻¹.

So sum ≈251.271 *0.506 ≈126.866 fm⁻¹ * fm → dimensionless? Wait, no, units are getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should think of sum (2l+1) l sin δ_l = Im[f(0)] * (2k).

Given that Im[f(0)] is in fm, and k is in fm⁻¹, 2k is in fm⁻¹.

So sum would have units fm⁻¹ * fm = dimensionless? No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im[f(0)] = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) l sin δ_l.

So, sum (2l+1) l sin δ_l = Im[f] * 2k.

So,

sum = Im[f] * 2k.

If Im[f] is option D, 251.271 fm,

sum = 251.271 fm * 2 *0.253 fm⁻¹ →251.271 *0.506 ≈126.866.

But previously I calculated sum as 29.5615, which is much less than 126.

So, that can't be.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that we should ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond l=4. So perhaps higher l's are being considered, but in the problem, only δ₀ to δ₄ are given.

Wait, no, the problem says "ignore rest of the phase shifts", so only l=0 to 4 are considered.

Another thought: Perhaps the question is referring to the imaginary part of the amplitude multiplied by k.

Wait, but even then, I don't see how to get the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So sum is13.382, 13.382 * (1/k) →13.382 *3.9526 ≈52.9 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, option B is 355.351 fm. Which is about 6 times 58.4fm. So perhaps I missed a factor of 6.

Wait, but where would a factor of 6 come in?

Hmm, perhaps the formula is (2l+1) sin δ_l, but multiplied by something else.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l}.

But then, the imaginary part would be (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which gives 13.382 *1.976=26.44 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the total cross-section, which would be (4π/k²) Im[f(0)].

But the question specifically asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, so that's not it.

Another possibility: Maybe I should use the sum for all l, including l=0. But for l=0, (2l+1) is 1, l=0, so the term is zero. So no change.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l (something).

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the scattering amplitude as f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) (e^{2i δ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ), where P_l is the Legendre polynomial. But for θ=0, P_l(1)=1 for all l, so f(0)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1)(e^{2i δ_l} -1).

So Im[f(0)] is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

Wait, that's a new approach. Let me try that.

So, Im[f(0)] = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l).

Now, compute sin(2δ_l) for each l.

l=0: δ=90° → 2*90=180°, sin(180)=0.

l=1: 67*2=134° → sin(134)=sin(180-46)=sin46≈0.7193.

l=2:55*2=110° → sin(110)=sin(180-70)=sin70≈0.9397.

l=3:30*2=60° → sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660.

l=4:13*2=26° → sin(26)=0.4384.

Now, compute each term (2l+1)* sin(2δ_l):

l=0:1 *0=0.

l=1:3 *0.7193≈2.1579.

l=2:5 *0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:7 *0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum: 2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

Now, Im[f(0)] = (1/(2k)) *16.864.

With 1/(2k)=1.976 fm,

Im[f(0)]=16.864 *1.976 ≈33.28 fm.

Still not matching any options.

I think I'm stuck. Since none of my attempts to get the sum matching the options are working, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach and should try to find another way.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 177.675 fm, which is about 2 times 88.8375.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) 2 sin δ_l, which would be 2 times the previous sum.

But why would it be 2 times? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1).

Which would give:

Im part is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which for sum 13.382, gives 26.44 fm.

Still no match.

Wait, option D is 251.271 fm. Let me compute this:

251.271 = (sum of (2l+1) l sin δ_l) * (1/(2k)).

So,

sum = 251.271 * 2k.

k=0.253 fm⁻¹ → 2k=0.506 fm⁻¹.

sum =251.271 *0.506 ≈126.866.

But earlier sum was 29.56, so this would require phase shifts leading to a sum of 126, which is much higher than what we have.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the formula is (1/(k)) sum (2l+1) l sin δ_l.

Then, Im[f]= (1/k) *29.5615.

1/k≈3.9526 fm.

So, 29.5615 *3.9526 ≈116.8 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l}.

Imaginary part is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which gives 13.382 *1.976=26.44 fm.

No match.

Hmm, I'm running out of ideas. Maybe I should look at the possible options and see if any align with another approach.

Wait, the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm → way too big.

B) 355.351 fm.

C)177.675 fm.

D)251.271 fm.

Wait, option C is about 177.675 fm.

Which is exactly half of 355.351 (option B).

Hmm. Perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be (2l+1) sin δ_l, not multiplied by l.

So the sum is 13.382.

Then, Im[f]=13.382 *1.976=26.44 fm.

No.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the wave number k is 0.253 fm⁻¹, but 1/(2k) is 1.976 fm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula requires 1/k, which is about 3.9526 fm.

So, perhaps the sum is 29.5615, multiplied by 3.9526 →29.56 *3.9526≈116.8 fm.

Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (1/(k^2)) sum (2l+1) l sin δ_l.

k=0.253 fm⁻¹ → k^2=0.064 (fm⁻²).

sum=29.5615.

29.5615 /0.064 ≈461.9 fm². Still not matching.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct approach is to give up and choose the closest option, but given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make a guess.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} ), which includes the exponential. The imaginary part would be (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which gives 13.382 *1.976=26.44 fm.

But that's not among the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct sum is (2l+1) * sin(δ_l) * (2l+1).

Which would be (2l+1)^2 sin δ_l.

Let me compute that.

l=0:1^2 *1=1.

l=1:3^2 *0.9205=9 *0.9205=8.2845.

l=2:5^2 *0.8192=25 *0.8192=20.48.

l=3:7^2 *0.5=49 *0.5=24.5.

l=4:9^2 *0.22495=81 *0.22495≈18.25.

Sum:1 +8.2845=9.2845 +20.48=30.7645 +24.5=55.2645 +18.25=73.5145.

Im[f]=73.5145 *1.976≈145.8 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by (1/(k)).

Which would give 13.382 *3.9526 ≈52.9 fm.

No match.

I think I've tried all possibilities. Perhaps the intended approach was to compute the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, multiply by 1/(2k), leading to ~26.44 fm, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 177.675 fm.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the sum earlier. Let me recheck.

Wait, wait a minute! I think I made a mistake in the formula. The correct formula for the scattering amplitude's imaginary part at θ=0 is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l). Because for θ=0, the terms involving sin(lθ) are zero, except when l=0, but for l=0, sin(0)=0. So perhaps the correct formula is to sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, multiplied by (1/(2k)).

Wait, but earlier that led to sum 13.382 and Im[f]=26.44.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the given phase shifts are for higher l, but I'm summing from l=0 to 4. But the question says to ignore the rest, which implies we should include all given phase shifts, which are δ₀ to δ₄.

Wait, perhaps I should also include l=0, even though the term is zero.

Hmm, no change.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in degrees, but in radians, but my calculation was correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply by 2 instead of 1/(2k), but that would give 29.5615 * (1/k) =29.5615 *3.9526≈116.8 fm.

Still no match.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possible approaches, and the correct answer isn't matching any of the calculated options. But perhaps the intended approach was to compute the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l and multiply by 1/(2k), leading to 26.44 fm. Since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 177.675 fm.

Wait, 177.675 is approximately twice 88.8375, which is close to 29.56 *3. So perhaps I should have multiplied by 3.

Wait, 29.5615 * 6=177.369, which is close to option C: 177.675 fm.

So perhaps the correct formula is sum (2l+1)* l* sin δ_l multiplied by 3. So 29.5615 *3=88.6845, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct factor is (1/k) instead of (1/(2k)), leading to Im[f] =29.5615 *3.9526≈116.8 fm. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply by (1/k^2), but that would give unit inconsistency.

I think I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess based on the calculations. Since none of the options match my results, I might have made a mistake in the approach, but based on the sum of (2l+1)* l* sin δ_l being 29.5615, and 1/(2k)=1.976, leading to 58.41 fm, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option D:251.271 fm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should consider that the wave number k is 50 MeV divided by (ħ c), but perhaps I should use E=50 MeV, and compute k as E/(ħ c).

But ħ c=197.33 MeV·fm.

So, k=50/197.33 ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

Same as before.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll conclude that the correct answer is option C: 177.675 fm.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at the forward direction (θ = 0) for elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The phase shifts provided are δ₀ = 90°, δ₁ = 67°, δ₂ = 55°, δ₃ = 30°, and δ₄ = 13°, with all higher-order phase shifts ignored. The goal is to determine the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude using the given options.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Scattering Amplitude Formula**:  
   The scattering amplitude \( f(\theta) \) is expressed as:
   \[
   f(\theta) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) e^{i\delta_l} \sin(l\theta),
   \]
   where \( k \) is the wave number, and \( \delta_l \) are the phase shifts. For the forward direction (\( \theta = 0 \)), the terms involving \( \sin(l\theta) \) vanish for \( l > 0 \), leaving only the \( l = 0 \) term. However, \( \sin(0) = 0 \), so the forward scattering amplitude requires a different approach.

2. **Imaginary Part of \( f(0) \)**:  
   The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at \( \theta = 0 \) is proportional to:
   \[
   \text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) \sin(\delta_l).
   \]
   Since higher-order phase shifts beyond \( l = 4 \) are ignored, the sum is truncated at \( l = 4 \).

3. **Wave Number \( k \)**:  
   The wave number \( k \) is calculated using the relativistic relation:
   \[
   k = \frac{E}{\hbar c},
   \]
   where \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \), \( \hbar c = 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm} \), and \( m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \). Substituting, \( k \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1} \). Thus, \( 1/(2k) \approx 1.976 \, \text{fm} \).

4. **Sum of Terms**:  
   The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude involves the sum:
   \[
   \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1) \sin(\delta_l).
   \]
   Converting phase shifts to radians and calculating each term:
   - \( l = 0 \): \( (2(0) + 1) \sin(90^\circ) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \),
   - \( l = 1 \): \( (2(1) + 1) \sin(67^\circ) \approx 3 \cdot 0.9205 = 2.7615 \),
   - \( l = 2 \): \( (2(2) + 1) \sin(55^\circ) \approx 5 \cdot 0.8192 = 4.096 \),
   - \( l = 3 \): \( (2(3) + 1) \sin(30^\circ) \approx 7 \cdot 0.5 = 3.5 \),
   - \( l = 4 \): \( (2(4) + 1) \sin(13^\circ) \approx 9 \cdot 0.22495 = 2.02455 \).

   Summing these contributions:
   \[
   \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1) \sin(\delta_l) \approx 1 + 2.7615 + 4.096 + 3.5 + 2.02455 \approx 13.382.
   \]

5. **Final Calculation**:  
   Substituting into the formula for \( \text{Im}[f(0)] \):
   \[
   \text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1) \sin(\delta_l) \approx 13.382 \cdot 1.976 \approx 26.44 \, \text{fm}.
   \]

6. **Mismatch with Options**:  
   The calculated value of \( 26.44 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. After extensive re-evaluation of the formula, phase shifts, and constants, it remains unclear why the calculated value does not align with the options. However, based on the structure of the problem and the closest match to the calculations, **option C (177.675 fm)** is selected as the most plausible answer.

### Conclusion:
While the detailed calculations yield \( \text{Im}[f(0)] \approx 26.44 \, \text{fm} \), none of the options match this result. Given the provided options and the reasoning process, the best choice is:

**Answer: C**
