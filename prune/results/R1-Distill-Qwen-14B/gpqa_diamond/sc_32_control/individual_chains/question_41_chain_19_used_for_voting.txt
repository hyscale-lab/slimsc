Alright, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Okay, so a light beam is moving through glass with an index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and it's moving towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking, what's the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab?

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with light and moving media, we have to consider the principles of special relativity, particularly the invariance of the speed of light. Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact approach here. Let me think.

So the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is propagating through the glass, which implies that the glass's movement affects the observed speed of light. But wait, according to Einstein's theory, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, regardless of the source's motion. But here the light isn't in a vacuum; it's in a medium (glass) that's moving.

Wait, but the speed of light in a medium is given by v_medium = c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n is c divided by the medium's speed. So when the medium is stationary, the light's speed is c/n. But what if the medium is moving?

I think this is where the addition of velocities comes into play. Because the glass is moving, we might need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Wait, but wait—velocity addition in relativity applies when you have different inertial frames. So perhaps I should model the glass as a frame moving at velocity v relative to the lab, and then find the speed of light in that frame, then transform back to the lab frame.

Alternatively, maybe it's simpler. Let me break it down.

In the rest frame of the glass (S'), the light is moving with speed v_light' = c/n. Because in the glass's frame, the light's speed is c/n. Now, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab (S frame). So we need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame.

Wait, but if the glass is moving towards the observer, then in the lab frame, the light's speed would be affected by the relative motion of the medium. So I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The standard relativistic velocity addition formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/c²), where u' is the velocity in the moving frame (S'), and u is the velocity in the lab frame (S). But wait, in this case, the direction is important. Since the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass (towards the observer), I should make sure the signs are correct.

In S', the frame of the glass, the light is moving with speed u' = c/n. Let's say the direction is along the positive x-axis. So in S', the light's velocity is u' = c/n in the positive x direction. Now, the glass is moving at velocity v in the positive x direction relative to the lab. So to find the lab's measurement (u), we apply the velocity addition formula.

Plugging into the formula:
u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/c² )

Substituting u' = c/n:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Let me simplify the denominator. (c/n * v ) / c² = (v)/(n c). So denominator becomes 1 + (v)/(n c).

So u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v )/(n c) ) ]

Wait, let me compute the denominator correctly. 1 + (v)/(n c) is equal to (n c + v)/(n c). So the entire expression becomes:

u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ] 

Which is the same as multiplying numerator and denominator. So:

u = [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ (n c)/(n c + v) ) ]

Simplify this:

The numerator becomes (c + n v) * n c / n = (c + n v) * c.

Denominator is (n c + v) * 1.

Wait, wait. Let me re-calculate:

Wait, no, the denominator is (n c + v), because the denominator in the second fraction after inversion is (n c + v)/(n c), so when you flip it, it becomes (n c)/(n c + v). So the entire expression is:

[ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n in the denominator and the n c in the numerator will cancel the n in the denominator. So, that leaves:

(c + n v) * c / (n c + v)

Wait, wait, no: Let me recompute:

Multiply numerator: (c + n v) * n c

Multiply denominator: n * (n c + v)

Wait, no, wait: Let me clarify each step again.

The initial expression after substitution is:

u = [ ( c/n + v ) ] / [ 1 + (v * (c/n) ) / c² ]

Which can be rewritten as:

u = ( (c + n v ) / n ) / ( 1 + (v)/(n c) )

Which is:

u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v )/(n c) ) ]

Because 1 + (v)/(n c) = (n c + v)/(n c).

Now, dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So:

u = [ (c + n v) / n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

So the n in the numerator of the second fraction cancels with the denominator of the first fraction.

So now, u = (c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

Wait, that's correct. So u = [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

Wait, but the options given are in terms of n and v. Let me factor the denominator.

Denominator is n c + v. Hmm. The numerator is c^2 + c n v.

Wait, let me write u as:

u = [ c(c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

Hmm, is there any way to factor this further? Let me see.

Wait, perhaps factor the denominator:

n c + v = v + n c.

Not much else to do. Let me see what the options are.

Looking at the options, option B is 1, but that would only be the case if u = c. But according to the expression, unless the denominator equals the numerator. Let me check for that.

But wait, the expression I have is [ c(c + n v) ] / (n c + v ). Let me factor the denominator and numerator.

Wait, the denominator is n c + v = v( n (c/v) + 1 ), but that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out c from denominator and numerator.

Wait, let's see:

u = [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

= c (c + n v) / (n c + v )

Hmm. Let me consider whether I can write it as (1 + n (v/c )) / (n + (v/c)) ) multiplied by c.

Wait, let me divide numerator and denominator by c:

u = [ (c + n v)/c ] * c / [ (n c + v)/c ) ]

= [ (1 + (n v)/(c) ) ] * [ c^2 / (n c + v) ) ]

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor c from denominator:

n c + v = c (n + v/c )

So:

u = c (c + n v) / ( c (n + v/c ) )

The c's cancel, so:

u = (c + n v) / (n + v/c )

Wait, but this seems a bit more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor n from the numerator.

Wait, let me think about the options again.

Option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v ), but that's without the c's. Wait, but in the problem statement, c is given as 1. Oh, right! Because the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1. So in this problem, c is taken as 1. So all the c's in my equations should be replaced with 1.

Ah, that's a crucial point. So let's redo the calculation with c=1.

In that case, the speed in the glass is c/n = 1/n. The S' frame (glass) has light moving at 1/n.

So, applying the velocity addition formula again:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' v )

Since c=1, the formula becomes u = (u' + v)/(1 + u' v )

With u' = 1/n.

So substituting:

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) v )

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: ( 1 + n v ) / n

Denominator: (n + v ) / n

So u becomes:

[(1 + n v)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ) ] 

Which is equal to (1 + n v)/n * n/(n + v) )

The n's cancel out, so u = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Wait, that's option A: (1 + n v)/(n + v )

But wait, let me make sure I did everything correctly.

Wait, in the velocity addition formula, the denominator is 1 + (u' * v). Since c=1, it's 1 + (1/n) * v.

So yes, the denominator becomes (n + v)/n.

So the entire expression becomes:

( (1 + n v)/n ) / ( (n + v)/n ) ) = (1 + n v)/(n + v )

So the speed is (1 + n v)/(n + v )

Looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v ), so that's correct.

Wait, but wait a second. What about the direction of the velocity? Because the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So when the glass moves towards the observer, the light's speed relative to the lab would be higher than the speed in the glass, right? Because you add the velocities.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the speed is (1 +n v)/(n +v ). Let me plug in some numbers to see if this makes sense.

Suppose n=1, v is a small value, say v=0.1.

Then, the speed in glass when stationary is 1/1=1, but when the glass is moving at 0.1, the observed speed would be (1 + 1 * 0.1)/(1 + 0.1 ) = 1.1/1.1 = 1. That's correct because in relativity, adding a small velocity v to a light beam would not change its speed—it remains c=1.

Wait, but wait, in reality, when the medium is moving towards you, shouldn't the light appear to come at you faster than c/n? Let me think again.

Wait, in the case where the medium is moving towards you, the light's speed in the lab frame would be (c_medium + v_medium) / (1 + (c_medium * v_medium)/c² )

But c_medium is c/n, so:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Again, with c=1, it's ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (v)/(n) )

Which simplifies to:

( (1 + n v ) /n ) / ( (n + v)/n ) ) = (1 +n v)/(n +v )

So the calculation seems correct.

In the case where n=1 and v=0.5, then u would be (1 + 1 * 0.5)/(1 + 0.5) = 1.5/1.5 = 1.

Which again makes sense because the speed of light can't exceed c. Wait, but in another case, suppose v is very large, but that's not possible because in reality, v must be less than c. But according to the formula, when n is 1, u is (1 +v)/(1 +v )=1. So that's correct.

Wait another example: n=2, v=0.5.

Then, u = (1 + 2 *0.5 )/(2 + 0.5 )= (1 +1 )/(2.5 )= 2/2.5=0.8. Since c=1, 0.8 is less than 1, which is correct.

But wait, when the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction, does this formula correctly account for that?

Another way to think: when the medium is moving towards you, from your perspective, the light should appear to be approaching faster.

Wait, when the medium is moving towards you, and the light is moving in the same direction (towards you), then the light's speed as observed in the lab should be higher than (1/n). Let me see what the formula gives when v is positive, and in the same direction as the light.

Wait, for example, if n=1, v=0.5, then u=(1 +1*0.5)/(1+0.5)=1.5/1.5=1, which is correct.

But if the medium is moving towards you, and the light is moving in the opposite direction, but in the problem, the light is in the same direction as the medium's motion.

Wait, in the problem statement, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. So the glass's motion is towards the observer, and the light is moving towards the observer as well.

Wait, that can't be right—can the light be moving towards the observer while the glass is moving towards the observer? Or is the glass moving in the same direction as the light's propagation.

Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me re-read: "The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory."

Wait, same direction as the beam, which is moving towards the observer. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer in the same direction. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass (through which the beam is passing) is moving towards the observer as well.

In this case, from the lab frame, the glass is approaching, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass.

In that case, the light's speed as observed would be higher than when the glass is stationary. Because when the glass is moving towards you, and the light is moving towards you, you would expect the light's speed to increase beyond 1/n.

Wait, but according to the calculation, for n=2 and v=0.5, u=(1 +2*0.5)/(2+0.5 )= (2)/(2.5)=0.8. Since 1/n is 0.5, and in this case, the observed speed is 0.8, which is larger. So that makes sense.

Wait, but let's take another example where n=1 and v=0.6.

u=(1 +1*0.6)/(1 +0.6 )=1.6/1.6=1. So correct.

Another example: n=3, v=0.2.

u=(1 +3*0.2)/(3 +0.2 )= (1.6)/(3.2 )=0.5. Since 1/n=0.333..., 0.5 is higher, which makes sense.

So the formula seems to correctly capture the situation.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A.

To determine the speed of light in a moving glass medium relative to the observer in the laboratory, we apply the relativistic velocity addition formula. The glass has an index of refraction \( n \), and it is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, which is also moving toward the observer. The speed of light in a stationary glass medium is \( c/n \), where \( c = 1 \) (as given in the problem). 

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + u' v}
\]

where \( u' = c/n = 1/n \) is the speed of light in the glass in its rest frame, and \( u \) is the speed of light as observed in the lab frame. Substituting \( u' = 1/n \) into the formula:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}}
\]

The \( n \) in the numerator and denominator cancels out:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. To verify, consider specific cases:

1. If \( n = 1 \) and \( v = 0.1 \), the speed of light in the lab frame is:

\[
u = \frac{1 + 1 \cdot 0.1}{1 + 0.1} = \frac{1.1}{1.1} = 1
\]

which is consistent with the invariance of the speed of light.

2. If \( n = 2 \) and \( v = 0.5 \), the speed of light in the lab frame is:

\[
u = \frac{1 + 2 \cdot 0.5}{2 + 0.5} = \frac{2}{2.5} = 0.8
\]

which is greater than the speed of light in the stationary glass (\( 1/n = 0.5 \)), as expected when the medium moves toward the observer.

Thus, the formula correctly accounts for the relativistic effects and matches the given options.
