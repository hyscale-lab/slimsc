Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it carefully.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator whose matrix representation is given by Aij. The matrix Aij is such that Aij = ħ/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Also, I have to find the average value of that operator. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I think I should normalize the state |alpha> because it's given as proportional, not necessarily normalized. So the state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. To normalize, I'll compute the inner product with itself.

The inner product is <alpha|alpha> = |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2. Because |up> and |down> are orthonormal, their cross terms vanish. So calculating each modulus squared:

|1 + i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, (1+i) is a complex number. The modulus squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Similarly for (2 - i): modulus squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the total inner product is 2 +5 =7. So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Got it. So the state is defined as (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the operator in question has matrix elements Aij. Since |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of S_z (the z-component of spin), perhaps the operator we're dealing with is another spin component, maybe S_x or S_y, but the matrix form is given.

Wait, the matrix Aij is zero when i=j and ħ/2 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, A would look like:

[ 0, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 ]

Because when i != j, the elements are ħ/2. So for a spin-½ system, the Pauli matrices have similar structures. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this operator is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So the operator is A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

Wait, because the Pauli X matrix σ_x has elements 0,1; 1,0. So if Aij is ħ/2 for i≠j, then the matrix is (ħ/2) * σ_x. So the operator is A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

So the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of σ_x, which are the eigenstates of S_x. The eigenstates of S_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

The problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, and I need to find the probabilities of measuring the system in each.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, then the coefficients' squared magnitudes will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, since the operator is A = (ħ/2) σ_x, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. The expectation value would be <A> = (ħ/2) <sigma_x>.

But wait, the question asks for the probability of measuring each eigenstate, which would correspond to the eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues of A are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, so the probabilities would be |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2, where c_+ and c_- are the expansion coefficients of |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A.

So to find the probabilities, I need to find how |alpha> is expressed in terms of the eigenstates of A.

Alternatively, I can compute the expectation value and find the probabilities from that. Wait, because for a two-level system, if the probabilities are p and (1-p), then the expectation value is (prob of +) * (+ħ/2) + (prob of -) * (-ħ/2) ) = p*(ħ/2) - (1-p)*(ħ/2) ) = (2p -1)(ħ/2).

But perhaps it's easier to calculate the expectation value first and then find the probabilities based on that. Let's see.

First, let me compute the expectation value of A.

Since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, the expectation value <A> is (ħ/2) <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

Now, sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix. So for a state |psi> = a|up> + b|down>, the expectation value of sigma_x is (a* b + b* a ) times something. Wait, more accurately, the expectation value is 2 * Re(a b^*), because sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so <sigma_x> = 2 Re(a b^*).

Wait, let me compute it step by step. Let the state be |alpha> = c_up |up> + c_down |down>, where c_up = (1+i)/sqrt(7), c_down = (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

The expectation value of sigma_x is:

<sigma_x> = <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

sigma_x in the z-basis is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you compute the matrix product, you get:

<alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = (c_up^* c_down + c_down^* c_up) )

Which is (c_up^* c_down + c_down^* c_up) = 2 Re(c_up^* c_down).

So first compute c_up^* and c_down.

c_up = (1 + i)/sqrt(7), so c_up^* = (1 - i)/sqrt(7).

c_down = (2 - i)/sqrt(7), so c_down^* = (2 + i)/sqrt(7).

Now compute c_up^* c_down: (1 - i)(2 - i) / (7) = [ (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) ] /7.

Wait, let's compute numerator:

(1)(2) = 2.

(1)(-i) = -i.

(-i)(2) = -2i.

(-i)(-i) = i^2 = -1.

So sum: 2 -i -2i -1 = (2-1) + (-3i) = 1 -3i.

So c_up^* c_down = (1 -3i)/7.

Similarly, c_down^* c_up is [ (2 + i)(1 + i) ] /7.

Compute numerator:

(2)(1) = 2.

(2)(i) = 2i.

(i)(1) = i.

(i)(i) = i² = -1.

So sum: 2 +2i +i -1 = (2-1) + 3i = 1 +3i.

So c_down^* c_up = (1 +3i)/7.

Adding c_up^* c_down + c_down^* c_up: (1-3i +1+3i)/7 = (2)/7.

So <sigma_x> = 2*(2/7) = 4/7? Wait, no.

Wait, wait. Wait, sigma_x's expectation value is 2 Re(c_up^* c_down) = 2*(Re( (1 -3i)/7 )) = 2*(1/7) )= 2/7.

Wait, no. Wait, let me clarify. Because c_up^* c_down = (1 -3i)/7. The real part is (1)/7.

So 2 Re(c_up^* c_down) = 2*(1/7) = 2/7.

Wait, wait, but earlier when I added c_up^* c_down and c_down^* c_up, I got (1 -3i +1 +3i)/7 = 2/7. Which is the same as 2 Re(c_up^* c_down) because Re(z) + Re(z^*) = 2 Re(z). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, c_up^* c_down = (1 -i)(2 -i) = 2 -i -2i +i² = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i. So 1 -3i over 7.

c_down^* c_up = (2+i)(1+i) = 2(1) +2i +i(1) + i² = 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i. So over 7.

So when I add these two, (1-3i +1+3i)/7 = 2/7. So their sum is 2/7. Oh, but sigma_x's expectation value is this sum, because when you compute <sigma_x> = [c_up^* c_down + c_down^* c_up] = 2/7.

So <sigma_x> = 2/7.

Therefore, <A> = (ħ/2) * <sigma_x> = (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/(7).

So the average value is ħ/7.

Wait, but wait. Let me verify. Because the matrix for sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you compute <alpha | sigma_x | alpha>, you get c_up^* c_down + c_down^* c_up.

Which is (1 - i)/sqrt(7) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) + (2 + i)/sqrt(7) * (1 +i)/sqrt(7).

Compute each term:

First term: (1 -i)(2 - i) = 2 -i -2i + (-1) = 2-3i -1 = 1-3i. Divided by 7.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2(1) + 2i +i(1) +i^2 = 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i. Divided by 7.

Add them: (1-3i +1+3i)/7 = 2/7. So yes, <sigma_x> is 2/7, so <A> = (ħ/2)(2/7)= ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Now, the probabilities. Since the operator A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2, where c_+ and c_- are the expansion coefficients of |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A.

Wait, but another approach: the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of sigma_x, which are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)}.

So I can express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me write |alpha> as a linear combination: |alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>.

Then, the coefficients a and b can be found by solving:

|alpha> = a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Grouping terms:

= [ (a + b)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (a - b)/sqrt(2) ] |down>.

Which should equal to the original |alpha> expression, which is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So equating coefficients:

(a + b)/sqrt(2) = (1 +i)/sqrt(7),

(a - b)/sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

Let me write these as two equations:

Equation 1: (a + b) = (1 + i) * sqrt(2/7),

Equation 2: (a - b) = (2 -i) * sqrt(2/7).

Now, I can solve for a and b. Let's add and subtract the equations.

Adding equations 1 and 2:

2a = (1 +i + 2 -i) * sqrt(2/7) = (3) * sqrt(2/7).

So a = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) = (3) * sqrt(2)/(2 * sqrt(7)) )= 3 * sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)) ).

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

2b = (1 +i - (2 -i)) ) * sqrt(2/7) = (1 +i -2 +i ) = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7).

So b = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7) ] / 2.

Wait, perhaps I can compute a and b.

a = [ (1 + i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7) / 2.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to solve the system:

We have:

a + b = (1 +i) * sqrt(2/7),

a - b = (2 -i) * sqrt(2/7).

Adding the two equations:

2a = [ (1 +i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7) = (3) * sqrt(2/7).

So a = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) = (3) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, subtracting:

(a - b) - (a + b) = [ (2 -i) - (1 +i) ] * sqrt(2/7).

-2b = (1 - 2i) * sqrt(2/7).

So b = [ (i -1/2) ] * sqrt(2/7) * (-1/2) ? Maybe I should compute this again.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write the system as:

a + b = C,

a - b = D,

where C = (1 +i) sqrt(2/7),

D = (2 -i) sqrt(2/7).

Then, adding:

2a = C + D → a = (C + D)/2.

Subtracting:

2b = C - D → b = (C - D)/2.

So C = (1 +i) * sqrt(2/7) = (sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)) (1 +i),

D = (2 -i) sqrt(2/7) = (sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)) (2 -i).

So C + D = [ (1 +i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = (3) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7).

So a = (3 sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)) ) / 2 = 3 sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

Similarly, C - D = [ (1 +i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = [ -1 + 2i ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7).

So b = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) ] / 2.

So now, the coefficients a and b are known. Now, the probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2: (3 sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7))) )^2 = (9 * 2 )/(4 *7) )= 18/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Hmm, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.643. But in the options, I see option A has 0.64 as one of the probabilities.

Wait, let's compute this more precisely.

a = 3 sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

So |a|^2 = (3^2) * (2) )/( (2^2) *7 ) = 9 *2 / (4 *7) )= 18/28 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, compute |b|^2.

b = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) ] / 2.

Compute the modulus squared:

|b|^2 = ( [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] ) * (2)/(7 *4) ) = (1 +4) *2/(28) )= 5 *2 /28 = 10/28 = 5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.3571.

So the probabilities are |a|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428 and |b|^2 =5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A says 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Which matches approximately 9/14 ≈ 0.6428 and 5/14≈0.3571, but option A says 0.36 for the second probability. Hmm, 5/14 is about 0.357, which is close to 0.36.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should compute |b|^2 correctly.

b = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) ) ].

So the modulus squared is | (-1 + 2i) |^2 * (sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)))^2.

|(-1 + 2i)|^2 = (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1+4=5.

sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) is the same as (2^(1/2)) / (2 *7^(1/2)) )= 2^(-1/2) *7^(-1/2) )= 1/(sqrt(14)).

So [sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7))]^2 = (2)/(4 *7) )= (2)/(28) )= 1/14.

So |b|^2 =5 * (1/14) )=5/14.

So |a|^2=9/14, |b|^2=5/14.

So probabilities are approximately 0.6428 and 0.3571.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 → which are close.

The average value was ħ/7, which is one of the options in A.

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Option A is 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7.

So that would match our calculations for the probabilities and the expectation value.

But wait, let's check the other options.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29, and 2ħ/sqrt(7). Hmm, the average is higher, but our calculation is ħ/7.

Option C: 0.28, 0.72, which doesn't seem to fit.

Option B: 0.54, 0.46, which is not matching.

So option A seems to fit.

Wait, but let me recheck the average value. The average value was ħ/7, which is option A's third value.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.357. So the options say 0.64 and 0.36. That's close. So the correct answer would be option A.

But wait, there's another possibility. Maybe the operator is not sigma_x. Because Aij is 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. So it's a 2x2 matrix with off-diagonal elements ħ/2.

Wait, another way: perhaps the operator is proportional to the Pauli Y matrix? No, because the Pauli Y matrix has [[0, -i],[i,0]], so the off-diagonal elements are imaginary. So that can't be it.

Alternatively, the operator could be (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, which is [[0, 1],[1, 0]] scaled by ħ/2.

So the operator is sigma_x multiplied by ħ/2.

So yes, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

Hmm, so the average value is ħ/7, which is option A.

Wait, but let me check another approach. Perhaps the probabilities can be found using the expectation values of the eigenstates.

Wait, the operator has eigenstates |+x> and |-x> with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

The probability of measuring +ħ/2 is |<+x | alpha >|^2 and similarly for |-x>.

So let me compute <+x | alpha>:

|+x> is (|up> +|down>)/sqrt(2).

So <+x | alpha> = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

= (1/sqrt(2)) (1+i) + (1/sqrt(2)) (2 -i) ) / sqrt(7).

Because <up|up> is 1, <down|down> is 1, and cross terms are zero.

So this equals [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2) sqrt(7)).

Simplify numerator: (1+2) + (i -i) )=3.

So <+x | alpha> = 3/(sqrt(14)).

So the probability is |3/(sqrt(14))|^2 =9/14 ≈0.6428.

Similarly, compute <+x|alpha>^2 =9/14, as we had earlier.

And the other probability is |< -x | alpha>|^2.

Compute <-x | alpha>.

| -x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So <-x | alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| - <down| ) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

= (1/sqrt(2)) ( (1+i) - (2 -i) ) / sqrt(7).

So numerator: (1+i) -2 +i = (-1 +2i).

So <-x | alpha> = (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

The modulus squared is |(-1 +2i)|² /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.3571.

So again, the probabilities are ~0.6428 and ~0.3571, which match our earlier calculation.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. That matches.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7, which fits.

But wait, let's check the average value again. The expectation value we found was ħ/7, which is exactly option A.

So the correct option must be option A, which is 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the probabilities of measuring an electron in the eigenstates of an operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) for \( i \neq j \) and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be determined. The state of the electron is given as \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-component of the spin operator.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the inner product:
\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

### Step 2: Identify the operator \( A \)
The matrix representation of \( A \) is:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is equivalent to \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), which are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \), with eigenvalues \( +\frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

### Step 3: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the \( |+x\rangle, |-x\rangle \) basis
To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in this basis:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = a |+x\rangle + b |-x\rangle,
\]
where \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \). Substituting \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we solve for \( a \) and \( b \):
\[
a = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad b = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the probabilities
The probabilities of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are given by \( |a|^2 \) and \( |b|^2 \), respectively:
\[
|a|^2 = \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6429, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571.
\]

### Step 5: Compute the average value of \( A \)
The expectation value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle.
\]
Using \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \, \text{Re}(c_{\uparrow}^* c_{\downarrow}) \), where \( c_{\uparrow} = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( c_{\downarrow} = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \), we find:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{2}{7}, \quad \langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 6: Match with the options
The probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). These match the values in **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
