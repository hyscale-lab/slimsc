Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The options are given, but I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, let me read the problem again. So the operator P has components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each of these is given as ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So I think the operator vector P is like a vector operator, and we're looking for its eigenvector along a direction n in the x-z plane. 

The direction vector n is in the x-z plane, so I guess it's making some angle θ with the z-axis. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in spherical coordinates, the x is sinθ cosφ, but wait, since it's in the x-z plane, φ must be 0 or π, but since the direction is arbitrary in the plane, perhaps the angle is θ measured from z to x.

Wait, the operator P is a vector operator, so P = P_x x_hat + P_y y_hat + P_z z_hat. So when we take the operator P · n, where n is the direction vector, that should give the component of P in that direction. So the eigenvalue equation is (P · n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

But wait, the problem says the eigenvector corresponds to eigenvalue +ħ/2, so the operator P · n has eigenvalue ħ/2 for this vector.

So first, I need to construct the matrix representation of P · n. Since n is in the x-z plane, n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), I think. So the operator P · n would be (sinθ) P_x + (cosθ) P_z. 

Given that, I can write the matrix for P · n by taking the respective components. Let me write down the given matrices:

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1],[1,0]].
P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]].
P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0],[0, -1]].

So P · n is (sinθ) P_x + (cosθ) P_z.

Let me compute that matrix:

Each component is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrices. So,

P · n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me add the matrices inside:

The (1,1) element is cosθ * 1. The (1,2) element is sinθ * 1. The (2,1) is sinθ *1, and (2,2) is -cosθ.

So the matrix becomes:

[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Multiply by ħ/2:

(ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Wait, no, wait. Because each term is (ħ/2) multiplied by the corresponding matrix. So the overall operator is (ħ/2) times [ sinθ * P_x_matrix + cosθ * P_z_matrix ].

Wait, no, more accurately, it's (ħ/2) multiplied by ( sinθ * P_x_matrix + cosθ * P_z_matrix ), because each P component is ħ/2 times their respective matrices.

So, (sinθ) P_x matrix is [ [0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

Similarly, (cosθ) P_z matrix is [ [cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

So when you add these two, the combined matrix is:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
          [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, no: Wait, P_x's matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so multiplying by sinθ gives [[0, sinθ],[sinθ,0]]. And P_z's matrix is [[1,0],[0,-1]], multiplied by cosθ gives [[cosθ,0],[0,-cosθ]]. Adding these together gives [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]. Then, multiply by (ħ/2):

P · n = (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]].

So the operator's matrix is (ħ/2) times that. Now, the eigenvalue equation is [ P · n ] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

So the matrix equation is:

(ħ/2) [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

We can divide both sides by (ħ/2), so the equation becomes:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] [a; b] = [a; b]

So the matrix equation is:

[ cosθ a + sinθ b = a
  sinθ a - cosθ b = b ]

Which simplifies to:

( cosθ -1 ) a + sinθ b = 0  ...(1)
 sinθ a + ( -cosθ -1 ) b = 0 ...(2)

So equation (1): [ (cosθ -1) ] a + (sinθ) b = 0
Equation (2): (sinθ) a + [ (-cosθ -1) ] b = 0

Let me write these as:

(1) (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
(2) sinθ a + ( -cosθ -1 ) b = 0

Hmm, so from equation (1), we can express a in terms of b. So,

(cosθ -1 ) a = - sinθ b
a = [ - sinθ b ] / ( cosθ -1 )

Similarly, equation (2) would give another expression for a in terms of b. Let me check for consistency.

Let me compute equation (2):

sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b = 0
=> a = [ (cosθ +1) b ] / sinθ

Wait, but equation (1):

a = [ - sinθ b ] / ( cosθ -1 ) = [ sinθ b ] / (1 - cosθ )

Because cosθ - 1 = -(1 - cosθ). So,

From equation (1): a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b
From equation (2): a = [ (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ ] b

So setting these equal:

sinθ / (1 - cosθ ) = (cosθ + 1 ) / sinθ

Cross-multiplying: sin^2θ = (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ)

But wait, (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ) = 1 - cos^2θ = sin^2θ. So yes, the equality holds.

So, both equations are the same condition, which gives us a relation between a and b.

So, the eigenvalue equation is satisfied when a and b are related by a = [ (1 + cosθ ) / sinθ ] b.

Wait, let me double-check that:

From equation (2), a = [ (cosθ + 1) / sinθ ] b.

So, eigenstates are vectors [a, b]^T where a = [ (1 + cosθ)/ sinθ ] b.

Let me express b in terms of a:

b = [ sinθ / (1 + cosθ) ] a.

But perhaps it's easier to express in terms of a ratio. Let me write a = k, and then b = [ sinθ / (1 + cosθ) ] k.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to pick a value. Let's assume a is some scalar multiple, and express b in terms of a.

Wait, let me think about possible eigenvectors. The eigenvector can be expressed as a two-component vector [a, b], where a = K * [ (1 + cosθ) / sinθ ] * b, with K being a normalization factor. Wait, maybe I should express it in terms of a single parameter.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parameterize the eigenvector. Let me set b = 1, then a = (1 + cosθ)/ sinθ.

So the vector would be [ (1 + cosθ)/ sinθ , 1 ].

But to make it a unit vector, we need to normalize. So the norm squared is [ (1 + cosθ)^2 / sin^2θ ] + 1.

Let me compute that:

(1 + cosθ)^2 / sin^2θ + 1 = [ (1 + 2 cosθ + cos^2θ ) + sin^2θ ] / sin^2θ

But sin^2θ = 1 - cos^2θ, so numerator becomes:

1 + 2 cosθ + cos^2θ + 1 - cos^2θ = 2 + 2 cosθ.

So the denominator is sin^2θ = (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ).

So the norm squared is [ 2(1 + cosθ) ] / [ (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ) ) ] = 2 / (1 - cosθ).

So the norm is sqrt( 2/(1 - cosθ) ) ) = sqrt( [4 cos^2(θ/2) ] / (2 sin^2(θ/2)) ) ) ?

Wait, perhaps using trigonometric identities would help. Let me recall that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin^2(θ/2), and 1 + cosθ = 2 cos^2(θ/2). So substituting:

Numerator: 2( 2 cos^2(θ/2) ) = 4 cos^2(θ/2)
Denominator: (2 sin^2(θ/2) ) * (2 cos^2(θ/2) )) ?

Wait no, let me correct. The expression for the norm squared is [ (1 + cosθ)^2 + sin^2θ ] / sin^2θ.

Wait, earlier calculation: [ (1 + cosθ)^2 + sin^2θ ] / sin^2θ.

Wait, no, no, the norm squared is [ ( (1 + cosθ)^2 + sin^2θ ) ] / sin^2θ.

Wait, wait, the norm squared is [ ( (1 + cosθ)/ sinθ )^2 + 1 ].

Wait, because a is (1 + cosθ)/ sinθ, so a^2 is (1 + cosθ)^2 / sin^2θ, and b is 1, so b^2 is 1. So the sum is (1 + 2 cosθ + cos^2θ ) / sin^2θ + 1.

Which is [ (1 + 2 cosθ + cos^2θ ) + sin^2θ ] / sin^2θ.

But 1 = sin^2θ + cos^2θ. So the numerator becomes:

1 + 2 cosθ + cos^2θ + sin^2θ = (1 + sin^2θ + cos^2θ) ) + 2 cosθ.

Wait, 1 + sin^2θ + cos^2θ = 1 + 1 = 2, so numerator is 2 + 2 cosθ.

So the norm squared is (2 + 2 cosθ) / sin^2θ.

Factor numerator: 2(1 + cosθ).

Denominator: sin^2θ = (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ).

So norm squared is [ 2 (1 + cosθ) ] / [ (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ) ) ].

Simplify: The (1 + cosθ) terms cancel, leaving 2 / (1 - cosθ).

Which again, using 1 - cosθ = 2 sin^2(θ/2), becomes 2 / (2 sin^2(θ/2)) ) = 1 / sin^2(θ/2).

So the norm is 1 / sin(θ/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ a, b ] where a = (1 + cosθ)/(sinθ) and b = 1, but normalized by 1/( sin(θ/2) ), because sqrt( norm squared ) is 1/sin(θ/2).

Wait, no, the norm is 1 / sin(θ/2), so the eigenvector is:

[ (1 + cosθ)/(sinθ) * sin(θ/2), 1 * sin(θ/2) ]

Because to make the norm 1, you multiply each component by sin(θ/2).

Wait, let me compute (1 + cosθ) in terms of theta/2. 1 + cosθ = 2 cos^2(θ/2). And sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So (1 + cosθ)/sinθ = [ 2 cos^2(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] = [ cos(theta/2) ] / sin(theta/2 ) = cot(theta/2).

So the a component is (1 + cosθ)/(sinθ) = cot(theta/2).

But when we normalize by multiplying by sin(theta/2), the a component becomes cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2).

Similarly, the b component is 1 * sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but wait, the eigenvector we found earlier was [a, b] = [ (1 + cos theta)/ sin theta * b, b ].

But when we normalized, with b=1, the norm was 1/sin(theta/2), so each component is multiplied by sin(theta/2) to get [ (1 + cos theta)/( sin theta ) * sin(theta/2), 1 * sin(theta/2) ].

Which simplifies to [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, does that make sense? Let me think: The eigenvalue is +ħ/2, which is the same as the eigenvalue for the spin-up state along the z-axis. So when the direction n is along z (theta=0), the eigenvector should be [1, 0], because that's the spin-up state. Let's see: If theta is 0, cos(theta/2) is cos(0)=1, sin(theta/2)=0. So yes, that's correct.

Similarly, if theta is 180 degrees (along negative z), then cos(theta/2) is cos(90) = 0, sin(theta/2)=1. So the eigenvector would be [0, 1], which is the spin-down state, but wait, no, because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so along negative z, the spin-up direction would correspond to the eigenvector [0,1], because the spin operator along negative z would have eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. So in that case, if theta is pi, the direction is along -z, and the eigenvector would be [0,1], which matches our result.

So the normalized eigenvector components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So the vector is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ).

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option D is sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2) and sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2). But wait, in our calculation, the components are just cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), so they don't have any hbar factors. Moreover, the problem says to find the normalized eigenvector, which shouldn't have any hbar because eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple, and in quantum mechanics, the components are in units of 1, not hbar.

Wait, the question says to find the elements of the normalized eigenvector, so the options should have elements without hbar. So looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option B is (cos theta, e^{i phi} sin theta). Hmm, but phi is zero here because the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi is 0 or pi, but the problem says the direction is arbitrary in x-z, so perhaps phi can be considered zero. But then, B would be (cos theta, sin theta), but that doesn't match what we found. Also, our solution doesn't involve phi.

So the correct normalized eigenvector is option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$  

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be expressed as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle $\vec{n}$ makes with the z-axis. The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is constructed as:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \sin\theta P_x + \cos\theta P_z
\]

Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, we find:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \right) \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]

Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, we obtain:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]

This simplifies to the system of equations:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0 \tag{1}
\]
\[
\sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0 \tag{2}
\]

From Equation (1), we solve for $a$ in terms of $b$:

\[
a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b
\]

Using the trigonometric identities $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, this becomes:

\[
a = \frac{\cos(\theta/2)}{\sin(\theta/2)} b = \cot(\theta/2) b
\]

Thus, the eigenvector can be written as:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = b \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we compute the norm:

\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{\cot^2(\theta/2) + 1} = \sqrt{\csc^2(\theta/2)} = \frac{1}{\sin(\theta/2)}
\]

Multiplying each component by $\sin(\theta/2)$, the normalized eigenvector becomes:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}
\]

Now, we compare this result with the given options:

- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ — Incorrect, as the components do not match the derived result and include unnecessary factors of $\hbar$.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ — Incorrect, as this form does not match the normalized eigenvector derived above.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ — Correct, as this matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ — Incorrect, as the components include unnecessary factors of $\hbar$ and do not match the derived result.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
