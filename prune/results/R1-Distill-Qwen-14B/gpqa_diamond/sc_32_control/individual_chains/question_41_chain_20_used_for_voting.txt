Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light relative to the observer.

Wait, so in a stationary glass, the speed of light would be c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n is c divided by the speed in the medium. So normally, v_light = c/n. But here, the glass is moving.

But wait, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. Hmm, so from the lab frame, the glass is moving, and the light is also moving in that direction.

I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Oh right, the velocity addition formula from special relativity. But wait, I should check whether that applies here.

Wait, but wait. The speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, right? But wait, no, that's only in a vacuum. In a medium, the speed is different. So maybe this is a bit trickier.

Hold on, the problem states that the light is in the glass, which has an index of refraction n. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v_light = c/n. But in the lab frame, where the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, how does this change?

Wait, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, which is toward the observer. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So from the lab frame, what's the speed of light?

I think I need to apply a velocity transformation here. Let me recall the velocity addition formula. The formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²), where u is the velocity of the object in the first frame (the glass's frame), and u' is the velocity in the lab frame.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me get the frames right. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at u = c/n. Now, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So in the lab frame, what's the speed of the light?

Using the velocity addition formula, u' = (u + v')/(1 + (u v')/c²), but wait, I might get the signs mixed up. Oh right, in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer at speed v. So from the glass's frame, the lab is moving at -v. So the light's velocity in the lab frame would be u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²).

Wait, no, wait. The velocity addition formula is when you have a frame S' moving at velocity v relative to S. In S', the velocity is u, so in S, it's u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²).

Wait, but in this case, in the glass's frame, the light's speed is u = c/n. The glass's frame is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So when we go from the glass frame to the lab frame, which is moving at +v relative to the glass, we need to add v to u, adjusted by the Lorentz factor.

So applying the formula, u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c^2)).

Substituting u = c/n, we get:

u' = (c/n + v) / [1 + (c v)/(n c²)].

Simplify the denominator:

1 + (v)/(n c).

So u' = (c/n + v) / (1 + v/(n c)) ).

Hmm. Let me factor out 1/(n c) from the numerator and denominator.

Wait, let me express the denominator as (n c + v)/(n c).

So, u' = [ (c + n v) / n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ]

Which is equal to [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

Simplify:

The n cancels out, and we get [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

Wait, let me compute that:

The numerator is (c + n v) * c = c² + n v c.

The denominator is (n c + v).

So u' = (c² + n v c) / (n c + v).

Factor c from numerator and denominator:

c (c + n v) / [ c (n) + v ) ].

Wait, wait, no, denominator is n c + v. Let me factor c out from denominator:

n c + v = c (n + v/c).

So u' = [c (c +n v)] / [ c (n + v/c) ) ]

The c's cancel: (c +n v)/(n + v/c).

Wait, but v/c is a term here. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor differently.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of units. Since c is 1 here (as per the question, c=1), so let's substitute c=1.

So c=1, so u = 1/n.

Velocity addition formula becomes u' = (u + v) / (1 + u v).

Because with c=1, the denominator becomes 1 + (u v)/(1^2) ) = 1 + u v.

So substituting u=1/n, we get:

u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (v)(1/n) )

Which is ( (1 + n v)/n ) / ( (n + v)/n )

Because 1 + (v/n) is (n +v)/n.

So the numerator is (1 + n v)/n, denominator is (n + v)/n.

So when you divide them, the n's cancel, giving (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Wait, that looks like option A.

Wait, the options are:

A) (1 + n v)/(n + v)

B) 1

C) (1 +n v)/(n - v)

D) (1 -n v)/(n +v )

So according to my calculation, the answer is option A.

But wait, I should double-check. Let's think about the scenario. If the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is in the same direction, would the observed speed be higher or lower than c/n? Hmm.

Wait, in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards us, so from the lab perspective, the light is moving at (c/n + v)/(1 + (c/n) v/c^2 ). Wait, no, let me re-express that.

Wait, when I apply the velocity addition formula, if the medium (glass) is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the medium (towards the observer), then the light's speed relative to the lab would actually be higher than c/n.

Wait, but according to option A, when v is positive (since glass is moving towards the observer), the numerator is (1 +n v) and the denominator is (n +v). So for v positive, both numerator and denominator are positive.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about the units. Suppose that n is 1 (vacuum) and v is zero. Then the speed should be 1, which it is. If the glass isn't moving, then the speed is 1/n, which with n=1 is 1, correct.

Another test case: n=1, v = 0.5 (say, in units where c=1). Then the speed would be (1 + 1*0.5)/(1 +0.5) ) = (1.5)/(1.5) = 1. So that's correct. Because in that case, the medium is moving at 0.5, light speed in medium is 1 (same as vacuum, which is not possible, but perhaps n=1 is a special case).

Wait, but if n=2, v=0. Let's see. Then, u' would be (1 + 0)/(2 +0 ) = 1/2, which is correct, as in the medium, speed is 1/2.

Another test: n=1, v=0.5. Then u' is (1 + 1*0.5)/(1 +0.5) )= (1.5)/(1.5)=1, which again is correct because in vacuum, light speed is always 1.

Wait, so that seems to work.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the case when the medium is moving at a significant fraction of c. For example, n=1, and v=0.8. Then,

u' = (1 +1*0.8)/(1 +0.8) )= (1.8)/(1.8) = 1, which is correct because in vacuum, regardless of the medium's speed, light should be c=1.

Wait, but in this case, the medium isn't a vacuum, but n=1 implies it's a vacuum. So that makes sense.

Another test: n=3, v=0.5.

u' = (1 +3 *0.5)/(3 +0.5) )= (1 +1.5)/(3.5) )= 2.5 /3.5 ≈ 0.714. Hmm, that's less than c=1, which makes sense because the medium is moving towards the observer, but light's speed is relative.

Wait, but if the medium is moving towards us, the light's speed in our frame should be higher than the rest frame speed. Wait, because the medium is bringing the light towards us. So, if the medium is moving towards us, and the light is moving in the same direction, shouldn't the observed speed be higher than c/n?

Wait, wait, let me think again. If the glass is moving towards me, and the light is moving in the same direction (towards me), then the light's speed relative to me would be higher than c/n, right?

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, when the medium moves towards me (v positive), the speed is (1 +n v)/(n +v). Let's plug in n=2, v=0.5.

(1 +2*0.5)/(2 + 0.5) )= (1+1)/(2.5) )= 2/2.5=0.8.

But c/n is 0.5, and 0.8 is greater. So that makes sense. So when the medium moves towards the observer, the observed speed is higher than c/n. Which is correct.

Another case: What if the medium is moving away from the observer? Then v is negative. So for n=2, v=-0.5,

(1 +2*(-0.5))/(2 + (-0.5)) )= (1-1)/(1.5) )= 0/1.5=0, which makes sense? No, because if the medium is moving away and the light is moving in the same direction as the medium, the light's speed should be less than c/n.

Wait, but in this case, the light is in the medium, which is moving away. So the light's speed, according to the formula, would be [1 + n v]/[n + v]. Let me plug in n=2, v= -0.5.

(1 -1)/(2-0.5) )= 0 / 1.5=0. Hmm, but that can't be right. Because if the medium is moving away, the light's speed would be (c/n - |v| )/(1 - (c/n) |v|/c² )? Or wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction.

Wait, the velocity addition formula depends on how the frames are moving. Let me think again. The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. The light's velocity in the glass frame is u = c/n, towards the observer (so same direction as v).

So when the glass is moving towards the observer (+v), the light's speed in the lab would be higher.

When the glass is moving away from the observer (-v), the light's speed in lab would be lower.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, when v is negative, and n is 2:

u' = (1 + n v )/(n +v )

So if v is negative, say v=-0.5, then numerator is 1 + (2*(-0.5))= 1-1=0. So speed is zero, which is impossible, as light can't have zero speed. That suggests an error in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the velocity addition formula. Let me re-examine.

The correct velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² )

But when the frame S' (glass) is moving at speed v relative to S (lab), then in S, the velocity u' is given by (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c² )

Wait, but in this case, in the glass frame, the light is moving at u = c/n. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab.

Wait, so velocity in lab frame is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² )

But since c=1, this becomes (u + v)/(1 + u v )

So substituting u=1/n,

u' = (1/n + v) / ( 1 + (1/n) v )

Which is (1 + n v)/(n + v ), as I thought earlier.

Wait, but when v is negative (glass moving away), let's take n=2, v= -0.5.

u' = (1 + 2*(-0.5) )/(2 + (-0.5) ) = (1-1)/(1.5 )= 0/1.5=0 → which can't be right.

Wait, that's impossible. Because if the glass is moving away at 0.5c, and the light is moving at 0.5c in the same direction (towards the observer, but the glass is moving away, so the light is moving towards the observer, but the glass is moving away. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the directions.

Wait, the problem states that the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. So if the glass is moving away, then the beam is moving opposite to the glass's direction, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, no, the problem says that the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So if the glass is moving towards the observer, the beam is going in the same direction as the glass. If the glass were moving away, the beam would be going in the opposite direction. But the problem says the glass is moving "toward the observer", so v is positive in that case.

Wait, but the question says, what happens when the glass is moving at velocity v in same direction as beam and toward the observer. So v is positive.

So perhaps negative v isn't a case we need to consider here. But the formula should still hold for when the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass.

So in that scenario, the formula gives the correct u' as (1 +n v)/(n +v), which is option A.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A.

To determine the speed of light in the moving glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we apply the relativistic velocity addition formula. In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is \( u = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( n \) is the index of refraction. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) relative to the lab frame in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( u = \frac{c}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \) (as given in the problem), the formula becomes:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}} = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab frame is:

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option **A**. To confirm, consider test cases:

1. **If \( v = 0 \):** The speed reduces to \( \frac{1}{n} \), which is correct for a stationary medium.
2. **If \( n = 1 \):** The speed becomes \( \frac{1 + v}{1 + v} = 1 \), consistent with the speed of light in a vacuum.
3. **If \( n = 2, v = 0.5 \):** The speed is \( \frac{1 + 2(0.5)}{2 + 0.5} = \frac{2}{2.5} = 0.8 \), which is greater than \( \frac{1}{2} \), as expected when the medium moves toward the observer.

The derived formula is consistent with relativistic principles and the problem's conditions.
