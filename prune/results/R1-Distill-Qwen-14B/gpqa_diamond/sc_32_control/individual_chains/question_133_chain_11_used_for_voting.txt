Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with buffer solutions and all the phosphate ion calculations. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution with 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-. The temperatures are 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are given: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

First, I remember that orthophosphate is the conjugate base here. I think that in a solution with both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, we're dealing with a buffer solution. So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation might come into play here. Wait, but wait—KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- and Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2-? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(H2PO4), so when it dissociates, it gives H2PO4^- and K+ ions. Na2HPO4 is sodium dihydrogen phosphate, I think. Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. HPO4^2- is the hydrogen phosphate ion.

Wait, let me get this straight. H3PO4 is phosphoric acid. It can lose three protons:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^-
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2-
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-

So, the first dissociation (Ka1) is about H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^-.
The second (Ka2) is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-.
The third (Ka3) is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-.

In the solution, we have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.
Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since Na is +1 each, so two of them balance the -2 charge on HPO4^2-).

Wait, but wait—what's the formula for Na2HPO4? It's sodium hydrogen phosphate. So, it's Na2(HPO4). So when dissolved, gives 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So, in solution, we have H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4). So, that's a buffer solution between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Which means we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation. Because the relevant equilibrium here is the second one: H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait—the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. Hmm, okay, so PO4^3- comes from the third dissociation step: HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

But in the solution, we have HPO4^2- as the major species from the Na2HPO4. So, wait, would PO4^3- be present? Or is it negligible? Because the HPO4^2- can lose another proton to become PO4^3-.

But the HPO4^2- is a weak base (since it's the conjugate base of H2PO4^-). So, in solution, it can act as a base and accept a proton to form H2PO4^- or as an acid and lose a proton to form PO4^3-.

Wait, but the solution here has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So, it's a buffer solution between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which is the second dissociation step. So, the pH of the solution is determined by that buffer.

But the question is about PO4^3- concentration. That's the third ion. So, perhaps we can calculate the [PO4^3-] by considering the third dissociation.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Calculate the moles of each salt in the solution.
2. Find the molarity of each.
3. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH based on the buffer (H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-).
4. Use the third dissociation equation (HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-) to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps since the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH is determined by that, and then the third dissociation is a small step. But I'm not sure. Let me proceed.

First, calculate the moles of each component.

KH2PO4: molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. We have 1.00 g.

Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007336 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So, 1.00 g / 177.99 ≈ 0.005612 mol.

Wait, wait—wait, Na2HPO4·2H2O. So the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O, which is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. The molar mass is correct as 177.99 g/mol.

So, moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4: 0.007336 mol.

Moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4: 0.005612 mol.

Now, the solution volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters.

Concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007336 / 0.2 = 0.03668 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005612 / 0.2 = 0.02806 M.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) → let's compute that. The Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8).

Log(6.2) is about 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) is 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076.

Wait, wait: pKa = -log(Ka). So, Ka2 is 6.2e-8. So, log(6.2e-8) is log(6.2) + log(1e-8) = 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So, pKa2 is 7.2076.

Now, the ratio is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02806 / 0.03668 ≈ 0.7654.

So, log(0.7654) is approximately log(0.7654) ≈ -0.115.

So, pH = 7.2076 + (-0.115) ≈ 7.0926.

So, the pH is about 7.09.

Now, to find [PO4^3-], we need to consider the third dissociation:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So, the expression is Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange this to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

We know [HPO4^2-] is 0.02806 M, and [H+] is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.0926).

Let me compute [H+]: 10^(-7.0926). Let's see, 10^(-7) is 1e-7, and 10^(-0.0926) is about 0.867 (since log(0.867)= -0.068; wait, maybe better to compute it accurately. Alternatively, using a calculator approach: 10^0.0926 ≈ 1.237, so 10^(-0.0926) ≈ 0.81.

Wait, wait, wait: 10^0.0926. Let's think: 10^0.09 is about 1.228, because log(1.228) is approximately 0.089. Hmm, perhaps a better way is needed. Alternatively, using exact calculation: 10^(-7.0926) = 10^(-7 - 0.0926) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0926).

Let me compute 10^(-0.0926). Let's see, ln(10^0.0926) = 0.0926 * ln(10) ≈ 0.0926 * 2.3026 ≈ 0.213. So e^(0.213) ≈ 1.237. So 10^0.0926 ≈ 1.237, so 10^(-0.0926) ≈ 1/1.237 ≈ 0.808.

So, [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.808 ≈ 8.08e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12) * (0.02806) / (8.08e-8).

Let me compute that step by step.

First, numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 ≈ 5.0508e-14.

Denominator: 8.08e-8.

So, 5.0508e-14 / 8.08e-8 = (5.0508 / 8.08) ) * 1e-6.

5.0508 / 8.08 ≈ 0.625.

So, 0.625e-6 = 6.25e-7 M.

Wait, but wait the options don't have 6.24e-7. Let me check if I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, let me recompute the denominator.

[H+] is 10^(-7.0926) = approximately 8.08e-8 M.

Yes.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12) * (0.02806) / (8.08e-8).

Compute 1.8e-12 * 0.02806:

0.02806 is 2.806e-2.

So, 1.8e-12 * 2.806e-2 = (1.8 * 2.806) * 1e-14.

1.8 * 2.806 ≈ 5.0508.

So, 5.0508e-14.

Divide by 8.08e-8:

5.0508e-14 / 8.08e-8 = (5.0508 / 8.08) * 1e-6.

5.0508 / 8.08 ≈ 0.625.

0.625e-6 = 6.25e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is very close to 6.25e-7. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a rounding error somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check the pH calculation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 is 7.2076.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02806 M, [H2PO4^-] is 0.03668 M.

Ratio is 0.02806 / 0.03668 ≈ 0.7654.

Log(0.7654) is approximately what? Let me calculate log(0.7654).

I know that log(0.7) is about -0.1549.

Log(0.75)= -0.1249.

Wait, wait, 10^(-0.125)= about 0.75 (since 10^0.125 is around 1.333, so 1/1.333 is 0.75).

Wait, but 0.7654 is between 0.75 and 0.8.

Let me compute log(0.7654):

Using the approximation, maybe I can use a calculator-like approach.

Alternatively, I'll use natural logarithm and then convert to base 10.

ln(0.7654) is approximately ln(0.7654) ≈ -0.267.

Since ln(x) = 2.3026 * log(x), so log(0.7654) = ln(0.7654)/2.3026 ≈ (-0.267)/2.3026 ≈ -0.116.

So, log(0.7654) ≈ -0.116.

So, pH = 7.2076 + (-0.116) = 7.0916, which is about 7.092.

So, [H+] = 10^(-7.092) ≈ 8.08e-8.

Then, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / (8.08e-8).

Another approach: Let's compute each value more accurately.

[H+] = 1e-7 * 10^(-0.092) ≈ 1e-7 * 0.867 = 8.67e-8 M.

Wait, because pH is 7.092, which is 7 + 0.092. So, [H+] = 1e-7 * 10^(-0.092) ≈ 8.67e-8. Wait, earlier I thought it was 8.08e-8, but perhaps I should do a more accurate calculation.

Let me compute 10^(-0.092) accurately.

Using a calculator approach:

The exact value of 10^(-0.092):

We can use the Taylor series expansion for 10^x around x=0:

10^x ≈ 1 + x*ln(10) + (x^2)*(ln(10)^2)/2 + ... 

But perhaps it's easier to use a known value. Alternatively, I can remember that 10^0.092 is approximately 1.237.

Wait, 10^0.1 ≈ 1.2589. So, 0.092 is a bit less than 0.1, so 10^0.092 ≈ 1.235.

Therefore, 10^(-0.092) ≈ 1/1.235 ≈ 0.810.

So, [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.810 ≈ 8.10e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / (8.10e-8).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 = 5.0508e-14.

Divide by 8.10e-8: 5.0508e-14 /8.10e-8 = (5.0508 /8.10) ) * 1e-6.

5.0508 /8.10 ≈ 0.62355.

So, 0.62355e-6 = 6.2355e-7 M.

Which is about 6.24e-7, which matches option A.

Wait, but wait. The options are:

A) 6.24x10^-7 M

B)5.48x10^-7 M 

C)2.81x10^-7 M

D)3.97x10^-7 M 

So, according to this, option A is the right answer.

But wait, I feel like I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the solution considers the contribution of HPO4^2- dissociating into PO4^3- and H+. But in the presence of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the solution is a buffer, so PO4^3- would be the product of the third dissociation.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate it without using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation because maybe the solution is more complex. Let me think about the exact approach.

The solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in certain concentrations. The total phosphate is the sum of H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-, but since the solution is dilute and the pH is around 7, the H3PO4 is negligible, and the PO4^3- is very small.

The main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So, the buffer equation is correct.

Wait, but when you have a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH is determined by the ratio of their concentrations. Then, the concentration of PO4^3- comes from the third dissociation, which is a small amount.

So, maybe using the approach I took is correct, and the answer is option A.

But wait, another thing to consider: the solution might be using the third dissociation and the buffer from HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- to find the pH, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is to calculate the concentrations of each phosphate species considering all equilibria.

But that could be complicated. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the third dissociation. Wait, no, because the solution isn't a buffer for that step. It's a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps I should write the expression for all the species.

Let me denote:

[H3PO4] is negligible because pH is 7, which is much higher than pKa1 (around 2.12, wait no, pKa1 is 7.2076? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, wait no: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, so pKa1 is around 2.12.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, because pKa1 is -log(7.5e-3)≈ 2.12.

But the pH is 7.09, which is higher than pKa1, so H3PO4 is negligible.

Then, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But in the solution, we have both H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4).

So, the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Thus, the first step is correct in using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.

Then, the third dissociation (HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-) contributes to PO4^3- concentration.

Wait, but I'm not considering the effect of H+ from the third dissociation on the overall pH, but since PO4^3- is very small, its effect on pH would be minimal. So, the approximation that [H+] is determined by the buffer is acceptable.

So, I think my initial approach was correct, leading to option A.

But let me check the calculation again.

[HPO4^2-] =0.02806 M.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

pKa3 is about 11.74 (since pKa3 = -log(1.8e-12)≈ 11.74).

So, the third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The expression is Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

Solving for PO4^3- gives:

PO4^3- = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

We have [HPO4^2-] = 0.02806 M.

[H+] = 8.08e-8 M.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

So,

PO4^3- = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / 8.08e-8.

Calculating numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 = 5.0508e-14.

Divide by 8.08e-8: 5.0508e-14 /8.08e-8 = (5.0508 /8.08) ) * 1e-6.

5.0508 /8.08 ≈ 0.625.

So, 0.625e-6 = 6.25e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.24e-7 M, matching option A.

Wait, but wait another thing: the total concentration of all phosphate species should be the sum of H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

But in this case, with the given amount of salts, the sum should be 0.007336 (H2PO4^-) + 0.005612 (HPO4^2- ) + x (PO4^3- ), where x is very small compared to the others.

But in my calculation, x is about 6.24e-7 M, which is much smaller than 0.03668 and 0.02806 (which are about 0.03 M and 0.028 M respectively), so the approximation holds.

So, I think option A is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄) and HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O), which act as a buffer for the second dissociation of H₃PO₄:

\[
\text{H₂PO₄⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{H⁺} + \text{HPO₄²⁻}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles and concentrations
- **KH₂PO₄**:  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007336 \, \text{mol} \)  
  Concentration = \( \frac{0.007336}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.03668 \, \text{M} \).

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005612 \, \text{mol} \)  
  Concentration = \( \frac{0.005612}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.02806 \, \text{M} \).

### Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation
The pH of the buffer is determined by the second dissociation constant (\( K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \)):

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right)
\]

- \( \text{p}K_a2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.2076 \).  
- Ratio = \( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} = \frac{0.02806}{0.03668} \approx 0.7654 \).  
- \( \log(0.7654) \approx -0.115 \).  

Thus,  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.2076 - 0.115 \approx 7.0926.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate [PO₄³⁻] using the third dissociation
The third dissociation of HPO₄²⁻ is:

\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}
\]

The equilibrium constant is \( K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \), and the expression is:

\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]

Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]

- \([\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.0926} \approx 8.08 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\).  
- \([\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = 0.02806 \, \text{M}\).  

Substitute values:

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02806)}{8.08 \times 10^{-8}}
\]

- Numerator: \( (1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02806) \approx 5.0508 \times 10^{-14} \).  
- Denominator: \( 8.08 \times 10^{-8} \).  

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.0508 \times 10^{-14}}{8.08 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Final Answer
The concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately \( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches option **A**.

**Answer: A**
