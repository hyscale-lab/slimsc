Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember something about the Boltzmann equation and excitation levels from my studies. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. Oh right, that means the population of the excited state in star_1 is higher. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, and the photospheres are in LTE, so I can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

The Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy states to temperature. The formula is n_j / n_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp( - (E_j - E_i)/(k*T) ), where n_j and n_i are the number of particles in states j and i, g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, since the energy levels are specific, I think we can assume that the statistical weights (g) for both states are the same. Otherwise, the problem wouldn't give us enough info. So g_j over g_i would be 1, simplifying the equation.

The ratio given is n1/n2 = 2/1. Let me write that: n1/n2 = 2. So according to the equation, 2 = exp( -(ΔE)/(k*T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference, 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, but wait. Are the excited states higher or lower? Oh, right, higher energy states have higher E. So if star_1 has higher excitation (more in the higher state), then that's more likely when the temperature is higher because higher temperature makes particles more energetic, so they can reach higher energy states more often.

So taking the natural log of both sides:

ln(2) = - (ΔE)/(k*T) * (T_i - T_j?), no, wait. Let me think again. The equation is 2 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), so taking ln on both sides gives ln(2) = -(ΔE)/(k*T). Wait but that would lead to a negative value on the right. Wait, no. Because ΔE is the energy difference. Let me clarify.

Wait, wait, the equation is n_j / n_i = exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k T) ), and since j is the excited state, E_j > E_i. So E_j - E_i is positive. So the equation becomes 2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is positive.

Taking natural log: ln(2) = -ΔE/(k T) → ΔE/(k T) = -ln(2). But that would make ΔE/(k T) negative, which can't be since ΔE is positive and T is positive. Wait, I must have messed up something.

Wait, no, let's go back. The ratio is n_j/n_i = 2. So 2 = exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k*T) ). Wait, but E_j is higher than E_i, so E_j - E_i is positive. So the exponent is negative. So the right-hand side is exp(-x), which is less than 1, but 2 is greater than 1. So that can't be right. Oh wait, maybe I got the ratio backwards. Because if j is the higher state, then the population ratio n_j/n_i would be less than 1 if you're going to lower energy state. But the question says that in star_1, the excited level is twice as much as in star_2. So n_j (excited) in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for each star, we have a ratio.

Wait, perhaps I should model each star's situation separately. Let me think: for star 1, the ratio n1_j/n1_i = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star 2, n2_j/n2_i = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

But the problem is about the excitation between the two stars. Wait, the question states that the excited level in star_1 is twice as excited as in star_2. Wait, but what's the exact comparison? Are they comparing the same energy levels in each star? Oh, the problem says that the energy difference between the levels is the same. So, for each star, the same energy difference exists between the levels.

So the ratio n1_j/n1_i = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and n2_j/n2_i = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). But the problem says that n1_j is twice n2_j, but wait, no, the question says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So n1_j / n2_j = 2. Or is it the ratio between the excited states in the two stars?

Wait, perhaps I should model the ratio of the excited states in each star. Let's say in star 1, the excited state population is n1, and in star 2, it's n2. The question states n1 = 2 n2. But we also have each star's own ratio based on their temperatures.

Wait, perhaps each star's populations are determined by their own temperatures. So for star 1, n1_j/n1_i = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star 2, n2_j/n2_i = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). But the question says that in star_1, the excited level is twice as excited as in star_2. So perhaps n1_j = 2 n2_j. Or maybe n1_j / n1_i = 2 (n2_j / n2_i). Or perhaps n1_j / n1_i = 2 (n2_i / n2_j)? I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the problem says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So I think this means that the population of the excited state in star_1 is twice that of the same state in star_2. So n1_j = 2 n2_j.

But we can also relate each star's excited state to their ground state. Let me denote for each star:

For star_1: n1_j / n1_i = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) → equation 1
For star_2: n2_j / n2_i = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) → equation 2

But we also have n1_j = 2 n2_j. Hmm, but that's one equation and two variables (n1_i and n2_i). Maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express the ratio of the two ratios. Let's compute (n1_j / n1_i) divided by (n2_j / n2_i). That would give [n1_j n2_i ] / [n1_i n2_j].

But from the problem, n1_j = 2 n2_j, so substituting in:

(n1_j / n1_i) / (n2_j / n2_i ) = (2 n2_j * n2_i ) / (n1_i * n2_j) ) → (2 n2_i ) / (n1_i )

But I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps take the ratio of the excitation ratios.

Wait, another approach: since in LTE, the ratio of the populations depends only on temperature. So for each star, the ratio is n_j / n_i = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So for star_1, the ratio is R1 = n1_j / n1_i = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2, R2 = n2_j / n2_i = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Now, the problem says that the excited level in star_1 is twice as excited as in star_2. So n1_j = 2 n2_j. But how does that relate to R1 and R2?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is comparing the same energy level in each star, but relative to their own ground states. So R1 = 2 R2. Because n1_j = 2 n2_j, and n_i for each star would be different.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of the excited state population for each star relative to the same ground state. So n1_j / n1_i = R1, and n2_j / n2_i = R2.

But the problem states that for the same energy level, star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2. So n1_j = 2 n2_j.

But without knowing the ground state populations, perhaps we can take the ratio of the two excitation ratios.

Wait, another angle: Let's express R1 and R2.

R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

We need to relate R1 and R2, but the problem statement gives us a relation involving the populations. So perhaps the ratio R1/R2 = (n1_j /n1_i) / (n2_j /n2_i) ) = (n1_j n2_i ) / (n1_i n2_j )

Given that n1_j = 2 n2_j, substituting:

(R1/R2) = (2 n2_j * n2_i ) / (n1_i n2_j ) ) = 2 (n2_i / n1_i )

But without knowing the relationship between n1_i and n2_i, it's unclear. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the excited state populations in the two stars is the same as the ratio of their respective excitation ratios.

Wait, maybe the question is comparing the excitation relative to the same level. So, the ratio n1_j / n2_j = 2.

But how does that relate to their respective R1 and R2?

Wait, n1_j = 2 n2_j.

But n1_j = R1 * n1_i → n2_j = R2 * n2_i.

So, 2 (R2 * n2_i ) = R1 * n1_i → 2 R2 n2_i = R1 n1_i.

But n1_i and n2_i are the ground state populations of each star. Without more info, perhaps this approach isn't leading me anywhere.

Wait, perhaps the question can be approached by assuming that for each star, the ratio of the excited state population in that star to the ground state is given by the Boltzmann factor. So, for star 1, n_j/n_i = e^{-ΔE/(k T1)}, and for star 2, n_j/n_i = e^{-ΔE/(k T2)}.

The problem says that the excited level in star_1 is twice that in star_2, so (n_j)_1 = 2 (n_j)_2.

But since n_j in each star depends on both their temperature and the ground state population, which we don't know, perhaps I need to consider the ratio of the ratios.

Let me think: Let me write the two equations.

Equation 1: (n_j)_1 / (n_i)_1 = e^{-ΔE/(k T1)}.

Equation 2: (n_j)_2 / (n_i)_2 = e^{-ΔE/(k T2)}.

We also know that (n_j)_1 = 2 (n_j)_2.

Taking the ratio of equation 1 to equation 2:

[(n_j)_1/(n_i)_1] / [(n_j)_2/(n_i)_2] = e^{ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) }.

Substituting (n_j)_1 = 2 (n_j)_2:

[ (2 (n_j)_2 ) / (n_i)_1 ] / [ (n_j)_2/(n_i)_2 ) ] = 2 (n_i)_2 / (n_i)_1 = e^{ ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) }.

Hmm, but without knowing the ratio of the ground state populations (n_i)_1 / (n_i)_2, I can't proceed further. Maybe I should consider that the total number of atoms (n_i + n_j) is the same for both stars? But the problem doesn't state that, so I can't assume that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the same element, so the total number of iron atoms is the same in both stars? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be solved more simply.

Wait, let's think about the ratio of the populations. Let me consider that the excitation ratio for each star is given by R1 and R2, where R1 = (n_j)_1/(n_i)_1 = e^{-ΔE/(k T1)} and R2 = (n_j)_2/(n_i)_2 = e^{-ΔE/(k T2)}.

The problem says that (n_j)_1 = 2 (n_j)_2.

But without knowing (n_i)_1 and (n_i)_2, perhaps I can express (n_j)_1 in terms of R1 and (n_j)_2 in terms of R2.

So, (n_j)_1 = R1 (n_i)_1.

(n_j)_2 = R2 (n_i)_2.

Given that (n_j)_1 = 2 (n_j)_2 → R1 (n_i)_1 = 2 R2 (n_i)_2.

But (n_i)_1 and (n_i)_2 are the ground state populations, which may not be the same. So unless there's a relation between (n_i)_1 and (n_i)_2, I can't directly relate R1 and R2.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to compare the excitation ratios, not the absolute populations. So maybe the ratio R1/R2 is 2.

That is, (n_j)_1/(n_i)_1 = 2 (n_j)_2/(n_i)_2 → R1 = 2 R2.

If that's the case, then R1/R2 = 2.

So, R1 = 2 R2.

But R1 = e^{-ΔE/(k T1)}, R2 = e^{-ΔE/(k T2)}.

So, e^{-ΔE/(k T1)} = 2 e^{-ΔE/(k T2)}.

Taking natural logs:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2).

Rearranging:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2).

Factor out ΔE/k:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

Multiply both sides by k/ΔE:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = (ln(2) * k ) / ΔE.

But I don't know the value of ΔE, but I remember that k is 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, the given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, let's plug that in. So,

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (ln(2) * k ) / ΔE.

Since k is 1.38e-23 J/K, and ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. So,

(ln(2) * 1.38e-23 J/K ) / (1.38e-23 J) ) = ln(2) * (1 K^{-1} )

So,

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2).

Hmm, but looking at the options, let me see what they have.

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2).

Wait, let's rearrange 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2).

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2).

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Which can be written as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Which is option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, but wait: 1/T2 -1/T1 is equal to (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So in the equation above, that's equal to ln(2).

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Which matches option D.

So the correct equation is option D.

To solve the problem, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the population of energy states to temperature in a system in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann equation is:

\[
\frac{n_j}{n_i} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(n_j\) and \(n_i\) are the populations of the excited and ground states, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the states, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Information:
1. The problem states that the excited state population in star_1 (\(n_{j,1}\)) is twice that in star_2 (\(n_{j,2}\)), i.e., \(n_{j,1} = 2 n_{j,2}\).
2. The energy difference between the states is \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), and \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\).

### Analysis:
For each star, the ratio of the excited to ground state populations is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{j,1}}{n_{i,1}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{j,2}}{n_{i,2}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the ratio of these two equations:
\[
\frac{\frac{n_{j,1}}{n_{i,1}}}{\frac{n_{j,2}}{n_{i,2}}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting \(n_{j,1} = 2 n_{j,2}\), we get:
\[
\frac{2 n_{j,2}}{n_{i,1}} \cdot \frac{n_{i,2}}{n_{j,2}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Simplifying:
\[
2 \cdot \frac{n_{i,2}}{n_{i,1}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Since the total number of atoms is not specified, we focus on the ratio of the excitation probabilities. Assuming the ground state populations scale with temperature, the equation simplifies to:
\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Substituting \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\) and \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), we find:
\[
\ln(2) = \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}.
\]

Rewriting:
\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

### Conclusion:
The correct equation is:
\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches **Option D**.
