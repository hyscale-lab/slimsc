Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to unpack it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. Alright, I'll start by reading the problem carefully.

The state vector is given as |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Oh wait, so it's a linear combination of the spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis. But it's not normalized yet because it's proportional. My first thought is that I need to normalize this state to find the probabilities correctly.

The operator we're looking at has a matrix representation where Aij is ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, wait. So it's a 2x2 matrix, since we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles. Let me think about what this matrix would look like. For a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (where i=j) are 0, and the off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are ħ/2. So the matrix would be:

[  0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   0  ]

Oh wait, that's not right. Wait, no, because for a 2x2 matrix, i and j can be 1 and 2. So A12 = A21 = ħ/2, and A11 = A22 = 0. So the matrix is:

[ 0     ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   0 ]

Hmm. Wait, that's a symmetric matrix. So it's a Hermitian operator, which makes sense because observables in quantum mechanics are represented by Hermitian operators.

Wait, but wait again. The operator's matrix elements are Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else 0. So yeah, that's correct. So the matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

I think this operator is related to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], but the structure is similar. But perhaps it's a different operator.

But perhaps more importantly, I need to find the eigenstates of this operator. Because when you measure an operator, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the squares of the amplitudes of the eigenstates in the given state |alpha>.

So the plan is:

1. Normalize the state |alpha>.
2. Find the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the operator A.
3. Express |alpha> as a linear combination of these eigenstates.
4. The coefficients' squares will give the probabilities.
5. The average value is the expectation value, which is <alpha|A|alpha>.

Wait, or another approach is to compute the expectation value directly using the matrix elements. But since the operator is given as a matrix, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value directly once we have the state normalized.

Wait, but let me go step by step.

First, normalize |alpha>. The given vector is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let me write this as a vector: [1+i, 2 - i]^T.

The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2.

Calculating |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Wait, actually, |a+ib|^2 is a^2 + b^2. So |1 + i|^2 is 1^2 + 1^2 = 2.

Similarly, |2 - i|^2 is 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5. So the total norm squared is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2 -i]^T.

So |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ].

Next, find the eigenvalues and eigenstates of operator A.

The operator has matrix [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

To find eigenvalues, solve det(A - λ I) = 0.

The matrix is:

[ -λ     ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   -λ ]

The determinant is λ^2 - (ħ/2)^2 = 0.

So λ^2 = (ħ^2)/(4) → λ = ± ħ/2.

Wait, but that's if the matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

Now, the eigenvectors.

For λ = ħ/2:

(A - λ I) v = 0.

So,

[ -ħ/2   ħ/2 ] [v1]
[ ħ/2  -ħ/2 ] [v2]

Which simplifies to:

(-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [1, 1]^T. But we should normalize it.

The norm is sqrt(1^2 +1^2 )=sqrt(2), so the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 1]^T.

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2:

Equation (A - (-λ) I) v =0 → [ ħ/2  ħ/2; ħ/2  ħ/2 ]

So, (ħ/2)(v1 + v2) =0 → v1 = -v2.

Eigenvector is [1, -1]^T, normalized as (1/sqrt(2)) [1, -1]^T.

So the eigenstates are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively.

Wait, but the operator A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]] which is the same as (ħ/2)(σ_x), where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix. Because σ_x has entries [[0,1],[1,0]], so A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

So the eigenstates are indeed the eigenstates of σ_x, which are the same as I found.

So, now, the state |alpha> can be expressed in terms of |+> and |->.

|alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

But let's express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A.

Each eigenstate |+> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+> and |->.

Let me denote |alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->.

Expressing in terms of |up> and |down>:

c_+ |+> = c_+ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
c_- |-> = c_- (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Adding them:

|alpha> = [c_+ + c_- ] |up> / sqrt(2) + [ c_+ - c_- ] |down> / sqrt(2)

But from |alpha>'s expression, we have coefficients (1+i)/sqrt(7) for |up> and (2 - i)/sqrt(7) for |down>.

So,

(c_+ + c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
(c_+ - c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

Let me write these as two equations:

Equation 1: (c_+ + c_- ) = (1+i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)
Equation 2: (c_+ - c_- ) = (2 - i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)

Let me write sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) as 1/sqrt(3.5) but perhaps it's better to compute numerically.

Alternatively, let me square both equations to find |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to solve for c_+ and c_-.

Adding equation 1 and 2:

[ (c_+ + c_-) + (c_+ - c_-) ] = (1+i + 2 -i ) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)
2 c_+ = (3 ) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)
So c_+ = (3) / (2 sqrt(7) ) * sqrt(2) ) → wait, wait.

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

Equation 1: c_+ + c_- = [ (1+i)*sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)
Equation 2: c_+ - c_- = [ (2 - i)*sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)

Adding both equations:

2 c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)
= (3) * sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)
So c_+ = (3 * sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

2 c_- = [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= [ -1 + 2i ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
So c_- = [ (-1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7) )

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the subtraction. Let me check.

Equation 1 minus equation 2:

(c_+ + c_- ) - (c_+ - c_- ) ) = [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
Left side: 2 c_-
Right side: (1 + i -2 + i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = (-1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)
So 2 c_- = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)
So c_- = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7) )

Now, to find |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Let's compute |c_+|^2:

c_+ = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) )
So |c_+|^2 = (9 * 2) / (4 *7) ) = (18)/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, |c_-|^2:

c_- = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7) )

The modulus squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] * (2) / (4 *7) )

So [1 +4 ] * 2 / (28) ) → 5 * 2 /28 = 10/28 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, but wait. Are these the probabilities? Because the state |alpha> is expressed as c_+ |+> + c_- |->. So the probability of measuring +ħ/2 is |c_+|^2, and for -ħ/2 is |c_-|^2.

But wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357. But looking at the options, none of them have 9/14 and 5/14. Oh, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait. Let's recalculate |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

c_+ = [3 sqrt(2)] / (2 sqrt(7)) 

So |c_+|^2 = [ (3^2) * (2) ) ] / ( (2^2) * 7 ) ) = (9 * 2) / (4 *7 ) ) = 18/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Now for c_-:

c_- = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7) )

The modulus squared is | (-1 + 2i) |^2 * 2 / ( (2^2)*7 )

| -1 + 2i |^2 = (1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4 =5.

So |c_-|^2 = 5 * 2 / (4 *7 ) → 10 / 28 → 5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, but 9/14 is about 0.6428, and 5/14 is about 0.357. Looking at the options, option A has probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, which are close. Option B has 0.54 and 0.46, etc. So perhaps this is leading to option A.

But let me think again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in solving for c_+ and c_-.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation value directly.

Wait, the average value of the operator A is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Another approach: Since the operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x, and σ_x has eigenvalues ±1, the average value would be (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_x in |alpha>.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value directly using the state vector.

But perhaps I can compute <A> more directly.

The state is |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [1+i, 2-i]^T.

So the density matrix is |alpha><alpha|.

The expectation value <A> is the sum over i,j of alpha_i^* A_ij alpha_j.

Wait, or perhaps it's alpha^† A alpha.

Alternatively, since A is a 2x2 matrix, <A> = alpha^† A alpha.

So let's compute alpha^† A alpha.

alpha is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2,0]]

So alpha^† is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Multiplying alpha^† A:

= [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]

= [ (0*(1-i) + ħ/2*(2+i)) / sqrt(7), (0*(2+i) + ħ/2*(1-i)) / sqrt(7) ]

Wait, perhaps another way to compute alpha^† A alpha.

Wait, more accurately:

< A > = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7) , (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]

Breaking it down:

First compute A multiplied by the state vector.

A * [ (1+i) ; (2 -i) ] = [ (0)(1+i) + (ħ/2)(2 -i) ] = [ ( ħ/2 (2 -i) ), ( ħ/2 (1+i) ) ]

Then multiply by the conjugate transpose of alpha:

= [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ ( ħ/2 (2 -i) ), ( ħ/2 (1+i) ) ]

= (1 -i)/sqrt(7) * ( ħ/2 (2 - i) ) + (2 + i)/sqrt(7) * ( ħ/2 (1 + i) )

Factor out ħ/(2 sqrt(7)):

= ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) [ (1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 + i)(1 + i) ]

Let me compute each term.

(1 -i)(2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i)
= 2 -i - 2i + i^2
= 2 -3i -1 (since i^2=-1)
= (2-1) -3i = 1 - 3i

(2 + i)(1 + i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i
= 2 + 2i + i + i^2
=2 +3i -1
=1 +3i

Adding these two:

(1 -3i) + (1 +3i) ) = 2.

So the expectation value is ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) * 2 = ħ / sqrt(7).

Wait, that's interesting. So the average value is ħ / sqrt(7). Looking at the options, option C says average is ħ/sqrt(7), option D says 2ħ/sqrt(7), etc.

So the average value is ħ/sqrt(7). So that's one part.

Now, the probabilities. Earlier, I found the probabilities to be approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36, with average hbar/7. Wait, wait, no. Option A says average hbar/7, but we just found the average is hbar/sqrt(7). So option A can't be correct. Option C has average hbar/sqrt(7), which matches our result.

But earlier, the probabilities were 9/14 (≈0.6428) and 5/14 (≈0.357). So that's approximately 0.64 and 0.36. But option A's average is hbar/7, which is different from our result. So option C is hbar/sqrt(7), which matches.

Wait, let me check the probabilities again.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in calculating |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Wait, c_+ is [3 sqrt(2)] / (2 sqrt(7)), so |c_+|^2 is (9 * 2) / (4 *7) ) = 18/28 = 9/14 ≈0.6428.

c_- is [ (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)).

The modulus squared is [ (-1)^2 +2^2 ] * (2) / (4 *7) → [5] * 2 / (28) →10/28=5/14 ≈0.357.

Wait, but 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is 0.357, not 0.36. Hmm.

Looking at the options, option C says probabilities 0.28 and 0.72, which doesn't match. Option D has 0.61 and 0.29 which is close to 0.64 and 0.36, but no.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in solving for c_+ and c_-.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently, using the eigenstates approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the probability by finding the overlap between |alpha> and each eigenstate of A.

The eigenstates are |+> and |->, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the inner product < + | alpha > is:

< + | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [1,1] * (1/sqrt(7)) [1+i, 2 -i]^T.

Which is (1/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7))) ) [ (1)(1+i) + (1)(2 -i) ]

= (1/(sqrt(14)) ) [ 1 + i + 2 - i ] = (3) / sqrt(14).

So | < + | alpha > |^2 = 9/14 ≈0.6428.

Similarly, < - | alpha > is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [1, -1] * (1/sqrt(7)) [1+i, 2 -i ].

= (1/(sqrt(14)) ) [ (1)(1+i) + (-1)(2 -i) ]

= (1/(sqrt(14)) ) [ 1 +i -2 +i ] = [ (-1) + 2i ] / sqrt(14).

The modulus squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1 +4 )/14 =5/14 ≈0.357.

So these match our earlier results.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.6428 (for +ħ/2) and 0.357 (for -ħ/2), and the average is ħ/sqrt(7).

Looking at the options, option C says average is ħ/sqrt(7), but its probabilities are 0.28 and 0.72, which doesn't match. Option A's average is hbar/7, which is different. Hmm.

Wait, option D says average is 2hbar/sqrt(7), which doesn't match.

Wait, option B says average is 3hbar/sqrt(7). No.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the operator is (ħ/2) σ_x, so the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So the expectation value is ( <c_+> * (ħ/2) ) + ( <c_-> * (-ħ/2) ) )

Wait, but the expectation value we found earlier was ħ/sqrt(7). Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the expectation value.

Let me re-calculate the expectation value.

We have |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [1+i, 2 -i]^T.

Operator A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

So <A> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Wait, perhaps I should compute this as:

= (1/7) [ (1-i)(1+i) (ħ/2) + (2+i)(2 -i) (ħ/2) ) ]

Wait, because when you multiply [a, b] * [[0,c],[c,0]] * [d; e], you get a*c e + b c d.

Wait, no, let me think. The product would be:

= [ (1-i)/sqrt(7) , (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7); (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Multiplying the matrix A with the state vector:

A * [ (1+i); (2 -i) ] = [ (0)(1+i) + (ħ/2)(2 -i) ; (ħ/2)(1+i) + 0*(2 -i) ]

= [ ( ħ/2 (2 -i) ), ( ħ/2 (1+i) ) ]

Then, multiply by the conjugate transpose:

[ (1 -i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ ( ħ/2 (2 -i) ), ( ħ/2 (1 +i) ) ]

Each term is:

(1 -i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2)(2 -i) ) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2)(1 +i)

Factor out ħ/(2 sqrt(7)):

= ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ]

Compute each product:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)(-i) → 2 -i -2i +i² → 2 -3i -1 → 1 -3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i → 2+2i +i +i² → 2+3i -1 → 1+3i.

Adding these: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So <A> = ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) * 2 → ħ/sqrt(7).

Yes, so the average is ħ/sqrt(7).

So now looking back at the options:

Option C's average is hbar/sqrt(7), matching. But its probabilities are 0.28 and 0.72, which don't match our earlier results of ~0.64 and ~0.36.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the probability calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenstates. Let me double-check.

Wait, the eigenstates |+> and |-> are for the operator A, which is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. Are these the same as the eigenstates of σ_x? Because σ_x has eigenstates (1,1) and (1,-1), so yes, same as |+> and |->.

So the inner product calculation should be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I expressed |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->.

Wait, another approach: The probabilities are |< + | alpha >|² and |< - | alpha >|².

We found < + |alpha> is (3/sqrt(14)), so | |^2 is 9/14 ≈0.6428.

Similarly, < - | alpha> is [ (-1 + 2i ) ] / sqrt(14), so | |^2 is (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.357.

Wait, that's correct.

Looking again at the options, none of them match 9/14 and 5/14. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial normalization. Let me recheck.

The given state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>.

The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2.

|1+i|² = 1² +1² =2.

|2-i|² = 2² + (-1)^2=4+1=5.

Total norm squared is 7, so the normalized state is (1/sqrt(7)) [1+i, 2-i].

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenstates. Let me recheck.

The operator A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

The eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, correct.

Eigenvectors for λ= ħ/2:

( -λ v1 + (ħ/2) v2 )=0 → - (ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2=0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvector is [1,1], which when normalized is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, for λ=-ħ/2, eigenvector [1,-1], normalized as (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2}.

So that's correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14 ≈0.357.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7 → average is hbar/7, which is incorrect.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29 and 2hbar/sqrt(7) → average is 2..., which is incorrect.

Option C: 0.28, 0.72 and hbar/sqrt(7) → average is correct, but probabilities don't match.

Option B: 0.54, 0.46 and 3hbar/sqrt(7) → average is wrong.

Wait, none of the options have probabilities 0.64 and 0.36 with average hbar/sqrt(7).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the inner products again.

Compute < + | alpha >:

( [1, 1]/sqrt(2) ) · (1+i, 2-i)/sqrt(7) )

= [ (1)(1+i) + (1)(2 -i) ] / sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)

= [1 +i +2 -i ] / sqrt(14)

=3 / sqrt(14)

So |< + |alpha>|^2 = 9/14 ≈0.6428.

Similarly, < - | alpha >:

( [1, -1]/sqrt(2) ) · (1+i, 2-i)/sqrt(7) )

= [ (1)(1+i) + (-1)(2 -i) ] / sqrt(14)

= [1 +i -2 +i ] / sqrt(14) = [ -1 +2i ] / sqrt(14)

Modulus squared: [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = 5/14 ≈0.357.

Hmm. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Looking at the options: option A says 0.64 and 0.36, but average is hbar/7, which doesn't match our calculation. Our average is hbar/sqrt(7).

Wait, unless option A's average is a typo. But the options are as given.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the expectation value calculation.

Wait, another approach: the expectation value can be calculated using the matrix elements.

The state |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [1+i, 2 -i]^T.

The operator A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

So <A> = (1/sqrt(7))^2 * [1 -i, 2 +i] * A * [1+i, 2 -i]^T.

Wait, because (1/sqrt(7))^2 is 1/7.

Wait, but A is a 2x2 matrix, so:

[1 -i, 2 +i ] * A * [1+i; 2 -i ]

Multiply A by [1+i; 2 -i ]:

= [0*(1+i) + ħ/2*(2 -i), ħ/2*(1+i) + 0*(2 -i) ] = [ ħ/2 (2 -i), ħ/2 (1+i) ]

Then multiply [1 -i, 2 +i ] with this vector:

= (1 -i)* [ ħ/2 (2 -i) ] + (2 +i) * [ ħ/2 (1 +i) ]

Factor ħ/2:

= ħ/2 [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ]

Compute each term:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 2 -i -2i +i² → 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2 + 2i +i +i² → 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

Sum: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So <A> = (1/7) * (ħ/2) * 2 → (1/7) * ħ → ħ/7.

Wait, wait, that's different from our previous calculation. Which was correct?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, the outer product approach: The expectation value is (1/7) * [ (1 -i, 2 +i) ] * A * [ (1+i), (2 -i) ]^T.

But [ (1 -i), (2 +i) ] multiplied by A and [ (1+i), (2 -i) ].

Wait, but when you perform the matrix multiplication, it's [a b] * A * [c; d] = a*A[0][0] c + a*A[0][1] d + b*A[1][0] c + b*A[1][1] d.

Wait, but A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]], so:

= a * 0 * c + a * (ħ/2) * d + b * (ħ/2) * c + b * 0 * d.

= (a d + b c ) * ħ/2.

So substituting a=1 -i, b=2 +i, c=1+i, d=2 -i:

= [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1+i) ] * (ħ/2) * (1/7)

Which is the same as earlier.

So [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1+i) ] = (1 -3i) + (1+3i) )= 2.

So <A> = (2) * (ħ/2) * (1/7) )= ( ħ ) * (1/7 )= ħ/7.

Wait, this contradicts our earlier result where the expectation was ħ/sqrt(7).

This is confusing. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach where I thought the expectation value was ħ/sqrt(7).

Wait, let's re-examine that approach.

Earlier, when I computed <A> as the product of alpha^†, A, and alpha, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recompute that step.

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

So alpha^† is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

Compute alpha^† A alpha.

= [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

First, compute A multiplied by alpha:

A * alpha = [0*(1+i) + ħ/2*(2 -i), ħ/2*(1+i) + 0*(2 -i) ] → [ (ħ/2)(2 -i), (ħ/2)(1+i) ].

Then multiply by alpha^†:

= [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (ħ/2)(2 -i), (ħ/2)(1+i) ]

= (1 - i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2)(2 -i) ) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2)(1 +i )

Factor out ħ/(2 sqrt(7)):

= ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ]

As before, this equals 2, so:

= ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) * 2 = ħ/sqrt(7).

But earlier, when I computed using the matrix multiplication, I got ħ/7.

This is a contradiction. So I must have made a mistake in one of the calculations.

Wait a moment, perhaps I messed up the normalization factors. Let me re-express the two approaches.

First approach: The state is |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [1+i, 2-i]^T.

So the density matrix is |alpha><alpha|.

Then, <A> = Tr( A |alpha><alpha| )

Which is [ alpha^† A alpha ].

Which, when I computed, gave ħ/sqrt(7).

Second approach: Using the matrix elements, I calculated:

(1/7) [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ] * ħ/2.

Which gives (1/7) * 2 * ħ/2 = (1/7) * ħ → ħ/7.

But these can't both be correct. So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach. Let me carefully recompute.

Compute alpha^† A alpha:

= [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

Compute A * alpha:

A * alpha = [0*(1+i) + (ħ/2)(2 -i), (ħ/2)(1+i) + 0*(2 -i) ].

So A alpha is [ (ħ/2)(2 -i), (ħ/2)(1+i) ].

Now, alpha^† A alpha is:

(1 -i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2)(2 -i) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2)(1 +i).

Factor out ħ/(2 sqrt(7)):

= ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ]

Compute each product:

(1 -i)(2 -i) → 2 -i -2i +i^2 → 2 -3i -1 → 1 -3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i) → 2*1 +2i +i*1 +i^2 → 2 +3i -1 →1 +3i.

Adding these gives 1 -3i +1 +3i = 2.

So alpha^† A alpha = ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) * 2 → ħ/sqrt(7).

But in the second approach, using the matrix multiplication:

[A]_{ij} = [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]

So Tr(A rho) = sum_{i,j} rho_ij A_ij.

Where rho is |alpha><alpha|.

rho_ij = [ (1+i)(2-i)*1/7 , (1+i)(2-i)*1/7 ?, no, no. Wait, rho is a 2x2 matrix.

|alpha> is [a, b]^T where a=(1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2 -i)/sqrt(7}.

So rho = |alpha><alpha| = [ [ |a|^2, a b^* ], [a^* b, |b|^2 ] ].

Which is:

[ (2/7, (1+i)(2 +i)/7 ), ( (1 -i)(2 -i)/7, (5/7) ) ]

Wait, |a|^2 = |1+i|^2/7 = 2/7.

a b^* = (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) = ( (1+i)(2 -i) ) /7.

Similarly, a^* b = (1 -i)(2 -i)/7.

|b|^2 = |2 -i|^2 /7 =5/7.

So rho is:

[ [2/7, ( (1+i)(2 -i) )/7 ],
  [ ( (1 -i)(2 -i) )/7, 5/7 ] ]

Now, Tr(A rho) = sum_{i,j} rho_ij A_ij.

But A has non-zero elements only when i≠j.

So A_12 = A_21 = ħ/2.

So Tr(A rho) = rho_12 * A_12 + rho_21 * A_21.

rho_12 is (1+i)(2 -i)/7.

rho_21 is (1 -i)(2 -i)/7.

So,

Tr(A rho) = ( (1+i)(2 -i)/7 ) * (ħ/2) + ( (1 -i)(2 -i)/7 ) * (ħ/2 )

Factor out ħ/(2 *7):

= ħ/(14) [ (1+i)(2 -i) + (1 -i)(2 -i) ]

Compute each term:

(1+i)(2 -i) = 2 -i + 2i -i^2 → 2 +i +1 →3 +i.

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 2 -i -2i +i^2 →2 -3i -1 →1 -3i.

Wait, no: let me recompute (1+i)(2 -i):

(1+i)(2 -i) =1*2 +1*(-i) +i*2 +i*(-i) =2 -i +2i -i² → 2 +i +1 →3 +i.

Similarly, (1 -i)(2 -i) =1*2 +1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i) →2 -i -2i +i² →2 -3i -1 →1 -3i.

Wait, no, because i² is -1. So:

(1 -i)(2 -i) =2 -i -2i + (i^2) →2 -3i -1 →1 -3i.

So the sum is (3 +i) + (1 -3i) )=4 -2i.

So Tr(A rho) = ħ/(14) (4 -2i).

But wait, the trace of a Hermitian operator times a density matrix must be real, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of rho_ij.

Wait, rho_ij for i=1, j=2 is a * b^*, which is (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) → (1+i)(2 -i) /7.

But (1+i)(2 -i) = 2 -i + 2i -i^2 → 2 +i +1 →3 +i.

Similarly, rho_21 is (1 -i)(2 -i)/7 → (1 -i)(2 -i) → 2 -i -2i +i^2 →2 -3i -1 →1 -3i.

So Tr(A rho) = [ (3 +i) + (1 -3i) ] * ħ/(14) → (4 -2i) ħ/(14).

But this can't be correct because the expectation value should be real.

Ah, I see the mistake now. When I compute rho_21, it's the complex conjugate of rho_12. Because rho is Hermitian.

Wait, rho = |alpha><alpha|, so rho_ij = <alpha|i> <j|alpha> → rho_ij = (alpha_i)* (alpha_j).

So rho_12 = (alpha_1)* (alpha_2) → ( (1 -i)/sqrt(7) ) * ( (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) → (1 -i)(2 -i)/7.

Which is (2 -i -2i +i^2)/7 → (2 -3i -1)/7 → (1 -3i)/7.

Similarly, rho_21 = (alpha_2)* (alpha_1) → (2 +i)(1 +i)/7.

Which is (2 +2i +i +i^2)/7 → (2 +3i -1)/7 → (1 +3i)/7.

So when I compute Tr(A rho), it's rho_12 A_12 + rho_21 A_21.

Which is:

[ (1 -3i)/7 ] * (ħ/2) + [ (1 +3i)/7 ] * (ħ/2).

Factor out ħ/(14):

= ħ/(14) [ (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) ) ]

= ħ/(14) * 2 → ħ/(7).

So this gives <A> = ħ/7.

But earlier, using the other approach, I got ħ/sqrt(7).

So where is the mistake?

Ah, I see now. The error was in the earlier approach where I incorrectly multiplied the vectors. Let me re-examine that.

Earlier, when I thought the expectation value was ħ/sqrt(7), I think I forgot to account for the 1/sqrt(7) normalization factor correctly.

Wait, no, because in that approach, I computed:

< A > = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

Which should be correct, but according to this, it gives ħ/sqrt(7).

But now, using Tr(A rho), I get ħ/7.

So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the density matrix approach.

Wait, let me recompute Tr(A rho).

rho = |alpha><alpha|.

Tr(A rho) = sum_{i,j} A_ij rho_ij.

Only A_12 and A_21 are non-zero.

So Tr(A rho) = A_12 rho_12 + A_21 rho_21.

A_12 = A_21 = ħ/2.

rho_12 = (1 -i)(2 -i)/7 → (1 -3i)/7.

rho_21 = (2 +i)(1 +i)/7 → (1 +3i)/7.

So,

Tr(A rho) = (ħ/2) * (1 -3i)/7 + (ħ/2) * (1 +3i)/7.

= ħ/(14) [ (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) ) ].

= ħ/(14) * 2 → ħ/7.

So the correct expectation value is ħ/7.

But earlier, when I computed via (alpha^† A alpha), I got ħ/sqrt(7).

This is conflicting. So where is the mistake?

Ah, I think I see the mistake.

In the alpha^† A alpha approach, perhaps I forgot to normalize correctly.

Wait, no, because |alpha> is already normalized. So alpha^† alpha =1.

Wait, let's compute alpha^† A alpha again.

|alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

Compute A |alpha>:

= [0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

= [ (ħ/2)(2 -i) / sqrt(7), (ħ/2)(1+i) / sqrt(7) ]

Now, compute alpha^† (A |alpha> ):

= [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (ħ/2)(1 +i)/sqrt(7) ]

= (1 -i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2)(1 +i)/sqrt(7)

= ( ħ/(2 *7) ) [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ]

As before, this gives:

(1 -3i) + (1 +3i) ) = 2.

So alpha^† A alpha = (2) * ħ/(14) → ħ/7.

Ah, so this approach gives ħ/7, matching the Tr(A rho) approach.

So earlier, I must have made a mistake in the calculation of alpha^† A alpha. I think I forgot to include the 1/7 factor. Because in the earlier steps, I thought it was ħ/sqrt(7), but now clearly it's ħ/7.

So the correct expectation value is ħ/7.

Now, that's a big correction. So the average is ħ/7.

So going back, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.357.

Looking again at the options:

Option A: probabilities 0.64, 0.36, average hbar/7 → this matches. Because 9/14 is ~0.6428 and 5/14 is ~0.357.

So option A's average is hbar/7, which matches our latest calculation.

So the correct answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given as:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 
\end{bmatrix},
\]

and finding the average value of \( A \) for the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The eigenstates of \( A \) are \( |+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \), with eigenvalues \( +\frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The given state is \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize, calculate the norm:

\[
\| |\alpha\rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle\right].
\]

### Step 2: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \) are related to \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) as:

\[
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

Expressing \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \), we solve for the coefficients \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \):

\[
|\alpha\rangle = c_+ |+\rangle + c_- |-\rangle.
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \), we equate coefficients for \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) to find:

\[
c_+ = \frac{3}{2\sqrt{7}}, \quad c_- = \frac{-1 + 2i}{2\sqrt{7}}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate probabilities
The probabilities of measuring \( +\frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \) are given by \( |c_+|^2 \) and \( |c_-|^2 \), respectively:

\[
|c_+|^2 = \left|\frac{3}{2\sqrt{7}}\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad |c_-|^2 = \left|\frac{-1 + 2i}{2\sqrt{7}}\right|^2 = \frac{5}{14}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \).

### Step 4: Calculate the average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is given by \( \langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle \). Using the matrix representation of \( A \) and the normalized state \( |\alpha\rangle \), the expectation value is calculated as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
From the calculations:
- Probabilities: \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \),
- Average value: \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).

This matches **Option A**.
