Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question here about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental fate. The experiment involves a bicistronic vector with the ligand and receptor ORFs. The setup is a bit intricate, so I'll need to unpack the details.

From what I gather, the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre construct. Bicistronic means two genes in one vector, right? The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor has an IRES upstream, which I remember is an internal ribosome entry site, used for efficient translation, especially in situations where the first gene's transcription/translation might interfere with the second.

Then there are these stop cassettes. Between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between receptor and eGFP, a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different loxP variants, I think. They're used in Cre/Lox systems. So, when Cre is expressed, it recognizes loxP sites and excises the intervening DNA. But how does that work with the stop cassettes?

So the setup is probably that when Cre is present, it will excise the stop cassettes. Let me think: in the ligand part, the stop is between ligand and mCherry, so when Cre recombines, it would remove the stop, allowing the ligand to be expressed along with mCherry. Similarly, for the receptor part, the stop is between receptor and eGFP. So recombination would allow the receptor and eGFP to be expressed together.

Wait, but the vector is bicistronic, so each ORF is under its own promoter? No, I think the CBA promoter is only for the ligand. The receptor is under the control of the IRES, which is after the ligand's ORF. So, the ligand is translated first, and then the IRES allows the ribosome to switch and translate the receptor. But with the stop cassettes, perhaps when Cre is present, these stops are removed, allowing the tags (mCherry and eGFP) to be expressed along with the ligand and receptor.

Wait, maybe it's a dual expression setup. The ligand is first, with a stop, so without Cre, the ligand is expressed as mCherry-fused, and the receptor is also expressed as eGFP-fused, but with stops after each. So in the absence of Cre, the two ORFs are in separate reading frames, perhaps. But with Cre, the stops are removed, allowing the tags to be expressed together.

But maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let's think about the structure. The vector is ligand (CBA promoter) -> loxP-stop-loxP -> mCherry. Then, the IRES is upstream of the receptor ORF, followed by lox2272-stop-lox2272 -> eGFP.

Wait, so the first gene is ligand, under CBA, then a stop cassette. The second gene is receptor, after the IRES, followed by another stop cassette. So normally, without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed unless it's in frame, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps the stop cassette is in a way that the stop codon is in frame, so mCherry isn't expressed unless the stop is removed. Similarly for eGFP.

But perhaps the idea is that when Cre is expressed, it will excise the stop cassettes, allowing the tags (mCherry and eGFP) to be expressed along with the ligand and receptor, respectively.

Wait, but the question says that they transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins to test expression on Western blot. So they probably expect that either the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP are being expressed.

But then, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct in the wild-type background. They crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So, when the mice are born, the Cre is active in neural crest-derived cells, perhaps.

Wait, but in the experiment, the Western blot after transfection shows signals proportional to actin loading, which probably means the expression is working. But when they look under the confocal, they don't see a green signal, which is eGFP. So the eGFP isn't being expressed, but perhaps the ligand's mCherry is okay, or not?

Wait, the question says they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So when they do the Western, they'd detect both ligand and receptor. So maybe the vector is working, but in the mouse model, when they cross it with SOX10-Cre, the Cre is activating the expression of the ligand and receptor, but perhaps only in the neural crest cells.

Wait, but the question is why they don't observe a green signal under the confocal. So the eGFP should be expressed under the control of the IRES, which is after the receptor ORF. But perhaps the construct isn't being properly expressed.

Let me look at the options:

Option A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. That would mean they act on different cells. So if the ligand is expressed on one cell and the receptor on another, perhaps the eGFP would only be on the receptor-expressing cells. But why would that result in no green signal? Maybe in the mouse, the Cre is only active in certain cells, but the question says they crossed to SOX10-Cre, which should activate in neural crest cells. But maybe in the experiment, the eGFP is not being expressed because the construct is not active in the cells being visualized. Not sure.

Option B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. That would mean the eGFP isn't at the cell surface. But if the receptor is a transmembrane protein, it should be on the surface. If it's stuck in the Golgi, it wouldn't be expressed on the cell surface, so they wouldn't see the green fluorescence. But why would it be stuck? Maybe the tags are causing a problem. But the Western blot showed expression, so the protein is made but perhaps not properly trafficked.

Option C) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. Both are under different promoters. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, so perhaps the issue isn't the enhancer. The receptor is under an IRES, which is more of a translational element. So maybe the problem is with the expression in the mouse. But they saw expression in the Western blot, which was after transfection, not in the mouse tissues. So maybe the mouse construct isn't properly expressed.

Option D) the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Oh wait, the stop cassettes are in between. So the stop cassette has a stop codon, which would prevent the eGFP from being expressed unless the stop is removed. So if the construct isn't properly recombined, the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed. But if the mouse is homozygous for the construct, perhaps the Cre hasn't been expressed yet, so the stop is still there.

Wait, but they crossed the mouse with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10-Cre would express Cre in neural crest-derived cells, which would recombine the lox sites. So in those cells, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

But why no green signal? Maybe the eGFP isn't being expressed because the frame isn't correct when the stop is removed. No, wait, the stop cassettes would remove the stop, so the eGFP would be in frame with the receptor.

Unless the lox sites are in the wrong orientation. Or maybe the stop cassettes are in a way that when Cre is used, the frame shifts. Wait, the loxP sites are in the stop cassettes, so when Cre is present, it would excise the stop, allowing the tags to be expressed. But perhaps the eGFP is in the same reading frame as the receptor, so when the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP are in frame. If they are not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed correctly. So in that case, the eGFP wouldn't fluoresce.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that when Cre is used, the stop is removed, but the eGFP is in a different frame than the receptor, making the ORF not correctly allowing eGFP expression.

Wait, the question says that the ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor to eGFP. So that is, the ligand is expressed as ligand-mCherry, and the receptor as receptor-eGFP.

So in the vector, the ligand is first, then after the stop, mCherry. When Cre is present, the stop is removed, so the ligand and mCherry are co-expressed. Similarly, the receptor is followed by a stop and then eGFP. Cre would remove the stop, allowing receptor and eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but in the stop cassettes, maybe the stop is in the same reading frame as the ORF, so when the stop is removed, the next tag is in frame. But if the tags are not in frame, then the eGFP would not be expressed correctly.

Wait, the problem states that the vector has the ligand ORF at 5', with a stop in between, and the receptor ORF at 3' with another stop. So when Cre is present, it would excise the stops, allowing the tags to be expressed.

But in the question, after crossing with SOX10-Cre mice, the offspring are visualized under the confocal, and no green signal is observed. So no eGFP.

If the eGFP is not expressed, perhaps the stop is not being removed. But why? Because the Cre isn't active? Or the construct isn't correctly recombined.

Alternatively, perhaps the way the construct was made causes the frame to be wrong. For example, the lox sites are in such a way that when recombination occurs, the reading frame shifts, causing the eGFP to not be in the same frame as the receptor.

Wait, but the vector design is such that the ligand is first, then a stop, then mCherry. Similarly, the receptor is followed by a stop, then eGFP. So when the Cre is present, the stops are excised, and the tags are expressed as fusion proteins.

But if the lox sites are in the wrong orientation, or perhaps the cassettes aren't correctly flanked, Cre might not excise them properly. Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor after recombination.

Wait, let me think about how the stop cassettes work. The loxP-stop-loxP cassette is placed after the ligand, so the ligand ORF is followed by the stop. When Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing the downstream mCherry to be expressed in frame with the ligand. Similarly, for the receptor, the IRES allows for translation initiation of the receptor, which is followed by a stop, and then eGFP.

But wait, after the IRES, the receptor is expressed, and then the stop. So when Cre is used, the stop is removed, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but the IRES is a translational element. So the ligand is expressed under the CBA promoter, then the IRES allows the ribosome to initiate translation of the receptor. So the receptor should be expressed regardless of the stop, as long as the IRES is functional. The stop cassettes are perhaps used to allow for dual expression of the tags.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The vector is a bicistronic construct with two ORFs: ligand and receptor. The ligand is under CBA, so it's expressed first. The receptor is under the control of IRES, which allows it to be co-expressed with the ligand.

But the ligand is followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So in the absence of Cre, this would result in the ligand being expressed, but the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed. Similarly, the receptor is followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette, so without Cre, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

When Cre is present, it recombines the lox sites, removing the stop cassettes. So, ligand and mCherry are expressed together, and receptor and eGFP are expressed together.

But in the mouse model, they're crossed with SOX10-Cre mice. So the Cre is active in SOX10-expressing cells, which are neural crest-derived. So in those cells, the stops are removed, allowing both the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP to be expressed.

But the question says that under the confocal, no green signal is observed. So why isn't eGFP expressed?

Looking at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that when the stop is removed, the eGFP is not correctly in frame, so it's not expressed. But why would they not be in frame?

Ah, wait, the stop cassettes contain a stop codon, but their removal would depend on the lox sites. If the stop is removed, the frame is determined by the original ORF. So if the stop is in frame, removing it would allow the downstream tag to be in the same reading frame as the original ORF.

But if the stop is not in frame, removing it would cause a frameshift, leading to a different reading frame for the tag. So in the case of the receptor and eGFP, perhaps the stop is in a different frame, so when removed, the eGFP is not correctly in frame with the receptor, leading to a truncated protein or no expression.

Wait, but in the vector, the receptor ORF is followed by a stop and then eGFP. So when the stop is in frame, then the eGFP would be in frame with the receptor if the stop is removed. If the stop is not in frame, then the eGFP would be out of frame, leading to a nonfunctional or nonexpressed tag.

But how is the stop cassette constructed? If the stop is in the same frame as the receptor, then removing it would allow eGFP to be in frame. If not, then it wouldn't.

So perhaps the issue is that the frame isn't correct after recombination, so eGFP isn't expressed, leading to no green signal.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the IRES isn't working, but I think the IRES is supposed to allow translation of the receptor.

Wait, another thought: maybe the eGFP is fused to the receptor's C-terminus. So if the stop is in the same frame, the eGFP would be correctly expressed. But if it's not, then the eGFP might not be expressed, but the receptor would still be expressed.

Wait, but in the Western blot, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if the receptor is expressed, the Western would detect it. But the confocal is looking for eGFP. So perhaps the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed, but why?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the IRES isn't working in the neural crest cells, so the receptor isn't being translated. But the Western would have shown that if it's expressed.

Hmm. Alternatively, the problem could be that the lox2272 and loxP are different, so the Cre can't recombine them. Because the vector uses loxP for the ligand's stop cassette and lox2272 for the receptor's, perhaps. So the Cre used in the mouse (SOX10-Cre) only recognizes one type of lox site.

Wait, I remember that lox2272 is a variant of loxP that is used with Cre variants or perhaps with different Cre expression. But I'm not sure if the standard Cre can recognize lox2272. Alternatively, maybe the Cre used can only recognize loxP and not lox2272, so only the ligand's stop is removed, but not the receptor's.

Ah, that could be a possibility. So the ligand's stop cassette uses loxP, and the receptor's uses lox2272. If the Cre used (from SOX10-Cre) can only recognize loxP, then only the ligand's stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

In that case, when the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre, the ligand's stop is removed (because the Cre recognizes loxP), but the receptor's stop isn't removed (as Cre can't recognize lox2272), so eGFP remains under a stop. Therefore, the receptor is expressed, but eGFP is not. So on Western blot, perhaps the receptor is detected, but the eGFP isn't, leading to no green signal.

Wait, but the question says that the mouse is homozygous for the construct, and they used the SOX10-Cre. So perhaps the problem is that Cre can't recognize lox2272, so the receptor's stop isn't removed, hence eGFP isn't expressed.

Looking at the options, none directly mention this. But let's look:

Option B is about the construct being stuck in the Golgi. Maybe if the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop remains, but the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't. But that would fit option B only if the eGFP is not expressed due to a trafficking issue. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the original question says that the mouse is homozygous for the construct. So perhaps the construct has both loxP and lox2272 cassettes, and the Cre used can only recombine one type. So if the Cre can't recombine lox2272, the receptor's stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed. So in the confocal, no green.

But in that case, the ligand's stop would have been removed, so mCherry would be expressed. But the question doesn't mention a red signal. Hmm. Because the focus is on the green signal, which is eGFP.

Alternatively, the problem could be that the IRES is not working. But IRES elements are known for allowing translation without a Kozak sequence, so that's less likely.

Wait, another point: the vector is a bicistronic construct. The ligand is first, under CBA, then the IRES, then the receptor. So when the receptor's stop is removed, the eGFP is expressed as a fusion with the receptor.

But if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP is not expressed, so no green signal.

So why isn't the stop removed? Maybe because the Cre can't recognize the lox2272 sites. So the ligand's stop is removed (allowing mCherry to be expressed), but the receptor's stop isn't, so eGFP isn't expressed.

In that case, the reason for no green signal is that the receptor's stop isn't removed because the Cre doesn't recognize the lox2272 sites. But none of the options directly address the type of lox sites used.

Looking back at the options:

Option D) the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP is out of frame, so it's not expressed. So that's another possibility.

But how could that happen? It depends on how the stop cassette was designed. For example, the stop codon could be in a different frame, so when it's removed, the eGFP starts in a different reading frame, leading to a frameshift. That would prevent proper eGFP expression.

So if the stop is in a different frame, the eGFP would not be in frame, leading to no expression.

So in the mouse, after Cre recombination, the ligand's stop is removed (assuming the correct lox sites are used), but the receptor's stop is in a different frame, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Which would mean that the eGFP isn't being expressed because it's out of frame, which is option D.

Alternatively, maybe the stop cassettes were designed in a way that, upon recombination, the eGFP is not in frame.

So why would the stop be in a different frame? For instance, if the stop is placed such that the reading frame shifts after removal, the eGFP would not be expressed.

So the problem is that the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, leading to no expression.

So the correct answer would be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair, with the ligand fused to mCherry and the receptor fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. The ligand ORF is followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, while the receptor ORF is followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. The experiment involves crossing a mouse model homozygous for the construct with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice, but no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy.

Key points to consider:

1. **Vector Design and Cre Recombination**:  
   - The ligand ORF is followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor ORF is followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.  
   - Cre recombinase recognizes loxP and lox2272 sites, excising the stop cassettes and allowing expression of the downstream tags (mCherry and eGFP) in frame with the ligand and receptor, respectively.  

2. **Observed Results**:  
   - Western blot after transfection shows signals proportional to actin loading, indicating that the vector is functional and proteins are being expressed.  
   - However, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy in the mouse offspring.  

3. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A (Paracrine relationship)**: This refers to ligand-receptor interactions between different cells. However, the absence of a green signal is due to a problem with eGFP expression, not the relationship between ligand and receptor. This option does not explain the result.  
   - **Option B (Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi)**: If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, it would still be synthesized but not trafficked to the cell surface. However, the Western blot suggests that the receptor is being expressed, and the issue is specifically with eGFP expression, not trafficking. This option is unlikely.  
   - **Option C (Missing enhancer)**: The ligand is under the CBA promoter, a strong constitutive promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. There is no evidence to suggest that an enhancer is missing, as the Western blot confirms expression of the proteins. This option is not supported.  
   - **Option D (Receptor and eGFP not in frame)**: The stop cassettes contain stop codons. If the stop codons are not in the same reading frame as the receptor ORF, their removal by Cre would cause a frameshift, leading to eGFP being out of frame and not expressed. This aligns with the observation of no green signal under confocal microscopy.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The most likely explanation is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame after Cre recombination, preventing proper expression of eGFP. This aligns with the observed absence of a green signal.
