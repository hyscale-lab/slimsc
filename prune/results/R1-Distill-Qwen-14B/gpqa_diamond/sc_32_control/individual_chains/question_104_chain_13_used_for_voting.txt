Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines corresponds to the star's velocity towards or away from us.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. So, same star masses, same planet masses. Both planets are in circular orbits.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the shift depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period, I think. Or maybe the velocity semi-amplitude of the star.

Right, the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The velocity semi-amplitude K is what's measured. K is related to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance.

I remember the formula for K is K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ) * (1/P)^(1/3)

But since the planets have masses similar to Neptune, which is much less than the star's mass (Sun-like stars), M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, since the orbits are circular, e=0. So the formula simplifies.

The formula for K when M_p << M_star is approximately K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / (M_star) )^(1/3) * (1/(P * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The exact formula for K is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (8 * c^3) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P ) )^(1/3) )

But when M_p is much smaller than M_star, that term becomes (M_p / M_star^(2/3))^(1/3) ?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the relation between K and the orbital period. Let me see.

The velocity semi-amplitude K is also given by K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1/(P (1-e²)^(1/2) )) )^(1/3)

Since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so:

K ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/( P )^(1/3) )

But the key point is that for the same star mass and planet mass, the K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period.

Because, looking at the formula, K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3). So if K is larger, that would mean a smaller period. Because if P is smaller, 1/P is larger, so K increases.

Wait, let's think of it as K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3). So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Because K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

So, K1/K2 = 5 /7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So, (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3 = (25/49) ≈ 0.5102

Wait, no wait. Let me re-express that.

If K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3), then:

K1 = constant * (1/P1)^(1/3)

K2 = constant * (1/P2)^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, let me check:

K1 = C * (1/P1)^(1/3)

K2 = C * (1/P2)^(1/3)

K1/K2 = [ (1/P1) / (1/P2) ]^(1/3 )

= (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

We can solve for P2/P1.

Given K1=5, K2=7.

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1

So P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3

Wait wait, no. Let me see: 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

=> (5/7)^3 = P2 / P1

So P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3

Wait, but the question is asking How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So, P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1

So, P2 is (125/343) times P1, which is approximately 0.364 times P1.

So, the period of planet #2 is 0.364 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is 0.364 P1, that means P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of about 0.36. So P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter by about 0.36. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So, P2 is shorter, so the factor is 0.36.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me rephrase. P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1. So P2 is 125/343 of P1, which is about 0.364.

So P2 is 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter. So how many times longer is P2 than P1? That is, P2 is shorter, so the factor is less than 1.

So, for example, if P1 is 10 days, then P2 is ~3.64 days. So P2 is shorter, so it's not longer. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So that's the ratio P2 / P1 = 0.364. So 0.36 times longer.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.

So the answer is option A.

Wait, but let me think again. Let me make sure I didn't confuse K and the periods.

Because K is the velocity semi-amplitude. If K is larger, that implies that the star is moving more quickly, which could be because the planet is more massive, but in this case, the planet masses are the same. So a larger K must mean a shorter period, because the star's velocity wobble depends on the planet's mass and the period.

Wait, the formula again: K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) * (1/P)^(1/3 )

Wait, since M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3).

So, K1 = (constant)/P1^(1/3)

K2 = (constant)/ P2^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So, as before.

So yes, so the ratio of K1 to K2 gives the cube root of the inverse ratio of periods.

So, the conclusion is that the period of planet 2 is (5/7)^3 times the period of planet 1, which is approximately 0.364 times. So, the orbital period of planet 2 is 0.36 times as long as planet 1's. So, the period of planet 2 is shorter. The question is how many times longer is planet 2's period compared to planet 1. So the answer is approximately 0.36 times longer. So, 0.36 is option A.

The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of the planet. The velocity semi-amplitude \( K \), which is proportional to the measured Doppler shift, depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period \( P \). For stars with the same mass and planets with the same mass, \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), as given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

From the problem, Planet #1 causes a spectral line shift of 5 milliangstroms (\( K_1 = 5 \)), while Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms (\( K_2 = 7 \)). Using the proportionality \( K_1 / K_2 = (P_2 / P_1)^{1/3} \), we can solve for the ratio of the orbital periods:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of Planet #1. The question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1. Since \( P_2 \) is shorter than \( P_1 \), the factor is less than 1, and the answer is approximately 0.36.
