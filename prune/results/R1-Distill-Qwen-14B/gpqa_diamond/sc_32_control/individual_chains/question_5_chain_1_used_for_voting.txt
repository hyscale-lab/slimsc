Alright, let's try to tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Okay, so the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. 

Wait, each component is multiplied by ħ/2. Let me jot down the given matrices. 

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]. P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]], and P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]. 

So, the operator P along direction n, which is in the x-z plane. Oh right, the general form for the operator along an arbitrary direction is the dot product of the vector operator P with the direction vector n. So P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. 

But wait, since n lies in the x-z plane, the y-component n_y must be zero. So n is (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) or something? No wait, no, in the x-z plane, the angle φ would be 0 or 180, I think. Wait, no, any direction in x-z plane has φ=0, because polar angles are typically measured from the z-axis. Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of angles. Let me get this right. An arbitrary direction in the x-z plane can be represented with an angle θ from the z-axis and φ=0 or φ=π? Wait, no, actually, in spherical coordinates, any point in the x-z plane would have φ=0 or φ=π, depending on whether it's on the positive or negative x side. But since n is a direction, perhaps we can just take φ=0 for simplicity. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in spherical coordinates, x is r sinθ cosφ, y is r sinθ sinφ, z is r cosθ. So if φ=0, x = r sinθ, y=0, z = r cosθ. So yeah, n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but since n is a unit vector, r=1, so n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). 

Wait, but the operator P is along n, so P is given by n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). So P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But n_y is zero, so P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So substituting the n components, P = (sinθ)(P_x) + (cosθ)(P_z).

Each P component is (ħ/2) multiplied by their respective matrices. Let me write them out:

P_x matrix: [[0,1],[1,0]] → (ħ/2) times this.

P_z matrix: [[1,0],[0,-1]] → (ħ/2) times this.

So, substituting n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ,

P = (sinθ)( (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] ) + (cosθ)( (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]] )

Let me compute this matrix.

First, the P_x part:

sinθ * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [[0, sinθ (ħ/2)], [sinθ (ħ/2), 0]]

The P_z part:

cosθ * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[cosθ (ħ/2), 0], [0, -cosθ (ħ/2)]]

Adding these together:

The (1,1) element is cosθ (ħ/2).

The (1,2) element is sinθ (ħ/2).

The (2,1) element is sinθ (ħ/2).

The (2,2) element is -cosθ (ħ/2).

So matrix P is:

[ [ (ħ/2) cosθ , (ħ/2) sinθ ],
  [ (ħ/2) sinθ , -(ħ/2) cosθ ] ]

Now, we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is (P - λ I) |v> = 0.

So, λ is ħ/2.

So, let's subtract λ from the diagonal elements.

Matrix (P - λ I) becomes:

[ (ħ/2 cosθ - ħ/2) , (ħ/2 sinθ) ],
[ (ħ/2 sinθ) , (-ħ/2 cosθ - ħ/2) ]

Which factors out ħ/2:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ -1 , sinθ ],
          [ sinθ , -cosθ -1 ] ]

So, the matrix equation is:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ -1 , sinθ ],
          [ sinθ , -cosθ -1 ] ] 
 * [v1; v2] = 0

Since ħ/2 is a scalar, it can be divided out, so the system becomes:

( cosθ -1 ) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0
sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1 ) v2 = 0

These are two equations. Let me write them as:

1. (cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0
2. sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 = 0

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as a system of equations and solve for v1 and v2.

From equation 1:

v1 = [ - sinθ v2 ] / (cosθ -1 )

If I plug this into equation 2, perhaps we can find a condition.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. Since the two equations are linearly dependent (because it's an eigenvalue problem), they should be scalar multiples of each other. So let's see.

Equation 1: (cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0

Equation 2: sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 = 0

Let me multiply equation 1 by (-1 - cosθ) and equation 2 by (cosθ -1), and see if they are the same.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write equation 1 as:

v1 = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] v2

Because (cosθ -1 ) = -(1 - cosθ), so:

v1 = [ - sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] v2 = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] (-v2) ?

Wait, maybe I can express v1 in terms of v2.

From equation 1: (cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0 → v1 = [ - sinθ v2 ] / (cosθ -1 )

Which is v1 = [ sinθ v2 ] / (1 - cosθ )

So, let's write v1 = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] v2

But I can write 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). 

So substituting these in:

v1 = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) / (2 sin²(theta/2)) ) ] v2

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) / (2 sin²(theta/2)) ) ] v2
= [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] v2
= cot(theta/2) v2

So, v1 = cot(theta/2) v2

That's one equation. Let's now plug this into equation 2:

sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 =0

Substitute v1 = cot(theta/2) v2:

sinθ * cot(theta/2) v2 + (-cosθ -1) v2 = 0

Factor out v2:

[ sinθ * cot(theta/2) + (-cosθ -1) ] v2 =0

But since v2 can't be zero (as eigenvector can't be zero), the bracket must be zero.

So, sinθ * cot(theta/2) = cosθ +1

Wait, let me compute sinθ * cot(theta/2):

cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)

sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So, sinθ * cot(theta/2) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] * [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] 
= 2 cos²(theta/2)

So equation becomes:

2 cos²(theta/2) = cosθ +1

But cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2) -1. So substituting:

Left side: 2 cos²(theta/2)
Right side: (2 cos²(theta/2) -1) +1 = 2 cos²(theta/2)

So equality holds. So equation 2 is satisfied as long as equation 1 holds. So the eigenvector is determined by v1 = cot(theta/2) v2.

So, the eigenvector can be written as:

v = [ v1; v2 ] = [ cot(theta/2) v2; v2 ] = v2 [ cot(theta/2); 1 ]

Alternatively, we can factor out v2 and write the eigenvector as proportional to [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

But [ cot(theta/2), 1 ] can be written in terms of sine and cosine. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write the components in terms of trigonometric functions of theta/2.

Wait, because cot(theta/2) is cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2). So [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), 1 ].

But let me think about normalization. The eigenvector must be normalized. So let's compute the normalization condition.

Let me write the vector as:

v = [ a, b ]^T, where a = cot(theta/2), b = 1.

So, |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

So, |cot(theta/2)|^2 + 1 =1 → cot²(theta/2) +1 =1 → cot²(theta/2) = 0 → which can't be true unless theta is 0, which is not the case. Hmm, that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, no, wait. Because when I say v = [cot(theta/2) v2; v2 ], that's correct, but it's not normalized. So let's choose v2 such that the vector is normalized.

So, let me write the vector as v = v2 [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

The magnitude squared is |v2|^2 [ cot²(theta/2) + 1 ].

We set this equal to 1. So v2² [ cot²(theta/2) +1 ] =1.

But cot²(theta/2)+1 = csc²(theta/2) = 1 / sin²(theta/2).

So, v2^2 = sin²(theta/2) → v2 = sin(theta/2) e^{i phi}, perhaps. But since the eigenvalue is real, the eigenvector is likely real or can be chosen real, but the problem here doesn't specify, but the options include complex terms, so perhaps it's okay.

Wait, but in the given options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which looks familiar. Let me see.

Wait, maybe I can represent the eigenvector in terms of theta/2.

So, from earlier, v is proportional to [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

But cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2).

So, [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), 1 ].

Let me factor out 1/sin(theta/2):

= [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] / sin(theta/2)

So, the vector is (1/sin(theta/2)) [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

But normalization requires:

(1/sin^2(theta/2)) [ cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) ] = 1/sin^2(theta/2) *1 = 1/sin^2(theta/2) = 1 → sin^2(theta/2) =1 → which would imply theta=pi. But that's not the case for arbitrary theta. So, I think I messed up the normalization.

Wait, no. Let me compute the normalization properly.

The vector is [ a, b ] = [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]

So |a|^2 + |b|^2 = (cot^2(theta/2) +1) = csc^2(theta/2) → 1/sin^2(theta/2).

So, to normalize, we need to divide by sqrt(csc^2(theta/2)) )= 1/|sin(theta/2)|.

So, the normalized eigenvector is [ cot(theta/2), 1 ] multiplied by sin(theta/2).

Which gives:

[ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), 1 * sin(theta/2) ]

Simplify:

cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)

So, first component becomes (cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)) * sin(theta/2) )= cos(theta/2)

Second component is sin(theta/2)

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, that's it! So the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). 

But wait, looking back at the options, option C is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]. But let me check the other options.

Option D: sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2). Hmm, why the hbar factor? Because the eigenvectors are dimensionless; the operator has units of ħ, but the eigenvectors are just vectors in Hilbert space, which are unitless when considering the components.

So, the eigenvector components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So option C matches this.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem statement says the eigenvector is for the operator P along n. But wait, the given P is the spin operator. Oh right, for a spin-1/2 particle, like a muon. The eigenstates of S·n are the spin-up and spin-down states along direction n.

So, the eigenvectors are the spin-up and spin-down states. The spin-up state along n is given by:

|+n> = cos(theta/2) |+z> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) | -z> ?

No, wait, in the standard representation, the spin-up state along direction n=(sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ) is:

|+n> = e^{-i phi/2} cos(theta/2) |+z> + e^{i phi/2} sin(theta/2) | -z> 

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvector I derived earlier is correct, but does that match one of the options?

Wait, the normalized eigenvector I found is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking at option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Yes, that's exactly what I found. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), but all the options are presented in a way that may include normalization factors or hbar. Let me reread the question.

The question asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So the correct answer is option C, which matches [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but what about the other options? Let me check.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) ), which looks like spherical coordinates but not the right angle.

Option A: sqrt(2/3) hbar and sqrt(1/3) hbar? Those factors don't seem to come from the calculation I did, so probably not.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2) and sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2). Hmmm, not sure where that sqrt(2/3) comes from. Maybe if the direction is at a specific angle, but the problem states an arbitrary direction.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation? Let me go through the steps again.

The eigenvector equation led me to v1 = cot(theta/2) v2.

Expressed in terms of theta/2, and normalized, that gives [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Yes, that seems correct. So option C. But looking back, the operator is P, which is spin here, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the eigenvector is the spin-up state along n, which in the computational basis (say, |+z> and |-z>) would be expressed as cos(theta/2)|+z> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)|-z>. But wait, earlier I didn't account for the phi angle because the direction was in the x-z plane, so phi=0. So the eigenvector becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but in the general case, when the direction n has phi, the eigenvector would have a phase factor of e^{i phi/2} or something. But in this problem, n is in the x-z plane, which would have phi=0 or phi=pi. But the question says it's along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So phi could be zero, so the eigenvector components would be real, as in option C.

So, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Looking at the options, option C is exactly that.

To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are expressed as $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ is in the x-z plane, so $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{n}$ and the z-axis.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P}$
The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]
Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, and using the given matrices for $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, we compute:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
Thus:
\[
\vec{P} = \sin\theta \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + \cos\theta \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
(\vec{P} - \lambda I) |v\rangle = 0
\]
Substituting $\lambda = +\hbar/2$, the matrix becomes:
\[
\vec{P} - \lambda I = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, the system of equations is:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)v_1 + \sin\theta v_2 = 0, \quad \sin\theta v_1 + (-\cos\theta - 1)v_2 = 0
\]
From the first equation:
\[
v_1 = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} v_2
\]
Using trigonometric identities, $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, we find:
\[
v_1 = \cot(\theta/2) v_2
\]

### Step 3: Normalize the eigenvector
The eigenvector can be written as:
\[
|v\rangle = v_2 \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
To normalize, we compute:
\[
|v_1|^2 + |v_2|^2 = 1 \implies |\cot(\theta/2)|^2 + 1 = 1
\]
Using $\cot(\theta/2) = \frac{\cos(\theta/2)}{\sin(\theta/2)}$, the normalized eigenvector becomes:
\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ is unrelated to the derived eigenvector.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ introduces unnecessary normalization factors.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**.

Answer: C
