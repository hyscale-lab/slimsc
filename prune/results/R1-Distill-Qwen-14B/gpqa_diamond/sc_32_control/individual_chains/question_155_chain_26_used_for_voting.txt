Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of operators and uncertainties. But let's try to break it down step by step.

So, the problem says there's an operator P with components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these has a given matrix form in a basis of eigenvectors of Pz. The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The question is asking for the uncertainty ΔPz of the operator Pz.

Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I need to find ⟨Pz⟩ and ⟨Pz²⟩ for this state.

Wait, the state is in the eigenbasis of Pz, right? Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. Oh, but wait, the state is an eigenstate of Px, not Pz. So the state is expressed in the Pz basis, but it's not an eigenstate of Pz itself. That means when I measure Pz, I won't get a definite value, so the uncertainty should be non-zero.

First, let's write down the state vector. It's a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me denote this as |ψ⟩ = [a, b, c]^T, where a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2.

The operator Pz is given. Let me look at its matrix again. The matrix for Pz is diagonal: first element is ħ, second is 0, third is -ħ. So in the Pz basis, it's straightforward.

So, to compute ⟨Pz⟩, I need to calculate ψ† Pz ψ. Since Pz is diagonal, this should be easy. Each diagonal element is multiplied by the square of the corresponding amplitude.

So, ⟨Pz⟩ = |a|^2 * (ħ) + |b|^2 * (0) + |c|^2 * (-ħ).

Let's compute each term. |a|^2 is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. |b|^2 is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. |c|^2 is same as a, 1/4.

So, plugging in:

⟨Pz⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ)
= (ħ/4) - (ħ/4) = 0.

Oh, so the expectation value of Pz is zero. That makes sense because the state is an eigenstate of Px, not Pz, so it's a superposition of Pz eigenstates.

Now, I need ⟨Pz²⟩. Since Pz is diagonal, Pz² will have the squares of the diagonal elements. So the diagonal elements of Pz² are (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2, which simplifies to ħ², 0, ħ².

So, ⟨Pz²⟩ is |a|^2 * (ħ²) + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (ħ²).
= (1/4)ħ² + 0 + (1/4)ħ²
= (1/4 + 1/4) ħ²
= (1/2) ħ².

So, ⟨Pz²⟩ is (ħ²)/2.

Now, the uncertainty ΔPz is sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²). We've got ⟨Pz⟩ = 0, so this simplifies to sqrt((ħ²/2) - 0) = sqrt(ħ²/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/√2, which matches this calculation. So the uncertainty should be option B.

But wait, let me double-check. Did I compute everything correctly? The state is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The probabilities for each component are |coefficients| squared. So a² is (1/4), b² is (1/2), c² is (1/4). For Pz, the diagonal elements are ħ, 0, -ħ. So when you square Pz, they become ħ², 0, ħ².

So yes, each term in ⟨Pz²⟩ is (1/4)*ħ² *2 (since a and c contribute each 1/4), which totals (1/2) ħ². So sqrt(1/2 ħ²) is ħ / sqrt(2).

I think that's correct. So the answer should be option B.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ for the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The operator $P_z$ is diagonal in the given basis, with matrix elements:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = |a|^2 (\hbar) + |b|^2 (0) + |c|^2 (-\hbar),
\]

where $|a|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4$, $|b|^2 = (1/\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2$, and $|c|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4$. Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar + \frac{1}{2} (0) + \frac{1}{4} (-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, which is also diagonal with matrix elements:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 (\hbar^2) + |b|^2 (0) + |c|^2 (\hbar^2).
\]

Substituting $|a|^2 = 1/4$, $|b|^2 = 1/2$, and $|c|^2 = 1/4$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} (0) + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
