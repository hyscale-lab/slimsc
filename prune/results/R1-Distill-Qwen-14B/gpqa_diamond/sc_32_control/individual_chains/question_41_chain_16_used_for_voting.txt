Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let's try to unpack it. The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the lab.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's movement. Since light's speed in the glass is slower than in vacuum (c), I remember that the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. But wait, that's in a stationary medium, right?

But here, the medium (glass) is moving. So I think this involves some sort of velocity addition, maybe like in special relativity? Or is it more about relative motion in classical mechanics?

Wait, but the problem says to take c=1, so perhaps we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, classical mechanics doesn't apply. But v is the velocity of the glass, so I don't know if v is a significant fraction of c here. The problem doesn't specify, so I guess I have to consider it in general.

In special relativity, when you have two objects moving relative to each other, their velocities don't just add linearly. The formula is (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²), right? But wait, in this case, what's u?

Wait, in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. Inside the glass (the medium), the light's speed is v_light = c/n (since in the glass's rest frame, light's speed is c/n). But from the lab frame, how does the glass's motion affect the light's speed?

Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of reference frames. Let me consider the rest frame of the glass. In that frame, the light's speed is v_light = c/n. Now, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So I need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame.

So, using the relativistic velocity addition formula: u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/(c²)). But wait, here, u is the speed of light in the glass's frame, which is c/n. So substituting:

u' = (c/n + v) / (1 + (c/n)*v / c² )

Simplify that denominator: (c/n * v) / c² = v/(n c)

So denominator becomes 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v) / (n c)

So putting it together:

u' = [ (c/n + v) ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ]

Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.

So u' = (c/n + v) * (n c) / (n c + v )

Let me compute the numerator:

(c/n + v) * n c = c * (c + n v) = c² + n c v.

So the denominator is (n c + v) as it is.

Therefore, u' = (c² + n c v) / (n c + v)

Factor out c from numerator and denominator:

Numerator: c (c + n v)
Denominator: c (n + v/c )

Wait, wait, no. Let me see:

Wait, the denominator is (n c + v) = c (n) + v. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Let me think again.

Wait, the numerator is c² + n c v = c(c + n v). The denominator is n c + v = c (n ) + v. Hmm, so perhaps I can factor c from the denominator as well. Let's see:

Denominator: n c + v = v (n c /v + 1) → Hmm, maybe not the best approach.

Alternatively, let's factor out c from both numerator and denominator:

Numerator: c (c + n v)
Denominator: c (n + (v/c) )

Wait, wait, because n c + v = c (n) + v = c(n) + v → if I factor c out, it would be c (n + v/(c)).

So:
u' = [ c (c + n v) ] / [ c (n + v/c) ) ]

The c's cancel out:

u' = (c + n v) / (n + v/c )

Wait, but c=1, so let's substitute that in.

Then u' becomes (1 + n v) / (n + v )

So u' = (1 + n v)/(n + v )

Looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n +v), which matches our result.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the directions. The glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is in the same direction as the glass's movement.

In the glass's frame, the light's velocity is c/n (towards the observer, because when the glass is moving towards the observer, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed c/n towards the observer. So the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v, and the light is moving towards the observer at c/n in the glass's frame.

So, the lab frame sees the light's speed as u' = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ (1 + (c/n)*v ) ].

Wait, but wait a second, the direction: when the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is also moving towards the observer, then their velocities add in the same direction. So the velocity addition formula would be as I wrote before.

But in my initial substitution, I used u = c/n and v as the glass's velocity towards the observer. So yes, that seems correct.

So the answer should be option A, (1 + n v)/(n + v).

To determine the speed of light in the moving glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The glass is moving at velocity \( v \) toward the observer, and the speed of light in the glass (in its rest frame) is \( \frac{c}{n} \). Since \( c = 1 \), the speed of light in the glass is \( \frac{1}{n} \).

The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = \frac{1}{n} \) (the speed of light in the glass's rest frame), and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab. Substituting \( u = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \), the formula becomes:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{1}{n} v}{1}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Factor out \( \frac{1}{n} \) from the numerator and \( \frac{v}{n} \) from the denominator:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}}
\]

The \( \frac{1}{n} \) terms cancel out:

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
\frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option **A**. The other options do not align with the relativistic velocity addition formula or the given conditions.
