Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz, each given in terms of 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, right? So P is the sum of its components multiplied by the direction vector. Oh wait, the problem says the direction is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the operator in the direction n would be something like P·n, I think. Because the operator for a direction is the dot product of the vector operator with the direction unit vector.

So first, I need to figure out the form of the operator P·n. Since n is in the x-z plane, it can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis, right? Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero.

So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So the operator P·n would be Px*(sinθ) + Pz*(cosθ), because Py is multiplied by 0.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the operator P is a vector operator, so each component is an operator. So when you take the dot product with n, you get an operator which is the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding component of n. So Px * n_x + Py * n_y + Pz * n_z.

But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So the operator simplifies to P_x * sinθ + P_z * cosθ.

So I need to find the eigenvector of this operator corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator is in the direction of n, so the operator is (n·P) = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero.

So the operator we're considering is (n · P) = sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, wait. The operator P is a vector operator, so perhaps the operator along direction n is (n · P), which would be the sum of each component of n multiplied by the corresponding component of P.

So the operator we're interested in is (n · P) = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So that term drops out.

So our operator becomes (n · P) = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Hmm. So n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ. So the operator is sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z.

Now, each P component is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So let's write each of them:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [ [0,1], [1,0] ]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [ [0,-i], [i,0] ]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [ [1,0], [0,-1] ]

So the operator (n · P) is (ħ/2)( sinθ [ [0,1], [1,0] ] + cosθ [ [1,0], [0,-1] ] )

Let me compute that matrix:

First, expand the terms:

sinθ * [ [0,1], [1,0] ] is [ [0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0] ]

cosθ * [ [1,0], [0,-1] ] is [ [cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ] ]

Adding these two matrices:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Multiply by ħ/2, the operator becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So the operator is (ħ/2) times that matrix.

Now, we need to find the eigenvector of this operator corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, wait. The eigenvalue equation is:

(n · P) |v> = λ |v>

We're looking for λ = +ħ/2.

So let me write this as:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * |v> = (ħ/2) * |v>

We can factor out ħ/2 from both sides, so:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] |v> = |v>

So the matrix equation becomes:

[cosθ a + sinθ b,
sinθ a - cosθ b] = [a, b]

Wait, because |v> is a two-component vector [a, b]^T.

So the equations are:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let me write them as:

1) cosθ a + sinθ b = a → (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
2) sinθ a - cosθ b = b → sinθ a + ( - cosθ - 1 ) b = 0

Wait, wait, perhaps it's better to rearrange each equation.

Equation 1: (cosθ a + sinθ b) = a → (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0.

Equation 2: sinθ a - cosθ b = b → sinθ a - (cosθ + 1) b = 0.

So now we have two equations:

(1) (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
(2) sinθ a - (cosθ + 1) b = 0

We can solve this system for a and b.

Let me take equation (1):

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0 → equation (1)

Equation (2):

sinθ a = (cosθ + 1) b → equation (2)

We can express a in terms of b from equation (2):

a = [(cosθ + 1)/ sinθ ] b

But let me check the denominators. Wait, if sinθ is zero, that's a problem, but if sinθ is zero, then the direction is along z, which has some special cases.

But let's proceed under the assumption that sinθ ≠ 0. So a = [(cosθ + 1)/ sinθ ] b.

Now, substitute a into equation (1):

(cosθ -1) * [(cosθ +1)/ sinθ ] b + sinθ b = 0.

Let me compute the first term:

(cosθ -1)(cosθ +1) = cos²θ -1 = -sin²θ.

So the first term becomes [ - sin²θ / sinθ ] b = - sinθ b.

So equation (1) becomes:

- sinθ b + sinθ b = 0 → 0 = 0.

So the two equations are dependent, meaning we have one equation.

So the solutions are a = [(cosθ + 1)/ sinθ ] b.

But for non-zero b, let's let b be a parameter, say b = t, so a = [(cosθ +1)/ sinθ ] t.

Thus, the eigenvector is given by:

a = [ (cosθ + 1) / sinθ ] t
b = t

But we can factor this as:

a = (cosθ +1) t / sinθ
b = t

We can factor t, so the eigenvector is proportional to [ (cosθ +1)/ sinθ , 1 ].

Wait, let me write this as a vector:

|v> = t [ (cosθ + 1)/ sinθ ,  1 ]

Wait, perhaps I can factor out (1 + cosθ) and 1, but let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write this in terms of (1 + cosθ) and sinθ.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express this vector as (1 + cosθ, sinθ ) multiplied by 1/sinθ, but let me see.

Wait, [ (1 + cosθ)/ sinθ , 1 ] can be written as [ (1 + cosθ, sinθ ) ] divided by sinθ.

So the vector is proportional to (1 + cosθ, sinθ).

Wait, let me make sure. Let me compute (1 + cosθ) and sinθ:

If I have (1 + cosθ, sinθ), then the first component is (1 + cosθ), the second is sinθ.

But in our case, the eigenvector is ( (1 + cosθ)/ sinθ , 1 ).

So in terms of components, it's ( (1 + cosθ), sinθ ) scaled by 1/sinθ.

So the vector is proportional to (1 + cosθ, sinθ).

Wait, but to make it a normalized vector, we can compute the normalization factor.

So the norm squared of the vector (1 + cosθ, sinθ) is (1 + cosθ)^2 + (sinθ)^2 = 1 + 2 cosθ + cos²θ + sin²θ.

Since cos²θ + sin²θ = 1, this becomes 2 + 2 cosθ = 2(1 + cosθ).

So the norm is sqrt(2(1 + cosθ)).

Thus, the normalized eigenvector would be [ (1 + cosθ), sinθ ] / sqrt(2(1 + cosθ)).

Simplify this:

Each component is:

(1 + cosθ) / sqrt(2(1 + cosθ)) = sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/(2) )

Similarly, sinθ / sqrt(2 (1 + cosθ)) ) = [ sinθ ] / sqrt(2(1 + cosθ)).

But wait, I remember that (1 + cosθ) = 2 cos²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So substituting these:

sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) = sqrt( (2 cos²(theta/2))/2 ) ) = cos(theta/2).

Similarly, sinθ / sqrt( 2(1 + cosθ) ) ) = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / sqrt( 2 * 2 cos²(theta/2) )

Wait, wait, let's compute the denominator:

sqrt(2 * (1 + cosθ)) = sqrt(2 * 2 cos²(theta/2)) ) = sqrt(4 cos²(theta/2)) ) = 2 |cos(theta/2)|.

Assuming theta is between 0 and pi, cos(theta/2) is positive, so denominator is 2 cos(theta/2).

So the second component is [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / (2 cos(theta/2)) ) = sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, that's a neat result. So the normalized eigenvector components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

But wait, wait. Let me double-check that.

Yes, because:

(1 + cosθ) = 2 cos²(theta/2).

And sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So, the first component becomes:

(1 + cosθ) / sqrt(2 (1 + cosθ)) ) = sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/(2) ) ) = cos(theta/2).

The second component: sinθ / sqrt(2 (1 + cosθ)) ) = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / sqrt( 2 * 2 cos²(theta/2) )

Which simplifies to [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ 2 cos(theta/2) ] ) = sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but the options are given as the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Looking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option C says "C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))"

So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the normalization.

Wait, the eigenvector is proportional to (1 + cosθ, sinθ), and when normalized, it's [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Yes, that's correct.

So looking at the options, option C is exactly that.

The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each expressed as a $2 \times 2$ matrix multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ is parameterized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, and the operator along $\vec{n}$ is given by $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta$.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$
The components of $\vec{P}$ are:
- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$,
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$,
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$.

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ simplifies to:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right).
\]
Expanding this:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, the matrix equation becomes:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]
This leads to the system of equations:
\[
\cos\theta a + \sin\theta b = a, \quad \sin\theta a - \cos\theta b = b.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0, \quad \sin\theta a - (\cos\theta + 1)b = 0.
\]

### Step 3: Solve for $a$ and $b$
From the second equation:
\[
\sin\theta a = (\cos\theta + 1)b \implies a = \frac{\cos\theta + 1}{\sin\theta} b.
\]
Substituting this into the first equation:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)\frac{\cos\theta + 1}{\sin\theta} b + \sin\theta b = 0.
\]
Simplify:
\[
\frac{\cos^2\theta - 1}{\sin\theta} b + \sin\theta b = 0 \implies -\frac{\sin^2\theta}{\sin\theta} b + \sin\theta b = 0 \implies 0 = 0.
\]
Thus, the solutions are consistent, and the eigenvector is proportional to:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = t \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\cos\theta + 1}{\sin\theta} \\ 1 \end{bmatrix},
\]
where $t$ is a normalization constant.

### Step 4: Normalize the eigenvector
The norm of the eigenvector is:
\[
\sqrt{\left(\frac{\cos\theta + 1}{\sin\theta}\right)^2 + 1} = \sqrt{\frac{(\cos\theta + 1)^2 + \sin^2\theta}{\sin^2\theta}} = \sqrt{\frac{2(1 + \cos\theta)}{\sin^2\theta}}.
\]
Using trigonometric identities:
\[
1 + \cos\theta = 2\cos^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \quad \sin\theta = 2\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right),
\]
the normalization factor becomes:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{2(1 + \cos\theta)}{\sin^2\theta}} = \sqrt{\frac{4\cos^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}{4\sin^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\cos^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sin^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}} = \frac{1}{|\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)|}.
\]
Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The normalized eigenvector matches option **C**, which is:
\[
\left(\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right).
\]

Answer: C
