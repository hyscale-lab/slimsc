Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then, there's this part about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, and they're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm, okay. So I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. The formula for the ratio (n2/n1) is (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the spots are present, the overall Teff is lower. The ratio (n2/n1) when there are spots is lower than when there are none. So, the factor by which the ratio changes is (n2/n1)_no_spots divided by (n2/n1)_spots.

But wait, wait. The problem says the ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So, without spots, the ratio is higher than with spots. So the factor would be (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots).

So, let's think about the temperatures. The star's Teff without spots is 6000 K, and with spots, it's 5500 K. But the spots are cooler regions. Oh wait, but the overall Teff is an average. So if 40% of the surface is spots, the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is lower.

But wait, when they observe the ratio of Ti atoms, are they looking at the entire photosphere or just the spotted regions? Or maybe it's about the average. Or perhaps the line formation is in regions where the temperature is different.

Wait, the problem says "the stellar photosphere is in LTE." So the photosphere as a whole is in LTE, but the spots are cooler.

Ah, but when spots cover 40% of the surface, the average temperature is lower. So the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K. But I think that the line formation is influenced by the areas where the spots are. Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the line is formed in the regions not covered by spots, but the overall photosphere is considered to be at 5500 K.

Wait, but the problem states the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So I think the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. But that can't be, because spots are cooler than the surrounding. Hmm, perhaps the effective temperature is the average, but the actual photosphere has regions at different temperatures.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's take a step back. The problem says that when there are spots, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere's temperature is considered to be 5500 K when spots are present. But that would imply that the spots are making the whole star cooler, which may not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the star's photosphere has a lower average temperature when spots are present, but the line is formed in the regions where the temperature is lower.

Wait, no, because the problem says the photosphere is in LTE. So each region is in LTE, but the average temperature is lower. Hmm. But the ratio of Ti atoms depends on the local temperature. So if spots are cooler, the regions with spots would have a lower ratio of n2/n1. But since the overall photosphere has an effective temperature lower than before, perhaps the average ratio is lower.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present, so the line is formed in that lower temperature.

Wait, but that's not entirely correct. Spots are cooler, but the rest of the star is hotter. So the line might form in regions with different temperatures. But if the star's overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K when spots are present, perhaps that's an effective temperature, but the actual emission comes from parts with varying temperatures.

But this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to focus on the specific part about the ratio of Ti atoms. The ratio of n2/n1 is given by (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So, if the temperature changes, the exponent changes, which affects the ratio.

When the star has spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K. When it doesn't, it's 6000 K. So the ratio without spots would be (n2/n1)_6000, and with spots, it's (n2/n1)_5500.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem might not be about the entire photosphere, but about the line formation. The line in question is from a transition at 1448 Å, which is in the near UV or perhaps the blue part of the spectrum. Titanium lines are often used as temperature indicators because their ionization state and transition probabilities are sensitive to temperature.

So, the ratio n2/n1 depends on the temperature. If the temperature is lower, the ratio decreases because the exponential term becomes smaller.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500. Because without spots, the ratio is higher, so the factor is greater than one.

Wait, let me make sure. Let me denote R = (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so R increases.

So, without spots, T is 6000 K (higher), so R is higher.

When spots are present, T is 5500 K, so R is lower.

So the factor is R_high / R_low = [exp(-ΔE/(k * 6000))]/[exp(-ΔE/(k *5500))].

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, wait, because R is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), so R_high is for higher T.

Wait, let's compute it properly.

Define R1 = R(6000 K)
R2 = R(5500 K)

So,

R1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k * 6000) )
R2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k * 5500) )

We are told that R1 / R2 is the factor.

So,

R1/R2 = [exp( -ΔE/(k 6000) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k 5500) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(5500) - 1/(6000) ] )

Because the exponents subtract when dividing. So,

exp( ΔE/(k) [ (1/5500 - 1/6000) ] )

Compute the term in the exponent:

1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 - 5500)/(5500 * 6000) ) = 500/(5500*6000)

Calculate that:

500/(5500 * 6000) = (5e2) / (3.3e7) ) = 5e2 / (3.3e7) = (5/3.3) * 1e-5 ≈ 1.515e-5.

Wait, 5e2 is 500; 5500 * 6000 is 33,000,000 (3.3e7). So 500 /3.3e7 = approx 1.515e-5.

So the exponent becomes (ΔE/(k)) * (1.515e-5 )

But to compute this, we need to know ΔE. Wait, but we don't have ΔE directly. However, we can relate it to the wavelength. The energy difference between the two levels is given by the wavelength of the transition. The energy of a photon is E = hc / λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

So ΔE = hc / λ.

But wait, in the Boltzmann factor, we have ΔE/(k T). So let's calculate ΔE/(k T) for both temperatures.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the ratio R1/R2 as exp( [ (ΔE/k) (1/(5500) - 1/(6000)) ] )

But since ΔE = hc/λ, plugging that in:

R1/R2 = exp( (hc/(λ k)) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

So let's compute this.

Given λ = 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

Constants:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
k = 1.38e-23 J/K

So,

ΔE/(k) = (h c)/(λ k) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10 m * 1.38e-23 )

Let me compute that.

First compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1448e-10 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1448e-33 * 1.38e-23 = let's compute 1448 * 1.38 = approx 2000 (exact: 1448 * 1.38 = let's see, 1400 *1.38=1932, 48*1.38≈66.24 → total approx 1998.24) → 1998.24e-33-23 = 1998.24e-56.

Wait, wait, 1448e-10 m is 1.448e-7 m. So 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = (1.448 *1.38) e-30 J·m/K. 1.448 *1.38 ≈ ~2. So approx 2e-30 J·m/K.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this step more accurately.

Wait, denominator: λ * k = 1448e-10 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1448 * 1.38e-33 J·m/K.

1448 * 1.38: Let's compute 1448 * 1.38.

Compute 1448 *1 =1448, 1448 *0.3=434.4, 1448 *0.08=115.84. Summing: 1448 +434.4=1882.4 +115.84=1998.24. So 1998.24e-33.

So denominator is 1998.24e-33 J·m/K.

Numerator is h c = 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

So, ΔE/(k) = (1.9878e-25) / (1998.24e-33) ) = (1.9878 / 1998.24) * 1e8.

Wait, 1.9878e-25 / 1998.24e-33 = (1.9878 / 1998.24) * 1e8.

1.9878 / 1998.24 ≈ ~0.001 (since 1998 is about 2000, and 2000 * 0.001 is 2, so 1.9878/1998.24 ≈ ~0.001).

So approximately 0.001 * 1e8 = 1e5.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 1e5 is 100,000. But the units don't quite make sense. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents.

Wait, denominator is 1998.24e-33, which is 1.99824e-30.

Numerator is 1.9878e-25.

So, 1.9878e-25 / 1.99824e-30 = (1.9878 / 1.99824) * 1e5 ≈ (approx 1) * 1e5 = 1e5.

So, ΔE/(k) = 1e5 K? Because the units are J/(J/K) ) → K.

Wait, that can't be right because the wavelength is 1448 Å, which is in the near UV, so the energy is higher. But 1e5 K seems extremely high. Wait, but let me think: the energy levels in atoms are such that for visible light, the temperatures are around thousands of K. But 1e5 K is 100,000 K, which is way higher than the star's temperature (6000 K). Hmm, that seems problematic. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let me recompute.

Wait, denominator: λ = 1448e-10 m → 1.448e-7 m.

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So λ * k = 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1.448 * 1.38e-30 J·m/K.

1.448 * 1.38 is about 2. So approx 2e-30 J·m/K.

h c is 6.626e-34 J·s *3e8 m/s = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

So, (h c) / (λ k) = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (2e-30 J·m/K ) = (1.9878 / 2) * 1e5 K → approx 0.9939 * 1e5 → 9.939e4 K ≈ 9.94e4 K.

Wait, that's about 99,400 K. Hmm, but the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, so that would make (ΔE)/(k T) = (9.94e4 K) / (6000 K) ) → approx 16.567.

Wait, that would make the exponent (ΔE/(k T)) = 16.567, which is a big number. So exp( -16.567 ) is a very small number. That would imply that the higher energy level is much less populated than the lower one.

But wait, that can't be right because the star's temperature is 6000 K. If the energy difference corresponds to a photon of wavelength 1448 Å, which is about 0.1448 nm, that's in the near UV. Let me compute the energy of that photon.

E_photon = hc/λ ≈ 1240 eV·nm / 1448 Å → 1240 eV·nm / 0.1448 nm = approx 8560 eV. Wait, that's 8.56 keV, which is way higher than the thermal energy of a 6000 K star.

Wait, thermal energy kT at 6000 K is about 0.5 eV (since kT in eV is ~0.0862 eV/K * T → 0.0862 *6000≈517 eV, which is about 0.517 eV, since 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 J).

Wait, no, wait, 0.0862 eV/K * 6000 K ≈ 517 eV? Wait, no. Wait, 0.0862 eV/K multiplied by 6000 K is 517.2 eV. But that's way higher than the thermal energy. Wait, no, wait no.

Wait, no, I think I confused the constants. Let me correct this.

The correct formula is kT in eV is (8.617e-5 eV/K) * T.

So, kT for T=6000 K:

8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K = 0.517 eV.

Similarly, at T=5500 K, kT is about 0.517 * (5500/6000) ≈ 0.481 eV.

Wait, but the energy of the photon is hc/λ = 1240 eV·nm / (0.1448 nm) ≈ 8560 eV, which is 8.56 keV. So each photon has an energy much higher than the thermal energy of the star's photosphere. That would imply that the probability of an atom being in the upper level (level 2) is extremely low, making the ratio n2/n1 very small.

But wait, given that the transition is observed, there must be a significant number of atoms in level 2. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the transition is from a lower level to a higher level, so E2 > E1. So the energy difference is positive. The ratio is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio increases.

But wait, given the star's temperature is 6000 K and the photon energy is 8.56 keV, which is much higher than kT. So exp(-ΔE/(k T)) would be exp(-8560 eV / (0.517 eV)) ≈ exp(-16540), which is effectively zero. That can't be right because the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present, implying that n2/n1 is non-zero.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in calculating the energy. Let me recompute that.

Wait, hc = 1240 eV·nm, correct. So for λ = 1448 Å = 0.1448 nm, the energy E_photon is 1240 / 0.1448 ≈ 8560 eV, which is 8.56 keV. That's correct. But wait, that's way higher than the star's kT of about 0.5 eV. So the probability for atoms to be in the upper energy level is negligible. But the problem says that the ratio decreases when spots are present, implying that the ratio without spots is higher than with spots.

Hmm. I'm getting mixed up here. Maybe I should approach this differently. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference is much smaller than I thought. Maybe I confused wavelength with something else.

Wait, perhaps the transition is in the infrared? No, 1448 Å is near UV. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_photon.

Wait, 1240 eV·nm / 1448 Å → because 1 nm is 10 Å, so 1448 Å is 144.8 nm. Oh wait! Wait a minute, I think I messed up the units. 1448 Å is 144.8 nm, not 0.1448 nm. Oh no, that's a big mistake.

Yes, because 1 nm is 10 angstroms, so 1448 Å = 144.8 nm.

Oh! So I made a mistake in the earlier calculation, assuming 1448 Å is 0.1448 nm, but it's actually 144.8 nm. That changes everything.

So E_photon = 1240 eV·nm / 144.8 nm = approximately 8.57 eV.

Ah, that's better. So E_photon is 8.57 eV. So ΔE is about 8.57 eV.

Then, (ΔE)/(k T) at 6000 K is 8.57 eV / (0.517 eV) ≈16.56.

So the exponent is -ΔE/(k T) = -16.56.

So, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-16.56).

Wait, exp(-16.56) is a very small number. Because exp(16.56) is a huge number, so the reciprocal is tiny. So n2/n1 is very small. But when the temperature decreases to 5500 K, kT is 0.517 * (5500/6000) ≈ 0.481 eV.

So (ΔE)/(k T) at 5500 K is 8.57 / 0.481 ≈ 17.81.

So, exponent is -17.81. So exp(-17.81) is even smaller.

Wait, but that would mean that when the temperature decreases, the ratio n2/n1 becomes even smaller. So the ratio without spots (6000 K) is larger than with spots (5500 K), which matches the problem statement that the ratio decreases when spots are present.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is R1/R2 = [exp(-16.56)] / [exp(-17.81)] = exp( (17.81 -16.56) ) = exp(1.25) ≈ 3.49.

Wait, that's approximately 3.5. But looking at the options, the closest one is D) ~2.9, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Let me recompute the exponent difference.

At T1 =6000 K, (ΔE)/(k T1) = 8.57 eV / (0.517 eV) ≈16.56.

At T2=5500 K, (ΔE)/(k T2) =8.57 / (0.481) ≈17.81.

So the exponents are -16.56 and -17.81.

So R1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-16.56)
R2 = (g2/g1) * exp(-17.81)

So R1/R2 = exp( ( -16.56 ) - (-17.81) ) = exp(1.25).

Exp(1.25) is approximately 3.49.

But the options don't have 3.5. The closest option is D) ~2.9. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated (ΔE)/(k T).

Wait, let me recompute the (ΔE)/(k T) for T=6000 K and T=5500 K.

ΔE is 8.57 eV.

kT for T=6000 K: 8.617e-5 eV/K *6000 K = 0.51702 eV.

So ΔE/(k T1) = 8.57 / 0.51702 ≈16.57.

For T=5500 K: kT =8.617e-5 *5500 ≈ 0.473935 eV.

So ΔE/(k T2)=8.57 / 0.473935 ≈18.094.

Wait, wait, 8.57/0.473935. Let me compute that.

0.473935 * 18 = 8.53083. 8.57-8.53083=0.03917. 0.03917 / 0.473935≈0.0827. So 18.0827. So approximately 18.08.

So the exponents are -16.57 and -18.08.

So R1/R2 = exp( ( -16.57 ) - (-18.08) ) = exp(1.51) ≈4.53.

Wait, exp(1.51) is approximately 4.53. So the factor is about 4.5, which is option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought I had a different calculation. Hmm, perhaps I should double-check.

Wait, the difference between exponents is (18.08 -16.57)=1.51. So the factor is exp(1.51) ≈4.53.

So the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots is about 4.5, which matches option C.

But wait, earlier when I calculated the (ΔE)/(k T) for T=5500 K, I thought it was 17.81, but it's actually 18.08. So that changes the result.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of kT. Let me compute kT again.

k = 8.617e-5 eV/K.

At T=6000 K: 8.617e-5 *6000 = 0.51702 eV.

At T=5500 K: 8.617e-5 *5500 = 0.473935 eV.

ΔE is 8.57 eV.

So, (ΔE)/(k T) at 6000 K is 8.57 / 0.51702 ≈16.57.

At 5500 K: 8.57 / 0.473935 ≈18.08.

So the exponents are -16.57 and -18.08. The factor is exp( (18.08 -16.57) )=exp(1.51)=4.53.

So the factor is approximately 4.5, which is option C.

Wait, but the options given are:

A) ~1.1

B) ~7.8

C) ~4.5

D) ~2.9

So the correct answer would be option C, ~4.5.

But wait, wait a second. The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, meaning R1/R2 is greater than one. So the factor is R1/R2=4.5, which is option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought I had 3.5, but that was due to a miscalculation in the wavelength. Once I corrected that, the factor became about 4.5.

So the answer should be C) ~4.5.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(g_2\) and \(g_1\) are the statistical weights of the two levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Information:
1. **Effective Temperatures**:
   - Without spots: \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\),
   - With spots: \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\).

2. **Energy Difference**:
   The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 144.8 \, \text{nm}\). The energy difference is calculated using \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(\lambda = 144.8 \, \text{nm} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\). Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):

   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{1240 \, \text{eV·nm}}{144.8 \, \text{nm}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

3. **Thermal Energy**:
   The thermal energy at a temperature \(T\) is \(kT\), where \(k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}\). For \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\):
   - \(kT_1 = 0.517 \, \text{eV}\),
   - \(kT_2 = 0.481 \, \text{eV}\).

4. **Exponent Calculation**:
   The exponent in the Boltzmann factor is \(-\Delta E / (kT)\). For the two temperatures:
   - At \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\): \(-\Delta E / (kT_1) = -8.57 / 0.517 \approx -16.57\),
   - At \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\): \(-\Delta E / (kT_2) = -8.57 / 0.481 \approx -18.08\).

5. **Ratio of Ratios**:
   The ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels without spots to that with spots is:

   \[
   \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_2}} = \frac{\exp(-16.57)}{\exp(-18.08)} = \exp(18.08 - 16.57) = \exp(1.51).
   \]

   Using \(\exp(1.51) \approx 4.53\), the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately \(4.5\).

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases when the star has spots. The factor by which the ratio changes (without spots compared to with spots) is approximately **4.5**.

ANSWER: C
