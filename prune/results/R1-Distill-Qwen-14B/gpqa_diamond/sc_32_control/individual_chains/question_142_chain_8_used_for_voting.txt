Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives a density matrix ρ equal to half of (|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices represent the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So this looks like a classical mixture of the states |0> and |1>.

Each term in the density matrix is a projector. |0><0| is the projector onto the |0> state, and |1><1| is for |1>. Adding them together and multiplying by 1/2 gives an equal probability for each state.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubit space. Wait, qubit space is two-dimensional, right? So any qubit state can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. But how does that relate to the density matrix?

The density matrix for a pure state is a projector. For example, |ψ><ψ| would be a density matrix with a Bloch vector pointing in the direction of ψ. But when the state is mixed, like this case, the density matrix isn't a pure state. So the Bloch vector would have a different representation.

I think the general form of a qubit density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector components. The formula is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (the Bloch vector) with components (x, y, z).

So let's apply that to the given ρ. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute each component.

|0><0| is a 2x2 matrix where the (1,1) element is 1, others are 0. Similarly, |1><1| has (2,2) element 1. Adding them together, the diagonal elements are 1 and 1, so when we divide by 2, the diagonal becomes 1/2 and 1/2. The off-diagonal elements are zero.

So ρ is a diagonal matrix with [ [1/2, 0], [0, 1/2] ].

Now, let me write the general expression for ρ in terms of the Bloch vector. Expanding (I + r·σ)/2:

I is the identity matrix [[1,0],[0,1]]. The Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So r·σ = r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

Putting it all together, the expression becomes:

(1/2)[[1,0],[0,1]] + (1/2)(r_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + r_y [[0,-i],[i,0]] + r_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] )

So the matrix is:

[ [ (1 + r_z)/2 , (r_x - i r_y)/2 ],
  [ (r_x + i r_y)/2 , (1 - r_z)/2 ] ]

Comparing this with the given ρ matrix, which is diagonal, the off-diagonal terms must be zero. So (r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0 and (r_x + i r_y)/2 = 0. Wait, if these are zero, that implies r_x = 0 and r_y = 0. Because if r_x is non-zero and r_y is non-zero, the terms would not cancel out unless both are zero.

Now for the diagonal terms: (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 and (1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2. Let's solve for r_z.

From (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2:
Multiply both sides by 2: 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

Wait, both diagonal elements are 1/2, which only occurs when r_z is zero. Because if r_z were non-zero, the diagonals would be (1 + r_z)/2 and (1 - r_z)/2, which would differ. So in our case, both are 1/2, so r_z must be zero.

So the Bloch vector r has components (0, 0, 0). Because r_x and r_y are zero, and r_z is zero.

Wait, but wait a second. The Bloch sphere is for pure states, right? Because the density matrix for a pure state has trace 1 and is idempotent. But in this case, the given ρ is a completely mixed state. For a single qubit, the completely mixed state is (I)/2. So ρ is (I)/2, which means the Bloch vector is zero. Because when r is zero, the density matrix becomes (I + 0)/2 = I/2, which matches our ρ.

So the geometrical position is at the origin. So looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which must be the correct answer.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit, where the system has equal probability of being in the states \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\). To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. 

For a general qubit density matrix, the Bloch vector \(r = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is related to the density matrix by:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + r \cdot \sigma \right),
\]

where \(\sigma = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Expanding this, the density matrix becomes:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 + r_z & r_x - i r_y \\
r_x + i r_y & 1 - r_z
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The given \(\rho\) is diagonal with equal diagonal elements \(\frac{1}{2}\) and zero off-diagonal elements. Comparing this with the general form, the off-diagonal terms \((r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0\) and \((r_x + i r_y)/2 = 0\) imply \(r_x = 0\) and \(r_y = 0\). Additionally, the diagonal terms \((1 + r_z)/2 = \frac{1}{2}\) and \((1 - r_z)/2 = \frac{1}{2}\) imply \(r_z = 0\). 

Thus, the Bloch vector \(r\) is \((0, 0, 0)\), meaning the density matrix corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere. This represents the completely mixed state, which is consistent with the given \(\rho\).

The correct answer is:
