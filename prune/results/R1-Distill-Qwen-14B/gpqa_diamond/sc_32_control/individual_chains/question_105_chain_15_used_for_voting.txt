Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and some spots on it. The scenario is being compared to an exoplanet's effect on the star's brightness. The main goal is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spots do.

Alright, let's break down the problem.

The star has the same radius as the Sun. So Rstar is R_sun. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. Now, one hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. So the filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere's surface covered by spots.

The temperature difference between the spots and the rest of the star is 1000 K. So the spots are cooler: their temperature is 6000K - 1000K = 5000K.

Because the star is rotating, only one hemisphere is spotty, so when we observe it, the brightness changes as the spots rotate into and out of view. This creates a periodic modulation in the star's light curve, similar to the dip caused by a transiting exoplanet.

The question is, if the star wasn't spotted, what would the radius of a planet (Rpl) need to be to produce the same amplitude in the light curve?

Hmm, okay, so I need to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to that caused by a planet transit.

First, I remember that the brightness variation (the depth of the dip in the light curve) depends on the area of the object blocking the light. For a planet transiting a star, the depth is proportional to (Rpl/Rstar)^2. That's because the area blocked is πRpl², and the star's area is πRstar², so the fraction is (Rpl/Rstar)².

But wait, in this case, the spots are causing a variation, not a complete eclipse. So I need to compute the net change in the star's brightness due to these spots.

Let me think about how the spots affect the total brightness. The spots are cooler, so when they are on the visible hemisphere, they make the star appear a bit dimmer. The brightness variation comes from the change as spots rotate into and out of view.

Wait, but the problem says that the observed brightness variation (due to the spots) is the same as what a planet would cause. So I need to compute the amplitude of the brightness variation from the spots and set that equal to the variation from a planet, then solve for Rpl.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about the equivalent area that would cause the same dip. Since the planet blocks a certain fraction of the light, the same dip would require the same area coverage, but perhaps I'm missing something about the temperature.

Wait a second, the star's brightness isn't just the sum of the entire surface's emission. Each part of the star emits based on its temperature. So the spots contribute less flux than the surrounding.

So when the star rotates, some spots come into view (on the front hemisphere) and others are on the back. But in this case, the star only has one hemisphere with spots. So perhaps when the star is viewed from Earth, the spots are on the visible side, and when it rotates, they move out of view.

Wait, no. The problem states that only one hemisphere is spotty. So during rotation, the spots come into view and then go out of view as the star spins. So the light curve would vary as the spots' area visible from Earth changes.

So to compute the brightness variation, I need to find the maximum and minimum brightness and find the amplitude (the difference between them).

But the star's brightness is not uniform due to the spots. Without any spots, the brightness would be the standard Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But with spots, part of the surface is cooler, so the total flux is less.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the spots come into view. Let me model this.

The star is a sphere with a radius Rstar. One hemisphere has spots covering 20% of it. So the area of the star's surface covered by spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) ) because a hemisphere is 2π steradians. Wait, no, the surface area of a sphere is 4πR². The hemisphere is 2πR². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait, but in the case of a rotating star, when the spots are on the day side (facing Earth), they contribute less flux, and when they are on the night side, we don't see them. So the variation in brightness comes from the spots being in the visible hemisphere or not.

Wait, but the problem says that the star has one hemisphere covered in spots, and as it rotates, that hemisphere comes into view. So the maximum brightness would be when the hemisphere without spots is facing us, and the minimum when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible.

Wait, no. Because the star is rotating, the amount of spotted area visible depends on how much of the spotted hemisphere is in our line of sight as it rotates.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model the star's brightness as a function of the fraction of the spotted hemisphere that's visible.

But wait, considering that the star is a sphere, and when it's viewed edge-on, the spots on the limb (the edges) would only partially block the view, but for a star, the entire surface is emitting light, so the flux from a point on the surface is based on its temperature. So when the star rotates, the spots may come into the line of sight and contribute less flux than the non-spotted areas.

This seems a bit complicated, perhaps I should approach it using the concept of brightness variation due to the spots.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: the maximum brightness occurs when no spots are visible (all unspotted surface is visible), and the minimum when all the spots are visible (the entire spotted hemisphere is in view). Wait, but the star is a sphere, so when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire 0.4π R² area (the 20% of a hemisphere) is visible. But wait, the area visible from Earth as the star rotates is a bit tricky.

Wait, maybe I should think about the flux from the star when the spots are on the front and when they are on the back.

The total flux from the star without any spots would be F0 = σTeff^4 * 4πRstar². Because the Stefan-Boltzmann law for a black body is L = 4πR²σT^4, and flux is L/(4πd²), but when considering the star's own flux, it's often computed per unit area.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-state this.

The star's total flux without spots is F0 = σTeff^4 * area. The area being the entire surface area of the star: 4πRstar². So F0 = 4πRstar² * σTeff^4.

When spots are present, the flux is less because the spotted area emits less. The flux from the spots is F_spots = area_spots * σT_spot^4. The rest of the area emits at the star's temperature, so F_rest = (total_area - area_spots) * σTeff^4.

So the total flux with the spots is F_total = F_rest + F_spots.

But wait, when the star rotates, the area of the spots visible from Earth changes. When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots, and when it's not, we see less or none.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the spots rotate into and out of view. But since the star is a sphere, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots. When it's not, we see none. So the maximum flux is F0, and the minimum is when the spots are fully visible.

Wait, no. Because the spots are on one hemisphere, when the star rotates, we see the spotted hemisphere either facing us or not. So the flux would vary between F0 (no spots visible) and F0 - (flux from the spots when they're all visible).

Wait, that can't be correct because when the spots are on the visible hemisphere, the star's flux is F0 - (F_spots - F_non_spots). Because the spots contribute less.

Wait, I think I'm getting tangled here. Let me try a different approach. Let me compute the change in flux when the spots are present.

When the star is unspotted (no spots visible), the flux is F0 = 4πRstar² σ (6000)^4.

When the star is fully spotted (the entire spotted area is visible), the flux is F_spotted = (4πRstar² - area_spots) * σ (6000)^4 + area_spots * σ (5000)^4.

Because the area_spots is emitting at a lower temperature.

The difference in flux is F0 - F_spotted.

Wait, but when the spots are visible, the total flux is F_spotted, and when they are not, it's F0. So the change in flux is ΔF = F0 - F_spotted.

The amplitude of the brightness variation would be this ΔF, and the dip would be ΔF / F0.

Wait, no, actually, the dip is when the star is less bright. So when the spots are visible, the flux is F_spotted, which is less than F0.

So the dip is (F0 - F_spotted) / F0.

But wait, the question is about the amplitude of the variations. So when the spots rotate into view, the flux drops, and when they rotate out, it returns to F0. So the amplitude is the change from the maximum to the minimum, which is (F0 - F_spotted) / F0.

So let me compute F_spotted.

Area of the star's surface: 4πRstar².

Area of the spots: 0.2 * (2π Rstar²) ) = 0.4 π Rstar². Because a hemisphere is 2π steradians, and 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So area_spots = 0.4 π Rstar².

So F_spotted = (4π Rstar² - 0.4 π Rstar²) * σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π Rstar² * σ (5000)^4.

Simplify that.

= (3.6 π Rstar²) * σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π Rstar² σ (5000)^4.

So factoring out π Rstar² σ, we have:

F_spotted = π Rstar² σ [ 3.6 (6000)^4 + 0.4 (5000)^4 ]

F0 = 4 π Rstar² σ (6000)^4.

So the dip is (F0 - F_spotted)/F0.

Compute F0 - F_spotted:

= 4 π R² σ (6000^4) - [ 3.6 π R² σ (6000^4) + 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4) ]

= π R² σ [4 *6000^4 - 3.6*6000^4 - 0.4*5000^4 ]

= π R² σ [ (4-3.6)*6000^4 - 0.4*5000^4 ]

= π R² σ [ 0.4 *6000^4 - 0.4*5000^4 ]

= 0.4 π R² σ [6000^4 -5000^4 ]

So (F0 - F_spotted)/F0 = [ 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [4 π R² σ (6000^4) ]

Simplify:

= (0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / (4 *6000^4 )

= (0.4 ( (6000^4) - (5000^4) )) / (4 *6000^4 )

Let me compute the terms:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 1.296e15 - 6.25e14 = (1.296 - 0.625) e15 = 0.671e15 = 6.71e14.

So putting that back in:

(0.4 * 6.71e14) / (4 * 1.296e15 )

Numerator: 0.4 *6.71e14 = 2.684e14.

Denominator:4 *1.296e15 =5.184e15.

So the ratio is 2.684e14 /5.184e15 = approx 0.0517.

So the dip when the spots are fully visible is about 5.17% of the star's brightness.

So the amplitude of the variation is about 5.17% of the star's brightness.

Now, the question is, what radius of a planet would cause the same amplitude when it transits the star?

The dip caused by a planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * 100%, since the area blocked is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 of the star's area.

So to get the same dip of approximately 5.17%, we set (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.0517) ≈ sqrt(0.05) is about 0.2236, but let me compute 0.0517.

Compute sqrt(0.0517): Let's approximate.

0.0517 = 5.17e-2.

The square root is sqrt(5.17) * 1e-1.

sqrt(5.17) is approximately 2.274, so 2.274 * 0.1 = 0.2274.

So Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.227.

Looking at the options:

Option D is ~0.32.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a miscalculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, the dip is 5.17% of the star's brightness. The planet's dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. So 0.0517 = (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.227.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) ~0.11, which is about half of that. Hmm, maybe I messed up somewhere.

Wait, wait a minute. Did I model the dip correctly?

Wait, the dip for the planet is when the planet transits in front of the star, blocking some of the light. So the dip is proportional to (Rpl + Rstar)^2, but since Rpl is much smaller than Rstar, it's approximately Rpl^2 / Rstar^2.

But in the case of the spots, the dip is 5.17% of F0.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation when computing F_spotted and F0.

Let me go back.

F_spotted:

When the star is fully spotted, the flux is (3.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4 ) * π R^2 σ.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in F_spotted.

Wait, the area without spots is 4π R^2 minus 0.4 π R^2, which is 3.6 π R^2, right? So those areas contribute at 6000 K. The spots contribute at 5000 K and area 0.4 π R².

So F_spotted = (3.6 π R²) σ (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R²) σ (5000)^4.

F0 is 4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

So ΔF = F0 - F_spotted = (4 π R² σ 6000^4) - [3.6 π R² σ 6000^4 +0.4 π R² σ 5000^4 ].

Simplify:

ΔF = (0.4 π R² σ 6000^4 ) - (0.4 π R² σ 5000^4 )

= 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

So the dip is ΔF / F0 = [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [4 *6000^4 ]

Which is [ (0.4)(6000^4 -5000^4) ] / (4 *6000^4 )

As before, 6000^4 = 1.296e15, 5000^4=6.25e14.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 1.296e15 - 6.25e14 = 6.71e14.

So 0.4 *6.71e14 = 2.684e14.

Divide by 4*1.296e15 = 5.184e15.

2.684e14 /5.184e15 = 0.0517, which is 5.17% as before.

So that part is correct.

So the dip is 5.17%, so the planet's dip should be the same, so (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517.

So Rpl = Rstar * sqrt(0.0517) ≈ Rstar * 0.227.

Looking at the options, 0.227 is approximately 0.23, but the options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Hmm, none of them are close to 0.23. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about the maximum dip but the variation in brightness as the star rotates. Because the star's spots are on one hemisphere, and as it rotates, the amount of spotted area visible varies.

Wait, perhaps I assumed that the entire spotted hemisphere is visible, which might not be the case. Because when the star is viewed from Earth, the spots would come into view as the star rotates, but perhaps only a certain portion is visible at any time, depending on the viewing angle.

Wait, but the problem states that the star is observed in photometric time-series, so it's observing the star as it rotates, and the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the maximum area of the spots is visible; when it's not, the spots are on the far side, and we don't see them.

Wait, perhaps the variation isn't just a single dip but a modulation where the spots come into view and then go out of view, causing a periodic change in brightness.

Wait, but in that case, the star's brightness would vary between F0 and F_spotted as the spotted hemisphere comes into view and moves away.

If the star is only showing one hemisphere, perhaps the variation is between F0 and F_spotted, but maybe the situation is more complex.

Wait, perhaps the star when viewed edge-on would show a dip when the spots are on the near side, but when viewed face-on, the dip would be minimal.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again about the setup.

The star's one hemisphere is covered in spots. So when we observe the star, the spots are on the front or the back, depending on the star's rotation.

Wait, perhaps the star's rotation causes the spots to come into and go out of the observer's view, leading to a sinusoidal variation in brightness.

So the brightness variation would be a function of the angle θ, where θ is the rotation angle, from 0 to 360 degrees.

At θ=0, the entire spotted hemisphere is facing the observer, so the maximum area of spots is visible.

At θ=180 degrees, the spotted hemisphere is on the far side, so no spots are visible.

So the brightness would vary between F0 (no spots visible) and F_spotted (all spots visible), but perhaps the variation is not as straightforward because the area of spots visible depends on θ.

Wait, actually, when the star is viewed from an angle, the amount of spots visible depends on the observer's line of sight. The maximum area of spots visible is when the center of the spotted hemisphere is aligned with the observer.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model the variation using the area of the spots that's visible as the star rotates.

The maximum area of spots visible is when the center of the spotted hemisphere is facing us. The minimum is when the center is facing away, so we see no spots.

Wait, but the star is a sphere, and the spots cover a certain fraction of the hemisphere. So the area of the spots visible depends on the rotation angle.

But perhaps, for simplicity, the variation in brightness is modeled as a sinusoidal function with an amplitude equal to the difference between F0 and F_spotted.

So the maximum dip is 5.17%, so the amplitude of the brightness variation is 5.17% of the star's flux.

So the planet's transit should cause the same dip, which would require (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517, so Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.227.

But looking at the options, I don't see 0.23. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the flux.

Let me recompute the ratio.

Compute the ratio again:

(0.4*(6000^4 -5000^4)) / (4*6000^4 )

= (0.4*( (6000^4) - (5000^4) )) / (4 *6000^4 )

Let me compute 6000^4 and 5000^4 accurately.

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = (6^4) * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 1.296e15 - 6.25e14 = 1.296e15 - 0.625e15 = 0.671e15 = 6.71e14.

So 0.4 *6.71e14 = 2.684e14.

Denominator: 4 *1.296e15 = 5.184e15.

So 2.684e14 /5.184e15 = approximately 0.0517, as before.

So maybe the problem is that I'm not considering that the planet's effect is only during transit, but the star's spots cause a continuous variation.

Wait, but the question says that the brightness variation due to the spots is similar to that due to a planet. So perhaps the amplitude of the variation is the same.

Wait, but what's the amplitude of the variation in the star's brightness as it rotates? If the star's brightness varies from F0 (no spots visible) to F_spotted (all spots visible), that's a variation of 5.17%.

So the amplitude is 5.17% of F0.

So the planet's transit must cause a dip of 5.17% of F0. So the planet's area must block 5.17% of the star's light, which implies (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517, so Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.227.

But none of the options are near 0.23. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area of the spots. The problem states that the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So the area of each spot is 20% of that hemisphere.

Wait, a hemisphere is 2π R², so the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, but when the star is rotating, the visible area of the spots varies. So perhaps the dip isn't just a single step but a sinusoidal variation.

Wait, perhaps the brightness variation is not just one dip but a modulation over the rotation period. So the amplitude would be the maximum variation caused by the change in the visible area of the spots.

Wait, perhaps the photometric variation would have a certain amplitude that depends on how much of the spotted hemisphere is visible as it rotates.

Hmm, maybe I can model the brightness as a function of the rotation angle θ, where θ=0 is when the center of the spotted hemisphere is facing us, and θ=180 when it's facing away.

The area of the spots visible would be the area of the circle where the spots are on the near side of the star.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the change in brightness is modeled as a sinusoidal function, and the amplitude depends on the size of the spots and their temperature difference.

Wait, perhaps the maximum variation in brightness (the amplitude) occurs when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible (θ=0) and when it's not (θ=180). So the maximum change in flux is F0 - F_spotted, as I calculated before.

But perhaps this isn't the case. Maybe the maximum variation is when a certain part of the spots is visible, leading to a smaller dip.

Alternatively, perhaps the average brightness is F_avg = (F0 + F_spotted)/2, so the variation is around this average.

Wait, but the problem says that the star's brightness varies periodically due to rotation. So the variation is a sinusoidal-like curve, perhaps, with a certain amplitude.

Wait, perhaps the brightness variation is not a sudden dip but a more gradual change, leading to a certain amplitude of variation.

Wait, perhaps I should model the flux as a function of the rotation angle θ, where θ is the angle from the line of sight to the center of the star.

The area of the spotted hemisphere that's visible is the area where the spot's surface is within the observer's view.

But this is getting complicated. Let me think differently.

The brightness variation caused by the spots would be a periodic function with a certain amplitude. The amplitude is the maximum change in brightness from the mean.

The mean brightness would be the average of the star's brightness when the spotted hemisphere is partially visible.

Wait, perhaps the average flux is (F0 + F_spotted ) /2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness when viewed at any given time is a mix of the non-spotted and spotted areas, depending on the viewing angle.

Wait, but perhaps an alternative approach is better. The problem is about the amplitude of the brightness variation. The star's brightness varies because the spots are rotating into and out of view. The amplitude of this variation depends on the size and temperature of the spots.

The planet's transit would cause a dip proportional to (Rpl/Rstar)^2. The problem is to find Rpl such that this dip is the same as the amplitude of the star's variation due to the spots.

So perhaps I should compute the amplitude of the star's brightness variation due to the spots, and then equate that to the planet's dip.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I need to find the change in the star's brightness as a function of rotational phase. The maximum change would be when the entire spotted area is visible, and when it's not.

But earlier, I found that this change is 5.17% of F0.

So the amplitude of the star's brightness variation is approximately 5.17% of F0.

So the planet's dip must also be 5.17% of F0. So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517, so Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.227.

But looking at the options, the closest is option D) ~0.32, which is about 0.32, which is larger than 0.227.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the brightness variation.

Wait, perhaps the star's brightness isn't just F0 minus F_spotted. Because the spots are on one hemisphere, when the star rotates, the amount of spotted area visible varies, so the brightness change is more gradual.

Wait, perhaps the variation in brightness isn't a simple dip but a sinusoidal variation, leading to a certain amplitude.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness variation is such that the amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) ~0.39 → 0.39^2=0.152 → 15.2% dip.

B) ~0.07 → 0.0049 → 0.49% dip.

C) ~0.11 → 0.0121 → ~1.2% dip.

D) ~0.32 → 0.1024 → ~10.24% dip.

Earlier, I calculated a 5.17% dip. The closest option is B) 0.07, which would be (0.07)^2=0.0049, 0.49% dip. That's way smaller than 5%. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-examine the spot area and the calculation of the flux difference.

Wait, the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere.

So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2π R²) ) = 0.4π R².

But perhaps the star's radius is the same as the Sun's, which is R_sun. So Rstar = R_sun.

So F0 = 4π R_sun² σ (6000)^4.

F_spotted = (4π R_sun² - 0.4 π R_sun²) * σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R_sun² σ (5000)^4.

= (3.6 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

So F0 =4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

ΔF = F0 - F_spotted.

= 4 π R² σ (6000)^4 - [3.6 π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4 ]

= (4 -3.6) π R² σ (6000)^4 - 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

= 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Which is the same as before.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the fraction of the star's flux that is contributed by the spots. When the spots are visible, the total flux is:

F_total = F_unspotted + F_spots.

F_unspotted = (4π R² - A_spots) * σ (6000)^4.

F_spots = A_spots * σ (5000)^4.

So when the star is viewed such that the entire spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_total.

The change in flux from when the spots are not visible (F0) is:

ΔF = F0 - F_total.

Which is:

ΔF = F0 - [ (4π R² - A_spots) σ (6000)^4 + A_spots σ (5000)^4 ]

= A_spots [ σ (6000)^4 - σ (5000)^4 ]

= A_spots σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Which is the same as before.

So the dip is (ΔF)/F0 = [ A_spots σ (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [4 π R² σ (6000^4) ]

= [ A_spots (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [4 π R² 6000^4 ]

But A_spots is 0.4 π R².

So plugging that in:

= [0.4 π R² (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / [4 π R² 6000^4 ]

= 0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4) / (4 *6000^4 )

Which brings us back to the same calculation.

So I think the dip is indeed about 5.17%.

But looking at the options, there's no option with ~0.227. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation when the star is rotating, considering that the spots are on one hemisphere. So the variation isn't just a single dip but a sinusoidal variation, and the amplitude is the maximum change in brightness.

Wait, perhaps the variation in brightness is more accurately modeled as a sinusoidal function with an amplitude of (F_max - F_min)/2.

Wait, but F_max would be when no spots are visible (F0), and F_min would be when all spots are visible (F_spotted). So the variation would be between F0 and F_spotted, which is a dip of 5.17%.

So perhaps the amplitude is 5.17% of F0, which is the same as the dip from the planet.

But then the planet's dip would be (Rpl^2/Rstar^2) = 0.0517, leading to Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.227.

But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the filling factor. Wait, the filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2π Rstar² ), which is 0.4 π Rstar².

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the problem differently. Maybe the brightness variation due to the spots is the same as the planet’s, but without considering the temperature difference.

Wait, alternative approach: Compute the relative brightness change when the planet transits. It would be (Rpl^2)/(Rstar^2).

The brightness change due to the spots when they are fully visible is (A_spots / A_star) * (T_spot^4 - T_star^4 ) / T_star^4.

Wait, perhaps that's another way to model it.

So the relative dip is (A_spots / A_star) * (T_spot^4 / T_star^4 - 1 ).

Wait, A_spots is 0.4 π Rstar².

A_star is 4 π Rstar².

So A_spots/A_star = 0.4 π R² /4 π R² = 0.1.

So (A_spots/A_star) * ( (T_spot / T_star )^4 - 1 )

= 0.1 * ( (5000/6000)^4 -1 )

= 0.1 * ( (5/6)^4 -1 )

Compute (5/6)^4: (5^4)/(6^4) = 625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So 0.482253 -1 = -0.517747.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.1 * (-0.517747) = -0.0517747.

So the dip is approximately 5.177% as before.

So the planet's dip should be 5.177% of the star's flux, leading to Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.227.

But again, no option is close to that.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read it.

The problem says: "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e., Rpl/Rstar)?"

So the star's light curve without spots would show a dip when the planet transits, with amplitude (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

The situation with the spots produces a similar-looking light curve (due to rotation), and the amplitude of that variation is the same as the planet's dip.

So perhaps the amplitude is 5.17%, and the planet's dip is that, leading to Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.227.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, another thought: The spots cause a variation in brightness, but perhaps the amplitude is not just the dip but the peak-to-peak variation.

Wait, the peak-to-peak would be from F0 to F_spotted and back, so the amplitude would be (F0 - F_spotted) * 2 / (F0 + F_spotted).

Wait, no. The amplitude in a periodic function is the maximum deviation from the mean. So if the mean is (F0 + F_spotted)/2, then the amplitude is (F0 - F_spotted)/2.

So the amplitude would be (5.17% of F0)/2 ≈ 2.585%.

So the planet's dip would need to be 2.585%, which is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.02585 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.1608.

Still not matching any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude is the maximum change in brightness, which is 5.17%, so the planet's dip is 5.17%.

But that brings us back to Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.227.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) 0.39 → ~39% → 0.39^2 = 0.15 → 15% dip.

B) 0.07 → ~7% → 0.0049 → 0.49% dip.

C) 0.11 → ~11% → 0.0121 → 1.21% dip.

D) 0.32 → ~32% → 0.1024 → 10.24% dip.

But my calculation says ~5.17% dip, which would correspond to Rpl/Rstar ~0.227, which is not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the dip.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't considering the star's entire surface. Let me think again.

Wait, the star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K.

The filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere, so the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R².

So the total flux when the spots are visible is F_spotted = (3.6 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4.

So F_spotted = σ π R² [3.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(5000)^4 ]

F0 = σ 4 π R² (6000)^4.

So the ratio F_spotted / F0 is:

[3.6 *6000^4 +0.4 *5000^4 ] / [4 *6000^4 ].

Compute numerator:

3.6 *6000^4 =3.6*1.296e15=4.6656e15.

0.4*5000^4=0.4*6.25e14=2.5e14.

Total numerator=4.6656e15 + 2.5e14=4.9156e15.

Denominator=4 *1.296e15=5.184e15.

So F_spotted/F0 = 4.9156e15 /5.184e15 ≈ 0.948.

So F_spotted is 94.8% of F0, which implies a dip of 5.2% (since 100% -94.8% =5.2%).

So that matches the earlier calculation.

Hmm. So the dip is 5.2% of F0.

So the planet's dip should be 5.2%, requiring Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.052)≈0.228.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spots are only on one hemisphere, and when the star rotates, only a portion of the spots is visible, leading to a smaller dip.

Wait, but when the star is viewed edge-on, the entire hemisphere is visible, so the maximum dip is 5.2%. But perhaps the observed dip is smaller because the star's rotation axis isn't perfectly edge-on, but that's not given in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the spots are on one hemisphere, but the star's rotation causes the spots to only cover a certain part of the star's disk as seen from Earth, making the brightness variation different.

Wait, perhaps the area of the spots visible depends on the rotation angle, leading to a sinusoidal variation in brightness.

In that case, the amplitude of the brightness variation would be the maximum change in flux divided by 2.

Wait, but earlier calculations show that the maximum dip is 5.2%, which is a change of 5.2% from F0.

So the amplitude of the variation is 5.2% of F0.

So the planet's dip must be 5.2%, leading to Rpl/Rstar ≈0.228.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spots cause more of a variation because the flux change is per unit area, but I'm not considering that.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the ratio differently, taking into account that the spots are cooler and thus their contribution to the flux is less.

But I think I did that correctly.

Wait, is there another approach? Perhaps using the concept of the brightness variation due to the planet and the spot.

The planet's brightness variation is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

The spot's variation is the difference in flux due to the spots. So perhaps the amplitude is (F_spot - F_unspot) * (area fraction), but that's what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think that the correct answer is 0.227, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the radius of a planet to produce the same maximum brightness variation as the star's spots, which would be the same as the dip.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.0517) ≈0.227.

But the options don't have that, so perhaps I need to reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I should use an approximate method.

Compute (5000/6000)^4: (5/6)^4 = 625/1296 ≈0.482.

So the flux per spot is 0.482 times the flux of the surrounding area.

The area of the spots is 20% of a hemisphere, which is 0.2 * (π Rstar²) because a hemisphere's area is 2π R², and 20% is 0.2 *2π R²=0.4 π R².

So the total flux from the spots when they're visible is 0.4 π R² * 0.482 * F0/(4 π R²).

Because F0 is 4 π R² * σ (6000)^4. So each unit area contributes σ (6000)^4, but the spots contribute 0.482 * that.

So the total flux from spots is 0.4 π R² * 0.482 * (σ 6000^4 )

The total flux is F0 =4 π R² σ 6000^4.

So the flux from spots is (0.4 π R² *0.482 ) / (4 π R²) ) * F0.

= (0.4 *0.482 ) /4 * F0.

= (0.1928) /4 * F0.

= 0.0482 F0.

So the flux when the spots are visible is F0 - 0.0482 F0 + 0.0482 F0 * (5000/6000)^4 ?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Wait, the flux from the spots is 0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4.

The total flux without spots is F0 =4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

So the flux when spots are visible is F_spotted = (4 π R² - 0.4 π R²) σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

= 3.6 π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

= π R² σ [3.6 *6000^4 + 0.4*5000^4 ].

Divide by F0 =4 π R² σ 6000^4.

So F_spotted/F0 = [3.6*6000^4 + 0.4*5000^4 ] / [4 *6000^4 ].

= [3.6 + 0.4*(5000/6000)^4 ] /4.

= [3.6 + 0.4*(0.482253)] /4.

= [3.6 + 0.1929] /4.

= 3.7929 /4 ≈0.9482.

So the dip is 1 -0.9482 =0.0518, or 5.18% of F0.

So again, the same result.

Thus, the planet's dip must be 5.18%, leading to Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈0.227.

But none of the options are close to this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem understanding. The question states that the star's hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2π Rstar²), which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's rotational period causes the spots to appear and disappear, leading to a sinusoidal variation, and the amplitude is half the maximum dip.

So maximum dip is 5.18%, so amplitude is 2.59%.

So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 =0.0259 → Rpl/Rstar ≈0.1609.

Which is about 0.16, which is closest to option C) 0.11, but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the equivalent planet radius for the same brightness variation, considering the light curve's shape.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the depth of the dip being the same, not the amplitude. Which is what I've been calculating.

But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the temperature ratio.

Wait, 5000/6000 is 5/6. (5/6)^4 is 625/1296 ≈0.482.

But perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

5^4=625,6^4=1296.

625/1296 = approx 0.482253.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck here. Given the options, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the area of the spots.

Wait, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, not just one hemisphere.

Wait, the problem says: "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%". So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere.

So the area is 0.2 * (2π R^2) =0.4 π R², which is correct.

But perhaps the problem considers the entire star, so the filling factor is 10% (since one hemisphere is 20% filled, so 20% of 50% of the surface area). So the area would be 0.2 * (2π R²) =0.4 π R².

No, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's light curve variation isn't just a single dip but varies as the spots rotate, leading to a certain effective amplitude.

But I can't think of a way to model this correctly without more information.

Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.11, but I don't understand why.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the correct approach is to compute the flux change as 5.17%, leading to Rpl/Rstar ≈0.227, but since that's not an option, perhaps I should look for the closest option, which would be D) 0.32.

But 0.32^2 is 0.1024, which is about 10% dip, which is larger than our calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation, and the correct answer is option C) ~0.11.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the problem differently.

The star's brightness variation due to the spots is similar to that of a planet transit. The planet's signal is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

The star's signal is the difference in flux due to the spots, which is (A_spots/Rstar^2) * (T_spot^4 - T_star^4 ) / T_star^4.

So the amplitude is (A_spots/Rstar^2) * (T_spot^4 - T_star^4 ) / T_star^4.

Set this equal to (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So:

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = (A_spots/Rstar^2) * (T_spot^4 - T_star^4 ) / T_star^4.

= [ (0.4 π Rstar^2) / Rstar^2 ] * (5000^4 -6000^4 ) / (6000^4 )

= 0.4 π * ( -6000^4 +5000^4 ) /6000^4.

Wait, but (5000^4 -6000^4 ) is negative, so the amplitude would be positive.

But let me compute:

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = [0.4 π ] * (5000^4 -6000^4 ) / (6000^4 )

= 0.4 π * ( (5000/6000)^4 -1 )

= 0.4 π * ( (5/6)^4 -1 )

=0.4 π * (0.482253 -1 )

=0.4 π * (-0.517747 )

= -0.2071 π.

Wait, this gives a negative value, which doesn't make sense.

I think I'm getting stuck here and perhaps need to approach this differently. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C) ~0.11, as it's the only one that's somewhat close when considering possible miscalculations.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the variation caused by the spots as a periodic function, and the amplitude is computed as the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness divided by twice the mean.

Wait, if the star's brightness varies sinusoidally, the amplitude would be (F_max - F_min)/2.

In that case, the maximum brightness is F0 (no spots), and the minimum is F_spotted.

So (F0 - F_spotted)/2 is the amplitude.

So the amplitude is 5.17% /2 = 2.585%.

So the planet's dip should be 2.585% of F0, leading to (Rpl/Rstar)^2 =0.02585 → Rpl/Rstar≈0.1608.

Which is close to option C) ~0.11 (0.11^2=0.0121 → 1.21% dip).

No, it's not close enough.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star's rotation causes the spots to appear and disappear over the entire surface, leading to a certain effective area.

Wait, perhaps the effective area is the sum of the spots on both hemispheres, but the problem states that only one hemisphere is spotty.

Wait, perhaps the star's brightness variation is due to the spots on one hemisphere, but as the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view, leading to a sinusoidal brightness variation with an amplitude of (A_spots/Rstar²) * (T_spot^4 - T_star^4 ) / T_star^4.

But I'm not sure.

After a lot of thinking and trying different approaches, I think I've made a mistake in the initial calculation, but I can't see where. The options don't include the correct value, but perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.11, but I'm not certain.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in a star's light curve as the brightness variation caused by dark spots on the star. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, an effective temperature of 6000 K, and one hemisphere covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. The spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K (5000 K). The goal is to find the ratio \( R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}} \) such that the planet's transit causes the same amplitude in brightness variation as the spots.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Star's Total Flux Without Spots**:
   The total flux of the star without spots is given by:
   \[
   F_0 = 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4
   \]
   where \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Flux When Spots Are Visible**:
   The area of the spots is \( 0.2 \times \text{hemisphere area} = 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \). The flux when the spots are fully visible is:
   \[
   F_{\text{spotted}} = (4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 - 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2) \sigma (6000)^4 + 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (5000)^4
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   F_{\text{spotted}} = \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \left[ 3.6 \times (6000)^4 + 0.4 \times (5000)^4 \right]
   \]

3. **Brightness Variation**:
   The dip in brightness when the spots are visible is:
   \[
   \Delta F = F_0 - F_{\text{spotted}}
   \]
   Substituting:
   \[
   \Delta F = 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4 - \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \left[ 3.6 \times (6000)^4 + 0.4 \times (5000)^4 \right]
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \Delta F = \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \left[ 0.4 \times (6000)^4 - 0.4 \times (5000)^4 \right]
   \]
   The relative dip is:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{0.4 \times (6000^4 - 5000^4)}{4 \times 6000^4}
   \]
   Calculating \( 6000^4 = 1.296 \times 10^{15} \) and \( 5000^4 = 6.25 \times 10^{14} \):
   \[
   6000^4 - 5000^4 = 6.71 \times 10^{14}
   \]
   Substituting:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{0.4 \times 6.71 \times 10^{14}}{4 \times 1.296 \times 10^{15}} = \frac{2.684 \times 10^{14}}{5.184 \times 10^{15}} \approx 0.0517 \, \text{(or 5.17%)}.
   \]

4. **Planet's Brightness Variation**:
   The dip caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to \( (R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}})^2 \). Setting this equal to the dip caused by the spots:
   \[
   (R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}})^2 = 0.0517
   \]
   Solving for \( R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}} \):
   \[
   R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}} = \sqrt{0.0517} \approx 0.227
   \]

5. **Comparison with Options**:
   The calculated value \( R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}} \approx 0.227 \) does not match any of the provided options. The closest option is **D) ~0.32**, but this corresponds to a dip of approximately 10.24%, which is larger than the calculated 5.17%. None of the other options are close to the calculated value.

### Conclusion:
The problem likely involves an inconsistency between the calculated value and the provided options. Based on the calculations, the correct value is approximately \( 0.227 \), but since this is not an option, the closest match is **D) ~0.32**.

Answer: D
