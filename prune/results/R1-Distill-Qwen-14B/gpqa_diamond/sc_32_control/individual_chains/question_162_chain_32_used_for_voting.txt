Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about the area of a pseudosphere using the given metric. Hmm, I remember that the area of a surface in general relativity is calculated using the metric tensor. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). I think this is in 2D because there's only dx and dy. But wait, pseudosphere—oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. The metric might be that of a hyperbolic space.

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, wait, pseudospheres in 2D would be like hyperbolic planes, right? But wait, this metric might be representing a hyperbolic plane.

Wait, no, I'm not sure. Let me think about the form of the metric. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). That looks a bit like the metric for a sphere, but with a different sign maybe? Wait, the standard metric for a sphere in isometric coordinates is something like (R²)/(R² - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²), but this is 2D so perhaps similar.

Wait, wait, the given metric is for a 2D space. So the line element ds² is given in terms of x and y. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which suggests that the radius is sqrt(4) = 2. So the radius r is 2, which matches the question. Oh wait, the question says pseudosphere of radius 2, so this is the metric for a pseudosphere with r=2.

Now, the area of a pseudosphere. Wait, in 2D, a pseudosphere is a hyperbolic plane. But wait, the hyperbolic plane is non-compact, which means its area is infinite. But wait, pseudospheres in some contexts are considered as compact surfaces. Or maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, in 3D, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, but it's compact. However, in 2D, the hyperbolic plane is non-compact and has infinite area. So if this metric is for a hyperbolic plane, then the area would be infinite. Or is this a different case?

Wait, the metric given is for a 2D surface. Let's write it in a more standard form. Let me see: ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me think about the curvature here. Hmm, I think the Gaussian curvature K for a metric of the form E(dx² + dy²) where E = e^{2λ} would be -λ''. Wait, but perhaps it's easier to note that for a metric like ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²)/(a² - r²), which is a hyperbolic metric, where a is the radius. So in that case, the Gaussian curvature K would be -1/a². So if a=2, K is -1/4.

But that's for the hyperbolic plane. Now, what is the area of the hyperbolic plane? Well, in the hyperbolic plane, the area is infinite because it's non-compact. But wait, the metric here is defined only for regions where 4 - x² - y² is positive, so x² + y² <4. Wait, no, if the denominator is 4 - x² - y², then the region is where x² + y² <4, so it's a disk of radius 2. But wait, that's a sphere. Oh wait, but wait, for a hyperbolic metric, the denominator is (a² - r²), where r is the radial coordinate. So if the metric is written in terms of x and y, perhaps it's a bounded region.

Wait, maybe this is a model of hyperbolic space in the Poincaré disk model. The Poincaré disk model has metric ds² = [4/(1 - r²)^2] (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate (r <1). So in that case, the metric is defined on a disk of radius 1, and the area of the hyperbolic plane (in the Poincaré model) is finite when you integrate over the disk, but wait, no, it's still infinite because the hyperbolic plane is infinite in extent, but the model is a finite disk. Wait, no, the model is just a representation; the actual hyperbolic plane is unbounded, so its area is infinite.

But in this case, the denominator is 4 - x² - y². Let me think about the area element. The area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since it's diagonal, the determinant is just (32/(4 - x² - y²)) * (32/(4 -x² -y²)) ? No, wait no. The metric is (32/(4−x²−y²)) (dx² + dy²). So it can be written as diag(32/(4−r²), 32/(4−r²)), where r² =x² + y². The determinant of the metric tensor g is the product of the coefficients of dx² and dy², since it's diagonal. So g = (32/(4−r²))^2. So the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, but actually, since it's a 2D metric, the area element is (32/(4−r²)) dr dθ, after switching to polar coordinates.

Wait, to compute the area, I need to integrate the area element over the entire space where the metric is defined. But the metric is only defined where 4 - x² - y² >0, so x² + y² <4, which is a disk of radius 2. So perhaps this is a compact space. Wait, but hyperbolic space isn't compact, but if this is a model of a compact space, perhaps it's a sphere? No, because earlier I thought the metric is for hyperbolic space.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh wait, maybe it's a 2D pseudosphere, which would be a hyperbolic sphere, a compact surface. Wait, but I'm getting confused between 2D and 3D here. In 3D, a pseudosphere has finite area. But this question is about 2D.

Wait, the question says 'pseudosphere' which usually refers to a 3D surface, like the tractricoid, which is a surface of constant negative curvature. But the given metric is 2D. Hmm. So perhaps the question is actually about a 2D pseudosphere, which might be a hyperbolic sphere, but I'm not too sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is for a 2D surface that's a sphere with positive curvature, but that's not a pseudosphere. Wait, no, pseudosphere refers to negative curvature.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because the metric is given in terms of x and y, which makes it 2D. So perhaps the question is about a 2D pseudosphere, which is a hyperbolic plane, which is non-compact and has infinite area.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is for a compact surface. Let me compute the area. The area would be the integral of the area element over the region where the metric is defined.

So first, let me rewrite the metric in polar coordinates. Let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². So the metric becomes:

ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²)

So the area element is sqrt(g) dr dθ. But since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is [32/(4−r²)]^2. So sqrt(g) is 32/(4−r²). Therefore, the area element is (32/(4−r²)) dr dθ.

Wait, no, wait. The metric is for 2D, so g_{rr} = 32/(4−r²), and g_{θθ} = (32 r²)/(4−r²). So the determinant is g_rr * g_θθ = [32/(4−r²)] * [32 r²/(4−r²)] = (32)^2 r²/(4−r²)^2.

So the square root of the determinant is sqrt(g) = (32 r)/(4−r²). So the area element is sqrt(g) dr dθ = [32 r/(4−r²)] dr dθ.

Wait, no, because the determinant is (32/(4−r²))^2 * r², because the metric tensor in 2D is:

g = [[32/(4−r²), 0],
     [0, (32 r²)/(4−r²)]]

So determinant is (32/(4−r²)) * (32 r²/(4−r²)) )= (32^2 r²)/(4−r²)^2.

So sqrt(g) is (32 r)/(4−r²).

So the area element is (32 r)/(4−r²) dr dθ.

Now, to find the total area, integrate this over the valid region of r.

The metric is valid where 4 - r² >0 → r² <4 → r <2. So integrating from r=0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π.

So the area A is ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 − r²)] dr dθ.

Let me compute the integral ∫ [32 r/(4−r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution: Let u = 4−r² → du = -2r dr → -du/2 = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32/(u)] * (r dr) → 32 ∫ [1/u] * (-du/2) → -16 ∫ (1/u) du.

But the limits are from u=4 to u=0. So,

-16 ∫ (from4 to 0) (1/u) du = -16 [ln(u) from4 to0 ].

Wait, integrating 1/u from 4 to0 is ln(0) - ln(4). But ln(0) is negative infinity, so this integral diverges to negative infinity? Wait, but we have a negative sign. So:

-16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] = -16 [ (-∞) - ln(4) ] → -16 (-∞) = +∞.

Wait, so the integral for r from 0 to 2 is divergent. That suggests the area is infinite.

But wait, the denominator in the area element is (4−r²), which goes to zero as r approaches 2. So the integrand near r=2 behaves like (32 r)/(4−r²), which as r approaches 2, becomes (32 *2)/(4−4) → (64)/0 → infinity. So near r=2, the integrand diverges, making the integral diverge to infinity.

So the total area is infinite. So the correct answer would be option D) +infty.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 0

B) 4π(x² + y²)

C) 4π(x² - y²)

D) +infty

So the correct answer is D.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D surface. To determine the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\), we first recognize that this metric corresponds to a hyperbolic plane in the Poincaré disk model, where the region of definition is \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), or equivalently \(r < 2\) in polar coordinates. 

The area element for this metric is derived as follows. In polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), where \(x = r \cos\theta\) and \(y = r \sin\theta\), the metric becomes:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

The determinant of the metric tensor is:

\[
g = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2} = \frac{(32)^2 r^2}{(4 - r^2)^2}.
\]

The square root of the determinant is:

\[
\sqrt{g} = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2}.
\]

Thus, the area element is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{g} \, dr \, d\theta = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

To compute the total area, we integrate this area element over the entire region where the metric is defined, i.e., \(r \in [0, 2)\) and \(\theta \in [0, 2\pi)\):

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, perform the radial integration:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the limits of integration change from \(r = 0\) (\(u = 4\)) to \(r = 2\) (\(u = 0\)). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_4^0 \frac{32}{u} \cdot \left(-\frac{du}{2}\right) = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \left[\ln(u)\right]_4^0.
\]

As \(u \to 0\), \(\ln(u) \to -\infty\), so the integral diverges to \(+\infty\). This indicates that the total area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is clearly not zero.
- **B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this does not represent the area of the pseudosphere.
- **C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this is not a valid expression for the area.
- **D) \(+\infty\)**: Correct, as shown by the divergence of the integral.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.
