Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in the qubits space. The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). The options are four points in a 3D space, labeled A to D.

Hmm, I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (a statistical mixture of pure states) rather than pure. In this case, ρ is given, so I need to figure out where it would sit in the Bloch sphere representation.

Wait, the Bloch sphere... Right, any single-qubit state can be represented on a Bloch sphere. For a pure state |ψ>, the density matrix is |ψ><ψ|, and its Bloch vector is (x, y, z), where x = <σx>, y = <σy>, z = <σz>, with σ being the Pauli matrices.

But when the state is mixed, like this ρ, it's a mixed state. So how do I find the Bloch vector for a mixed state? I think it's the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. So maybe I can calculate <σx>, <σy>, and <σz> for this ρ.

Let me write out the given ρ. ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). That looks familiar. I think this is the completely mixed state for a single qubit. Because each of the orthogonal states |0> and |1> are equally weighted, so it's like an equal mixture of both.

Wait, |0><0| is the density matrix for the state |0>, and same for |1>. So when you take the average with equal weights (1/2 each), you get this mixed state. So what's the Bloch vector for this?

I remember that for the completely mixed state, the Bloch vector is at the origin. Because the mixed state has zero coherence and equal probabilities for |0> and |1>. So the expectation values for σx, σy, σz would all be zero.

Let me double-check. The density matrix ρ can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector (x, y, z), and I is the identity matrix. So if I compare that to our given ρ, which is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, that's the same as (I)/2 because |0><0| + |1><1| = I for a single qubit.

So ρ = (I)/2. Comparing to (I + r·σ)/2, that would mean r·σ = 0. Which implies r is the zero vector. So the Bloch vector is (0,0,0), which is the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the correct answer must be C.

Wait, just to be thorough, let me compute the expectation values. The expectation of σx is Tr(ρ σx). Let's compute that.

σx is the Pauli X matrix:
[ [0,1],
  [1,0] ]

|0><0| is:
[ [1,0],
  [0,0] ]

|1><1| is:
[ [0,0],
  [0,1] ]

So ρ is (1/2)( [ [1,0], [0,0] ] + [ [0,0], [0,1] ] ) = (1/2) [ [1,0], [0,1] ] = I/2.

So ρ is I/2. Now, Tr(ρ σx) = Tr( (I/2) σx ) = (1/2) Tr( σx )? Wait, Tr(σx) is zero because the diagonal elements are 0 and 0. So Tr(σx) is 0. So (1/2)*0=0.

Same for σy: Tr(ρ σy) = (1/2) Tr(σy) = 0. And for σz: Tr(ρ σz) = (1/2) Tr(σz). What's Tr(σz)? The diagonal elements are 1 and -1, so trace is 0. So all three expectation values are zero. So r is (0,0,0), which is option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1|\right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, specifically the completely mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the position of a quantum state is determined by its Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (x, y, z) \), where \( x = \langle \sigma_x \rangle \), \( y = \langle \sigma_y \rangle \), and \( z = \langle \sigma_z \rangle \). For the completely mixed state, the coherence vanishes, and the equal probabilities for \( |0\rangle \) and \( |1\rangle \) result in zero expectation values for all Pauli matrices \( \sigma_x \), \( \sigma_y \), and \( \sigma_z \). Thus, the Bloch vector is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), corresponding to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

To confirm, the given density matrix can be rewritten as \( \rho = \frac{I}{2} \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix. Comparing this to the general form \( \rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2} \), it is clear that \( \mathbf{r} = 0 \). Additionally, calculating the expectation values \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \), \( \langle \sigma_y \rangle \), and \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \) for \( \rho \) yields zero in all cases, confirming that the Bloch vector is at the origin.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \).
