Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution. They give me the concentrations of Co and SCN-, and some stability constants for the complexes. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all the cobalt species. 

Wait, stability constants... right, those are formation constants, right? So β values indicate how stable the complexes are. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. The question is about the percentage of a specific complex— the blue dithiocyanato, which I think is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ or maybe a different one. Let me think.

The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, the order is β1 to β4, so each corresponds to the complex with 1, 2, 3, 4 SCN- ligands. So [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, [Co(SCN)_3]^3-, and [Co(SCN)_4]^4-? Or maybe it's a different charge. Well, I'll keep that in mind.

The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- is 0.1 M. So the initial concentrations are [Co^2+] = 0.01 M, and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

I think the approach is to calculate the distribution of Co species based on the stability constants. The stability constants determine the proportion of each complex formed.

The problem is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I believe is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex. Wait, but wait— sometimes the colors change with different ligand numbers. But the question says "blue dithiocyanato," which would be two SCN ligands. So that's the second complex, with β2=40.

To find the percentage, I need to compute the fraction of each complex relative to all the possible cobalt species. The total cobalt is the sum of all the Co species: Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, [Co(SCN)_3]^3-, [Co(SCN)_4]^4-.

But wait, another thought: the formation of these complexes depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of Co and SCN. So maybe it's a matter of using the formation constants to find the fraction of each species.

I remember that the fraction of each species can be found using the log of the β and the concentrations. But how exactly?

I think the general approach is to use the equilibrium expressions for each complex. For each complex, [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) = β_n * [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

But since all the species are in equilibrium, perhaps I can normalize the concentrations relative to the free Co^2+.

Wait, maybe I should model this using the concept of log K and the distribution of species. Alternatively, I can model it as a competition between the different complexes.

Wait, another approach: The fraction of each complex is given by the term (β_n [SCN]^n ) / (1 + sum over all m of (β_m [SCN]^m) )

But wait, wait. Let me think again. The total concentration of Co is the sum of all the species. Each species [Co(SCN)_n] has a concentration equal to β_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

Wait, but [Co^2+] is in all terms, so perhaps it's better to express all concentrations in terms of [Co^2+] and then find the ratio.

Alternatively, we can let [Co^2+] = x. Then, the concentration of each complex is given by β_n * x * (SCN^-)^n.

But wait, the total cobalt is the sum of all these, plus x. Because [Co^2+] is x, and each complex contributes to the total.

So,

Total Co = x + β1 x [SCN] + β2 x [SCN]^2 + β3 x [SCN]^3 + β4 x [SCN]^4

But wait, no. Because each complex is [Co(SCN)_n], so the concentration is [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

So, the total Co is:

[Co]_total = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ + [Co(SCN)_3]^3- + [Co(SCN)_4]^4-

Which can be written as:

[Co]_total = x + β1 x [SCN]^1 + β2 x [SCN]^2 + β3 x [SCN]^3 + β4 x [SCN]^4.

Wait, but [Co]_total is given as 0.01 M. So,

x (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 ) = [Co]_total.

But wait, [SCN] is 0.1 M. So,

x (1 + β1*(0.1) + β2*(0.1)^2 + β3*(0.1)^3 + β4*(0.1)^4 ) = 0.01.

Once x is found, [Co]_total is accounted for. Then, the fraction of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n]/[Co]_total.

So the steps are:

1. Calculate each term in the denominator: compute βn [SCN]^n for each n.

2. Sum all (βn [SCN]^n) plus 1 (for the free Co^2+).

3. The denominator is the sum, and the total is 0.01 M.

Wait, let's compute each term.

Given:

β1 =9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

[SCN] = 0.1.

Compute each βn [SCN]^n:

n=1: 9 * (0.1) = 0.9

n=2:40 * (0.1)^2 =40 *0.01=0.4

n=3:63 * (0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063

n=4:16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016

Now sum all these terms plus 1:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

+0.4 → 2.3

+0.063 → 2.363

+0.0016 →2.3646

So denominator is 2.3646.

So,

x = [Co^2+] = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004223 M.

Now, the concentration of the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is β2 x [SCN]^2.

Which is 40 * 0.004223 * (0.1)^2.

Wait, wait, no: [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2.

So, [Co(SCN)_2] = 40 * x * (0.1)^2.

But x is 0.004223.

So,

40 * 0.004223 * 0.01 =40 * 0.004223 *0.01.

Calculating that:

40 * 0.004223 = 0.16892

Then multiplied by 0.01: 0.0016892 M.

The total [Co]_total is 0.01 M, so the fraction is 0.0016892 / 0.01 = 0.16892, or 16.892%.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Wait, the options are A) 42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

So 16.892% is approximately 16.9%, which is option D. But wait, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, if that's [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, then yes.

Wait, but wait a second. I just assumed that the fraction is [Co(SCN)_2]/[Co]_total. But wait, the problem says the "percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes", which may refer to any complexes with two SCN- ligands. But in this case, the only one is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

So yes, the answer would be approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Let's compute each term again.

Compute each βn [SCN]^n:

n=1: 9 * 0.1 =0.9 → correct.

n=2:40 * (0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4 → correct.

n=3:63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063 → correct.

n=4:16*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016 → correct.

Sum is 1 +0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016= 2.3646 → correct.

x = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004223 M.

[Co(SCN)_2] = 40 * x * (0.1)^2 =40 * 0.004223 *0.01 =40 *0.00004223=0.0016892 M.

Fraction is 0.0016892 / 0.01 = 0.16892 → 16.892% → rounds to 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the options have C) 38.1% and that's higher than this. Did I make a mistake in the approach?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the stability constants are given as log β or β. Wait, the question states "stability constants" so I think they're given as β, not log β. So probably correct.

Another thought: maybe the complex [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is actually the major blue complex, but perhaps [Co(SCN)_3]^3- is another. Do I have the right formula for each complex?

Wait, for Co(II), each SCN- is a monodentate ligand. So the charge of the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n), because Co is +2, each SCN is -1. So for n ligands, the charge is 2 -n.

So for n=2, complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0? No, wait no: Co^2+ with two SCN^- gives (2+) + 2*(-1) = 0. So the complex is neutral. So [Co(SCN)_2] would have a charge of 0.

Wait, but then, how does that affect the calculation? Hmm, but in this case, the calculation would still proceed the same way because the β is given, regardless of charge.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the stability constants are applied. Let me think again.

Stability constant (β) is defined as:

β_n = [Co(SCN)_n]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n)

So yes, the formula is correct.

So [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

Therefore, the calculation of [Co(SCN)_2] is 40 * x * (0.1)^2.

Which, as before, is correct.

So, what's the percentage? Approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the options have another option, C)38.1%, which is close to 0.381. Could I have missed something?

Wait, perhaps the question is about the dithiocyanato complexes, which might be a different complex. Wait, the term "dithiocyanato" refers to two SCN ligands, so [Co(SCN)_2]^0. But perhaps the complex with two SCN ligands is a different one. Alternatively, perhaps the dithiocyanato refers to two S atoms, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, maybe I miscounted the number of ligands. Let me think again about the complexes and their β values.

Wait, the problem states that β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So:

n=1 → β1=9 → [CoSCN]^+.

n=2 → β2=40 → [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

n=3 → β3=63 → [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

n=4 → β4=16 → [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

So the calculation for the [Co(SCN)_2] is indeed correct. So the fraction is 16.9%, option D.

But why is there an option C, 38.1%? Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the sum.

Let me recompute the denominator:

Sum = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016.

1 + 0.9 =1.9

+0.4 →2.3

+0.063 → 2.363

+0.0016 →2.3646 → correct.

So x is 0.01 /2.3646 ≈0.004223 M.

Compute [Co(SCN)_2] = 40 * x * (0.1)^2.

x=0.004223, 0.1^2=0.01.

40 * 0.004223=0.16892.

0.16892 * 0.01=0.0016892.

So [Co(SCN)_2] = 0.0016892 M.

Total [Co] is 0.01 M.

So fraction is 0.0016892 / 0.01 = 0.16892 → 16.892%, which rounds to 16.9%, option D.

Hmm, but another approach: perhaps the log of the stability constant is used, but the problem says the stability constants are given as β. So I think my initial approach is correct.

Wait, another idea: maybe the expression for the fraction is (β_n [SCN]^n) / sum(β_m [SCN]^m) for all m. But wait, that would be the ratio without considering the free Co^2+.

Wait, the fraction of [Co(SCN)_n] is [Co(SCN)_n] / [Co]_total.

Which is [ β_n x [SCN]^n ] / (x (sum β_m [SCN]^m +1 )) )

Wait, because [Co]_total = x * (sum β_m [SCN]^m +1 ), as per the earlier equation.

So, [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n x [SCN]^n.

So fraction = (β_n [SCN]^n) / ( sum_{m} β_m [SCN]^m + 1 )

Wait, that's another way to compute it.

So, the denominator is sum(β_m [SCN]^m) +1.

Wait, let's compute that.

sum(β_m [SCN]^m) =0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016=1.3646.

So denominator is 1.3646 +1=2.3646.

So, for [Co(SCN)_2], the fraction is (0.4)/2.3646.

0.4 /2.3646 = approximately 0.1689, which is 16.89% → 16.9% again.

Same answer as before. So, that's correct.

Wait, but why is option C 38.1%? Maybe I computed the wrong complex. Oh wait, perhaps the question is about the major blue complex, which is [Co(SCN)_3]^3-? Or perhaps I got the wrong n for the blue complex.

Wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato means two ligands. So that's n=2, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So the same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the dithiocyanato complex is a different species, perhaps a different charge. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the formation of only some complexes, but I think I followed the correct approach.

So, based on the calculations, I think the correct answer is D, 16.9%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]) among all cobalt-containing species, we use the stability constants and concentrations provided. The stability constants are given as β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16, and the concentrations are [Co²⁺] = 10⁻² M and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.

### Step 1: Calculate the contributions of each complex
The fraction of each cobalt species is determined by the equilibrium expressions for the complexes:
\[
\text{Fraction of } [\text{Co(SCN)}_n] = \frac{\beta_n [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{1 + \sum_{m=1}^4 \beta_m [\text{SCN}^-]^m}
\]

First, compute the contributions of each complex:
- For \( n = 1 \): \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
- For \( n = 2 \): \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \)
- For \( n = 3 \): \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \)
- For \( n = 4 \): \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \)

The total contribution from all complexes is:
\[
\text{Sum of contributions} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the fraction of the blue dithiocyanato complex
The blue dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2], which corresponds to \( n = 2 \). Its fraction is:
\[
\text{Fraction of } [\text{Co(SCN)}_2] = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\text{Sum of contributions}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646}
\]

Performing the division:
\[
\text{Fraction of } [\text{Co(SCN)}_2] = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.1689 \, \text{(or 16.89%)}
\]

### Step 3: Interpret the result
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is approximately 16.9%, which matches option D.

ANSWER: D
