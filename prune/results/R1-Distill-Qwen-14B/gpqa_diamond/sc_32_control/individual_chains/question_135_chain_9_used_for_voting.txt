Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's see what I can remember from my studies. The question is about the allowed decay channels of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. 

The problem gives a Lagrangian term: L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused about what this term represents. Oh right, the Lagrangian describes the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions. So X is interacting with fermions, and the decay products would be fermionic pairs.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So when X decays, it has to produce particles whose combined mass is less than 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, the rest mass of the parent must be at least the sum of the rest masses of the decay products for the decay to be kinematically allowed.

Wait, but I should also consider whether the fermions can be produced in pairs. Oh right, because bosons can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. So the question is, which fermions have a combined mass less than 6 GeV?

Let me list all the known fermions and their masses. The fermions are quarks of various flavors and leptons. But wait, the quark masses are a bit tricky because they're usually given as current masses, but in particle decays, especially at the tree level, the constituent mass (or perhaps the mass of the hadrons they form) matters more? Hmm, no, wait. In this case, since X is a boson decaying into quark-antiquark pairs, the energy required is the sum of the masses of the quarks. But wait, actually, the rest mass of the quarks is quite small for some of them, but when considering decay into quarks, the process is more about whether the energy is sufficient. But maybe the quark masses are negligible compared to the boson mass, but wait, no, because for some quarks, their masses are significant.

Wait, let me get the masses right. The light quarks (u, d, s) have masses around a few MeV. The c quark is about 1.3 GeV, the b quark about 4.7 GeV, the top quark is around 173 GeV, and the tau lepton is about 1.78 GeV. The charged leptons, like electrons, muons, taus, have masses 0.511 MeV, 105.7 MeV, and 1.78 GeV respectively. Neutrinos are negligible, but in the decay process, perhaps they're not considered here because the Lagrangian term involves ψ_f, which are fermions, but since the decay is X → f fbar, f must be a Dirac or Majorana fermion. But for the purpose of allowed decays, I can think of all the fermions with their rest masses.

So X has a mass of 6 GeV. For X to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the sum of their rest masses must be less than 6 GeV.

Let me list the possible fermions and their masses:

- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos (ν_e, ν_μ, ν_τ): negligible, but if they're Dirac, their masses are tiny, but I think in this problem, we can ignore them because the rest mass is so small. But wait, the question's options don't have neutrinos as decay products, so perhaps only charged leptons and quarks are considered.

For quarks:

- Up (u): ~2.2 MeV
- Down (d): ~4.7 MeV
- Strange (s): ~95 MeV
- Charm (c): ~1.3 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.7 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV (way too heavy, so X cannot decay into top-antitop, since 2*173 GeV is way larger than 6 GeV)

So, let's calculate the sum of the rest masses for each possible pair.

First, considering quarks:

- u and anti-u: 2.2 MeV *2 = ~4.4 MeV. That's way less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into uū.

- d and anti-d: 4.7 MeV *2 = ~9.4 MeV. Also allowed.

- s and anti-s: 95 MeV *2 = 190 MeV. Less than 6 GeV.

- c and anti-c: 1.3 GeV *2 = 2.6 GeV. Less than 6 GeV.

- b and anti-b: 4.7 GeV *2 = 9.4 GeV. Oh wait, 9.4 GeV is more than 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b bbar because that would require X's mass to be at least 9.4 GeV. Since X is 6 GeV, that's not allowed.

So for quarks, possible decay products are uū, ddbar, s sbar, c cbar.

Now charged leptons:

Electron pair: 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. Allowed.

Muon pair: 2 * 105.7 MeV = 211.4 MeV. Allowed.

Tau pair: 2 * 1.78 GeV = 3.56 GeV. Which is less than 6 GeV. So tau pair is allowed.

What about the neutrinos? Well, their rest mass is negligible, but since they are neutral, perhaps the decay X → ννbar is possible. But wait, the boson is neutral? The problem states that X is a boson, but whether it's charged depends on the interaction. Wait, looking back at the Lagrangian: the term is -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps I should think about the charge. The term ψ_f is a fermion field, so the interaction must conserve charge. So X must have a charge that allows the interaction.

Wait, maybe the exact charge isn't given, but looking at the structure, the interaction is ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that doesn't quite make sense dimensionally. Oh wait, the term should be something like ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y), which would be a Yukawa-like coupling. Wait, perhaps it's a Yukawa interaction where X is a scalar boson. In that case, X would be neutral because Yukawa couplings typically involve neutral bosons mediating interactions between fermions. So X is neutral. Therefore, the decay products must be a fermion-antifermion pair with the same charge. But since X is neutral, the decay products must also be neutral. So for leptons, only the charged ones would produce charged pairs, but that would require X to be neutral.

Wait, no. For example, if X is a neutral boson, it can decay into a charged lepton and its antiparticle. Because the sum would be neutral: e+ and e- would sum to charge 0. Similarly for mu+ and mu-. For tau+, tau-.

So the allowed leptonic decays would be e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-.

Wait, but do tau leptons have enough mass? As I thought earlier, 2 * 1.78 GeV is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So allowed.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

But wait, earlier I thought that b bbar would need 9.4 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar. So option A is incorrect because it includes b bbar.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, c cbar: 2.6 GeV, which is allowed. So this option includes c cbar. Hmm.

But in my earlier analysis, X could decay into c cbar. So which is correct?

Wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. Let me double-check the possible fermions:

Charm quark: mass ~1.3 GeV. So c and cbar would sum to 2.6 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into c cbar.

So the allowed quark decays are u u, d d, s s, c c.

Leptons: e, mu, tau.

So the decay products should include c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, but what about the bottom quark? As in, in option B, bottom isn't in the decay. Option D includes b bbar, but that's not allowed.

So the correct decay channels would include the c cbar, which means option B or D. Wait, looking again at the options:

Option B includes c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau, mu, e.

Option D includes b bbar, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

So from my analysis, since c cbar is allowed (2.6 GeV), but b bbar is not (9.4 GeV), the correct option should include c cbar but not b bbar.

So looking at the options, option B includes c cbar, and no b bbar. So option B would be correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. The Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λf f(y)(v + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps I should consider which fermions f are present. The term seems to be f and psi_f; perhaps it's a Yukawa coupling between X and fermions f. So which fermions f can X couple to? Because the problem states that the interaction is with fermions, but perhaps X has a coupling to all possible fermions, but only those with mass less than 6 GeV can be decay products.

So the possible decay products are any fermion-antifermion pair where 2m_f < 6 GeV.

So for quarks:

u: m=2.2 MeV → 2m=4.4 MeV: allowed.

d: 4.7 MeV → 9.4 MeV: allowed.

s: 95 MeV → 190 MeV: allowed.

c: 1.3 GeV → 2.6 GeV: allowed.

b: 4.7 GeV → 9.4 GeV: not allowed.

t: too heavy.

Leptons:

e: 0.511 MeV → ~1 MeV: allowed.

mu: 105 MeV → 210 MeV: allowed.

tau: 1.78 GeV → ~3.56 GeV: allowed.

So possible decay products are all the quarks except b and t, and all the charged leptons.

So the decay channels would be:

uū, ddbar, s sbar, c cbar, e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-.

So looking back at the options:

Option B lists X → c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So that matches what I just concluded.

Wait, but what about the option D? Option D has X → b bbar, which isn't allowed. So option B is correct.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction between \( X \) and fermions is described by the given Lagrangian, and the decay products must satisfy the condition that the sum of the rest masses of the fermion-antifermion pair is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \) (6 GeV). 

### Key Analysis:
1. **Quark Decays**:
   - **Up (\( u \)) and Down (\( d \)) Quarks**: Their masses are negligible (2.2 MeV and 4.7 MeV, respectively), so \( u\bar{u} \) and \( d\bar{d} \) decays are allowed.
   - **Strange (\( s \)) Quark**: Mass is approximately 95 MeV, so \( s\bar{s} \) decay is allowed.
   - **Charm (\( c \)) Quark**: Mass is approximately 1.3 GeV, so \( c\bar{c} \) decay is allowed (total mass = 2.6 GeV).
   - **Bottom (\( b \)) Quark**: Mass is approximately 4.7 GeV, so \( b\bar{b} \) decay is not allowed (total mass = 9.4 GeV, exceeding 6 GeV).
   - **Top (\( t \)) Quark**: Mass is 173 GeV, so \( t\bar{t} \) decay is not allowed.

2. **Leptonic Decays**:
   - **Electron (\( e \))**: Mass is 0.511 MeV, so \( e^+e^- \) decay is allowed.
   - **Muon (\( \mu \))**: Mass is 105.7 MeV, so \( \mu^+\mu^- \) decay is allowed.
   - **Tau (\( \tau \))**: Mass is 1.78 GeV, so \( \tau^+\tau^- \) decay is allowed (total mass = 3.56 GeV).

3. **Neutrinos**: Their masses are negligible, and the problem does not include them as decay products, so they are ignored.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed (9.4 GeV > 6 GeV). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c\bar{c} \), \( s\bar{s} \), \( u\bar{u} \), \( d\bar{d} \), \( \tau^+\tau^- \), \( \mu^+\mu^- \), and \( e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed (173 GeV > 6 GeV). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV.
