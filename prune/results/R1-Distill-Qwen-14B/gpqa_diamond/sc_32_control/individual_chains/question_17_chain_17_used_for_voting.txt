Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a Ca-EDTA complex. The concentration of the complex is given as 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. 

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions. In this case, the complex is Ca-EDTA. The formation constant, K, tells us how strong the complex is. A higher K means the complex is more stable.

Wait, so the problem is about the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. Since the complex has a high K, it doesn't dissociate much, so the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions should be very low. 

Let me think about the formula. The formation constant K is defined as [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Right. But wait, in solution, EDTA exists in various protonated forms. Oh, but the problem says the pH is ideal, so I guess we can assume that the predominant form is the one that forms the complex, maybe the deprotonated form, EDTA^4-.

So the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. Let me denote the concentration of the complex as C_total = 0.02 M. 

When the complex dissociates, it releases Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- ions. Let's say the concentration of Ca^2+ is x. Since the complex dissociates into one Ca and one EDTA, the concentration of EDTA would also be x, assuming that the initial concentrations of Ca and EDTA are negligible compared to the complex. 

Wait, but wait. The formation of the complex is Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So the K is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-}) = 5e10.

In this case, the total concentration of EDTA is the sum of the free EDTA and the complex. But if the complex is much more stable (since K is large), the amount of free EDTA and free Ca should be very small compared to the complex. So perhaps we can approximate that [EDTA^4-] ≈ x, and [Ca^2+] ≈ x. 

So, K ≈ (C_total) / (x^2) = 5e10.

Wait, no, wait. Because the complex is 0.02 M, and when it dissociates, each mole gives one mole of Ca and one mole of EDTA. So the total EDTA is [EDTA] = x, and the complex is 0.02 - x. But if K is very large (like 5e10), that suggests that the complex is almost completely formed and there's very little dissociation. So x is much, much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. 

So K = (0.02) / (x^2) = 5e10.

Hmm, let me write that equation:

(0.02) / x² = 5e10.

Solving for x:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10 = 4e-13.

Wait wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x squared is 4e-13, so x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Let me think. Wait, sqrt(4)=2. sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6. So sqrt(4e-13)= 2 * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (1e-6.5) = 2e-6.5. Wait, but 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7. 

So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. 

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me compute 5e10 times x squared equals 0.02.

x squared is 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-3/(5e10) = (2/5)e-13 = 0.4e-13. So x is sqrt(0.4e-13) = sqrt(4e-14) no, wait. Wait, 0.4e-13 is 4e-14? No, 0.4e-13 is 4e-14. So sqrt(4e-14) is 2e-7. Wait, that would be x=2e-7. But wait, that's not matching the previous calculation. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, no, wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is 2/(5e12) = 0.4e-12. So 0.4e-12 is 4e-13. Because 0.4e-12 equals 4e-13. So x² = 4e-13. So x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, which is about 6.32e-7. So that's correct. So option C is 6.3e-7 M, which matches.

So the answer should be option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing a 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex with a formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we analyze the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant is defined as:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let the concentration of free calcium ions be \( x \). Since the complex dissociates into one Ca²⁺ and one EDTA⁴⁻ ion, the concentration of free EDTA⁴⁻ is also \( x \). The total concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 0.02 M, so:

\[
[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 - x
\]

Given that \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \) is very large, the dissociation is minimal, and \( x \) is much smaller than 0.02. Thus, we approximate \( [\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \approx \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

Simplify:

\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
