Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations given are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are β1 = 9, β2 =40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species. The options are A to D, each a percentage.

Wait, stability constants are for the formation of complexes, right? So each βn is the formation constant for the nth complex. The complexes would be [Co(SCN)]^n- where n increases as we add more SCN-.

The first complex would be Co(SCN)n^2- ... no, wait. Co(II) is +2, each SCN- is -1. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n?) Let me think. Co^2+ + SCN^- → complex. So for each n, the charge would be 2+ - n*(1−) → [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n). Wait, no, each SCN is -1, so n SCN would be -n. So Co^2+ + n SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n). For example, n=1: [Co(SCN)]^+ (since 2-1=1+), n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0, n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^−, and n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2−.

Wait, but wait, the stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So βn is the formation constant for the nth complex. So β1 is for [CoSCN], β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2], etc.

Wait, but what about the possible complexes? The problem mentions dithiocyanato, which is di meaning two SCN- ions. So the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2] or maybe another form? Wait, but the question is about dithiocyanato, which would be the n=2 complex. So we're looking for the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2] in the solution.

But wait, the stability constants are given in order β1, β2, β3, β4. So each β is the stability constant for the corresponding complex. So the most stable complex is the one with the highest β. Looking at the βs, β3 is 63 which is the highest. Then β2 is 40, β4 is 16, which is lower than β2.

Wait, but formation constants are for each successive addition. So the first complex is [CoSCN]^+, β1=9. The second is [Co(SCN)_2], β2=40. The third is [Co(SCN)_3]^−, β3=63. The fourth is [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, β4=16.

Wait, but how do these relate to each other? The overall formation for each step is the stepwise formation constant. So the overall stability for the n-th complex would be the product of β1 * β2 * ... βn. Wait, no. Wait, each βn is the stepwise formation, so for the first complex, K1 = β1. For the second, K2 = β2, and the overall K for [Co(SCN)_2] is K1*K2 = β1*β2. Similarly, K3 for [Co(SCN)_3] is K1*K2*K3=β1*β2*β3, and so on.

But wait, perhaps another approach is better. The fraction of each complex can be determined using the stability constants and the concentrations.

The general approach is to calculate the distribution of each species based on the stability constants. The species present are Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3]^−, [Co(SCN)_4]^2−.

The fraction of each species can be found using the formula:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn) [SCN^-]^n / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 + ... )

Wait, no, more precisely, the fraction for each species is the product of the stepwise formation constants multiplied by the respective [SCN]^n, divided by the sum over all possible species (including the uncomplexed Co^2+).

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to model this as a competition between all the possible complexes. Let me think about the formation of each complex as a stepwise process.

Each complex is formed by adding one SCN- at a time. The formation constants βn are given for each step. So for the first complex, [CoSCN]^+, the formation constant is β1 = [CoSCN^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]).

Similarly, for the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2], the formation constant β2 is [Co(SCN)_2]/([CoSCN^+][SCN^-]).

But when considering the overall concentration, perhaps we can model the distribution using the cumulative formation constants.

Wait, I think the way to proceed is to compute the fractions of each species relative to the total cobalt concentration.

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species: [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2−] = c_total = 1e-2 M.

But since the solution is in equilibrium, each complex's concentration can be expressed in terms of the previous one multiplied by [SCN^-] and the respective β.

Let me denote Cn as the concentration of the n-th complex. So:

C0 = [Co^2+]  
C1 = [CoSCN^+] = β1 * C0 * [SCN^-]  
C2 = [Co(SCN)_2] = β2 * C1 * [SCN^-] = β1*β2 * C0 [SCN^-]^2  
C3 = β3 * C2 [SCN^-] = β1β2β3 C0 [SCN^-]^3  
C4 = β4 * C3 [SCN^-] = β1β2β3β4 C0 [SCN^-]^4  

Wait, but wait, each step is the addition of one SCN- to the previous complex. So for the first step, C1 = β1 * C0 * [SCN^-]. For the second step, C2 = β2 * C1 * [SCN^-] = β1 β2 C0 [SCN^-]^2. Similarly for C3 and C4.

So all the Cn can be expressed in terms of C0 and [SCN^-].

The total cobalt concentration is C0 + C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 = c_total.

So let's write that out:

C0 + C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 = C0 + β1 C0 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 C0 [SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 C0 [SCN^-]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 C0 [SCN^-]^4 = c_total.

We can factor out C0:

C0 ( 1 + β1 [S] + β1 β2 [S]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 ) = c_total,

where [S] = [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

So,

C0 = c_total / (1 + β1 [S] + β1 β2 [S]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 )

Once we have C0, the concentrations of all complexes can be found.

But wait, the question asks about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2], which is C2.

So the fraction f2 = C2 / c_total.

Alternatively, since C2 = β1 β2 [S]^2 * C0,

and c_total = C0 * (sum terms), so f2 = (β1 β2 [S]^2) / (sum terms).

So the sum terms are S = 1 + β1 [S] + β1 β2 [S]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4.

Let me compute each term step by step.

Given:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

[S]=0.1 M.

Compute each term:

Term 0 (1): 1.

Term1: β1 [S] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

Term2: β1 β2 [S]^2 = (9)(40)(0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6.

Term3: β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 = (9)(40)(63)(0.1)^3.

Let's compute that: 9*40=360, 360*63=22680. [S]^3 = 0.001. So 22680 *0.001 =22.68.

Term4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 = (9)(40)(63)(16)(0.1)^4.

Compute step by step: 9*40=360. 360*63=22680. 22680*16=362880. [S]^4= (0.1)^4=0.0001 → 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So sum S = 1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Let me compute that:

1 + 0.9 =1.9.

1.9 +3.6=5.5.

5.5 +22.68=28.18.

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

Wait, wait: 5.5 +22.68 = 28.18? Let me recheck:

5.5 + 22.68 = 5+22=27, 0.5+0.68=1.18 → 27 +1.18=28.18. Yes.

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

Wait, but 36.288 +28.18: 36 +28=64, 0.288+0.18=0.468 → 64.468.

So sum S is 64.468.

So the fraction f2 is (β1 β2 [S]^2 ) / S.

β1 β2 [S]^2 is 3.6.

So f2 = 3.6 / 64.468.

What's 3.6 /64.468?

Let me compute that. 3.6 /64 = approx 0.05625. But let me be precise.

64.468 is approximately 64.468.

3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05557 or 5.557%.

Wait, but wait, that's the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2], which is the dithiocyanato complex. The options are all in the 10s or 30s, so this can't be right. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the terms.

Let me recompute each term.

Term0: 1.

Term1: β1 [S] =9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2: β1 β2 [S]^2 =9 *40 * (0.1)^2 → 9*40=360, 360 * (0.01)=3.6.

Term3: β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 → 9 *40 *63= 9*40=360, 360*63=22680. [S]^3=0.001 → 22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 → 9 *40=360, 360 *63=22680, 22680 *16=362880. [S]^4=0.0001 → 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum S=1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So that's correct.

So f2 = 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05557 → 5.56%. But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. I think I might have made a mistake in the stability constants' approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the dithiocyanate, which might be a different structure, but I think I followed that.

Wait, maybe the problem considers all possible complexes beyond n=2 as part of the "other" species, and the question is about whether the dithiocyanato is the second complex, but perhaps the 'blue' is a different one.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the dithiocyanato refers to a different structure, but I'm not entirely sure. Let's think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute all the fractions and see which is the largest, but the problem specifically asks for the blue dithiocyanato, which is the [Co(SCN)_2] complex.

Wait, but according to the calculation, that's only about 5.5%, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait a minute. Maybe the stability constants given are for different complexes. Oh wait, perhaps the stability constants provided are for a different series. Let me recheck the problem statement.

The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, β4 is lower than β2. That's unusual because usually the higher-order complexes have higher stability constants, but perhaps that's not the case here. So in this scenario, the third complex has higher stability than the second, but the fourth is lower.

Hmm. So the formation constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the order is β1 < β2 < β3 > β4?

Wait, no, 16 is less than 63. So the order is β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So the third complex is the most stable, followed by beta2, then beta1, then beta4.

So when considering the overall formation, the dominant species would be the one with the highest product of the stepwise constants. So the third complex (n=3) would be more stable than the second (n=2), but the fourth (n=4) is less stable.

Wait, but let's think about the concentrations again. Because [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is not extremely high, so perhaps the higher n complexes may not dominate.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fractions for each complex to see what's the dominant one.

Let's compute f0, f1, f2, f3, f4.

f0 = 1 / S.

f1 = β1 [S] / S.

f2 = β1 β2 [S]^2 / S.

f3 = β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 / S.

f4 = β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 / S.

With S=64.468.

Compute each fraction:

f0: 1 /64.468 ≈0.0155 → 1.55%.

f1: (9 *0.1) /64.468 → 0.9/64.468≈0.01397 → ~1.4%.

Wait, no. Wait, f1 is [CoSCN^+] / total Co, which is (β1 [S] )/ S.

So (9 * 0.1) = 0.9. 0.9 /64.468 ≈0.01397 → about 1.4%.

f2: (9*40*(0.1)^2 ) /64.468 → 3.6 /64.468 ≈0.0556 → ~5.56%.

f3: (9*40*63*(0.1)^3 ) /64.468 → 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; (0.1)^3=0.001 → 22680 *0.001=22.68. 22.68 /64.468 ≈0.3519 → 35.19%.

f4: (9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4 ) /64.468.

Compute numerator: 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362880.

(0.1)^4=0.0001 → 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

36.288 /64.468 ≈0.5629 → 56.29%.

Wait, but wait, 36.288 /64.468 is about 0.5629?

Let me compute 64.468 * 0.5629 ≈ 64 *0.5629 ≈36. (Because 64 * 0.5=32, 64 *0.0629≈4 → 36.) So yes.

So the fractions are:

f0≈1.55%, f1≈1.4%, f2≈5.56%, f3≈35.19%, f4≈56.29%.

Wait, but that adds up to 1.55+1.4=2.95; +5.56=8.51; +35.19=43.7; +56.29=100. So that's correct.

So the dominant species is the fourth complex, [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, with about 56.29% of the total Co. But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2], which is about 5.56%. But the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait a minute, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the fractions. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, for the fourth term:

β1 β2 β3 β4 = 9 *40=360, 360 *63=22680, 22680 *16=362880. [S]^4=0.0001.

362880 *0.0001 =36.288.

36.288 /64.468 → let me compute that.

64.468 goes into 36.288 approximately 0.5629 times. So 56.29%.

Hmm, but that's the fraction of the fourth complex.

Wait, and the third term is 22.68 /64.468 ≈ 0.3519 → 35.19%. So [Co(SCN)_3]^- is 35% and [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is 56%.

So the sum of fractions is 56 +35=91%, plus the other 9% is from the lower complexes.

But according to this, [Co(SCN)_2] is about 5.56%, which is f2. But none of the options are near that. The options are 42%, 25%, 38%, 16.9%.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Another approach is to consider that the stability constants are for log values, but the problem gave β as the actual stability constants, not log β. So perhaps I should have considered the logarithms. Wait, no, the problem states the stability constants, which are the actual formation constants. So the approach should be correct.

But the answer I'm getting isn't in the options. So perhaps I got the wrong complex. Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is the third one, [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

Wait, if the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, perhaps I was mistaken in assigning n=2. Dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ligands, so n=2. But perhaps the blue color is associated with a different complex, maybe the third one. But I think the problem says "blue dithiocyanato", which would be [Co(SCN)_2].

Alternatively, perhaps the order of the stability constants is different. Wait, the problem gives β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So for the first complex, β1=9, second β2=40, third β3=63, fourth β4=16. So β3 is bigger than β2, which is bigger than β1, which is bigger than β4.

So the third complex is more stable than the second, which is more than the first, and the fourth is less than the second.

Wait, but when considering the overall formation, the product of all β up to n is what counts. So for each complex, the product up to that n determines how much it's formed.

Wait, another way: The fraction of each species is determined by the product of the β's up to that species divided by the sum of all such products plus 1 (for the free ion).

So the fraction for [Co(SCN)_n] is (β1 β2 ... βn) [S]^n / (1 + β1 [S] + β1 β2 [S]^2 + ...).

Which is exactly what I did earlier.

Wait, but the sum S is 64.468, as computed before.

So the fractions are as I calculated.

So the only way I can get an answer from the options is if I made a mistake in the calculation of the terms. Let me recheck the terms.

Term 0: 1.

Term 1: β1 [S] =9 *0.1=0.9, correct.

Term2: β1 β2 [S]^2 → 9*40=360, [S]^2=0.01 → 360 *0.01=3.6, correct.

Term3: β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 →9*40=360, 360 *63=22680, [S]^3=0.001 →22680 *0.001=22.68, correct.

Term4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 →22680 *16=362880, [S]^4=0.0001 →362880 *0.0001=36.288, correct.

Sum S=1 +0.9=1.9, +3.6=5.5, +22.68=28.18, +36.288=64.468. Correct.

So f2=3.6/64.468 ≈5.56%, but none of the options match. So perhaps the problem is not about the second complex but the first, but that doesn't make sense because "dithiocyanato" implies two SCN-.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me double-check.

Wait, [S] is 0.1 M, which is 1e-1. So [S]^n is (1e-1)^n.

Term1: [S]^1 →1e-1.

Term2: [S]^2 →1e-2.

Term3: [S]^3 →1e-3.

Term4: [S]^4 →1e-4.

So in term3, 9*40*63=22680, multiplied by 1e-3 →22.68.

Similarly, term4: 9*40*63*16=362880, multiplied by 1e-4 →36.288.

Hmm, correct.

Wait, unless the stability constants are given as log β, but that would change everything. Let me think: if β is log β, then the approach is different. But the question states "stability constants", which usually are given as the actual β, not log β. But perhaps the question is given in log scale.

Wait, if β were log β, then the calculation would be different. Let me check that possibility.

Wait, if β1=9 is actually log β1=9, then β1=1e9. That would change everything. But the given β values are 9, 40, 63, 16. If they are log β, then β1=1e9, which is huge, which would make the complexes form almost completely. But that would make the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) have a very high concentration, which would make sense with the options given.

But the problem statement says "stability constants", which are usually given as β, not log β. However, perhaps the problem is using the notation where β is the log of the formation constant. I'm a bit confused about that.

Wait, let's check the possibility that the given values are log β. Let's proceed under that assumption.

If β1=log K1=9 → K1=1e9.

Hmm, but that's a huge number. Let's see:

Term0:1.

Term1: K1 [S] =1e9 *0.1=1e8.

Term2: K1 K2 [S]^2 → K2=1e40? Because β2=40 → K2=1e40.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because K2 would be 1e40, and [S]^2=1e-2.

So term2=1e9 *1e40 *1e-2= 1e47 *1e-2=1e45.

Wait, but that would make term2 way larger than term1, which is 1e8. So the sum S would be dominated by term2, which would be 1e45, making all other terms negligible. Then the fraction f2 would be term2/S=1e45/(1e45)→100%, which isn't matching any option.

Hmm, that approach doesn't make sense. So perhaps the given β are not log β. So probably, the initial approach was correct, but then why the discrepancy with the options?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of the complexes. Let me try another approach.

Another approach is to compute the fraction of each complex in the solution.

The general formula for the fraction of the n-th complex is:

fn = (β1 β2 ... βn [S]^n) / (1 + β1 [S] + β1 β2 [S]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 + ... )

So for n=2, [Co(SCN)_2], f2 = (9 *40 * (0.1)^2) / S.

Which is (3.6) /64.468 =5.56%.

But perhaps the problem is looking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato, which is the sum of [Co(SCN)_2] and any possible other isomeric forms, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the dithiocyanato complex could refer to a different structure. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the dithiocyanato is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, but the problem might refer to [Co(SCN)_3]^− as the blue complex. But that would change the fraction.

Wait, the problem states "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." Dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ligands, so that would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0. But according to our earlier calculation, that's only about5.56%, which isn't any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of all complexes with two SCN- ions, including any possible others, but that doesn't seem likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue color is associated with a different complex, such as [Co(SCN)_3]^−. Let me see the fraction for that.

f3 is about 35.19%, which is option C (38.1%) is close but not exact. Hmm, but the question specifically says dithiocyanato, which is two SCN- ions, so that would be n=2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the stability constants. Could it be that the stability constants are cumulative, not stepwise? Wait, no, the problem states that βn are the stability constants for the complexes, which are stepwise.

Let me think of another approach: perhaps using the formula for the concentration of each species in terms of the ligand concentration and the formation constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the stability constants are for the overall complex, not stepwise, but that would require a different approach.

Wait, I'm confused. Let me try to look for similar problems or standard methods.

Another approach is using the formation of each complex step by step, considering the fraction of each species.

The formation of each complex depends on the availability of Co^2+ and the concentration of SCN^-.

At each step, the concentration of the next complex is given by:

Cn = βn * Cn-1 * [SCN^-]

So starting with C0 = [Co^2+] = c_total (initially, but it changes as complexes form).

Wait, perhaps I should set up the equations correctly.

But this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the dithiocyanato complex is the predominant one, but according to earlier calculations, it's not.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the terms, especially for term4.

Wait, let me recompute term4.

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Term4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 → 9 *40=360; 360 *63=22680; 22680 *16=362880. [S]^4=0.0001 →362880 * 0.0001 =36.288.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. So according to the calculations, the dithiocyanato complex is only about 5.56%, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Maybe the question is referring to a different n value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of all complexes with two or more SCN- ligands. So f2 + f3 + f4.

Which would be 5.56% +35.19% +56.29% =96.04%. But that's not in the options either.

Hmm, this is perplexing. Let me consider the possibility that I have misread the problem.

Wait, the problem states that the solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. So the initial concentrations are [Co]=0.01 M, [SCN-]=0.1 M.

But wait, perhaps the total concentration of Co is the sum of all species, and the [SCN-] is given, so the ligand concentration is fixed. So the approach is correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complexes, which include [Co(SCN)_2] and any other possible isomers. But I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the stability constants are given in a different way. Oh wait! Wait, another thought: perhaps the given β values are for the overall formation constants, not the stepwise. So β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2], etc. But that would change the approach.

Wait, but if that's the case, then for [Co(SCN)_2], the formation constant is β2=40. So the fraction would be different.

Wait, but usually, βn is the stepwise constant, which is the constant for adding one more ligand. So unless stated otherwise, I think the initial approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the overall formation constants for each complex, not the stepwise. For example, β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2], and so on.

In that case, the fraction of each species would be:

f_n = βn [SCN^-]^n / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

So for n=2, f2= β2 [S]^2 / (1 + β1 [S] + β2 [S]^2 + β3 [S]^3 + β4 [S]^4 )

But let's compute this.

Given:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

[S]=0.1.

Compute denominator as:

1 +9*(0.1) +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4.

Compute each term:

Term0: 1.

Term1:9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2:40 *0.01=0.4.

Term3:63 *0.001=0.063.

Term4:16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Sum S=1+0.9=1.9 +0.4=2.3 +0.063=2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator S=2.3646.

f2= (40 * (0.1)^2 ) / 2.3646.

(0.1)^2=0.01 → 40 *0.01=0.4.

So f2=0.4 /2.3646 ≈0.169 →16.9%.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.

Ah! So perhaps the problem was using the overall formation constants for each complex, not the stepwise. Because in this case, the answer matches option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought that βn is the stepwise constant, but perhaps in this problem, βn is the overall formation constant for the n-th complex. So for [Co(SCN)_2], β2=40 is the overall formation constant.

So the fractions would be calculated as follows:

For each complex, the concentration is βn [SCN]^n * [Co^2+] / (denominator).

Wait, but in reality, the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n] would be β1 * β2 * ... * βn for stepwise, but in this alternative approach, each βn is the overall formation constant up to that n.

Thus, perhaps the problem defines βn as the overall formation constant for the n-th complex, not the stepwise. If that's the case, then the approach I took in this alternative method would yield f2=16.9%, which is option D.

But why would the problem state the βs like that? Usually, stability constants are given as stepwise, but perhaps this problem defines them differently.

Given that the options include 16.9%, which matches this alternative approach, I think the problem is using the overall formation constant for each complex. So the correct answer would be option D, 16.9%.

So why did my initial approach give a different result? Because I assumed the βs were stepwise, but if they are overall, then the approach changes.

This is a critical point. If βn is the overall constant for [Co(SCN)_n], then the fraction is computed as:

fn = (βn [S]^n) / sum_{k=0}^4 (βk [S]^k )

But for k=0, β0 is 1 (since [Co^2+] is the free ion).

So in this scenario, the denominator is 1 + β1 [S] + β2 [S]^2 + β3 [S]^3 + β4 [S]^4.

Which is what I did in the alternative approach.

So with [S]=0.1,

Denominator S=1 +9*(0.1) +40*(0.01) +63*(0.001) +16*(0.0001) =1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016=2.3646.

So f2= (40*(0.01)) / 2.3646 → 0.4 /2.3646 ≈0.169 →16.9%.

So the answer is D) 16.9%.

But the question states that the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the βn for the n=2 complex is 40, which is the same as the stepwise β2 in the initial approach. So perhaps I confused the definitions.

In conclusion, the correct approach is to consider the overall formation constants for each complex, not the stepwise, which leads to the answer being 16.9%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species based on the given stability constants (β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16) and the concentrations [Co²⁺] = 10⁻² M and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.

### Key Steps:
1. **Stability Constants and Fraction Formula**:  
   The fraction of each cobalt species is determined by the formula:  
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4}
   \]  
   Here, \( \beta_n \) represents the overall stability constant for the \( n \)-th complex, and \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \).

2. **Denominator Calculation**:  
   The denominator is the sum of contributions from all cobalt species:  
   \[
   S = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   S = 1 + (9 \cdot 0.1) + (40 \cdot 0.1^2) + (63 \cdot 0.1^3) + (16 \cdot 0.1^4)
   \]  
   \[
   S = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

3. **Fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]**:  
   The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)₂]) is:  
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{S}
   \]  
   Substituting \( \beta_2 = 40 \) and \( [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 0.01 \):  
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{40 \cdot 0.01}{2.3646} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
   \]  
   Converting to a percentage:  
   \[
   f_2 \approx 16.9\%
   \]

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]) among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**, which matches option D.
