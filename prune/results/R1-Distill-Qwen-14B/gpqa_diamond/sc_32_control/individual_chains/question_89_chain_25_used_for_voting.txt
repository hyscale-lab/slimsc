Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and think through all the reactions and what's happening.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that KOH is a strong base, and when a dibromide reacts with a base, it usually undergoes an elimination reaction, like dehydrohalogenation. Since both bromines are on adjacent carbons (1 and 3 in adamantane), heating with a base like KOH would probably lead to the formation of an alkene via an E2 mechanism. Wait, but adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the positions 1 and 3 are adjacent? Hmm, maybe I should visualize the structure. Adamantane has a structure similar to a diamond, with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two carbons that are not directly adjacent, but maybe in positions that allow for elimination when the base abstracts a beta hydrogen.

Wait, but wait. E2 elimination requires the leaving groups (Br-) to be anti-periplanar to the hydrogen being abstracted. So the dihalide must have the bromines in positions that allow for that. But in adamantane, the structure is rigid. So when KOH is added, it should abstract a hydrogen that's on a carbon adjacent to each Br. So maybe the product will be a diene? Or perhaps a mono-ene. Wait, no, because there are two bromines. Wait, wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane: each Br is on a different carbon. So when both Brs leave, but wait, that's not possible for elimination. Oh wait, no. Wait, in E2, one Br leaves as the base abstracts a beta H, leading to the formation of a double bond. So if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps each Br is on two different carbons, and upon treatment with KOH, each Br can undergo elimination. But wait, if you have two Brs on two adjacent carbons, then elimination would form a double bond. Wait, but 1,3 positions on adamantane are not adjacent. Let me think about the structure. Oh, the structure of adamantane is such that the 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent carbons, but perhaps not in a way that allows for elimination. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about this differently. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not elimination, but substitution. But given that it's KOH and heating, which favors elimination. So maybe the product is an aldol-like elimination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming a diene, but I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, the product after KOH is a light yellow solid. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group. So that suggests that some kind of ketone or ester is formed. But wait, the starting material is a dihalide, so maybe it's a di-elimination, but with what? Perhaps each Br is eliminated as Br^- and forms a carbonyl. Wait, how does that work? Oh, wait, maybe each Br is replaced by an -OH group, but that would form diols, but the IR peak isn't for an alcohol. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. But wait, if you have two bromines on adjacent carbons, and eliminate each with a base, perhaps each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group. But that would require each Br to be on a carbon that can form a carbonyl upon elimination.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a double elimination, forming a conjugated diene. But the IR peak at 1720 cm^-1 doesn't fit a diene. Oh, wait, maybe it's a ketone. So perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to each Br, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. Wait, but each Br is on a different carbon. Hmm, perhaps each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group, but that would require two adjacent carbonyls, which is unlikely. Alternatively, maybe only one elimination occurs, forming a ketone. But wait, if both Brs are eliminated, perhaps it's a more complex structure.

Wait, the 1H NMR data: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm peak is probably an -OH group, but wait, no, that's more like an -OCH2- group. Because an -OH proton would be broader and maybe around 1-5 ppm, but in D2O exchange, they would disappear. Wait, but the problem says to exclude exchangeable protons. So the 4.79 ppm peak is 2H, perhaps part of an ether or a carbonyl group. Or maybe it's an -OCH2- group attached to something else.

Wait, the IR at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a ketone (around 1700-1750 cm^-1). So the product after KOH is a ketone. So perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but how do you get a ketone from a dibromide? Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an oxygen-containing group, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When treated with KOH, perhaps it undergoes a double elimination, but in such a way that the two Brs are on carbons that can each lose HBr, forming a double bond between the two carbons. But that would produce an alkene. However, the IR doesn't show a peak for an alkene (which is around 1650 cm^-1). So that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl group. Wait, but that's more like what happens when you have a geminal dihalide (two X on same carbon) and eliminate to form a carbonyl. But here, it's a vicinal dihalide (two X on adjacent carbons). Oh, wait! Vicinal dihalides can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes, but maybe under certain conditions, they can form ketones or other structures.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, but each Br is on a carbon that can form a carbonyl upon elimination. But how? Oh, wait, maybe each Br is on a carbon that's adjacent to another Br, and elimination of HBr from each forms a carbonyl group. Wait, like if you have (CH2Br)2CH2, eliminating two HBr would form (CH2O)CH2, but that's not possible because you can't have O with a double bond and another group. Hmm, maybe that's not the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. KOH could substitute each Br for an -OH group, but that would give a diol. However, the IR doesn't show broad peaks for OH groups, but a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which suggests a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, but in a way that the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, and their elimination forms a ketone. Wait, for example, if the structure is CH2Br-CH2Br, eliminating HBr twice would form CH2=CH2, but that's an alkene. Not a ketone.

Wait, maybe the starting material isn't a vicinal dihalide but a geminal dihalide. Oh wait, no, the question says 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which suggests the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. So perhaps the two Brs are not adjacent, but in positions that allow for a conjugated elimination. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a single elimination, leading to a carbonyl group. Wait, no, a single elimination of HBr from a vicinal dihalide would form an alkene, not a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, but the two Brs are in positions that allow for the formation of a ketone. Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four fused cyclohexane rings. The 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent carbons. So if you have Br on C1 and C3, and they're adjacent, then elimination of HBr from each could form a double bond between C1 and C2, or something like that. But that would give an alkene, not a ketone.

Wait, but the IR peak is at 1720, which suggests a ketone. So maybe each Br is replaced by an oxygen, leading to a diketone. But how?

Another thought: Maybe the KOH is causing a substitution reaction, replacing each Br with an -O- group, but that would lead to an epoxide or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product's NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is a singlet, perhaps an OCH2 group. The 2.41-2.23 region (10H) suggests some CH2 groups attached to something deshielded, perhaps adjacent to oxygen. The 1.94 (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl.

Putting this together, perhaps the product is a ketone with an ether group or something similar. Wait, but how does that form from a dibromide?

Wait, another approach: the reaction with KOH could be an elimination to form an epoxide. But then I'm not sure about the carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps the product is a ketone and an ether. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the next step. The product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. I know that aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 is a ketone. So if product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 could be an acylium ion or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of cyclization.

Wait, but after that, product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. That sounds like ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of alkenes typically cleaves double bonds, forming carbonyl groups.

So, if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into fragments. But I need to figure out what product 2 is first.

Wait, putting it all together:

1. Reaction 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (a ketone, perhaps (CH2)2CO or similar, as per NMR).

Wait, looking at the NMR of product 1:

- 4.79 ppm (2H): maybe an OCH2 group.
- 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H): perhaps several CH2 groups adjacent to an oxygen.
- 1.94 ppm (2H): perhaps a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's something like adamantanone. Adamantane with one ketone group. But then, how does that happen from a dibromide?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, where each Br is replaced by an oxygen group, leading to a ketone. But I'm not quite getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that elimination of HBr from each Br leads to a conjugated diene, but that doesn't fit the IR data. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product after KOH is a diketone. So each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group. But for that, the starting material would need to have the Brs on adjacent carbons, allowing each to eliminate HBr to form two ketone groups. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, another thought: in some cases, when a vicinal dihalide (two adjacent Xs) is treated with a strong base like KOH, it can undergo two dehydrohalogenation steps to form a carbonyl group. For example, vicinal dihalides can form ketones via double elimination. Wait, yes, I think that's correct. It's called a double dehydrohalogenation. So for a vicinal dihalide R-CH2-CH2-X, elimination of HX twice would form R-CH2-C≡O. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think: If you have a geminal dihalide, R-C(X)2-R', elimination would form a carbonyl. But for a vicinal dihalide, R-CH2-CH2-X, elimination would form a double bond, but I'm not sure about forming a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a 1,2-elimination to form a carbonyl, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let's think about the product after KOH: product 1 has a carbonyl group (IR at 1720) and an OCH2 group (NMR at 4.79 ppm, 2H). So maybe the structure is something like a cyclic ketone with an ethoxy group or something.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane ring with a ketone group. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. So for 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, each Br is eliminated as HBr, and the two adjacent carbons form a carbonyl group. So maybe the product is a diketone? But then the NMR would show more than one carbonyl signal.

Alternatively, maybe it's a single elimination leading to a carbonyl on each end. Hmm...

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. But the IR peak for an epoxide's C-O-C is around 1250 cm^-1, which isn't mentioned here. So probably not.

Wait, maybe it's a ketone and an epoxide. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: Let's think about the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be an -OCH2- group. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) is probably several CH2 groups adjacent to an oxygen or a carbonyl. The 1.94 (2H) might be a CH2 next to a carbonyl. So perhaps the structure is something like an adamantane ring with a ketone and an ether group.

Wait, considering that, maybe product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mono-ketone and an ether.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH is a double elimination, forming a carbonyl group. So each Br is on a carbon adjacent to each other, and eliminating both HBr would form a carbonyl group. So, if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, eliminating two HBr would form a double bond. Wait, but that's not a ketone. Unless it's a carbonyl group as part of a ring.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the next steps. Once product 1 is formed, it's heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. AlCl3 or Al-based reagents are often used in Friedel-Crafts, but product 1 is a ketone. So perhaps product 2 is an acylium ion or something else. Or maybe it's undergoing some kind of cyclization.

Alternatively, aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, so it could facilitate the formation of an acylium ion from a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: if product 1 is a ketone, then heating with a Lewis acid might induce some kind of rearrangement, like a keto-enol tautomerism or some ring formation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that requires an aromatic ring and a ketone. So if product 1 has an aromatic ring, then product 2 would be an aryl ketone. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane ring with a ketone, and the aluminum isopropoxide is causing ring-opening or something else.

Hmm, perhaps I should move forward to the ozonolysis step. Ozone is used for cleaving double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyl groups. Then, the product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

So, putting this together, product 1 is a ketone. Product 2 must have a double bond because ozonolysis is used. So how does product 1 become product 2 with a double bond?

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something that can form a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but earlier I thought that might not fit. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps product 1 is the result of a substitution reaction, not elimination. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester. The IR at 1720 could be an ester carbonyl. So if product 1 is an ester, then heating with aluminum isopropoxide (a Lewis acid) could cause some kind of ring-opening or elimination, forming a double bond.

Wait, if product 1 is an ester, then heating with a Lewis acid could cause it to lose an ester group and form a double bond. For example, in the formation of an acylium ion, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone. Then, treatment with a Lewis acid could cause it to open, forming a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic structure with a ketone and an ether. Then, heating with aluminum isopropoxide could cause some rearrangement.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure of product 1, it's challenging. Maybe I should think about the ozonolysis step. Product 2, when ozonized, forms product 3. Ozonolysis typically breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond. Therefore, product 1 must have undergone a reaction that introduces a double bond when treated with aluminum isopropoxide.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, but that doesn't fit the IR data. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ether with a ketone group.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ether with a ketone, and product 2 is an alkene formed by some elimination. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, but the IR doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the ozonolysis step. If product 3's NMR has a coupling pattern for the most deshielded proton, which is not exchangeable. Ozonolysis tends to break double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, then product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

Assuming product 2 is an alkene, after ozonolysis, it would form two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 was CH2=CH-R, ozonolysis would form two aldehyde or ketone groups.

But what about the coupling? The most deshielded proton would likely be on a carbonyl group, but in ozonolysis, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded.

Wait, but ozonolysis followed by work-up (like with dimethyl sulfide) typically leads to the formation of carbonyl groups. So, in product 3, any protons adjacent to carbonyls would be deshielded.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton in product 3.

Assuming product 3 has a structure with a carbonyl group and adjacent protons, let's think about their coupling.

Wait, if the structure is something like R-CO-CH2-CH2-..., then the CH2 protons next to the carbonyl would couple with each other and perhaps with neighboring groups.

But perhaps it's a cyclic structure. Alternatively, if the ozonolysis breaks a symmetrical double bond, the resulting structure might have equivalent protons.

Wait, let's think about an example. Suppose product 2 is a cyclic diene, like cyclohexene. Ozonolysis would break it into two ketones or aldehydes. But in a more complex structure, perhaps product 3 has conjugated carbonyl groups.

But I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should think about the coupling patterns. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

Triplet implies two neighboring protons. Triplet of triplets would be coupling with two different sets of protons. A doublet of triplets would mean coupling with two different groups. A pentet is four neighboring protons.

The most deshielded proton is probably adjacent to a carbonyl group. In such cases, the protons are usually split by adjacent groups. For example, if a CH2 group is next to a carbonyl, each proton on the CH2 would couple with the other (as a triplet), but also with any neighboring groups.

Alternatively, if the deshielded proton is part of a CH group next to a carbonyl, it might couple with adjacent protons.

Wait, another scenario: the deshielded proton is part of a vinyl group, but that's unlikely after ozonolysis.

Wait, maybe product 2 has a structure like a cyclopropane ring with a double bond. Then, ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyls, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a bicyclic compound with a double bond that, upon ozonolysis, forms a ketone and some other groups.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structures, perhaps I should think about the possible coupling patterns.

If a proton is adjacent to two sets of neighboring protons, it could result in a triplet of triplets. For example, if it's next to a CH2 group (two protons) and also next to another CH2 group (two protons), each coupling would split the signal. Alternatively, if it's next to a CH group and a CH2 group, that could lead to more splitting.

Alternatively, a deshielded proton could be part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Each proton in the CH2 would couple with the other (as a triplet), and if they're next to another CH2 group, each might couple with those as well, leading to more splitting.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the most deshielded proton. It's probably on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. So each proton on that CH2 would be split by the neighboring CH2 groups.

For example, imagine a structure like O=C-R-CH2-CH2-X. The protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl (R) would be deshielded. Each of these protons would couple with the adjacent CH2 protons. So each would have two neighboring protons (from the adjacent CH2), leading to a triplet. But if the adjacent CH2 is also coupled with another group, the splitting could compound.

Wait, but if the adjacent group is another CH2, each proton would have two neighboring protons from the same group and possibly others from elsewhere. Alternatively, if the adjacent group is a CH, each proton would split into a doublet.

Wait, perhaps the deshielded protons are part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to another CH2 group. So each proton in the first CH2 would couple with two protons from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But wait, that's the same group, so the splitting would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if the adjacent group is a CH, each proton in the first CH2 would couple with two protons from that CH, but that seems less likely.

Hmm, I'm not getting much further. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, the NMR data for product 1: the 4.79 ppm is 2H, perhaps an -OCH2- group. The 1.94 (2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be several CH2 groups in a more shielded environment.

Putting this together, product 1 might be something like a ketone with an adjacent -OCH2- group, perhaps in a bridged bicyclic structure.

When product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, perhaps the Lewis acid induces the formation of a double bond. For example, if product 1 has an alcohol group that loses a water molecule to form a double bond, but that would require an acid catalyst, which fits with using a Lewis acid.

Wait, but product 1 is a ketone. If it's a cyclic ketone, perhaps the Lewis acid helps in ring-opening to form a double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 has an ester group, and the Lewis acid facilitates elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a bicyclic ketone with an ether bridge. Heating with a Lewis acid could induce the formation of a double bond by eliminating a small molecule, like water, leading to a ring contraction or expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a dienophile or some conjugated diene.

After ozonolysis, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was. The coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton would depend on its neighboring groups.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, and the deshielded proton is on a CH2 group adjacent to two ketone groups. So each CH2 proton would couple with two protons from another CH2 group, leading to a triplet. But if they are adjacent to another group, the splitting could be more.

Alternatively, if the deshielded proton is part of a CH group next to two different types of protons, it could be a triplet of triplets or another pattern.

Wait, let me think of a specific example. Suppose product 2 has a structure like CH2=CH-CH2-C(O)R.

After ozonolysis, this would form two carbonyl groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a bicyclic compound with a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls, creating a diketone.

Assuming that, the structure of product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, and any CH2 groups adjacent to them would have deshielded protons.

The most deshielded proton would likely be on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl. Each proton in that CH2 would couple with the other (as a triplet) and perhaps with protons from adjacent groups.

Wait, but if the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, each proton would couple with two others, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if it's adjacent to a CH group, each proton would couple with two others, but that might lead to a triplet.

Wait, but let me think about the splitting. Each proton in the CH2 has two neighboring protons (the other in the same CH2), so that's a triplet. But if the CH2 is next to another CH2 group, each proton would also couple with those two, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but that would require each proton to be coupling with two different sets of two protons each, which is possible. So for a proton that is adjacent to two different CH2 groups, each with two protons, the splitting would be a triplet (from the same CH2) and then each of those triplets would be further split by the next CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the adjacent group is a CH group, which has one proton, each proton would be split into a doublet. Then, if there's another adjacent group with two protons (CH2), each proton would be split into a triplet, leading to a doublet of triplets.

Wait, but the most deshielded proton is probably adjacent to only one other proton group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group that's adjacent to another CH2 group and a carbonyl. So each proton in the first CH2 would couple with the two protons in the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But if the first CH2 is also next to a carbonyl, which has no protons, then the coupling would only be with the adjacent CH2. So it would be a triplet.

But wait, the options include 'triplet of triplets' and 'doublet of triplets'.

Alternatively, the deshielded proton could be next to a CH2 group and another group with two protons, leading to a total of four neighboring protons, hence a pentet. But that's an option (D).

Alternatively, perhaps the deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 group, which is adjacent to another CH2 group. In that case, each proton would couple with 2 (from the first adjacent CH2) and 2 (from the next), leading to a triplet of triplets.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about what the correct answer is, based on the options.

The options are A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

If the deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group adjacent to two other CH2 groups, each with two protons, then each proton would have 2 + 2 =4 neighboring protons, leading to a quintet (pentet). But that's option D.

Alternatively, if the proton is adjacent to one CH2 (2H) and another group with two protons, that would be 4, again a pentet.

Alternatively, perhaps it's adjacent to a single CH group (1H) and a CH2 (2H), leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is a triplet of triplets, which is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning leading to the answer:

---

### Step 1: Reaction with KOH
1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH, resulting in a light yellow solid product 1. The IR spectrum shows a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group. This suggests that the reaction involves elimination of HBr from the vicinal dihalide, forming a ketone. The NMR data for product 1:
- **4.79 ppm (2H)**: Likely corresponds to an -OCH₂ group.
- **2.41-2.23 ppm (10H)**: Shielded CH₂ groups, possibly adjacent to oxygen or a carbonyl.
- **1.94 ppm (2H)**: CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl.

This indicates that product 1 is likely a ketone with an ether group, such as a bicyclic structure containing a carbonyl and an -OCH₂ group.

---

### Step 2: Reaction with Aluminum Isopropoxide
Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, a strong Lewis acid. This step likely induces further structural changes, such as the formation of a double bond. The exact mechanism is unclear, but product 2 likely contains a double bond, as ozonolysis is performed in the next step.

---

### Step 3: Ozonolysis and Work-Up
Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, forming carbonyl groups in product 3. The most deshielded proton in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group and likely part of a CH₂ group. This proton couples with neighboring protons, leading to a specific splitting pattern.

---

### Analysis of Coupling Patterns
The coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton depends on its neighboring groups:
- **Triplet**: Two neighboring protons (e.g., from a CH₂ group).
- **Triplet of triplets**: Two sets of two neighboring protons (e.g., adjacent to two CH₂ groups).
- **Doublet of triplets**: Coupling with one proton and two protons from another group.
- **Pentet**: Four neighboring protons (e.g., adjacent to two CH₂ groups).

Given the structure of product 3, the most deshielded proton is likely part of a CH₂ group adjacent to two CH₂ groups. Each proton in this CH₂ group couples with two protons from one CH₂ group (forming a triplet) and with two protons from another CH₂ group (further splitting the triplet into a triplet of triplets).

---

### Conclusion
The coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in product 3 is a **triplet of triplets**.

**Answer: B**
