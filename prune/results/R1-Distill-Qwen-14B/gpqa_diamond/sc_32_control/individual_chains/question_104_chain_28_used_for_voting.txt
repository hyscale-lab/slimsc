Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, so the scenario is that there are two stars of the same mass, each with a planet around them. The planets have masses similar to Neptune. Astronomers are using the radial velocity (RV) method to detect them. Both planets have circular orbits. 

The key data points given are the shifts in the spectral lines of their host stars. For Planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for Planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines. The star moves towards and away from us as the planet orbits, causing the spectral lines to shift. The size of the shift depends on the mass of the planet and the star's velocity towards/away from us.

Wait, the formula I think is related to the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity, K. The formula for K is something like K = (v) = (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) )) )^(1/1) ) * (some factor). Oh wait, maybe I should recall the exact formula. I think the formula for K is:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2 * pi * (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) ] * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star)^(2/3) ) )

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * ( 1/( (2 pi) * P )^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it in terms of Kepler's third law. Because Kepler's law relates the orbital period and the semi-major axis to the masses.

Kepler's third law in the context of exoplanets is often written as:

P^2 = (4 π² / G(M_star + M_p)) ) * a^3

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (because Neptune is much less massive than the Sun), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So that simplifies to P^2 = (4 π² a³)/(G M_star). So P is proportional to (a^3/(M_star))^½.

But how does this connect to the radial velocity shift? Oh right, the radial velocity K is related to the velocity of the star in its orbit around the barycenter. The formula I think is:

K = (v) = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1/P)^(1/3) )

Wait, let me write this more accurately. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (2 π P ) )^(1/3) )

Hmm, but since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So sin i is approximately 1 since the orbit is edge-on (but they don't specify, so maybe it's a factor we can't ignore, but perhaps the question assumes sin i is the same for both planets, which it probably is since it's not mentioned otherwise).

So, K ≈ (G M_p )^(1/3) * (1/(2 π M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )) )

Wait, that might not be the right way to arrange it. Let me think again. Alternatively, the expression for K is:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2 π P ))^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to look up the exact formula. Oh wait, the exact formula for K is:

K = [ (2 pi G ) / (c) ]^(1/3) * [ (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ] / ( (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula, but perhaps I can think of it in terms of the relationship between K and P.

I know that for the same star mass, if the planet masses are the same, then K should be inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. Because from Kepler's third law, P is proportional to a^(3/2) / (sqrt(M)), but since M is same for both stars, a is proportional to P^(2/3). 

Wait, let's think about the RV semi-amplitude formula again. The semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ]^(1) * (1/(2 π P ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me write the formula for K in terms of other variables.

K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Because using the formula:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (2 π P ) )^(1/3 )

So, K ∝ (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Given that both stars have the same mass (M_star is same for both), and both planets have similar masses (so M_p is same for both), then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)) → P ∝ 1/(K^(3))

Wait, let's see. So if K1 is the semi-amplitude for planet 1, K2 for planet 2, then:

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) * (M_p2 / M_p1) * (M_star2 / M_star1)^(2/3) )

But in our case, M_p1 ≈ M_p2 (both Neptune mass), and M_star1 = M_star2 (same mass as Sun). So:

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So rearranged,

(P2/P1) = (K1 / K2 )^3

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The ratio K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → So (K1/K2)^3 = (P2/P1)

Wait, if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to 1/K^(3). So for K1 and K2, the periods are P1 and P2.

So, P1 = C / K1^3, P2 = C / K2^3, where C is a constant (since M_p and M_star are same for both).

So the ratio P2/P1 = (C/K2^3) / (C/K1^3) ) = (K1/K2)^3

Wait, that can't be right because higher K would mean shorter period. Because if K is larger, the star's velocity is higher, which requires a shorter period for the same mass. So if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K2 > K1 → P2 < P1.

But wait, according to the calculation, if (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3, then P2 is less than P1 when K2 > K1.

Which is correct because a higher K (which is the velocity amplitude) implies that the star is moving faster, which for the same mass star and same planet mass, would mean a shorter period (since the star has to orbit more quickly to have a higher velocity for the same mass—maybe I got that backwards).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star. If the star's velocity is higher, that can be because the planet is more massive (but same here), or because the orbital period is shorter. Because for a given planet mass, a shorter period would mean the star orbits the barycenter more quickly, leading to a higher K.

Wait, so if K2 is larger than K1, that implies that Planet #2's orbit has a shorter period than Planet #1. So P2 < P1.

Which aligns with the formula P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. K1 is 5 milliangstroms, K2 is7.

So K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So (K1/K2)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 ≈ 0.364, which is approximately 0.36 times.

Wait, but the options are A) ~0.36, B) ~1.40, C) ~1.96, D) ~0.85.

So the answer would be A) ~0.36.

Wait, but let me double-check because I might have swapped something. Because P is proportional to (a^3)/(M_star), and a is the semi-major axis, but a is also related to the orbital period via Kepler's law. But for the same star mass, a is proportional to P^(2/3). So if K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)), then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1/K^3.

So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1 by a factor of (K1/K2)^3.

So the ratio P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 125/343 ≈ 0.364. So Planet #2's period is about 0.36 times that of Planet #1. So the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So (P2/P1) is about 0.36, which is shorter, so P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter, not longer. But the question says, "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

So if the period is shorter, then it's 0.36 times as long. So the answer is 0.36 times, which is option A.

Wait, but maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. Let me write the relationship more carefully.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1 / (P * c) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps that's complicating it. Alternatively, another approach is to use the formula that relates K to the orbital period and other parameters.

The formula I found online before (from memory) is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3) )

Wait, no, perhaps another way. Let me think in terms of the star's velocity.

The star's velocity is related to the planet's orbit. The star's velocity (v) is given by v = (2 pi a) / P, where a is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the barycenter. And the planet's orbit has semi-major axis a_p, while the star's is a_s, with a_p * M_p = a_s * M_star.

Thus, a_s = (M_p / M_star) * a_p.

But from Kepler's third law, (a_p + a_s)^3 = (G (M_star + M_p) P^2 )/(4 pi^2 )

But since M_p << M_star, a_p + a_s ≈ a_p = (G M_star P^2 )/(4 pi^2 )^(1/3 )

But a_s = (M_p / M_star) a_p, so a_s = (M_p / M_star) * [ (G M_star P^2 )/(4 pi^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

Thus, the star's velocity is v = 2 pi a_s / P = 2 pi ( M_p / M_star ) * [ (G M_star P^2 )/(4 pi^2 ) ]^(1/3 ) / P.

Simplify that:

v = 2 pi ( M_p / M_star ) * [ (G M_star P^2 )/(4 pi^2 ) ]^(1/3 ) * (1/P )

Let me compute the exponents.

Inside the cube root:

(G M_star P^2 )/(4 pi^2 ) = (G M_star) * P^2 / (4 pi^2 )

So the cube root is [G M_star]^(1/3) * [P^2]^(1/3) / [4 pi^2]^(1/3 )

So [P^2]^(1/3) = P^(2/3)

Putting it all together:

v = 2 pi * (M_p / M_star) * [ G^(1/3) M_star^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / (4 pi^2 )^(1/3) ) ] * (1/P )

The denominator (4 pi^2 )^(1/3) is (4)^(1/3) (pi)^(2/3).

So now, let's collect terms:

v = 2 pi * (M_p / M_star) * [ G^(1/3) M_star^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) ] / [ (4)^(1/3) pi^(2/3) ) ] * (1/P )

Simplify:

Factor of 2 pi / [ (4)^(1/3) pi^(2/3) ) ]

4^(1/3) is 2^(2/3), so 2 pi / (2^(2/3) pi^(2/3)) ) = [ 2^(1) * pi^(1) ] / [ 2^(2/3) pi^(2/3) ) ]

Which is 2^(1 - 2/3) * pi^(1 - 2/3) = 2^(1/3) * pi^(1/3)

So v = [ 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) ) ] * (M_p / M_star) * G^(1/3) M_star^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) * 1/P

Simplify the exponents:

M_p / M_star * M_star^(1/3) = M_p * M_star^(-2/3)

P^(2/3) * (1/P) = P^(-1/3)

So:

v = 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) * G^(1/3) * M_p * M_star^(-2/3) * P^(-1/3)

Factor everything:

v = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * M_p / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

So K (the semi-amplitude) is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

So K ∝ ( M_p ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) )

In our problem, M_p is same for both planets, and M_star is same for both stars. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) → P^(1/3) ∝ 1/K → P ∝ 1/K^3.

So for two planets, P1 and P2:

P1 ∝ 1/K1^3, P2 ∝ 1/K2^3.

The ratio P2/P1 = (1/K2^3) / (1/K1^3) ) = (K1 / K2 )^3.

So now, substituting the given K1=5, K2=7.

K1/K2 =5/7.

So (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1≈0.364, which is approximately 0.36 times. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. Which means it's shorter, not longer.

But the question asks, "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, that means it's 0.36 times as long as P1. Therefore, it's shorter, so the period is 0.36 times, so the number of times longer is 0.36 times. So the answer is A.

The problem involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, given that both planets orbit stars of the same mass and have similar masses to Neptune. The radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude, \( K \), is provided for both planets: \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) for Planet #1 and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) for Planet #2.

The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), i.e., \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \). This relationship arises from the formula for \( K \), which depends on the orbital period, the mass of the planet, and the mass of the star. Since the stars and planets have the same masses, the ratio of the periods can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1, the answer is \( 0.36 \).
