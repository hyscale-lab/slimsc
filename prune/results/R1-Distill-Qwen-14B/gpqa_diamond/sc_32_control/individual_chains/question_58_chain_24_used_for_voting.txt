Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I need to figure out which theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Let's break this down.

First, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergencesâ€”those pesky infinities that pop up and mess things up. The idea is to introduce a cutoff or some other method to make calculations finite and then remove the regularization in the end. But some theories might not need this because they're either free from such divergences or have another mechanism.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Superstring Theory. Oh, right, string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity. I think strings have a different way of handling things. Since they're one-dimensional objects, maybe they avoid some of the divergences that point particles (like in QED or QCD) have. Plus, superstring theory is a type of quantum theory, but maybe it doesn't need the same kind of regularization because of the way it handles high energies.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that at high energies (or equivalently, short distances), QCD becomes asymptotically free, meaning the coupling constant decreases, and quarks behave almost like free particles. But wait, does that mean they don't have divergences? Or does it just mean it's manageable? I think QCD still requires regularization because, even if it's asymptotically free, the calculations can still lead to divergences. Like, loop diagrams can cause problems, so you need to regularize them.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I remember that in QED, when you calculate things like the electron's self-energy or photon vacuum polarization, you get divergent integrals. These divergences are handled using regularization techniques like introducing a cutoff, dimensional regularization, etc. So QED definitely requires regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Classical theories don't have the same issues as quantum ones. In Maxwell's theory, you don't have infinities because you're not dealing with quantized fields or virtual particles. For example, the classical electron doesn't have a self-energy problem because it's treated as a point charge, and while that leads to some issues like the infinite Coulomb potential energy, those are more philosophical or mathematical rather than practical for calculations. But in the context of regularization, which is a quantum field theory tool, classical theories wouldn't require it. So maybe D is the answer.

Wait, but the question is about high energies. Do any of these theories avoid needing regularization when energy is high?

In QED, at high energies, you still have the same divergences. For example, the renormalization process is about dealing with these. Superstring theory, as I thought before, might not require the same kind because it's a different framework. But wait, superstring theory does involve quantizing strings, so when you compute loop diagrams, perhaps they don't have the same divergences? Or maybe they do, but they use different methods. I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Alternatively, classical theories don't need regularization because they aren't quantized. So in the realm of classical electrodynamics, you don't have the quantum divergences, so you don't need regularization. So option D would be the one that never requires regularization.

Wait, the question says "physical theories" so it's about which theory doesn't need regularization. If a theory is free from divergences, it wouldn't need regularization. Alternatively, if it's a classical theory, it doesn't require regularization because regularization is a quantum concept.

So looking again, the options are A to D, with D being classical. So which among these doesn't require regularization. Since all quantum theories (A, B, C) probably require some form of regularization when dealing with high energies, and classical theories (D) don't. So the answer would be D.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the options:

- **Option A: Superstring Theory**  
  Superstring theory is a quantum theory that describes particles as one-dimensional strings. While it avoids some divergences due to the nature of strings, it still involves quantizing strings and calculating loop diagrams, which can lead to divergences. Thus, it likely requires regularization in practice.

- **Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**  
  QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, describing quarks and gluons. At high energies, QCD becomes asymptotically free, but this does not eliminate divergences in loop calculations. Regularization is still necessary to handle these divergences.

- **Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**  
  QED is the theory of electromagnetism, describing interactions between charged particles and photons. It is notorious for requiring regularization due to divergences in calculations like electron self-energy and vacuum polarization. Techniques like dimensional regularization are commonly used.

- **Option D: Classical Electrodynamics**  
  Classical electrodynamics, based on Maxwell's equations, deals with classical fields and point charges. Unlike quantum theories, it does not involve quantized fields or virtual particles, which are the sources of divergences in quantum field theories. While classical theories have their own mathematical challenges (e.g., infinite Coulomb potential energy), they do not require regularization in the quantum sense.

Since regularization is a tool specific to quantum field theories to handle divergences, classical electrodynamics does not require it. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: D
