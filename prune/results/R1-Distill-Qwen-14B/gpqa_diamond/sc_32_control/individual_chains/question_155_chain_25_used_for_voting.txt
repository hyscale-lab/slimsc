Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. It's about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator given a specific state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So, the setup is that we have an operator P with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. The matrices for each of these are given. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which probably means that the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. Oh wait, no, the problem says the system is found in the eigenstate of P_x corresponding to eigenvalue -ħ. But wait, wait, looking again, the explicit state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So this is the state vector.

The question is to find the uncertainty ΔP_z, which is the standard deviation of P_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the expectation value of P_z squared minus the square of the expectation value of P_z.

So the formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). 

But first, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. Since we're given the state vector, and the operator P_z is given, I can compute these using matrix multiplication.

Wait, the state is a column vector, so it's a 3x1 matrix. Let me write it out:

The state vector ψ is:
[-1/2]
[1/√2]
[-1/2]

So ψ = [a, b, c]^T where a=-1/2, b=1/√2, c=-1/2.

Now, let's find the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩. P_z is given as a 3x3 matrix with first row [ħ, 0, 0], second row [0,0,0], third row [0,0,-ħ].

So, ⟨P_z⟩ = ψ^† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, this should be straightforward.

Each diagonal element is the eigenvalue for the corresponding basis state. So for each component i, the expectation is ψ_i^* * (P_z)_ii * ψ_i.

But since the basis is real (since the eigenvectors are real, probably), the conjugate won't matter here. So:

⟨P_z⟩ = ( (-1/2)^2 * ħ ) + ( (1/√2)^2 * 0 ) + ( (-1/2)^2 * (-ħ) )

Wait, let me compute each term:

First term: ( (-1/2) )^2 * ħ = (1/4) ħ
Second term: (1/√2)^2 * 0 = 1/2 * 0 = 0
Third term: ( (-1/2) )^2 * (-ħ) = (1/4) (-ħ) = - (1/4) ħ

So adding them up: (1/4 ħ) + 0 + (-1/4 ħ) = 0.

So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Now, ⟨P_z²⟩ is just ψ^† P_z^2 ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z² is just each diagonal element squared.

So P_z squared matrix is:

[ (ħ)^2, 0, 0 ],
[ 0, 0, 0 ],
[ 0, 0, ( -ħ )^2 ] → which is ħ².

So, P_z² is a diagonal matrix with entries ħ², 0, ħ².

So now, ⟨P_z²⟩ is:

( (-1/2)^2 * ħ² ) + ( (1/√2)^2 * 0 ) + ( (-1/2)^2 * ħ² )

Each term:

First term: (1/4) ħ²
Second term: 0
Third term: (1/4) ħ²

So total is (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/2) ħ²

Now, ΔP_z is sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - (0)^2 ) ) → sqrt(1/2 ħ² ) = (ħ) / sqrt(2 )

So the uncertainty is ħ / sqrt(2 ), which is option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state vector is given as:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The operator $P_z$ is diagonal with elements $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ along the diagonal. Since the basis is real, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^T P_z \psi.
\]

Breaking it down:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar + 0 - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$.

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is also diagonal, with elements $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^T P_z^2 \psi.
\]

Breaking it down:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2$.

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
