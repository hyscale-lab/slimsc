Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem states that a chemist performed two reactions with two unknown compounds A and B. Each was treated with a different reducing agent: LiBH4 and BH3. The products from both reactions are given as (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. I'm supposed to determine which starting materials (A and B) correspond to each reagent to get the correct products.

The options are A, B, C, D, each pairing A and B as different stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, I think the starting materials might be ketones or esters undergoing reduction to form the cyclic hemiacetal or something similar.

Wait, the products are tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-ones. Pyran is a six-membered ring with an oxygen, so pyran-2-one would be a cyclic ketone. The substituents are 4-ethyl. So the structure would be a six-membered ring with an oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

So the product is a cyclic hemiacetal? Or maybe a cyclic ketone. Let me think. The product is a cyclic hemiacetal of a diol and a ketone. Or perhaps it's a result of a Claisen or aldol condensation followed by ring formation.

Wait, the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Hmm. So that's a pentanoic acid (five carbons) with an ester group (isobutoxy) and a ketone (oxo) on the same carbon (5-oxo), and an ethyl group on carbon 3.

Wait, 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the structure is CH2CH2 (ethyl) on C3, an isobutoxy group and a ketone on C5. Wait, no: pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but substituents are on C3 and C5. So:

The molecule is: 

CH2CH2 (ethyl) - then CH2? Then the 5-position has isobutoxy and oxo, and the 5th carbon is also the carboxylic acid?

Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to structure it correctly.

The formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but that's five carbons. Wait, nomenclature—pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH, with the COOH on the first carbon. So the substituents in this molecule are:

At position 3: ethyl group.

At position 5: isobutoxy and oxo groups. Wait, position 5 in pentanoic acid would be the same as the COOH group, so that can't be right. Or perhaps the structure is different.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the numbering. Let me think again. Pentanoic acid has five carbons in total, with the COOH at the end. So numbering from the COOH end, position 1 is COOH, position 2 is the adjacent carbon, and so on. So, 5-oxo would be on the last carbon, same as the COOH, which doesn't make sense because that would be the same carbon as COOH. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should imagine the structure. Let me draw it.

Pentanoic acid: CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So numbering from COOH as 1, the chain is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5? No, wait, no. Wait, wait, no. Wait, for pentanoic acid, the structure is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. So the COOH is on C1, and the chain is four CH2 groups? No, wait, wait. Let me think differently. The formula is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but that's actually four carbons before COOH, so it's pentanoic acid (five carbons including COOH). So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's six carbons. Wait, no—pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, which is five carbons in total. So the COOH is on C1, and the chain is four more carbons? No, no. Wait, I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me recall: the formula for pentanoic acid is C5H10O2. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, which is five carbons in a chain. So numbering from COOH as 1:

1: COOH

2: CH2

3: CH2

4: CH2

5: CH3 (but wait, that would be five carbons as 1,2,3,4,5).

Wait, that can't be right because that would make the chain four CH2 groups leading to a methyl. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

COOH-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)... Wait, no, perhaps the substituents are on the third and fifth carbons.

Wait, the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, pentanoic acid, so five carbons in total, COOH on C1. Then on C3, an ethyl group. On C5, both isobutoxy and oxo groups. But C5 is the last carbon, which is also adjacent to COOH.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because in pentanoic acid, the last carbon (C5) is the methyl group (CH3) attached to C4. How can C5 have both an isobutoxy group and a ketone? Unless it's a branched structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-C(OCH2CH(CH2)2)-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)

Wait, no, that's getting too complicated. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the reactions.

The products are both 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, but with opposite configurations (R and S). So the products are enantiomers. So the reaction conditions must be leading to the formation of a chiral center.

Wait, the reaction is a reduction. LiBH4 and BH3 are different reducing agents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used for ketones to form secondary alcohols. BH3 is a borane, which is used in hydroboration reactions, typically for alkenes to form alcohols, or in some cases for ketone reductions?

Wait, no, actually, BH3 is used in the reduction of ketones as well, but perhaps under different conditions. Wait, no, BH3 is a Lewis acid, often used in hydroboration-oxidation, but when used with other reagents, it can reduce ketones. Alternatively, perhaps in the presence of a proton source, it can act as a reducing agent.

Wait, perhaps both reactions involve the reduction of a ketone. Let me think. The starting material is an acid with an ester and ketone groups. So if it's an ester, perhaps it's an acyl group that can be reduced.

Wait, the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-isobutyl)-O.

Wait, no, wait, isobutoxy is O-CH2CH(CH2)2 ? No, isobutoxy is OCH(CH2CH3)2? Wait, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2)2? Hmm, no. Isobutyl group is (CH2)2CHCH2-? Wait, no. Isobutyl is (CH2CH2)CH2-, wait, no. Isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2.

Wait, no, the isobutoxy group is OCH2CH(CH3)2. So the structure is:

The pentanoic acid chain is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-OCH2CH(CH3)2).

Wait, but that's a bit confusing. Maybe I should think about the reaction leading to the product.

The product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one with an ethyl group at position 4. So perhaps the starting material undergoes a ring-forming reaction, like a Claisen or Aldol condensation, followed by reduction.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester. Oh wait, yes! Because the molecule is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So it's a β-keto acid, perhaps. Let me see: a β-keto acid has a ketone group adjacent to the carboxylic acid.

So, the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-C(O-R)-CO-R'? Wait, no, perhaps it's more like:

O
||
O-C-OCH2CH(CH3)2

But I'm not getting it right. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is:

CH2-C(O-OCH2CH(CH3)2)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-COOH.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's 5-oxo and 5-isobutoxy, which would make the same carbon (C5) have both an oxygen substituent (isobutoxy) and a ketone. That can't happen, unless it's a geminal di-substitution, which is possible in certain cases.

Wait, but geminal di-substitution is when two groups are on the same carbon. So 5-oxo and 5-isobutoxy would mean the same carbon has both a ketone (O) and an isobutoxy group (OCH2CH(CH3)2). So maybe it's:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(OCH2CH(CH3)2)=O

Wait, that would make a gem-diketone, which is possible, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is an ester. Because the name is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Wait, that can't be right. If it's pentanoic acid, then the 'acid' part is COOH on carbon 1. Then, on carbon 5, which is carbon 5, which would be the end, but in a five-carbon chain, carbon 5 is the methyl group. So having a substituent there is possible, but perhaps it's an ester group.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2)- something. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The pentanoic acid is such that:

- C1: COOH

- C2: CH2

- C3: CH(CH2CH3)

- C4: C(O-OCH2CH(CH3)2)

- C5: perhaps another substituent?

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction step.

The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the product is a six-membered ring with an oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

So perhaps the starting material is undergoing a cyclization reaction. For example, the β-keto acid could undergo a decarboxylation to form a cyclic ketone after losing CO2.

Wait, another approach: LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and BH3 is a milder one, perhaps. In the presence of H+, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed process.

Wait, but in the given reactions, both A and B are treated with different reagents and give the same product but with opposite configurations.

Wait, the products are (R) and (S) enantiomers. So the reaction must involve the formation of a chiral center.

Assuming that the starting material has a carbonyl group that upon reduction forms a chiral center.

Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the ring has six members. The positions are:

O at position 1, then positions 2,3,4,5,6. The ketone is at position 2, so it's a ring with O at position 1, carbonyl at 2, and ethyl at 4.

So the ring is:

O (position 1), C=O (position 2), then position 3, 4 (ethyl), position 5, 6 (maybe a CH2 or something).

So when the ring is formed, perhaps the starting material's groups form the ring. Maybe the starting material is a β-keto ester or acid that undergoes a ring-forming reduction.

Wait, another angle: the product is a cyclic hemiacetal of a diol and a ketone. But that's not likely because the product is an open-chain ketone in a ring. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester that undergoes a Claisen condensation to form a ring.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an ester with a β-keto group. So when treated with a reducing agent, the ketone is reduced to an alcohol, which then forms a ring.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the starting material structure. Let me think about the possible reactions.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions, but in some cases, perhaps for ketone reductions as well. Wait, no, BH3 is more commonly used for alkene reductions via hydroboration-oxidation. So perhaps the conditions are different.

Wait, another thought: when a β-keto ester is treated with a reducing agent, the ketone can be reduced, but the ester might remain.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester that, upon reduction, forms a secondary alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, which upon reduction of the ester group (like saponification to a carboxylic acid?), but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto acid, which upon decarboxylation forms a ring.

Wait, β-keto acids can undergo decarboxylation upon heating, losing CO2 and forming a ketone. So, if the starting material is a β-keto acid, perhaps with some substituents that allow cyclization upon decarboxylation.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto acid with an adjacent ester group. Let me model it.

Suppose the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CO-O-R

But with substituents. Wait, perhaps it's something like:

The starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the molecule is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-OCH2CH(CH3)2)-something.

Wait, but the '5-oxo' and '5-isobutoxy' are on the same carbon, which is the fourth carbon in a five-carbon chain. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a secondary alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyran ring.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the reaction steps:

Assuming that the starting material (A) is treated with LiBH4 and then H+. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, so it would reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. If the starting material has a ketone group, it would be reduced to an alcohol.

Similarly, BH3 with H+ may not reduce ketones as effectively as LiBH4, but maybe in certain conditions, it can. Alternatively, perhaps BH3 is used in a different way, like hydroboration, but that would require an alkene.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material's ketone remains, but some other group is being reduced.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the reducing agents are reducing the ester to an alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization.

Wait, another approach: the product is a cyclic ketone, which suggests that the starting material might have a carbonyl group that, upon reduction and cyclization, forms the ring.

Wait, but if the starting material is a β-keto acid, decarboxylation would form a ketone. But how does that form a ring? Decarboxylation would typically release CO2 and form a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyran ring.

Wait, I'm not making progress here. Let me think about the stereochemistry. The product from A is (R)-4-ethyl, and from B is (S)-4-ethyl. So the configuration depends on the starting material's configuration and the reaction's stereoselectivity.

Assuming that the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol forms a new chiral center. So if the starting material's configuration is R, then under certain conditions, it might form R or S in the product.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic hemiacetal? Or is it that the starting material's ester is reduced, forming a diol, which then forms the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has an ester group which, upon reduction, becomes a diol. Then, the diol can undergo cyclization to form the pyran ring.

Wait, if the starting material is an ester like R-O-CO-R', then reduction with LiBH4 would reduce the ester to a diol. Because LiBH4 can reduce esters to glycols. For example, esters are reduced to glycols via two successive reductions: the ester to aldehyde, then to alcohol, but wait, no, I think LiBH4 would reduce esters to alcohols. Wait, no, esters are typically reduced to alcohols via two steps: first, the ester is reduced to an aldehyde, then the aldehyde is reduced to a primary alcohol. Wait, no, that's with LiAlH4. Alternatively, perhaps LiBH4 cannot reduce esters, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has both a ketone and an ester group, and the reductant selectively reduces one of them.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so the ketone in the starting material remains. So the other group (ester) must have been modified.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester. When LiBH4 is used, it might reduce the ester to a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyran ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and upon reduction, the ester is converted into a diol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the ring.

Wait, let's model this. Suppose the starting material is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-OCH2CH(CH3)2)

But that's getting too complex. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is:

O
||
O-CO-OCH2CH(CH3)2

But that's probably not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester: R-CO-CO-O-R'.

Wait, but that's a diketone and an ester, which might be unstable.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester where the keto group is on the same carbon as the ester.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think about the options given.

Looking at the options, each pair (A and B) are either R or S configurations for the same compound. For example, option D has A as R and B as S.

So, the starting materials A and B are enantiomers of each other. Because treating each with different reagents gives products that are enantiomers.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the two reagents (LiBH4 and BH3) would induce opposite configurations in the product if the starting materials are enantiomers.

So, the reaction's stereochemistry depends on the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent's action.

Wait, but what's the role of the reducing agent in determining the stereochemistry? LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and BH3 is a milder one, possibly leading to different configurations.

Wait, in the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, the stereochemistry of the resulting alcohol depends on the mechanism. For example, in the reduction of a ketone to a secondary alcohol, the nucleophile (BH4- or H- from BH3) attacks the carbonyl carbon. The approach of the nucleophile determines the configuration.

But wait, BH3 without a catalyst doesn't typically reduce ketones. Wait, perhaps the problem is using BH3 in a different way. Or perhaps it's a typo, and one of the reagents is actually BH3•THF, which is a common reducing agent for ketones.

Alternatively, perhaps in the presence of H+, BH3 is protonating something else.

But assuming that both reagents are used to reduce the same carbonyl group in the starting material, but with different stereochemical outcomes.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and the reduction forms a secondary alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the ring. The configuration of the starting material's chiral center would influence the configuration of the product.

Wait, if the starting material is (R) configuration, and the reduction leads to inversion or retention, then the product would have a specific configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's configuration dictates the face from which the nucleophile attacks, leading to the product's configuration.

Wait, for the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol using LiBH4 or BH3, the mechanism is typically an acid-catalyzed addition of the borohydride. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure.

In the reduction of ketones, the borohydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the hydride comes from the borane. The stereochemistry depends on whether the approach is from the same face or opposite face.

Wait, in the case of ketones, the reduction with BH3 (or other borane-based reagents) typically leads to the formation of the alcohol with retention of configuration, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a specific stereocenter based on the starting material's configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a chiral center that, upon reduction, leads to the product's configuration.

Assuming that the starting material's configuration is R, the product after reduction would have a certain configuration, and if the starting material is S, the product would be the opposite.

So, if reaction A uses LiBH4 and gives (R)-product, and reaction B uses BH3 and gives (S)-product, then the starting materials must be enantiomers.

Looking at the options, option D is A = R, B = S. So when A (R) is treated with LiBH4, it gives (R)-product, and when B (S) is treated with BH3, it gives (S)-product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents affect the configuration. For example, LiBH4 leads to R configuration from R starting material, and BH3 leads to S from S starting material.

Wait, but why would different reagents lead to opposite configurations from enantiomeric starting materials?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves some kind of inversion or retention.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an example of anti addition. If the starting material has R configuration, and the reduction leads to the opposite configuration.

But I'm not entirely clear on the specifics. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's configuration dictates the approach of the reducing agent, leading to the product's configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto acid, and the reduction leads to the formation of a diol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyran ring.

But I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for another approach.

The key point is that the two reactions using different reagents yield enantiomers. So the starting materials must be enantiomers of each other, and the reagents cause the configuration to invert or retain in a way that the products are enantiomers.

Looking at the options, the only option where A and B are enantiomers is option D: A is R, B is S.

So then, when A (R) is treated with LiBH4, it gives (R)-product, and when B (S) is treated with BH3, it gives (S)-product.

Wait, but why would the reagents cause the product to have the same configuration as the starting material?

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents cause inversion. So if the starting material is R, the product becomes S, and vice versa.

But in that case, if A is R and treated with LiBH4, the product would be S, and B (S) treated with BH3 would give R.

But the products are given as A → R, B → S.

So that would require that treating R with LiBH4 gives R, and S with BH3 gives S.

Which would suggest that the reagent doesn't change the configuration. So perhaps the configuration is retained.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction proceeds through a planar intermediate, leading to racemization, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the carbonyl group is in a chiral environment, so the approach of the reducing agent leads to a specific configuration.

Wait, another thought: if the starting material's carbonyl is adjacent to a chiral center, then the reduction would form a new chiral center, and the configuration would depend on the starting material's configuration and the reagent's approach.

For example, if the starting material is R, the hydride (from LiBH4 or BH3) attacks from the same face, leading to a specific configuration in the product.

But without knowing the exact mechanism, it's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's configuration determines the product's configuration, and the reagent's strength affects whether the reduction is stereoselective.

But I'm not entirely confident.

So, considering the options and the fact that the products are enantiomers, and the starting materials must be enantiomers, the correct option is D: A=R, B=S.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the correct starting materials (A and B) for two reactions that yield enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reactions use different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The key is to identify how the stereochemistry of the starting materials and the reducing agents influence the stereochemistry of the products.

The products are enantiomers, meaning the starting materials must also be enantiomers to produce opposite configurations when reduced. The starting materials are given as 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which contains a chiral center. The stereochemistry of this chiral center determines the configuration of the product after reduction.

LiBH4 and BH3 are reducing agents, but their stereochemical outcomes depend on the starting material's configuration. If the starting material is (R), it will produce the (R)-product when reduced, and if the starting material is (S), it will produce the (S)-product. Therefore, the starting materials must be enantiomers to yield the enantiomeric products.

Among the options provided, only option D pairs the starting materials as enantiomers: A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This ensures that the reaction with LiBH4 produces the (R)-product from the (R)-starting material and the reaction with BH3 produces the (S)-product from the (S)-starting material.

Answer: D
