Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. 

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle. The formula I think I need is the mean proper lifetime, which is the inverse of the decay rate. But wait, the decay rate Γ is related to the width. Oh right, the total decay width Γ is connected to the lifetime τ by τ = ħ / Γ. And ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

So the first step is to find the lifetime τ. But wait, the production energy E is given, and the mass m is also provided. How does that fit in? Oh, maybe I need to calculate the velocity of the meson because the mean decay distance depends on how fast the particle is moving before it decays.

Right, because the lab frame is different from the rest frame. The decay length is the particle's speed multiplied by its lifetime. So the formula for mean decay distance L is L = v * τ. But I need to calculate v in terms of the given energy.

Wait, the meson is produced with energy E. Since E is much larger than its rest mass (E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV), the meson is ultra-relativistic. So I can approximate the energy as E ≈ pc, where p is the momentum. So the energy E = 8 GeV, so p ≈ E/c. But wait, let me get the exact relation.

The energy-momentum relation for a relativistic particle is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. Since E is 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV, let's compute E/(m c^2). 8 / 1.2 is about 6.666..., so E is about 6.667 times m c^2. So E is significantly larger than m c^2, so the approximation E ≈ pc is reasonable here. So p ≈ E/(c^2) * c? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, E is in GeV, but units might be a bit messy. Let me think in natural units where c=1. So E^2 = p^2 + m^2. So p ≈ E when E >> m. So yeah, in natural units, p ≈ E. But when converting back to real units, I have to be careful with the factors.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the velocity v of the meson. The velocity can be found using the relativistic equations.

The relativistic energy is E = γ m c^2. The momentum is p = γ m v. The relation between E and p is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So solving for v. Let me write the expression in terms of v. We have γ = E / (m c^2). Also, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

So, γ = E/(m c²) → let's compute that. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So E/(m c²) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So γ is about 6.6667.

Then, γ = 1/sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2 ) → 6.6667 = 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Let me square both sides: (6.6667)^2 = 1/(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute 6.6667 squared: 6.6667^2 ≈ (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.444.

So 44.444 = 1/(1 - v²/c²) → 1 - v²/c² = 1/44.444 ≈ 0.0225 → v²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775 → v/c ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

Wow, that's a high velocity. So approximately 0.9887 times the speed of light. I'll keep that in mind.

Now, the decay width Γ is given as 320 MeV. I remember that the decay width is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ → τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, Planck's constant ħ is h/(2π), and in natural units (where ħ c = 197.3 MeV·fm, I think), but maybe I should compute it in standard units.

Let me get the value of ħ. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, and 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, but perhaps I can just use units where ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So Γ is given in MeV, which is 1e-3 GeV. So Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.

Compute 6.582 / 0.32: 6.582 ÷ 0.32 ≈ 20.56875 → so τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, that's a very short lifetime. But particles with larger Γ have shorter lifetimes, and since Γ is 320 MeV, which is quite large, so yeah, the lifetime is very short.

But wait, that's the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the meson's rest frame). But the decay distance is measured in the lab frame, so we need to account for time dilation.

The proper lifetime is τ, and the lifetime in the lab frame is γ τ, because the meson is moving at a high velocity, so it experiences time slower in our frame.

Wait no, wait. Time dilation says that the moving particle's lifetime is longer in our frame. So the lab frame lifetime is τ_lab = γ τ.

Yes, because from our frame, the particle is moving and its clock runs slower. So for us, the lifetime is longer. So the particle lives longer, and hence can travel a longer distance.

So τ_lab = γ τ. So the lifetime in the lab frame is γ multiplied by the proper lifetime.

Now, the mean decay distance L is the velocity v multiplied by the lifetime in the lab frame τ_lab. So L = v * τ_lab.

Putting it all together:

L = v * γ τ.

We have v ≈ 0.9887 c, γ ≈ 6.6667, and τ ≈ 2.0569e-24 seconds.

So L = (0.9887 c) * γ * τ.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute γ τ: 6.6667 * 2.0569e-24 s ≈ (6.6667 * 2.0569) e-24 = let's compute 6.6667 *2=13.3334, 6.6667 * 0.0569≈0.380 → total about 13.7134e-24 s.

Wait, 6.6667 * 2.0569e-24 = (6.6667 * 2.0569) * 1e-24.

Compute 6.6667 *2.0569.

Let me compute 6 *2.0569 = 12.3414.

0.6667 *2.0569 ≈ 1.3710.

So total approximately 12.3414 + 1.3710 ≈ 13.7124.

So 13.7124e-24 s is γ τ.

Now, multiply that by v, which is 0.9887 c.

So L = 0.9887 * 13.7124e-24 s * c.

Wait, c is the speed of light. Let's take c as approximately 3e8 m/s.

So let's compute the numbers:

0.9887 *13.7124 ≈ 13.5957.

So L ≈ 13.5957e-24 s * 3e8 m/s.

Multiply 13.5957e-24 by 3e8: (13.5957 *3) * 1e-24+8 → 40.787 * 1e-16.

Wait, 1e-24 * 1e8 = 1e-16.

So 40.787e-16 m → 4.0787e-15 meters.

Wait, but let's compute it more accurately.

Wait, 13.5957e-24 * 3e8 = 13.5957 *3 * 1e-16 → 40.7871 * 1e-16 → 4.07871e-15 m.

Looking at the options, let's see which one is close.

Options are:

A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m

B)4.0655 * 10^-15 m

C)5.0223 * 10^-15 m

D)4.0655 * 10^-16 m.

So my calculation gives approximately 4.0787e-15 m, which is close to option B (4.0655e-15). Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made an approximation in the velocity.

Let me be more precise with v.

Earlier, I approximated v as 0.9887 c. Let me compute that more accurately.

We have γ = 6.6667.

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So 6.6667 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Squaring both sides: 44.4444 = 1/(1 - v²/c²) → 1 - v²/c² = 1/44.4444 ≈ 0.0225 → v²/c² = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775 → v = sqrt(0.9775) * c.

Compute sqrt(0.9775). Let's see, sqrt(0.9775) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt( (9775/10000) ) = approx?

Wait, 0.988^2 = 0.976144; 0.9887^2 = let's compute.

0.9887 * 0.9887: 0.98 * 0.98 is 0.9604. But let me compute it accurately:

0.9887 * 0.9887:

Compute 0.9887^2:

Let me think, (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b², where a=0.98, b=0.0087.

a² = 0.9604.

2ab = 2 * 0.98 * 0.0087 = 1.96 * 0.0087 ≈ 0.017052.

b² = (0.0087)^2 ≈ 0.00007569.

So total a² + 2ab + b² ≈ 0.9604 + 0.017052 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.9775278.

Wait, that's exactly the value we have, 0.9775. So v is 0.9887 c. So my initial approximation was correct.

So v is 0.9887 c. So that part is accurate.

Let me recalculate the product 0.9887 * 13.7124.

Wait no, wait. The product was 0.9887 * (13.7124e-24 s * 3e8 m/s).

Wait, perhaps I should break it down more.

Wait, 13.7124e-24 s comes from γ τ, which is 6.6667 * τ. And τ is ħ / Γ.

Wait, perhaps I should redo the calculation of τ.

Wait, τ = ħ / Γ. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV s.

Γ is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.

6.582 / 0.32: Let's compute that.

0.32 * 20 = 6.4, so 6.582 is 0.182 more than 6.4. So 0.182 / 0.32 = 0.56875.

So 20 + 0.56875 = 20.56875 → τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s.

Correct. So γ τ is 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

6.6667 *2.056875 = ?

Let's compute 6 *2.056875 =12.34125.

0.6667 * 2.056875 ≈ 1.3710.

Total 13.71225e-24 s.

So L = v * γ τ * c.

Wait, no. Wait, L = v * (γ τ) → v is in terms of c.

Wait, v is 0.9887 c. So L = (0.9887 c) * (γ τ) → (0.9887 c) * (γ τ).

But c is in m/s, and τ is in seconds. So it's meters.

Let me compute:

γ τ = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 13.712e-24 s.

Multiply by v: 0.9887 c → 0.9887 *3e8 m/s → 2.9661e8 m/s.

So L = (13.712e-24 s) * (2.9661e8 m/s) → 13.712e-24 * 2.9661e8.

Compute 13.712 * 2.9661 ≈ let's see:

13 *3 =39.

0.712 *3=2.136 → 39+2.136=41.136.

But wait, 2.9661 is just under 3, so perhaps 13.712 * 2.9661 ≈ 40.68.

Wait, more accurately:

2.9661 *13.712:

Let me compute 13.712 * 3 =41.136, but since it's 2.9661, which is 3 -0.0339.

So 13.712 * 3 =41.136.

Subtract 13.712 * 0.0339 → 0.4657.

So 41.136 - 0.4657 ≈40.6703.

So 40.6703e-24 +8 → 40.6703e-16 → 4.06703e-15 meters.

So approximately 4.067e-15 m.

Looking back at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.

So the correct answer must be option B.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation steps for any possible miscalculations.

Wait, let me recompute the product 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s.

6.6667 *2.056875 = let's compute 6.6667 *2 =13.3334.

6.6667 *0.056875 = ?

0.05 is 0.05, 0.006875 is 0.006875.

6.6667 *0.05 = 0.333335.

6.6667 *0.006875 = approximately 0.045833.

So sum: 0.333335 + 0.045833 = 0.379168.

So total 13.3334 + 0.379168 =13.712568e-24 s.

Then, L = v * (γ τ) = (0.9887 c) * (13.712568e-24 s).

But c is 3e8 m/s.

So (0.9887 *3e8 m/s) * (13.712568e-24 s) → (2.9661e8 m/s) * (13.712568e-24 s) = 2.9661e8 *13.712568e-24 m.

Multiply 2.9661e8 by 13.712568e-24:

2.9661 * 13.712568 ≈ let's compute.

2 *13.712568=27.425136.

0.9661 *13.712568 ≈ let's do 0.9 *13.712568=12.3413112, 0.0661 *13.712568≈0.9062. So total 12.3413 +0.9062=13.2475. So 27.425136 +13.2475 ≈40.6726.

So 40.6726e-16 m → 4.06726e-15 m.

So that's about 4.067e-15 m, which aligns with option B (4.0655e-15 m).

Hence, the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the relationship \( L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}} \), where \( v \) is the velocity of the meson and \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \) is the lifetime in the lab frame. The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by \( \tau = \hbar / \Gamma \), and \( \tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau \), where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor.

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The decay width is \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \), and the reduced Planck constant is \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \). Thus,  
\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s}}{0.32 \, \text{GeV}} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The production energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and the mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Using the relativistic relation \( \gamma = E / (m c^2) \),  
\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the lab-frame lifetime \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \)
The lab-frame lifetime is \( \tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau \). Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \) and \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \),  
\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 13.712568 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the velocity \( v \)
The velocity \( v \) is determined from \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Solving for \( v \),  
\[
v = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \cdot c.
\]
For \( \gamma = 6.6667 \),  
\[
v = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} \cdot c = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} \cdot c = \sqrt{0.9775} \cdot c \approx 0.9887 \cdot c.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is \( L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}} \). Substituting \( v = 0.9887 \cdot c \), \( \tau_{\text{lab}} = 13.712568 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \), and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),  
\[
L = (0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8) \cdot (13.712568 \times 10^{-24}) = 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Final Answer
The calculated mean decay distance \( L \) is approximately \( 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which matches option **B** (\( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)).

Answer: B
