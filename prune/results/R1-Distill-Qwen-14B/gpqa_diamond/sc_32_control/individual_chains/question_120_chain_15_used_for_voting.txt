Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different power dependencies on 1/plx.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is plx (in parsecs) equals 1 divided by distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/d. That means the larger the parallax, the closer the star is because a closer star will have a larger parallax shift.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So, if I think about the distribution, more stars are probably found at larger distances because there are more galaxies and stars as you look further out, but wait, no. Wait, in reality, the number of stars you can see increases with distance up to a point, but in this question, it's assuming stars are uniformly distributed. Oh right, uniform distribution simplifies things.

If the stars are uniformly distributed, that means the same number of stars per unit volume in space. So the density is uniform, right? So how does that translate to parallax?

Let me think about the relation between distance and parallax. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So as plx increases, distance decreases. So a small plx means a more distant star.

Now, the number of stars per unit parallax interval. Let's denote N as the number of stars per unit plx (say, per parsec of parallax). I need to find how N scales with plx.

In a uniform distribution, the number of stars depends on the volume of space you're considering. The volume element in spherical coordinates is (4π r² dr). But wait, since we're dealing with parallax, which is 1/d, maybe I should express everything in terms of plx.

Let's consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd. The volume of this shell is 4π d² dd. The number of stars in this shell would be the volume multiplied by the number density (n), which is uniform. So stars_in_shell = n * 4π d² dd.

But the parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let's substitute that in. So stars_in_shell = n * 4π (1/plx)² * (dd). Now, since plx = 1/d, then dd = - (1/(plx²)) d plx. Wait, because d=1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx). The negative sign would account for the direction, but since we're dealing with magnitudes, maybe we can ignore the negative sign and just take the absolute value.

So substituting, we get stars_in_shell = n * 4π (1/plx²) * ( - (1/plx²) d plx ). Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me try another approach.

We have the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx. The corresponding distances are d = 1/plx and d + dd = 1/(plx + dplx). Hmm, perhaps it's easier to express everything in terms of plx.

The volume between plx and plx + dplx is the difference in the volumes of the two spheres. Wait no, wait, no. Because the parallax is 1/d, so when plx increases, d decreases.

Wait, perhaps I should express the volume in terms of plx. The volume of a sphere with radius d is (4/3)π d³. So to find the number of stars in a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx, the volume is 4π d² dd. Since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (d plx) / (plx²). Since plx increases as d decreases, but I'm looking for a positive change, maybe I should think in terms of d plx. Let me not get too bogged down with signs—focus on the scaling.

So, stars_in_shell = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd), but dd is the change in distance. Since d = 1/plx, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. So substituting, stars_in_shell = n * 4π (1/plx²) * ( - (1/plx²) d plx ). The negative indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but the magnitude is what's important here.

So stars_in_shell = n * 4π (1/plx^4) * d plx. Wait, that can't be right. Because the number of stars per unit plx would then be (stars_in_shell)/(d plx) ) = n * 4π (1/plx^4). So the number of stars per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx^4. That would be option A.

Wait, but another approach: the number of stars in a range of parallaxes from plx to plx + dplx would be the number density times the volume between those distances. Let me think about the volume for a given plx.

The volume between parallax plx and plx + dplx is the volume of the sphere at distance d=1/plx, with thickness dd. Wait, maybe I should express this in terms of plx.

Wait, for a given plx, the distance is d = 1/plx. So, the stars in a thin shell of thickness dd at distance d would have a volume 4π d² dd. Now, if I change variables from d to plx, then since d = 1/plx, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. So the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx^2) d plx ). The negative just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but the magnitude is 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number of stars in this shell is n * 4π (1/plx^4) d plx. Therefore, the number of stars per unit plx is (n * 4π) * (1/plx^4) ) per d plx. So the number density as a function of plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that seems like a steep falloff. So for a given range of plx, the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^4. So that would mean as plx increases (closer stars), the number of stars per unit plx decreases, which makes sense because higher plx (closer stars) would mean fewer stars in that range.

Wait, but wait another moment. I'm considering a uniform distribution in 3D space. So the number of stars in a shell is proportional to the surface area (4π d²) times the thickness (dd). But when expressing that in terms of plx, since d is 1/plx, the surface area becomes 4π (1/plx)^2. The thickness dd is related to d plx via the derivative: dd = - (1/plx^2) d plx. So the volume element in terms of plx is (4π (1/plx)^2 ) * ( - (1/plx^2) d plx ) ) = 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number of stars in a d plx interval is n * 4π (1/plx^4) d plx. So the number per unit plx (d plx) is n * 4π (1/plx^4). So the number decreases as plx increases, which makes sense because higher plx corresponds to closer stars, which are less dense in the volume per unit plx.

Wait, but wait: the question says, "number of stars per unit range of plx". So if plx increases by d plx, the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^4. So N ∝ 1/plx^4. Looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I was under the impression that the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^3. Why?

Perhaps going back: the number density is uniform in space. So the number of stars per unit volume is a constant, n.

The volume between plx and plx + d plx is the volume at distance d=1/plx, and thickness dd. So Volume = 4π d² dd.

Expressed in terms of plx: d=1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. So Volume = 4π (1/plx^2) * ( - (1/plx²) d plx ) ) = 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So N = n * Volume = n * 4π (1/plx^4) d plx. So the number per unit plx (d plx) is n*4π (1/plx^4). So the number per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx^4. So answer A.

But wait, wait another thought. The confusion arises because sometimes the question is about the number per unit volume, but in this case, it's about per unit plx. So perhaps I'm correct with A.

Alternatively, another approach: the number of stars in a given distance interval (d to d + dd) is proportional to the surface area at that distance, which is 4πd² * dd. Since d = 1/plx, then d² = 1/plx². So the number of stars is proportional to (1/plx²) * dd.

But how does this relate to plx? Since dd = (dd/d plx) * d plx, and d plx is the change in parallax. So dd = (d (1/plx)) ) / d plx ) → wait, d is 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) d plx.

Wait, again, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. So the number of stars in a d plx interval is n * 4π (1/plx²) * ( -1/plx² d plx ) ) → which is n *4π (1/plx^4 ) d plx.

So the number per unit plx is n*4π / plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but sometimes I've read that the number of stars as a function of distance (n ∝ 1/d^2) because the volume element scales with d² * dd, but here we're looking at parallax, which is 1/d. So the dependence might be different.

Wait, let me think again. If the number of stars per unit volume is n, and I'm looking for stars in a thin shell at distance d, the number is n * 4π d² dd. So if I want the number per unit change in parallax, I need to express dd in terms of d plx.

Since d = 1/plx, dd = (d (plx))^{-1} d plx → Wait, no. Let me calculate dd in terms of d plx.

d = 1/plx → plx =1/d → So d plx = d (1/d^2) ) → d plx = 1/(d²) → So dd = - (1/(d²)) d plx.

Because when plx increases by d plx, d decreases by (d plx)/(d²) → dd = - (1/d²) d plx.

So substituting back into the number of stars:

N = n * 4π d² * dd → n *4π d² * ( - 1/d² d plx ) → simplifies to n *4π (-d plx ). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if I do that, then N = n *4π (-d plx ). But d is 1/plx, so substituting, N = n *4π (- (1/plx) d plx ). So the number of stars in a d plx interval is proportional to (1/plx) * d plx. Which would imply that N is proportional to 1/plx.

Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So now I'm confused. Where did I go wrong?

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the substitution. Let's re-express.

We have:

N = n * 4π d² dd.

We want N per d plx. So express dd in terms of d plx.

d = 1/plx → So dd = d (plxx) → No, more accurately, d plx is the change in plx, and we can express dd as the change in d, which is - (1/(plx² )) d plx.

So:

dd = - (1/(plx² )) d plx.

So substituting into N:

N = n * 4 π d² * (-1/plx²) d plx.

But d=1/plx → d² = 1/plx².

So N = n *4π (1/plx²) * (-1/plx²) d plx → which is n*4π (-1/plx^4) d plx.

So N is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but this brings me back to the initial conclusion—so why the confusion earlier?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake when I thought the number was proportional to 1/plx, which would have been option C. But that was a miscalculation.

So the correct scaling is 1/plx^4. So the answer is A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely related to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance to the star. The question assumes a uniform distribution of stars in space, meaning the number density of stars (\( n \)) is constant.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell and the number density of stars: 

\[
\text{Stars in shell} = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 \, dd.
\]

To express this in terms of parallax, we use \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), so \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} \) into the expression for the number of stars, we get:

\[
\text{Stars in shell} = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \, d\text{plx}.
\]

Simplifying, the number of stars in a unit range of parallax (\( d\text{plx} \)) is:

\[
\text{Stars per unit plx} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Among the given options, this corresponds to:

**A) \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \)**.
