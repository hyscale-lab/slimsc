Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about selecting the correct reagents for a couple of reactions. The question has two parts, and I need to figure out which option (A, B, C, D) correctly provides reagents A and B for each step.

Alright, let me break it down. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, so for the first reaction, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's a nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, no, but NaCN is a source of cyanide ions, right? So in the first step, butan-2-one (which is a ketone) is reacting with sodium cyanide. I think this is a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group.

But wait, ketones are generally not that reactive towards nucleophilic additions unless they have some activating groups or under certain conditions. Oh right, sometimes they might undergo addition if there's a good leaving group or maybe under specific conditions. But wait, wait, I think that in the presence of an acid catalyst, the carbonyl can be protonated, making it more electrophilic, which would facilitate the nucleophilic attack.

So the reaction is butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and an acid catalyst (like H3O+). The acid would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more positive and more susceptible to attack by the cyanide ion. So the cyanide would add to the carbonyl carbon, and then the oxygen would pick up a proton. But wait, butanone is a ketone, so the product would have the cyanide attached to the carbonyl carbon, and the hydroxyl group as well.

Wait, so butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about the structure. 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be something like (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is four carbons, so the nitrile is on the fourth carbon. Wait, but the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be: the hydroxyl and methyl groups are on the same carbon as the nitrile. Wait, but that can't be because the nitrile would be on a different carbon.

Wait, maybe butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, but that's four carbons in total. Wait, but I think butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a three-carbon compound. So adding a cyanide would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Let me count the carbons: (CH3)2C is two methyl groups on the central carbon, then the OH and CN are attached. So the molecule would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, which is actually an acetonitrile derivative. Wait, but the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, maybe butan-2-one is CH3-CO-CH2-CH3. No, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is acetone, a three-carbon ketone. So adding NaCN and reagent A (which is acidic) leads to the attack on the carbonyl. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, right? But the question says butanenitrile. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the product.

Wait, maybe the product is butanenitrile, which would have four carbons. So perhaps the starting ketone is not butan-2-one but something else. Wait, no, the question says butan-2-one. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, correct. So adding NaCN and an acid (like H3O+) would protonate the carbonyl, then the CN- would attack. The product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But the product name is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So butane is four carbons, but this product has only three carbons from the ketone. So perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH2)2CO, but no, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is three carbons. Oh wait, perhaps the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So butane is four carbons. So the structure would be CH2CH2C(OH)(CH3)CN? Or perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Then that would be four carbons in total. Let me count: the central carbon has two methyl groups and an OH, and the next carbon has the CN. So the structure would be CH2CN-C(OH)(CH3)2. Wait, that would make the nitrile group on the first carbon, with the rest being the ketone part.

Hmm, perhaps the initial reaction is not a direct addition. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution. Wait, no, butanone is a ketone, which doesn't have a good leaving group. So substitution is unlikely. So the first step must be an addition.

So, perhaps the reagent A is an acid, like H3O+. So for the first part, the correct reagent A is H3O+.

Moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So that's a nitrile group attached to a butane chain, with a hydroxyl group and a 4-benzylphenyl group on the same carbon as the hydroxyl. So the structure would be:

Ph-CH2-C6H4-CH2-CH2-C(OH)(something)CN? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, and the 2-position (the second carbon) has a hydroxyl and a 4-benzylphenyl group attached. So the structure is:

Ph-CH2-C6H4-CH(OH)-CH2-CN?

Wait, perhaps I should draw it out mentally. The butanenitrile part is four carbons in a row, with the nitrile on the fourth. The second carbon (the one adjacent to the hydroxyl) has two groups: a hydroxyl and a 4-benzylphenyl group.

So the structure is:

Ph-CH2-C6H4-CH(OH)-CH2-CN? No, wait, but the butanenitrile is four carbons. So:

The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, which would be:

CH2CN-CH(OH)(PhCH2C6H4)-CH2-?

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the structure is:

The chain is: CH2-CH(OH)(PhCH2C6H4)-CH2-CN.

Wait, but butanenitrile has four carbons, so the positions are 1, 2, 3, 4.

But the substituents are on the second carbon. Okay, so the molecule is:

CH2-CH(OH)(PhCH2C6H4)-CH2-CN.

Wait, but in any case, the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is converted into a carboxylic acid.

So how do nitriles get converted into carboxylic acids? I think the typical method is to first hydrolyze the nitrile to an amide, then to a carboxylic acid. But under certain conditions, such as strong acidic conditions with water, perhaps?

Wait, but another possibility is that the nitrile is treated with a strong acid, like HCl, in the presence of water, perhaps under reflux. Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the mechanisms here.

Alternatively, I remember that the hydrolysis of nitriles can be done under acidic or basic conditions. Under strong acidic conditions, like using HCl and heating, the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions, it would hydrolyze to an ammonium salt, which can then be acidified.

So in this case, the reagent B is H2O. Wait, but H2O alone isn't enough; the reaction would require an acid catalyst to facilitate the hydrolysis.

So for the second part, the reagent B is H2O, but perhaps with an acid. Wait, looking at the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

So in the second reaction, the starting material is a nitrile (butanenitrile derivative) which is being converted into a carboxylic acid. So the conditions needed would be acidic hydrolysis.

So the reagent B is H2O, but the options say reagent B is HCl or CH3COOH. Wait, the question says that in the second reaction, the reagent B is H2O. So perhaps that's confusing. Let me read the question again.

Wait, the second reaction is written as:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) --> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, so reagent B is H2O, but perhaps it's being used with another reagent. Or maybe B is the catalyst. Oh, wait, the way the question is written is that the reagents are A and B, which are options given as A, B, C, D. So for the first reaction, the reagents are NaCN and A. For the second, the reagents are B and H2O.

Wait, no, the question says:

butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> product 1

product 1 + B (H2O) ---> product 2.

So the second reaction uses B and H2O as reactants, along with product 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me read again.

The first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product 1.

The second reaction is product 1 + B (H2O) → product 2.

Wait, no, the second reaction is product 1 + B (when H2O is present) → product 2.

Wait, perhaps the B is the catalyst, and the reaction is done in H2O. So in the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is either HCl or another acid, used in the presence of H2O.

Alternatively, perhaps B is HCl, and the reaction is carried out in H2O, leading to the hydrolysis of the nitrile group into a carboxylic acid.

So, for the second reaction, the reagent B must be an acid, like HCl.

So looking back at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl.

Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH.

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl.

Option D: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH.

So for the first reaction, the correct reagent A is H3O+ (since it's an acid catalyst for the nucleophilic addition of cyanide to the ketone). So either options A or B are possibilities for the first part.

Then, the second reaction requires an acid, like HCl, to hydrolyze the nitrile to the carboxylic acid. So in that case, reagent B would be HCl.

Looking at the options, option A has B as HCl, and option C has B as HCl. Wait, option A is A=H3O+ and B=HCl. Option C is A=NaHSO3 and B=HCl.

Wait, but for the second reaction, the starting material is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So it's a nitrile with a hydroxyl group nearby. Wait, perhaps the presence of the hydroxyl group would affect the reaction conditions.

Wait, in the second reaction, the nitrile is being converted to a carboxylic acid. So the hydrolysis conditions would require either strong acid or strong base. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, it suggests that the hydrolysis is done under acidic conditions because carboxylic acids are more stable in acidic environments.

So the reagent B should be an acid, like HCl. So in the options, either A or C have B as HCl.

But looking back at the first reaction, if A is NaHSO3, that would be a different scenario.

Wait, wait, what's the role of reagent A in the first reaction? It's butan-2-one plus NaCN plus A (a reagent) giving the nitrile with a hydroxyl group. So the first step is probably a nucleophilic addition of CN- to the ketone, which requires acid catalysis. So H3O+ as a reagent makes sense for that. So that would make options A or B the possibilities for the first part.

Wait, but in option C, A is NaHSO3. What's that reagent used for? NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is typically used for the reduction of certain groups, like in the hydroboration or in some oxidation reactions. Alternatively, it can act as a mild reducing agent. Wait, but in this case, butanone reacting with NaCN and NaHSO3... I don't recall that as a common reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a point. The first reaction could be a substitution, but as I thought earlier, ketones are not good for substitution. So it's more likely an acid-catalyzed addition.

So for the first part, the reagent A is H3O+.

So looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+.

But wait, what about the second reaction? The nitrile group in product 1 is adjacent to a hydroxyl group. So when converting the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, perhaps acidic conditions would protonate the hydroxyl group, which could make the molecule more stable or facilitate the reaction.

In that case, using HCl (a strong acid) would be appropriate for the hydrolysis, so reagent B is HCl. So for the second part, B is HCl, which is option A or C.

But since in the first part, A is H3O+, so option A has A=H3O+ and B=HCl.

So looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any other possibilities for reagent A in the first reaction?

Alternatively, NaHSO3 could be used as a source of H+ and SO3^2- ions. But I'm not sure how that would help in the addition of CN- to the ketone. I think the addition of CN- to a ketone under acidic conditions is done with H3O+ as the catalyst.

So I'm more confident that the first reagent A is H3O+, and the second reagent B is HCl, which would correspond to option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the correct reagents for two reactions:

1. **Reaction 1**: Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.  
   - Butan-2-one is a ketone, and the reaction involves nucleophilic addition of CN⁻ to the carbonyl group.  
   - Acid catalysis is required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic and facilitating the attack by CN⁻.  
   - Therefore, reagent A must be an acid, such as H₃O⁺.

2. **Reaction 2**: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (in the presence of H₂O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.  
   - This reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.  
   - Acidic conditions are typically required for this transformation, and HCl is a strong acid commonly used for such hydrolysis.  
   - Therefore, reagent B must be HCl.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  - Correct for both reactions. Acid catalysis (H₃O⁺) is needed for the first reaction, and HCl is suitable for the second reaction.  

- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  - Incorrect for the second reaction. While CH₃COOH is an acid, it is not strong enough for efficient nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.  

- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  - Incorrect for the first reaction. NaHSO₃ is not typically used as an acid catalyst for nucleophilic addition to ketones.  

- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  - Incorrect for both reactions. NaHSO₃ is unsuitable for the first reaction, and CH₃COOH is insufficient for the second reaction.  

### Conclusion:
The correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which correspond to **Option A**.
