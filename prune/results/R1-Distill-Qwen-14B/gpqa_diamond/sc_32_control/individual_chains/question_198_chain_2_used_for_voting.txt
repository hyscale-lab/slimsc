Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still learning about coordination complexes and stability constants. But I'll take it step by step.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in a solution. The given data includes the concentrations of Co(II) and SCN- ions, as well as the stability constants for the different complexes.

First, let me parse the information:

- Total cobalt concentration [Co] is 1e-2 M. I think this means the initial concentration of free Co²+ ions is 0.01 M, but maybe I'll have to consider the complexes as well. Hmm, wait, the problem says "total cobalt concentration", which probably includes all species of Co, whether they're free ions or bound in complexes. So the sum of all Co species equals 0.01 M.

- The concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M. That's quite high, which might mean that most of the Co²+ will form complexes with SCN-.

The stability constants (β) are given for four complexes:
β1 = 9 → probably the first complex, maybe [Co(SCN)]+
β2 = 40 → second complex, perhaps [Co(SCN)₂]?
Wait, no, the order might be for different stoichiometries. Wait, nomenclature: the stability constant β_n is for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}, I think. Because each SCN- is -1 charge, so [Co(SCN)_n] would have a charge of (2+) - n*(−1) → 2+n. But wait, perhaps the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n+}? Or maybe the charge is 2+ - n×(−1) = 2+ +n. Hmm, not sure, but I think the main thing is that βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands.

So the complexes are:

n=1: [Co(SCN)]^{+} → charge is 2+ +1*(-1) = +1? Or wait, no, Co²+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN- is -1, so for each SCN-, the complex charge would decrease by 1. So for n=1: [Co(SCN)]^{+} → 2+ - 1*(-1) → 2+ +1-? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me re-calculate: Co²+ has charge +2. Each SCN- contributes -1. So when you have n SCN- attached, the charge of the complex would be +2 -n*(+1)? Wait no, no, wait: when you have a ligand like SCN-, it's acting as a Lewis base, donating a lone pair. So the complex [Co(SCN)] would have a charge of +2 -1 = +1, because each SCN- brings -1 charge. So [Co(SCN)]+^ would be correct for n=1.

Similarly, for n=2, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, because 2 - 2 = 0. For n=3, [Co(SCN)_3]^- (2 -3= -1), and for n=4, [Co(SCN)_4]^2- (2-4= -2).

Wait, but that's probably not important right now. The key is the stability constants, which determine which complexes are more likely to form.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think the blue ones are the [Co(SCN)_2] complexes. So that's the n=2 complex. So the problem is asking: what's the percentage of Co in the [Co(SCN)_2] form compared to all Co species.

So I need to calculate the fraction of Co that is in the [Co(SCN)_2] complex.

To do this, I'll model the formation of complexes as a stepwise process. Each step involves adding an SCN- to the previous complex.

The general approach for such problems is to consider the distribution of Co among the various complexes based on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions.

The species present are:

1. Free Co²+: Co²+
2. [Co(SCN)]+ : n=1
3. [Co(SCN)_2]: n=2
4. [Co(SCN)_3]^- : n=3
5. [Co(SCN)_4]^2- : n=4

Each subsequent complex is formed by adding another SCN- to the previous one.

The formation of each complex is governed by the stability constants. The formation constant (β) for each step is given, but I think the overall βn for the complex with n ligands is the product of the stepwise formation constants. Or wait, the βn is the overall stability constant for the entire complex, not stepwise. So for example, β2 would be the constant for [Co(SCN)_2] forming from Co²+ and 2 SCN-.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the cumulative formation constants. So, the overall β for the nth complex is the product of the stepwise constants up to that n.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about whether β1, β2, etc., are the stepwise or overall constants. The question says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Wait, I think the βn here represents the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands. So βn is Kf for the reaction:

Co²+ + n SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n+} with Kf = βn.

But wait, no. The stepwise formation constant is for adding one ligand at a time. So β1 is the constant for adding the first SCN-, β2 is the constant for adding the second, etc. So the overall βn would be the product of these stepwise constants up to n.

Wait, but the problem says each β is the stability constant for each complex. So perhaps β1 is the stability constant for [Co(SCN)]+ (n=1), β2 for [Co(SCN)_2], etc.

But in that case, each βn is the overall stability constant for the nth complex. So to compute the fraction of each species, I think I can model the distribution using the given βn and concentrations of Co²+ and SCN-.

Wait, but the initial approach is to model the distribution using the formation constants. Let me think: the fraction of each complex is determined by their βn values and the concentrations of the ions.

I remember that the fraction of a particular complex can be found using the formula:

f_n = (βn * [SCN-]^n) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β1β2[SCN-]^2 + β1β2β3[SCN-]^3 + ... + β1β2...βn[SCN-]^n )

Wait, no, perhaps I should consider the distribution among all possible complexes. Alternatively, using the formation constants, the fraction of each complex is proportional to (βn * [SCN-]^n), but normalized by the sum of all such terms plus the free ion.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to write the expressions for each species.

Let me denote:

Let’s define the following:

- Let [Co] = total concentration of all Co species = 0.01 M.

But wait, no. The "total cobalt concentration" is the sum of all Co species: [Co²+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2- = 0.01 M.

But the concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M.

The formation of each complex occurs in steps, so the overall stability constants are given as β1, β2, etc., which are the stepwise constants. Or, wait, perhaps each βn is the overall constant for the nth complex. I think that's the case here. So the overall βn is given by Kf for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}.

So for n=1: Kf1 = β1 =9.

For n=2: Kf2 = β2 =40.

Wait, but the overall Kf for [Co(SCN)_2] would be Kf1 * Kf2_step, but I'm not sure if that's how it's given here. Wait, the problem says the "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Hmm, perhaps each βn is the overall stability constant for the nth complex. So for [Co(SCN)_1]^+ (n=1), β1=9.

For [Co(SCN)_2] (n=2), β2=40.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right, because for a complex with more ligands, the stability constant should be larger if each additional ligand makes it more stable. But β3=63 is larger than β2=40, which makes sense. But then β4=16 is smaller than β3, which would imply that the fourth complex is less stable than the third, which could happen if adding the fourth ligand is not favorable. But that's okay.

So, with that, for each n, the formation constant is βn = Kf for [Co(SCN)_n].

The fraction of each complex can be found using the formula:

f_n = (βn [SCN-]^n) / D,

where D is the sum over all possible species of (βk [SCN-]^k ) plus 1 for the free ion.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The formation of each complex is stepwise. So for each n, the [Co(SCN)_n] is formed by the stepwise addition of SCN- to the (n-1) complex.

So the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n] is the product of the stepwise constants up to n. But in this problem, the given βn are the overall constants for each complex.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the stepwise formation constants, K1, K2, K3, K4. Then, the overall K for [Co(SCN)_n] would be K1*K2*K3*...Kn.

But the problem states that β1=9, β2=40, etc., so perhaps βn is the overall constant for the nth complex. So the fraction of each complex is:

f_n = ( [Co(SCN)_n] ) / ([Co²+] + [CoSCN] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4} )

But to find [Co(SCN)_n], we can express it in terms of [Co²+] and the formation constants.

But I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should look for a standard approach to this kind of problem.

I recall that for such a distribution, the fraction of each species is given by:

f_n = (βn [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN]^3 + ... + β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, no. Because each βn is the overall constant for the nth complex, the denominator would be the sum of the (βn [SCN]^n) terms for n=0 to 4, where β0=1 (since n=0 is the free Co²+ ion).

Wait, but in this case, βn is given for n=1 to 4, so perhaps the denominator is: sum_{n=0}^4 (βn [SCN]^n ), where β0=1.

Wait, no. Because for n=0, the species is Co²+, so the term is [Co²+] = [Co²+] = (β0 [SCN]^0 ) / something. Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to consider each complex's contribution as (βn [SCN]^n ), and the denominator is the sum of all such terms plus 1 (for the free ion) multiplied by [Co²+].

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, so perhaps it's better to define the fractions in terms of the following:

The concentration of each complex [Co(SCN)_n] is equal to βn [SCN-]^n [Co²+ ] / (the sum of all possible (βk [SCN-]^k) for k=0 to 4, where β0 =1).

Wait, no, because for each complex [Co(SCN)_n], the formation is:

[Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co²+] [SCN-]^n / (1 + β1 [SCN-] + β1β2 [SCN-]^2 + ... + β1β2β3β4 [SCN-]^4 )

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again: the formation of each complex involves multiple steps. For example, [Co(SCN)_2] is formed in two steps:

First, Co²+ + SCN- → [Co(SCN)]+ with K1=β1.

Then, [Co(SCN)]+ + SCN- → [Co(SCN)_2] with K2=β2.

So the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_2] is K1*K2 = β1*β2.

Wait, but the problem gives β2=40 as the stability constant for [Co(SCN)_2]. So perhaps β2 is the overall constant for that complex, not the stepwise. So in that case, the overall K for [Co(SCN)_2] is β2=40.

Hmm, this is a point of confusion. I think the problem defines βn as the overall stability constant for the nth complex. So each βn is the K for the reaction Co²+ + n SCN- → [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}.

If that's the case, then the fraction of each complex is:

f_n = ( βn [SCN-]^n ) / ( sum_{k=0}^4 βk [SCN-]^k )

But wait, this would imply that β0 is 1, because for k=0, the species is Co²+.

So, the denominator becomes:

β0 [SCN]^0 + β1 [SCN]^1 + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 

But β0 is 1 (since the reaction for n=0 is Co²+ → Co²+, K=1).

So the denominator D is:

1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4

And the fraction f_n of each complex is ( βn [SCN]^n ) / D.

Wait, that makes sense. So for each n, [Co(SCN)_n] = (βn [SCN]^n [Co²+ ] ) / D, where D is the sum of all (βk [SCN]^k )

But wait, the [Co²+] is part of the denominator, but the total [Co] is the sum of all species, which equals [Co²+] + sum_{n=1 to 4} [Co(SCN)_n} = 0.01 M.

But in the expression, the [Co²+] would actually be ( [Co²+] ) = [Co_total] * f_0, where f_0 is (β0 [SCN]^0 ) / D = 1/D.

Wait, perhaps it's more straightforward to model the fractions as:

f_n = (βn [SCN]^n ) / D,

where D = sum_{k=0 to 4} βk [SCN]^k.

Then, the concentration of each species is:

[Co(SCN)_n] = [Co_total] * f_n.

Since [Co_total] is 0.01 M.

So, in our case, f_2 is the fraction that is [Co(SCN)_2], which is the blue dithiocyanato complex.

Our task is to compute f_2.

Given:

β1 =9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

SCN- concentration is 0.1 M.

So let me compute each term in the denominator D.

Compute each term for n=0 to 4.

n=0: β0 * [SCN]^0 = 1 *1 = 1.

n=1: β1 * [SCN]^1 =9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

n=2: β2 * [SCN]^2 =40*(0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4.

n=3: β3 * [SCN]^3 =63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

n=4: β4 * [SCN]^4 =16*(0.1)^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016.

Now, sum these up to get D:

D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = Let me calculate:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9.

1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3.

2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363.

2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.

So D = approx 2.3646.

Now, f_2 is (β2 [SCN]^2 ) / D = (0.4) / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4 / 2.3646.

Let me compute that: 0.4 divided by approximately 2.3646.

0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1690.

Wait, that's about 16.9%, which would correspond to option D) 16.9%.

But wait, I thought the question was about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2, so this would be f_2. So 16.9% is the percentage.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.

Hmm, but wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, wait a minute. The denominator terms:

n=0: 1.

n=1: 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

n=2:40 * (0.1)^2=40 * 0.01=0.4.

n=3:63 * (0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063.

n=4:16 * (0.1)^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016.

Sum: 1 + 0.9 =1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So yes, D=2.3646.

f_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, which is 16.9%, option D.

But wait, the options include option C) 38.1% and B)25.6%, which are higher than this. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the βn being the overall constants. Because when βn is the stepwise constant, the approach is different. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator should be a sum of βn [SCN]^n for n=0 to 4, but in that case, the fractions would be as I calculated.

Wait, let me think again. If the given βn are stepwise constants, then the overall K for [Co(SCN)_n] would be the product of the first n β's. So for [Co(SCN)_2], K = β1 * β2.

Wait, but the problem states that β1=9, β2=40, etc., so I'm getting myself confused. Let me clarify.

If β1 is the first step formation constant (K1) for [Co(SCN)]+,

β2 is the second step (K2) for adding another SCN- to form [Co(SCN)_2],

then the overall K for [Co(SCN)_2] would be K1 * K2 = 9 *40=360.

Similarly, for [Co(SCN)_3], K3=63, so overall K=9*40*63= 22680.

And K4=16, so for [Co(SCN)_4], K=9*40*63*16= 362880.

Wait, but that would make the overall K for n=4 much larger, which would influence the distribution.

But in the problem, the βn are given as the overall constants, not stepwise. So I think my initial approach is correct, and the fractions are as calculated.

But why is the answer so low? Only 16.9% for n=2? Let me think about the log K or the concentrations.

Wait, the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. Let's see the terms in the denominator:

n=0:1 (free Co²+)

n=1:0.9 → which is less than n=0's term.

n=2:0.4 → which is less than n=1's term.

n=3:0.063 → even smaller.

n=4:0.0016 → tiny.

So the sum D is 2.3646, with the largest term being the free Co²+ (n=0:1), followed by n=1 (0.9), then n=2 (0.4), etc.

Wait, wait, but in that case, the free Co²+ is the most significant species, which is 1/(2.3646) ≈ 0.4225 of the total. So [Co²+] is about 42.25% of the total.

Hmm, but that's the free ion. So the complexes are less than 58% of the total.

Wait, but the question is about the [Co(SCN)_2] which is only 0.4/2.3646= 16.9% of the total. So the answer is D.

Wait, but that seems counterintuitive because the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M, which is relatively high. I would expect more complexation.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator.

Wait, n=0:1.

n=1:9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2:40*(0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4.

n=3:63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

n=4:16*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Sum these:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9.

Plus 0.4 → 2.3.

Plus 0.063 → 2.363.

Plus 0.0016 → 2.3646.

So D=2.3646.

Hmm, so the fractions are:

n=0:1/2.3646≈0.4225 → 42.25%

n=1:0.9/2.3646≈0.3808 → 38.08%

n=2:0.4/2.3646≈0.169 → 16.9%

n=3:0.063/2.3646≈0.0266 → 2.66%

n=4:0.0016/2.3646≈0.000676 → 0.0676%

Adding these up:

42.25 +38.08=80.33, +16.9=97.23, +2.66=99.89, +0.0676≈99.95%. So about 99.95% accounted for, which makes sense (the missing 0.05% is due to rounding).

So the fractions are as above.

Wait, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2], so that's 16.9% of the total. So the answer should be D) 16.9%.

But looking back at the options, option D is 16.9%. So that's the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species based on the given stability constants (β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16) and the concentrations of Co²⁺ and SCN⁻ ions.

### Key Information:
- Total cobalt concentration: [Co] = 10⁻² M.
- SCN⁻ concentration: [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.
- Stability constants: β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16.

The fraction of each cobalt species is determined using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{D},
\]

where \(D = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4\).

Here, \(D\) is the sum of contributions from all cobalt species, including the free ion (n = 0). The fraction of the blue dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)₂], n = 2) is \(f_2\).

### Calculation:
1. **Compute each term in \(D\):**
   - \(n = 0\): \(1\).
   - \(n = 1\): \(\beta_1 [\text{SCN}] = 9 \times 0.1 = 0.9\).
   - \(n = 2\): \(\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \times (0.1)^2 = 0.4\).
   - \(n = 3\): \(\beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \times (0.1)^3 = 0.063\).
   - \(n = 4\): \(\beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \times (0.1)^4 = 0.0016\).

2. **Sum the terms to find \(D\):**
   \[
   D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.
   \]

3. **Calculate \(f_2\):**
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{D} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169.
   \]

4. **Convert to percentage:**
   \[
   f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]) among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
