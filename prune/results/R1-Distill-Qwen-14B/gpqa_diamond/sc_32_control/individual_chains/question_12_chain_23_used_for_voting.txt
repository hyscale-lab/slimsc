Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a pion decays. Let's see.

The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). And the pion is stationary. Oh right, when a particle is at rest and it decays, the products must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. So the momentum vectors of the muon and the neutrino should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Wait, but the neutrino is neutral and probably massless? Or does it have a tiny mass? Hmm, I think for the purposes of these problems, sometimes the neutrino is considered massless. So maybe we can neglect its rest mass energy. Let me check the given data. The rest mass of Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's rest mass isn't given, but perhaps it's negligible. So I can treat the neutrino as having zero rest mass. That might simplify things.

So the initial momentum is zero because the pion is at rest. Therefore, the total momentum after decay must also be zero. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So p_mu = -p_nu.

Wait, but if the neutrino has zero mass, its energy is just p*c, right? Because for a massless particle, E = pc. So E_nu = |p_nu| * c.

But for the muon, which has rest mass, its energy E_mu is sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). Since p_mu = p (let's call it p for magnitude) and p_nu is also p, because they have the same magnitude.

So the total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of energies of muon and neutrino.

So, 139.6 MeV = E_mu + E_nu.

E_mu is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ), and E_nu is p c.

So substituting, 139.6 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c.

Hmm, that's an equation with one variable p c. Let me let x = p c. Then the equation becomes:

139.6 = sqrt(x^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + x.

I can rearrange this. Let's subtract x from both sides:

139.6 - x = sqrt(x^2 + 105.7^2 )

Now square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(139.6 - x)^2 = x^2 + 105.7^2.

Expanding the left side:

139.6^2 - 2 * 139.6 x + x^2 = x^2 + 105.7^2.

Simplify: The x^2 terms cancel out.

139.6^2 - 2 * 139.6 x = 105.7^2.

Calculate the squares:

139.6^2 is approximately (140)^2 is 19600, but exact calculation: 139.6 * 139.6. Let me compute:

139.6 * 139.6 = (139 + 0.6)^2 = 139^2 + 2*139*0.6 + 0.6^2.
139^2 is 19321. 2*139*0.6 is 2*83.4=166.8. 0.6^2 is 0.36. So total is 19321 + 166.8 + 0.36 = 19488.16 MeV^2.

105.7^2 is around 11172.49 because 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49, and 2*100*5.7=1140. So 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

So substituting back into the equation, we have:

19488.16 - 2 * 139.6 x = 11172.49.

Subtract 11172.49 from both sides:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 2 * 139.6 x.

Calculate 19488.16 - 11172.49. Let's see, 19488 - 11172 is 8316, and 0.16 - 0.49 is -0.33, so 8315.67.

So 8315.67 = 279.2 x.

Divide both sides by 279.2:

x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that. 279.2 * 29 is 8096.8 (279.2 *30=8376, so 29 is 8096.8). 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87. 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783. So x ≈29.783.

So x is approximately 29.783 MeV. Since x = p c, p = x / c, but in terms of units, since we're working in MeV and c is in natural units (like when using MeV and MeV/c for momentum), perhaps the actual value is 29.783 MeV/c.

Wait, but x is p c, so p = x/c. So perhaps the actual value of p in MeV/c units is 29.783 MeV/c.

Wait, but then E_nu is x, which is 29.783 MeV.

So E_nu is ~29.78 MeV, and E_mu is sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) = let's compute that.

29.78 squared: approx 887.

105.7 squared is 11172.49.

So 887 + 11172.49 = 12059.49. The square root of that is approx sqrt(12059.49) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV. So E_mu + E_nu = 109.81 + 29.78 ≈ 139.59, which matches the pion's rest mass, so that seems correct.

Wait, but wait, the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its energy is that, plus its kinetic energy. So the kinetic energy of the muon would be E_mu - m_mu c^2.

E_mu is 109.81 MeV, m_mu c^2 is 105.7 MeV. So KE_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

Hmm, looking at the options. Let's see:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. That's very close to what I got. So the KE of the muon is about 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's energy is about 29.8 MeV. Wait, but the neutrino's energy is its kinetic energy because its rest mass is zero, so its total energy is just kinetic.

But wait, the question asks for the KE of the product particles. So the options list two values, which are probably the KE of muon and neutrino.

Looking again at the options:

Option A: 2.84, 26.8. Hmm, no.

Option B: 7.2,32.8. No.

Option C:3.52,20.8. No.

Option D:4.12,29.8. That seems to match.

Wait, but wait, in my calculation, the neutrino's energy is ~29.78 MeV, so about 29.8, and the muon's KE is 4.11 MeV, which rounds to 4.12 when considering more precise numbers.

So the answer should be option D, which is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check my calculations again.

Wait, when I computed x, I had x ≈29.783 MeV. So E_nu is 29.783 MeV, which is approximately 29.8 MeV. The muon's KE is E_mu - m_mu c²: 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV, so about 4.11, which is very close to 4.12. So yes, option D.

To determine the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary π⁺ meson into a μ⁺ and a neutrino (ν), we use conservation of energy and momentum. The rest mass of the π⁺ is 139.6 MeV, and the rest mass of the μ⁺ is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino is assumed to be massless.

### Key Equations:
1. **Total Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the π⁺, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the μ⁺ and the neutrino:  
   \[
   139.6 = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}
   \]
   where \(E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(p_\mu c)^2 + (m_\mu c^2)^2}\) (relativistic energy of the μ⁺) and \(E_{\nu} = p_\nu c\) (energy of the neutrino, since it is massless).

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   Since the π⁺ is stationary, the total momentum after decay must be zero. Thus, the magnitudes of the momenta of the μ⁺ and neutrino are equal:  
   \[
   p_\mu = p_\nu = p
   \]

### Solving for \(p\):
Substituting \(E_{\nu} = p c\) and \(E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 c^2 + (m_\mu c^2)^2}\) into the energy conservation equation:  
\[
139.6 = \sqrt{p^2 c^2 + (105.7)^2} + p c
\]
Let \(x = p c\). The equation becomes:  
\[
139.6 = \sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} + x
\]
Rearranging and squaring both sides:  
\[
(139.6 - x)^2 = x^2 + (105.7)^2
\]
Expanding and simplifying:  
\[
139.6^2 - 2(139.6)x = 105.7^2
\]
\[
19488.16 - 279.2x = 11172.49
\]
\[
8315.67 = 279.2x
\]
\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.783 \, \text{MeV}
\]

Thus, \(p c = x \approx 29.783 \, \text{MeV}\).

### Calculating Energies:
1. **Neutrino Energy**:  
   Since \(E_{\nu} = p c\), the neutrino's energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\nu} \approx 29.783 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

2. **Muon Energy**:  
   The μ⁺ energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} = \sqrt{(29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

3. **Muon Kinetic Energy**:  
   The kinetic energy of the μ⁺ is its total energy minus its rest energy:  
   \[
   KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_\mu c^2 = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

### Matching with Options:
The kinetic energy of the μ⁺ is approximately 4.12 MeV (rounded to two decimal places), and the neutrino's energy is approximately 29.8 MeV. These values match **Option D**.
