Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of particle physics and energy calculations. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a pion (Pi+) at rest decays into a muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). The pion's rest mass is given as 139.6 MeV, and the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. I need to figure out the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino from the options provided.

Wait, wait. I think I remember that in particle decays, the conservation laws are key here. Since the pion is at rest, its initial momentum is zero. That means the total momentum of the products after decay must also be zero because momentum is conserved. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

But wait, the neutrino is really light, right? Or maybe massless? Hmm, I think in some models, neutrinos have negligible mass, but I'm not entirely sure. For the sake of this problem, I might have to treat the neutrino as massless because otherwise, the problem could get quite complicated.

So, the pion is at rest, so its total energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. The decay products are the muon and the neutrino. Their energies will be the sum of their rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

Let me think about energy conservation. The total energy before decay (just the pion's rest mass energy) should equal the total energy after decay (sum of the muon's and neutrino's energies).

So, E_total = E_muon + E_neutrino.

E_pion = E_muon + E_nu.

E_pion is 139.6 MeV.

E_muon is its rest mass plus kinetic energy: m_mu*c² + K_mu. Similarly for E_nu: since neutrino's rest mass is negligible, E_nu is just K_nu.

Wait, but the neutrino's rest mass might not be zero, but perhaps in this problem, for simplification, it's considered zero. Because otherwise, the problem could get more complicated. So I'll proceed with that assumption.

So E_pion = (m_mu c² + K_mu) + K_nu.

But wait, the pion's energy is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's rest mass is 105.7. So, 139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu.

So K_mu + K_nu = 139.6 -105.7 = 33.9 MeV.

But wait, that's just the sum. We also have momentum conservation. Since the pion is stationary, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

The momentum of a particle is given by p = gamma * m * v, or alternatively, p = sqrt( (gamma m c)^2 - (m c)^2 ) / c^2 or something like that. Alternatively, for energy, E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

Wait, since the pion is at rest, the total momentum is zero. So the muon's momentum must be equal and opposite to the neutrino's momentum. So p_mu = -p_nu.

But the neutrino's mass is negligible, so E_nu ≈ p_nu c, because for a massless particle, E = pc. Hmm, wait, that's if the particle is massless. But if the neutrino has a rest mass, then E_nu = sqrt( (p_nu c)^2 + (m_nu c²)^2 ). But since the rest mass is very small, perhaps we can approximate E_nu ≈ p_nu c. But I'm not sure; maybe in this problem, the neutrino is considered massless, so we can proceed with that.

So let's proceed under the assumption that the neutrino is massless. So E_nu = p_nu c. And since p_mu = -p_nu, the magnitudes are equal: |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

So, the muon's momentum is p, and its energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). Because for the muon, which has mass, this relation holds.

So, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ), where the energy is in MeV. Similarly, E_nu = p c.

Now, the total energy equation is E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

Substituting E_nu as p c, and E_mu as sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ), we have:

sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c = 139.6.

Let me let x = p c, so the equation becomes sqrt(x^2 + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6.

Hmm, solving for x. Let me rearrange this equation.

sqrt(x² + A²) = B - x, where A = 105.7, B =139.6.

Squaring both sides: x² + A² = (B -x)^2 = B² - 2 B x + x².

Subtract x² from both sides: A² = B² - 2 B x.

So 2 B x = B² - A².

Then x = (B² - A²)/(2 B).

Let me compute B² and A².

B =139.6, so B² = (139.6)^2. Let me calculate that:

139.6 * 139.6.

Let me compute 140^2=19600, subtract (0.4)^2=0.16, and adjust for the cross terms. Alternatively, 139.6 *139.6 = (140 -0.4)^2 =140² - 2*140*0.4 +0.4²=19600 - 112 +0.16=19488.16.

Similarly, A=105.7, so A² = (105.7)^2. Let me compute 100²=10000, 5.7²=32.49, and cross terms 2*100*5.7=1140. So (100+5.7)^2=10000 +1140 +32.49=11172.49.

So, B² = 19488.16, A²=11172.49.

So, B² - A² = 19488.16 -11172.49=8315.67.

Then x = (8315.67)/(2*139.6) = 8315.67/(279.2) ≈ let me compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 * 30 = 8376, but that's a bit higher than 8315.67. So 279.2 *29.75 = let's see: 279.2 * 30=8376, minus 279.2 *0.25=69.8. So 8376-69.8=8306.2. That's very close to 8315.67.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.75 = 8306.2. The actual number is 8315.67. So the difference is 8315.67 -8306.2=9.47.

So, 9.47/279.2 ≈ 0.034.

So, 29.75 + 0.034 ≈29.784.

So x ≈29.784 MeV.

Wait, but x is p c, so p c ≈29.784 MeV.

So E_nu = x =29.784 MeV.

Wait, but that would make E_mu = B - x =139.6 -29.784=109.816 MeV.

Now, the muon's energy is 109.816 MeV. Its rest mass energy is 105.7 MeV, so the kinetic energy would be 109.816 -105.7=4.116 MeV, which is approximately 4.12 MeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's matching.

But wait, the problem is that the neutrino's energy is 29.784, which is about 29.8, and the muon's KE is about 4.12. So option D would be the correct one.

Alternatively, maybe I should double-check my calculations.

Wait, let me recompute B² - A² more accurately.

B =139.6 MeV. B squared:

139.6 *139.6:

Let me compute 139 * 139. 139 *100=13900, 139 *39=5421. So 13900 +5421=19321. Now, plus (0.6)^2 and cross terms for 0.6 in 139.6:

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 139.6^2 as (140 -0.4)^2.

Which is 140² - 2*140*0.4 +0.4²=19600 - 112 + 0.16=19600-112=19488, +0.16=19488.16 MeV².

A=105.7 MeV. A squared is:

105.7 *105.7. Let me compute 100*100=10000, 100*5.7=570, 5.7*5.7=32.49. So (100+5.7)^2=10000 + 2*(100*5.7) +5.7^2=10000 + 1140 +32.49=11172.49 MeV².

So B² - A²=19488.16 -11172.49=8315.67 MeV².

Then, 2*B=2 *139.6=279.2 MeV.

So x=(8315.67)/(279.2) ≈ let me compute 8315.67 ÷279.2.

What's 279.2 * 29=8096.8. 279.2*30=8376.

So 8315.67 is between 29 and 30 times 279.2.

Wait, 29*279.2=8096.8, subtract that from 8315.67: 8315.67 -8096.8=218.87.

Now, 218.87 /279.2 ≈0.783.

So x=29 +0.783=29.783.

So x≈29.783 MeV.

So E_nu=29.783 MeV.

E_mu =139.6 -29.783=109.817 MeV.

The muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so KE_mu=109.817 -105.7=4.117 MeV, which is approximately 4.12 MeV.

So the neutrino's KE is 29.783 MeV, which is about 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 2.84, 26.8 → no.

B) 7.2, 32.8 → no.

C)3.52,20.8 → no.

D)4.12,29.8 → yes.

So the correct answer should be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary pion (Pi⁺) into a muon (mu⁺) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses of the pion and muon are given as 139.6 MeV and 105.7 MeV, respectively. The neutrino is assumed to be massless for simplicity. The goal is to determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino.

### Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy before decay (pion's rest energy) equals the total energy after decay (sum of the muon's and neutrino's energies).  
   \[
   E_{\text{pion}} = E_{\text{muon}} + E_{\text{neutrino}}
   \]
   Substituting the energies:
   \[
   139.6 = (m_{\mu}c^2 + K_{\mu}) + K_{\nu}
   \]
   Since \(m_{\mu}c^2 = 105.7\), we have:
   \[
   K_{\mu} + K_{\nu} = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   The pion is stationary, so the total momentum of the decay products must be zero. Thus:
   \[
   p_{\mu} = -p_{\nu}.
   \]
   The magnitudes of the momenta are equal: \(|p_{\mu}| = |p_{\nu}| = p\).

### Energy-Momentum Relation
For the muon (which has mass), the total energy is:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\mu}c^2)^2}.
\]
For the neutrino (assumed massless), the energy is:
\[
E_{\nu} = pc.
\]
Substituting these into the energy conservation equation:
\[
\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (105.7)^2} + pc = 139.6.
\]
Let \(x = pc\). The equation becomes:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} + x = 139.6.
\]

### Solving for \(x\)
Rearranging:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} = 139.6 - x.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.
\]
Expanding:
\[
x^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x + x^2.
\]
Canceling \(x^2\) and rearranging:
\[
279.2x = 19488.16 - 11172.49,
\]
\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Calculating Energies
1. **Neutrino Energy**:  
   \(E_{\nu} = x = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}\).

2. **Muon Energy**:  
   \(E_{\mu} = 139.6 - 29.78 = 109.82 \, \text{MeV}\).

3. **Muon Kinetic Energy**:  
   \(K_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu}c^2 = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}\).

### Final Answer
The muon's kinetic energy is approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\), and the neutrino's energy is approximately \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.**
