Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and figuring out the energy of the nucleus. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through step by step.

The question says we have a nucleus X, which is lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons. So with 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

We need to find the energy of RHIC when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Oh right, RHIC accelerates heavy ions to high speeds, so relativistic effects are definitely in play here.

I remember that for relativistic speeds, we use the gamma factor. Gamma is equal to 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So v is 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2. Let me calculate that: 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... let me think. Since 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? Because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, because 0.28 times 3.5714 is about 1. So more accurately, maybe 3.57142857... Yeah, 28 into 100 is 28 * 3.5714 = 100. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the energy of the particle in relativity is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m0 * c². But wait, what's the rest mass here? The nucleus is Li-6. So I need the mass of Li-6. I think the atomic mass unit (u) is involved here. Oh, right, I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So first, I need the mass of Li-6 in kilograms or in terms of u.

Wait, the mass of a lithium-6 nucleus. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.941 g/mol. But wait, no, that's the molar mass. The actual mass of a single Li-6 atom is 6 atomic mass units. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The atomic mass unit is defined such that the mass of a carbon-12 atom is exactly 12 u. So each nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 1 u. So a Li-6 nucleus has 6 nucleons, so its mass is approximately 6 u. But wait, actually, the exact mass is a bit less than 6 u because of binding energy, but for this calculation, I think we can approximate it as 6 u, unless told otherwise.

So m0 is 6 u. So converting that to energy: m0 c² is 6 * 931.5 MeV. Let's calculate that. 6 * 931.5 is 5589 MeV. Which is 5.589 GeV. Because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV.

Wait, but wait. The exact mass might be a bit different. Let me check. Oh, maybe I should use the precise atomic mass. Because Li-6 has 3 protons, 3 neutrons, but the actual mass isn't exactly 6 u. I think the exact mass is about 6.012 u or something like that. Oh wait, I think the mass of a lithium-6 nucleus is approximately 6.012 atomic mass units. So perhaps I should use that. Because 6 u would be if each proton and neutron is exactly 1 u, but in reality, they have slight variations, and the nucleus as a whole has a mass less than the sum due to binding energy.

Wait, but for this problem, maybe we can take the mass as 6 u. Or perhaps the exact value is 6.014 u or similar. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the given data. Hmm, but the problem doesn't provide the mass, so perhaps I'm supposed to approximate.

Wait, maybe the actual mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.014 u. Let me think, I think in reality, the mass of a Li-6 atom is about 6.9409 g/mol, but wait, that's the molar mass. So the atomic mass is 6.9409 g/mol divided by Avogadro's number, which gives the mass per atom. So 6.9409 g/mol is 6.9409e-3 kg/mol. Divided by 6.022e23 mol⁻¹ gives the mass per atom. Let me compute that.

6.9409e-3 kg/mol / 6.022e23 atoms/mol ≈ approximately 1.152e-27 kg per atom. Wait, but that's for Li-6 atoms, but a nucleus is different because it's missing the electrons. So the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is the atomic mass minus the mass of the electrons. Wait, but for heavy ions, the electrons' mass is negligible compared to the nucleus mass. So perhaps it's okay to approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the atomic mass in u. Let's find the exact value. The atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.941 g/mol, which is approximately 6.941 / 1000 g per atom, but wait, no, that's the molar mass. So the molar mass is 6.941 g/mol, so the atomic mass is 6.941 u. Wait that can't be right. Oh no, wait, no. Wait, the molar mass is the mass per mole of atoms. So 1 mole is Avogadro's number of atoms. So 6.941 g per mole of Li-6 atoms. So each atom has a mass of 6.941 g/mol / (6.022e23 atoms/mol) ≈ 1.152e-27 kg per atom. But this includes electrons. To get the nucleus, we need to subtract the electrons.

Li-6 has an atomic number of 3, so it has 3 electrons. Each electron has a mass of about 0.00054858 u. So 3 electrons would be 0.0016457 u. So the mass of the Li-6 nucleus would be the atomic mass minus electrons.

Wait the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.9409 u. So the nucleus mass is 6.9409 u minus (3 * 0.00054858 u). Let me compute that. 3 * 0.00054858 is approximately 0.0016457 u. So subtracting from 6.9409 u: 6.9409 - 0.0016457 ≈ 6.93925 u. Wait, that's about 6.93925 u for the nucleus. But that seems high because a proton is about 1.007276 u, neutron about 1.008665 u. So 3 protons and 3 neutrons would sum to 3*(1.007276 + 1.008665) = 3*(2.015941) ≈ 6.0478 u. But the nucleus is only slightly less than that due to binding energy, so about 6.0478 minus (binding energy in mass terms). So maybe around 6 u? But earlier I thought the nucleus mass is about 6.012 u.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps for the purposes of this problem, we can take the mass of the Li-6 nucleus as 6 u. Because when in doubt, the question might expect that approximation. Or perhaps the exact value is provided elsewhere, but since it's not given here, perhaps we proceed with 6 u.

So, let's proceed with m0 = 6 u. So, m0 c² = 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV = 5.589 GeV. Now, gamma is approximately 3.5714, so the total energy E is gamma multiplied by m0 c². So E = 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV.

Let me calculate that. 3 * 5.589 is about 16.767 GeV. 0.5714 * 5.589 is about 3.197 GeV. Wait, 0.5 *5.589 is 2.7945, 0.0714 *5.589 ≈ 0.400. So 2.7945 + 0.400 ≈ 3.1945. So adding to 16.767 gives 16.767 + 3.1945 ≈ 19.9615 GeV. Hmm, that's approximately 19.96 GeV, but wait, the options don't have that. Wait options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

Wait, so none of these match 19.96. Hmm, perhaps I made an error in gamma.

Wait, wait, let's recalculate gamma more accurately. v is 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, as before, so gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. Wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, which is correct. So yes, 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 3.5714.

So E = gamma * m0 c² = 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV. Let's compute that more accurately.

3.5714 * 5.589:

Break it down: 3 *5.589=16.767, 0.5714 *5.589.

Compute 0.5 *5.589 =2.7945, 0.0714*5.589.

Hmm, 5.589 * 0.07 = 0.39123, 5.589 *0.0014=0.0078246. So total 0.39123 + 0.0078246 ≈0.39905.

So 0.5714 is 0.5 + 0.0714, so 2.7945 + 0.39905=3.19355.

Adding to 16.767: 16.767 +3.19355=19.96055 GeV.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the mass.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.014 u? Because maybe I was wrong earlier. Let's recalculate with m0=6.014 u.

So m0 c² = 6.014 * 931.5 MeV = Let's compute that.

6 *931.5 =5589. 0.014 *931.5 =13.041. So total 5589 +13.041=5602.041 MeV →5.602041 GeV.

Then E = 3.5714 *5.602041 GeV.

Compute 3.5714 *5.602041:

Hmm, 3 *5.602041 =16.806123

0.5714 *5.602041:

Calculate 0.5 *5.602041=2.8010205

0.0714 *5.602041≈0.401323.

So 2.8010205 +0.401323=3.2023435.

Add to 16.806123: 16.806123 +3.2023435=20.0084665 GeV.

Still around 20 GeV, but the options are 20.132 (C) or 21.419 (D) or 23.069 (B).

Wait, but perhaps the mass is higher. Let's see. Let me double-check: Li-6 has 3 protons, 3 neutrons. The exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus is about 6.014 u. Wait, I think I saw that before.

But wait, the actual atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.9409 g/mol. So the mass of a single Li-6 atom is 6.9409 g/mol divided by Avogadro's number, which is about 6.9409e-3 kg/mol / 6.022e23 atom/mol = approximately 1.1524e-27 kg per atom.

But an atom has electrons. The atomic number is 3, so 3 electrons. Each electron has a rest mass of about 0.00054858 u. So 3 electrons is 0.0016457 u. So the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass.

Wait, so the atomic mass is 6.9409 u. So nucleus mass is 6.9409 u - (3 * 0.00054858 u) = 6.9409 - 0.0016457 = 6.939254 u.

Wait, that's 6.939254 u, which is way more than 6 u. That's strange. Because a proton is about 1.007 u, so 3 protons would be ~3.021 u. 3 neutrons would be about 3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995 u. So 3 protons and 3 neutrons: 3.021 +3.025995 =6.046995 u. But the nucleus mass is about 6.939254 u? That can't be right. Wait, wait, no, that can't be. Wait, no, no, no, I think I made a mistake here. Because the atomic mass is 6.9409 u. So the nucleus mass is atomic mass minus electrons. So, 6.9409 u - (3 * 0.00054858 u) =6.9409 -0.0016457=6.939254 u. But that's larger than the sum of protons and neutrons, which is ~6.047 u. That doesn't make sense because the nucleus should have a mass less than the sum due to binding energy. So something's wrong here. Did I get the calculation backward?

Wait, wait, I think I mixed up the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.9409 g/mol, which is the same as 6.9409 u. Because 1 g/mol is approximately 1 u. Wait no, that's not correct. Wait, 1 mole of carbon-12 atoms has a mass of 12 g, which is 12 u * Avogadro's number. So 12 g/mol equals 12 u. So 1 g/mol is 1 u. So the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.9409 g/mol, which equals 6.9409 u. So that's the mass of a single Li-6 atom, including electrons. So the nucleus would be that minus the electrons.

Ah, so the nucleus mass is 6.9409 u minus (3 * 0.00054858 u) ≈6.9409 - 0.0016457=6.939254 u. But that's impossible because 3 protons and 3 neutrons add up to about 6.047 u. So the nucleus can't be 6.939 u. Because that would imply more mass than the sum, which isn't possible. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I got the unit wrong. Wait, 1 mole of Li-6 atoms weighs 6.9409 g. So the molar mass is 6.9409 g/mol, which is equal to 6.9409 u per atom. So each Li-6 atom is 6.9409 u. So the nucleus is 6.9409 u minus the electrons' mass.

Hmm, but that would make the nucleus mass about 6.9409 - (3 * 0.00054858) ≈6.939 u. Which is way higher than the sum of protons and neutrons. That doesn't make sense. So I must be doing something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is about 6.014 u. Because I think that's a standard figure. Let me think, the mass of a nucleon is about 1 u, so 6 nucleons would be 6 u, but due to binding energy, the nucleus is a bit lighter. So perhaps the nucleus mass is about 6.000 u minus a little, but that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting the mass wrong.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because sometimes people refer to the mass of the isotope, which includes the electrons. But for the purpose of calculating the rest mass of the nucleus, we need the mass without the electrons.

Alternatively, perhaps in this problem, the mass is given as m = 6 u, so we proceed with that. Let's go back. Let's take m0 =6 u, so m0 c² is 5.589 GeV. Gamma is 3.5714, so E ≈3.5714 *5.589 ≈20 GeV.

But the options don't have 20. Let's look again. Option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, perhaps the exact calculation would be a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is 6.014 u. Let me compute that.

So m0=6.014 u → m0 c²=6.014 *931.5 MeV = Let's compute:

6 *931.5 =5589.

0.014 *931.5 =13.041.

Total 5589 +13.041 =5602.041 MeV →5.602041 GeV.

Then E = gamma * m0 c² =3.5714 *5.602041 GeV.

Compute that precisely:

3.5714 *5.602041.

Let me calculate step by step.

3 *5.602041 =16.806123.

0.5714 *5.602041.

0.5 *5.602041 =2.8010205.

0.0714 *5.602041: Let's compute 5.602041 *0.07 =0.39214287.

Then 5.602041 *0.0014 =0.0078428574.

Adding those: 0.39214287 +0.0078428574 ≈0.3999857.

So 2.8010205 +0.3999857 ≈3.2010062.

Adding to 16.806123: 16.806123 +3.2010062 =20.007129 GeV.

So about 20.007 GeV, which is approximately 20.007 GeV. But the options don't have this exact number. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's a bit higher.

Wait, did I use the right value of gamma? Let me double-check the gamma calculation.

v =0.96c → v² =0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation uses more precise sqrt(0.0784).

Wait, perhaps 0.28 is an approximation. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately.

Well, 0.28 squared is exactly 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma is 3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps the precise calculation uses more decimal places. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, 0.28 is precise, so gamma is 1/0.28 → exactly 3.5714285714... So perhaps using more precise gamma would change the result slightly.

Alternatively, perhaps my approach is incorrect. Maybe I should compute the total energy using relativistic kinetic energy, not including the rest mass? No, because the total energy is gamma times m0 c².

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the rest mass energy as the rest energy of each nucleon, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.014 u. So let me compute m0 c² =6.014 *931.5 MeV.

Wait, 6.014 *931.5 = let's compute:

6 *931.5 =5589.

0.014 *931.5 =13.041.

Total 5589 +13.041 =5602.041 MeV →5.602041 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E = gamma * m0 c² =3.57142857 *5.602041 GeV.

Let me compute this precisely:

3.57142857 *5.602041.

Break it down:

3 *5.602041 =16.806123.

0.57142857 *5.602041.

Compute 0.5 *5.602041 =2.8010205.

0.07142857 *5.602041.

Hmm, 5.602041 *0.07 =0.39214287.

5.602041 *0.00142857 ≈0.007999998.

So 0.39214287 +0.007999998≈0.40014287.

Adding: 2.8010205 +0.40014287≈3.20116337.

Adding to 16.806123 gives 20.00728637 GeV.

Still about 20.007 GeV. So why is option C 20.132 GeV?

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the nucleus is treated as a single particle, and perhaps it's using the mass of a single nucleon times the number of nucleons. Wait, but that's not correct. The nucleus's mass is less than the sum due to binding energy.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is given by the sum of the individual protons and neutrons, but that's not accurate either. Alternatively, perhaps the mass is taken as the average of the atomic mass minus electrons.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.9409 u, which includes the electrons. So to get the nucleus mass, subtract the electrons. Li has 3 electrons, each about 0.00054858 u. So:

Nucleus mass = 6.9409 u - 3 * 0.00054858 u.

3 *0.00054858 =0.00164574 u.

So 6.9409 -0.00164574 =6.93925426 u.

Wait, that's about 6.9393 u. So m0 c² =6.9393 *931.5 MeV.

Compute: 6.9393 *931.5.

Let's compute 6 *931.5 =5589.

0.9393 *931.5 → let's compute that.

0.9*931.5=838.35.

0.0393 *931.5= approximately 36.63495.

So together, 838.35 +36.63495=874.98495.

So total m0 c² is 5589 +874.98495=6463.98495 MeV →6.46398 GeV.

Wait, that's way higher than before. So E = gamma * m0 c² =3.57142857 *6.46398 GeV.

Compute that:

3 *6.46398 =19.39194.

0.57142857 *6.46398.

0.5 *6.46398 =3.23199.

0.07142857 *6.46398≈0.4608.

So 3.23199 +0.4608=3.69279.

Adding to 19.39194: 19.39194 +3.69279=23.08473 GeV.

Hmm, that's close to option B)23.069 GeV. But why is this happening?

Wait, but that can't be right because using the nucleus mass as 6.9393 u is way larger than the sum of protons and neutrons, which is about 6.047 u. But wait, perhaps that's correct because the actual mass includes more than just the nucleons. No, that doesn't make sense. The nucleus should be lighter than the sum of its nucleons because mass is converted into binding energy.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the nucleus mass.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.9409 u. Each Li-6 atom has 3 electrons. Each electron is about 0.00054858 u. So the nucleus mass is 6.9409 u -3 *0.00054858 u.

So 3 *0.00054858 =0.00164574 u. So 6.9409 -0.00164574=6.93925426 u. So that's the nucleus mass.

But that's impossible because 3 protons and 3 neutrons have a combined mass of about 6.047 u. So the nucleus mass being 6.939 u suggests that the nucleus is heavier than the sum of its parts, which contradicts the concept of binding energy.

Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again. Oh wait! Oh no, I think I mixed up the units. Oh! No, the atomic mass is in atomic mass units (u), and each u is about 1.66e-27 kg. So the mass of the nucleus can't be more than the sum of its nucleons. So perhaps there's a miscalculation in how I'm handling the electrons.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the mass of the Li-6 atom includes the electrons, but when considering the nucleus, the electrons' mass is negligible compared to the nucleus. So perhaps I should ignore the electrons. But that doesn't make sense because the electrons' mass is not negligible when calculating the exact value for relativistic speeds.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass of the nucleus as the mass of the atom, which would be incorrect. But perhaps in this problem, the mass is given as 6 u.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with m0 =6 u and see what the options give, but I'm getting about 20 GeV, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the problem is referring to the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Wait, no, the question says the energy of the collider, which is the total energy.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total energy as the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy. But E=gamma m c² is already the total energy, so that's correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 7.014 u. Wait, that can't be right because 7 is the next isotope, Li-7.

Wait, perhaps the correct mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.014 u. Let me see.

Assuming m0 =6.014 u, m0 c²=6.014 *931.5 MeV =5602.041 MeV =5.60204 GeV.

E=gamma * m0 c²=3.57142857 *5.60204 GeV.

Compute that: 3.57142857 *5.60204.

3 *5.60204 =16.80612.

0.57142857 *5.60204.

Compute 0.5 *5.60204=2.80102.

0.07142857 *5.60204≈0.40014.

So 2.80102+0.40014=3.20116.

Total E=16.80612 +3.20116=20.00728 GeV.

Hmm, which is approximately 20.007 GeV. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV, but that's a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in gamma calculation. Let's compute gamma more precisely.

v =0.96c → beta =0.96.

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

But wait, perhaps using exact calculation with more precise square root.

Wait, what's the exact value of sqrt(0.0784)?

Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) with more precision.

We know that 0.28^2=0.0784 exactly. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm. So no mistake there.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the relativistic energy formula, but perhaps the m is the mass of a single nucleon multiplied by the number of nucleons. So m0=6 * (mass of a proton or neutron), but that would be 6 * approx 1 u, so 6 u. Which brings us back to the earlier calculation.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question uses the atomic mass of Li-6 as 6 u, neglecting the electrons.

But as per earlier calculation, that gives E≈20 GeV, which isn't an option. The options are 18.475, 23.069, 20.132, 21.419.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma. Let me think again.

Wait, when beta is 0.96, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2)=1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the rest mass energy as the rest mass of a single proton, but that would make no sense as it's a nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses m = (mass number) * m_p, where m_p is the proton mass. So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the mass would be 6 * m_p. But m_p is about 0.938 GeV/c². So 6 *0.938 =5.628 GeV.

Then E=gamma * m =3.5714 *5.628 GeV= let's compute that.

3 *5.628=16.884.

0.5714 *5.628≈3.212.

Total E=16.884 +3.212=20.096 GeV, which is about 20.1 GeV. Which matches option C)20.132 GeV.

Hmm, that's close. So perhaps the problem is assuming the mass of the nucleus is 6 times the proton mass. Because protons are about 0.938 GeV/c², so 6 *0.938=5.628 GeV.

Then E=gamma * m =3.5714 *5.628 GeV.

Compute accurately:

3.5714 *5.628.

Perhaps compute 3.5714 *5.628.

3 *5.628 =16.884.

0.5714 *5.628.

0.5*5.628=2.814.

0.0714 *5.628≈0.404.

So 2.814 +0.404=3.218.

Total E=16.884 +3.218=20.102 GeV.

Which is about 20.102 GeV, close to option C)20.132 GeV.

But why would the problem use the proton mass instead of the actual nucleus mass? Because in reality, the nucleus has both protons and neutrons, and each neutron has a slightly higher mass than a proton. Hmm, but perhaps for the sake of the problem, they're approximating the mass as 6 * m_p.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem states that the nucleus has 3 neutrons, making it Li-6. So the mass would be 3*(mass of proton + neutron). Let me compute that.

Assuming m_p=0.938 GeV/c², m_n=0.939565 GeV/c².

So each neutron is about 0.939565 GeV.

So Li-6 nucleus: 3*(0.938 +0.939565)=3*(1.877565)=5.632695 GeV.

Then E=gamma * m=3.5714 *5.632695.

Let me compute:

3.5714 *5.632695.

We can break it down:

3 *5.632695 =16.898085.

0.5714 *5.632695.

Compute 0.5*5.632695=2.8163475.

0.0714 *5.632695 ≈0.0714 *5.6327≈0.4033.

So 2.8163475 +0.4033≈3.2196475.

Adding to 16.898085: 16.898085 +3.2196475≈20.11773 GeV.

Which is about 20.118 GeV. The option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps the problem assumes the mass of the nucleus as 3*(m_p + m_n) =3*(0.938 +0.939565) GeV.

So the correct answer would be around 20.118 GeV, which rounds to 20.118 GeV. Among the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me compute E = gamma * m0 c², where m0 is calculated as 3*(m_p + m_n).

m_p =0.938272 GeV/c² (more precise value).
m_n=0.939565 GeV/c².

So m0 =3*(0.938272 +0.939565) =3*(1.877837)=5.633511 GeV/c².

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E=3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Compute:

3.57142857 *5.633511.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.633511.

Compute 3 *5.633511=16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511.

Compute 0.5 *5.633511=2.8167555.

0.07142857 *5.633511= let's compute 0.07142857 *5.633511.

0.07 *5.633511 =0.39434577.

0.00142857 *5.633511≈0.008033.

So 0.07142857 *5.633511≈0.39434577 +0.008033≈0.40237877.

So 0.5 part is 2.8167555, and 0.07142857 part is 0.40237877.

Adding: 2.8167555 +0.40237877=3.21913427.

So total E=16.900533 +3.21913427=20.119667 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, that's 20.1197 GeV. The option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a more precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the gamma calculation requires more precision. Let me compute gamma with more decimals.

Gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714285714...

Now, compute 3.5714285714 *5.633511.

Let me compute 3.5714285714 *5.633511.

Compute 3.5714285714 *5.633511:

Break it into parts.

3 *5.633511=16.900533.

0.5714285714 *5.633511.

Compute 0.5 *5.633511=2.8167555.

0.0714285714 *5.633511=0.402379.

So 2.8167555 +0.402379=3.2191345.

So total E=16.900533 +3.2191345=20.1196675 GeV.

Which is 20.1196675 GeV, approximately 20.1197 GeV. The option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I should carry more decimal places in the gamma and mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation is:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714.

m0 =3*(m_p + m_n) =3*(0.938272 +0.939565) =3*1.877837=5.633511 GeV.

E =3.5714285714 *5.633511 = ?

Let me compute this using calculator-like steps.

3.5714285714 *5.633511.

Let me compute:

3 *5.633511 =16.900533.

0.5714285714 *5.633511.

Compute 0.5 *5.633511=2.8167555.

0.0714285714 *5.633511=0.402379.

So 2.8167555 +0.402379=3.2191345.

Adding to 16.900533 gives 20.1196675 GeV.

So approximately 20.1196675 GeV. The options have option C as 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher, but perhaps the problem used more precise values for m_p and m_n.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is taken as 6.014 u, which would be 6.014 *931.5 MeV=5.602041 GeV.

Then E=3.57142857 *5.602041 GeV=20.00728 GeV, which is closer to option C if the problem's options are approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the use of the exact formula without approximations, leading to option C.

Given the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the lithium-6 (Li-6) nucleus is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy principles. The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m_0 \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The speed of the nucleus is \( v = 0.96c \). Thus:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy \( m_0 c^2 \)
The nucleus is lithium-6 (Li-6), which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The rest mass of a proton is approximately \( 0.938 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \), and the rest mass of a neutron is approximately \( 0.939565 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Thus, the total rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus is:

\[
m_0 = 3 \times (0.938 + 0.939565) = 3 \times 1.877565 \approx 5.6327 \, \text{GeV}/c^2
\]

The rest energy is:

\[
m_0 c^2 = 5.6327 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
Using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.6327 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:

\[
3 \times 5.6327 = 16.8981, \quad 0.5714 \times 5.6327 \approx 3.2196
\]

Adding these:

\[
E = 16.8981 + 3.2196 = 20.1177 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.1177 \, \text{GeV} \), which is very close to option **C) 20.132 GeV**. The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]

**Answer: C**
