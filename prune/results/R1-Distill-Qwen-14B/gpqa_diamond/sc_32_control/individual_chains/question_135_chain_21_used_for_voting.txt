Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, the question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem gives the Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λ_f fψ̄ f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. Oh, right, it's a Yukawa-like interaction between the boson X and fermions. The term seems to involve the fermion fields ψ_f and the boson X.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So, I need to figure out which fermion-antifermion pairs it can decay into. Kinematically allowed decays depend on the mass of the boson compared to the mass of the fermions involved. Because in decay processes, the rest mass of the decaying particle must be at least twice the mass of each of the decay products, right? Because each product has to have enough energy to be created.

Wait, but what fermions are we considering here? The interaction term involves λ_f, which is probably the coupling strength for each fermion species. The fermions ψ_f could be any of the known particles, like quarks or leptons, depending on what's allowed.

So, for X to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, each fermion's mass must be less than half the mass of X. Because, for a particle of mass M, the decay products must each have mass m less than M/2. So, M_X =6 GeV, so each fermion must be less than 3 GeV.

Wait, but what are the masses of the various fermions? Let me recall:

- Up and down quarks: their masses are very light, around a few MeV. Like, up is ~2 MeV, down ~5 MeV. Definitely less than 3 GeV.

- Strange quark: around 100 MeV, so way below 3 GeV.

- Charm quark: mass is about 1.5 GeV. So 1.5 GeV each. Two of them would sum to 3 GeV. So, X could decay into c c-bar, because 2m_c =3 GeV? Wait, but the X is 6 GeV, so 3 GeV each. Oh wait, no: the mass of X is 6 GeV. So for a decay into a pair, each particle must have m < 6/2 =3 GeV. So any fermion with m <3 GeV can be produced.

So let's list the fermions and their masses:

Leptons:

- Electron: ~0.0005 GeV (511 keV)
- Muon: ~0.1057 GeV (105.7 MeV)
- Tau: ~1.777 GeV

Quarks:

- Up: ~0.002 GeV
- Down: ~0.005 GeV
- Strange: ~0.1 GeV
- Charm: ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom: ~4.1-4.7 GeV (varies, but I think around 4.5 GeV)
- Top: way too heavy, ~173 GeV

So, for X (6 GeV) to decay into a pair, each fermion's mass must be less than 3 GeV. So let's see which fermions fit:

- Lepton pairs: e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-.

Tau is about 1.777 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So tau is allowed.

E and mu are way under, so they're allowed.

Quarks:

u, d, s: all way under 3 GeV.

c: 1.27 GeV.

b quark: around 4.5 GeV. Wait, but that's more than 3 GeV. So for a b quark, 4.5 >3 GeV, so 2m_b would be 9 GeV, which is way above X's 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar because 2*4.5=9 >6. So b quark is out of the question.

t quark is way heavier, so no way.

So which fermion pairs are allowed?

The possible fermions are: e, mu, tau (for leptons), u, d, s, c (quarks).

So the decay products would be any fermion-antifermion pair where the fermion is e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: X→b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

But wait, if b is 4.5 GeV, then 2b would be 9 GeV, which is more than X's 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar. So option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X→c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So c is allowed? Let me check: c is about 1.27 GeV. 2c is 2.54 GeV, which is less than 6. So yes, X can decay into c c-bar.

So option B includes c, which is allowed. But also includes tau, mu, e, etc.

Option C: Includes t, which is way too heavy. So C is out.

Option D: X→b b-bar, others. Again, b is too heavy, so D is wrong.

So the only correct option is B, because it includes c, which is allowed, but not b.

Wait, but wait another thing. The interaction term given: L(y) = -λ_f f ψ̄ f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y).

Wait, the interaction is between X and fermions ψ_f. So which fermions are ψ_f? Are they all possible fermions? Or just a subset?

Wait, the term seems to be for each fermion species f. So the interaction is for all possible fermions. So in the decay, X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the fermion mass is less than 3 GeV.

So the possible decays are any f f-bar where m_f < 3 GeV. So that includes e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So, the possible decay channels are:

e+ e-,

mu+ mu-,

tau+ tau-,

u u-bar,

d d-bar,

s s-bar,

c c-bar.

Looking at the options:

Option B lists all of these except for t t-bar, which isn't possible because t is too heavy.

Option B: c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's all the allowed ones.

Option A includes b, which is not allowed. So the correct answer is B.

To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we analyze the interaction term provided and the masses of possible fermion-antifermion pairs. The interaction term, \(\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda_f f \bar{\psi}_f (y) (v + X(y)) \psi_f(y)\), indicates that \( X \) can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair \((f \bar{f})\) for which the fermion mass \( m_f \) satisfies \( m_f < M_X / 2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses and Decay Allowance:
- **Electron (\(e\))**: \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- **Muon (\(\mu\))**: \( m_\mu \approx 0.1057 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- **Tau (\(\tau\))**: \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- **Up quark (\(u\))**: \( m_u \approx 0.002 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- **Down quark (\(d\))**: \( m_d \approx 0.005 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- **Strange quark (\(s\))**: \( m_s \approx 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- **Charm quark (\(c\))**: \( m_c \approx 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- **Bottom quark (\(b\))**: \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 2m_b > M_X \))
- **Top quark (\(t\))**: \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 2m_t \gg M_X \))

From this, the allowed decays are \( X \rightarrow e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^-, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c} \).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( X \rightarrow b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lists \( X \rightarrow c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( X \rightarrow t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( m_t \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( X \rightarrow b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
