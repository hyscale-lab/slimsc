Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me try to work through this.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's only got dx and dy terms. So this is a 2D spacetime, probably a slice of something higher-dimensional. But the question is about the area of a pseudosphere. Oh wait, a pseudosphere is like a surface of constant negative curvature, right? Or in another context, a surface with an imaginary radius, but I'm not sure here.

Wait, the options have things like 4π(x² + y²), which is reminiscent of a sphere's area, but then there's also plus infinity. Hmm.

First, I think I need to figure out what kind of geometry this metric represents. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So the domain of x² + y² must be less than 4, otherwise the denominator becomes zero or negative, which would make the metric singular or imaginary. So the region allowed is x² + y² < 4. That's a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. But since it's a metric, this might not be flat space.

Wait, the metric can be rewritten as ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r² is x² + y² and θ is the angle. Oh right, because in polar coordinates, dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². So substituting, we get ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So this is a 2D metric, probably with some kind of curvature.

Now, I remember that the area of a surface in polar coordinates is given by the integral over r and θ of the square root of the determinant of the metric. Wait, no, the area element in 2D is sqrt(g_rr g_θθ - g_rθ²) dθ dr. But since the metric is diagonal (g_rθ =0), it's just g_rr * g_θθ dθ dr. So for this metric, the area element would be sqrt(g_rr * g_θθ) dr dθ = sqrt( [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] ) dr dθ. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, the metric components are g_rr = 32/(4 - r²), and g_θθ = (32 r²)/(4 - r²). So the area element dA is sqrt(g_rr * g_θθ) dr dθ = sqrt( [32/(4-r²)] * [32 r²/(4-r²)] ) dr dθ. Let's compute this: sqrt( (32 * 32 r²) / (4 - r²)^2 ) = (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ. So the area element is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

Now, to find the area, integrate this over the allowed region. The limits for r would be from 0 to 2, because when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero. So the integral is from r = 0 to r = 2, and θ from 0 to 2π.

So the area A would be ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Let me compute the inner integral first. Let u = 4 - r², then du = -2r dr. So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r / u ] dr = 32 ∫ (r/u) dr. Let me substitute u = 4 - r², so r dr = -du/2.

Wait, let's make it step by step. The inner integral is ∫ (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2.

Let me set u = 4 - r², then du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes 32 ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [1/(u)] * (-1/2 du) )

Wait, let me change the limits. When r goes from 0 to 2, u goes from 4 to 0. So the integral is from u=4 to u=0. But I can reverse the limits and drop the negative sign.

So 32 * ∫ (from 0 to4) [1/u] (1/2) du = (32 / 2) ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du = 16 [ ln u ] from 0 to 4.

Wait, that's a problem because ln(0) is negative infinity. So this integral would be 16 ( ln4 - ln0 ). But ln0 is negative infinity; so the integral diverges to positive infinity.

Wait, because as r approaches 2, u approaches zero, so the integrand 32 r/(4 - r²) = 32 r / u, which becomes like 32 r / (something approaching zero). But r approaches 2, so 32 *2 / (something approaching zero) → infinity. So the integral diverges, meaning the area is infinite.

So the area of this pseudosphere is infinite. Looking back at the options, option D is +infty. Alternatively, maybe the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2, which in some models might have finite area, but in this case, the integral suggests it's infinite.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the metric is that of a hyperbolic space? Because in hyperbolic geometry, the area can indeed be infinite, especially for a pseudosphere which extends infinitely. So yes, the area would be infinite.

Looking at the options, option D is +infty, so that's the answer.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This is a two-dimensional metric, and the denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) implies that the domain of \(x^2 + y^2\) must be less than 4, corresponding to a circle of radius 2 in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. Rewriting the metric in polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), where \(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), we have:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

The area element in polar coordinates is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{g_{rr} g_{\theta\theta}} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

From the metric, the components are \(g_{rr} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2}\) and \(g_{\theta\theta} = \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2}\). Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2}} \, dr \, d\theta = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

To compute the total area, we integrate \(dA\) over the allowed region, where \(r\) ranges from 0 to 2 (since \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\)) and \(\theta\) ranges from 0 to \(2\pi\):

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, compute the radial integral:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Let \(u = 4 - r^2\), so \(du = -2r \, dr\), or \(-\frac{1}{2} du = r \, dr\). Changing the limits accordingly, when \(r = 0\), \(u = 4\), and when \(r = 2\), \(u = 0\). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_4^0 \frac{32}{u} \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

This evaluates to:

\[
16 \left[\ln u\right]_0^4 = 16 (\ln 4 - \ln 0).
\]

Since \(\ln 0 \to -\infty\), the integral diverges to \(+\infty\). Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**D) \(+\infty\)**.
