Okay, so I've got this question about the Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm. Let's see. The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], right? 

I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable. I remember that in quantum field theory, the renormalizability depends on the dimensions of the coupling constants and the possible divergences in loops.

First, let's figure out the mass dimension of each field and the coupling. The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 because in 4 spacetime dimensions, the action is dimensionless, so each term in the Lagrangian density has to have dimension 4.

So, the fields involved here are ψ (the spinor field), F^{μν}, which is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, probably. And σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless (since they're part of the Clifford algebra). 

Wait, ψ is a spinor, so its mass dimension is 3/2, right? Because in 4D, Dirac fields have dimension 3/2. And F^{μν} is a field strength tensor made from the gauge field A, which has dimension 1. Because A has dimension 1, and F is the derivative of A plus A squared terms, so F has dimension 2, since derivatives have dimension 1. So F^{μν} has mass dimension 2.

Now, let's look at the term: ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let's break down each part. ψ̄ is the adjoint spinor, same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2. σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So ψ̄ σ ψ would have dimension (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Then, multiply by F^{μν}, which is dimension 2. So the entire term is 3 + 2 =5. But the Lagrangian has to be dimension 4. So the product κ multiplied by the term must have dimension 4. So the dimension of κ times (the term's dimension) is 4.

Wait, no, the term itself is part of the Lagrangian. So the term is κ times all the fields, which must have dimension 4. So the term without κ should have dimension 4, so κ must have dimension 4 minus the dimension of the rest.

Wait, no, the Lagrangian density is an integrand, so each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So L = κ ψ̄ σ ψ F must have dimension 4. Let me compute the dimension of ψ̄ σ ψ F.

ψ̄ has dimension 3/2. σ is made from gamma matrices, which are dim 0. So ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2)*2 =3. Then F is dimension 2. So the product is 3+2 =5. So the term κ * (something with dim 5) must have dimension 4. Therefore, κ must have dimension 4 -5 = -1. So [κ]_M = -1.

Wait, but wait, does σ_{μν} affect the dimension? No, because it's made of gamma matrices, which are just constants, so their contribution is dimensionless. So ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension 3, and F is 2, so total for the fields is 5. So κ must be 4-5= -1. So the first part of the question, the mass dimension of κ is -1, which points to options A or C.

Next, renormalizability. A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constant has positive mass dimension. Wait, no, wait. Wait, how does that check out? Wait, because in 4 dimensions, the renormalizability condition is that the coupling constants have non-negative mass dimension. Or is it that the interaction term has dimension <=4? Hmm. Because each term in the Lagrangian has to have dimension 4, so if the coupling has negative dimension, the term would have higher than dimension 4, but wait, that's not correct. Let me think.

Wait, the general rule is that a term in the Lagrangian of the form g φ_1 φ_2 ... φ_n must have mass dimension equal to 4. So the mass dimension of the term is [g] + sum of dimensions of the fields. For the term to be renormalizable, this sum must be <=4. Because if [g] is positive, then the term can be part of a renormalizable theory.

Wait, but wait, the coupling constant's dimension is [g] = 4 - sum of [φ_i]. So for the term to be renormalizable, [g] must be ≥ 0. Because if [g] is negative, then the term would have dimension 4, but in terms of renormalizability, it's about whether the theory has divergences that can be absorbed by the existing terms. So for the interaction term to be renormalizable, the dimension of the coupling must be ≥ 0. Because if the coupling has a negative dimension, the term has higher dimension than 4, which is nonrenormalizable.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of superficial degree of divergence. For a Feynman diagram, the superficial degree of divergence is D = 4L - (N_φ * [φ] + N_g [g]). Wait, maybe a different approach. Let me think of the interaction term.

In this case, the interaction term is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. The dimension of the term is [L] = [κ] + 2*(3/2) + 2 (since F has dimension 2). So [κ] +3 +2= [κ] +5 =4. So [κ] is -1. So, the dimension of the coupling is negative. That suggests that the interaction term is nonrenormalizable because the coupling has negative mass dimension. So the theory would be nonrenormalizable.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: the dimension of the coupling is [κ]=-1. So in terms of renormalizability, couplings with positive dimensions make the interaction renormalizable. Negative dimensions would require an infinite number of counterterms, making the theory nonrenormalizable.

So for this term, since [κ]=-1, which is negative, the interaction is nonrenormalizable. So the theory isn't renormalizable.

So putting it together: κ has dimension -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. Looking at the options, that's option C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$. The fields involved are $\bar{\psi}$ (a spinor field), $F^{\mu\nu}$ (the field strength tensor of electromagnetism), and $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ (a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless).

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The spinor field $\psi$ has mass dimension $\frac{3}{2}$ in 4 spacetime dimensions.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $2$ because it is derived from the gauge field $A_\mu$, which has mass dimension $1$.
- $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, so it does not contribute to the mass dimension.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of the interaction term
The interaction term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must have mass dimension $4$ because the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension $4$ in 4 spacetime dimensions. Breaking it down:
- $\bar{\psi}$ and $\psi$ each have mass dimension $\frac{3}{2}$, so $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi$ has mass dimension $3$.
- $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $2$.
- The total mass dimension of the term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ is $3 + 2 = 5$.

To ensure the Lagrangian term has mass dimension $4$, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must have mass dimension:
\[
[\kappa]_M = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimension. In this case, the coupling constant $\kappa$ has mass dimension $-1$, which is negative. This implies that the interaction term is nonrenormalizable because it introduces higher-dimensional operators that cannot be absorbed into the existing terms of the Lagrangian. Nonrenormalizable theories generally require an infinite number of counterterms to handle divergences.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option **C**.
