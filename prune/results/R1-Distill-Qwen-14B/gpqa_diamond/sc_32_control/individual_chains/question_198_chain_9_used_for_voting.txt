Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. We're given the stability constants (β) for the different cobalt thiocyanato complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Hmm. I remember that stability constants relate to the formation of complexes. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So the complexes with higher β values will form more readily.

Wait, but the problem is asking specifically about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the blue one is probably the [Co(SCN)_2]^n+ complex, maybe the tetrahedral one. But maybe I should think more about the complexes.

So, the possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Because β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. Wait, the β's are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that's a bit confusing because β3 is larger than β2 and β4 is smaller than β2. So maybe the complexes form up to [Co(SCN)_4]^something. Hmm.

But the question is about dithiocyanato complexes, which would be the [Co(SCN)_2] complex. So that's the β2=40 case. So we're looking for the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^n+ in the solution.

I think the approach is to model the distribution of Co(II) in different complexes based on the stability constants and the concentrations of SCN-.

The general approach for such problems is to calculate the fraction of each complex, considering the stability constants and the ligand concentration.

The formula for the fraction f_n of the complex with n ligands is given by:

f_n = (β_n * [SCN]^{n} * [Co_total]) / (1 + sum_{k=1 to 4} (β_k * [SCN]^{k}) )

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the possible complexes:

[Co_total] = [Co] + [CoSCN] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4]

So the fraction of each complex is:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / ( [SCN]^0 β_0 + [SCN]^1 β_1 + [SCN]^2 β_2 + [SCN]^3 β_3 + [SCN]^4 β_4 )

Wait, β_0 is just 1 because it's the free ion, right? Because β is defined as the formation constant from the ion, so β_0 = 1.

Wait, no. Actually, β_n is the formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}, β_n is the equilibrium constant:

β_n = [Co(SCN)_n^{2-n}] / ( [Co^{2+}] [SCN^-]^n )

So, when calculating the fractions, each f_n is the concentration of [Co(SCN)_n^{2-n}] divided by the total [Co_total], which is the sum of all [Co(SCN)_k^{...}].

So the fraction f_n is:

f_n = (β_n [SCN^-]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^4 β_k [SCN^-]^k )

Wait, but when n=0, β_0 is 1 (since [Co^2+] = [Co^2+] / ( [Co^2+] [SCN]^0 ) ), so yes.

Wait, but the given β's are for the first four complexes. So n can be 1,2,3,4 (since β4=16), but wait, [Co(SCN)_4]^2- would have four SCN ligands. Hmm, but the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2.

So, let's compute each term for f_n where n=2.

The problem is that the β's are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So all four complexes are considered. So the denominator will be sum of each β multiplied by [SCN] raised to the power of the number of ligands.

Wait, but [SCN] is 0.1 M. So [SCN] = 0.1 M.

So compute each term:

Term for n=0: β0 [SCN]^0 = 1 * (0.1)^0 = 1.

n=1: β1 [SCN]^1 =9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2: β2 [SCN]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

n=3: β3 [SCN]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

n=4: β4 [SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

Wait, but wait, the term for n=4 is [SCN]^4 multiplied by β4, which is 16, so 16*(0.1^4) = 0.0016.

Wait, but the exponents are 0,1,2,3,4.

So sum all the terms:

Sum = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016.

Let me calculate that.

1 + 0.9 = 1.9.

1.9 +0.4=2.3.

2.3 +0.063=2.363.

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So the denominator is approximately 2.3646.

The numerator for f_2 is β2 [SCN]^2 =0.4.

So f_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4 /2.3646.

Let me compute that.

0.4 divided by 2.3646.

Well, 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169 (because 2.3646 * 0.169 ≈ 0.4).

Wait, let me do the division properly.

2.3646 × 0.169 = ?

Wait, 2.3646 * 0.169.

Let me compute 2 * 0.169 =0.338.

0.3646 * 0.169 ≈ 0.3646 *0.17 ≈ 0.061982.

So total is about 0.338 +0.061982=0.39998, which is about 0.4. So 0.4 /2.3646 ≈ 0.169.

So f_2 ≈ 0.169, which is 16.9% approximately.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.

But wait, wait a minute. The question says "the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species."

Wait, but in our calculation, f_2 is 0.169, which is 16.9%. So the answer would be D) 16.9%. But looking at the options, D is 16.9%.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question mentions 'dithiocyanato complexes'—so that's [Co(SCN)_2]^n+.

But wait, [Co(SCN)_2]^+ has a charge of +1 because Co^2+ plus two SCN^- (each -1) gives 2-2=0? Wait, wait no: Co^2+ plus 2 SCN^-: 2+ + (2*-1)= 0, so neutral. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

Wait, but in the denominator, the terms are βn multiplied by [SCN]^n.

Wait, so β2 is 40, [SCN]^2 is 0.01, so 40 *0.01=0.4. So yes, that's correct.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the denominator. Let me think again.

Wait, when considering the total, each complex is represented by βn [SCN]^n. But wait, the total is sum of βn [SCN]^n for n from 0 to 4.

Wait, but [Co] is the free ion, which is n=0, so β0 is 1, [SCN]^0=1, so term is 1.

But wait, the formula is correct? I think so because each f_n is (βn [SCN]^n) / sum(βk [SCN]^k from k=0 to 4).

So, yes, the calculation seems correct, but the answer is 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but looking again at the options, option C is 38.1%. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, let me recheck the sum:

n=0: 1
n=1: 9*0.1=0.9
n=2:40 *0.01=0.4
n=3:63 *0.001=0.063
n=4:16 *0.0001=0.0016

Add them up: 1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

Yes, correct.

So the fraction f_2 is 0.4 /2.3646≈0.169, which is about 16.9%.

So the correct answer is D) 16.9%.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes the problem might involve more factors, like the actual charge of the complex and its effect on the stability, but I think I've accounted for everything correctly.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the calculation should consider that the higher β complexes are more dominant. Since β3 is 63, which is the highest, the [Co(SCN)_3]^- complex might be more abundant, right? So the fraction f_3 would be 0.063/2.3646≈0.02665, which is about 2.665%. Hmm, but no, f_2 is 16.9%, which is the second highest.

Wait, but in our sum, the largest term is n=0 (1) and n=1 (0.9), then n=2 (0.4), then n=3 (0.063), and n=4 (0.0016). So the highest fraction is n=0 (free Co^2+) at 1/2.3646≈0.423, which is about 42.3% (option A). That's the highest, followed by n=1 at 0.9/2.3646≈0.381, which is 38.1% (option C). Then n=2 is 16.9%, etc.

Wait a second! The question is about the percentage of dithiocyanato complexes, which is the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex, so that's n=2. So the fraction is 0.4/2.3646≈16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, in the options, C is 38.1%. That's the fraction of n=1, which is [CoSCN]+, which is the monothiocyanato complex.

But the question is about dithiocyanato, so the answer is D.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]^0) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (β) and the given concentrations of Co(II) and SCN⁻. The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M, and the SCN⁻ concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants are β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16.

The fraction of each cobalt species is calculated using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{\sum_{k=0}^4 \beta_k [\text{SCN}]^k}
\]

Here, \( \beta_0 = 1 \) (representing the free Co²⁺ ion). The denominator is the sum of all terms \( \beta_k [\text{SCN}]^k \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \), and the numerator corresponds to the specific complex of interest.

### Step 1: Calculate each term in the denominator
- For \( n = 0 \): \( \beta_0 [\text{SCN}]^0 = 1 \times 1 = 1 \)
- For \( n = 1 \): \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}]^1 = 9 \times 0.1 = 0.9 \)
- For \( n = 2 \): \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \times (0.1)^2 = 40 \times 0.01 = 0.4 \)
- For \( n = 3 \): \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \times (0.1)^3 = 63 \times 0.001 = 0.063 \)
- For \( n = 4 \): \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \times (0.1)^4 = 16 \times 0.0001 = 0.0016 \)

### Step 2: Sum the terms in the denominator
\[
\text{Sum} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (\( n = 2 \))
The numerator for \( n = 2 \) is \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 0.4 \). Thus:

\[
f_2 = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

### Step 4: Convert to percentage
\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%
\]

### Conclusion
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is approximately **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.
