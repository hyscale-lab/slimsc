Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on differential geometry, but let me try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor describes the geometry of spacetime. But in this case, it's probably a two-dimensional surface because there's only dx and dy. Oh, right, because it's a metric in two dimensions, so it's a 2D surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Pseudosphere... that's a term I'm a bit fuzzy on. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. The regular sphere has positive curvature, and a pseudosphere has negative curvature, like the shape of a saddle or a Pringle chip.

The metric given looks a lot like some kind of surface of revolution or maybe a hyperbolic space. Let me see. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). If I factor that out, the metric becomes ds² = (32 / (4 - (x² + y²))) (dx² + dy²). Hmm, so 4 is 2 squared, so maybe this is related to the radius 2.

Wait, maybe this is a metric on a 2D surface with a specific curvature. I remember that in 2D, the metric can be written in terms of the Gaussian curvature. The standard form for a metric with constant curvature is something like ds² = (dr² + (a² + (r² a²)) dθ²) / (1 + (a r)^2)^2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think about in isothermal coordinates or something.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute the Gaussian curvature from the given metric. Because if it's a pseudosphere, the Gaussian curvature should be negative. Let me recall that the Gaussian curvature K can be found from the metric. If the metric is conformally flat, as it seems to be (since it's a multiple of dx² + dy²), then the curvature can be computed using the formula involving the logarithm of the conformal factor.

The conformal factor here is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]. So the metric can be written as ds² = e^{2φ} (dx² + dy²), where e^{2φ} = 32/(4 - x² - y²). The Gaussian curvature K is related to the scalar function φ by the equation K = -2 e^{-2φ} Δ φ, where Δ is the flat-space Laplacian.

Let me compute φ first. Since e^{2φ} = 32/(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y². Taking the natural log: 2φ = ln(32/(4 - r²)) = ln(32) - ln(4 - r²). So φ = [ln(32) - ln(4 - r²)] / 2.

Wait, maybe I should compute Δ φ. The Laplacian of φ in 2D is the sum of the second partial derivatives with respect to x and y. So let me compute φ as a function of r: φ(r) = (1/2) ln(32) - (1/2) ln(4 - r²). So the Laplacian in polar coordinates is (1/r) d/dr (r dφ/dr).

Compute dφ/dr: derivative of [ (1/2) ln(32) ] is zero. Then, derivative of -(1/2) ln(4 - r²) is -(1/2) * [ (-2r)/(4 - r²) ) ] = (r) / (4 - r²).

So dφ/dr = [ r ] / (4 - r²).

Then, the Laplacian Δ φ is (1/r) d/dr [ r * (r/(4 - r²)) ) ].

Compute inside the derivative: r * (r/(4 - r²)) ) = r²/(4 - r²).

Take derivative with respect to r:

d/dr [ r²/(4 - r²) ) ] = [ (2r)(4 - r²) ) + r² (2r) ] / (4 - r²)^2

Wait, using the quotient rule: numerator is (2r)(4 - r²) + r² * (2r).

So that's 2r(4 - r²) + 2r³ = 8r - 2r^3 + 2r^3 = 8r.

So the derivative is 8r / (4 - r²)^2.

Then, multiply by (1/r) from the Laplacian formula: (1/r) * [8r / (4 - r²)^2 ] = 8 / (4 - r²)^2.

So Δ φ = 8 / (4 - r²)^2.

Now, putting back into the formula for Gaussian curvature:

K = -2 e^{-2φ} Δ φ.

e^{-2φ} is the inverse of the conformal factor. The conformal factor is 32/(4 - r²), so e^{2φ} = 32/(4 - r²). Thus, e^{-2φ} = (4 - r²)/(32).

So K = -2 * (4 - r²)/(32) * [8/(4 - r²)^2 ].

Let me compute this:

-2 * (4 - r²)/(32) * 8/(4 - r²)^2.

Simplify each part:

(4 - r²) in numerator and (4 - r²)^2 in denominator: so (4 - r²)/( (4 - r^2)^2 ) = 1/(4 - r^2).

So now, -2 * [1/(4 - r^2)] * 8/(32).

Wait, let me compute the constants:

-2 * (8)/(32) * (1/(4 - r²)).

8/32 is 1/4. So:

-2 * (1/4) * (1/(4 - r²)) = (-2/4) * (1/(4 - r²)) )= (-1/2) * (1/(4 - r²)).

So K = - (1/(2(4 - r²))).

Hmm, but wait, K is supposed to be constant for a pseudosphere. Wait, but in this case, it's varying with r. That doesn't make sense because the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in computing the curvature. Let me double-check the Gaussian curvature formula.

Wait, another approach: the Gaussian curvature K for a metric conformally equivalent to the Euclidean metric (which this is, since it's a multiple of dx² + dy²) is given by K = - (1/(2 e^{2φ})) (Δ φ), where φ is the function such that e^{2φ} is the conformal factor.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me check.

Wait, I think the correct formula is K = - (e^{-2φ}) (Δ φ) / 2.

Wait no, perhaps I should have a negative sign.

Wait, let me look it up in my mind. The formula for Gaussian curvature in isothermal coordinates is K = - (e^{-2φ}) (Δ φ), where Δ is the flat Laplacian.

Wait, perhaps I should have K = - (Δ φ) * e^{-2φ}.

Wait, maybe I need to rederive it. The metric is ds² = e^{2φ} (dx² + dy²). The Gaussian curvature can be computed using the formula K = - (1/2) e^{-2φ} (Δ φ), where Δ is the flat Laplacian.

Wait, in the case of a conformally flat metric, Gaussian curvature is K = - (e^{-2φ}) (Δ φ) / 2.

Wait, in my earlier steps, I had K = -2 e^{-2φ} (Δ φ). So if that's the case, perhaps I made a mistake in the factor. Alternatively, perhaps it's K = - (e^{-2φ}) (Δ φ).

Wait, let me review. The standard formula for Gaussian curvature in 2D for a metric g_{ij} = e^{2φ} δ_{ij} is K = - e^{-2φ} Δ φ.

Wait, according to what I remember, the equation is:

K = - e^{-2φ} (Δ φ)

Wait, that seems more likely. So then in my case, K = - e^{-2φ} * (8/(4 - r^2)^2).

So let's compute it again:

e^{-2φ} = (4 - r^2)/32.

So K = - ( (4 - r^2)/32 ) * (8/(4 - r^2)^2 )

Simplify:

The (4 - r^2) in the numerator cancels with one (4 - r^2) in the denominator of the second term. So:

( (4 - r^2) ) / 32 * 8 / (4 - r^2)^2 ) = (8) / [32 (4 - r²) ]

Which simplifies to (8)/(32 (4 - r²)) ) = (1)/(4 (4 - r²)).

Multiply by the negative sign:

K = - 1/(4(4 - r²)).

Hmm, but for a pseudosphere, the Gaussian curvature should be a negative constant. But this expression varies with r. That doesn't make sense. So either I made a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps the metric is of a different type.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that this is not a surface of revolution but a different kind of surface. Alternatively, maybe the area is infinite, and that's why it's a pseudosphere.

Wait, another approach: the area of a pseudosphere. I think the area is infinite. Because a pseudosphere is a surface of infinite extent. For example, a tractricoid (which is the surface formed by rotating a tractrix) has finite area when it's a sphere, but wait, no, the tractricoid actually has finite area, but in higher dimensions, perhaps the pseudosphere is infinite.

But wait, the metric given: when r approaches 2, the denominator (4 - r²) approaches zero. So as r approaches 2, the conformal factor blows up, which suggests that the surface extends infinitely in some way.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, perhaps the radius here refers to something else. Oh, wait! In hyperbolic geometry, the radius of a circle is related to its curvature. The radius of curvature R is related to the Gaussian curvature K by R = 1/|K|. But since K is negative, perhaps it's a different approach.

Wait, in hyperbolic space, the metric can be written in terms of the Poincaré disk model, which has a metric (ds)^2 = (4/(1 - r^2)^2) (dr^2 + r^2 dθ^2), where r is the radial coordinate in the disk. Comparing this to our metric: our metric is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²) = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). The denominator in the Poincaré metric is (1 - r^2), and in ours it's (4 - r^2). So perhaps ours is scaled.

If in the Poincaré disk, the radius is 1, but in our case, the denominator is (4 - r²) = 4(1 - (r²/4)), so perhaps the radius here is 2. Because when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero.

In the Poincaré disk model with radius R, the metric is (4 R²)/(R² - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²). So setting R=2, the metric becomes (4*(2)^2)/( (2)^2 - r² )^2 (dr² + r² dθ²) ) = (16)/( (4 - r²)^2 ) (dr² + r² dθ²).

But our given metric is (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²). Hmm, that's different. So perhaps it's not the Poincaré model.

Alternatively, maybe it's the Beltrami-Klein model. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the area can be computed directly. The area of a surface with metric ds² is given by the integral over the surface of sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor.

The given metric is diagonal, so the determinant is (32/(4 - x^2 - y^2))². Wait, no, because the metric is in 2D, so the determinant is simply the product of the coefficients. Since it's conformally flat, the determinant is (32/(4 - r²))^2. But wait, for a 2D metric, the area element is sqrt(g_{xx} g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2} ) dx dy. Since it's diagonal, g_{xy}=0, so the area element is sqrt(g_{xx} g_{yy}) dx dy = (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy.

So the area would be the integral over all x and y where 4 - x² - y² > 0 (so r² <4, i.e., r <2) of (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy.

Wait, but if the radius is 2, then the region is r <2. So the area is the integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] dx dy.

Let me switch to polar coordinates. So r = sqrt(x² + y²), and the integral becomes:

Area = ∫ (from r=0 to 2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Because dx dy = r dr dθ.

So the integral becomes:

Area = 32 * ∫ (0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (0 to 2) [r / (4 - r²)] dr.

The integral over θ is 2π.

So Area = 32 * 2π ∫ (0 to 2) [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Now compute the integral ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me make substitution u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) = ∫ (-1/2) du/u.

Which is (-1/2) ln|u| + C.

So evaluating from 0 to 2:

At r=2, u=4 - (2)^2 = 0. At r=0, u=4.

So the integral from 0 to 2 is:

[ (-1/2) ln u ] from u=4 to u=0.

Wait, as r approaches 2 from below, u approaches 0 from the positive side. So ln(0) is -infty. So the integral becomes:

(-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ) ] = (-1/2) [ (-infty) - ln4 ) ].

Which is (-1/2) [ -infty - ln4 ] = (-1/2) (-infty) ) = positive infinity.

So the integral ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2 diverges to infinity. Therefore, the area is infinite.

Wait, but that's an integral from 0 to 2. So the area would be 32 * 2π * (integral which is infty). So the area is infinite.

But the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. So if the area is infinite, then the answer is D) +infty.

Wait, but pseudospheres are of infinite extent? I thought they have finite area... Wait, no, I'm getting that mixed up. The tractricoid (which is a pseudosphere) has finite area. Oh wait, that's the case when it's a surface of revolution, but it's still a finite area.

Wait, no, that's when it's the tractrix rotated. Wait, but in our case, perhaps this metric doesn't correspond to a tractricoid, but to something else. Alternatively, perhaps the metric is that of hyperbolic space, which is of infinite area.

Wait, but in my calculation, the area integral diverges. So the area is infinite. So the answer would be D) +infty.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the integral. Let me check again.

The integral is ∫ (r/(4 - r²)) dr from 0 to 2.

When r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, so the integrand becomes large. So the integral is improper at r=2.

Let me compute the integral as a limit:

∫ (0 to a) [r/(4 - r²)] dr, where a approaches 2 from below.

The antiderivative is (-1/2) ln(4 - r²) evaluated from 0 to a:

= (-1/2) [ ln(4 - a²) - ln(4) ]

As a approaches 2, 4 - a² approaches 0, so ln(4 - a²) approaches -infty. So the expression becomes (-1/2) [ (-infty) - ln4 ] = (-1/2)( -infty ) = +infty.

So the integral is indeed divergent. Hence, the area is infinite. Therefore, the correct answer is D) +infty.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This is a conformally flat metric in two dimensions, where the conformal factor is \( e^{2\phi} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \), with \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \). The task is to compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \).

### Step 1: Area of the Surface
The area of a surface with a given metric is computed as:

\[
\text{Area} = \int \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \( \det g \) is the determinant of the metric tensor. For a diagonal metric like the one given, the determinant is simply the product of the diagonal components. Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \), \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \)), the area becomes:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr.
\]

### Step 2: Evaluate the Integral
The integral simplifies to:

\[
\text{Area} = 32 \cdot 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To compute the radial integral, use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), which gives:

\[
\int \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int \frac{1}{u} \, du = -\frac{1}{2} \ln|u| + C.
\]

Evaluating this from \( r = 0 \) to \( r = 2 \):

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \left[\ln(4 - r^2)\right]_0^2.
\]

At \( r = 2 \), \( 4 - r^2 = 0 \), so \( \ln(0) \to -\infty \). Thus:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \left[-\infty - \ln(4)\right] = +\infty.
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion
The integral diverges, meaning the area of the surface is infinite. This is consistent with the fact that the metric describes a surface of infinite extent, akin to hyperbolic space. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is:

\[
\text{Area} = +\infty.
\]

### Final Answer:
The correct option is:

**D) \( +\infty \)**

Answer: D
