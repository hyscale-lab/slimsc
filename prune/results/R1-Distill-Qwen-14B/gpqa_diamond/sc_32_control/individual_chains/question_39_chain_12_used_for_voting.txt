Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that can move along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. When they measured the positions of the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So, all the particles are confined between x=1 and x=3, meaning that's where the wave function is non-zero, right?

Wait, but wave functions in quantum mechanics are probability amplitudes. So the probability of finding a particle in a region is the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over that region. Since all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3, this must mean that the wave function is zero outside this region. So, the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3.

Hmm, the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but the wave function should be zero outside the region where the particle exists. So for x < 1 and x >3, the wave function should be zero. But how does that fit with the given expression? Because the given expression seems to be valid in the region where the particle exists.

Wait, maybe the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i only in the region where x is between 1 and 3. Because outside that, it's zero. So, the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere.

Now, the next thing is that the wave function must be normalized. That is, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1 (since the total probability of finding the particle somewhere is 1).

So, the normalization condition is:

Integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

Let me compute |ψ(x)|². Since ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, the complex conjugate is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5i. Multiplying them together gives:

|ψ(x)|² = (a^2)/(1 + x) + (0.25). Because the imaginary parts might cancel out when multiplied? Wait, let me compute it properly.

Wait, (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i multiplied by (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i is:

(a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (a/sqrt(1+x))(0.5i) - (a/sqrt(1+x))(0.5i) - (0.5i)^2.

Wait, no, that's expansion of (A - B)(A + B) which is A² - B². So A is a/sqrt(1+x), B is 0.5i. So:

A² is (a²)/(1+x), and B² is (0.5i)^2 = (0.25)(i²) = (0.25)(-1) = -0.25.

So, |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) - (-0.25) = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, that's a bit different from what I thought earlier. So the square is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx should equal 1.

So let's compute this integral.

Breaking it into two terms:

Integral (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 + Integral 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

Compute each separately.

First integral: a² ∫ 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

Integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|.

Evaluated from 1 to 3: a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Because ln(4) is 2 ln(2), so 2 ln(2) - ln(2) = ln(2).

So first integral is a² ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 * (3 -1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So we have a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Thus, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Take square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and it is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), where the particle is confined. The normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

First, compute \( |\psi(x)|^2 \). The wave function is complex, so:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + \left(0.5\right)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) \, dx = 1.
\]

Split the integral into two parts:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 1.
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx.
   \]  
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln|1+x| \). Evaluating from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):  
   \[
   a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
   \]

Adding the two results gives:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849 \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), corresponding to option **B**.
