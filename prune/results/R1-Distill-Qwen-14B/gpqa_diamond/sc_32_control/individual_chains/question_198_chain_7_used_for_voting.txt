Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about calculating the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in the solution. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, with concentrations c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, stability constants—those are formation constants, right? They tell us how stable a complex is. Each β represents the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex with a certain number of SCN- ligands.

So, the complexes would be [Co(SCN)]^n- where n is 1, 2, 3, 4. But what's the color for each? The question mentions blue dithiocyanato, so dithiocyanato means two SCN- ligands. So the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2-}, I think. Or maybe it's a different charge? Wait, Co(II) is Co^2+ initially. Each SCN- is -1. For [Co(SCN)_n]^(2 - (n-1))? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, each ligand is neutral? No, SCN- is a -1 charge. So for each SCN, it brings a -1.

So the overall charge for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2+ - n} would be +2 for Co^2+ minus n*(-1) from each SCN. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the formula is [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge}.

Co^2+ has a charge of +2. Each SCN- is -1. So for each SCN attached, you subtract 1. So for n SCN, the complex charge is +2 - n*(+1) — wait no, wait. Let me think. Each SCN- is -1, so when it's a ligand, it contributes -1. So the complex charge is Co^2+ + n*(-1) = 2 - n. So when n=1, charge is +1; n=2, 0; n=3, -1; n=4, -2.

But the question is about dithiocyanato, which is n=2. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, a neutral complex. And it's blue.

The problem is to find the percentage of this [Co(SCN)_2] species among all Co species.

So the approach is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex and sum them to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex.

The formula for each complex is [Co(SCN)_n], and the stability constant β_n is the equilibrium constant for the formation of that complex.

The general approach is to consider all possible species and compute their concentrations based on the stability constants and the initial concentrations.

The initial concentrations are [Co^2+] = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. The total cobalt is the sum of all Co species: Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

Each complex's concentration can be found using the formula [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^n / (1 + sum of all β_i [SCN^-]^i [Co^2+] for i from 0 to 4} )

Wait, maybe more accurately, the fraction f_n of each complex is given by:

f_n = (β_n [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + sum_{i=1 to 4} β_i [SCN^-]^i )

But wait, wait. Let me think about the general expression.

The formation of the complexes is a stepwise process. The overall formation for [Co(SCN)_n] can be considered as:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2 - n}

The stability constant β_n is for the formation of [Co(SCN)_n]^{2 - n} from Co^2+ and n SCN^-.

But in solution, all possible complexes will form, and their concentrations are interdependent.

To find the fraction of each species, we can model this using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions.

The fraction f_n of each complex is given by:

f_n = (β_n [SCN^-]^n [Co^2+]) / (D)

where D is the denominator, the sum over all possible complexes' contributions:

D = [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1 to 4} β_n [SCN^-]^n [Co^2+]

Wait, no. Alternatively, D is the sum over all possible species, including the free Co^2+ and all complexes.

Wait, perhaps more accurately:

The formation of each complex is a stepwise process, but for the purpose of calculating the fractions, we can treat it as a single step.

The general formula is:

[Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n / (1 + sum_{m=1 to 4} β_m [SCN^-]^m [Co^2+] )

Wait, no, because the denominator should account for all possible complexes and the free ion. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting lost in the setup.

Another approach is to consider that the total concentration of cobalt species is the sum of all [Co(SCN)_n] and the free [Co^2+]. Let me denote [Co^2+] as [C], [SCN^-] as [S] = 0.1 M.

The concentration of each complex [Co(S)_n] is given by:

[Co(S)_n] = β_n [C] [S]^n / (1 + sum_{k=1 to 4} β_k [S]^k [C] )

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the formation is sequential, each β_n is for the nth complex.

Alternatively, the fraction of each complex can be written as:

f_n = (β_n [S]^n) / (1 + sum_{k=1 to 4} β_k [S]^k )

Because the denominator is the sum of all possible "contributions" from each possible n. The numerator for each f_n is β_n [S]^n. Then, f_n is the fraction of the total cobalt that is in the nth complex.

Wait, let me think. The total concentration of cobalt is:

Total = [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1 to4} [Co(SCN)_n]

Each [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co^2+][S]^n / (1 + sum_{m=1 to 4} β_m [S]^m )

But [Co^2+] is the free ion, and the sum includes all the complexes. So perhaps [Co^2+] can be expressed in terms of the other species.

Alternatively, perhaps the fractions can be normalized without considering [Co^2+] because it's part of all terms.

Wait, maybe each [Co(SCN)_n] is proportional to β_n [S]^n, and the denominator is 1 plus the sum of β_k [S]^k for k=1 to 4.

Because the fractions are relative, perhaps the denominator is (1 + sum β_k [S]^k) and each [Co(SCN)_n] is β_n [S]^n.

Wait, the formula I remember is that for each complex, the fraction f_n is:

f_n = (β_n [S]^n) / (1 + sum_{k=1 to n_max} β_k [S]^k )

But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe I should look for an expression for the fraction of each complex.

Another approach: Using the concept of conditional formation constants.

The fraction of each complex can be determined using the expression:

f_n = (β_n [S]^n) / (1 + sum_{m=1 to 4} β_m [S]^m )

Because the total is the sum of all possible contributions from each complex and the free ion.

So, in this case, the denominator D would be 1 (for free Co^2+) plus the sum of β_1 [S]^1, β_2 [S]^2, β_3 [S]^3, β_4 [S]^4.

Wait, no. Because each β_n is the formation constant for the nth complex. So for each [Co(SCN)_n], the term is β_n [S]^n, and the free Co^2+ is 1 (as [Co^2+] is part of each term). Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, the fraction of the nth complex is (β_n [S]^n) divided by the sum over all possible (β_k [S]^k) plus 1 (for free Co^2+).

So the denominator D is 1 + sum_{k=1 to 4} β_k [S]^k.

Therefore, the fraction f_n is:

f_n = (β_n [S]^n) / D

Where D = 1 + sum_{k=1 to 4} β_k [S]^k.

Because the [Co^2+] is the same in each term, it cancels out when calculating the fraction.

Wait, that makes sense because the fractions are about the distribution of the total cobalt species, and [Co^2+] is a common factor in all terms.

So, given [S] is 0.1 M, let's compute each term.

First, compute each β_k [S]^k for k=1,2,3,4.

β1 [S]^1 = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9

β2 [S]^2 =40 * (0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4

β3 [S]^3 =63 * (0.1)^3=63 * 0.001= 0.063

β4 [S]^4 =16 * (0.1)^4=16 * 0.0001= 0.0016

So the sum of these terms is 0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 = let's compute:

0.9 + 0.4 =1.3; 1.3 +0.063=1.363; 1.363 +0.0016=1.3646.

Then D =1 + sum_terms =1 +1.3646=2.3646.

Wait, no: because D is 1 + sum_{k=1 to4} (β_k [S]^k), which is 1 + (0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016) = 1 +1.3646=2.3646.

Wait, wait, no: wait, the sum is 0.9 + 0.4 =1.3; +0.063 is 1.363; +0.0016 is 1.3646. So D is 1 +1.3646=2.3646.

Wait, but wait: each β_k [S]^k term is for each complex. So the denominator is 1 + sum β_k [S]^k, which is correct.

So for each n, f_n is (β_n [S]^n) / D.

So for n=2, which is the dithiocyanato complex, f_2 = (40 * (0.1)^2 ) / 2.3646.

Wait, calculating each f_n:

f_1 = β1 [S]^1 / D = 0.9 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.3805

f_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1690

f_3 = 0.063 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.0266

f_4 = 0.0016 /2.3646 ≈ 0.000676

Then, the free Co^2+ fraction is 1 / D =1 / 2.3646≈0.4225.

Wait, but wait, in the denominator D, the 1 represents the free Co^2+.

So the fraction of the free ion is 1/D * [Co^2+], but in our case, since the [Co^2+] is part of all terms, the fractions are calculated as f_n = (β_n [S]^n) / D, and the free fraction is 1/D.

Wait, perhaps that's where I went wrong. Because the denominator includes 1 for the free ion, so the free [Co^2+] is 1/(D), but the sum of all f_n plus the free fraction should equal 1.

Let me check:

f_1 ≈0.38, f_2≈0.169, f_3≈0.0266, f_4≈0.000676, and free fraction f_free=1/2.3646≈0.4225.

Adding these up: 0.38 +0.169=0.549; +0.0266=0.5756; +0.000676≈0.5763; +0.4225≈0.9988, which is about 1, considering rounding errors. So that seems correct.

So the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is approximately 0.169, which is 16.9%. So the percentage is about 16.9% of the total cobalt species.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations.

Compute each βk [Sk]:

β1 [S] =9 *0.1=0.9

β2 [S]^2=40*(0.01)=0.4

β3 [S]^3=63 *0.001=0.063

β4 [S]^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016

Sum of these:0.9+0.4=1.3; 1.3+0.063=1.363; 1.363+0.0016=1.3646.

D = 1 +1.3646=2.3646.

So f_2 is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1690, so 16.9%.

That would be option D.

Wait, but the question says 'the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution'.

Wait, the question may have a mistake. Because in the given β values, β4 is 16, which is lower than β3=63. So the most stable complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^-, since β3 is the highest.

But the fraction isn't necessarily the highest for the highest β if the concentration of SCN- affects it.

Wait, but in this case, the [S] is 0.1 M, which is not very high. So the higher-order complexes may not dominate.

Wait, but in the calculation, [Co(SCN)_2] has the second-highest fraction, behind [CoSCN]^+ (n=1). Because 0.9 is higher than 0.4, so [CoSCN]^+ is more abundant.

Hmm, but according to our calculation, the percentage for n=2 is 16.9%, which is option D. So the answer should be D.

But wait, the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So β3 is the largest, 63. But in the calculation, the fraction for n=3 is only 2.66%, which seems low. But perhaps because [S] is 0.1 M, which is lower than 1, so higher-order complexes are less favored.

Wait, let me think about how the stability constants and the [S] concentration affect the distribution.

Stability constants (K or β) generally increase with the number of ligands up to a certain point, then may decrease, depending on the metal and ligand. But in this case, β increases up to n=3, then decreases for n=4.

But the concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M, which is relatively low. So higher-order complexes (n=3 and 4) require more SCN- per Co, so when [S] is low, the higher n complexes are less favored.

So the majority of the Co is in the lower n complexes.

In our calculation, the dominant species is n=1 with ~38%, then n=2 with ~16.9%, then n=3 ~2.66%, and n=4 even less.

So the percentage of blue dithiocyanato (n=2) is 16.9%, which is option D.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants and the given concentrations of Co(II) and SCN⁻. The stability constants are β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16, with [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M and [Co²⁺] = 1 × 10⁻² M.

The fraction of each cobalt complex is calculated using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{D}
\]

where \( D = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^4 \beta_k [\text{SCN}^-]^k \). Here, \( D \) accounts for all possible cobalt species, including the free Co²⁺ ion.

### Step 1: Compute the contributions of each complex
For each \( n \), calculate \( \beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n \):
- \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9 \times 0.1 = 0.9 \)
- \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \times (0.1)^2 = 40 \times 0.01 = 0.4 \)
- \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \times (0.1)^3 = 63 \times 0.001 = 0.063 \)
- \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \times (0.1)^4 = 16 \times 0.0001 = 0.0016 \)

Sum these contributions:
\[
\text{Sum} = 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 1.3646
\]

Add 1 for the free Co²⁺ ion to compute \( D \):
\[
D = 1 + 1.3646 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex
The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)_2]) is:
\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{D} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

### Step 3: Convert to percentage
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex is:
\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%
\]

### Final Answer
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
