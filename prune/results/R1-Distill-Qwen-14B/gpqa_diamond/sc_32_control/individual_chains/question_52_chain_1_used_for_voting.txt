Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about stars and their spectral lines, specifically about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

Alright, let's break down the information given. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Interesting, so the presence of spots lowers the effective temperature.

The question focuses on the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation because that's about population of energy levels in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), which the problem states applies.

The transition between the levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. Wait, I remember that the Boltzmann factor relates the populations of two energy levels. The ratio is given by (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(kT)), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature.

So when the star doesn't have spots, Teff is 6000 K, and when it does, it's 5500 K. The spots cause the overall temperature to drop, so the photosphere is cooler in spots. Wait, but wait—no, the overall effective temperature is lower, but the spots themselves might be cooler regions. Or does the entire photosphere's effective temperature decrease? Hmm, the problem says when 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the star as a whole is radiating at a lower temperature because part of the surface is cooler.

But for the photosphere, the question is about the ratio in the photosphere. So I think each part of the photosphere (the spotted and unspotted regions) has its own temperature. But wait, the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So maybe the entire photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. But wait, no—spotted regions are cooler, and the rest are hotter. Or is the star's total emission lower, which affects the effective temperature. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the problem says when the star's surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, overall Teff is 5500 K. So the star's total flux is lower because the spots are emitting less. But the photosphere is still at 6000 K in the unspotted regions and cooler in the spotted regions. But the question is about the ratio in the stellar photosphere—maybe this is a blended effect, but perhaps I should model it as two blackbody regions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is trying to model the average of the photosphere, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but actually, the problem is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. If the star is in LTE, then each region (spot and non-spot) will have its own excitation based on their local temperature. But the observed spectrum is an average of all regions, weighted by their area and brightness.

So for the no-spots case, all photosphere is at 6000 K. For the spotted case, 60% is at 6000 K, and 40% is at a lower temperature. Let's think about that. So the total emitted flux is a combination of the two regions.

Wait, but the problem states that when the spots are present, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So the star's total radiation is as if it were a blackbody at 5500 K. But for the purpose of the question, when they observe the ratio of Ti levels, they're looking at the photosphere, which is a mixture of the two temperatures.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think again. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. So for each region (spotted and unspotted), the ratio depends on the local temperature.

Suppose the unspotted regions are at 6000 K and the spotted regions are at a lower temperature, say T_spot. When 40% of the surface is covered, the overall effective temperature is 5500 K. So I need to find T_spot.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as a two-component blackbody. The total flux F is the sum of flux from unspotted (6000 K) and spotted (T_spot) regions. The area fractions are f1=0.6 and f2=0.4. So F_total = f1 * B_lambda(T1) + f2 * B_lambda(T2), where B is the Planck function.

But the star's effective temperature is given as 5500 K when 40% is spotted. So F_total = B_lambda(5500 K) when the surface is 40% spotted.

Wait, but how does the presence of spots affect the effective temperature? Because the effective temperature is determined by the total luminosity (which depends on the sum of each region's emission) and the radius. Since the radius hasn't changed, the effective temperature is lower because the luminosity is lower.

So let me model this. The luminosity L is 4π R^2 σ Teff^4. When spots are present, L = 0.6 L1 + 0.4 L2, where L1 is the luminosity per unit area of unspotted regions, and L2 is that of spotted. Oh wait, no: The unspotted regions are 60% of the surface, each emitting at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are 40% at T_spot.

So L_total = 0.6 * (R^2 σ (6000)^4) + 0.4 * (R^2 σ (T_spot)^4). But the effective temperature when spots are present is 5500 K, so:

L_total = 4π R^2 σ (5500)^4.

Dividing both sides by 4π R^2 σ, we get:

0.6 * (6000)^4 + 0.4 * (T_spot)^4 = (5500)^4.

Now I can solve for T_spot.

Let me compute each term:

Compute (6000)^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

0.6 * 1.296e15 = 0.7776e15.

(5500)^4 = (5.5e3)^4 = 5.5^4 * 1e12. 5.5^2 is 30.25, squared is 915.0625. So 915.0625e12 = 9.150625e14.

So:

0.7776e15 + 0.4 (T_spot)^4 = 9.150625e14.

Wait, 0.7776e15 is 7.776e14. So:

7.776e14 + 0.4 (T_spot)^4 = 9.150625e14.

Subtract 7.776e14 from both sides:

0.4 (T_spot)^4 = 9.150625e14 - 7.776e14 = 1.374625e14.

So (T_spot)^4 = (1.374625e14) / 0.4 = 3.4365625e14.

Take the fourth root: T_spot = (3.4365625e14)^(1/4).

Let me compute that. First, 3.4365625e14 is approximately 3.43656e14.

We can write this as 3.43656e14 = 3.43656 * 1e14.

The fourth root of 1e14 is 1e3.5, since (1e3.5)^4 = (1e3)^4 * (1e0.5)^4 )= 1e12 * 1e2 = 1e14.

So 3.43656^(1/4) ≈  (since 1.34^4 is about 3.41, let's see: 1.34^4= (1.34)^2 * (1.34)^2 = (1.7956) * (1.7956) ≈ 3.225. Hmm, 1.35^4= (1.35^2)^2. 1.35^2=1.8225; 1.8225^2≈ 3.320. 1.36^4: 1.36^2=1.8496, squared is about 3.420. So 1.36^4≈3.420. Close to 3.43656.

So 3.43656^(1/4) ≈ 1.36. So T_spot ≈ 1.36 * 1e3.5 K. Wait, 1e3.5 is 3,162 K (since 10^3.5 = sqrt(1e7) = ~3162.27766). So 1.36 * 3162 ≈ 4309 K. Hmm, but wait, that might not be precise. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the fourth root numerically.

But let's see, 3.43656e14.

Take natural logs: ln(3.43656e14) = ln(3.43656) + ln(1e14) ≈ 1.235 + 32.236 = 33.471.

Then (1/4)*ln(x) = 33.471/4 ≈ 8.3678.

So exponentiate: e^8.3678 ≈ Let's calculate e^8 is 2980.911, e^0.3678≈ 1.445. So 2980.911 * 1.445 ≈ 4299 K. Close enough to 4300 K. So T_spot ≈ 4300 K.

Wait, but wait—does this make sense? If the unspotted regions are at 6000 K, and the spotted at 4300 K, and 40% of the surface is at 4300 K, then the average effective temperature is 5500 K. That seems correct.

Now, the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). But when the star has spots, the photosphere is a mix of temperatures, so the observed ratio is a weighted average.

Wait, but let me think. The problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Without spots, all regions are at 6000 K. With spots, 60% at 6000 K and 40% at 4300 K. So the overall ratio is a weighted average of the two ratios.

But wait, maybe in the problem, the observed ratio is the average of the two regions. So when the star has spots, the ratio is a blend of the ratios at 6000 K and 4300 K.

Earlier, the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, the average ratio is lower than when it doesn't. So the factor by which the ratio changes is (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots) = ?

But how do the two ratios compare? The ratio n1/n2 depends inversely on temperature because higher temperatures lead to more excitation. The exponential term is exp( -(delta E)/(k T) ), so as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, making the ratio larger.

Wait, let's be precise. The ratio is proportional to exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So for E2 > E1, which is the case because level 2 is higher energy than level 1, the exponent is negative. So higher T makes the exponent less negative, so the ratio increases. So if T decreases, the ratio decreases.

So when the star has spots, the average T is lower, so the ratio would be lower. Which aligns with the problem statement that the ratio decreases when spots are present.

But wait, without spots, the entire photosphere is at T1=6000 K. With spots, the photosphere is 60% at T1 and 40% at T2=4300 K. So the observed ratio would be an average of the two. So the ratio when there are spots is lower than when there are none because some regions have a lower T, thus a lower ratio.

So to find the factor, I need to compute (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

But wait, (n1/n2)_no_spots is when T=6000 K. (n1/n2)_spots is the average of (n1/n2) in unspotted and spotted regions.

So let's compute this.

Let me denote the ratio as R(T) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

Wait, but since the problem gives the wavelength of the transition, I can compute the energy difference ΔE using the relation ΔE = hc/λ.

So λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

But since we're dealing with ratios, the exact value might not matter because it'll cancel out when taking the ratio of ratios. Wait, but perhaps I need to compute the ratio R(T1)/R(T2), which would involve the exponents.

Wait, but in this case, when the star has spots, the effective temperature is a mix of T1 and T2. So the observed ratio is a weighted average of R(T1) and R(T2).

Wait, no. Because the photons emitted from the two regions (unspotted and spotted) are coming from different temperatures. So the observed spectrum is a mix of the spectra from both regions, so the line ratios would be a flux-weighted average.

Wait, but in LTE, the populations depend on local temperature. So the observed ratio is a flux-weighted average. Because when you observe the line ratio, you're seeing the sum of the fluxes from each region, each contributing their own line strengths.

Alternatively, the equivalent width or the line strength depends on the number of atoms in the upper and lower levels. But for the ratio n1/n2, each region contributes according to its local conditions.

Wait, maybe I should model the observed ratio as a flux-weighted average of the two regions' ratios. Because the flux from each region contributes to the observed line.

Let me think: the total flux from each region is proportional to the area and the Planck function at the transition wavelength. So for each region, the flux is F_i = A_i * B_lambda(T_i), where A_i is the area fraction (0.6 and 0.4), and B is the Planck function.

The line strength for Ti in each level is proportional to n_i * f_i, where f_i is the oscillator strength. But since the question is about the ratio of n1/n2, perhaps the oscillator strengths cancel out.

Wait, but the ratio of the line strengths (emission or absorption) would depend on the number of atoms in each level. So the observed ratio would be a flux-weighted average of the (n1/n2) * (B_lambda(T_i)) in each region.

Wait, perhaps the line ratio (n1/n2)_observed = [sum (n1 * B1) ] / [sum (n2 * B2) ]

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the total number of atoms in level 1 and level 2 across the entire photosphere would be the sum from each region.

Wait, perhaps the observed ratio is (Total n1)/(Total n2), where Total n1 = f1 * n1(T1) * A1 + f2 * n1(T2) * A2, and similarly for n2.

Wait, but A is the area, so for each region, A1 is 0.6 * R^2, A2 is 0.4 * R^2. So when you calculate the total number of Ti atoms in each level, it's sum over regions.

But the ratio is (total n1)/(total n2).

So let me model this.

Let me denote n1(T) as the number of atoms in level 1 at temperature T, and n2(T) as the number in level 2.

The ratio R(T) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So without spots, R_no_spots = R(6000) = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k * 6000)).

With spots, the photosphere has two regions: 60% at 6000 K and 40% at 4300 K.

So the total n1 is 0.6 * n1(6000) + 0.4 * n1(4300).

Similarly, total n2 is 0.6 * n2(6000) + 0.4 * n2(4300).

So the observed ratio R_spots = [0.6 R(6000) + 0.4 R(4300)] / [0.6 (n2(6000)/n1(6000)) + 0.4 (n2(4300)/n1(4300)) ) ].

Wait, but perhaps that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, since R(T) = n1/n2, we can write n1 = R(T) * n2.

So total n1 = 0.6 R(6000) n2(6000) + 0.4 R(4300) n2(4300).

Total n2 = 0.6 n2(6000) + 0.4 n2(4300).

So R_spots = [0.6 R(6000) n2(6000) + 0.4 R(4300) n2(4300)] / [0.6 n2(6000) + 0.4 n2(4300)].

Hmm, but perhaps I can factor out n2 from numerator and denominator.

Wait, but n2(T) itself depends on T. Because n2 = (g2 / (g1 + g2)) ) * something. Wait no, the population ratio is given by R(T) = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So n1 = R(T) * n2.

But the total number of neutral Ti atoms is n1 + n2 = n_total. So for each region, n1 = R(T) * n2, so n2 = n_total / (1 + R(T)).

Wait, maybe I can parametrize it differently. Let's define for each region, the ratio R_i = R(T_i) = (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T_i)).

So R_i = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k T_i)).

Thus, for each region, n1_i = R_i * n2_i.

The total n1 = sum( n1_i ) = sum( R_i * n2_i )

Total n2 = sum( n2_i )

Let me denote n2_i = (n_total_i) / (1 + R_i )

But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio R_spots = (0.6 R(6000) + 0.4 R(4300)) / (0.6 + 0.4) ) ?

Wait, no, that's not correct because the denominator is not simply 1; it's 0.6 + 0.4 = 1, but the numerator is a weighted sum of R(T) terms. But that's only if the n2 in each region is the same, which it's not.

Alternatively, perhaps the assumption is that the contribution to the line ratio is proportional to the area and the population ratio, but I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the observed ratio is a flux-weighted average of the ratios from each region. Because the line strength depends on the number of atoms in each level and the Planck function (emission or absorption). For an absorption line, the equivalent width depends on the column density, which depends on n and path length.

Alternatively, perhaps the line ratio is simply the sum of the contributions from each region, weighted by their area and the populations.

Wait, perhaps the ratio we observe is the sum over each region of (n1_i / n2_i) * (B_lambda(T_i) ) / total_B, where total_B is the sum of B_lambda(T_i) across regions.

Hmm, because the line strength is proportional to n and the source function. For absorption lines, the source function is approximately the Planck function at the local temperature.

So the equivalent width (and hence the line ratio) is proportional to n1 B1 + n2 B2? Or perhaps the line ratio is the sum of (n1 B1)/(n2 B2), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe the problem expects a simpler approach. Let's think about the ratio of the ratio.

Let me compute R(6000) and R(4300).

R(T) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Since g1 and g2 are constants, the ratio R(T1)/R(T2) is exp( [ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ] )

Because R(T1) = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R(T2) = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So R(T1)/R(T2) = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

So let's compute that.

First, compute ΔE.

ΔE = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 J s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) 

= (1.9878e-25 J m) / 1.448e-7 m 

= 1.372e-18 J.

Now, Boltzmann's constant k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = 1.372e-18 / 1.38e-23 ≈ 9.95e4 ≈ 99500 K.

So ΔE/(k) ≈ 99500 K.

Now, compute (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)):

T1 = 6000 K, T2=4300 K.

1/4300 ≈ 0.00023256,

1/6000 ≈ 0.00016667.

Difference: 0.00023256 - 0.00016667 = 0.00006589.

So (ΔE/k) * (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) = 99500 * 0.00006589 ≈ 99500 * 6.589e-5 ≈ 99500 * 6.589e-5 = 99500 * 6.589e-5 ≈ Let's compute 99500 * 6.589e-5.

Well, 1e5 * 6.589e-5 = 0.6589.

So 99500 * 6.589e-5 ≈ 99500 * 6.589e-5 = (1e5 - 500) * 6.589e-5 = 0.6589 - (500 * 6.589e-5)

500 *6.589e-5 = 0.032945.

So 0.6589 - 0.032945 ≈ 0.62595.

So the exponent is approximately 0.62595.

So R(T1)/R(T2) = exp(0.62595) ≈ e^0.62595 ≈ Let's compute that.

e^0.6 is about 1.822.

e^0.625 = Let's compute:

We know that ln(1.865) ≈ 0.625 because:

ln(1.85) ≈ 0.615, ln(1.86) ≈ 0.620, ln(1.865)=0.625.

So e^0.625 ≈ 1.865.

So R(T1)/R(T2) ≈ 1.865.

But wait, the problem asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when there are no spots compared to when there are spots. So the factor is R_no_spots / R_spots.

Wait, but R_spots is the average ratio when spots are present.

But earlier, we thought that R_spots is the average of R(T1) and R(T2), but that's not exactly correct because it's a flux-weighted average, not an area-weighted average. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the observed ratio is the area-weighted average of R(T_i).

Wait, no, the observed line ratio would be a flux-weighted average, because the flux from each region contributes to the line strength. So the flux from each region is proportional to the area times the Planck function at the transition wavelength.

So the flux from the unspotted regions is f1 * B_lambda(T1), and from spotted regions f2 * B_lambda(T2).

The total flux is F_total = f1 * B(T1) + f2 * B(T2).

The line ratio is proportional to (n1/n2) for each region, but the line strength is proportional to n_i * B(T_i). So the observed line ratio is (sum (n1_i * B_i )) / (sum (n2_i * B_i )).

But n1_i = R_i * n2_i.

So the line ratio is [sum (R_i n2_i * B_i ) ] / [sum (n2_i * B_i ) ] = [sum (R_i B_i ) ] / [sum (B_i) ) ] * [sum (n2_i B_i ) ] / [sum (n2_i B_i ) ].

Wait, sorry, more accurately:

The observed ratio R_obs = (sum (n1_i * B_i )) / (sum (n2_i * B_i )) 

= [sum (R_i * n2_i * B_i ) ] / [sum (n2_i * B_i ) ]

= [sum (R_i * B_i ) * n2_i ] / [sum (B_i * n2_i ) ]

But unless all n2_i are the same, this isn't simply [sum (R_i * B_i ) ] / [sum (B_i ) ].

But this seems complicated. Maybe the problem is assuming that all regions have the same n2_i, which would make the ratio R_obs = [sum (R_i * B_i ) ] / [sum (B_i ) ].

But is that a valid assumption? Not really, because n2_i depends on the local conditions, which vary with T. But perhaps for the sake of this problem, the assumption is that the number of Ti atoms is uniform across the photosphere, so n2_i is same for all regions, which would make R_obs = [sum (R_i * B_i ) ] / [sum (B_i ) ].

Alternatively, maybe in this problem, the Ti abundance is uniform, so the number of Ti atoms in each region is proportional to the area, so n1_i = R_i * n2_i, and n2_i = A_i * n, where A_i is the area fraction (0.6 or 0.4) and n is the number density.

In that case, total n1 = sum (R_i * n2_i ) = sum ( R_i * A_i * n )

Total n2 = sum (A_i * n )

So R_obs = [sum ( R_i A_i n ) ] / [sum (A_i n ) ] = [sum ( R_i A_i ) ] / [sum ( A_i ) ] 

Since sum (A_i) is 1 (0.6 + 0.4), R_obs = sum ( R_i A_i )

So R_obs = 0.6 R(6000) + 0.4 R(4300)

So the observed ratio when there are spots is R_spots = 0.6 R(6000) + 0.4 R(4300)

Wait, that's a possible approach. Then, the ratio without spots is R_no_spots = R(6000).

So the factor is R_no_spots / R_spots = R(6000) / [0.6 R(6000) + 0.4 R(4300) ]

But wait, let's compute R(6000) and R(4300).

We have R(T) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

But to find the ratio of R(6000) to R(4300), we can compute R(6000)/R(4300) = exp[ (ΔE/k) (1/4300 - 1/6000) ) ]

Wait, because R(T) is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), so:

R(6000) = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k *6000) )

R(4300) = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k *4300) )

So R(6000)/R(4300) = exp( (ΔE/k) [ 1/6000 - 1/4300 ] )

Compute the exponent:

(1/6000 - 1/4300) = (4300 - 6000) / (6000 *4300) ) 

= (-1700) / (25800000) = approx -6.596e-5.

Multiply by ΔE/k ≈99500 K.

So exponent = 99500 * (-6.596e-5) ≈ 99500 * (-6.596e-5) 

= 99500 * (-6.596e-5) = 99500 * (-0.00006596) ≈ 

Compute 100,000 * 0.00006596 = 6.596.

So 99500 is 99.5% of 100,000. So 99.5% of 6.596 is approximately 6.565. So exponent ≈ -6.565.

So R(6000)/R(4300) = exp(-6.565) ≈ 0.00137.

Wait, because exp(-6) is about 0.002479, exp(-7) is about 0.0009119. So 6.565 is between 6 and 7. Let's compute more accurately.

Compute 6.565:

We can use a calculator approximation. Let me think, ln(0.001) is about -6.908. So 6.565 is less than that, so exp(-6.565) is around 0.0014.

Wait, perhaps better to compute it as:

exp(-6.565) ≈ 1 / exp(6.565)

We know that exp(6) = 403.4288,

exp(0.565) ≈ e^0.5 ≈1.6487, e^0.565 ≈ approximately 1.760.

So exp(6.565) ≈ 403.4288 * 1.760 ≈ 403.4288 * 1.76 ≈ 403.4288 * 1.7 = 685.8, 403.4288 * 0.06 = 24.2057. So total ≈ 685.8 + 24.2057 ≈ 710. So 1/710 ≈ 0.001408.

So R(6000)/R(4300) ≈ 0.001408.

So R(6000) = 0.001408 * R(4300).

But wait, that's R(6000) = 0.001408 R(4300).

So the ratio R_spots = 0.6 R(6000) + 0.4 R(4300) = 0.6 * 0.001408 R(4300) + 0.4 R(4300) = (0.0008448 + 0.4) R(4300) = 0.4008448 R(4300).

Now, the ratio without spots is R_no_spots = R(6000) = 0.001408 R(4300).

So the factor is R_no_spots / R_spots = [0.001408 R(4300)] / [0.4008448 R(4300)] = 0.001408 / 0.4008448 ≈ approximately 0.00351.

Wait, that's about 0.0035, so the factor is about 1/0.0035 ≈ 285. But that doesn't match any of the options. Hmm, this suggests I've made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the order. Because R(T) = n1/n2. When the star has spots, the ratio R_spots is lower than R_no_spots, but in my calculation, R_spots is about 0.4 R(4300), which is much lower than R(6000), which is 0.0014 R(4300). So when I compute R_no_spots / R_spots, it's (0.0014 R_4300) / (0.4 R_4300) )= 0.0014 / 0.4 = 0.0035.

But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, so R_spots < R_no_spots. But in this calculation, R_spots is 0.4 R_4300 and R_no_spots is 0.0014 R_4300. That would mean R_no_spots is smaller than R_spots, which contradicts the problem statement.

Hmm, so I must have messed up the calculation. Let me re-examine.

Wait, when T increases, the ratio R(T) increases because higher T causes more population in higher energy levels. So R(6000) is higher than R(4300). Because for R(T) = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, making R(T) larger.

So R(6000) > R(4300). So the calculation R(6000)/R(4300) = exp( ΔE/k (1/4300 - 1/6000) )

Wait, earlier I got that as exp( 99500 * ( (1/4300) - (1/6000) ) )? Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me re-calculate the exponent.

Earlier, the exponent for R(T1)/R(T2) is (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1).

So when T1=6000, T2=4300.

So 1/T2=1/4300 ≈ 0.00023256,

1/T1=1/6000≈0.00016667.

So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = 0.00023256 - 0.00016667 = 0.00006589.

Multiply by ΔE/k ≈99500 K:

99500 * 0.00006589 ≈ 6.565.

So R(T1)/R(T2) = exp(6.565) ≈ 710.

Ah! I think I made a mistake earlier by taking the reciprocal. So R(6000)/R(4300) = exp(6.565) ≈ 710.

So R(6000) ≈ 710 * R(4300).

Now, R_spots = 0.6 * R(6000) + 0.4 * R(4300) = 0.6 *710 R4300 + 0.4 R4300 = (426 + 0.4) R4300 = 426.4 R4300.

R_no_spots = R(6000) = 710 R4300.

So the factor is R_no_spots / R_spots = (710 R4300) / (426.4 R4300) )= 710 / 426.4 ≈ 1.664.

Wait, that's about 1.66. So the ratio increases by a factor of ~1.66 when there are no spots compared to when there are spots.

But the options don't have this. Let me see the options:

A) ~1.1

B) ~7.8

C) ~4.5

D) ~2.9

Hmm, 1.66 isn't an option. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the way I calculate R_spots. Perhaps the observed ratio is not the area-weighted average but the flux-weighted average.

Because the flux from each region is F_i = B_lambda(T_i) * A_i.

So the total flux is F_total = 0.6 B(6000) + 0.4 B(4300).

The observed ratio R_obs is sum [ (n1_i / n2_i ) * (F_i / F_total) ) ]

Because the line ratio from each region contributes proportionally to their flux.

So R_obs = [ (R(6000) * 0.6 B(6000) ) + (R(4300) * 0.4 B(4300) )) ] / [ 0.6 B(6000) + 0.4 B(4300) ) ]

So R_obs = [ 0.6 R(6000) B(6000) + 0.4 R(4300) B(4300) ) ] / [ 0.6 B(6000) + 0.4 B(4300) ) ]

Hmm, that's more accurate, as it takes into account the flux from each region.

But now I need to compute B_lambda(6000) and B_lambda(4300) at 1448 Å.

Wait, but wait: the wavelength is 1448 Å, which is in the visible or near UV. So the Planck function at that wavelength for a star's temperature.

We can use the approximation for blackbody radiation: B_lambda(T) = (2 hc^2)/(lambda^5) * 1/(exp(hc/(lambda k T)) - 1 )

But calculating this exactly would be time-consuming, but perhaps we can approximate it by noting that for a given wavelength, hotter bodies have higher B_lambda.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio B(6000)/B(4300) at λ=1448 Å.

Compute this ratio.

Compute:

B(6000)/B(4300) = [ (2 hc^2)/(lambda^5) * 1/(exp(hc/(lambda k *6000)) - 1 ) ] / [ (2 hc^2)/(lambda^5) * 1/(exp(hc/(lambda k *4300)) - 1 ) ]

= [ exp( hc/(lambda k *4300) - 1 ) ] / [ exp( hc/(lambda k *6000) - 1 ) ]

= exp( hc/(lambda k) (1/4300 - 1/6000) )

We can compute the exponent.

h c / (lambda k) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10 * 1.38e-23)

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1448e-10 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1.448e-7 m *1.38e-23 J/K = 1.448e-7 *1.38e-23 = 1.988e-30 J·m/K.

So h c/(lambda k) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.988e-30 ≈ (1.9878 / 1.988) * 1e5 ≈ 1e5.

So hc/(lambda k) ≈ 1e5 K.

Now compute (1/4300 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 4300)/(4300 *6000) ) =1700/(25800000) ≈ 6.596e-5.

Multiply by 1e5: 6.596e-5 *1e5 =6.596.

So the exponent is 6.596.

So B(6000)/B(4300) = exp(6.596) ≈ 710.

Wait, because exp(6.596) is about 710 (as before).

So B(6000) ≈ 710 * B(4300).

Now, let's plug this into R_obs:

R_obs = [0.6 R(6000) * B(6000) + 0.4 R(4300) * B(4300)] / [0.6 B(6000) + 0.4 B(4300) ]

Substitute B(6000) =710 B(4300):

= [0.6*(710 R(4300)) *710 B(4300) + 0.4*R(4300)*B(4300) ] / [ 0.6 *710 B(4300) + 0.4 B(4300) ]

Factor B(4300) out:

Numerator: B(4300) [ 0.6 *710^2 R(4300) + 0.4 R(4300) ]

Denominator: B(4300) [ 0.6*710 + 0.4 ]

So B(4300) cancels.

= [ 0.6 *710^2 R(4300) + 0.4 R(4300) ] / [ 0.6 *710 + 0.4 ]

Factor R(4300) in numerator:

= R(4300) [ 0.6 *710^2 + 0.4 ] / [0.6*710 + 0.4 ]

Compute numerator:

0.6 *710^2 = 0.6 *504100 =302460.

0.4: 0.4.

So numerator: 302460 +0.4 =302460.4.

Denominator: 0.6*710=426; 426 +0.4=426.4.

So R_obs = R(4300) * (302460.4 /426.4 )

Compute 302460.4 /426.4 ≈ 709.

So R_obs ≈709 R(4300).

Wait, but R_no_spots is R(6000)=710 R(4300).

So R_obs ≈709 R(4300) which is nearly equal to R(6000). That can't be right.

Wait, this would imply that when there are spots, the observed ratio is almost the same as when there are no spots, which contradicts the problem statement that the ratio decreases.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in B(6000)/B(4300).

Wait, let me recompute the Planck ratio.

Earlier, I said that B(6000)/B(4300) = exp(6.596) ≈710.

But wait, that's correct because when T increases, B_lambda increases for a given wavelength. But at 1448 Å, which is a wavelength where the blackbody curve is in the Wien's tail for cooler stars.

Wait, let's compute hc/(lambda k T) for T=6000 K and 4300 K.

Compute hc/(lambda k T) for each T.

lambda =1448e-10 m.

For T=6000 K: hc/(lambda k T) = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (1448e-10 * 1.38e-23 *6000 )

=1.9878e-25 / (1.448e-7 *1.38e-23 *6000 )

Denominator: 1.448e-7 *1.38e-23 = 1.988e-30; multiplied by 6000: 1.1928e-26.

So 1.9878e-25 / 1.1928e-26 ≈ 16.67.

Similarly, for T=4300 K: denominator is 1.448e-7 *1.38e-23 *4300 =1.448e-7 * 5.964e-20 =8.637e-27.

So 1.9878e-25 /8.637e-27≈ 22.98.

Wait, so hc/(lambda k T) is about 16.67 for T=6000 and 22.98 for T=4300.

The exponent in B(T) is 1/(exp(x) -1), where x= hc/(lambda k T).

So x=16.67 for T=6000: exp(16.67) is a huge number, so 1/(exp(16.67) -1) is nearly zero. Similarly for T=4300, x=22.98: 1/(exp(22.98)-1) ≈ 0.

But wait, how does this affect B_lambda(T)?

Wait, B_lambda(T)= (2 hc^2)/(lambda^5) * 1/(exp(hc/(lambda k T)) -1 )

So for each T, x=hc/(lambda k T) is much larger than 1. So exp(x) >>1, so 1/(exp(x) -1) ≈ exp(-x).

So B_lambda(T) ≈ (2 hc^2)/(lambda^5) exp(-x).

Thus, B(6000) ≈ (2 hc^2)/(lambda^5) exp(-16.67)

B(4300) ≈ same factor * exp(-22.98)

So B(6000)/B(4300) = exp( (22.98 -16.67) ) = exp(6.31) ≈ 553.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 710, but this more precise calculation gives 553.

So B(6000)/B(4300) ≈553.

Ah, so earlier I made a mistake in the calculation. So let's redo with this.

So B(6000) =553 B(4300).

Now, let's compute R_obs.

R_obs = [0.6 * R(6000) * B(6000) + 0.4 * R(4300) * B(4300) ] / [0.6 B(6000) + 0.4 B(4300) ]

Substituting B(6000) =553 B_4300:

= [0.6 * R(6000) *553 B_4300 +0.4 R(4300) B_4300 ] / [ 0.6 *553 B_4300 + 0.4 B_4300 ]

Factor out B_4300:

= [ 0.6 *553 * R(6000) + 0.4 R(4300) ] / [0.6 *553 +0.4 ]

We already have R(6000) =710 R(4300).

So:

= [0.6 *553 *710 R(4300) +0.4 R(4300) ] / [0.6*553 +0.4 ]

= R(4300) [ 0.6 *553 *710 +0.4 ] / [0.6*553 +0.4 ]

Compute numerator:

0.6 *553 =331.8; 331.8 *710 = 235, 331.8 *700=232,260; 331.8*10=3,318 → total 235,578.

So 0.6 *553 *710 = 235,578.

Add 0.4: 235,578.4.

Denominator:

0.6 *553 =331.8; 331.8 +0.4=332.2.

So R_obs = R(4300) * (235578.4 / 332.2 ) ≈ R(4300)*709.

So R_obs ≈709 R(4300).

But R_no_spots = R(6000) =710 R(4300).

Thus, R_no_spots / R_spots ≈710 R_4300 / (709 R_4300) ≈1.0014.

Which is approximately 1. So the factor is about 1. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So what's wrong?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Ah! Oh wait, when we have spots, the star is cooler overall, so the average ratio should be lower. But according to this calculation, R_obs is almost the same as R_no_spots. That's a contradiction.

Alternatively, perhaps the way I'm calculating R_obs is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is dominated by the hotter regions because they emit more flux at the given wavelength (1448 Å), which is in the blue. So most of the flux comes from the hotter regions, which have higher R(T). Thus, the average R_obs would be close to R(6000), which would mean that the factor is about 1, but the problem states the ratio decreases. So my approach must be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't require taking into account the flux weighting but only the temperature in the photosphere. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplified. The observed ratio depends only on the temperature of the photosphere. When spots are present, the photosphere is at 5500 K. So R(T) is computed at T=5500 K.

But wait, that's not correct because the presence of spots doesn't just lower the average T but creates a mix.

But let me think. Maybe the problem wants us to compute the ratio using T=5500 K, ignoring the fact that the temperature is mixed.

So compute R(6000)/R(5500).

What would this be?

Compute R(6000)/R(5500)= exp( (ΔE/k)(1/5500 -1/6000) )

ΔE/k as before is 99500 K.

Compute 1/5500 ≈0.0001818, 1/6000≈0.0001667.

Difference: 0.0001818 -0.0001667=0.0000151.

Multiply by 99500: 99500 *0.0000151=1.502.

So exponent is 1.502.

Thus, R(6000)/R(5500)=exp(1.502)≈4.49.

Which is approximately 4.5, matching option C.

But wait, the problem says the star's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. So perhaps the observed ratio is computed at 5500 K instead of a mix.

But earlier approach of considering a weighted average gave a factor of ~1.001, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to compute the ratio change using the two temperatures, 6000 and 5500 K, not considering the detailed mixture.

So R(6000)/R(5500)=exp( (ΔE/k)(1/5500 -1/6000) )=exp( (99500)( (6000-5500)/(5500*6000) ) )

Wait, compute 1/5500 -1/6000= (6000-5500)/(5500*6000)=500/(33000000)=1/(66000)= approx 1.515e-5.

Multiply by 99500: 99500 *1.515e-5= approx 1.507.

So exp(1.507)=4.5.

Which matches option C.

So perhaps the problem expects this approach, assuming that the effective temperature of 5500 K is used, not considering the detailed spot and non-spot regions.

But why would that be the case? Because the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present.

Wait, but the photosphere's effective temperature is a measure of the average flux, not the local temperatures. So perhaps the assumption is that the average temperature is 5500 K, and hence the ratio is R(5500).

Thus, the factor is R(6000)/R(5500)=exp( (ΔE/k)(1/5500 -1/6000) )= ~4.5.

So the answer would be option C) ~4.5.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots, we analyze the problem using the Boltzmann equation and the given data.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - When no spots are present, the effective temperature is \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature decreases to \( T_{\text{eff}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Energy Levels**:
   - The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \).
   - The energy difference between the levels is \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).

3. **Boltzmann Equation**:
   The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:
   \[
   \frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
   \]
   where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

4. **Simplification**:
   The ratio of populations at two temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) is:
   \[
   \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
   \]

### Calculation:
1. **Energy Difference**:
   Using \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \):
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Temperature Ratio Term**:
   Compute \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} \):
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99500 \, \text{K}.
   \]

3. **Exponent**:
   For \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33000000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]
   Multiply by \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} \):
   \[
   99500 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.507.
   \]

4. **Population Ratio**:
   The ratio of population ratios is:
   \[
   \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp(1.507) \approx 4.5.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels changes when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots is approximately **4.5**.

ANSWER: C
