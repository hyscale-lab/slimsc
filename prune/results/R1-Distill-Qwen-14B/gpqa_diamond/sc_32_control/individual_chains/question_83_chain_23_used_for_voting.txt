Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully and try to figure out what's going on.

The question says that we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each with two pH values.

Hmm. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, it's a neutralization reaction. The reaction would produce acetate ions and water. 

First, I think I should calculate the initial concentration after dilution. So, we have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Wait, because 20 + 20 is 40. So the concentration after dilution would be half, right? Because concentration is moles over volume, and we're doubling the volume. So initial concentration C1 is 0.05 M, volume V1 is 20 cm³. Diluted to V2 = 40 cm³. So C2 = (C1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 * 20) /40 = 1 /40 = 0.0125 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.0125 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid first.

Moles of CH3COOH initially after dilution: 0.0125 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) = 0.0005 moles.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed are same as moles of acetic acid, so 0.0005 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume V would be moles / concentration = 0.0005 / 0.1 = 0.005 L, which is 5 cm³.

So the equivalence point volume is 5 cm³. Now, the first part of the question is about the pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume. That's 5 cm³ * 0.25 = 1.25 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, but wait. No, wait. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. So 25% titration is when 25% of the required NaOH has been added. So in this case, the volume of NaOH used is 25% of 5 cm³, which is 1.25 cm³. So at this point, only a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So we'll have a buffer solution.

The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.0005 moles. Moles of NaOH added at 25% is 0.1 M * 0.00125 L = 0.000125 moles. So the NaOH will react with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.0005 - 0.000125 = 0.000375 moles.

Moles of CH3COO^- produced: 0.000125 moles.

The total volume at this point is the initial solution volume (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (1.25 cm³). So 41.25 cm³ or 0.04125 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.000375 / 0.04125 ≈ 0.00909 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.000125 / 0.04125 ≈ 0.00303 M

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) ≈ 4.738 (since sqrt(1.8e-5) is about 4.74). Let me compute more accurately: log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5) = 0.267 + (-5) = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733, approximately 4.73 or 4.74.

Wait, wait, the Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log ([A^-]/[HA]).

So [A^-] is 0.00303, [HA] is 0.00909.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 0.00303 / 0.00909 ≈ 0.333.

Log(0.333) is about -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.253. So approximately 4.25. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. But let me check.

Wait, maybe I should calculate more accurately.

Let me recalculate the concentrations.

Moles of HA: 0.000375 moles.

Volume is 40 + 1.25 = 41.25 cm³ = 0.04125 L.

Concentration of HA: 0.000375 / 0.04125 = 0.0090909 M.

Concentration of A^-: 0.000125 / 0.04125 = 0.0030303 M.

Ratio A^- / HA = 0.0030303 / 0.0090909 ≈ 0.333333.

Log(1/3) is approx -0.4771.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.4771 ≈ 4.256. So about 4.26. So first value is 4.26, which is option A or D?

Looking at the options:

A) 4.26; 8.52

D) 4.57; 6.92

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Because the second part is about the pH at equivalence point. Let's think about that.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid is converted into acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate. Sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution will be basic.

The concentration of acetate ions is moles of acetate divided by the total volume.

Total volume at equivalence point is 40 cm³ (diluted acid) +5 cm³ (NaOH) =45 cm³=0.045 L.

Moles of CH3COO^-: 0.0005 moles.

So concentration is 0.0005 / 0.045 ≈ 0.01111 M.

The acetate ion (A^-) will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. So Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis equation's Kb is 5.405e-10. The initial concentration is 0.01111 M. Let me set up the ICE table.

Initial:
[CH3COO^-] = 0.01111 M
[CH3COOH] = 0
[OH^-] = 0

Change:
- x
+ x
+ x

Equilibrium:
[CH3COO^-] = 0.01111 - x ≈ 0.01111 (since x is very small)
[CH3COOH] = x
[OH^-] = x

So Kb = x² / (0.01111) = 5.405e-10
x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.01111 ≈ 5.405e-10 * 1.111e-2 = (5.405 *1.111) e-12 ≈ ~6e-12.

So x = sqrt(6e-12) ≈ 7.746e-6.

So [OH^-] =7.746e-6.

pOH = -log(7.746e-6) ≈ Let's compute that. Log(7.746) is about 0.888, so log(7.746e-6) is 0.888 -6 = -5.112. So pOH is 5.112.

So pH =14 -5.112=8.888. Hmm, but looking at the options, the equivalence point pH are 8.52 (A), 6.73 (B), 7.00 (C), 6.92 (D). So 8.88 isn't any of them. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the Kb calculation. Let's recalculate Kb.

Ka for acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 =5.405e-10. That's correct.

Wait, but maybe I messed up the concentration at equivalence point. Let me recheck.

Moles of CH3COOH initially after dilution: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Wait wait wait, wait a second. Wait, wait no. Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles is 0.05 M * 0.02 L= 0.001 moles. Then we diluted it to 40 cm³, so concentration is 0.001 /0.04 =0.025 M? Wait, no. Wait, I think I messed up earlier in the initial calculation.

Wait, wait wait. Let me double-check the initial calculations. Because this mistake might have thrown off everything.

The question says we take 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, then add 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40.00 cm³.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.05 M * 0.02 L= 0.001 moles. Oh wait, before, I thought the diluted concentration was 0.0125 M, but that's wrong. Because 0.05 M *20 mL is 0.001 moles. So when you dilute to 40 mL, the concentration is 0.001 /0.04 =0.025 M. Oh no! I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, I think I had it wrong earlier. So 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So 0.05 M *0.02 L=0.001 mol. Then, after adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So concentration is 0.001 /0.04 =0.025 M. So my earlier calculation was wrong; I thought it was 0.0125 M, but it's 0.025 M.

Oh no, this changes everything. So I need to recalculate everything.

So initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.025 M *0.04 L =0.001 mol.

When titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. So at equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed are 0.001 mol. So volume V= moles / concentration = 0.001 /0.1=0.01 L=10 cm³.

So equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

Wait, so 25% titration is 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³.

So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L=0.00025 mol.

This reacts with acetic acid: CH3COOH + OH^- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 -0.00025=0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume now is 40 cm³ +2.5 cm³=42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

Concentration of CH3COOH: 0.00075 /0.0425 ≈0.017647 M.

Concentration of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 /0.0425≈0.005882 M.

Now, using Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5))=4.733.

The ratio [A^-]/[HA]= (0.005882)/(0.017647)= approx 0.3333.

Log(0.3333)= -0.477.

So pH=4.733 -0.477=4.256≈4.26.

So the first pH is about 4.26.

Now for the equivalence point. Let's calculate it correctly now.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized, so we have 0.001 mol of CH3COO^-.

The total volume is 40 cm³ +10 cm³=50 cm³=0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate ions: 0.001 /0.05=0.02 M.

Now, acetate ion is a weak base. Kb=Kw/Ka= (1e-14)/(1.85e-5)=5.405e-10.

So Kb=5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The initial concentration is 0.02 M, and the change is -x, +x, +x.

At equilibrium:

[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

[CH3COOH] =x.

[OH^-]=x.

Kb = (x^2)/(0.02) =5.405e-10.

So x²=5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11.

x= sqrt(1.081e-11)= 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-]=1.04e-5.

pOH= -log(1.04e-5)=5 - log(1.04)=5-0.017=4.983.

pH=14 -4.983≈9.017.

Wait, but none of the options have a pH around 9. Hmm. But looking back, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recalculate Kb and the hydrolysis.

Wait, Kb is Kw/Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb=1e-14/(1.85e-5)=5.405e-10.

So x²= Kb * C =5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11.

x= sqrt(1.081e-11)= approximately 1.04e-5.

So [OH-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.983 → pH≈9.017.

But none of the options have a pH around 9. So either I'm making a mistake, or perhaps the initial calculations were incorrect.

Wait, let me check the moles again. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So 0.001 mol of acetate in 50 cm³.

Concentration =0.001 /0.05=0.02 M.

Wait, so why is the pH so high? Because acetate is a weak base, so the solution is basic. pH around 9.01.

But the options don't have anything near that. So perhaps I'm doing something wrong.

Wait, let me think again. Wait, the problem says "25% titration" — perhaps I interpreted it wrong. Wait, 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence point?

Wait, the equivalence point is 10 cm³, as I calculated.

So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, which is what I did.

Another point: Maybe I should consider the dilution at 25% titration correctly.

At 25% titration, the solution is a buffer. So I think my calculation for pH=4.26 is correct.

But for the equivalence point, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the pH.

Alternatively, perhaps the given options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Wait another thought: Maybe the problem considers that the solution after equivalence is excess OH-? No, because at equivalence, all acid is neutralized, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: Using the formula for the pH of a salt solution.

The pH can be found using:

pH = ½ (pKa + pKw - log C )

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, another way: The pH of the solution is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion. So:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

Kb = Kw / Ka = 5.405e-10.

The concentration is 0.02 M.

So, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assume x is small compared to 0.02, so:

x² /0.02 =5.405e-10 → x²= 1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.983 → pH=9.017.

But none of the options have a pH of 9.0. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52

Option D:4.57; 6.92.

Hmm, perhaps I miscalculated the Kb.

Wait, let me compute Kb again.

Ka =1.85e-5 → pKa=4.733.

Kb= Kw/Ka=1e-14/(1.85e-5)=5.405e-10 → correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact formula without approximation.

So, the exact expression is x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, 0.02-x ≈0.02.

So x²=5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x≈1.04e-5.

So [OH-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.017.

Hmm, but none of the options have 9.017. So perhaps an error exists elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles.

Wait, initial acetic acid after dilution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. Moles=0.05 *0.02=0.001 mol. Then diluted to 40 cm³, so 0.04 L. So concentration is 0.001 /0.04=0.025 M. So at equivalence, 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is needed.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the pH at equivalence point is about 9.01.

But the options don't have anything close. So perhaps I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH using another method. Let me think.

Alternative approach: The solution at equivalence point is 0.02 M CH3COO^-.

The pH can be calculated using the formula:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

But wait, at equivalence point, all the acid is converted to A^- and no HA remains. Wait no, because in solution, some HA would form due to hydrolysis. Wait, but in the case of a salt solution, it's only A^- and water.

No, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me think about the concentration of H+.

Wait, no. The solution is basic, so I should stick with OH- concentration.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in Kb. Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Ka=1.85e-5 → so pKa=4.733.

Kb=1e-14/1.85e-5=5.405405e-10.

So Kb=5.405405e-10.

The expression is x^2/(0.02 -x)=5.405405e-10.

So x^2=0.02 *5.405405e-10=1.081081e-11 → x=√(1.081081e-11)= approximately 1.04e-5.

So [OH-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=14-4.98=9.02.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I've made a mistake in my calculation steps.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH at equivalence point using a different method.

Another approach: Using the formula:

pH = ½ (pKa + pKw + log C )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem familiar. Alternatively, maybe using the relationship between pH and pOH.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is a weak base, so pH is determined by the Kb and concentration.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong approach. Let me try using the exact expression.

x^2/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10 → assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, which it is because Kb is small. So 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

x=√(5.405e-10 *0.02)=√(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

So [OH-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Hmm. But none of the options for the equivalence point are near 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution after equivalence point is not just the acetate ion, but some excess NaOH. But no, at equivalence point, all the acid is neutralized, so no excess OH- from NaOH.

Wait, another thought: Did I confuse the acetic acid concentration? Wait, the initial solution was 0.05 M acetic acid, but after dilution, it's 0.025 M.

So the moles at equivalence point are 0.001 mol, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the volume. Let me recheck. At equivalence point, the total volume is 40 +10=50 cm³=0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 /0.05=0.02 M.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem isn't in my calculations, but in the options. Because according to my correct calculations, pH at equivalence is around 9.02, but none of the options have this.

Wait, the options given are:

A) 4.26;8.52

B)3.17;6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92.

So none have 9.0. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution calculation.

Wait, wait wait. Alternative idea: Maybe the problem assumes that after dilution, the concentration is 0.0125 M, not 0.025 M. Let me redo the calculations with that assumption, even though I think that's incorrect.

If the initial diluted concentration is 0.0125 M, then moles after dilution is 0.0125 *0.04=0.0005 mol.

Equivalence point would require NaOH: 0.0005 /0.1=0.005 L=5 cm³.

pH at 25% titration: 25% of 5 cm³ is 1.25 cm³ added.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 *0.00125=0.000125 mol.

Moles of HA remaining: 0.0005 -0.000125=0.000375 mol.

Moles of A^-: 0.000125 mol.

Volume is 40 +1.25=41.25 cm³=0.04125 L.

Concentrations: [HA]=0.000375 /0.04125=0.00909 M.

[A^-]=0.000125 /0.04125=0.00303 M.

Ratio [A^-]/[HA]=0.00303/0.00909≈0.333.

pH=pKa + log(0.333)=4.733 -0.477=4.256≈4.26.

At equivalence point, moles of A^-: 0.0005 mol.

Volume:40 +5=45 cm³=0.045 L.

Concentration: 0.0005/0.045≈0.01111 M.

Kb=5.405e-10.

x²=0.01111 *5.405e-10=5.999e-12 → x=7.746e-6.

pOH=5.112 → pH=8.888.

But according to this, the equivalence pH is 8.89, which isn't in the options either. So this can't be the correct path.

Hmm. I'm getting confused here. Because according to the correct initial dilution (0.025 M), the equivalence point pH is around 9.02, which isn't an option. But if I incorrectly take the initial concentration as 0.0125 M, the equivalence point is around 8.89, which is close to option A's 8.52 but not exactly.

But since the initial calculation (correct dilution) gives pH=9.02, which is not in the options, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the initial volume is 20 cm³, and when diluted with 20 cm³, the volume is 40 cm³, so the concentration is 0.05 M * (20/40)=0.025 M. So I think this is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution at equivalence point is not only acetate but some other factor. Perhaps I'm forgetting activity coefficients or something else, but I don't think that's the case in this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I'm using Kb, but I should use another approach, like the formula for a weak base.

Another approach: The pH can be found using the formula:

pH = pKa + pKsp? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no. The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it hydrolyzes in water to produce OH^-.

The formula is correct. So I'm back to the same result.

Hmm. Another thought: Maybe the problem expects me to calculate the pH using the initial concentration before any titration, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, but the question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point. So I think my initial calculation for the 25% titration is correct (pH=4.26) and the equivalence point is around 9.02.

But looking at the options, option A's equivalence pH is 8.52, which is lower than 9. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recheck:

Ka=1.85e-5 → pKa=4.733.

Kw=1e-14 → Kb=1e-14/1.85e-5=5.405e-10.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps the solution after equivalence point isn't just the acetate hydrolysis. Could there be any other contribution? No, because at equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized, and the solution is just the acetate ion and water.

Hmm. So I'm getting stuck here. According to my calculations, the pH at equivalence point is around 9.02, but none of the options match this.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong initial concentration. Let me try the initial concentration as 0.0125 M again, even though I think it's incorrect.

So initial moles after dilution:0.0125 *0.04=0.0005 mol.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH=0.0005, so volume V=0.0005/0.1=0.005 L=5 cm³.

At equivalence point, acetate concentration is 0.0005 / (40+5)=0.0005 /45=0.00001111 M? No, wait, 0.0005 mol /0.045 L=0.01111 M.

Wait, same as before. Then the pH would be around 8.88, but option A's second value is 8.52, which is lower.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution's pH at equivalence point considers the dilution from adding NaOH as part of the volume.

No, I think that's accounted for in the volume calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it using the exact formula without approximations.

So for the equivalence point, exact expression:

x² = Kb * C → x²=5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5.

pH=14 -4.98=9.02.

Hmm. Well, perhaps the correct option isn't among the choices, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, another approach: Let me check the options again. Perhaps the equivalence point is around 8.88, but the closest option is A) 8.52. Hmm, that's a big difference.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles of NaOH used.

Wait, at equivalence point, moles of NaOH should be equal to moles of acetic acid. So if the initial acetic acid was 0.001 mol, then moles of NaOH is also 0.001 mol.

So volume of NaOH is 0.001 /0.1 =0.01 L=10 cm³.

Thus, in the equivalence point solution, the volume is 40 +10=50 cm³=0.05 L.

So acetate concentration is 0.001 /0.05=0.02 M.

Yes.

So perhaps the problem expects me to use a different approach, maybe the same as the initial calculation but with a different assumption.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem considers that after the equivalence point, excess OH- is present. But no, at equivalence point, all the H+ from the acid has been neutralized, so the solution is from the acetate hydrolysis only.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution at equivalence point is a buffer, but that's not correct because all the acid has been neutralized.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is a weak base, but I'm certain that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution is 0.02 M in acetate, but when calculating Kb, I should have used the exact value without approximation.

Wait, let's try without approximation.

x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is negligible compared to 0.02, but let's see. Let me compute x.

x² =5.405e-10 * (0.02 -x).

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x²=5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5.

As before. So the approximation holds.

So, I think the pH at equivalence point is about 9.02. But since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem didn't account for activity coefficients or assumes a different temperature. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use an approximate method for pH calculation, such as the simplified formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the way the dilution is done.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the initial solution's concentration is 0.05 M, and after adding 20 cm³, the volume is 40 cm³, so the new concentration is 0.025 M. So moles of acetic acid are 0.025 *0.04=0.001 mol.

Equivalence point requires 0.001 mol of NaOH. At 0.1 M, that's 10 cm³.

At 25% titration: 2.5 cm³ added.

Moles of NaOH added:0.1 *0.0025=0.00025 mol.

So moles of HA:0.001 -0.00025=0.00075 mol.

Moles of A^-:0.00025 mol.

Volume is 40 +2.5=42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

Concentration HA= 0.00075/0.0425≈0.017647 M.

Concentration A^- =0.00025/0.0425≈0.005882 M.

Ratio A^-/HA=0.005882/0.017647≈0.3333.

pH= pKa + log(0.3333)=4.733 -0.477=4.256≈4.26.

So first pH is 4.26.

At equivalence point, pH is 9.02, but none of the options match. So perhaps the problem has a mistake, but that's unlikely.

Looking at the options, the only one with pH 4.26 is option A, which has equivalence pH 8.52.

But according to my calculations, the equivalence pH is around 9.02. So perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb.

Wait, perhaps I should compute Kb again more accurately.

Ka =1.85e-5 → pKa=4.733.

Kb= Kw/Ka=1e-14 /1.85e-5 =5.405405e-10.

Yes.

So, assuming I'm correct with the pH at equivalence point being 9.02, but no option matches, perhaps the correct answer is not present. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution expects me to use the Henderson equation, but I can't see how that would apply at equivalence point.

Wait another thought: Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the solution at equivalence point is a buffer because some excess NaOH was added beyond equivalence. But no, 25% is before equivalence.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the calculation of the buffer pH. Let me check that again.

At 25% titration, the solution is a buffer. So pH=pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is 4.733.

[A^-]/[HA]= (0.00025/0.0425)/(0.00075/0.0425)=0.00025/0.00075=1/3.

So log(1/3)= -0.477.

So pH=4.733-0.477=4.256≈4.26. So pH at 25% is 4.26.

Which matches option A's first value.

But the equivalence pH is 9.02, which is not in the options. So perhaps the options are incorrect.

But among the options, option A has the correct first pH, but the wrong equivalence pH.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the initial dilution.

Wait, perhaps I should redo the initial calculation.

20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid: 0.05 *0.02=0.001 mol.

Diluted with 20 cm³, so 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 /0.04=0.025 M.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH added: 0.00025 mol.

So, moles HA=0.001 -0.00025=0.00075.

Moles A^-=0.00025.

Volume=42.5 cm³.

pH=4.26.

At equivalence, 10 cm³ added, volume=50 cm³.

Concentration of acetate=0.001 /0.05=0.02 M.

pH=9.02.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the initial dilution was 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid into 20 cm³ of NaOH. But no, the question says it's diluted with water.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong pKa.

Wait, given Ka=1.85e-5, pKa= log(1/(1.85e-5))=4.733.

Yes.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is that the problem expects the pH at equivalence point to be calculated assuming that the solution is a strong base, which is incorrect. But that would give pH=14 -0=14, which isn't present.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the pH at equivalence point to be calculated using the concentration of the sodium acetate as a weak base but using a different approach, like considering the ionization differently.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using the exact formula without approximation.

The exact expression for Kb is:

x² = Kb * C (0.02) → but without approximation, it's x²= Kb*(0.02 -x).

Assuming x is small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x²=5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 →x=1.04e-5.

So [OH-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

No, same result.

Hmm, I'm stuck. According to my calculations, the pH at 25% is 4.26, and at equivalence point is ~9.02.

Looking at the options, the only one that matches the 4.26 is option A.

Even though the equivalence pH is not matching, perhaps the intended correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the pH at equivalence point as 7.00, but that would only be the case if the solution is neutral, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the initial problem statement.

Wait, the problem states that we titrate the resulting solution (after dilution) with 0.1 M NaOH.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial concentration after dilution.

Let me recheck:

Volume of acetic acid:20 cm³=0.02 L.

Molarity:0.05 M → moles=0.05 *0.02=0.001 mol.

Added to 20 cm³ water → total volume=40 cm³=0.04 L.

Concentration=0.001 /0.04=0.025 M.

Correct.

So, the calculations are correct.

So, I'm thinking that perhaps the intended answer is option D: 4.57;6.92. But why?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps when you dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the concentration is halved, so 0.025 M. So the initial concentration is 0.025 M.

But when titrating, the moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol, so equivalence point requires 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ added.

So moles of NaOH:0.1 *0.0025=0.00025.

Moles of HA:0.001-0.00025=0.00075.

Moles of A^-:0.00025.

Volume:42.5 cm³.

Concentration HA:0.00075 /0.0425=0.017647 M.

Concentration A^-:0.00025 /0.0425=0.005882 M.

Ratio:0.005882/0.017647=0.3333.

pH= pKa + log(1/3)=4.733 -0.477=4.256≈4.26.

At equivalence point:

Molarity of A^-:0.001 /0.05=0.02 M.

pH=9.02.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation but with a different assumption, like activity or considering the solution is not at 25% but a different point.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the pH at the halfway point, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the pH at 25% of the initial volume, not 25% of the equivalence.

Wait, 25% of the initial volume: 25% of 40 cm³ is 10 cm³. But that's not relevant here.

Hmm. I'm stuck.

In the given options, the only one with pH of 4.26 is option A, which has equivalence pH of 8.52.

But according to my calculations, equivalence pH is 9.02.

So perhaps the correct answer isn't present, but more likely, I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that after adding 25% of the NaOH solution, the solution's pH is calculated differently.

Wait, another approach: Let me calculate the pH at 25% of the NaOH needed to reach equivalence, which is 2.5 cm³.

So, in the buffer solution, I have:

n(HA) =0.00075 mol.

n(A^-)=0.00025 mol.

Volume=42.5 cm³.

So, using Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH= pKa + log( (0.00025)/(0.00075) )=4.733 + log(1/3)≈4.733-0.477=4.256.

So, pH=4.26.

At equivalence point:

n(A^-)=0.001 mol.

Volume=50 cm³.

Concentration=0.02 M.

pH=9.02.

But the options don't include this.

Hmm. Since none of the options match, perhaps I should reevaluate the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the initial solution is 0.05 M acetic acid, and when 20 cm³ is added to 20 cm³ water, the total volume is 40 cm³, making concentration 0.025 M. So, moles are 0.025 *0.04=0.001 mol.

Now, when titrating, the equivalence point is at 10 cm³.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ added, so 0.00025 mol of NaOH.

So, moles HA=0.001 -0.00025=0.00075.

Moles A^-=0.00025.

Volume=42.5 cm³.

pH=4.26.

At equivalence point, pH=9.02.

Since none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is not provided, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the given options and choose the best fit.

In that case, the 4.26 matches option A's first value, but the equivalence point is way off.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point pH.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact formula for a weak base without approximation.

The equation is:

x² = Kb*(C -x) → x²=5.405e-10*(0.02 -x).

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02 → x²=5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 →x=1.04e-5.

So [OH-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

So, no, the calculation is correct.

Given that, I'm forced to conclude that the correct pH values are 4.26 and 9.02. Since these aren't in the options, perhaps the problem intended different initial concentrations.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial acetic acid solution was 20 cm³ of 0.1 M, but that's not what the question states.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the problem is not considering that the solution at equivalence point is a weak base, but instead, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to use 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid diluted with 20 cm³ of NaOH, but that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the initial concentration is 0.1 M, but that's not what's stated.

In the absence of further insights, I'll proceed under the assumption that the correct pH at 25% is 4.26, which matches option A, but the equivalence point pH is 9.02, which doesn't match any option.

But looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles.

Wait, wait wait. Wait, 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is 0.001 mol.

Diluted to 40 cm³, so 0.001 /0.04=0.025 M.

At 25% titration, adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH gives 0.00025 mol of OH-.

So, moles HA:0.001 -0.00025=0.00075.

Moles A^-:0.00025.

pH=4.26.

At equivalence point, 10 cm³ added, 0.001 mol of NaOH.

pH=9.02.

But none of the options have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution after equivalence point isn't just acetate, but considering something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the pH at 25% of the initial solution's volume, but I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is 0.05 M acetic acid, not 0.025 M. So, initial concentration as 0.05 M.

In that case, moles after dilution is 0.05 *0.04=0.002 mol.

Equivalence point would be 0.002/0.1=0.02 L=20 cm³.

At 25% titration, 5 cm³ added.

Moles NaOH:0.1 *0.005=0.0005 mol.

Moles HA:0.002 -0.0005=0.0015.

Moles A^-:0.0005.

Volume=40 +5=45 cm³=0.045 L.

Concentrations:

HA:0.0015 /0.045=0.03333 M.

A^-:0.0005/0.045=0.01111 M.

Ratio: 0.01111/0.03333=0.333.

pH=4.733 -0.477=4.256≈4.26.

At equivalence point, moles of A^-:0.002 mol.

Volume=40 +20=60 cm³=0.06 L.

Concentration=0.002/0.06≈0.03333 M.

Kb=5.405e-10.

x²=5.405e-10 *0.03333=1.799e-11 → x=4.24e-6.

pOH=5.37 → pH=8.63.

Now, this would give pH at equivalence point of approximately 8.63.

Which is close to option A's 8.52, but not exact.

So, with initial concentration of 0.05 M, the pH at 25% is 4.26 and at equivalence point is 8.63.

So, closest option would be option A:4.26; 8.52.

But then, why is the initial concentration 0.05 M after dilution? Because the problem says "dilute 20.00 cm³ 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ water". So the initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the solution is 0.05 M, not 0.025 M. Because 20 cm³ of 0.05 M diluted with 20 cm³ of something else.

Wait, but the problem says "dilute 20.00 cm³ 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ water". So total volume is 40 cm³, so concentration is 0.025 M.

Oh, but perhaps I should not have added the volumes correctly. Oh wait, no, 20 +20=40 cm³.

But if the problem had said "diluted to 20 cm³", then the concentration would be 0.1 M, but that's not the case.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck, and I have to make a choice based on the given options. The only option that matches the pH at 25% is option A, which has 4.26 as the first value. But its equivalence pH is 8.52, which is lower than what I calculated.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the pH at equivalence point using the formula for a weak base, but with a different approach.

Wait, let me try to calculate it again.

At equivalence point:

[CH3COO^-] =0.02 M.

Kb=5.405e-10.

The formula is:

[OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11)= 1.04e-5.

pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

This is correct.

So perhaps the problem has a mistake, but given the options, the best fit is option A:4.26;8.52, but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that the solution at equivalence point is 0.02 M in acetate and use the formula pH= pKa2 + log C, but that's not applicable.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the same pKa for the equivalence point, but that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation at equivalence point, but that's not applicable because there's no HA left.

I think I've spent a lot of time on this and need to proceed. The pH at 25% is 4.26, which is option A. The equivalence pH I calculated is 9.02, but the closest option is A's 8.52.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct equivalence pH is 8.52.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the Kb.

Wait, Kb=1e-14/(1.85e-5)= 5.405e-10.

But perhaps I should use the exact value without approximation for the pH.

Wait, perhaps using the exact formula:

[OH-]=√(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02)= sqrt(1.081e-11)= 1.04e-5.

pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

No, same result.

Hmm.

Given that, I'll have to select the option that matches the 25% pH, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first calculate the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The problem states that 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a total volume of 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula:

\[
C_2 = \frac{C_1 \cdot V_1}{V_2}
\]

\[
C_2 = \frac{0.05 \cdot 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

The moles of acetic acid after dilution are:

\[
n_{\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}} = C_2 \cdot V_2 = 0.025 \cdot 0.04 = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
n_{\text{NaOH}} = 0.25 \cdot 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
n_{\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ions formed are:

\[
n_{\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume at this point is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ions are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \( K_a = 1.85 \times 10^{-5} \), so:

\[
\text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733.
\]

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

### At Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, and the solution contains only acetate ions. The moles of acetate ions are:

\[
n_{\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume at the equivalence point is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion acts as a weak base in water, and its \( K_b \) is calculated as:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the formula for the hydrolysis of acetate:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{C - x},
\]

where \( x = [\text{OH}^-] \), and assuming \( x \ll C \), we approximate:

\[
K_b \cdot C = x^2 \implies x = \sqrt{K_b \cdot C}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02)} = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A (4.26; 8.52):** The pH at 25% titration matches (4.26), but the pH at equivalence point (8.52) does not match the calculated value (9.02).
- **Option B (3.17; 6.73):** Neither the pH at 25% titration nor the equivalence point matches.
- **Option C (4.73; 7.00):** Neither the pH at 25% titration nor the equivalence point matches.
- **Option D (4.57; 6.92):** Neither the pH at 25% titration nor the equivalence point matches.

The calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, which matches Option A. However, the calculated pH at equivalence point (9.02) does not match any of the given options. Despite this discrepancy, Option A is the closest match based on the pH at 25% titration.

ANSWER: A
