Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding an eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

Alright, the operator is P, and it's for a muon. The direction is an arbitrary vector n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're interested in is +ħ/2. I remember that eigenvectors satisfy the equation P|ψ> = λ|ψ>, where λ is the eigenvalue.

Wait, but the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, P_z. So the operator P must be the sum of these components multiplied by their respective directions, right? Oh wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, the operator along an arbitrary direction n would be P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Because the operator in direction n is the sum of components times their direction cosines.

Wait, but the problem says the direction is in the x-z plane. So that means the direction vector n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). Because y-component is zero. So n is along x-z plane. So the operator P is n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because n_y is zero.

But wait, the problem says the operator is along an "arbitrary direction n" in the x-z plane. So the eigenvector would depend on the direction n, but the options given don't seem to involve any angles, except option B and C which have theta and phi. Hmm.

Wait, but the question is to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the operator is P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Let me write down the matrices for each component.

P_x is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix with first row [0, 1], second row [1, 0]. So P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]], and P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So the operator P in the direction n is P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because n is in x-z plane, so n_y is zero.

So let's write P as:

P = n_x (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me factor out (ħ/2):

P = (ħ/2) [n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix inside:

The matrix will have elements:

Top-left: n_z * 1

Top-right: n_x * 1

Bottom-left: n_x * 1

Bottom-right: -n_z *1

So the matrix is:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The P_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when we multiply by n_x and P_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]] multiplied by n_z.

So adding them:

The (1,1) element is n_z *1 (from P_z) and 0 from P_x. So it's n_z.

The (1,2) element is n_x *1 (from P_x), because P_x has 1 in (1,2) and (2,1), and P_z's off-diagonal is zero.

Similarly, (2,1) is n_x.

(2,2) is -n_z.

So the matrix inside is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

So then the operator P is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

So, the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v> .

Wait, because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So (P - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0.

So the matrix of P - (ħ/2) I is:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] - (ħ/2) I = (ħ/2) [ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z - 1] ].

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so when multiplied by ħ/2, it's [[ħ/2, 0], [0, ħ/2]]. So subtracting that, each element is:

For the (1,1) element: (n_z * ħ/2) - (ħ/2) = (n_z -1) * ħ/2.

Similarly, (1,2): (n_x * ħ/2) - 0 = n_x * ħ/2.

(2,1): same as (1,2).

(2,2): (-n_z * ħ/2) - (ħ/2) = (-n_z -1) * ħ/2.

So the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1] ]

To find the eigenvectors, we set the determinant of (P - λ I) to zero. So the determinant of the matrix should be zero.

Wait, but in our case, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so we've already subtracted that. Therefore, the determinant of [n_z -1, n_x; n_x, -n_z -1] multiplied by (ħ/2)^2 should be zero.

So let's compute the determinant:

(n_z -1)(-n_z -1) - (n_x)^2 = 0.

Expand this:

(-n_z^2 -n_z + n_z +1 ) - n_x^2 = 0.

Wait, let me compute (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) = -(n_z -1)(n_z +1) = -(n_z^2 -1) = -n_z^2 +1.

So the equation becomes:

(-n_z^2 +1) - n_x^2 =0 → 1 -n_z^2 -n_x^2 =0.

But since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. So substituting that, we get 1- (n_z^2 +n_x^2 )=1-1=0. So the equation is satisfied, which is correct because we're already considering the eigenvalue.

So now, to find the eigenvectors, we can write the equation (P - (ħ/2)I)|v> =0.

So the matrix equation is:

[ (n_z -1) (n_x) ] [a]   = 0
[ (n_x)     (-n_z -1) ] [b]

So the equations are:

(n_z -1)a + n_x b =0,

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0.

Let me write the first equation:

(n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

Assuming (n_z -1) is not zero. But wait, if n_z is 1, then the denominator would be zero. So n_z can't be 1, because that would make the operator P have +ħ/2 as an eigenvalue. Hmm, but in general, I think n is arbitrary except when it's along z.

Wait, but for a general direction in x-z, n_z can vary from -1 to +1.

So, assuming n_z != 1, we can proceed.

So a = (-n_x / (n_z -1)) b.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ a; b ] = [ (-n_x/(n_z-1)) b, b ].

We can factor out b, so the vector is proportional to [ -n_x/(n_z -1), 1 ].

Alternatively, we can write it as (n_x, (n_z -1)) multiplied by some factor. Wait, wait, let me see:

Suppose I take b = (n_z -1), then a = -n_x.

So the vector is [ -n_x, n_z -1 ].

But wait, this is an eigenvector, but it's not normalized. Since we're looking for a normalized eigenvector, we'll have to normalize it.

But wait, let's see: the eigenvector is |v> = [a, b]^T. So in terms of components, it's a column vector with a and b.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of spin-1/2 systems. Because P is similar to the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, the operator P is given as P = n_x P_x +n_z P_z. Wait, but wait, is the direction n along x-z or do we need to consider it as (n_x, n_y, n_z), but in this case, n_y is zero.

Wait, but in spin systems, the spin operator in direction n is S·n = S_x n_x + S_y n_y + S_z n_z.

So the eigenstates of S·n are the spin-up and spin-down states along that direction. So the eigenvectors are the eigenstates along n, which are given in terms of the angles theta and phi.

But in the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is a standard spin-1/2 eigenstate for spin-up along z (theta=0), but that's when theta is the polar angle in the standard spherical coordinate system.

Wait, but in our case, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so the polar angle theta would be measured from the z-axis, and phi is zero since it's in x-z plane.

Wait, but let me think again. The state for spin-up along direction n (which is in x-z plane) would be expressed as a combination of |+z> and |–z> states.

In the standard notation, |+n> is given by:

|+n> = cos(theta/2) |+z> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |–z>

But since in our problem, the direction is in x-z plane, phi is zero. So the state becomes cos(theta/2) |+z> + sin(theta/2) |–z>.

So the components would be [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Wait, but wait, is theta the polar angle? Let me think: in spherical coordinates, theta is the angle from the positive z-axis, and phi is the azimuthal angle. Since our direction is in the x-z plane, phi=0.

So the spin-up state along n would be |+n> = cos(theta/2) |+z> + e^{i 0} sin(theta/2) |–z> = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

So this would correspond to option C, which is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is exactly what I have here. So the normalized eigenvector would have components like that.

Wait, but let's verify this with the matrix approach. Let's set n_x = sin(theta) and n_z = cos(theta), because in the x-z plane, the polar angle theta would have x as sin(theta) and z as cos(theta). So with phi=0, direction vector is (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)).

Wait, actually, no, because in spherical coordinates, the direction vector is (sin(theta) cos(phi), sin(theta) sin(phi), cos(theta)). Since phi=0 here, it becomes (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)).

So n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta).

So the matrix for P is (ħ/2) * [ [cos(theta), sin(theta)], [sin(theta), -cos(theta)] ].

The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the matrix (P - (ħ/2) I) is:

(ħ/2)[ [cos(theta) -1, sin(theta) ],
          [sin(theta), -cos(theta) -1 ] ]

The determinant is zero, as we saw before.

The eigenvector equations:

[ (cos(theta)-1 ) a + sin(theta) b ] = 0,

[ sin(theta) a + (-cos(theta)-1 ) b ] = 0.

Let me take the first equation:

(cos(theta) -1) a + sin(theta) b =0 → a = [ - sin(theta) / (cos(theta) -1) ] b.

But cos(theta) -1 = -(1 - cos(theta)) = -2 sin^2(theta/2).

And sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So substituting:

a = [ - (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) / ( -2 sin^2(theta/2) ) ) ] b → the negatives cancel, and 2 cancels.

So a = [ (sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) / ( sin^2(theta/2) ) ) ] b → a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b → a = cot(theta/2) b.

So, the vector is [ a, b ] = [ cot(theta/2) b, b ].

We can factor out b, so [cot(theta/2), 1 ].

But to normalize this vector, let's compute the normalization factor.

The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

So (cot(theta/2))^2 |b|^2 + |b|^2 =1 → |b|^2 [ cot^2(theta/2) + 1 ] =1.

But cot^2 +1 = csc^2 → so |b|= sin(theta/2).

Because csc(theta/2) = 1/sin(theta/2), so |b|=1/sqrt(csc^2(theta/2)) ) → wait, let me compute.

cot^2 +1 = csc^2 → so |b| * sqrt( csc^2 ) =1 → |b| csc(theta/2) =1 → |b|= sin(theta/2).

So a= cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] * sin(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Which matches option C.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Yes, that's the same as our result.

So the answer must be option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as matrices scaled by $\hbar/2$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the operator $\vec{P}$ simplifies to $P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $n_x$ and $n_z$ are the components of the unit vector $\vec{n}$.

### Key Steps:
1. **Matrix Representation of $\vec{P}$**:  
   Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the operator $P$ becomes:
   \[
   P = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix}
   n_z & n_x \\
   n_x & -n_z
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalue Equation**:  
   The eigenvalue equation is $P |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle$, where $|v\rangle$ is the eigenvector. Subtracting $\frac{\hbar}{2} I$ from $P$, the matrix equation becomes:
   \[
   \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix}
   n_z - 1 & n_x \\
   n_x & -n_z - 1
   \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
   a \\
   b
   \end{bmatrix} = 0,
   \]
   where $|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$.

3. **Solving for Eigenvector Components**:  
   The equations derived from the matrix are:
   \[
   (n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0, \quad n_x a + (-n_z - 1)b = 0.
   \]
   Solving these, we find $a = -\frac{n_x}{n_z - 1} b$. Substituting $n_x = \sin(\theta)$ and $n_z = \cos(\theta)$ (since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane), the eigenvector components become proportional to $[\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2)]$.

4. **Normalization**:  
   The eigenvector is normalized to ensure $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$. After normalization, the components of the eigenvector are:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos(\theta/2) \\
   \sin(\theta/2)
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

5. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing with the given options, the normalized eigenvector matches **Option C**, which is $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.

### Final Answer:
The normalized eigenvector is $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$, corresponding to **Option C**.
