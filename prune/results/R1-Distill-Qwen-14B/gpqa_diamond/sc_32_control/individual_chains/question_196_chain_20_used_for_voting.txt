Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, harmonic oscillators, right. I remember that in the classical case, a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement, F = -kx. But wait, this question is about a relativistic version, so I guess special relativity comes into play here. Oh right, because when velocities get close to the speed of light, relativistic effects become significant.

The question asks for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me think through this step by step.

In a classical harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², where A is the amplitude. So the kinetic energy at maximum speed is (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal: (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA², which simplifies to v_max² = (kA²)/m, so v_max = sqrt(kA²/m) = A*sqrt(k/m). So that's the classical case.

But this is a relativistic oscillator. So I can't use the classical formulas anymore because they don't hold at high velocities. Instead, I need to consider relativistic mechanics, particularly the relativistic expressions for energy and momentum.

In special relativity, the total energy E of a particle is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², where p is the momentum. Also, the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy: KE = E - mc² = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 ) - mc².

For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy has a relativistic form. At maximum speed, all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, but with relativistic considerations.

Wait, but wait. In the relativistic case, the energy isn't just kinetic. The total energy includes rest mass energy. Oh, but the problem is about the maximum speed, so perhaps the approach is to consider when the potential energy is at maximum, and the kinetic energy is maximum as well.

Wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is maximum when x is at maximum (x=A), so the kinetic energy is zero there. And when x is zero, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. So in the relativistic case, when x=0, the velocity is maximum. So the kinetic energy at that point is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

But wait, the total energy of the oscillator would have to account for the system's energy. Hmm, perhaps I should model the energy of the oscillator as the sum of potential and kinetic energies, but with relativistic adjustments.

Alternatively, perhaps the system's total energy is conserved, and we can write expressions for the maximum kinetic energy as a function of the amplitude.

Let me try to think about the energy in this scenario. The total mechanical energy E of the oscillator in the classical case is (1/2)kA². But in the relativistic case, the energy would be higher because of the gamma factor.

Wait, but maybe the potential energy in the relativistic case is still (1/2)kA², but the kinetic energy is relativistic. However, I'm not certain about that. Alternatively, perhaps the force is still F = -kx, but the motion is governed by relativistic momentum considerations.

Hmm. Let me think in terms of force and momentum. Newton's second law in relativistic terms is F = dp/dt, where p is the relativistic momentum, p = gamma m v. So F = d/dt (gamma m v).

But since F = -kx, we can relate the acceleration. Wait, but this might complicate things. Maybe instead of directly dealing with force, I can think about the energy.

In the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy as a function of position is U(x) = (1/2)k x². The kinetic energy K is a function of velocity. The total energy E is U + K.

At the maximum amplitude x = A, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero, and E = (1/2)k A². At x = 0, the velocity is maximum, and all the energy is kinetic.

Wait, but in the classical case, yes. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy can't be larger than (gamma - 1)mc². Wait, no, because K = (gamma -1) mc². But that's when the particle is moving at speed v, so gamma depends on v.

So, when the oscillator is at x=0, the kinetic energy is maximum. So the total energy E is (1/2)k A². So, (1/2)k A² = K_max + U_max. Wait, no, at x=0, U is zero, so E = K_max.

Wait, no, that would imply that E = K_max. But the total energy is E = K_max = (1/2)k A².

But in the relativistic case, K_max = (gamma_max - 1) mc². So,

(1/2)k A² = (gamma_max -1) mc².

So, solving for gamma_max:

gamma_max = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But wait, let me check the units. k has units of N/m, which is kg/s². So, k A² has units kg/s² * m² = kg m²/s² = (kg m²/s²)/m, which is N·m, but wait, let's compute (k A²)/(m c²). k A² is (kg/s²)*m² = kg m²/s². Dividing by m c² (kg m²/s²) gives dimensionless, which is correct because gamma is unitless.

So,

gamma_max = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

Wait, but gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)), so gamma_max = 1/sqrt(1 - (v_max^2/c^2)).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v_max^2/c^2)) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Hmm, but wait, the equation I have is:

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Wait, that can't be right if (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) is large, because gamma would be larger than 1, but the right approach would be to set E = K_max.

Wait, maybe I got this wrong. Let's re-examine.

In the classical case, E = (1/2)k A^2 = (1/2) m v_max^2.

But in the relativistic case, E would be the total energy, which is gamma m c^2.

At x=0, the potential energy is zero, so all energy is kinetic, but wait, no, wait. The total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. Wait, no, the total energy in the system includes the potential energy. So, in the classical case, E = (1/2)k A^2, and at x=0, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v_max^2, which equals (1/2)k A^2.

In the relativistic scenario, the energy of the oscillator isn't just the sum of potential and kinetic in the same way. Wait, perhaps the potential energy is (1/2)k x^2, and the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c^2. So, the total energy E is (gamma -1) m c^2 + (1/2)k x^2.

At maximum displacement x = A, the velocity is zero, so gamma is 1, so kinetic energy K is zero, and E = (1/2)k A^2. At x=0, x^2 is zero, so all energy is kinetic, so E = (gamma -1) m c^2.

So,

(1/2)k A^2 = (gamma -1) m c^2.

Solving for gamma:

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

gamma = [ (k A^2) / (2 m c^2) ) ] + 1.

But gamma is equal to 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) as a term, say, alpha. So,

gamma = 1 + alpha.

Rearranging:

1 - v_max^2/c^2 = 1/(gamma^2) = 1/( (1 + alpha)^2 ).

So,

v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, 1 = (1 + alpha)^2/(1 + alpha)^2.

So,

1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 = [ (1 + alpha)^2 -1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Expanding (1 + alpha)^2: 1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So numerator is 1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2 - 1 = 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So,

v_max^2/c^2 = (2 alpha + alpha^2) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Factor numerator: alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm. Simplify:

v_max^2 = c^2 * [alpha (2 + alpha)] / (1 + alpha)^2.

But alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Plugging back in,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ (k A^2 / (2 m c^2)) * (2 + (k A^2 / (2 m c^2)) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) )^2 ]

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Let me see if I can simplify it.

Let me factor out (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) from the numerator and denominator.

Wait, let me denote beta = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ beta (2 + beta) ] / (1 + beta)^2.

Multiply numerator:

beta (2 + beta) = 2 beta + beta^2.

Denominator: (1 + beta)^2 = 1 + 2 beta + beta^2.

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ (2 beta + beta^2) ] / [ (1 + 2 beta + beta^2) ].

Hmm, perhaps factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, numerator: beta (2 + beta).

Denominator: (1 + beta)^2.

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ beta (2 + beta) ] / (1 + beta)^2.

Let me write this as c^2 * [ beta (beta + 2) ] / (beta + 1)^2.

Hmm, but I'm not sure this helps. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to express this in terms of a square or something else.

Wait, let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - kA^2/(2 m c^2) )).

Wait, the denominator inside the square root is 1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2). So, 1 - x, where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

But earlier, we have v^2 in terms of beta, where beta is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2), which is the same as x.

So, let me compute the square of v_max.

From our earlier expression,

v_max^2 = (c^2) * [ beta (2 + beta) ] / (1 + beta)^2.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ beta (2 + beta) ] / (1 + beta)^2 )

= c * sqrt( beta (2 + beta) ) / (1 + beta )

Hmm, but perhaps, let's try to rearrange the equation.

Wait, another approach: from gamma = 1 + beta, and gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

So,

gamma = 1 + beta.

So,

1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + beta.

Squaring both sides,

1/(1 - v^2/c^2) = (1 + beta)^2.

So,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + beta)^2.

Which gives,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + beta)^2.

So,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + beta)^2 )

= c sqrt( ( (1 + beta)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + beta)^2 )

= c sqrt( (1 + 2 beta + beta^2 -1 ) / (1 + beta)^2 )

= c sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2 ) / (1 + beta)^2 )

= c * sqrt( beta (2 + beta) ) / (1 + beta )

Hmm, not sure if this is helpful.

Wait, let me compute beta (2 + beta) over (1 + beta)^2.

beta (2 + beta) = 2 beta + beta^2.

(1 + beta)^2 = 1 + 2 beta + beta^2.

So,

(2 beta + beta^2)/(1 + 2 beta + beta^2) = [ beta (beta + 2) ] / [ (beta +1)^2 ]

Wait, but perhaps I can factor or find a common term.

Alternatively, maybe I can factor the numerator and denominator.

Wait, the denominator is (beta +1)^2, and the numerator is beta (beta + 2).

Hmm, not seeing a clear simplification here.

Alternatively, perhaps in terms of gamma.

Wait, from gamma =1 + beta, beta = gamma -1.

So, substituting beta = gamma -1 into the expression:

v^2/c^2 = (gamma -1) (2 + gamma -1 ) / (gamma)^2

= (gamma -1)(gamma + 1) / gamma^2

= (gamma^2 - 1) / gamma^2

= 1 - 1/gamma^2,

which brings us back to the earlier expression. So, that's a check that the algebra is consistent.

Hmm, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the options again.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)) )

Wait, let me compute the expression inside the square root.

Inside the square root, 1 + 1/(1 - x), where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Compute 1 + [1/(1-x)].

= [ (1 -x) + 1 ] / (1 -x)

= (2 - x )/(1 -x )

So, sqrt( (2 - x )/(1 -x) ) ) * c.

Hmm, but our earlier expression for v_max was sqrt[ (beta (2 + beta) ) ] / (1 + beta) ) * c.

Wait, let's compute beta: beta = x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

beta (2 + beta) = x (2 + x).

(1 + beta)^2 = (1 + x)^2.

So, v_max = c * sqrt( x (2 +x) ) / (1 + x )

= c * sqrt( (x (2 +x) ) ) / (1+x )

= c * sqrt( x (2 +x) ) / (1 + x )

Hmm, not matching any of the options directly.

Looking at the options again:

Option B says sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - x)), which is sqrt( (2 -x)/(1 -x) ) as I found earlier.

Hmm, not matching what I have.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)))^2 )

Wait, in my earlier expression, I have v_max = c * sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2) ) / (1 + beta)^2.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me compute 1 - [1/(1 + beta)^2 ].

Which is ( (1+beta)^2 - 1 )/ (1+beta)^2.

Which is (1 + 2 beta + beta^2 -1 ) / denominator.

= (2 beta + beta^2) / denominator.

So, v_max^2 = c^2 * (2 beta + beta^2) / (1 + beta)^2.

Wait, 2 beta + beta^2 is beta (2 + beta).

Hmm, not seeing it. Let's think about the options.

Option D: sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + x )^2 ), where x is (k A^2/(2 m c^2)).

So, the square root would give sqrt( [ (1 + x)^2 - 1 ] / (1+ x)^2 )

= sqrt( [ (1 + 2x + x² ) -1 ] ) / (1 + x )

= sqrt( 2x + x² ) / (1 + x )

So, v_max = c * sqrt( x (2 + x) ) / (1 + x )

Which is exactly what I have for v_max.

So, option D is:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2)))^2 )

Which is exactly what we've derived.

Wait, let me compute the inside of the square root in option D.

Inside the sqrt: 1 - [1/(1 + x )^2 ] where x= (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So, 1 - 1/(1 +x )^2 = [ (1 +x )^2 - 1 ] / (1 +x )^2.

Which is (1 + 2x + x² -1 ) / (1 +x )^2.

= (2x + x² ) / (1+x )^2.

So, sqrt( (2x +x² )/( (1+x)^2 )) ) = sqrt( x (2 +x ) )/(1 +x )

Which is what we have for v_max.

So, option D matches.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the options again.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2)))^2 )

Which is exactly as we found. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check.

I think earlier, when I set E = (1/2)kA², which is the classical total energy.

But in the relativistic case, perhaps the total energy isn't (1/2)kA². Because the potential energy U(x) = (1/2)k x², but the kinetic energy is relativistic. So, the total energy E = (gamma -1) mc² + (1/2)k x².

Wait, but when x = A, gamma is 1, so E = (1/2) k A².

But when x = 0, all energy is kinetic, so E = (gamma_max -1) mc².

So,

(1/2)k A² = (gamma_max -1 ) mc².

Which leads to gamma_max = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then, v_max is related to gamma_max via gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

gamma_max = 1/(sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²)).

Which gives,

1 - v_max²/c² = 1/(gamma_max)^2.

So,

v_max²/c² = 1 - 1/(gamma_max)^2.

= (gamma_max² -1 ) / gamma_max².

But gamma_max is 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) = 1 + x, where x = (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v_max²/c² = [ (1 +x )^2 -1 ]/(1 +x )^2.

= (1 +2x +x² -1 )/(1 +x )^2.

= (2x +x²)/(1 +x )^2.

Which is x (2 +x ) / (1 +x )^2.

So,

v_max = c sqrt( x (2 +x ) )/(1 +x )

Which is the same as option D.

Yes, so the correct answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the energy conservation in the relativistic regime.

In the relativistic case, the total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is the sum of its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the potential energy is \( U = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and the kinetic energy is zero because the velocity is zero. At \( x = 0 \), the velocity is maximum, and the total energy is entirely kinetic. Thus, the total energy is:

\[
E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( v \) is the velocity of the mass. Solving for \( \gamma \), we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

The Lorentz factor is also related to the velocity by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( \gamma \), we have:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches the expression given in **Option D**. The other options are incorrect because they either misrepresent the relativistic energy relationship or fail to account for the proper form of the Lorentz factor.

**Answer: D**
