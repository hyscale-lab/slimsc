Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives a density matrix ρ as (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). And the options are different vectors in a 3D space, which I guess correspond to the Bloch sphere representation.

Wait, right, density matrices are used in quantum mechanics to describe the state of a system, especially when it's mixed (so not a pure state). The density matrix for a pure state would have a trace of 1, and for a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture.

Looking at ρ, it's (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me compute this. Each term |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| are projectors. So when I add them and multiply by 1/2, what does that give me?

Oh wait, |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 in the (0,0) position and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 in (1,1). Adding them together gives a 2x2 identity matrix. Then multiply by 1/2, so the resulting matrix is [[0.5, 0],[0,0.5]]. That's the density matrix.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position of this state in the qubit space. Qubit states are often represented on the Bloch sphere, which is a way to visualize quantum states.

Wait, the Bloch sphere is for pure states. But this ρ is a mixed state because it's a convex combination of |0⟩ and |1⟩. So for a mixed state, the density matrix is a statistical mixture, and its representation isn't a single point on the Bloch sphere but usually in the interior.

The density matrix for a pure state |θ⟩ would be |θ⟩⟨θ|, which can be written in terms of the Bloch vector r. The formula for the density matrix in terms of r is (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and I is the identity matrix.

So if we have ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, then for our given ρ, which is (I)/2, that would imply r·σ is zero. Because (I + 0)/2 is I/2. So r must be zero vector because otherwise, r·σ would add terms.

Wait, let me check. So if ρ is (I)/2, then that would mean that the density matrix is in the center, because any Bloch vector r would trace a path on the sphere, but if r=0, the density matrix is the completely mixed state.

So in the Bloch sphere, the completely mixed state (which is what this is) is at the origin, because the Bloch vector has magnitude 1 for pure states, but mixed states are inside. So the position r would be (0,0,0), which is option C.

Let me double-check. The density matrix for the mixed state is ρ = p|0⟩⟨0| + (1-p)|1⟩⟨1|. In our case, p is 1/2 for both |0⟩ and |1⟩. So it's a completely mixed state, which corresponds to the maximally mixed state in 2x2 systems. The maximally mixed state is indeed the one represented by the zero vector on the Bloch sphere because it's equally likely to be in either state, so no direction is favored. 

Therefore, the geometrical position should be at the origin of the Bloch sphere, which is option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, as it is a convex combination of the projectors \(\left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right|\) and \(\left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right|\). The resulting matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. This is the maximally mixed state for a qubit.

In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are represented as points on the surface of the sphere, while mixed states are represented inside the sphere. The Bloch vector \(r\) for a density matrix \(\rho\) is related to the Pauli matrices \(\sigma = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) by the formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{r \cdot \sigma}{2}.
\]

For the given \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\), the term \(r \cdot \sigma\) must vanish, which implies that \(r = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is located at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the geometrical position of \(\rho\) in the qubit space is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).
