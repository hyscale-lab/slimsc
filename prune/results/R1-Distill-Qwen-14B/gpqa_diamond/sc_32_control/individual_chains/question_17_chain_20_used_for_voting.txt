Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also give me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The Ca-EDTA complex is probably a stable complex because the K is so large. Wait, K is the formation constant, right? So the bigger the K, the more stable the complex.

The problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. Stoichiometric usually means the molar ratio is 1:1, I think. So the Ca-EDTA complex would dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. But wait, in solution, the EDTA is usually in different forms because of the pH. Oh wait, the pH is ideal, so maybe I don't have to worry about the different protonated forms of EDTA. Maybe I can treat it as a simple equilibrium.

Wait, the formula for the formation constant. Formation constant, Kf, is given by the equation [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Since the K is so big, the complex is very stable, so the concentration of free Ca²+ and EDTA should be really low.

But wait, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration is 0.02 M. Let me set up an ICE table maybe.

Let me think: when the complex dissociates a little, it forms Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. But since K is so large, the dissociation is minimal. Let me denote the change as 'x'. So:

Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-
Initial: 0.02 M, 0, 0
Change: -x, +x, +x
Equilibrium: 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is tiny because K is large)
So [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x.

Wait, but wait a second. EDTA usually has multiple protons, so in solution, it's in various forms. But the problem says pH is ideal, so maybe they're assuming all the EDTA is in the form that can bind Ca²+? Or perhaps the alpha fraction is 1, meaning only EDTA^4- is present. Oh, right, when pH is high enough, EDTA is deprotonated to EDTA^4-. So assuming that, the concentration of EDTA^4- is what's relevant.

So putting it all together, the equilibrium expression is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-}) = 5e10.

We have [Ca-EDTA] ≈ 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x.

So substituting into K:

5e10 = (0.02)/(x * x) → 5e10 = 0.02/(x²)

Solving for x²: x² = 0.02/(5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) *1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → x² =4e-13?

Wait, wait, let me compute that correctly.

0.02 is 2e-2. Divide that by 5e10: 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12.

So x squared is 0.4e-12 → x is sqrt(0.4e-12). Let's compute that.

sqrt(0.4) is about 0.632. sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6. So 0.632e-6 → 6.32e-7.

Wait, so x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. That would be the concentration of Ca²+.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7, which matches this value.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I get the setup right? The initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex. The K is 5e10. The assumption is that x is very small, so the complex concentration remains approximately 0.02.

Yes, because K is so large, the dissociation is minimal. So the calculation should be correct.

So the concentration of Ca²+ is about 6.3e-7 M. So the answer should be C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation equilibrium is:

\[
\text{Ca-EDTA} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

### Step 1: Define the equilibrium concentrations
- Initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex: \([ \text{Ca-EDTA} ]_0 = 0.02 \, \text{M}\).
- Let the dissociation of the complex release \(x\) of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\), so:
  \[
  [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x, \quad [\text{Ca-EDTA}] = 0.02 - x
  \]
- Since \(K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}\) is very large, the dissociation is minimal, so \(0.02 - x \approx 0.02\).

### Step 2: Write the equilibrium expression
The formation constant is given by:
\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]
Substitute the equilibrium concentrations:
\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x \cdot x} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \(x\)
Rearranging for \(x^2\):
\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]
\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12}
\]
Taking the square root:
\[
x = \sqrt{0.4 \times 10^{-12}} = \sqrt{0.4} \times 10^{-6} \approx 0.632 \times 10^{-6} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which matches option C.
