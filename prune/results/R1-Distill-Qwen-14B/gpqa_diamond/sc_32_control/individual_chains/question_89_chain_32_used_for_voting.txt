Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The first part involves 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. Then, the IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which I think is a carbonyl group. The 1H NMR of product 1 has some specific signals: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Hmm, what does this mean?

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is an adamantane derivative with two bromine atoms. Heating with KOH, especially in a high amount, probably leads to a dehydrohalogenation reaction. Since there are two bromines, maybe it's eliminating to form a double bond. Wait, but elimination usually forms alkenes, so maybe the product is 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. Wait, no, because the IR shows a carbonyl, which is a C=O stretch. Oh, right! Maybe it's an epoxide or a ketone.

Wait, no. KOH is a strong base, but heating dibromides with KOH could lead to elimination, forming a double bond, but if the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, perhaps it's an elimination to form an allene or cyclopropane? Or wait, maybe it's a Dieckmann condensation? No, that's for cyclic esters. Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide elimination, leading to an alkene. But KOH could also lead to a substitution, but since it's a dihalide, substitution would give a diol. Wait, but if it's heated with excess KOH, maybe it's a double elimination, forming an epoxide? Wait, no, epoxide formation usually comes from a vicinal dihalide, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is not vicinal—it's 1 and 3 positions apart.

Wait, maybe elimination forms a diene? But then where would the carbonyl come from? Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol, but heat and KOH would dehydrate it. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think.

Another approach: the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O). So product 1 probably has a ketone group. Also, the NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a high shift, maybe an -OH or an -OCH2- group. But wait, 4.79 is more downfield than an alcohol, so maybe it's an ether or a ketone adjacent to some protons.

Wait, when a dihalide is treated with KOH, especially with elimination, maybe it forms a diketone. Wait, how? Alternatively, could it form a gem-diol? No, that would be a diol, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a case where each Br is replaced by an OH, but that would give a diol, and then dehydration would form a ketone. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane—if each Br is replaced by an OH, you'd get 1,3-adamantanediol. But then, when heated with KOH, maybe it loses water to form a ketone. Wait, but how? Because 1,3 diol might lose two water molecules to form a conjugated diene, but that doesn't involve a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond, but with two eliminations. Since it's 1,3-dibromo, elimination would form a diene. Wait, but 1,3-diene would require two adjacent double bonds, which isn't possible because that would be allene. But that might not explain the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the reaction conditions. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides are treated with a base, they can eliminate to form alkenes. But if there are two bromines, maybe each can eliminate, possibly forming a conjugated diene. But how does that lead to a carbonyl? Maybe the initial elimination is to form an alcohol, which then undergoes further reaction.

Wait, another angle. The IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. So the product 1 must have a ketone. So perhaps the initial step is dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. How? Maybe each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group, and then the diol undergoes elimination to form a ketone. Wait, but that would require some rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a double bond, but with two Brs, maybe two eliminations happen.

Wait, perhaps it's a conjugate elimination. Let me consider the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent carbons. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on adjacent carbons, perhaps. So perhaps when KOH is added, each Br is eliminated with a base, leading to a double bond between C1 and C2, and another between C3 and C4, but that would not form a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe each elimination forms a carbonyl. But how? Oh! Wait, maybe when a dihalide is treated with a strong base like KOH, it can undergo dehydrohalogenation twice to form a ketone. Because each elimination would lose H and Br, but in a way that forms a carbonyl.

Wait, let me think about vicinal dihalides. When a vicinal dihalide (like 1,2-dibromoethane) is treated with strong base, it can eliminate to form an alkene. But if the dihalide is 1,3-dibromocyclohexane or something, elimination could lead to a diene. But in this case, the product has a carbonyl, so perhaps it's a conjugated dienone or something else.

Wait, perhaps the initial product is a diketone. How? Maybe each Br is replaced by an O- group, then the base causes elimination to form a ketone.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, each Br leaving as Br^- and forming a carbonyl. So, each Br is at a position that upon elimination, forms a carbonyl group. So, the product would be a diketone. But the NMR only shows one carbonyl peak? Or perhaps each carbonyl is equivalent, so only one peak is seen. But let me think about the NMR data.

The NMR of product 1 has a 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a singlet, assuming it's two equivalent protons. Maybe this is an -OCH2- group, but 4.79 is a bit high for that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone adjacent to some protons. Wait, maybe it's an epoxide? But epoxides have protons around 3-4 ppm, I think. Or maybe an ether.

Wait, the IR carbonyl suggests a ketone. So let's imagine that product 1 is a ketone. How would the NMR look? A ketone adjacent to some CH2 groups perhaps. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl. For example, if the structure is something like (CH2) attached to a carbonyl.

Wait, let's think about the structure. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH in a substitution reaction. But that would form a diol. Then, under heat, the diol could lose water to form a carbonyl group. But for that to happen, the diol must be in a position that allows for the formation of a carbonyl, which would require elimination of water from adjacent -OH groups. Wait, but 1,3-diol would have OH groups on adjacent carbons, which upon elimination would form a double bond, not a carbonyl. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps each OH group is on a bridgehead carbon, and elimination would form a carbonyl. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the initial substitution gives a diol, and then some kind of oxidation occurs. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, each Br leaving and forming a double bond. Wait, but then why the IR shows a carbonyl?

Wait, another approach. Let's say the initial reaction is an elimination to form an alkene, but then the alkene undergoes some further reaction. But under what conditions? KOH is a base and can cause elimination but perhaps not much else. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone because the base caused a ring contraction or expansion, but I don't know enough about adamantane's structure for that.

Wait, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane when heated with KOH undergoes a double substitution, each Br replaced by OH, forming 1,3-adamantanediol. Then, under heat, this diol could lose water to form a ketone. But wait, the elimination of two water molecules would form a diketone. Because each OH is on a different carbon, so eliminating one water would form a double bond, but eliminating two might form a ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol undergoes a pinacol-like rearrangement. The pinacol rearrangement is when a 1,2-diol loses water to form a carbonyl. But if the diol is 1,3, that's not adjacent, so pinacol rearrangement doesn't apply. So maybe that's not it.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should proceed to the next steps and see if that gives me any clues.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. I'm not too familiar with that reagent, but aluminum isopropoxide is often used as a Lewis acid catalyst. Maybe it's involved in some kind of ring-opening or Friedel-Crafts type reaction. Wait, but product 1 has a ketone. So perhaps product 2 is the result of some kind of alkylation or acylation.

Wait, another thought. If product 1 is a ketone, then heating with Al(OiPr)3 might facilitate a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring, and adamantane isn't aromatic. So maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen rearrangement? Or some kind of elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and Al(OiPr)3 is used as a catalyst in some addition reaction.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's think about product 1 again.

The 1H NMR of product 1: 4.79 (2H, singlet?), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR peak suggests a carbonyl.

So, the 4.79 (2H) is probably a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. If it's a ketone, perhaps the structure is something like (CH2)CO. Wait, but that would be more around 2.1 ppm for the CH2 next to a ketone. Hmm, maybe it's an ester group? But the IR carbonyl would be around 1720, which is more typical of a ketone or ester.

Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, but the IR carbonyl doesn't fit. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again about the IR. 1720 is a carbonyl, but the 4.79 ppm could be an OCH2 group, perhaps from an ester or ether.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the product is a geminal diol, but that would have two OH groups on the same carbon. But then, the NMR would show a broad peak, maybe, but not at 4.79 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. For example, if the dihalide is converted into a diester, but that doesn't fit with KOH.

Wait, what if product 1 is a diketone? Then, the NMR would show peaks for the ketone adjacent CH2 groups. Let's think, in a diketone, the carbonyl groups would be at maybe around 2.2 ppm for the neighboring CH2.

But looking at the NMR data, 2.41-2.23 (10H) and 1.94 (2H). If the molecule has multiple equivalent CH2 groups, perhaps due to symmetry in adamantane.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide with some other substituents. But then, the carbonyl in IR wouldn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the product isn't a ketone but an aldehyde, but aldehydes have higher chemical shifts, like around 9-10 ppm. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl is part of an ester group. For example, if the product is an ester, then the carbonyl would be around 1720 cm-1. Then, the NMR would have an OCH2 group, which could be around 4.79 ppm.

But wait, how would KOH lead to an ester? Esters are usually formed from alcohols and carboxylic acids, or through esterification reactions. KOH is a base, so perhaps it's a saponification reaction, but that's for esters to form carboxylate salts. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought. Maybe product 1 is a hemiacetal or something else. No, not likely with KOH.

I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should move on and see if the next steps give me any clues.

Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess Al(OiPr)3. Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, giving product 3.

Ozonolysis of a diene typically cleaves it into carbonyl compounds. So if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break it into fragments.

Looking at the options for the NMR of product 3, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange with solvent.

So, the most deshielded proton would be the one in the most electron-deficient environment, probably near a carbonyl group.

But let me think about the overall process.

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid, with C=O)
2. Product 1 + Al(OiPr)3 → product 2
3. Product 2 + ozonolysis → product 3

What's product 2? Perhaps a diene. Because when you ozonolyse a diene, you get carbonyl compounds.

So, if product 2 is a diene, product 3 would be the ozonolysis products, which are carbonyl compounds.

But wait, let's piece it together.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1.

Assuming product 1 is a diol (1,3-adamantanediol), but that's just substitution. Then, step 2: heating with Al(OiPr)3. Al is a Lewis acid, maybe it's used in some kind of acid-catalyzed elimination. So, perhaps the diol loses water to form a diene. But diols typically form alkenes upon elimination, but to form a diene would require two eliminations.

Wait, if product 1 is 1,3-adamantanediol, then heating with a Lewis acid might cause dehydration to form a diene. So, product 2 would be 1,3-adamantadiene.

Then, product 2 is ozonolysed. Ozonolysis of a diene would typically break each double bond into carbonyl groups. But wait, if the diene is conjugated, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. But in the case of a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would form a diketone or dialdehyde or something else, depending on substituents.

Wait, but the diene is part of the adamantane structure. Ozonolysis would break the double bonds into carbonyl groups. Let's imagine that product 2 is a conjugated diene in an adamantane structure. Ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyls. But since it's a conjugated diene, ozonolysis might result in a single carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Ozonolysis of a conjugated diene (like 1,3-pentadiene) would result in breaking each double bond, but since they are conjugated, the molecule would break into two carbonyl compounds. Wait, but the structure of adamantane is a diamondoid hydrocarbon. If product 2 is an adamantadiene, ozonolysis would cleave the double bonds into carbonyls, but the structure would determine the exact product.

But let's think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis at low temperatures (like -78°C) typically leads to reductive cleavage, but with dimethyl sulfide (a reductive work-up), the ozonides are cleaved into carbonyl groups without over-oxidizing.

So, if product 2 is a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. But the exact structure would dictate how many and what kind of carbonyl groups.

But let's think about the coupling pattern in the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded proton is probably near a carbonyl. The coupling pattern depends on neighboring protons.

If the structure is a carbonyl group with adjacent CH2 groups, the protons on CH2 would be split by neighboring protons. For example, if a CH2 is next to another CH2, which is next to a carbonyl, the coupling could be a triplet of triplets or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each end of the ozonolysis product has a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. So, each CH2 would have neighboring Hs, leading to specific coupling patterns.

Wait, but the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen. So, the most downfield-shifted proton in product 3. This is likely to be a proton adjacent to a carbonyl group.

In product 3, if the structure is something like (CH2)CO, the CH2 next to the carbonyl would have protons that are deshielded. The coupling would depend on neighboring Hs.

For example, if the CH2 is next to another CH2 group, each H on the first CH2 would couple with Hs on the adjacent CH2. Let's say each CH2 has two Hs, and each is adjacent to another CH2 with two Hs. Then, each H would be split into a quartet (n+1, where n=3? Wait, no, n is the number of neighboring Hs. If two adjacent protons on each neighboring CH2, maybe it's a triplet or more.

Wait, perhaps it's a CH2 next to another CH2 and a CH group. Let me think of a specific structure.

Alternatively, considering the initial structure, after ozonolysis, product 3 might have two carbonyl groups, each adjacent to CH2 groups. So, each CH2 would have neighboring Hs.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, and next to another CH2. So each H on CH2 would couple with two neighboring Hs on the adjacent CH2. That would make each H a triplet of triplets? Or a doublet of triplets?

Wait, the splitting comes from neighboring Hs. So, for a CH2 group next to another CH2, each H on the first CH2 would be next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, each H would split into a triplet (n=2, so triplet). But wait, are there any other couplings?

Wait, if the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, each H on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs on the neighboring CH2. So the splitting would be a triplet. But what if there are other adjacent groups? For example, if the CH2 is next to a CH group, which is next to another CH2, the coupling might be more complex.

Alternatively, if the structure is (CH2)2CO, then each CH2 is next to another CH2. So each H on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, resulting in a triplet. The adjacent CH2 would also be next to the carbonyl, so their Hs are also adjacent to the first CH2's Hs, but since they're the same, perhaps it's a doublet of triplets or something else.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 is between two carbonyls. No, that's not likely because ozonolysis would break the diene into carbonyl groups on each end.

Alternatively, perhaps each end of the ozonolysis product is a carbonyl with a CH2 group attached. So, each CH2 is next to a carbonyl and another CH2 group. So each CH2 would have two neighboring Hs. So each H would be a triplet.

Wait, but the question is about the most deshielded H. If the H is on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, it would be downfield-shifted. The coupling would be with the neighboring CH2's Hs, so each H would be a triplet.

Looking at the options, option A is a triplet, which could fit this scenario.

But wait, another possibility: if the CH2 is next to a CH group, which is next to a CH2, the coupling could be more complex. For example, each H on CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2 and perhaps one H on a CH group, leading to a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets.

Hmm, but without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit tricky. Let me try to reconstruct the entire process.

Original compound: 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

Step 1: KOH, heat → product 1.

Assuming product 1 is 1,3-adamantanediol (but not sure). Then, step 2: Al(OiPr)3, heat → product 2. If Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid, maybe it catalyzes dehydration of the diol to form a diene. So product 2 is 1,3-adamantadiene.

Step 3: ozonolysis → product 3.

Ozonolysis of a diene (probably a conjugated diene) would break each double bond, but in a conjugated diene, the ozonolysis would break the molecule into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would be two carbonyl compounds.

Wait, but adamantane is a rigid structure. If product 2 is a diene within the adamantane framework, ozonolysis would cleave each double bond, but given the symmetry, perhaps each ozonolysis produces two identical ketones.

Wait, if the diene is in a position where cleavage would yield two ketone groups, then product 3 would have two ketones. But I'm not exactly sure about the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the diene is part of a bridge, so ozonolysis would split it into two carbonyl groups on each bridge.

But regardless of the exact structure, let's focus on the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded H is probably on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Assuming the structure is something like (CH2)CO. Each CH2 would have two Hs. If each CH2 is next to another CH2 group, then each H would couple with two Hs, resulting in a triplet.

But wait, maybe each CH2 is next to a CH group. For example, if the structure is CH2-CO, then each H on CH2 would see the neighboring CH group's Hs. But CH groups have only one H, so each H on CH2 would couple with that one H, leading to a doublet.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is next to another CH2, which is next to a carbonyl. So each H on the first CH2 would see two Hs from the adjacent CH2, resulting in a triplet. But what if the adjacent CH2 is also next to another CH2? Then, perhaps the splitting becomes more complex.

Wait, maybe the structure is (CH2)2CO. So, CH2-CH2-CO. Each CH2 would have two Hs. The first CH2 is next to the second CH2, which is next to the carbonyl. So each H on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. The Hs on the second CH2 would be adjacent to the carbonyl, but their coupling would be with the first CH2's Hs, so they'd be triplets as well.

In that case, the most deshielded H (on the second CH2) would be a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet, which is option A.

But wait, let's think again about the coupling. The second CH2 is next to the carbonyl and adjacent to the first CH2. So each H on the second CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the first CH2. So each H would be a triplet. So the most deshielded H would be a triplet.

So the answer would be A) triplet.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Reaction with KOH**: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH likely results in a double elimination, forming a diketone (product 1). The IR spectrum shows a strong carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, consistent with a ketone. The ¹H NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a structure with a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group and additional CH₂ groups in the adamantane framework.

2. **Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**: Heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely induces further elimination, forming a conjugated diene (product 2). This step converts the diketone into a diene by removing functional groups and creating double bonds.

3. **Ozonolysis**: Ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C followed by dimethyl sulfide cleaves the double bonds, forming product 3. The ozonolysis of a conjugated diene typically produces carbonyl compounds. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **Coupling Pattern in Product 3**: The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. This CH₂ group is also adjacent to another CH₂ group. Each hydrogen on the CH₂ group couples with the two hydrogens on the neighboring CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet coupling pattern.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.
