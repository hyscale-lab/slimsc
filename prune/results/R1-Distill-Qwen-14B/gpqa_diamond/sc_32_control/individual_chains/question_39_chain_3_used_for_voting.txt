Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that behaves the same way under the same conditions. Each particle moves along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function of each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Wait, but the wave function usually has both real and imaginary parts, right? Oh, and 'i' here is the imaginary unit, the square root of -1.

The question says that when they measured the position of the particles, none were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3. That must mean that the wave function is zero outside this interval, but how does that relate to the given wave function?

Hmm, wait, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalizable. Also, the probability of finding a particle in a region is given by the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over that region. Since the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, the wave function must be zero outside this region. So I think the wave function is zero for x <1 and x>3, and the given expression applies in between.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that seems a bit strange because if it's non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, then the wave function should be zero elsewhere. But the expression given is continuous, so maybe it's defined only between x=1 and x=3, and zero outside. So the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3, and inside that interval, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i.

Wait, but that can't be right because the wave function would have to be continuous. Oh, perhaps the wave function is given only in the region where it's non-zero. So the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i for x between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere.

But I'm a bit confused because typically, wave functions are square-integrable and must satisfy certain boundary conditions. The absolute square of the wave function gives the probability density. So the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1 for normalization.

Wait, let me write down the wave function. ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But in this case, when x is between 1 and 3, the expression is valid, and zero otherwise. So to find 'a', I need to normalize the wave function. The integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from -infinity to infinity should be 1.

But since ψ(x) is zero outside 1 and 3, the integral reduces to the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx equals 1.

So let's compute |ψ(x)|². Since ψ(x) is a complex function, the absolute square is ψ*(x) * ψ(x), where * denotes the complex conjugate.

So ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i.

The complex conjugate ψ*(x) would be (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i.

Multiplying them together:

|ψ(x)|² = [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i ] [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i ]

This is of the form (A - Bi)(A + Bi) = A² + B².

So, |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

Because (0.5i) multiplied by (0.5i) is (0.25)(i²) = -0.25, but since we have negative signs when expanding, wait no, wait:

Wait, let me compute [a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i][a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i] = [a/sqrt(1+x)]² + [0.5i]^2 [Wait, no, because (a - b)(a + b) is a² - b². So in this case, it's (a/sqrt(1+x))² - (0.5i)^2.

Wait, wait, that's correct. So let's compute:

(a/sqrt(1+x))^2 is a²/(1+x).

(0.5i)^2 is (0.25)(i²) = 0.25*(-1) = -0.25.

So the product is [a²/(1+x)] - (-0.25) = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Ah, right. So |ψ(x)|² is a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx must equal 1.

So let's compute this integral.

Split it into two parts:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x)] dx + integral from 1 to3 of 0.25 dx.

Compute each separately.

First integral: a² ∫ dx/(1+x) from 1 to3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|.

So from 1 to3, it's ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first integral is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to3.

That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5: a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) approximately: ln(2) is about 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a is the square root of 0.7213. Let's compute that.

sqrt(0.7213) is approximately 0.849, which is around 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

So the value of a is approximately 0.85.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, wait, the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So when we compute |ψ|², it's [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Then, the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Which becomes a² ln(2) + 0.5*(2) = a² ln(2) + 0.5 * (3-1) = a² ln(2) + 0.5 *2= a² ln(2) + 1.

Wait, wait wait, no. Wait, the integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5. So the total integral is a² * ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 /0.6931≈ 0.7213.

a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

So the correct answer is option B, 0.85.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by normalizing the given wave function. The wave function is:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is given by the absolute square of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \psi^*(x) \psi(x)
\]

Taking the complex conjugate of \( \psi(x) \), we get:

\[
\psi^*(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} + 0.5i
\]

Multiplying \( \psi(x) \) and \( \psi^*(x) \), we find:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), so the normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 1
\]

1. For the first integral:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln|1+x| \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
\]

Thus, the first term becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2)
\]

2. For the second integral:

\[
0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 (3-1) = 0.5
\]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Subtracting \( 0.5 \) from both sides:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
