Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for these reactions is usually measured in kilojoules per mole.

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Let me jot down the details. 

First, HCl is a strong acid, right? So it will dissociate completely. The volume is 500 mL (which is 0.5 liters) and the concentration is 0.2 M. So the moles of HCl would be Molarity × Volume. Let me calculate that: 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is monoprotic, each mole gives one H+ ion. So 0.1 moles of H+ from HCl.

Next, H2SO4 is sulfuric acid. It's a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. So each mole gives two H+ ions. The volume is 300 mL, which is 0.3 liters. Concentration is 0.3 M. Moles of H2SO4 would be 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Since each mole gives two H+, that's 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

Now, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. The volume is 200 mL (0.2 L), and concentration is 0.5 M. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each mole gives two OH- ions. So moles of Ba(OH)2 are 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives two OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait. When mixing an acid and a base, the OH- will react with H+ to form water. So the total H+ from the acids is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles. The OH- is 0.2 moles. So the neutralization will be between H+ (0.28) and OH- (0.2).

In such cases, the limiting reagent is the one with fewer moles. So OH- is 0.2, H+ is 0.28. So OH- will be the limiting reactant. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, consuming 0.2 moles of H+. 

Wait, but wait—H2SO4 is diprotic, so maybe I should think about how much of each acid is consumed. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of equivalents. Because H2SO4 can donate two H+ per mole, so each mole is equivalent to two equivalents of H+.

So let me re-calculate the equivalents:

- HCl: 0.1 moles × 1 eq/mol = 0.1 eq
- H2SO4: 0.09 moles × 2 eq/mol = 0.18 eq
- Ba(OH)2: 0.1 moles × 2 eq/mol (since each Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- which can accept two H+) → 0.2 eq.

Wait, no, wait: No, wait, for the base, each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions, so each mole is equivalent to two equivalents of OH-. So the total equivalents of OH- is 0.2 eq.

Total equivalents of H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 eq.

The reaction between H+ and OH- is 1:1. So the OH- has 0.2 eq, which is less than the H+ 0.28. So the neutralization will use up all 0.2 eq of OH-, and 0.2 eq of H+.

Wait, but H2SO4 is diprotic. So maybe the first H+ is stronger, and perhaps the second is weaker. But in the case of strong acids, both H+ are available. So I think it's correct to add all H+ contributions.

So the neutralization would produce 0.2 moles of water, since each mole of H+ and OH- gives one mole of H2O.

Wait, no, the equivalence point is when moles of H+ equals moles of OH-. So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So they'll neutralize 0.2 moles each, leaving 0.08 moles of H+ unreacted.

Wait, but wait—the question is about the enthalpy of neutralization. The enthalpy of neutralization is typically per mole of H+ or per mole of OH- reacting. So the enthalpy change would be based on the amount that actually reacts.

But wait, another approach: the enthalpy of neutralization (ΔH) is usually given as the heat released when one mole of acid reacts with one mole of base. For strong acids and bases, the ΔH is approximately -57 kJ/mol (or about -28.4 kcal/mol), because each mole of H+ and OH- combines to form water, releasing heat.

Wait, I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and strong base is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-). So if I have 0.2 moles reacting, then the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. But wait, the options here are in kcal and kJ. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

A) -2.72 kcal → about -11.4 kJ? Because 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So 2.72 kcal is approximately 11.4 kJ. So -2.72 kcal is about -11.4 kJ. Hmm, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is the same as -11.4 kJ.

Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -47.6 kJ.

Option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The neutralization here is 0.2 moles of H+ reacting with 0.2 moles of OH-. So the heat released would be 0.2 × 57 kJ (since it's exothermic, so the value is negative). So 0.2 ×57=11.4 kJ. So the ΔH is -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal (approx).

Wait, because 1 kJ ≈ 0.239 kcal. So 11.4 kJ × 0.239 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So yes, the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is correct.

Wait, but wait—could there be a mistake in my calculation? Let me double-check.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles OH-.

H+ total: 0.28. OH-: 0.2. So 0.2 moles of H+ will react with 0.2 OH-.

So moles of water formed: 0.2.

Each mole of H+ neutralized releases 57 kJ (or 13.1 kcal, since 57 kJ ≈ 13.6 kcal). Wait, wait, wait—hold on, I might have mixed up the numbers.

Wait, wait, no—wait, I think the standard enthalpy for neutralization is about 57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-). So that's per mole of H+ reacting.

So if 0.2 moles H+ react, it's 0.2 *57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. So the ΔH is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72).

So the option A is -2.72 kcal, which would be correct.

But wait, another point: When mixing different acids and bases, the neutralization is determined by the equivalents. So I think I did that correctly.

So the answer should be option A.

To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂, the following steps are performed:

1. **Determine the moles of H⁺ from the acids:**
   - **HCl:** A monoprotic strong acid. Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \). Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of H⁺, so total H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).
   - **H₂SO₄:** A diprotic strong acid. Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \). Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so total H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).
   - **Total H⁺ from acids:** \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Determine the moles of OH⁻ from the base:**
   - **Ba(OH)₂:** A strong base. Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \). Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of OH⁻, so total OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).

3. **Determine the limiting reagent:**
   - The reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻ is 1:1. Total H⁺ available = \( 0.28 \, \text{moles} \), and total OH⁻ available = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \). Since OH⁻ is present in fewer moles, it is the limiting reagent. Thus, \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \) of H⁺ and OH⁻ will react.

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) (or \( -13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol} \)) per mole of H⁺ or OH⁻ neutralized. Since \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \) of H⁺ and OH⁻ react, the total enthalpy change is:
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{moles} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}
     \]
     Converting to kilocalories:
     \[
     \Delta H = \frac{-11.4 \, \text{kJ}}{4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal}} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}
     \]

5. **Match the result to the options:**
   - The calculated enthalpy change of \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) corresponds to option A.

**Answer: A**
