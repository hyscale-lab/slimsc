Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (so one-dimensional). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wave functions usually are complex, right? But when they talk about the position measurements, they're only finding particles between x=1 and x=3. So I guess the wave function must be zero outside this region, but the given form is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that's confusing because the wave function should be normalized, I think.

Wait, maybe I misread. The wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by something else, but the way it's written is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Oh, wait, perhaps that's not the case. Maybe the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) times some complex term, but the way it's written in the question is a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps it's (a / sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5 times i, but that seems odd because the wave function would have a real and imaginary part. But in reality, for a probability amplitude, the wave function's modulus squared gives the probability density.

Wait, but the problem states that when they measured the position, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. That suggests that the wave function is zero outside this interval. So perhaps the given wave function is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. Or maybe the given expression is the wave function in the region where it's non-zero (1 to 3), and zero otherwise.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, but wait that doesn't make much sense because for it to be zero outside 1 and 3, the function must be non-zero only in that interval. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the expression. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by e^{-i...} or something like that, but the given form is just a real part minus an imaginary part. Hmm, I'm a little stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by a complex exponential. Or maybe the given expression is just a simplified version. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and the actual wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by some exponential term, but the way it's written is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That doesn't seem right because the wave function should be non-zero between 1 and 3.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the wave function isn't normalized, and we have to find the normalization constant 'a' such that the integral of |ψ(x)|² from 1 to 3 equals 1. Because the wave function must be normalized, right? So the modulus squared is |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2, but wait that can't be right because if ψ is a complex number, say ψ = A - i B, then |ψ|² would be A² + B².

Wait, in the given ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is (a / sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. Therefore, the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. Wait, but that would make the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx equal to 1. Hmm, but that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake here.

Wait, maybe the wave function isn't written correctly. Because typically, a wave function in such a region would be a real function multiplied by a complex exponential, which would involve i. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) * e^{-i something}, which would have a real and imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, but that would imply that the real part is (a / sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. But that seems strange because the real and imaginary parts are functions of x, but here the imaginary part is a constant. That can't be right because the imaginary part should vary with x as well.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) e^{-i θ}, where θ is some phase. But in that case, the modulus squared would be (a²)/(1+x), because the exponential has modulus 1. That makes more sense because then the probability density is (a²)/(1+x), and the integral from 1 to 3 would be a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3.

But the given wave function seems to have a real part and an imaginary part. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to proceed.

So, the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5 i. So ψ(x) = A(x) + i B(x), where A(x) = a/sqrt(1+x), and B(x) = -0.5. Then, |ψ(x)|² = A(x)^2 + B(x)^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

But if the wave function is this, then the integral of |ψ|^2 from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. So:

∫₁³ [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute that integral.

The integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 is a² [ ln(1+x) ] from 1 to 3.

Which is a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ) ] = a² ln(2).

The integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So overall:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, B is 0.85, which is close. So the answer would be option B.

Wait, but wait a minute. Another thought: is the wave function given correctly? Because if the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, then the imaginary part is a constant, which seems odd. Normally, the wave function's real and imaginary parts would both depend on x.

Alternatively, perhaps the given wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5 i * something else. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the expression. Alternatively, maybe the wave function is only real, but that doesn't seem right because the presence of 'i' suggests a complex component.

Wait, perhaps the 'i' is a typo, and the wave function is entirely real. In that case, the wave function would be (a / sqrt(1 + x)), and the normalization would be ∫₁³ (a²)/(1+x) dx = 1.

But in that case, the integral would be a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2) = 1. So a² = 1 / ln(2) ≈ 1.4427, so a ≈ 1.2019. But that's not one of the options. The options given are A)1.1, B)0.85, C)0.35, D)0.6. So 1.2019 isn't an option, so that scenario is unlikely.

Wait, but the presence of 'i' in the wave function suggests it's a complex wave function. So I must have made a mistake in my earlier approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by e^{-i ...} some phase, but the given expression is written as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, maybe the wave function is written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i). But that's not what the problem says. The problem says (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5 i. So ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5)i.

So, |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

But when we integrate this from 1 to 3, we have to set it equal to 1.

So the integral becomes:

∫₁³ (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx = a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) → a ≈ sqrt(0.5 / 0.6931) ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85, option B.

But wait, why is the wave function's imaginary part a constant? That seems a bit odd. Usually, the imaginary part would depend on x. But perhaps the problem is set up this way, and we just proceed with it.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is supposed to be (a / sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by some complex exponential, but the way it's written may have a typo. For example, maybe the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) e^{-i 0.5}, but that would make the imaginary part a function of x via the exponential. Hmm, but again, the given expression is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, which is a real part and a constant imaginary part.

So given that, I think the approach is correct. The normalization condition gives a ≈ 0.85, which is option B.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the normalization constant \( a \) for the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}} - 0.5i
\]

### Key Observations:
1. The wave function is complex, with a real part \( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}} \) and an imaginary part \( -0.5 \).
2. The probability density is given by \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \text{Re}[\psi(x)]^2 + \text{Im}[\psi(x)]^2 \), which simplifies to:
   \[
   |\psi(x)|^2 = \frac{a^2}{1 + x} + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25
   \]
3. The wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), as particles are not found outside this interval. Thus, the normalization condition is:
   \[
   \int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
   \]

### Normalization Condition:
Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) into the integral:
\[
\int_1^3 \left( \frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25 \right) dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two separate integrals:
\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1 + x} \, dx + \int_1^3 0.25 \, dx = 1
\]

#### First Integral:
\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1 + x} \, dx = a^2 \left[ \ln(1 + x) \right]_1^3 = a^2 \left( \ln(4) - \ln(2) \right) = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

#### Second Integral:
\[
\int_1^3 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

Combining the results:
\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Simplify for \( a^2 \):
\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):
\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

### Final Answer:
The value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
