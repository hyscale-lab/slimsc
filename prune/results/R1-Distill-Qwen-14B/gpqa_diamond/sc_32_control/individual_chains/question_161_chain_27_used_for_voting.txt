Okay, so I've got this question about transmission electron microscopes and the mean free path of gas molecules in the vacuum chamber. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

So, the setup: Mike is using a high-res TEM at 1000 kV. He's got these vacuum pumps creating an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to get rid of as many gas molecules as possible because, in electron microscopy, gas can cause problems like scattering the electrons, right? But even after pumping, some gas particles are left, and Mike measures their mean free path as λ1. Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, so in a vacuum, it's longer because there are fewer molecules to bump into.

Now, when he starts the electron beam, he notices something interesting. The mean free path changes to λ2, which is different from λ1. And the temperature is the same, so that shouldn't be a factor. Wait, why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on?

I remember that mean free path depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. Oh, but wait, pressure is already very low here. The formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d² * P), where d is the diameter of the gas molecules, and P is the pressure. Since the pressure didn't change (temperature same, and pressure is given), why is λ changing?

Wait, but when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving at high energies. They might be interacting with the gas molecules. Oh, right! The electrons can cause the gas molecules to ionize or maybe even knock them out of the vacuum chamber. But wait, in a high vacuum, the electron beam can cause gas molecules to be excited or even create more ions. Oh, but wait, in ultra-high vacuum, the electron beam can actually cause gas to be released from the chamber's surfaces. Or maybe the electrons are causing the gas molecules to scatter more.

Wait, another angle: the electron beam emits high-energy electrons. These could cause the gas molecules to gain energy, perhaps leading to more collisions because now the molecules are moving faster. Or, more accurately, when the electrons hit the gas, it might cause the gas to ionize. If the gas becomes ionized, the ions can be accelerated by the electric fields in the microscope, leading to different behavior.

Wait, but in an electron microscope, the presence of even a few gas molecules can cause electron scattering, which reduces image resolution. So when Mike starts the beam, he's introducing a high-energy electron beam into the chamber. The electrons could cause the gas molecules to ionize. If the molecules are ionized, they become charged, which affects how they interact with the electron beam.

Wait, but the mean free path λ is determined by the probability of collisions between the gas molecules themselves, right? Or is it about the collisions between the gas and the electrons? Hmm. Oh, wait, in the initial scenario, λ1 is the mean free path for the gas molecules themselves, based on the chamber's conditions. But when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might interact more with the electrons, not with each other.

Wait, the mean free path for electrons in the presence of gas would be different. But the question says Mike is observing the mean free path of the gas molecules. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me read the question again.

The question says that when the electron beam is on, the mean free path λ is now λ2. So the gas molecules' mean free path has changed. So why would that be?

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be excited or ionized, which changes their effective diameter. Like, if the gas molecules are ionized, their effective cross-sectional area (d) might change. That would affect the mean free path.

If the gas is ionized, the ions have a larger effective diameter because of their charge, maybe? Or perhaps the electrons are causing the gas molecules to move faster, increasing their mean speed, thus reducing the mean free path. Wait, but the temperature is the same, so the speed should remain similar. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might get bombarded by electrons, causing more collisions. So the mean free path λ might decrease because the gas molecules are colliding more often. But wait, the initial λ1 was already under ultra-high vacuum, so the pressure is so low that the mean free path was quite long. If the electron beam induces more activity, perhaps the effective pressure increases, making λ shorter.

Wait, but the pressure in the chamber is given as <1e-9 Torr. That's a very high vacuum. The presence of the electron beam might not change the pressure much because there's so little gas to begin with. But perhaps the beam causes the gas molecules to be more active, perhaps increasing their collision rate.

Wait, another approach: The mean free path for gas molecules is given by λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d² * P). If the pressure P is the same, then λ should remain the same. But in this problem, λ changes when the beam is on. So what's different?

Wait, maybe the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to heat up, but the temperature remains the same as per the question. So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps when the electron beam is present, the gas molecules are being acted upon by the electric or magnetic fields of the microscope. For example, in a strong electric field, charged particles (like ions) would experience a force and perhaps move faster or change direction, leading to more frequent collisions. But wait, in this case, the gas molecules in the chamber are neutral unless ionized.

Wait, but in the presence of the electron beam, the gas can become ionized. So if the gas was neutral before, and now becomes ions, their cross-sectional area might effectively increase, making the mean free path shorter.

Alternatively, when the gas is ionized, the ions might have different behavior, but I'm not sure how that affects their own mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be scattered more. So when the beam is on, every time a gas molecule scatters an electron, the molecule might gain some energy, leading to more collisions with other molecules.

Wait, but the mean free path is determined by the collisions between gas molecules, not the electrons. Wait, no. The mean free path λ1 was measured in the vacuum state, so it's the average path a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule.

But when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules could be colliding with the electrons more. But that's a different kind of collision. Does that affect their mean free path based on gas-gas collisions?

Hmm. Or perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more likely to collide with the chamber walls, but the chamber is big and the mean free path is longer than the chamber's dimensions? No, because the mean free path is based on the chamber's volume, pressure, etc.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about why λ would change. The only factors affecting λ are the pressure, temperature, and the effective diameter of the gas molecules.

If the pressure remains the same (since the pumps are running and the temperature is same), λ should stay the same. However, the problem says that λ changes. So perhaps the effective diameter d changes.

But why would d change? Oh! When the electron beam is on, the gas molecules may become polarized or charged, which would affect their effective diameter. Alternatively, they might be ionized, making their cross-section larger.

Wait, if the gas molecules are ionized, they become charged particles. Charged particles have different interactions. So the cross-section for collisions might be larger because they attract or repel each other more. So d would be larger, which would decrease the mean free path λ.

Because λ is inversely proportional to d squared. So if d increases, λ decreases.

So, if the gas is ionized, λ2 would be less than λ1. Because λ = k*T/(d² * P * ...). So if d increases, λ decreases.

So λ2 < λ1. So the correct answer would be option C) λ2 < λ1.

But wait, why would the mean free path decrease? Because the gas molecules are now charged, so their effective diameter for collision purposes is larger, leading to more frequent collisions. So the mean free path would be shorter.

So in the scenario, when Mike turns on the electron beam, the gas becomes ionized, leading to a smaller mean free path. So λ2 < λ1.

Looking at the options, option C says λ2 < λ1. That must be the answer.

The scenario involves a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating in an ultra-high vacuum (< 10^-9 Torr) with a mean free path of gas molecules initially determined as λ1. Upon initiating the electron beam, Mike observes a change in the mean free path to λ2. The question asks how λ2 relates to λ1.

The mean free path, λ, is given by the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{k \cdot T}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \pi \cdot d^2 \cdot P}
\]

where \(d\) is the effective diameter of the gas molecules, \(P\) is the pressure, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. Since the temperature and pressure remain constant, any change in λ must arise from a change in \(d\), the effective diameter of the gas molecules.

When the electron beam is turned on, the high-energy electrons can ionize the gas molecules. Ionization increases the effective diameter of the gas molecules due to their charge, as charged particles interact more strongly with each other, effectively increasing their cross-sectional area. This increase in \(d\) reduces the mean free path, as λ is inversely proportional to \(d^2\). Therefore, λ2 becomes shorter than λ1.

Given the options, the correct conclusion is that λ2 < λ1.
