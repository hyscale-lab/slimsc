Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. We start by diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I think I need to figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution.

Wait, the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water. Since the volumes are additive, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration would be (volume1 * concentration1) / total volume. Let me compute that.

Volume1 is 20 cm³, which is 0.02 L. Concentration is 0.05 M. So moles of acetic acid are 0.02 * 0.05 = 0.001 moles. Then total volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So concentration after dilution is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when we titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so the reaction should be CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At 25% titration, I think that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So, I need to find how much NaOH is added at this point.

Wait, but maybe I should first find the equivalence point. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles (since 0.04 L is 40 cm³). So, moles of NaOH needed would be 0.001 moles.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence point is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

Now, let's model the solution at 25% titration. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001. Moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

So, the reaction will convert 0.00025 moles of acetic acid to acetate ions (CH3COO^-). So, moles of acetic acid left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate formed: 0.00025 mol.

The total volume is the initial acetic acid volume plus water plus the NaOH added. Wait, initial solution was 40 cm³, adding 2.5 cm³. So total volume is 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So, concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. The Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is about 4.73 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5-0.267=4.733).

So, pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.333) is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253, which is approximately 4.25. Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, which is close.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let me get exact values.

pKa: log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5). Log(1.85)=0.267, so pKa=4.733.

The ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So log(1/3) is -0.4771.

So pH=4.733 -0.4771=4.256, which is about 4.26. So that's the first part.

Now, at the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water, which is a buffer situation, but since it's a salt of a weak acid, the solution will be basic.

The moles of acetate ions are 0.001 mol. The total volume is 40 cm³ (diluted solution) plus the 10 cm³ of NaOH added (since at equivalence, 10 cm³ is added). So volume is 50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So, Kb is about 5.405e-10. 

Using the approximation for weak bases, [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C). C is 0.02 M.

So [OH-] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

Then pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98 (since log(1.04)=0.017, so 5 - 0.017=4.983). So pH is 14 - 4.983 ≈ 9.017.

Wait, that's about 9.02, but looking at the options, none of them have such a high pH. Wait, let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Kb. Let me recalculate:

Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10. That's correct.

C is 0.02 M.

So Kb * C = (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11.

The square root is sqrt(1.081e-11) = approx 1.04e-5, as I had.

pOH is about 4.98, pH is about 9.02. But looking at the options, none match this. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the options have equivalence point values of 8.52, 6.73, 7, 6.92. Hmm, so maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, wait, I think I forgot to account for the dilution correctly. Let me double-check.

Wait, at equivalence, the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. The concentration of acetate is 0.001 (moles) in 0.05 L (50 cm³). So [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 M, correct.

But wait, when we add NaOH, does the solution volume increase by 10 cm³? Yes, so 40 +10 =50 cm³.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kw/Ka = 1e-14/(1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10. Correct.

So, [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5.

pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98, so pH is about 9.02.

But none of the options have a pH near 9. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should have considered the sodium hydroxide's effect on the solution more carefully. Or perhaps I should consider that at equivalence, the solution is CH3COO^- and Na+ (a spectator ion). So the solution is basic due to the acetate ion.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the concentration. Let me recalculate the moles and concentration again.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 mol.

At equivalence, all 0.001 mol of CH3COOH is neutralized to 0.001 mol of CH3COO^-.

The total solution volume is 40 cm³ (diluted) + 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm, so I don't see a mistake here. So why is the pH not matching any options? Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Hmm, none have equivalence point around 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the dilution correctly. Wait, when we dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ water, the concentration is 0.025 M, correct.

But when titrating, the solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. Then, when adding 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, the total volume is 50 cm³.

Wait, but another approach might be to find the concentration of acetate at equivalence point. Let me think: the solution is 0.02 M in acetate. So the hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb is Kw/Ka = 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis equation: Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-]

Assume x is [OH^-], so Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) ≈ x²/0.02.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = 4.98 → pH = 14-4.98=9.02.

But none of the options have pH around 9. So perhaps I'm wrong in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that during the titration, the solution isn't just the acetate, but also the sodium hydroxide. Wait, no, at equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized, so the solution is just the acetate ions and the sodium ions, which are spectators.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that I should calculate the pH at equivalence point using the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong base, which I think I did.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the Kb. Let me compute it more accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405405e-10.

Then, Kb * C = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

Square root of that is 1.04e-5, as before.

So pOH is about 4.98. pH is 9.02. But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more precisely.

Let me calculate pOH more accurately.

[OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081081e-11) = approx 1.04e-5.

Wait, because sqrt(1.081081e-11) is sqrt(1.081081) * 1e-5.5. Wait, 1e-11 is (1e-5.5)^2, so sqrt(1e-11)=1e-5.5=3.16e-6. Wait, but 1.081e-11 is 1.081 times 1e-11, so sqrt(1.081) is about 1.04, so 1.04 * 3.16e-6 is around 3.294e-6, which would be 3.294e-6 M. Wait, wait, wait, no: sqrt(1e-11) is 1e-5.5 which is 3.16e-6. So 1.08e-11 is (1.039e-5.5)^2? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me compute sqrt(1.081e-11) numerically.

Let me compute 1.081e-11 = 1.081 × 10^-11.

Take the square root: sqrt(1.081) is approx 1.04, and sqrt(10^-11) is 1e-5.5 = about 3.16e-6. So sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04 * 3.16e-6 ≈ 3.294e-6.

Wait, but wait, 3.294e-6 is 3.294 × 10^-6 M.

So [OH^-] = 3.294e-6 → pOH = -log(3.294e-6).

Log(3.294) is about 0.518, so pOH is 5.482.

Then pH is 14 -5.482=8.518, which is approximately 8.52.

Ah, I see! I must have made a calculation error earlier. So the pH at equivalence is 8.52.

So now, the first part of the question, the pH at 25% titration, I got around 4.26, and the equivalence point is 8.52. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought I got 9.02 when I considered the hydrolysis. Where did I go wrong?

Oh, I think I confused the calculation of the square root. Let me recheck:

sqrt(1.081e-11) → let me compute it as:

= sqrt(1.081) * sqrt(1e-11) → sqrt(1.081)=1.0398, sqrt(1e-11)=1e-5.5=3.1623e-6.

So 1.0398 * 3.1623e-6 ≈ 3.294e-6.

Wait, that's 3.294 × 10^-6 M. So [OH^-]=3.294e-6.

pOH = -log(3.294e-6) → Let's compute log(3.294e-6):

log(3.294) ≈ 0.518, log(1e-6)=6 → so log(3.294e-6) = 0.518-6= -5.482.

So pOH is 5.482 → pH=14-5.482=8.518≈8.52. That makes sense now.

So the answer is option A: 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at equivalence.

To solve the problem, we start by determining the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a total volume of 40.00 cm³. The concentration after dilution is calculated as:

\[
\text{Concentration after dilution} = \frac{\text{Initial moles of acetic acid}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.02 \, \text{L} \times 0.05 \, \text{M}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid. The moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.04 \, \text{L} \times 0.025 \, \text{M} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of the NaOH required to reach the equivalence point has been added. Thus, the volume of NaOH added at 25% titration is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH at 25% titration} = 0.25 \times 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

The moles of NaOH added at 25% titration are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = 0.0025 \, \text{L} \times 0.1 \, \text{M} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with an equal amount of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]
\[
\text{Moles of acetate formed} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution at 25% titration is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]
where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73 \), we calculate:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.0059}{0.0176} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized, forming acetate ions. The moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10} \).

Using the approximation for weak bases, the concentration of \(\text{OH}^-\) is:

\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} = \sqrt{(5.41 \times 10^{-10})(0.02)} = \sqrt{1.08 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48,
\]
and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) 4.26; 8.52**

Answer: A
