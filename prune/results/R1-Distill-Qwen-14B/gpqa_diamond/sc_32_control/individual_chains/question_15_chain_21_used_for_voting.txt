Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is about two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, if Planet_2's period is, say, 3 years, Planet_1's would be 1 year. Both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things a bit.

The host stars are different. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. That's interesting—so even though one star is more massive, they're the same size. I'm guessing Planet_2's star is slightly evolved, which might mean it's a subgiant or something, but I'm not sure if that affects the transit probability directly.

The researchers want to observe the planet with the higher probability of transiting. So the question is, which planet has a higher chance to pass in front of its star from our point of view, making a transit observable.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orientation of the orbit. The formula for the transit probability is something like (R_planet + R_star) / (a_planet), but wait, no, I think more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet) * (something else). Or wait, the formula I recall is the geometric probability, which is R_star / a_planet, multiplied by (R_planet / R_star), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no. The geometric probability of a transit is approximately (R_star / a_planet) * (R_planet / R_star). Wait, actually, no, that can't be right. Let me think again. The transit probability is the ratio of the size of the star to the size of the orbit, but adjusted for the inclination. Oh right, the transit probability P is given by:

P = (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet

Wait, but R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so it's roughly R_star / a_planet. But wait, I think it's actually P = (R_star) / (a_planet) multiplied by some factor based on the orbital inclination. Hmm, but wait, the RV method already tells us the mass and the period, but not the inclination because RV measures the velocity along our line of sight. So the inclination is not known, but when considering the transit probability, we can model it as a geometric probability.

Wait, no. The geometric probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star as seen from Earth) is given by (R_star + R_planet) / (a_planet) multiplied by (1 / sin(i)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the probability is (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by (something else). Maybe I should look up the formula, but since I can't, I'll try to think.

I think the correct formula is P = (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (1 + (M_planet / M_star)^(1/3))) ), but wait, that's for the Doppler method's sensitivity. No, maybe not. Alternatively, the geometric probability is just the area of the star relative to the orbit. Since the orbit is circular, the probability is (R_star / a_planet) * (R_planet / R_star) but I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think the geometric transit probability is approximately (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by (R_planet / R_star), but wait, that would give (R_planet / a_planet). No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another approach. The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star's disk to the area of the orbit's disk. Oh wait, that's right. The area of the star is π R_star², and the area of the orbit is π a_planet². So the probability is (R_star / a_planet)². But wait, that's the area-based approach. But since a transit requires the planet to pass in front of the star, the probability should be proportional to (R_star / a_planet), not squared. Hmm.

Wait, no. Let me think about it geometrically. Imagine the star as a circle with radius R_star, and the planet's orbit as a circle with radius a_planet. The probability that a randomly oriented orbit would cause the planet to pass in front of the star is equal to the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. Because the planet's orbital plane has to be aligned within a certain angle for the transit to occur. So the probability is (2 R_star) / (2 a_planet), which simplifies to R_star / a_planet.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the transit probability is approximately (R_star) / (a_planet). Because the planet's orbital diameter is 2 a_planet. So, the probability is (R_star / a_planet).

But wait, that might not be entirely accurate. Another factor is the planet's size, because for a transit to happen, the planet must be large enough to block some of the star's light. But the question is about the probability of a transit occurring, not the detectability. So the transit probability P is mainly determined by R_star and a_planet.

So, P = (R_star) / (a_planet) multiplied by something else? Or is that all? I'm a bit unsure, but I'll proceed with that for now.

Now, both planets have the same mass, but their host stars have different masses. But the stars have the same radius. So R_star_1 = R_star_2 = same.

Wait, wait! The question says that both host stars have the same radii. So R1 = R2. So when calculating R_star, it's the same for both.

So, the transit probability for each planet would be P1 = R_star / a1 and P2 = R_star / a2.

But wait, what's a1 and a2? The semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

But how do I find a1 and a2? Since we know the masses of the stars and the planets, and the orbital periods, we can use Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law: (a^3) / (P^2) = (G (M_star + M_planet)) / (4 pi^2). But since M_planet is much less than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

So a^3 = [G M_star P^2 ] / (4 pi^2 )

Taking cube roots, a = [ (G M_star P^2 )/(4 pi^2) ]^(1/3 )

But perhaps it's easier to relate a1 and a2 through the ratio.

Given that orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Let me denote P1 = P_2 / 3.

Wait, wait, the question says Planet_1 has a shorter period: "the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2." So P1 = P2 / 3.

So P1 = (1/3) P2.

Now, the host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. M1 = 2 M2.

So, M1 = 2 M2.

So let's compute a1 and a2.

Using Kepler's law: a^3 = (G M_star P^2 ) / (4 pi^2 )

So a1^3 = (G * M1 * P1^2 ) / (4 pi^2 )

Similarly, a2^3 = (G * M2 * P2^2 ) / (4 pi^2 )

Taking the ratio of a1^3 to a2^3:

(a1/a2)^3 = [ (G M1 P1^2 ) / (G M2 P2^2 ) ]

Simplify:

= (M1 / M2) * (P1^2 / P2^2 )

Substituting M1 = 2 M2 and P1 = (1/3) P2:

= 2 * ( ( (1/3 P2 )^2 ) / P2^2 )

= 2 * ( ( (1/9) P2^2 ) / P2^2 )

= 2 * (1/9) ) = 2/9.

So (a1/a2)^3 = 2/9

Take cube roots: a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) = cube root of (2/9) ≈ let's see, 2/9 is about 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.606.

Wait, 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

So a1 is about 0.606 times a2.

Now, going back to the transit probability.

P1 = R_star / a1

P2 = R_star / a2

Since R_star is same for both, the ratio P1/P2 is (R_star/a1)/(R_star/a2) ) = a2/(a1) = 1/(a1/a2) ) = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is about 1.65 times higher than P2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability to transit.

Looking back at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Option D says 2.7 times.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any miscalculations.

Wait, (a1/a2) = (2/9)^(1/3) = cube root of (2/9) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

Thus, a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So, P1 = R/a1, P2 = R/a2 = R/(1.65 a1) ) = (1/1.65) P1 ≈ 0.606 P1.

So, P1 is higher. And the ratio P1/P2 is 1.65.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher, so they'd prefer to observe Planet_1, which is option C.

Wait, but let me think again: the transit probability depends on the ratio R_star/a. So if a is smaller, the probability is higher. Since Planet_1 has a smaller a, it's more likely to transit.

But wait, let me make sure I used the correct formula. Another thought: the RV method gives us the minimum mass of the planet, but since the inclination is not known, but when considering the transit, it's the actual mass? No, the transit probability is independent of the planet's mass, only depends on a and R.

So yes, the initial approach is correct.

So the conclusion is that Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, so option C is correct.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is approximately proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_{\text{planet}}} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a_{\text{planet}} \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_{\text{star,1}} = R_{\text{star,2}} \)), the transit probability depends on the ratio \( \frac{1}{a_{\text{planet}}} \), meaning a smaller \( a_{\text{planet}} \) corresponds to a higher transit probability.

### Step 1: Relating Orbital Periods and Semi-Major Axes
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the mass of the host star \( M_{\text{star}} \) as:

\[
a^3 \propto M_{\text{star}} P^2
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- \( M_{\text{star,1}} = 2 M_{\text{star,2}} \)
- \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3} P_2 \)

Taking the ratio of \( a_1^3 \) to \( a_2^3 \):

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_{\text{star,1}} P_1^2}{M_{\text{star,2}} P_2^2} = \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{\left(\frac{1}{3} P_2\right)^2}{P_2^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{9} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606 a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's orbit is smaller than Planet_2's.

### Step 2: Comparing Transit Probabilities
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_{\text{planet}}} \). Since \( R_{\text{star,1}} = R_{\text{star,2}} \), the ratio of transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_1}}{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluating the Options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a higher transit probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The transit probability of Planet_2 is not 1.5 times higher.
- **Option C**: Correct. Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The transit probability of Planet_1 is not 2.7 times higher.

### Conclusion
Planet_1 has a higher transit probability due to its smaller orbital radius, making it the preferred target for observation.
