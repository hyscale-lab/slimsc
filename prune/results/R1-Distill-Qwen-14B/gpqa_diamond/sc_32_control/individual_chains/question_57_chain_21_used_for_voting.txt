Okay, so I have this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that scattering amplitude has both real and imaginary parts, and these are related to the phase shifts.

The given data are the phase shifts delta_0 to delta_4: 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13°. The rest are ignored, so I guess I only consider these five. The energy is 50 MeV electrons. The options are all in fm, which is femtometers. Wait, but I thought the scattering amplitude is usually in terms of something like cross-section or something else. Oh wait, the imaginary part relates to the cross-section somehow.

Wait, I recall that the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using the partial wave expansion. The formula I think is f(θ) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) * e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l ) * P_l(cosθ) ), where δ_l are the phase shifts, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials. But since we're looking along the incident beam direction, that would be θ=0°, right?

When θ is zero, cosθ is 1, so P_l(1) is 1 for all l because P_0=1, P_1(1)=1, P_2(1)= (3/4)(1) + ... Wait no, wait. The Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is equal to 1 for all l? No, wait, no. Because P_0(x)=1, P_1(x)=x, so P_1(1)=1. P_2(x)= (3x² -1)/2, so P_2(1)= (3*1 -1)/2= 1. Similarly, P_l(1)=1 for all l. Because when x=1, the polynomial reduces to 1. So that simplifies things a lot.

So then, f(θ=0) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) * e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l.

But wait, the imaginary part of f, Im(f), is what's needed. So let's think about that. The expression for f is the sum of terms. Each term is (2l+1) * e^{i δ_l} * sin δ_l * P_l(1), but since P_l(1)=1, it's just (2l+1) * e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

Let me expand each term. e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So when you multiply (2l+1) * e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l, that becomes (2l+1) [cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l ].

So when you sum all these terms, the real part is the sum of (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l, and the imaginary part is the sum of (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

So Im(f) = (1/k) * sum_{l}(2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Wait, but what is k? Because k is the wave number, and it relates to the wavelength. The electrons are 50 MeV, so I need to find their momentum, then k = p/ħ, perhaps. Let's think about the details.

First, the electrons have kinetic energy T = 50 MeV. The mass of an electron is m_e c² ≈ 0.511 MeV. So the kinetic energy is much larger than the rest mass, so relativistic effects are important. Wait, but maybe for the purpose of this calculation, we'll need to compute the momentum.

The relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_e c²)^2 ). But since E ≈ pc for high energies, but at 50 MeV, which is 50 MeV, and m_e c² is 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is about 98 times m_e c². So E ≈ p c. So E ≈ sqrt( (p c)^2 + (0.511)^2 ) ≈ p c, since p c is much larger than m_e c².

But for precise calculation, perhaps we should compute it properly.

So E = 50 MeV. E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2.

So (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 = (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ≈ 2500 - 0.261 ≈ 2499.739 (MeV)^2.

So pc ≈ sqrt(2499.739) ≈ approximately 49.997 MeV. So p ≈ (49.997 MeV) / c.

But wait, the unit of p is MeV/c. So we need to compute k, which is p / ħ.

But ħ has units of MeV s, or MeV·fm perhaps? Wait, let's recall the constants.

ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. But maybe it's easier to work in units where ħ c is known.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in inverse femtometers (fm^{-1}), since the answer is in fm.

We know that k = p / ħ.

Wait, but what's the value of ħ c in fm? Because ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm. So c is in fm/s, but perhaps the exact value is not needed because we're dealing with units that will cancel.

Let me think. The momentum p is (approx) 50 MeV/c. So p = 50 MeV / c.

k = p / ħ = (50 MeV / c) / ħ.

But ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm. So 1/(ħ c) is 1/(197.33 MeV fm).

So 1/ħ = (c) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) * (1/c) )? Wait, perhaps I should express everything in terms of ħ c.

Wait, let me write this again. I have k = p / ħ.

But p in MeV/c, and ħ in MeV s. So units: (MeV/c) / (MeV s) ) = 1/(c s) = 1/(s c).

But I need k in inverse femtometers. Since 1 fm = 1e-15 m, but perhaps I should use natural units where ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm. So 1/(ħ) = c/(197.33 MeV fm).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute k in terms of (1/fm) units.

We have k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / ħ.

But since ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm,

So ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

So substituting back, k = (50 MeV/(c)) ) / ( (197.33 MeV fm) / c ) )

The c's cancel, and MeV cancels, so:

k = 50 / 197.33 (1/fm) ) ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So k ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that makes sense because k is around 0.253 per fm. So 1/k is about 3.95 fm. Hmm, but let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 50 / 197.33.

50 / 200 is 0.25. So 50 / 197.33 is approximately 0.253.

Yes, so k ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So now, the imaginary part of f is (1/k) * sum_{l}(2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Wait, but wait: the sum is up to l=4 since the phase shifts given are up to delta_4.

So the possible l values are 0,1,2,3,4. Each with their respective delta_l.

So let's list the (2l+1) and sin²(delta_l) for each l.

For l=0: 2(0)+1=1. delta_0 is 90°, so sin(90)=1. So sin²=1. So term is 1*1=1.

l=1: 2*1+1=3. delta_1=67°, sin(67)≈0.9205 (exact value: sin(67) is approximately 0.9205). So sin^2 ≈ 0.8473. So term is 3 * 0.8473 ≈ 2.5419.

l=2: 2l+1=5. delta_2=55°, sin(55)≈0.8192, sin²≈0.6710. So term≈5 * 0.6710≈3.355.

l=3: 2*3+1=7. delta_3=30°, sin(30)=0.5, sin²=0.25. So term is 7 * 0.25 = 1.75.

l=4: 2*4+1=9. delta_4=13°, sin(13)≈0.22495, sin²≈0.0506. So term≈9 * 0.0506≈0.4554.

Now, sum all these terms.

Sum = 1 + 2.5419 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554.

Let me compute step by step.

1 + 2.5419 = 3.5419

3.5419 + 3.355 = 6.8969

6.8969 + 1.75 = 8.6469

8.6469 + 0.4554 ≈ 9.1023.

So the sum is approximately 9.1023.

Then, Im(f) = (1/k) * sum = (1/0.253) * 9.1023.

Compute 9.1023 / 0.253.

Hmm, 0.253 is approximately 0.25, so 9.1023 / 0.25 is about 36.409.

But let me compute it accurately.

0.253 * 36 = 9.108. Because 0.253 * 36= (0.25 *36)+(0.003 *36)=9 + 0.108=9.108.

But our sum is 9.1023, which is slightly less than 9.108.

So 36 would give 9.108, but we have 9.1023, which is 9.108 - 0.0057= 9.1023.

So 36 * (1 - 0.0057/9.108) ≈ 36*(1-0.000625) ≈ 36 * 0.999375 ≈ approx 35.978.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 9.1023 / 0.253.

Let me set up the division:

0.253 | 9.1023

Let me compute 0.253 * 36 = 9.108, as before.

But 9.1023 is 0.0057 less than 9.108, so 36 - (0.0057 / 0.253) ≈ 36 - (0.0225) ≈ 35.9775.

So approximately 35.9775 fm.

Wait, because 1/k is 1/(0.253 fm^{-1}) )= 3.9526 fm.

So 9.1023 * (3.9526 fm) ≈ let's compute 9 * 3.9526 = 35.5734, and 0.1023 *3.9526≈0.4047. So total is 35.5734 + 0.4047≈35.978 fm.

So Im(f) ≈35.978 fm.

Looking at the options, option B is 355.351 fm, which is about ten times larger. Hmm, did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second. Let me recheck the calculation because 35.978 is not among the options. The options are A) 87163, which is way larger, B) 355, C) 177, D) 251.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the factors somewhere. Let me go back.

Wait, the formula for Im(f) is (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

But is there a factor of 2 missing? Because sometimes in scattering theory, the partial wave expansion for f has a factor of (2l+1) in front, but perhaps I missed a factor.

Wait, I think I have it right. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: Are the phase shifts given in radians, or degrees? The question gives them in degrees, like 90°, 67°, etc. So when I compute sin(delta_l), I have to make sure they're in radians. Oh wait! I think I forgot to convert degrees to radians when calculating the sine.

Oh that's a crucial mistake. Because sin(67 degrees) is not the same as sin(67 radians). So I need to convert each delta_l from degrees to radians before computing the sine.

Let me redo the calculation with this correction. Oh man, that's a big mistake.

So each delta_l is in degrees. So I'll have to convert them to radians first.

Let me compute each term again with the correct angles in radians.

Compute each (2l+1) sin²(delta_l in radians):

l=0: delta_0=90° = π/2 radians ≈1.5708 rad.

sin(π/2)=1, so sin²=1. Term: 1 *1=1.

l=1: delta_1=67° = 1.16937 radians.

sin(1.16937)= approx 0.9205, same as before because 67 degrees is about 1.169 radians. So sin²=0.8473. Term=3 *0.8473=2.5419.

Wait, same as before. So for l=1, it's same.

Wait, wait, no, because 67° is about 1.16937 radians, but sin(1.16937) is same as sin(67 degrees), which is correct. So I think I didn't make a mistake here. So perhaps I was correct in the previous calculation.

Wait, no, wait, I think the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of k. Let me recheck that.

k = p / ħ.

But p is the momentum. Let me compute p correctly.

The electron's kinetic energy is 50 MeV. The total energy E = K + m_e c² =50 MeV + 0.511 MeV ≈50.511 MeV.

But for electrons, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2.

So (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 = (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2.

Compute (50.511)^2: 50^2 is 2500, 0.511^2≈0.261, and cross terms: 2 *50*0.511=51.1. So (50.511)^2≈ (50 +0.511)^2 ≈50² + 2*50*0.511 +0.511²≈2500 + 51.1 + 0.261≈2551.361.

Similarly, (0.511)^2≈0.261.

So (pc)^2≈2551.361 - 0.261 =2551.1.

So pc= sqrt(2551.1) ≈50.508 MeV.

So p= (50.508 MeV ) / c.

Then, ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

Thus, k = p / ħ = (50.508 MeV /c) / (197.33 MeV fm /c) ) = (50.508 /197.33 ) (1/fm ) ≈ 0.256 fm^{-1}.

So k ≈ 0.256 fm^{-1}.

Earlier, I had it as 0.253, but this is more precise. So 50.508/197.33 ≈ 0.256.

So 1/k ≈3.906 fm.

So now, the sum of the terms is approximately 9.1023 as before.

So Im(f) = sum/(k) = 9.1023 / 0.256 ≈ 35.59 fm.

Hmm, that's about 35.6 fm. But the options are B) 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times larger. So 35.5 is not matching any option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I forgot to multiply by a factor of 2 somewhere?

Wait, let me think about the formula again. The partial wave expansion is f(theta) = sum ( (2l+1)/(2k) ) e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l) P_l(cos theta).

Wait, wait, perhaps I missed a factor of (1/(2k)) instead of (1/k). Because I thought f(θ) = (1/k) sum ..., but perhaps it's (1/(2k)) sum ... ?

Wait, let me think. The partial wave expansion is f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ [ (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l) / (k) ] P_l(cosθ).

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l} [ (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l) ] P_l(cos theta).

So when theta=0, P_l(1)=1, so f(0) = (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l) ].

So the imaginary part is (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) sin²(delta_l) ].

Which is what I did before. So my calculation seems correct.

Hmm, but why is the result around 35.6 fm, and the options have B as 355.351 fm, which is 10 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion for k.

Wait, let me recompute k.

p = (50.508 MeV/c).

ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So k = p/(ħ) = (50.508 MeV/c) / (ħ) = (50.508 MeV/c) * (1/ħ).

But since ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm,

ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

So substituting:

k = (50.508 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV fm)/c ) )

The c in denominator and numerator cancels. MeV cancels.

So k= (50.508) / (197.33 fm^{-1} ) )= 50.508/(197.33) (1/fm).

50.508 / 197.33 ≈0.256.

Same as before. So 1/k ≈ 3.906 fm.

So Im(f) = 9.1023 * 3.906 ≈ 35.58 fm.

Which is about 35.6 fm. But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, let me recalculate the sum.

l=0: (2*0 +1)=1, delta=90°, sin^2=1. Term=1 *1=1.

l=1: 3, delta=67°, sin^2= sin^2(67°). Let me compute it precisely.

sin(67°) = sin(1.16937 radians) ≈0.9205.

So sin²=0.8473. Term=3 *0.8473=2.5419.

l=2: 5, delta=55°, sin(55)=0.8192. sin²=0.6710. Term=5*0.6710=3.355.

l=3:7, delta=30°, sin(30)=0.5. Term=7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:9, delta=13°, sin(13)=0.22495. sin²=0.0506. Term=9*0.0506≈0.4554.

Total sum: 1 + 2.5419 = 3.5419.

3.5419 +3.355=6.8969.

6.8969 +1.75=8.6469.

8.6469 +0.4554=9.1023.

So that's correct.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the phase shifts given are in units where the summation is over all l, and perhaps the given phase shifts are for higher l's. Wait, no, the question says to ignore the rest, so only consider up to l=4.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im(f) is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin^2 delta_l.

Wait, so I think I might have forgotten a factor of 1/2. Let's think. Because when I derived f(theta), I had f(theta) = sum_{l} [ (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l) / (2k) ] * P_l.

Wait, no, wait, let me check a textbook formula.

In scattering theory, the partial wave expansion is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ) / (k) * P_l(cosθ)

So the formula I used is correct. So no, I didn't miss a 1/2 factor.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the momentum p is not 50 MeV/c, but 50 MeV/(2m_e c^2), but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the kinetic energy is 50 MeV, so the momentum p is given by E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

Wait, let me recompute p.

E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 )

E = 50 MeV + 0.511 MeV ≈50.511 MeV.

So (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2 = (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2.

As before, 50.511^2 ≈ (50.5)^2 = 2550.25, but more accurately, 50.511 *50.511= ?

50.511 *50.511:

50 *50 =2500.

50 *0.511 =25.55 → 2*50*0.511 =51.1.

0.511^2≈0.261.

So (50.511)^2 = 50^2 + 2*50*0.511 +0.511^2 = 2500 +51.1 +0.261=2551.361.

(m c^2)^2 is (0.511)^2=0.261.

So (pc)^2=2551.361 - 0.261=2551.1.

So pc= sqrt(2551.1)= approximately 50.508 MeV.

So p=50.508 MeV / c.

Then, k = p / ħ = (50.508 MeV/c) / (ħ).

But ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So ħ= (197.33 MeV fm)/c.

Thus, k= (50.508 MeV /c ) / (197.33 MeV fm / c) )= (50.508)/(197.33) (1/fm) ≈0.256 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k≈3.906 fm.

So Im(f)= (sum) / k = 9.1023 * 3.906 ≈35.59 fm.

Hmm, but none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shifts. Let me think again.

Wait, looking back, the phase shifts given are delta_0=90°, delta_1=67°, delta_2=55°, delta_3=30°, delta_4=13°. So that's correct.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the question asks for the scattering amplitude in the lab frame, but perhaps I should have used the Mandelstam variable or some other frame. No, I think the formula is correct.

Wait, perhaps the imaginary part of the amplitude in the forward direction is related to the total cross-section. Oh, wait! The optical theorem says that the total cross-section sigma_total = 4π |f|^2, but the imaginary part of f(0) is related to the forward scattering amplitude, which is part of the total cross-section.

Wait, but in this question, it's not about the total cross-section, just the imaginary part at theta=0.

Wait, perhaps the options are given in units of something else, like 1/fm, but the correct calculation gives ~35.6 fm, which is not an option.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 355.351 fm, which is 10 times larger. Did I perhaps forget to multiply by 10? Or perhaps I missed a factor of 10 in the calculation.

Wait, where could that factor come from? Let me recheck the momentum.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the relativistic expression for the momentum correctly. Wait, let me compute p using E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ), so p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c.

E is 50 MeV. m c^2 is 0.511 MeV.

So p = (sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2 ) ) / c.

Wait, let me compute p correctly.

p = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) / c.

Compute that:

(50)^2 =2500, (0.511)^2≈0.261.

So sqrt(2500 -0.261)= sqrt(2499.739)≈49.997.

So p=49.997 MeV/c.

Earlier I had p=50.508 MeV/c, but that was when E=50.511 MeV. Wait, no, wait. The initial energy is 50 MeV, which is the kinetic energy. So total energy E = K + m c^2 =50 +0.511=50.511 MeV.

Thus, p= sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 )/c ≈ sqrt(2551.361 -0.261 )/c= sqrt(2551.1)/c ≈50.508 MeV/c.

So that's correct. So why am I getting 35.6 fm and the options don't have that?

Wait, let me think about the value of k again.

k= p/ħ = (50.508 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm/c ) )=50.508 /197.33 (1/fm ) ≈0.256 fm^-1.

So 1/k = 3.906 fm.

So Im(f)= sum * (1/k )=9.1023 *3.906≈35.59 fm.

Hmm. But the options are much larger. Perhaps the formula for Im(f) is sum (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l) / (2k).

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin^2(delta_l).

If that's the case, then Im(f)=9.1023/(2*0.256) =9.1023/(0.512)≈17.767 fm.

Which is option C) 177.675 fm. Wait, but 17.767 is not matching any option, except maybe option C is 177.675, which is 10 times larger. So another factor of 10 is missing.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units for k. Let me check if ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm or 197.33 MeV * 1e-15 m.

Wait, 1 fm = 1e-15 m. So ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm, so 197.33 MeV·1e-15 m.

But when I compute k, which is p/(ħ), but units must be handled carefully.

Wait, let me recompute k in terms of units where ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm.

p is 50.508 MeV/c. So, in units where c=1, p=50.508 MeV.

Wait, in natural units where ħ c=197.33 MeV fm, so 1 fm = ħ c / 197.33 MeV.

So 1 fm = (197.33 MeV fm) / 197.33 MeV ) )= fm, which is circular.

Alternatively, to get k in fm^{-1}, k = p/(ħ c) * (ħ c / ħ ) )= p/(ħ c) * c/ħ^{-1} ?

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using the correct unit conversions.

Let me think in terms of unit analysis.

k has units of inverse length, say inverse femtometers.

p has units of MeV/c.

ħ has units of MeV·s.

So to get k in fm^{-1}, we can write:

k = p / ħ.

But p is in MeV/c, so:

k = (MeV/c) / (MeV s) )= 1/(c s).

But we need to convert this to fm^{-1}.

We know that 1 fm = 1e-15 m.

1 m = 3e8 meters per second (c) * seconds. So 1e-15 m = 1e-15 m = (3e8 m/s) * (1e-15 s) )=3e-7 m.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the relation ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So 1 fm = (ħ c)/(197.33 MeV).

So 1/(ħ c) = 1/(197.33 MeV fm).

So k = p/(ħ) = (50.508 MeV/c ) / ħ.

But since ħ c =197.33 MeV fm,

ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

Substituting:

k= (50.508 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) )

The c cancels, MeV cancels, so:

k=50.508 /197.33 (1/fm) )=0.256 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k=3.906 fm.

So Im(f) = sum/(k) =9.1023 *3.906≈35.59 fm.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in some step.

Wait, looking back, the given options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

My calculation is about 35.59 fm, which is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for Im(f) is sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l), not sin²(delta_l). Let me check.

Wait, the partial wave expansion is f(theta)= sum (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l) P_l(cosθ)/(k).

So f(theta)= sum [ (2l+1) (cos delta_l + i sin delta_l) sin delta_l ) ] P_l /k.

Which is sum [ (2l+1) ( cos delta_l sin delta_l + i sin^2 delta_l ) ] P_l /k.

So the imaginary part is sum [ (2l+1) sin^2 delta_l ] /k * P_l.

But when theta=0, P_l=1 for all l, as we discussed.

So Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin² delta_l ] / k.

Which is what I did.

Wait, perhaps I should have used degrees in calculating sin, but I thought I already converted to radians.

Wait, let me think again: for l=1, delta=67 degrees. So in radians, that's 67*(pi/180)≈1.169 radians.

So sin(1.169) is indeed about 0.9205.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the phase shifts are given in degrees, but I should have used them in radians. Because if I compute sin(67 radians), which is about sin(383.8 degrees), which is sin(383.8-360)=sin(23.8 degrees)=0.403. So sin^2 would be 0.162, leading to a lower term. But that would make the sum smaller, leading to a lower Im(f), which isn't matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses delta_l in degrees, but that would be a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses delta_l in radians, but the given phases are in degrees. So I did the right thing converting to radians.

Wait, let me recompute the sum with the correct unit conversion, just to be sure.

l=0: delta=90°=pi/2 radians.

sin^2=1. Term=1*1=1.

l=1:67°=1.16937 rad.

sin(1.16937)=0.9205. sin²=0.8473. Term=3 *0.8473=2.5419.

l=2:55°=0.95993 rad.

sin(0.95993)=0.8192. sin²=0.6710. Term=5 *0.6710=3.355.

l=3:30=0.5236 rad.

sin=0.5. sin²=0.25. Term=7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:13°=0.22689 rad.

sin(0.22689)=0.22495. sin²=0.0506. Term=9 *0.0506=0.4554.

Sum: 1 +2.5419=3.5419; +3.355=6.8969; +1.75=8.6469; +0.4554=9.1023.

So yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the question uses a different formula, such as including additional terms or factors.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for f is f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} sin delta_l P_l.

Wait, but perhaps I should include the factor of 2 in the denominator. Wait, in some references, the partial wave expansion is written as f(theta) = (1/(2k)) sum ... ?

Wait, let me check. In scattering theory, the partial wave expansion is:

f(theta) = sum_{l=0}^∞ [ (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l) ] / (k) * P_l(cos theta).

But sometimes, I've seen it written with a 1/(2k) factor. Let me check Landau or another textbook.

Wait, another source says f(theta) = (1/k) sum_{l} (2l+1) [ (e^{2i delta_l} - 1)/ (2i) ] P_l(cos theta).

Which simplifies to (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) e^{i delta_l} P_l.

So my initial approach is correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. My calculation gives about 35.6 fm, but the options don't have that. The closest is option B) 355.351 fm, which is exactly 10 times larger.

So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere. Let me go back through the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the unit conversion for k. Let me recompute k.

Earlier, I thought that k = p / ħ, where p is in MeV/c, and ħ is in MeV s.

But wait, ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV s. So 6.582e-25 GeV s = 6.582e-25 * 1e9 eV s = 6.582e-16 eV s.

But 1 eV = 1e-6 MeV, so 6.582e-16 eV s = 6.582e-25 MeV s.

Wait, no, 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, so 1 eV = 1e-9 GeV.

Wait, let me compute ħ in units of MeV s.

ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s = 6.582e-25 * 1e9 eV·s =6.582e-16 eV·s.

But 1 eV =1e-6 MeV, so 6.582e-16 eV s=6.582e-22 MeV s.

So k = p / ħ = [50.508 MeV/c ] / [6.582e-22 MeV s ].

So this gives [ MeV/(c s) ].

But c is in m/s. So we need to convert units to get k in fm^{-1}.

Hmm, this approach is getting complicated.

Alternatively, using the relation ħ c =197.33 MeV fm.

So 1/(ħ c) = 1/(197.33 MeV fm).

So k = p/(ħ) = (50.508 MeV/c) / ħ.

But since ħ c =197.33 MeV fm,

1/ħ = c/(197.33 MeV fm).

Thus, k= (50.508 MeV/c) * (c)/(197.33 MeV fm ) )=50.508/(197.33) (1/fm ).

Which is 0.256 fm^{-1}, as before.

So no mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the electron's energy is 50 MeV, but it's a beam of electrons, so their rest mass is negligible. So perhaps I should have used p = E/c.

Wait, when E>>m c^2, p ≈ E/c.

So p =50 MeV/c.

But earlier, I computed p as 50.508 MeV/c because E=50.511 MeV.

But if we approximate p=50 MeV/c, then k=50/(197.33)≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k=3.952 fm.

Sum is 9.1023, so Im(f)=9.1023 *3.952≈35.98 fm.

Again, same result.

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are in radians, not degrees. Let me try computing the sum using delta_l in radians.

Wait, 90° is pi/2≈1.5708 rad.

sin(1.5708)=1.

So term=1*1=1.

delta_1=67 degrees=1.169 rad.

sin(1.169)=0.9205. So term=3*0.8473=2.5419.

Wait, same as before.

So that doesn't change anything.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is approximately 35.6 fm, but it's not one of the options. The closest option is B) 355.351 fm, which is 10 times larger. Did I miss a factor of 10?

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the scattering amplitude f is in units of fm, but perhaps the correct formula includes a factor of 1e-15 m somewhere. Let me think.

Wait, 1 fm = 1e-15 m.

But in the calculation, k is in fm^{-1}, so f would be in fm.

Wait, perhaps it's a unit conversion error. Let me think.

Wait, let me compute Im(f) in meters.

k =0.256 fm^{-1} = 0.256 / (1e-15 m )^{-1} )=0.256e15 1/m.

So 1/k=1/(0.256e15 1/m )= (1/0.256e15 ) m ≈ 3.906e-16 m.

So Im(f) = sum * (1/k )=9.1023 *3.906e-16 m≈3.558e-15 m.

But 1 fm=1e-15 m, so Im(f)=3.558e-15 m=3.558 fm.

Wait, now that's even smaller. But that's not matching any options.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the units of the scattering amplitude.

The scattering amplitude f has units of length (fm). The sum in the formula is dimensionless, so when multiplied by 1/k (which is in fm), the result is in fm.

So my initial calculation of ~35.6 fm must be correct.

But the options don't have that. Perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 355.351 fm, which is 10 times 35.535 fm. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere. Where could a factor of 10 come from?

Wait, perhaps I should have converted the phase shifts from degrees to radians correctly. Let me recheck.

Wait, for delta_1=67 degrees.

In radians: 67 * pi/180 ≈ 1.16937 radians.

sin(1.16937)= approx 0.9205.

So same as before.

Wait, but if I mistakenly took delta_1 as 67 radians, which is about 3838 degrees, but sin(67 radians) is approximately 0.403.

So sin^2=0.162.

Then, term=3*0.162=0.486.

Similarly, for other terms:

l=0:1*1=1.

l=1:3*(0.403)^2 ≈3*(0.162)=0.486.

l=2:5*(sin(55 radians))^2. 55 rad is about 3150 degrees. sin(55 rad)≈-0.942.

sin²=0.887. Term=5*0.887=4.435.

l=3:7*(sin(30 radians))². 30 rad≈1719 degrees. sin(30 rad)≈-0.817.

sin²=0.668. Term=7 *0.668=4.676.

l=4:9*(sin(13 radians))². 13 rad≈744 degrees. sin(13 rad)≈0.420.

sin²=0.176. Term=9*0.176=1.584.

Sum:1 +0.486=1.486 +4.435=5.921 +4.676=10.597 +1.584=12.181.

Im(f)=12.181 /0.256≈47.57 fm, which is still not matching any option.

So that's not the case.

Another possibility: Perhaps the given phase shifts are in units where the sum is multiplied by 2, but I don't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the real part, not the imaginary part. But the question clearly asks for the imaginary part.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I've made all the correct calculations, but I'm not getting any of the options. Perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the given options, the closest is option B) 355.351 fm, which is 10 times my calculated value. But I can't see where I might have missed a factor of 10.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the formula includes a factor of 2, making Im(f)=2 * sum /k.

If that's the case, then Im(f)=2 *9.1023 /0.256≈69.18 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula includes a factor of 2 in the sum, such as 2*(2l+1) sin^2 delta_l.

But no, the formula is correct as I derived.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses the relativistic relation with beta= v/c, but I don't think that would change the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the energy given is 50 MeV per nucleon or something else, but the question says 50 MeV electrons.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. My calculation leads me to approximately 35.6 fm, but the options don't have this. Since I can't find a mistake, perhaps the correct option is B) 355.351 fm, which is 10 times larger, implying I missed a factor of 10 somewhere. But I can't figure out where.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, but I don't see how that would result in option B.

Wait, wait, perhaps the formula uses delta_l in degrees, and I should compute sin(delta_l degrees) directly.

Let me compute the sum again, using degrees directly.

l=0: 90°, sin=1. Term=1.

l=1:67°, sin=0.9205. Term=3*(0.9205)^2=3*0.8473=2.5419.

l=2:55°, sin=0.8192. Term=5*(0.8192)^2=5*0.6710=3.355.

l=3:30°, sin=0.5. Term=7*(0.25)=1.75.

l=4:13°, sin=0.22495. Term=9*(0.22495)^2=9*0.0506≈0.4554.

Sum:1+2.5419=3.5419+3.355=6.8969+1.75=8.6469+0.4554=9.1023.

Then Im(f)=9.1023 *3.906≈35.59 fm.

Same result.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Based on my calculation, the correct answer isn't listed, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the magnitude of the amplitude, not the imaginary part. But no, the question specifies the imaginary part.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (sum) * (1/(2k)).

So 9.1023 * (1/(2*0.256)) )=9.1023/(0.512)≈17.767 fm.

Which would match option C) 177.675 fm if we have a factor of 10. But I don't see where that factor would come from.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered more phase shifts beyond l=4, but the question says to ignore the rest.

Hmm. I'm out of ideas. Based on my calculations, the correct answer should be around 35.6 fm, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option B) 355.351 fm, which is exactly 10 times larger. Maybe I missed a factor of 10 in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the unit conversion for k. Let me check again.

k= p / ħ.

p=50.508 MeV/c.

ħ= 6.582e-25 GeV s = 6.582e-25 * 1e9 eV s =6.582e-16 eV s.

But 1 eV=1e-6 MeV, so ħ=6.582e-22 MeV s.

So k= (50.508 MeV/c) / (6.582e-22 MeV s) )=50.508/(6.582e-22) * (1/(c s)).

But c is 3e8 m/s.

Hmm, perhaps to convert to fm^{-1}, I need to express k in terms of inverse femtometers.

1 fm=1e-15 m.

So 1/(c s)= (1 m/s )/(3e8 m/s * s ))= 1/(3e8 s ) )= 3.333e-9 s^{-1}.

But I'm getting stuck on the units.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relation ħc=197.33 MeV fm, so 1 fm= ħ c /197.33 MeV.

Thus, 1 fm^{-1} = 197.33 MeV / (ħ c).

So k = p/(ħ c) * (ħ c / ħ ) )= p/(ħ c) * c/ħ^{-1}?

Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute k in terms of 1/fm.

p=50 MeV/c.

So, k = p/(ħ) = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ).

But ħ c=197.33 MeV fm, so ħ= (197.33 MeV fm)/c.

So, k= (50 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV fm )/c ) )=50 /197.33 (1/fm )=0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k=3.952 fm.

Sum=9.1023, so Im(f)=9.1023 *3.952≈35.59 fm.

Hmm. I'm not seeing any error in this calculation. Therefore, I think the correct answer isn't among the options. But since I have to choose the closest option, perhaps option B is intended, but I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in including all the phase shifts. The question says to ignore the rest, so perhaps I should only consider up to a certain l. But no, the given phase shifts are up to l=4, which I included.

In conclusion, based on my calculation, the answer should be approximately 35.6 fm, but since it's not an option, I'm forced to choose the closest one, which isn't present. However, considering the options, the intended answer might be option B) 355.351 fm, but I can't see why.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we use the partial wave expansion formula for elastic scattering:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i\delta_l} \sin\delta_l P_l(1),
\]

where \(P_l(1) = 1\) for all \(l\), and the imaginary part of \(f(0)\) is given by:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \(k\)
The wave number \(k\) is related to the momentum \(p\) and \(\hbar\) by:

\[
k = \frac{p}{\hbar}.
\]

The momentum \(p\) is derived from the relativistic energy relation:

\[
E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Given the kinetic energy \(T = 50 \, \text{MeV}\) and the electron mass energy \(m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV}\), the total energy is:

\[
E = K + m_e c^2 = 50 + 0.511 = 50.511 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Solving for \(pc\):

\[
(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 = 50.511^2 - 0.511^2 \approx 2551.1 \, \text{MeV}^2,
\]

\[
pc = \sqrt{2551.1} \approx 50.508 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus, the momentum is:

\[
p = \frac{pc}{c} = 50.508 \, \text{MeV}/c.
\]

Using \(\hbar c = 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm}\), we find:

\[
k = \frac{p}{\hbar} = \frac{50.508}{197.33} \, \text{fm}^{-1} \approx 0.256 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

The inverse of \(k\) is:

\[
\frac{1}{k} \approx 3.906 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the sum \(\sum (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l\)
The phase shifts are given as \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), and \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\). The contributions to the sum are:

- For \(l=0\): \((2l+1) = 1\), \(\sin^2(90^\circ) = 1\), term = \(1 \cdot 1 = 1\).
- For \(l=1\): \((2l+1) = 3\), \(\sin^2(67^\circ) \approx 0.8473\), term = \(3 \cdot 0.8473 \approx 2.5419\).
- For \(l=2\): \((2l+1) = 5\), \(\sin^2(55^\circ) \approx 0.6710\), term = \(5 \cdot 0.6710 \approx 3.355\).
- For \(l=3\): \((2l+1) = 7\), \(\sin^2(30^\circ) = 0.25\), term = \(7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75\).
- For \(l=4\): \((2l+1) = 9\), \(\sin^2(13^\circ) \approx 0.0506\), term = \(9 \cdot 0.0506 \approx 0.4554\).

Summing these terms:

\[
\sum (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l = 1 + 2.5419 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 \approx 9.1023.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \(\text{Im}(f(0))\)
The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{k} \sum (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l = 9.1023 \cdot 3.906 \approx 35.59 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
The calculated value of \(\text{Im}(f(0)) \approx 35.59 \, \text{fm}\) does not match any of the provided options. The closest option is **B) 355.351 fm**, which is exactly 10 times larger. This discrepancy suggests a possible missing factor of 10 in the calculation or an issue with the problem's options.

### Conclusion
Based on the calculations, the correct answer should be approximately \(35.59 \, \text{fm}\), but since this is not an option, the closest match is:

**Answer: B**
