Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. 

The question is about a series of reactions, and I'm supposed to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, I remember that molecular symmetry groups are classified based on the types and numbers of symmetry operations they possess. So I need to figure out what E is first.

Let's go through each reaction one by one. 

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, A + 8B → C. I'm trying to think of compounds where a solid reacts with 8 equivalents of a gas. Wait, maybe it's something like sulfur reacting with something else? Or perhaps a metal reacting with a halogen? Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal complex. Bright red product... Oh, wait, I remember that when metals like copper react with certain things, they can form colored products. Or maybe it's about a reaction where a solid metal reacts with a diatomic gas, like chlorine or sulfur. 

Wait, another thought: lead(II) oxide (PbO) reacting with chlorine gas? Or perhaps it's the formation of a metal chloride. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction forming a compound with multiple atoms. Like, for example, Mg reacting with Cl2 would form MgCl2, but that's 2 equivalents. Wait, but here it's 8 equivalents. Hmm. Let me think. Maybe it's something like Fe reacting with Cl2? But FeCl3 would be 3 equivalents. Not 8.

Wait, another approach: looking at the second reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Then, C reacts with water to reform A plus two acids F and G, where F is strong and G is weak. So, perhaps C is a compound that, when hydrolyzed, gives back A and two acids. 

Let me think of a compound that when reacted with water gives two acids. For instance, maybe a sulfide, or maybe a nitride? Or perhaps a chloride. Wait, if C is a metal chloride, like AlCl3, but when AlCl3 reacts with water, it doesn't produce two acids. Alternatively, maybe a nitride: for example, Mg3N2 reacting with water gives Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that might not fit.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is a sulfide, like FeS. But when FeS reacts with water, it doesn't do much unless it's acidic. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another angle: the second reaction, C with gas D. If D is a halogen, like Cl2 or F2, but in that case, E would be a dihalide. Alternatively, perhaps D is something else. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide reacting with D, which is another gas. Let me think about the possibilities.

Wait, let me think about the first reaction again. If A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas, perhaps O2? But 8 equivalents would be a lot. Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2. For instance, perhaps A is copper (Cu), and B is Cl2. Cu reacts with Cl2 would form CuCl2. But wait, the stoichiometry. Copper has a valency of +2. So, for each mole of Cu, you need one mole of Cl2. So 1 equivalent. But in the problem, it's 8 equivalents. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is a transition metal with a higher valency. For example, if A is lead (Pb), and B is oxygen (O2). Lead(IV) oxide is PbO2. But how many equivalents would that take? Pb has a valency of +4. Each O2 molecule provides 2- charge. So, PbO2 would form from Pb and O2 in a ratio of 1 Pb : 2 O2 molecules. Because Pb is +4, each O is -2, so 2 O atoms give -4, balancing Pb^4+.

Wait, but in the first reaction, 8 equivalents of B. So, if B is O2, and the formula is PbO2, the stoichiometry is Pb + 2 O2 → PbO2. So, 2 equivalents of O2 per Pb. But the problem says 8 equivalents. That doesn't add up. Maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, perhaps A is something else. Another idea: maybe A is a metal and B is chlorine. For example, if A is sodium (Na), and B is Cl2. Sodium chloride (NaCl) would form with 1:1 ratio, but the problem says 8 equivalents. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but maybe A is an element that forms a compound with multiple atoms of B. For example, if A is Fe and B is O2, forming FeO. The reaction is Fe + O2 → FeO. The stoichiometry would be 1 Fe : 1 O2, because Fe is +2 and O is -2. But wait, FeO isn't very common; more common is Fe3O4. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's something like aluminum reacting with a diatomic gas. Al + Cl2 → AlCl3. The ratio is 1:3/2, but that's 3/2 equivalents, not 8. So maybe not.

Wait, perhaps B is a different gas. What about O3? Or maybe B is another diatomic gas like H2 or N2? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a complex with B. For example, maybe B is ammonia (NH3), but it's given as a gas. Wait, ammonia is a gas at room temperature. So, perhaps A is a transition metal, and B is NH3, forming a coordination compound. But I'm not sure how that would fit the 8 equivalents part. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction like Ni + NH3 → [Ni(NH3)6]^2+ or something. But in that case, the stoichiometry would be 6 equivalents of NH3 per Ni, perhaps. But the problem says 8 equivalents. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is something like the formation of a nitride. For example, magnesium reacts with nitrogen to form Mg3N2. The stoichiometry is Mg + N2 → Mg3N2. The ratio is 3 Mg : 1 N2. So 3 equivalents. But the problem says 8. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the product C is a compound that has a high number of B atoms. Like, maybe something with 8 B atoms per A. So, for example, if B is Cl, and C is ACl8. But that's a lot of Cl per metal. Let me think about metals that can have a +8 charge. Hmm, but most metals don't have +8 oxidation states. Maybe it's a transition metal with a high oxidation state. Alternatively, perhaps A is a nonmetal. For example, sulfur? No, sulfur is a nonmetal, but as a solid, maybe reacting with something else.

Alternatively, maybe A is carbon, but that's a stretch.

Wait, another thought. What if A is a metal and B is Cl2, and the product C is a metal chloride with a 8:1 ratio. For example, if A is a metal with a +2 charge, and B is Cl2, then each B molecule gives two Cl- ions. So, for 8 equivalents of Cl2, you'd have 16 Cl- per A. So the formula would be ACl8. But again, I don't think many metals form ACl8. Maybe something like FeCl8^4-? Not sure.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me look at the third reaction. C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So, when C is hydrolyzed, you get two different acids. Strong and weak. 

Strong acids are like HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak acids are like CH3COOH, HCN, H2S.

So, when C reacts with water, it produces two acids. One strong, one weak. Let's think what kind of compound would do that upon hydrolysis. Maybe a nitride? Wait, when nitrides react with water, they form NH3 (a weak base) and another acid. Wait, but that's not two acids. Alternatively, maybe a sulfide. Wait, sulfides reacting with water can produce H2S (a weak acid) and another acid, depending on the sulfide. Or perhaps a metal oxide.

Wait, another option: maybe C is a chloro compound. For example, if C is a chloroalkane, but that's probably not. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal chloride that, upon hydrolysis, produces HCl (a strong acid) and another acid. Hmm. Let me think, if C is a mixture or a complex.

Wait, another idea: maybe C is a metal carbide. For example, CaC2 reacts with water to form acetylene, but that's more about decomposition. Alternatively, maybe a metal carbonate? No, carbonates usually produce bicarbonates, CO2, and OH-.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. Let's think, when a nitride reacts with water. For example, AlN + H2O → Al(OH)3 + NH3. So Al(OH)3 is an amphoteric hydroxide. But in that case, you get a base (NH3) and a hydroxide (which can act as an acid). So maybe if the hydroxide is further treated, perhaps it forms an acid. Alternatively, maybe the hydroxide is a weak acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe C is a sulfide. For example, FeS reacting with water. But FeS is a solid that doesn't react with water unless it's in an acidic solution. Hmm. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: think about the second reaction, where C reacts with D. C + 2 D → E. E is extremely hazardous. So, E could be something like phosgene (but that's a gas), or perhaps a highly toxic compound like sarin gas, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, maybe E is a highly reactive compound like ozone (O3), but I don't think E is a gas here because the question says C reacts with D, which is a gas. So E would be a product. Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly reactive compound like HCN? Not sure.

Alternatively, think about E being a product of C and D. Let me think about possible reactions. For example, if C is a metal chloride and D is another chloride source, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide, and D is a halogen. Then E could be a halide oxide, but not sure.

Wait, perhaps D is H2O? No, because D is a gas, and H2O is a liquid under standard conditions. Unless D is steam, but that's a gas at high temperature.

Wait, another thought: the reaction between C and D produces E, which is extremely hazardous. Maybe E is a nerve agent or something, but perhaps in this context, E is something else. Alternatively, E could be a cyanide compound. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe E is a peroxide or an oxide. Another thought: maybe E is a compound with high symmetry, which is why the question is about its molecular symmetry group.

Let me try to approach this by considering the possible structures of E. The options are symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v. These are all point groups.

C2 is a two-fold rotation axis. D4h is a dihedral group with a four-fold rotation and horizontal mirror planes. D∞h is an infinite dihedral group, like in a linear molecule with multiple planes of symmetry. C2v has a two-fold rotation and a vertical mirror plane.

So if E has a certain structure, say, linear, it might belong to D∞h, like CO2 (linear, but actually CO2 is D∞h). Wait, no, CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. H2O has C2v symmetry. Something like O3 (ozone) has a bent structure with a C2v symmetry. Or maybe a planar molecule like benzene? No, benzene is D6h.

Wait, but E is formed from C and D. Let me think about possible E structures. If E is a linear molecule, it could have D∞h symmetry. For example, carbon dioxide is linear and has D∞h symmetry. But wait, carbon dioxide is a gas, and D is a gas. So if C is something that reacts with another gas D to form CO2, perhaps? Let me think.

Wait, if E is phosgene (COCl2), which is a gas, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps E is something like Cl2O7 (dichlorodioxygen), but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me try to get back to C. C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, perhaps when C is hydrolyzed, it produces both a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a chloro compound that, when hydrolyzed, produces HCl (strong acid) and another acid. For example, if C is something like CH2Cl2, but that doesn't hydrolyze to acids. Alternatively, maybe it's a chloroalkane that undergoes hydrolysis to form carboxylic acid and HCl, but that's more about substitution reactions, which would require specific conditions.

Wait, another angle: perhaps C is a metal chloride that can hydrolyze to form a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is a mixture of chlorides, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride, like Mg3N2. When Mg3N2 reacts with water, it produces Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another idea: what if C is a sulfide, like FeS? When FeS reacts with water, especially in acidic conditions, it can produce H2S (a weak acid) and Fe^2+ ions which form Fe(OH)2, which is a base. But that doesn't give two acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide, like Al2O3. When Al2O3 reacts with water, especially hot and concentrated, it can form Al(OH)3 and possibly some acidic solution, but Al(OH)3 is amphoteric. Not sure if that gives two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate. Wait, carbonates react with water to produce bicarbonate and CO2. But CO2 is a gas and a weak acid (it forms H2CO3). Hmm, but not sure how that fits.

Wait, perhaps C is a chlorate or some other complex. Another idea: if C is something like NH4Cl, but when it reacts with water, it just dissociates, doesn't produce acids.

Wait, maybe I should think about the acids F and G. Since F is strong and G is weak, possible combinations could be HCl (strong) and H2S (weak), but that would require C to be a compound that can produce both. Alternatively, H2SO4 (strong) and HCN (weak). Or maybe HNO3 (strong) and H2CO3 (weak). But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the reactions again. The first reaction is A + 8B → C. Second: C + 2D → E. Third: C + H2O → A + F + G. And D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, D + B → H (solvent).

So, let me think about D and B. If D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent, what could that be? Let's think of common solvents. For example, if B is H2O and D is another gas that reacts to form something. Wait, but B is a gas, and D is a gas. So their reaction forms a solvent, which is likely a liquid. For example, if B is O2 and D is H2, they could form H2O (a liquid, a solvent). But that's 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. So the ratio is 2:1. But the problem says 1:1. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is something else. Wait, if B is Cl2 and D is another gas like NH3, they could react to form HCl and NH2Cl? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is F2, and D is something else. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: B is O2, D is C (solid carbon), but D is a gas. So no. Alternatively, B is O2 and D is CH4, which when reacted in some way to form H2O, but that's not a 1:1 ratio. 2H2O needs 2 H2 and 1 O2. Not 1:1.

Alternatively, maybe B is H2 and D is something else. H2 is a gas. If D is another gas that reacts with H2 in 1:1 ratio to form a solvent. For example, CO2 and H2 reacting to form H2O? No, that's not a common reaction. Alternatively, maybe B is H2 and D is O2, but that reaction is 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O, so 2:1 ratio, not 1:1.

Wait, perhaps D is another diatomic gas. Let's think about H2O2. But H2O2 is a liquid, not a gas. Alternatively, O3 is a gas, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe B is NH3 and D is HCl gas. They would react in a 1:1 ratio to form NH4Cl, which is a solid. So that doesn't fit as a solvent. Alternatively, perhaps B is H2O and D is something else, but H2O is a liquid, not a gas. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is H2O in a gaseous state (like steam). Then, Cl2 + H2O → HClO + HCl. But that's an aqueous reaction, not a gas reaction. Also, the ratio is 1:1, but that's not forming a solvent, it's more of a solution.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck here. Let me try to think of another angle. Maybe the product E is something like phosgene (COCl2), which is a gas and highly toxic. Phosgene has a structure with a central carbon double-bonded to O and two Cl atoms. Its molecule is linear, so the point group would be D∞h. But wait, the options include D∞h as option C. So that could be a possibility.

But let's see how that fits into the reactions.

If E is COCl2, then in the second reaction, C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. So, C + 2 D → COCl2.

If D is Cl2, then perhaps C is something that reacts with Cl2 to form COCl2. Hmm, but what would C be? Wait, if C is CO (carbon monoxide), then CO + Cl2 → doesn't directly form COCl2. Alternatively, perhaps C is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chloroform or something. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, another approach: What is the structure of E? If E has a molecular symmetry group of D∞h, it's a linear molecule, like CO2, HCN, etc. So, perhaps E is a linear molecule.

CO2 has D∞h symmetry. So, if E is CO2, then the product of C and D would be CO2. But I'm not sure how that would fit the reactions.

Wait, but then in the third reaction, C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. If CO2 is E, then perhaps C is a carbonate or something. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps E is O3 (ozone), which has a bent structure and C2v symmetry. Ozone is a triatomic molecule with a central O and two O's on either side, making a bent structure. Its point group is C2v. So if E is O3, then its symmetry group would be C2v, which is option D.

But how would that fit into the reactions?

Let me see. If E is O3, then the second reaction is C + 2 D → O3. So, what could C and D be? Ozone can be formed by the reaction of oxygen with something else. For example, O2 + some energy can form O3, but that's just O2 converting into O3, which might not fit the 2D part. Alternatively, if C is O2 and D is O, but O is a diatomic gas. Alternatively, perhaps C is O2 and D is another oxygen source, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but then in the first reaction, A + 8B → C. If C is O2, then A and B would have to react to form O2. Hmm, perhaps A is a metal oxide and B is something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something else. Let me think about other E possibilities.

Another possibility is that E is a molecule with D4h symmetry. For example, something like SO2 has a bent structure but D∞h symmetry. Wait, no, SO2 is a bent molecule with a C2v symmetry. Hmm, wait, no. Actually, SO2 has a bent structure with a central sulfur atom double-bonded to two oxygens. Its point group is C2v because it has a two-fold rotation axis and a vertical mirror plane. So E could have C2v symmetry.

Alternatively, if E is a planar molecule with four-fold symmetry, perhaps like CH4? No, CH4 is tetrahedral, which has Td symmetry. Alternatively, benzene has D6h symmetry.

Wait, going back to the options, the possible symmetry groups are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

If E is a linear molecule, like CO2, then D∞h is the symmetry group (option C). If E is a bent molecule like H2O, then it's C2v (option D). If E is a molecule with a four-fold axis, like something with a square planar structure, it might be D4h.

Wait, perhaps E is a molecule like CH3CN (acetonitrile), which is linear and has D∞h symmetry. But I'm not sure how that fits the reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something like phosgene (COCl2), which is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. So if E is COCl2, then the symmetry group is D∞h, which is option C.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to piece it together again.

If E is COCl2, then the second reaction would be C + 2 D → COCl2.

So, perhaps D is Cl2, and C is something that reacts with Cl2 to form COCl2.

But wait, what is C? In the first reaction, A + 8B → C. If B is Cl2, then perhaps A is a metal that reacts with Cl2 to form a metal chloride, but I'm not sure how that would fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is CO (carbon monoxide), and D is Cl2. But CO + Cl2 doesn't directly form COCl2. They might undergo some reaction, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working. Let me think differently.

The third reaction: C reacts with water to produce A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a chloride of a metal that when hydrolyzed produces HCl (strong acid) and another acid. For example, if C is a chloro compound that hydrolyzes to form HCl and acetic acid (CH3COOH). But I'm not sure what C would be.

Alternatively, perhaps C is CCl4. When CCl4 reacts with water, it doesn't hydrolyze under normal conditions, but under certain conditions, it can produce HCl and ClCH2CH2Cl, which isn't an acid. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another idea: Maybe C is a chloroalkane, like CH2Cl2. But that doesn't hydrolyze to produce two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chloroarene, but that's probably beyond the scope.

Wait, maybe C is a chloro compound that upon hydrolysis produces two different acids. For instance, if C is a mixture of chlorides, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chloro compound that can undergo both SN1 and SN2 reactions, but that's more about mechanisms than products.

Wait, another angle: perhaps C is a carbonate. For example, MgCO3. When it reacts with water, it would decompose into Mg(OH)2 and CO2. CO2 is a weak acid (H2CO3), and Mg(OH)2 is a base. So that doesn't fit because F and G are both acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite. For example, CaSO3. When it reacts with water, it might form H2SO3 (weak acid) and Ca(OH)2 (base). Again, not two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate. Like CaSO4. Reacting with water, it might not hydrolyze much, but perhaps in acidic conditions, it could form H2SO4 (strong acid) and Ca^2+ ions. But that's only one acid, not two.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible structures of E and see which symmetry group fits.

If E is a linear molecule, D∞h (option C). If E is a bent molecule, C2v (option D). If E is a molecule with a four-fold symmetry, D4h (option B). Or a two-fold axis, C2 (option A).

Wait, another thought: E is a product of C and D, which is a gas. If E is a diatomic molecule, like O2 or Cl2, but those have different symmetry groups. O2 is linear with D∞h symmetry, Cl2 is linear with D∞h as well.

Wait, O2 has a linear structure, so its point group is D∞h. So if E is O2, then the symmetry group would be D∞h, which is option C.

But how would that fit the reactions?

Hmm. Let me try to think of a scenario where E is O2.

Wait, the second reaction is C + 2 D → E. If E is O2, then perhaps C and D are O-containing compounds. For example, maybe C is O3 (ozone) and D is O? Then, O3 + 2 O → 3 O2. But that's just a decomposition reaction, and I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps C is another form of oxygen, like O2 itself, but that would make E O2, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me try to think about the options again. The possible symmetry groups are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

If E is a linear molecule, it's either D∞h or C∞v. But D∞h includes a horizontal mirror plane, which CO2 has. So if E is something like CO2, its symmetry group is D∞h.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule like H2O, which is bent, it has C2v symmetry.

Wait, but H2O is a liquid, not a gas. The problem states that D is a gas. So E could be a gas as well.

Wait, another possibility: E is a molecule like SO2, which is bent and has C2v symmetry. SO2 is a gas. So if E is SO2, its symmetry group is C2v, which is option D.

But how would that fit into the reactions?

If E is SO2, then the second reaction is C + 2 D → SO2. So, what is C and D in that case?

Perhaps C is S (solid), and D is O2. Then, S + 2 O2 → SO2. But wait, the first reaction is A + 8B → C. If C is S, then A + 8B → S. So A is perhaps something reacting with 8 equivalents of B (gas) to form sulfur. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something else. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps C is SO3, a gas. Then, SO3 could react with something else to form SO2. But that's not matching the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps C is SOCl2, a liquid, but D would have to be something else.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about all the reactions together.

Let me try to outline what I know:

1. A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red)
2. C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous)
3. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
4. D + B (1:1) → H (solvent)

So, from reaction 4, D and B in 1:1 ratio produce a solvent. Solvents that are liquids, but D and B are gases. So, the reaction must form a liquid.

Wait, perhaps D is NH3 (a gas) and B is HCl (a gas). They react in 1:1 ratio to form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O (but it's a liquid under standard conditions, so unlikely. Unless it's steam, but then the reaction would be in gas phase). Let me think, if B is O2 and D is H2, then 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. Ratio is 2:1, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another idea: perhaps B is F2 and D is something else. F2 is a gas. If D is H2O, then F2 + H2O → 2 HF + O2. But that's a 1:1 ratio of F2 to H2O. So, the product would be HF, which is a weak acid, and O2. But that doesn't create a solvent. Alternatively, perhaps D is another gas that reacts with F2 to form something else.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2 and D is Cl2. But 1:1 ratio: H2 + Cl2 → 2 HCl. So, that's a 1:1 ratio. HCl is a gas, not a solvent. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps B is NH3 and D is HCl. They would react in a 1:1 ratio to form NH4Cl (a solid). Not a solvent.

Alternatively, perhaps B is CO2 and D is something else. Hmm.

Wait, maybe B is O2 and D is something like C (solid), but D is a gas, so maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2O (but it's a liquid, so can't be).

Alternatively, perhaps B is O3 and D is O. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that H is a common solvent, like water or ethanol. But since H is formed from D and B, which are gases, maybe H is H2O. So, D and B react to form H2O.

Wait, if H is H2O, then D + B → H2O. So, for example, H2 and O2 reacting in a 2:1 ratio to form H2O. But the problem states a 1:1 ratio, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is CH4 and D is Cl2. But I don't think that would form a solvent.

Wait, I'm stuck again. Let me try to think of the reactions again.

The third reaction produces two acids, F and G. F is strong, G is weak. Maybe F is HCl (strong) and G is HCN (weak). So, C must be a compound that, when hydrolyzed, produces both HCl and HCN. What compound would that be?

Hmm, perhaps C is ClCN? No, that's not a real compound. Alternatively, perhaps C is a chloro cyanide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitro compound. Wait, maybe not.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a chloro compound that, upon hydrolysis, produces HCl and another acid. For example, if C is CH2Cl2, but that doesn't hydrolyze to produce acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is a chloroalkyl ether, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps C is a compound like CH3COCl (acetyl chloride). When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to form CH3COOH (acetic acid, weak) and HCl (strong). That fits the description! So F is HCl (strong acid), G is CH3COOH (weak acid), and C is CH3COCl.

So, if C is CH3COCl (acetyl chloride), then in reaction 3, C + H2O → CH3COOH + HCl + HCl? Wait, no, the reaction would be CH3COCl + H2O → CH3COOH + HCl. So, only two products, the acid and HCl. But the problem states that two different acids are formed. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixture of two chlorides. Or maybe C is a compound that can hydrolyze to two different acids. For example, if C is something like ClCH2COCl, which could hydrolyze to HCl and HOOCCH2COOH? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chloro compound that releases two different acids upon hydrolysis. For instance, if C is ClCH2CH2Cl, which upon hydrolysis would produce HCl and HOCH2CH2OH (which is a weak acid). But then F would be HCl (strong), G would be glycolic acid (weak). That fits.

So, if C is ClCH2CH2Cl, then reaction 3 would produce HCl and HOCH2CH2OH. So F is HCl (strong), G is HOCH2CH2OH (weak). That works.

Now, reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (ClCH2CH2Cl). So, what is A? Maybe A is CH2CH2 (ethylene), but that's a gas. Alternatively, perhaps A is something else.

Wait, ClCH2CH2Cl can be prepared by the reaction of ethylene with excess Cl2. The addition of Cl2 to ethylene in the presence of light gives 1,2-dichloroethane. The reaction is CH2=CH2 + 2 Cl2 → ClCH2CH2Cl + 2 HCl. But in this case, the stoichiometry is 1 ethylene : 2 Cl2. So, 2 equivalents of Cl2.

But in reaction 1, it's 8 equivalents of B. So, if B is Cl2, then A must be something that reacts with 8 equivalents of Cl2 to form ClCH2CH2Cl. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps A is CH2CH3 (ethane), but that's a gas. Reacting ethane with Cl2 under certain conditions can form chlorinated ethanes, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a diol, like HOCH2CH2OH, and B is Cl2. But that doesn't fit as a solid.

Wait, maybe I'm on the wrong track with C being ClCH2CH2Cl. Let me think of another possibility.

Another thought: Maybe C is a chloro compound that hydrolyzes to produce HCl and another strong acid, but that's not possible because only one strong acid is mentioned.

Wait, perhaps C is something like CH3COCl. Reaction 3: CH3COCl + H2O → CH3COOH + HCl. So F is HCl (strong), G is CH3COOH (weak). But that's only two products, but the reaction produces HCl and CH3COOH, which are two acids. So that fits. So, C is CH3COCl.

Now, reaction 1: A + 8 B → CH3COCl.

So, what is A and B? CH3COCl can be made by the reaction of CH3COOH with SOCl2, but that's a different scenario. Alternatively, perhaps A is something else.

Wait, CH3COCl can be produced by the reaction of acetic anhydride with HCl, but that's not relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps it's made via the Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that's for aromatic compounds.

Alternatively, perhaps A is CH3COONa (sodium acetate), and B is HCl. Then, 8 equivalents of HCl reacting with sodium acetate would produce CH3COCl and NaCl. But the stoichiometry would be 1:1. So, 1 sodium acetate + 1 HCl → CH3COCl + NaCl. But the problem says 8 equivalents of B. So perhaps I'm not on the right track.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is a solid metal, and B is Cl2. For example, A could be a metal that reacts with Cl2 to form a metal chloride. But CH3COCl isn't a metal chloride, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong about C being CH3COCl. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chloro compound that produces two different acids upon hydrolysis. For example, if C is ClCH2CH2OH, but that's a glycol, not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a chloro compound that when hydrolyzed produces two different carboxylic acids. For example, if C is ClCH2COCl, which upon hydrolysis would produce HOOC-COOH (oxalic acid, weak) and HCl. But that's only two products, which would fit. So F is HCl (strong), G is oxalic acid (weak). So C would be ClCH2COCl.

But I'm not sure how that fits the first reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chloro compound derived from a diol. For example, if A is a diol, and B is Cl2, then the diol would react with Cl2 to form a dichloride. But then, the stoichiometry might not fit.

Wait, this is getting me nowhere. Let me try to think of E's symmetry.

If E is a linear molecule, options are D∞h or C∞v. But looking at the options, the choice is between C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

If E is a linear molecule like CO2, which has D∞h symmetry, then the answer would be option C: D∞h.

But how does that fit into the reactions? Let me try to imagine.

If E is CO2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → CO2. What could C and D be?

Perhaps C is CO, and D is something else. CO + 2 D → CO2. But I'm not sure what D would be.

Alternatively, perhaps C is CCl4 and D is O2. But CCl4 + 2 O2 → CO2 + 4 H2O? That's a combustion reaction, but I don't think that's likely.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonate that when reacted with D (another gas) forms CO2.

Wait, if C is CaCO3, and D is HCl gas. Then, CaCO3 + 2 HCl → CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O. So E would be CO2. That fits the second reaction. So C is CaCO3, D is HCl, E is CO2.

But wait, what about reaction 1? A + 8 B → C. If C is CaCO3, then A and B must react to form CaCO3. So, perhaps A is CaO (solid), and B is CO2 gas. Then, CaO + CO2 → CaCO3. The reaction is 1:1. But the problem states 8 equivalents of B. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not on the right track. Let me think again.

If E is O3 (ozone), which has C2v symmetry, then the symmetry group would be option D: C2v.

But how does that fit the reactions?

If E is O3, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → O3. So, what could C and D be? Ozone is formed by the reaction of oxygen with something else. For example, O2 + some energy → O3. But that's not involving two reactants. Alternatively, perhaps C is O2 and D is O, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps C is O2 and D is another gas that reacts to form O3. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is ClO and D is ClO, but that's speculative.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about the solvent H. If D and B form H, which is a solvent. Suppose H is H2O. Then, D and B must react to form H2O.

But as before, H2O is formed by 2H2 + O2, which is 2:1, not 1:1.

Alternatively, perhaps H is another solvent, like ethanol (but that would require B and D to form ethanol, which seems unlikely).

Wait, perhaps H is NH3. Then, D and B would react to form NH3. For example, if B is H2 and D is N2, but they don't react directly. Alternatively, perhaps B is NH3 and D is something else, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck again. Let me try to summarize what I think.

Based on the reactions, particularly reaction 3, C must be a chloro compound that, upon hydrolysis, produces a strong acid (like HCl) and a weak acid (like acetic acid). So, C is likely a chloro compound, such as CH3COCl.

In reaction 1, A and B react in 8:1 ratio to form C. If C is CH3COCl, then perhaps A is CH3COOH (acetic acid, but it's a liquid) and B is PCl5 or something else. But I'm not sure.

Reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. If C is CH3COCl, and D is something else, E could be CH3COOCl (but that's the same as C). Alternatively, perhaps D is another chlorinating agent.

Alternatively, perhaps E is phosgene (COCl2). So, if C is CH3COCl, and D is Cl2, then 2 Cl2 would react with C to form COCl2 and other products. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2O (chlorine monoxide), which is a linear molecule. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something else with a known symmetry.

Given the time I've spent and the information I have, I think the best bet is that E has D∞h symmetry, which would make the answer option C: D∞h. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, if E is a bent molecule, it would have C2v symmetry, making option D the answer.

Wait, another possibility: E is a molecule like SO2, which has C2v symmetry. So, if E is SO2, its symmetry group is C2v (option D).

But how does that fit? Let me see:

Reaction 2: C + 2 D → SO2.

If C is S (solid), and D is O2 gas. So, S + 2 O2 → SO2. But the first reaction is A + 8 B → C. So, A would be S, and B would be O2. Then, 8 equivalents of O2 reacting with S to form SO2. But that's not balanced. The reaction would be S + O2 → SO2 (1:1). So, 8 equivalents of O2 would produce 8 moles of SO2 from 8 moles of S. But A is a solid, so perhaps it's a larger quantity. Hmm, maybe that's possible.

Then, reaction 3: C (SO2) + H2O → A (S) + F and G. But SO2 hydrolyzes to form H2SO3 (weak acid) and possibly some H+ ions. But that doesn't fit because F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something like SOCl2, which when hydrolyzed produces HCl (strong acid) and H2SO3 (weak acid). So, reaction 3 would be SOCl2 + H2O → HCl + H2SO3 + S (maybe). But I'm not certain about the products.

In any case, if E is SO2, its symmetry group is C2v, which is option D.

But I'm not entirely certain. Given the options and the information, I think the most plausible answer is that E has D∞h symmetry, making option C the answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the identification of the molecular symmetry group of product E. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The stoichiometry and the nature of the reactants suggest that A and B are likely simple compounds, and C could be a chloro compound or a metal chloride. However, the exact identity of A and B remains unclear.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. The symmetry group of E depends on its molecular structure. The options provided include **C2**, **D4h**, **D∞h**, and **C2v**, which correspond to different molecular symmetry groups.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two different acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This suggests that C is likely a chloro compound that hydrolyzes to form a strong acid (e.g., HCl) and a weak acid (e.g., acetic acid or oxalic acid). For example, if C is CH3COCl (acetyl chloride), hydrolysis would yield CH3COOH (weak acid) and HCl (strong acid).

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This implies that D and B could be gases that react to form a liquid solvent, such as water (H2O). However, the exact identity of D and B remains ambiguous.

### Analysis of E's Molecular Symmetry Group:
- If E is a **linear molecule**, its symmetry group would be **D∞h**. Examples include CO2 and phosgene (COCl2). Phosgene is a plausible candidate for E, as it can be formed from a chloro compound like CH3COCl reacting with Cl2.
- If E is a **bent molecule**, its symmetry group would be **C2v**. Examples include SO2 and H2O. However, H2O is a liquid, not a gas, making it less likely.
- If E has a **four-fold rotational symmetry**, its symmetry group would be **D4h**, but no such molecule fits the context of the reactions.
- If E has a **two-fold rotational symmetry**, its symmetry group would be **C2**, but this is less likely given the options.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible scenario is that E is a linear molecule like phosgene (COCl2), which has **D∞h** symmetry. This aligns with the reactions and the provided options.

**Answer: C**
