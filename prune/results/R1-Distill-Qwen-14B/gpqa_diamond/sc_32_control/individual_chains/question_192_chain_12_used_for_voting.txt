Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me see. The question is about a spherical conductor with a cavity inside. The setup is that there's an uncharged spherical conductor, which means it's neutral to start with. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity, so that's an empty space within the conductor. The center of the cavity is separated by distance 's' from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is 'r', and it's smaller than the conductor's radius 'R'.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. The question asks about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the cavity's center is 'l', and both L and l are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

I remember that conductors have some properties regarding electric fields and charges. So, when a conductor is neutral, and a charge is placed inside a cavity, how does the conductor respond? Oh right, the conductor will have induced charges. The inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge equal and opposite to the charge inside the cavity. So if the cavity has +q, the inner surface must have -q. But since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface will have +q to balance.

Wait, but wait. The conductor was initially uncharged, so when you put +q inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface has +q. So the total charge on the conductor is zero, as it was before.

Now, the electric field outside the conductor. I remember that for a spherical conductor, the electric field outside depends only on the total charge enclosed within. So the field outside should be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. But wait, the conductor's total charge is +q on the outside, right?

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The conductor was neutral, so the inner cavity with +q induces a -q on the inner surface. Then the outer surface must have +q to balance. So the total charge on the conductor is zero, because the inner surface is -q, outer is +q. So the conductor's net charge is zero. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the conductor as a whole was uncharged, but when you add +q inside the cavity, the conductor must have overall +q? Or no, because the conductor's own charges rearrange.

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The conductor is neutral to start with. Then, when you put a charge +q inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must have a charge of -q (opposite to the enclosed charge). Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must then have a charge of +q. So the conductor as a whole has a net charge of zero? No, because initially it was neutral. Oh wait, the conductor's net charge is the sum of inner and outer charges. So inner is -q, outer is +q. So net is zero. Because the conductor was neutral, and you added +q inside the cavity.

Wait, no. Wait, I'm probably getting this wrong. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral. So the material's net charge is zero. When you put a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge of -q. Therefore, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to keep the conductor's net charge at zero. Because the conductor was neutral and you added +q inside the cavity, it's like the conductor's outer surface has +q, but the conductor's own material remains neutral. So the conductor's total is zero because inner is -q, outer is +q.

But the point P is outside the conductor, so the electric field there depends on the total charge enclosed within, which is the conductor's outer charge. So the electric field at P would be the same as if the +q was at the center of the conductor, due to the shell theorem. Because the outer shell's charge is +q, so the field outside is as if the charge is a point at the center.

Wait, but point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So the electric field E at P would be given by Coulomb's law: E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Because the charge +q is the only one contributing to the field at P. The inner charges (-q) are within the conductor, so their field outside the conductor doesn't affect the outer points.

Wait, but wait, the charge inside the cavity is +q. The inner surface of the conductor has -q, and the outer surface +q. So the total charge outside the conductor is +q. So the field at a point outside the conductor (like P) is due to this +q at the center. So the field is E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q) / L².

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that: (1/(4πε₀)) (q/L²). So the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but wait the point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, and l is larger than R. So the conductor is outside the cavity, but the point P is outside the conductor. Hmm, but wait, the conductor's radius is R, and since L is bigger than R, P is outside the conductor. So the field there is due to the +q on the outer surface, which is as if the charge is at the center of the conductor. So regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is, the external field only depends on the outer charge of the conductor.

Wait, but in the problem, the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, but the conductor's response is to have +q on the outer surface. So the position of the charge inside the cavity doesn't affect the external field, as long as it's inside. So the field outside depends only on the outer charge and the distance from the center.

So the angle theta and the position l (distance from P to the cavity's center) don't matter because the conductor's outer surface is spherical and the field outside depends only on L, the distance from the center of the conductor.

So the correct expression is option B.

The problem involves a neutral, uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity has a radius $r$ and is centered at a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and a distance $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor induces a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the induced charges. The electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor, which is $+q$, and not on the position of the charge inside the cavity.

Using the shell theorem, the electric field outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed and the distance from the center of the conductor. At point $P$, which is outside the conductor, the electric field is therefore given by Coulomb's law:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2},
\]

where $L$ is the distance from the center of the conductor to point $P$. The angle $\theta$, the distance $l$ from $P$ to the center of the cavity, and the separation $s$ between the centers of the conductor and the cavity do not affect the electric field outside the conductor, as the field depends only on the total charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
