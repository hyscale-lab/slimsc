Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question asks for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

First, let's tackle the relative speed. Wait, in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally because of the speed limit c. So I remember something about the velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), where u and v are the velocities of the two objects as observed from the rest frame. But wait, wait a second. Which astronaut's velocity are we taking as u and which as v?

Wait, the question is about their relative speed. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction, then from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c)(0.6c)/(c²)) ), but I'm not sure. Let me write that down.

Wait no, wait. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). But in this case, the velocities are both in the same direction, so u is 0.6c (Astronaut A's speed) and v is 0.5c (Astronaut B's speed). So when we say the relative speed of B from A's frame, it's (v - u) or (u - v), depending on direction. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think.

Wait, relative velocity. If A is moving at 0.6c, and B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, then from A's frame, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) divided by (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, so u is the velocity of B in the rest frame (0.5c) and v is the velocity of A in the rest frame (0.6c). No wait, no. Wait, the formula is for when you have one frame moving at velocity u relative to another, and an object moving at velocity v in the first frame. So if I'm in A's frame and I want to find B's speed, then the velocity addition formula applies. So from the rest frame, A is moving at 0.6c, B at 0.5c. So in A's frame, B's speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, that's ( -0.1c ) / (1 - (0.3 c²)/c² ) = (-0.1c)/(1-0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7. The magnitude is 0.1/0.7 c, which is approximately 0.1428c. So about 0.14c. But wait, another thing: the formula gives the relative velocity of B as seen from A. So the relative speed is 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c, so that's a start.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Each astronaut's energy is gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy, mc². So I'll need to compute gamma for each.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute for astronaut A first. His speed is 0.6c. So v^2 is (0.6c)^2 = 0.36 c². So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Square root of 0.64 is 0.8. So gamma is 1/(0.8) = 1.25.

Wait wait, no. Wait, 1 / sqrt(0.64) is 1/0.8, which is indeed 1.25. So for A, energy E_A is gamma * m_A c². Wait, m_A is 2m. So E_A = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Now for astronaut B, moving at 0.5c. So v^2 is 0.25 c². So 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. Square root is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.8660. So gamma is 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So E_B = gamma * m_B c². m_B is 3m. So E_B = 1.1547 * 3m c² = 3.464 m c².

Wait, let me compute that more precisely. 1.1547 * 3 is 3.4641. So E_A is 2.5 m c², E_B is about 3.464 m c². So total energy E_total is 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C has E = 5.96 mc² and v_rel = 0.14c. Option D has E=5mc². So in our case, the total energy is approximately 5.96, which would match option C.

Wait, but wait! Let me double-check the calculation of the energy. Did I make a mistake in the gamma values?

For A: v=0.6c. So v²=0.36 c². 1 - v²/c²=0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. So gamma=1/0.8=1.25. Correct.

E_A = gamma * m * c². Wait, no, wait, m is 2m, so E_A = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

B: v=0.5c. v²=0.25 c². 1 - 0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.8660. Gamma is 1/0.8660≈1.1547.

E_B = 1.1547 * 3m * c² = (3 * 1.1547) m c². 3 * 1.1547 is approximately 3.4641. So E_B ≈3.4641 m c².

Adding E_A and E_B: 2.5 +3.4641 =5.9641 m c². So about 5.96 mc². So the total energy is 5.96 mc², which matches option C. And from the relative speed calculation, it was around 0.14c.

So option C is v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². So that's the correct option.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system for two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. The astronauts have masses \(2m\) and \(3m\), traveling at \(0.6c\) and \(0.5c\), respectively, in the positive x-direction.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between the two astronauts is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]
Here, \(u = 0.6c\) (Astronaut A's speed) and \(v = 0.5c\) (Astronaut B's speed). Substituting these values:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} = -0.1428c
\]
The negative sign indicates the relative motion, but the magnitude of the relative speed is \(0.1428c\), which is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:
\[
E = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut A (\(2m\), \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut B (\(3m\), \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96mc^2\)**.
