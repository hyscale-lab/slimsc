Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about star compositions. Let me see what the question is asking. So, we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each with different masses. But the masses might not be directly relevant here since the question is about elemental abundances.

The problem gives us some abundance ratios using the EW method under LTE conditions. The given data are:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photosphere has:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5

We need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, we're looking for (nSi_1 / nSi_2).

Hmm, I remember that the brackets in these notations represent logarithmic abundance ratios. For example, [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. Or wait, wait—no, the definition is [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So, [X/Y] = log( (nX/nY) / (nX/nY)_sun )

So, first, let's parse the given values.

Starting with Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10( (nSi_1 / nFe_1) / (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) = 0.3

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log10( (nFe_1 / nH_1) / (nFe_sun / nH_sun) ) = 0 → So nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Since [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) relative to the Sun. So [Fe/H]_1 = 0 means that the ratio Fe/H for Star_1 is the same as the Sun. So nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Same with Star_2: [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → nMg_2 / nH_2 = nMg_sun / nH_sun.

So for Star_1, since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as the Sun. Similarly, Star_2's Mg abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun.

Let me jot down the Sun's values:

nFe_sun / nH_sun = 10^(-4.5) → because 12 + log10(...) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) =7.5-12 = -4.5.

nMg_sun /nH_sun = 10^(-5) → because 12 + log... =7 → log is -5.

So for Star_1:

nFe_1 /nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun = 1e-4.5.

And since [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, which is log10( (nSi_1 /nFe_1) / (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) ) ) =0.3.

Wait, let me re-express that. Let me compute nSi_1 /nFe_1.

Let me denote:

[Si/Fe] = log( (nSi/nFe) / (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) )

So 0.3 = log( (nSi_1 /nFe_1) / (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) )

Thus, (nSi_1/nFe_1) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But wait, nFe_1 is known in terms of nH_1. So perhaps I can find nSi_1 in terms of nH_1.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3.

So [Mg/Si] is log( (nMg_2/nSi_2)/(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) =0.3.

So (nMg_2/nSi_2) = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) * 10^0.3.

But for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2 /nH_2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun → nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH_2.

Hmm, perhaps I should express everything in terms of nH, and then find nSi_1 and nSi_2, then compute their ratio.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, Star_1:

Given that [Fe/H]_1 is 0 → nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) *nH_1.

So nFe_1 = (1e-4.5) *nH_1.

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → (nSi_1/nFe_1) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

We know nSi_sun /nFe_sun = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * (nH_sun /nFe_sun).

But wait, nSi_sun /nFe_sun is (nSi/nFe)_sun. From the Sun's data, we have nFe/nH =1e-4.5 and nMg/nH=1e-5. But what about nSi/nH?

Wait, the problem only gives us nFe and nMg for the Sun. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I need to express nSi in terms of nMg or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that in the Sun's photosphere, the abundance of Si is a known value. But wait, the problem doesn't provide [Si/Fe]_sun. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can express (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) as (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * (nH_sun /nFe_sun) = (nSi/nH)_sun * (nH/nFe)_sun.

We have nH/nFe = 1/(nFe/nH) = 1e4.5.

So (nSi/nFe)_sun = (nSi/nH)_sun * 1e4.5.

But I don't have the value of (nSi/nH)_sun. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should express all ratios in terms of the solar ratios.

Alternatively, perhaps the Sun's [Si/Fe] is what I can find.

Wait, perhaps [Fe/H]_sun is zero by definition. But the given [Fe/H]_1 is zero. Also, the Sun's [Mg/H] is zero by definition, as [Mg/H]_sun = 0.

Wait, but for the Sun, [X/H] is zero for all elements, because it's the reference. So [X/H]_sun =0 → (nX/nH)_sun = (nX/nH)_sun, which is given.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get back.

We know for the Sun:
nFe/nH = 1e-4.5
nMg/nH = 1e-5

But what about nSi/nH? The problem doesn't give that. Hmmm.

Wait, but perhaps we don't need nSi/nH for the Sun. Let me think about Star_1.

We have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (nSi_1 / nFe_1 ) = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun ) * 10^0.3.

But nFe_1 is known in terms of nH_1.

So, nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) * nH_1.

Similarly, nSi_1 can be expressed as (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *nH_1 * something?

Wait, perhaps I should instead express nSi_1 in terms of nH_1.

But without knowing (nSi_sun /nH_sun), I can't directly get that. So maybe I can relate it through [Si/Fe]_1 and the Sun's [Si/Fe].

Wait, [Si/Fe]_sun would be log( (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) / (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) ) =0. So, (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) is 10^0=1.

Wait, no. Because [X/Y] = log( (nX/nY) / (nX/nY)_sun ). So for the Sun, [X/Y]_sun =0 because the ratio is 1.

So [Si/Fe]_sun =0 → (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun )_sun → which is just the Sun's ratio.

But in any case, for Star_1:

nSi_1 / nFe_1 = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

But nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) *nH_1.

So,

nSi_1 = (nFe_1) * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

Substituting nFe_1:

nSi_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun * nH_1) ) * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

Simplify:

nSi_1 = (nH_1) * (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

The nFe_sun cancels out.

So,

nSi_1 = (nH_1) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *10^0.3.

Wait, that's neat. So, nSi_1 = (nH_1) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *10^0.3.

But again, I don't have (nSi_sun /nH_sun ), which is the solar silicon abundance.

Hmm, maybe I need to relate it to the Mg abundance or another element.

Wait, perhaps I can proceed with Star_2, see if that helps.

For Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log( (nMg_2 /nSi_2 ) / (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) ) =0.3.

So,

nMg_2 /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) *10^0.3.

Also, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) *nH_2.

So,

nMg_2 = (1e-5) *nH_2.

Because nMg_sun /nH_sun =1e-5.

Putting that into the [Mg/Si] equation:

( (1e-5) *nH_2 ) /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) *10^0.3.

But nMg_sun /nSi_sun = (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) * (nH_sun /nSi_sun ) = (1e-5) * (nH_sun /nSi_sun )

So,

(1e-5 *nH_2 ) /nSi_2 = (1e-5) * (nH_sun /nSi_sun ) ) *10^0.3.

Simplify:

nH_2 /nSi_2 = (nH_sun /nSi_sun ) *10^0.3.

So,

nSi_2 = (nH_2) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *10^(-0.3).

Wait, because if I re-arrange:

nSi_2 = (nH_2) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *10^(-0.3).

Hmm, that's interesting. Because for Star_1, we had:

nSi_1 = (nH_1) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *10^0.3.

So, nSi_1 is proportional to (nH_1) * 10^0.3, and nSi_2 is proportional to (nH_2) *10^-0.3.

But wait, the ratio we're looking for is nSi_1 /nSi_2.

So,

nSi_1 /nSi_2 = [ (nH_1) *10^0.3 / (nH_2) *10^-0.3 ) ] * ( (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) / (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ) → the solar terms cancel out.

So, the ratio becomes (nH_1 /nH_2 ) *10^(0.3 +0.3 ) → (nH_1 /nH_2 ) *10^0.6.

Wait, but what is nH_1 and nH_2? How do they relate?

Because the problem doesn't give any information about the total hydrogen in each star, I think we can assume that the hydrogen abundance (nH) is the same in both stars as a ratio? Or no, because the stars may have different metallicity.

Wait, but wait. The problem doesn't state anything about the total H, so perhaps we can assume that the H is the same between the two? Or perhaps H is part of the same photosphere, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, each star's H is in their own photosphere. So, nH_1 is the number density of H in Star_1, and nH_2 is that of Star_2.

But without knowing how they compare, how can we proceed?

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps the ratio (nH_1 /nH_2 ) can be determined from the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] data, but I don't see an immediate connection. Because [Fe/H]_1 is zero, meaning Star_1's Fe abundance is the same as the Sun. Wait, but [Fe/H] is a measure of the metallicity (Fe abundance relative to H). So, Star_1 has [Fe/H] =0 → same as the Sun. Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H] =0 → same as the Sun.

So, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe_1 /nH_1 =nFe_sun /nH_sun → which we know is 1e-4.5.

But for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 →nMg_2 /nH_2 =nMg_sun /nH_sun →1e-5.

But how does that help with nH_1 and nH_2?

Wait, perhaps the ratio of H between the stars can be found by considering other elements, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio (nH_1/nH_2) is 1, but that's probably incorrect unless the stars have the same H abundance, which isn't stated.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the problem again.

We need [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] for each star. The Sun's [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are zero, so Star_1's [Fe/H] is zero, implying that the Fe and H abundances are the same as the Sun. Similarly, Star_2's Mg/H is same as the Sun.

But without knowing how H varies between the stars, perhaps I can't find the ratio of H, but wait, maybe I don't need it. Let me see.

Wait, looking back, in the ratio nSi_1 /nSi_2, we have (nH_1 /nH_2) *10^0.6.

But if I don't know (nH_1/nH_2), I can't get the ratio. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the stars have the same H abundance, but that's an assumption. The problem doesn't state that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio (nH_1 /nH_2) can be determined from the given data.

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 →nMg_2/nH_2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun.

But what else can be used?

Wait, perhaps I can find the ratio (nH_1 /nH_2) by considering another element that both stars have, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't require us to consider the H ratio because it cancels out. Let me go back.

Wait, in the formula for nSi_1 /nSi_2:

(nH_1 /nH_2) *10^(0.6) = (nSi_1 /nSi_2).

But wait, unless (nH_1 /nH_2) is 1, because both stars have the same H, but I don't think that's given.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate.

Let me re-express nSi_1 and nSi_2.

For Star_1:

nSi_1 = (nH_1) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) * 10^0.3.

For Star_2:

nSi_2 = (nH_2 ) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) * 10^(-0.3).

So, nSi_1 /nSi_2 = [ (nH_1 /nH_2 ) *10^(0.3 - (-0.3) ) ] → because 10^0.3 /10^-0.3 =10^(0.6).

So,

nSi_1/nSi_2 = (nH_1 /nH_2 ) * 10^0.6.

But without knowing (nH_1/nH_2), I can't proceed. So perhaps the problem assumes that the H abundance is the same in both stars, which would make (nH_1/nH_2 )=1.

But that's an assumption. Let me see if that's valid.

Wait, the problem states that each star's [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are zero. So, Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0 → nFe_1 /nH_1 =nFe_sun /nH_sun.

Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0 →nMg_2 /nH_2 =nMg_sun /nH_sun.

But without knowing the H in each star, perhaps the H ratio can be found using another element.

Wait, maybe I can relate the H ratios using the abundances of another element that both stars have.

Wait, for Star_1, we have [Fe/H]=0, so nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) *nH_1.

For Star_2, [Mg/H]=0, so nMg_2= (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH_2.

But we can't directly relate nH_1 and nH_2 without another relation.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a key point here. Maybe the ratio (nH_1 /nH_2) can be determined by comparing the two stars' [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps the ratio between nH_1 and nH_2 can be found by considering the fact that the same element (like Fe or Mg) is present in both stars, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed without the H ratio, assuming it's 1, and see what the result is. It might be the intended solution.

Assuming nH_1 /nH_2 =1 → then,

nSi_1/nSi_2 =1 *10^0.6 ≈10^(0.6) ≈3.98 ~4.0.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which is close.

But wait, that's option A. But I'm not sure if I can assume nH_1 =nH_2. Because the problem doesn't state that.

Wait, but perhaps the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] being zero implies that the abundances are the same as the Sun. So, perhaps the H in each star is the same as the Sun. Wait, no, because [X/H] is the logarithm of (X/H) relative to the Sun. So, [X/H]=0 means X/H is the same as the Sun, but that doesn't necessarily mean the same number of H atoms. Wait, no. Because (nX/nH) = (nX_sun /nH_sun) ×10^([X/H]).

So, if [X/H] is zero, then nX/nH = nX_sun /nH_sun.

But that doesn't directly tell us about the total H in the star's photosphere. Because nH is the number density of hydrogen in the star, which could vary.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to proceed with the assumption that nH_1 =nH_2, but in reality, stars can have different H abundances. But without that info, perhaps that's the only way to proceed.

Assuming nH_1 =nH_2:

Then, nSi_1/nSi_2 =10^0.6 ≈3.98.

So, approximately 4.0. Which matches option A.

But let me check the other possibility. Suppose the H densities are different, but the problem gives us enough info to find the ratio.

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) ×nH_1.

For Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 →nMg_2= (nMg_sun /nH_sun) ×nH_2.

But can we find a relation between nH_1 and nH_2?

Hmm. Let's think about another element that both stars have. Wait, Star_1 has [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3, and Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2=0.3.

Wait, for Star_1, the [Fe/H] is zero, so nFe_1 /nH_1 =nFe_sun /nH_sun.

But for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0 →nMg_2 /nH_2 =nMg_sun /nH_sun.

But without a common element between the two stars, perhaps I can't relate nH_1 and nH_2.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the Sun's [Fe/Mg] is a certain value, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the ratio of H from Star_1 to Star_2 using another element. Let's think.

Wait, for Star_1: nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) ×nH_1.

For Star_2: nMg_2= (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) ×nH_2.

But H_sun is the same in both, so perhaps we can find a ratio.

But without a connection between Fe and Mg in the stars, perhaps this isn't helpful.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that [Fe/Mg] in the Sun is known, but it's not given here.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't require knowing the H ratio because the H cancels out in the ratio of Si.

Wait, looking back, the expression for nSi_1 and nSi_2:

nSi_1 = (nH_1) × (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ×10^0.3.

nSi_2 = (nH_2) × (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ×10^-0.3.

So, the ratio is (nH_1 /nH_2 ) ×10^0.6.

But without knowing (nH_1 /nH_2), I can't proceed. So perhaps the problem assumes that the H ratio is 1, leading to 10^0.6≈3.98, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio (nH_1 /nH_2) from the given data.

Wait, perhaps Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0, and Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0. But how to relate that to H.

Wait, perhaps for Star_1, nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) ×nH_1.

Similarly, for Star_2, nMg_2= (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) ×nH_2.

But without another equation, I can't relate nH_1 and nH_2.

Wait, perhaps I can relate [Fe/Mg]_1 and [Fe/Mg]_2, but that data isn't given.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to proceed without considering the H ratio, which would mean assuming it's the same, but that seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it is. Let me try to compute without considering the H ratio.

If the ratio nSi_1 /nSi_2 is (nH_1 /nH_2 ) *10^0.6, and if I don't have the (nH_1/nH_2) ratio, perhaps the problem expects us to find a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can express nH_1 and nH_2 in terms of another element.

Hmm, let me think: For Star_1, nH_1 can be found from nFe_1, since [Fe/H]_1=0.

nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) ×nH_1.

So, nH_1 = (nFe_1 ×nH_sun ) /nFe_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, nH_2 = (nMg_2 ×nH_sun ) /nMg_sun.

But without knowing nFe_1 or nMg_2, this doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the ratio (nH_1 /nH_2 ) in terms of Fe and Mg.

So,

nH_1 /nH_2 = (nFe_1 ×nH_sun /nFe_sun ) / (nMg_2 ×nH_sun /nMg_sun ) )

= (nFe_1 /nMg_2 ) × (nMg_sun /nFe_sun )

But I don't have nFe_1 or nMg_2.

Wait, perhaps I can find nFe_1 /nMg_2 ratio using [Fe/Mg]_1 and [Fe/Mg]_2.

Wait, but [Fe/Mg] for Star_1 isn't given. Only [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H].

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the [Fe/Mg] for Star_1 and Star_2.

Because [Fe/Mg] = [Fe/H] - [Mg/H].

Wait, no, because [Fe/Mg] = [Fe/H] - [Mg/H], but that's only under certain conditions. Wait, [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H].

So, [Fe/Mg] = [Fe/H] - [Mg/H].

Wait, for Star_1:

[Fe/Mg]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 - [Mg/H]_1.

But [Mg/H]_1 isn't given. Only [Si/Fe]_1 and [Fe/H]_1 are given. So that approach may not work.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 is given, but without [Si/Fe]_2, I can't find [Fe/Mg]_2.

Hmm. It's getting complicated, and perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem only requires the ratio of silicon in the two stars, without considering the absolute hydrogen. Maybe the ratio of silicon can be found without knowing the H ratio.

Wait, looking back, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → so (nSi_1 /nFe_1 ) = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) ×10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → (nMg_2 /nSi_2 )= (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) ×10^0.3.

But Star_2's [Mg/H]_2=0 → (nMg_2/nH_2 )= (nMg_sun /nH_sun ).

So,

nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) ×nH_2.

Putting that into the [Mg/Si] equation:

( (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) ×nH_2 ) /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) ×10^0.3.

Simplify:

nH_2 /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun )/ (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) ) ×10^0.3.

Which is:

nH_2 /nSi_2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ×10^0.3.

So,

nSi_2 = (nH_2 ) × (nH_sun /nSi_sun ) ×10^(-0.3).

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I can find (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) from the Sun's data.

Wait, in the Sun, nFe/nH =1e-4.5, and nMg/nH=1e-5.

But what about nSi/nH in the Sun? The problem doesn't provide that. Hmm. I might be stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I can express the ratio of Si in terms of the other elements. For example, for Star_1:

nSi_1 = (nFe_1 ) × (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) ×10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

nSi_2 = (nMg_2 ) × (nSi_sun /nMg_sun ) ×10^(-0.3).

But for Star_1, nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) ×nH_1.

For Star_2, nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) ×nH_2.

So,

nSi_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun ×nH_1 ) × (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) ×10^0.3.

nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun ×nH_2 ) × (nSi_sun /nMg_sun ) ×10^(-0.3).

Simplify:

nSi_1 = (nH_1 ) × (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ×10^0.3.

nSi_2 = (nH_2 ) × (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ×10^(-0.3).

So, the ratio is:

nSi_1 /nSi_2 = (nH_1 /nH_2 ) ×10^(0.3 +0.3 )

= (nH_1 /nH_2 ) ×10^0.6.

So, unless we can find (nH_1/nH_2 ), we can't compute this.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the hydrogen is the same in both stars. So, nH_1 =nH_2.

Thus, the ratio would be 10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is option A.

But I'm not entirely confident because the problem doesn't explicitly state that H is the same in both stars. However, given the information provided, perhaps that's the intended approach.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another way to find (nH_1 /nH_2 ).

Wait, perhaps using [Fe/H]_1 and [Mg/H]_2.

Wait, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1=0 →nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) ×nH_1.

For Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2=0 →nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) ×nH_2.

But how can I relate nH_1 and nH_2?

Hmm. Let me think about the total metallicity. But I don't have enough info.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the Sun's [Fe/Mg] is known, but that's not provided.

Wait, perhaps the star's [Fe/Mg] can be calculated.

For Star_1:

[Fe/Mg]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 - [Mg/H]_1.

But [Mg/H]_1 is not given. Only [Si/Fe]_1 and [Fe/H]_1 are given.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Fe/Mg]_2 = [Fe/H]_2 - [Mg/H]_2.

But [Fe/H]_2 is not given.

Hmm.

I'm stuck on how to find (nH_1 /nH_2 ). Without that, I can't find the ratio.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a key point. Let me re-express the problem.

We need the ratio (nSi_1 /nSi_2).

So, let me compute nSi_1 and nSi_2 in terms of the Sun's abundances and the given ratios.

But without knowing the H ratio, I can't proceed numerically.

Wait, perhaps I can express the ratio of the silicon abundances in terms of the given data and the solar abundances, but perhaps the H terms cancel out.

Wait, let me write down the expressions again.

nSi_1 = (nH_1 ) × (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ×10^0.3.

nSi_2 = (nH_2 ) × (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ×10^(-0.3).

So,

nSi_1 /nSi_2 = (nH_1 /nH_2 ) ×10^(0.6).

But without (nH_1/nH_2 ), I can't compute this.

Wait, perhaps I can find (nH_1/nH_2 ) by considering another element.

Wait, for Star_1:

nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) ×nH_1.

For Star_2:

nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) ×nH_2.

But I don't see a way to relate nFe_1 and nMg_2.

Wait, perhaps I can relate [Fe/Mg]_sun to the stars.

In the Sun, [Fe/Mg]_sun = log( (nFe_sun /nMg_sun ) / (nFe_sun /nMg_sun ) ) =0.

So, (nFe_sun /nMg_sun ) =1.

So, nFe_sun =nMg_sun.

Wait, the Sun's Fe and Mg are in the same ratio as the Earth's? Not necessarily, but according to the given data:

nFe_sun /nH_sun =1e-4.5.

nMg_sun /nH_sun =1e-5.

So, nMg_sun =1e-5 ×nH_sun.

nFe_sun =1e-4.5 ×nH_sun.

So, nFe_sun =nMg_sun × 10^(0.5).

Because 1e-4.5 is 1e-5 ×10^0.5.

So, nFe_sun =10^0.5 ×nMg_sun.

So, (nFe_sun /nMg_sun )=10^0.5.

Which means [Fe/Mg]_sun = log(10^0.5 )=0.5.

So, [Fe/Mg]_sun=0.5.

But how does that help with the stars?

Wait, if I can find [Fe/Mg]_1 and [Fe/Mg]_2, perhaps I can find a relation.

For Star_1:

nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) ×nH_1 =1e-4.5 ×nH_1.

nMg_1 = ?

Wait, but I don't have [Mg/H]_1. So, I can't directly find nMg_1.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0, so nMg_2 =1e-5 ×nH_2.

But without knowing how nH_1 and nH_2 relate, perhaps I can't proceed.

Hmm. I'm stuck again. Maybe the intended approach is to assume the same H abundance, leading to the ratio being 10^0.6≈3.98, so option A.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let's think about the possible options.

Looking at the options:

A) ~3.9 → approx 10^0.6 → which is what I get if nH_1 =nH_2.

Other options: C and D are less than 2, B is higher than 10.

So, given that, perhaps the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and apply the definitions of logarithmic abundance ratios.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → \( \log_{10} \left( \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1 / n_{\text{Fe}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot} / n_{\text{Fe}}_{\odot}} \right) = 0.3 \)
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → \( \frac{n_{\text{Fe}}_1}{n_{\text{H}}_1} = \frac{n_{\text{Fe}}_{\odot}}{n_{\text{H}}_{\odot}} \)

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → \( \log_{10} \left( \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_2 / n_{\text{Si}}_2}{n_{\text{Mg}}_{\odot} / n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot}} \right) = 0.3 \)
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → \( \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_2}{n_{\text{H}}_2} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_{\odot}}{n_{\text{H}}_{\odot}} \)

3. **Solar Photosphere**:
   - \( \frac{n_{\text{Fe}}_{\odot}}{n_{\text{H}}_{\odot}} = 10^{-4.5} \)
   - \( \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_{\odot}}{n_{\text{H}}_{\odot}} = 10^{-5} \)

### Analysis:
#### Step 1: Express \( n_{\text{Si}}_1 \) and \( n_{\text{Si}}_2 \) in terms of \( n_{\text{H}} \):
For **Star_1**:
- From [Fe/H]_1 = 0, \( n_{\text{Fe}}_1 = \left( \frac{n_{\text{Fe}}_{\odot}}{n_{\text{H}}_{\odot}} \right) n_{\text{H}}_1 = 10^{-4.5} n_{\text{H}}_1 \).
- From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Fe}}_1} = \left( \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot}}{n_{\text{Fe}}_{\odot}} \right) 10^{0.3}
  \]
  Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe}}_1 \):
  \[
  n_{\text{Si}}_1 = \left( 10^{-4.5} n_{\text{H}}_1 \right) \left( \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot}}{n_{\text{Fe}}_{\odot}} \right) 10^{0.3}
  \]

For **Star_2**:
- From [Mg/H]_2 = 0, \( n_{\text{Mg}}_2 = \left( \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_{\odot}}{n_{\text{H}}_{\odot}} \right) n_{\text{H}}_2 = 10^{-5} n_{\text{H}}_2 \).
- From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_2}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = \left( \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_{\odot}}{n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot}} \right) 10^{0.3}
  \]
  Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg}}_2 \):
  \[
  n_{\text{Si}}_2 = \left( 10^{-5} n_{\text{H}}_2 \right) \left( \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot}}{n_{\text{Mg}}_{\odot}} \right) 10^{-0.3}
  \]

#### Step 2: Ratio of Silicon Abundances:
The ratio of silicon atoms is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = \frac{\left( 10^{-4.5} n_{\text{H}}_1 \right) \left( \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot}}{n_{\text{Fe}}_{\odot}} \right) 10^{0.3}}{\left( 10^{-5} n_{\text{H}}_2 \right) \left( \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot}}{n_{\text{Mg}}_{\odot}} \right) 10^{-0.3}}
\]

Simplify:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = \frac{n_{\text{H}}_1}{n_{\text{H}}_2} \cdot \frac{\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot}}{n_{\text{Fe}}_{\odot}}}{\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot}}{n_{\text{Mg}}_{\odot}}} \cdot 10^{0.3 + 0.3}
\]

#### Step 3: Simplify Further:
- From the solar photosphere:
  \[
  \frac{\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot}}{n_{\text{Fe}}_{\odot}}}{\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot}}{n_{\text{Mg}}_{\odot}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_{\odot}}{n_{\text{Fe}}_{\odot}} = \frac{10^{-5}}{10^{-4.5}} = 10^{-0.5}
  \]

Thus:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = \frac{n_{\text{H}}_1}{n_{\text{H}}_2} \cdot 10^{-0.5} \cdot 10^{0.6} = \frac{n_{\text{H}}_1}{n_{\text{H}}_2} \cdot 10^{0.1}
\]

#### Step 4: Assume Equal Hydrogen Abundance:
If we assume \( n_{\text{H}}_1 = n_{\text{H}}_2 \), then:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = 10^{0.1} \approx 1.26
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **1.2**.
