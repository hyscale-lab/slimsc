Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me think through this.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, first, what's SMEFT again? From what I remember, SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the Standard Model's gauge symmetry. So it's a way to systematically include beyond-the-Standard-Model physics without committing to a specific new model.

Now, the symmetries. Let's list them one by one.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: This is the symmetry of special relativity, meaning the laws of physics are the same for all observers in inertial frames. In SMEFT, all operators must transform correctly under Lorentz transformations. So operators in SMEFT should be Lorentz scalars, I think. Because effective theories need to respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory, right? The Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, so SMEFT must too.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So it's the full symmetry of spacetime—rotations, boosts, and translations. But wait, I think Poincare includes the Lorentz group and translations. So if the operators respect Poincare, that includes Lorentz. But the question is about which of these the operators must respect. Do SMEFT operators need to respect Poincare?

Wait, no. Because SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, and effective theories are usually constructed to respect the symmetries of the original theory, which in this case is the Standard Model. The Standard Model respects Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT must as well. Because if you have a theory that's supposed to be an effective theory, it should respect the same fundamental symmetries as the original. So operators must respect Poincare symmetry.

Wait, but wait—I might be mixing up. Are Poincare symmetry and Lorentz symmetry separate? Because Poincare includes Lorentz plus translations. So if an operator respects Poincare symmetry, it must respect Lorentz. But the question is phrased as which symmetries must be respected.

Wait, but the question lists Lorentz and Poincare as separate options. So, the options are 1 and 2, which are Lorentz and Poincare. Do all SMEFT operators have to respect both?

Alternatively, perhaps only Lorentz symmetry is required, but Poincare is automatically satisfied because the operators are local. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what each symmetry entails. Poincare symmetry includes not just the Lorentz group but also the translations. So for the theory to have Poincare symmetry, the Lagrangian must be invariant under all Poincare transformations. That includes not just the fields but the way the operators are constructed.

In the case of SMEFT, the operators are local, so perhaps the theory already respects Poincare symmetry. So operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare? Or is it that Poincare is more general, and if you respect Poincare, you automatically respect Lorentz.

Wait, but the question is about which of the four options must be respected by all operators. So do all operators in SMEFT have to respect both Lorentz and Poincare, or just Lorentz or Poincare?

Wait, maybe I should think of the SMEFT approach. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all operators must be Lorentz scalars. But regarding Poincare, which includes translations, I'm not entirely sure. Wait, SMEFT is a field theory, so it must respect all the symmetries of the Standard Model, which includes Poincare. So yes, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry.

So 1 and 2 are required. Then the answer would include both 1 and 2.

Now, what about the other options, 3 and 4.

3. CP symmetry: CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. The Standard Model is not CP symmetric in general. For example, the CKM matrix has CP violation. So SMEFT can include operators that violate CP, right? So operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. So 3 is not a must.

4. CPT symmetry: CPT is Charge, Parity, Time reversal. The Standard Model, as far as I know, respects CPT symmetry. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

Wait, but wait: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. Every QFT that is Lorentz invariant must respect CPT symmetry. Because in a Lorentz-invariant theory, the combination of C, P, and T transformations must leave the theory invariant. So if a theory is Lorentz invariant, it must respect CPT.

So if SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, then it must respect CPT. So option 4 is a must.

So putting it all together:

Which symmetries must all operators respect? 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT).

Wait, wait. Because Poincare includes Lorentz. So if all operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. So perhaps the correct ones are Poincare and CPT.

Wait, no. The question gives options as 1,2,3,4. So I need to choose which of the given options are required.

So the options in the question are:

1. Lorentz Symmetry
2. Poincare symmetry
3. CP symmetry
4. CPT symmetry

So the correct symmetries are 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, but that would mean all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. But does Poincare symmetry imply Lorentz, so must we count both? Or perhaps the question is phrased such that the operators must respect each symmetry separately.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all operators must be Lorentz scalars. So 1 is definitely required.

As for Poincare, which includes translations, I'm not sure. Wait, Poincare symmetry is more than Lorentz. SMEFT is a theory that includes all possible terms that are compatible with the Standard Model gauge symmetry, but does it enforce Poincare symmetry? Because for a theory to be a valid QFT, it must respect Poincare. So yes, SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry. So operators must respect Poincare, which implies Lorentz symmetry. But the question is, which of the options must be respected by the operators. So both 1 and 2 are required.

So 1 (Lorentz) and 2 (Poincare) are both required, along with 4 (CPT).

Wait, but CPT is a consequence of Lorentz symmetry. So if the theory respects Lorentz, it must respect CPT. So if 1 is already correct, then 4 must also be correct.

So which of the options include 1,2, and 4?

Looking at the options:

Option C: 1,2,4 → which is Lorentz, Poincare, CPT.

Option D: 1,3,4 → Lorentz, CP, CPT. But I thought CP isn't necessarily required, as SMEFT can have CP violation.

So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but another angle: does the SMEFT require Poincare symmetry? Or just Lorentz and the others.

Wait, Poincare includes translations, which in a QFT, the theory must respect. So yes, SMEFT must respect Poincare, so operators must be invariant under Poincare, which includes Lorentz. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

So the correct set is 1, 2, and 4. So the answer is option C.

But wait, I'm a bit shaky on whether Poincare is strictly necessary beyond Lorentz, or if it's automatically satisfied.

Hmm. In the SMEFT, the operators are constructed as local operators. So each operator must transform as a scalar under Lorentz, which is part of Poincare. But for Poincare, the theory must also be invariant under translations. But the SMEFT is written in a way that it's invariant under translations because it's a local theory. So perhaps the operators, being part of a local theory, automatically respect Poincare symmetry.

Alternatively, if the question is about which symmetries do the operators need to individually respect, then perhaps only Lorentz and CPT are required.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to recall any notes or textbooks.

In the SMEFT, all operators must be consistent with the Standard Model symmetries, which include Lorentz, gauge, and possibly others like CPT. But do they need to respect Poincare?

Wait, Poincare symmetry is the combination of Lorentz and translation. So if SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory and a translation-invariant theory, then it's Poincare-invariant. But the question is whether the operators themselves are required to respect Poincare. Because the whole theory respects Poincare, but maybe each operator doesn't have to individually respect it.

Wait, no. Each operator must transform correctly under the symmetries of the theory. So for example, each operator must be a scalar under Lorentz. Because the theory is Lorentz-invariant. But for translations, each operator is a local operator, so they are inserted at a point, but the theory as a whole is invariant under translations because the Lagrangian is a sum of terms that are translation-invariant.

Wait, but maybe the individual operators don't have to be invariant under translations because the translation invariance is handled at the level of the Lagrangian. So perhaps the operators are not required to be translation-invariant on their own.

So perhaps the operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz scalars, and the entire theory respects Poincare, but individual operators don't necessarily have to. So in that case, only Lorentz is required, and CPT is a consequence of Lorentz, so must be respected.

Wait, but CPT is a separate symmetry. But in a Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT is automatically a symmetry. So if operators respect Lorentz, they automatically respect CPT.

So in that case, the operators must respect Lorentz and CPT.

Wait, but the question says which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So perhaps Lorentz and CPT.

But wait, the SMEFT can have operators that violate CP, but must they respect CPT? Because if a theory is Lorentz-invariant, it must respect CPT. So whether the operators individually respect CPT?

Hmm, maybe each operator must be a CPT eigenstate. Because, otherwise, the theory would not be CPT-invariant. Wait, but in practice, the SMEFT includes all possible operators, so perhaps some operators violate CP, but not CPT, because CPT is a symmetry of the theory.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think about this differently.

In the Standard Model, CPT is a symmetry. So any effective theory derived from the Standard Model must respect CPT. So SMEFT must respect CPT.

So regardless of whether operators respect individual symmetries like C or P, the combined CPT must be respected.

So yes, all operators must respect CPT.

So, to recap: all operators must respect Lorentz (so they are Lorentz scalars), Poincare, and CPT.

Wait, but do they have to respect Poincare? Because Poincare includes translations, and the SMEFT is a local theory, which respects translations. But perhaps each operator doesn't need to be invariant under translations, because the invariance comes from the fact that the Lagrangian is a sum of terms that are local and translation-invariant.

Hmm, perhaps each operator isn't required to individually respect Poincare symmetry, but the entire theory does.

So then, maybe the SMEFT operators only need to respect Lorentz and CPT. Because Poincare is more about the structure of the theory as a whole.

Wait, but the question says, "must be respected by all operators". So perhaps each operator must transform correctly under the symmetry. So for Lorentz, each operator must be a scalar. For CPT, each operator must be a scalar under CPT (assuming CPT is a symmetry).

Wait, but CPT is a combination of C, P, and T. So an operator might change under C, P, or T individually, but when all three are applied together, it remains the same.

But in any case, the key is that the theory as a whole must respect the symmetry, not necessarily each individual operator. Wait, but the question is about which symmetries each operator must respect. Hmm.

In the SMEFT, each operator is a local Lorentz scalar, so they must respect Lorentz symmetry. But do they have to respect Poincare? I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to think about which symmetries are required for the SMEFT to make sense. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, all operators must be Lorentz scalars. Also, since SMEFT is a quantum field theory, it must respect Poincare symmetry. So the operators must respect Poincare symmetry.

But wait, Poincare includes translations. Each operator is a local term, so they don't need to be invariant under translations because translation invariance is manifest in the Lagrangian's form. So perhaps the operators themselves don't need to transform in any particular way under translations, as the theory's translation invariance is part of the setup, not the individual operators.

In that case, perhaps the operators don't need to respect Poincare as a symmetry, but only Lorentz.

So, to sum up:

- Operators must be Lorentz scalars → Lorentz symmetry is required (1).
- SMEFT as a theory respects Poincare symmetry, but individual operators might not need to respect it beyond Lorentz.
- CPT symmetry is required because the theory is Lorentz-invariant, which implies CPT.

So the required symmetries for each operator are Lorentz (1) and CPT (4). Do they also need to respect Poincare (2)?

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Wait, but in the options, the only one that includes 1,2,4 is option C.

But I thought that Poincare is automatically handled because SMEFT is a local theory. So perhaps the answer is that operators must respect Lorentz and CPT, which would be options 1 and 4. But none of the options have only 1 and 4. Looking again:

Options:
A) 1,2 → Lorentz and Poincare
B) 3,4 → CP and CPT
C) 1,2,4 → Lorentz, Poincare, CPT
D) 1,3,4 → Lorentz, CP, CPT

Wait, so none of the options have only 1 and 4. So perhaps the correct answer is that operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

So the answer is option C.

But earlier I thought that Poincare might be automatically satisfied. But perhaps the SM EFT must respect Poincare, and so each operator must respect it.

I think the correct answer is option C: 1,2,4.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including all possible higher-dimensional operators that respect the Standard Model's gauge symmetry. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, meaning all operators must transform as Lorentz scalars. This is a fundamental requirement for the theory to respect the principles of special relativity. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. While the Standard Model and SMEFT respect Poincaré symmetry as a whole, the question specifically asks whether all operators must respect it individually. Since the SMEFT is a local theory, translation invariance is manifest at the level of the Lagrangian, and individual operators do not need to explicitly respect translations. Thus, Poincaré symmetry is not strictly required for individual operators beyond Lorentz symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model is not CP-symmetric due to phenomena like CP violation in the CKM matrix. SMEFT can include operators that violate CP symmetry, so CP symmetry is not a requirement for all operators.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, it must respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct combination of these symmetries is provided in **Option C**.
