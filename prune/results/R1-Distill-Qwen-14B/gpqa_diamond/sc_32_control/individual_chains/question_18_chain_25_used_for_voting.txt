Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each with masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. The question is asking about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that photospheres are the outer layers of stars where light is emitted, right? And elemental abundances are determined using some methods, like the EW method, which I'm not too familiar with, but maybe it's something to do with equivalent widths of spectral lines.

The given data includes some abundance ratios. For Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex, and [Fe/H]_1 is 0. For Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. The Sun's photosphere has [Fe/H] =7.5 and [Mg/H]=7, based on 12 + log10(nX/nH) values. Wait, so for the Sun, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5, which means log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5, right? Because 7.5 is 12 plus that log. Wait, no. Let me think: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5. Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7, so log is -5, nMg/nH=1e-5.

So the question is about [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si], and I need to find the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2's photospheres. Wait, the ratio is [Si/Fe] for Star_1 and [Mg/Si] for Star_2, but I'm not sure how that ties into the silicon ratio between the stars.

Wait, the question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So Si_1 / Si_2? Or Si_2 / Si_1? I need to clarify. The question says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So that would be (Si in Star_1) divided by (Si in Star_2), i.e., Si_1/Si_2.

Alright, so how do I approach this? I think I need to compute the abundance of silicon relative to hydrogen for each star, then take the ratio.

Wait, but the data given are [X/Y] ratios, which are log abundances. Let me recall: [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X and Y, relative to the Sun.

Given that, let's try to find [Si/H] for each star, then compute their ratio.

Starting with Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. And [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun. Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, that means that the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as in the Sun. So Fe in Star_1 is solar. So [Fe/H]_1 =0 → log(nFe1/nH1) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) =0 → log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) → so nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) =0.3. Since nFe1/nH1 is same as Sun, nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun)*nH1. So nSi1 = nFe1 * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun). Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's think in terms of the Sun's abundances.

Wait, the Sun's nFe/nH is 1e-5 * (10^0.5)? Because 12 + log(nFe/nH) is 7.5, which means log(nFe/nH)= -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5. Wait, 10^(-4.5) is 3.16e-5 yes.

So for Star_1, since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, the Fe abundance is the same as the Sun. So nFe1 / nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun. So nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH1. But since H can vary, but in the ratio, H is in denominator, perhaps it's easier to express in terms of [X/H] for each element.

Wait, but for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, so log(nFe/nH)_1 = log(nFe/nH)_sun. So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) = 0.3. So nSi1/nFe1 = 10^(0.3) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH1. So nSi1 = (nFe1) * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) = (nFe_sun/nH_sun * nH1) * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun )

The nFe_sun cancels out, so nSi1 = nH1 * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nH_sun )

But nSi_sun/nH_sun is the solar silicon-to-hydrogen ratio. Let's denote that as nSi_sun/nH_sun = s. So nSi1 = nH1 * 10^0.3 * s.

So the [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi1/nH1) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) = log(10^0.3 * s) - log(s) = 0.3. Because 10^0.3 * s is the argument of the log.

Wait, no, because s is nSi_sun/nH_sun. So nSi1/nH1 = 10^0.3 * s.

So [Si/H]_1 = log(10^0.3 * s) - log(s) = 0.3. So that's straightforward. So [Si/H]_1 is 0.3.

Wait, that makes sense. Because [Si/Fe] is 0.3, and Fe is solar, so Si is 0.3 dex higher than solar relative to Fe, which itself is solar relative to H. So Si is 0.3 dex higher than solar relative to H. So [Si/H]_1 is 0.3.

Now for Star_2. The given data are [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 dex and [Mg/H]_2=0.

So [Mg/H] is 0, meaning that nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

[Mg/Si]_2 = log(nMg2/nSi2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) =0.3 → nMg2/nSi2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

But nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) * nH2.

So (nMg_sun/nH_sun * nH2) / nSi2 =10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

Rearranged: nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun * nH2) / (10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )) 

Simplify: nSi2 = (nH2 / nH_sun) * (nMg_sun/nH_sun * nH2) ... Wait, perhaps I should handle it step by step.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express [Si/H]_2.

We have nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun → [Mg/H]_2 =0.

And [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) + 0.3.

So nMg2/nSi2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

But nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) * nH2.

So substituting, (nMg_sun/nH_sun * nH2) / nSi2 =10^0.3 (nMg_sun /nSi_sun).

Canceling nMg_sun from both sides:

(nH2 / nH_sun)/nSi2 = 10^0.3 (1/nSi_sun)

Rearranged: nSi2 = (nH2 / nH_sun) * (1/(10^0.3)) * nSi_sun.

So nSi2 = nH2 * (nSi_sun) / (nH_sun * 10^0.3 )

Which can be written as nSi2 = (nH2/nH_sun) * (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) * (nH_sun / 10^0.3 )

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of [Si/H]_2.

We have nMg2 = (nMg_sun / nH_sun) * nH2.

From [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3, nMg2/nSi2 =10^0.3 (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

So nSi2 = nMg2/(10^0.3 (nMg_sun/nSi_sun)).

Substituting nMg2:

nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun * nH2) / (10^0.3 (nMg_sun/nSi_sun)).

The nMg_sun cancels, so:

nSi2 = (nH2 / nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun / (10^0.3 )) 

So, nSi2 = (nH2 / nH_sun) * nSi_sun / 10^0.3.

So [Si/H]_2 = log(nSi2/nH2) - log(nSi_sun /nH_sun).

Substituting nSi2:

nSi2/nH2 = [ (nH2 /nH_sun) * nSi_sun /10^0.3 ] / nH2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) / 10^0.3.

So [Si/H]_2 = log( (nSi_sun/nH_sun) /10^0.3 ) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) )

Which is log( (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) - log(10^0.3 (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) → wait, no.

Wait, more accurately: [Si/H]_2 = log( (nSi2/nH2) ) - log( nSi_sun /nH_sun )

= log( (nSi_sun/(nH_sun *10^0.3) ) ) - log( nSi_sun /nH_sun )

= log(nSi_sun) - log(nH_sun) - log(10^0.3) - [ log(nSi_sun) - log(nH_sun) ]

= - log(10^0.3 )

= -0.3.

So [Si/H]_2 is -0.3.

So now, [Si/H]_1 is 0.3 and [Si/H]_2 is -0.3.

Wait, the question is about the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2. So (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH2/nSi2) ).

But using the [X/H] definition: [X/H] = log(nX/nH) - log(nX/nH)_sun.

So nX1/nH1 = 10^([X/H]_1 + log(nX/nH)_sun )

Similarly, nX2/nH2 =10^([X/H]_2 + log(nX/nH)_sun )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute nSi1/nH1 = 10^{ [Si/H]_1 } * (nSi_sun /nH_sun )

Similarly, nSi2/nH2 = 10^{ [Si/H]_2 } * (nSi_sun /nH_sun )

Wait, no. Because [Si/H] = log(nSi/nH) - log(nSi/nH)_sun.

So, nSi1/nH1 = 10^{ [Si/H]_1 + log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) }.

Wait, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, [X/H] = log(nX/nH) − log(nX/nH)_sun.

So, log(nX/nH) = [X/H] + log(nX/nH)_sun.

So, nX/nH = 10^{ [X/H] } × 10^{ log(nX/nH)_sun }.

But 10^{ log(nX/nH)_sun } is just nX/nH)_sun, because log(a) base 10 is the exponent you need to raise 10 to get a.

So, nX/nH = (nX/nH)_sun × 10^{ [X/H] }.

So, for Star_1: nSi1/nH1 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) ×10^{0.3}.

Star_2: nSi2/nH2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) ×10^{-0.3}.

We need the ratio (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) = [ (nSi_sun /nH_sun *10^0.3 ) ] / [ (nSi_sun /nH_sun *10^-0.3 ) ].

The (nSi_sun /nH_sun) terms cancel out. So, the ratio is 10^{0.3}/10^{-0.3} =10^{0.6}.

10^0.6 is approximately 3.98, which is about 4. So the ratio is around 3.98, which is approximately 3.9. So the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2 is about 4, which is option A.

To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given abundance data and use the relationships between elemental abundances.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
   - This implies that the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as in the Sun, i.e., [Fe/H]_1 = 0. Consequently, [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex
   - Since [Mg/H]_2 = 0, the abundance of Mg relative to H is the same as in the Sun. Using [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, we find that [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 dex.

3. **Solar Abundances**:
   - The Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
     - 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5
     - 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5

### Silicon Abundance Ratio:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is given by:

\[
\frac{\text{[Si in Star_1]}}{\text{[Si in Star_2]}} = \frac{\left(\frac{\text{Si}_1}{\text{H}_1}\right)}{\left(\frac{\text{Si}_2}{\text{H}_2}\right)} = \frac{\left(\frac{\text{Si}_1}{\text{H}_1}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\text{H}_2}{\text{Si}_2}\right)}{1}
\]

Using the definition of [X/H], we express the silicon-to-hydrogen ratios as:

\[
\frac{\text{Si}_1}{\text{H}_1} = 10^{\text{[Si/H]_1}} \cdot \left(\frac{\text{Si}_\odot}{\text{H}_\odot}\right), \quad \frac{\text{Si}_2}{\text{H}_2} = 10^{\text{[Si/H]_2}} \cdot \left(\frac{\text{Si}_\odot}{\text{H}_\odot}\right)
\]

The ratio simplifies to:

\[
\frac{\text{[Si in Star_1]}}{\text{[Si in Star_2]}} = \frac{10^{\text{[Si/H]_1}}}{10^{\text{[Si/H]_2}}} = 10^{\text{[Si/H]_1} - \text{[Si/H]_2}}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\text{[Si/H]_1} = 0.3, \quad \text{[Si/H]_2} = -0.3
\]

\[
\frac{\text{[Si in Star_1]}}{\text{[Si in Star_2]}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}
\]

### Calculation:
\[
10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \approx 3.9
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 to Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
