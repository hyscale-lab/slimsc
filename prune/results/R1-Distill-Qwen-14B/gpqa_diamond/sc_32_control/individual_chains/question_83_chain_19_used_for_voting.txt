Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titration calculations, but I'll give it a shot. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The given Ka for acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D.

Hmm. So, first, I should probably figure out the concentrations after dilution and then handle the titration points.

Wait, okay. Let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Diluting the acetic acid.

We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20.00 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³ or 0.04 liters.

The moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) before dilution would be Molarity × Volume. So, 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Since we're adding an equal volume of water, the new concentration is the same moles in double the volume. So concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Right? So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Step 2: Titration with 0.1 M NaOH.

We're titrating this acetic acid with NaOH. So, first, maybe I should find out the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid. The moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution is 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume (V) needed is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Now, the problem asks for pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

25% of the titration would mean 25% of the equivalence volume is added. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So up to 2.5 cm³ of NaOH have been added.

So let me handle each part.

First, pH at 25% titration.

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. Let me think about the reaction: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, initially, before adding any NaOH, the solution is just 0.025 M acetic acid. But when we add NaOH, which is a strong base, it will deprotonate the acetic acid.

But wait, when we add 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, how many moles is that? 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol of NaOH.

So the moles of acetic acid initially are 0.001 mol. Moles of NaOH added are 0.00025 mol.

So the reaction will consume 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH and produce 0.00025 mol of CH3COO^-.

So the remaining CH3COOH is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And the CH3COO^- is 0.00025 mol.

Now, the total volume is original solution (40 cm³) plus the added NaOH (2.5 cm³), so 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations will be:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = let's calculate that. 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approximately 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since this is a buffer solution (mix of weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait, pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. 1.85e-5 is about 1.85 ×10^-5. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) )

Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is approximately -0.477. So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. So about 4.26.

Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. So that's a candidate.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. [A^-]/[HA] is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3, but wait, the concentrations were 0.00025 mol in 0.0425 L, which gives 0.005882 M for A^-, and 0.017647 M for HA.

Wait, 0.00025 / 0.0425 is 25/42500, which is 0.005882 M; 0.00075 /0.0425 is 75/42500 → 0.017647 M. So yes, the ratio is 1/3. The log(1/3) is about -0.477. So yes, pH ≈4.733 -0.477 = 4.256 ≈4.26.

So the first value is 4.26. Looking at options, A is 4.26 and 8.52 as the two values.

Now, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO^-). The solution is now a solution of sodium acetate in water, which is a basic solution because acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid.

So, the moles of acetate are equal to the moles of acetic acid initially, which is 0.001 mol.

The total volume is original 40 cm³ + equivalence volume 10 cm³ → 50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, to find pH, I need to calculate the hydrolysis of acetate in water. The reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka. Since Ka is 1.85e-5, Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈5.405e-10.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, let me calculate that accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 → 1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405, so Kb ≈5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So we can set up the expression for Kb:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced. So:

Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² /0.02, since Kb is so small (5.4e-10), x will be much smaller than 0.02. So:

x² ≈ Kb *0.02 → x² = (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] is about 1.04e-5 M. Then pOH is -log(1.04e-5). log(1.04) is about 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) is 5.017. So pOH ≈4.983. Therefore, pH is 14 - 4.983 ≈9.017.

Wait, but wait a second. That can't be right. Because when I calculated the Kb, I thought the acetate is a weak base. Let me check the Kb calculation again.

Wait, Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) → 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 → approximately 0.5405 * 1e-9 → 5.405e-10.

Yes, that's correct. So Kb is 5.4e-10. So the calculation seems correct. Then why the pH is around 9.017? But that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73  

C) 4.73; 7.00

D) 4.57; 6.92  

Hmm. None of them have a pH near 9 at equivalence. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of moles at equivalence. Let me recheck.

Wait, the original solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid in 0.04 L, so moles are 0.001 mol. When we reach equivalence, all that acetic acid is converted into acetate. So the moles of acetate are 0.001 mol. The total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ =50 cm³ =0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 /0.05 =0.02 M. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is sodium acetate, which dissociates into Na+ and acetate. So acetate is 0.02 M.

Wait, another approach. The Kb is 5.4e-10. So using the formula for weak bases, the concentration of OH- is sqrt(Kb * C). So sqrt(5.4e-10 * 0.02) → sqrt(1.08e-11) ≈1.04e-5, as I did before. So [OH^-]≈1.04e-5 → pOH≈4.98 → pH≈9.02.

But none of the options have a pH near 9. So perhaps I made an error in the calculation.

Wait another thought: when adding the NaOH, perhaps I should consider the dilution more carefully.

Wait, but when I reach equivalence, the solution is a 0.02 M solution of CH3COO^- in 0.05 L. That's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Let me recheck.

Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb is 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, let me compute the pH again.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution isn't that straightforward. Let me compute the pH by setting up the equation without the approximation.

The Kb expression is:

Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 -x) → x² = Kb*(0.02 -x) → x² + Kb x - 0.02 Kb =0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-Kb ± sqrt(Kb² +4*0.02*Kb)}]/2.

But since Kb is so small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so x≈ sqrt(0.02 * Kb) → same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for Kb.

Kb = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = (1 /1.85 ) * 1e-9 ≈0.54054 *1e-9 → 5.4054e-10.

So x² = 0.02 *5.4054e-10 → 1.08108e-11 → x = sqrt(1.08108e-11) ≈1.04e-5 → [OH^-] =1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98, pH=9.02.

Hmm, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the solution is not just acetate. Wait, when you titrate acetic acid with NaOH, the equivalence point is when you have the salt of a weak acid and a strong base. So the solution should be basic, but perhaps I'm miscalculating the pH.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the pH of a salt solution.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the concentration of H+ ions from the acetate hydrolysis.

Another approach: The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. The Kb is 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-].

But since Kb is so small, the change in [CH3COO^-] is negligible, so [CH3COO^-] ≈0.02.

So, Kb ≈ (x)(x)/0.02 → x²=0.02 * Kb =0.02 *5.405e-10 =1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5 → [OH^-]=1.04e-5.

So pOH= -log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04)=0.017, so log(1.04e-5)=4.983. So pOH=4.983 → pH=14-4.983=9.017.

Still, that's about 9.02. But looking at the options, the equivalence point options are 8.52 (A), 6.73 (B), 7.00 (C), 6.92 (D). So none of them are near 9.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me go back.

Wait, wait. Wait, when you dilute the acetic acid, perhaps I made a mistake in the concentration calculation. Let me check.

Original volume: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles are 0.05 *0.02 =0.001 mol. Then diluted to 40 cm³, so concentration is 0.001 /0.04 =0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, but when adding NaOH, perhaps we should account for the dilution correctly. Let me think again.

At equivalence, the volume is 40 +10=50 cm³. So yes, 0.05 L.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the solution is not just acetate. Could I have made a mistake in considering the solution as a base?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH using the exact method for acetate ion.

Wait, the acetate ion comes from CH3COOH, which is a weak acid. So acetate is a weak base. So the pH should be basic, which implies pH>7.

But the options don't have anything near 9. So this suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement.

Wait, the problem states that we dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ water. So the diluted concentration is 0.025 M, as I thought.

Then, when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH at equivalence point again, but perhaps using a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that I considered the solution as 0.02 M acetate, but perhaps the actual calculation is different. Let me check.

Wait, 0.001 mol of acetate in 0.05 L is indeed 0.02 M.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the salt solution's pH using the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong base.

The pH at equivalence point can be calculated using:

pH = pKa + 1/2 (pKw - pKa)

Wait, no, that's for a different scenario. Let me think: For a salt of a weak acid and strong base (like Na acetate), the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion, which is a weak base. So the pH can be calculated using pOH = (pKb + log C)/2, but wait, no, the correct formula is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])? No, at equivalence, [base] is from the acetate and the [acid] is negligible, but for the buffer equation, at equivalence, the buffer has all been converted to the conjugate base.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a weak base:

pH = pKa + 1/2 (pKw - pKa) → wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think.

The formula for a weak base (like acetate) in solution is given by:

pOH = (pKb + log C)/2, but I think that's an approximation when C>> Kb. Let me check.

Alternatively, the pH can be found using:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

But at equivalence, [HA] is zero, which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the Kb as I did before and find the pH from that. But why am I getting a pH of around 9, which isn't matching any options?

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I added 20 cm³ of water, which is correct, but I should have considered the dilution of the titration solution as well. Wait, no, the initial solution is 40 cm³ before titration.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the Kb.

Wait, let me compute Kb accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1 /1.85) * 1e-9 → 0.54054e-9 → 5.4054e-10. That's correct.

So, with [CH3COO^-] =0.02 M.

Thus, the Kb is 5.4054e-10. So,

x² = Kb * C → 5.4054e-10 * 0.02 = 1.08108e-11 → x=√(1.08108e-11) ≈1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → let me compute this accurately.

Log(1.04) is approximately 0.017. So log(1.04e-5) is 5.017. So pOH=4.983. So pH=14-4.983=9.017.

Hmm. None of the options have an equivalence pH near 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem understanding.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is not about the equivalence point, but about the halfway point. Wait, no, equivalence is when all the acid is neutralized.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again to see if any option has 4.26 as the first pH and something around 8.5 as the second.

Looking at option A: 4.26; 8.52. So the equivalence pH is 8.52.

But according to my calculations, it's 9.02, which is higher. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is not at 25% of the total volume, but 25% of the NaOH required for equivalence. Oh, wait, that's what I did. Because 25% of the equivalence volume (10 cm³) is 2.5 cm³.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation at equivalence point, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb.

Wait, another approach: perhaps when the solution is at equivalence, the concentration is 0.02 M acetate, but perhaps I should calculate the pH using a more precise method, such as the exact solution of the quadratic equation.

So, Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) → x² = Kb (0.02 -x).

So, x² + Kb x - 0.02 Kb = 0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-Kb ± sqrt(Kb² +4*0.02*Kb)] / 2.

Plugging in Kb=5.4054e-10.

Let me calculate the discriminant: Kb² + 4*0.02*Kb → (5.4054e-10)^2 + 4*0.02*5.4054e-10.

Which is approximately (2.92e-19) + (4.3243e-11) → the second term is much larger, so sqrt ≈ sqrt(4.3243e-11) → approx 6.576e-6.

Thus, x ≈ [ -5.4054e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 → (6.5706e-6 ) / 2 ≈3.285e-6.

Wait, [OH^-] would be x=3.285e-6 → pOH= -log(3.285e-6) → log(3.285)≈0.516, so pOH≈5.484 → pH=14-5.484≈8.516.

Ah! So pH is approximately 8.52. Which matches option A's second value, 8.52.

Wait, that's different from the previous calculation. So why the discrepancy?

Because in the earlier approach, I approximated x as sqrt(Kb*C), assuming x << C. But in reality, when C is 0.02 and Kb is 5.4e-10, let's see: Kb*C=5.4e-10 *0.02=1.08e-11 → sqrt(1.08e-11)=1.04e-5, which is x. But in the quadratic solution, x is 3.285e-6, which is smaller than the approximation. Wait, wait a minute, that can't be. Because 3.285e-6 is smaller than 1.04e-5.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic approach. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the Kb is 5.4054e-10. So, using the quadratic equation:

x = [ -Kb + sqrt(Kb^2 +4*Kb*C) ] / 2.

Wait, because Kb is very small, the term Kb^2 is negligible compared to 4*Kb*C. So sqrt(4*Kb*C) is sqrt(4*(5.4054e-10)*0.02) = sqrt(4.3243e-11) → which is approximately 6.576e-6.

So x ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 → 3.288e-6.

Wait, that would give [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.484 → pH=8.516.

Which aligns with option A's second value of 8.52.

So why did my initial approximation give a different result?

Ah, because I thought x was sqrt(Kb*C), but that's only when x is much smaller than C. Wait, but in this case, sqrt(Kb*C) is 1.04e-5, which is much larger than Kb itself, but perhaps the approximation isn't valid.

Wait, perhaps I should not make the approximation because Kb*C is small but x could be significant compared to C. Wait, no, 1.04e-5 is much smaller than 0.02 (which is 2e-2). So why is the quadratic method giving a different value?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the quadratic approach.

Let me re-calculate.

The equation is x² = Kb (0.02 - x).

We can rearrange to x² + Kb x - 0.02 Kb =0.

The quadratic formula says x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² +4ac) ] / 2a.

In this equation, a=1, b=Kb, c= -0.02 Kb.

So, discriminant D = Kb² +4*(1)*(0.02 Kb) = Kb (Kb + 0.08).

But Kb is 5.4054e-10, so Kb + 0.08 is approximately 0.08.

Thus, D ≈ 5.4054e-10 *0.08 → 4.3243e-11.

sqrt(D) ≈ 6.576e-6.

Thus, x = [ -5.4054e-10 +6.576e-6 ] / 2 → (6.576e-6 -5.4054e-10 ) is approximately 6.576e-6. So x ≈3.288e-6.

So [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.484 → pH=8.516. So about 8.52.

Ah, so that's correct. So the equivalence pH is approximately 8.52, which matches option A's second value.

So earlier when I thought I had 9.02, I must have made a mistake in the approach, perhaps confusing the Kb and Ka or something like that.

Wait, why the discrepancy between the two methods? Oh, because when I didn't account for the x in the denominator properly, perhaps. So using the exact quadratic approach gives a more accurate result, leading to pH of about 8.52.

So, putting it all together: at 25% titration, the pH is 4.26, and at equivalence, it's 8.52. So the correct option is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first determine the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial solution contains 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid, which contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Titration and Equivalence Point
The acetic acid is titrated with 0.1 M NaOH. At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized to form acetate ions. The moles of NaOH required are equal to the moles of acetic acid:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The volume of NaOH required is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Molarity of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm³}.
\]

At the equivalence point, the total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 10.00 \, \text{cm³} = 50.00 \, \text{cm³} = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetate} = \frac{\text{Moles of acetate}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.05 \, \text{L}} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The pH at the equivalence point is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \( K_b \), which is related to the acid dissociation constant \( K_a \) of acetic acid (\( K_a = 1.85 \times 10^{-5} \)):

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} = 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the expression for \( K_b \):

\[
K_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}.
\]

Let \([OH^-] = x\). Then:

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} = 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log{[OH^-]} = -\log{(1.04 \times 10^{-5})} \approx 4.98.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, this value does not match any of the options. Re-evaluating the quadratic solution for \( x \) gives a more accurate result:

\[
x = \frac{-K_b + \sqrt{K_b^2 + 4 \cdot K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}}{2}.
\]

Substituting \( K_b = 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \) and \( [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = 0.02 \, \text{M} \):

\[
x = \frac{-5.405 \times 10^{-10} + \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10})^2 + 4 \cdot (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02}}{2}.
\]

The discriminant is dominated by the second term:

\[
\sqrt{4 \cdot (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02} = \sqrt{4.324 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 6.576 \times 10^{-6}.
\]

Thus:

\[
x \approx \frac{6.576 \times 10^{-6}}{2} = 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log{(3.288 \times 10^{-6})} \approx 5.48,
\]

and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume (10 cm³) of NaOH is added, corresponding to:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH added} = 0.25 \cdot 10 \, \text{cm³} = 2.5 \, \text{cm³}.
\]

The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \cdot 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with an equal amount of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]

and forming:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 2.5 \, \text{cm³} = 42.50 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log{\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right)}.
\]

The \( pK_a \) is:

\[
pK_a = -\log{(1.85 \times 10^{-5})} \approx 4.733.
\]

The ratio is:

\[
\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} = \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \approx 0.333.
\]

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log{(0.333)} \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. These values match option **A**.
