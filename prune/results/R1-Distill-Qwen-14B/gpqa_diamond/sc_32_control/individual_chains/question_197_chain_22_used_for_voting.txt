Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product. The options are A, B, C, D. 

First, I should look at the spectroscopic data given for Compound X. The IR and NMR data will help me figure out the structure of Compound X, which is the starting material. Then, I'll think about what reaction occurs when a compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI. 

Let me start with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region. That usually suggests either an O-H stretch or an N-H stretch. But looking at the options, all of them are either benzoic acids or substituted benzene rings. So, O-H makes more sense here, like a carboxylic acid. The peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which fits with a carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks are probably aromatic C=C stretches. 

Now, the 1H NMR data. Let's break it down:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm is typical for an -OH proton, especially in a carboxylic acid. So, this supports the IR data indicating a carboxylic acid group.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are two doublets each integrating to 2H. This suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because, in para substitution, the two protons on each adjacent carbon are equivalent and split into doublets. So the aromatic region tells me it's a para-substituted benzene, like p-methyl, p-ethyl, etc., but more importantly, the substituents are in the para positions.

Looking at the downfield region:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating for 1H. This might be a methylene group next to something electronegative, maybe adjacent to a carbonyl. Or perhaps a CH group in a branched chain.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, this time for 2H. This could be a CH2 group adjacent to another CH or a carbonyl. Like in a propyl chain or a branching.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet of 3H. A methyl group attached to something, perhaps a CH group. For example, in an isobutyl group, the methyl attached to the CH would split into a doublet because of coupling with the adjacent CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating to 3H. This is a terminal methyl group, probably from an ethyl chain. Like in an ethyl group (CH2CH3), the terminal methyl is a triplet because it's next to a CH2.

Putting this together, the NMR suggests a structure with a benzene ring (para substitution), a carboxylic acid group, and a side chain attached. Let me try to piece this together.

So the aromatic region has two doublets, meaning two substituents para to each other. One substituent is a methyl or ethyl, and the other is a side chain. Wait, no, maybe the substituents are a methyl and another group.

Wait, the 10.5 ppm is the -OH of the carboxylic acid. So the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group in one para position and another substituent in the opposite position.

So, the substituents on the benzene are a COOH group and something else. Let's think about the other substituent.

Looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group adjacent to the COOH. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be adjacent to that, perhaps a CH2 group. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH(CH3), and the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a CH2CH3 group.

Wait, that's the ethyl group. So maybe the substituent is a propyl chain with a branching. Let's think:

Perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH2CH3 group attached via a CH group. Or maybe it's a butyl group of some sort.

Wait, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to the CH group, which is at 2.9 ppm. Then, the CH group is attached to a methyl group at 1.4 ppm (d,3H). And the end of the chain is a CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm, t).

Let me draw this: the substituent on the benzene is a group like -CH2-CH2-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something. Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl chain with a branch. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. No, that doesn't fit. Wait, no, the COOH is on the benzene ring.

Wait, another approach: the substituent is a side chain attached to the benzene ring. The NMR shows a CH at 2.9, which suggests that it's connected to a CH2 and another CH3 group, perhaps in a branching.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an isobutyl group. Let me see: isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, wait, no: isobutyl is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) something? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.

Alternatively, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Sec-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, the structure I'm thinking is benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a substituent which is a sec-butyl group.

Wait, the substituent's NMR: the 2.9 ppm is a CH group attached to another CH2 and a CH(CH3) group. Let me try to diagram this.

Suppose the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something. Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let me see:

The substituent could be -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. That would be a pentyl group? Wait, no, that's four carbons. Alternatively, maybe it's a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a isobutyl group. Isobutyl is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, wait, isobutyl is -(CH2)2CH(CH3). No, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, no, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the substituent's structure.

The substituent attached to the benzene ring (para to the COOH) must have a chain that leads to an ethyl group (0.9 ppm, t). So the substituent could be a butyl group, perhaps with a branch.

Looking at the NMR:

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is likely a CH2 group adjacent to another CH group (at 2.9 ppm). So perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- group attached to the benzene. Wait, that would form a substituent like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. But how does that tie into the whole structure.

Wait, the substituent is a pentyl group? Or maybe it's a tertiary butyl group.

Alternatively, considering the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Wait, but that would be a substituent like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but with branching. Let me think: The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl adjacent to a CH (the 2.9 ppm). The 1.7 ppm is a CH2 attached to the CH.

So putting it together, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH(CH3))-CH2CH3? No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach. Let me see the options. The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, looking at the options, the starting compound is a benzoic acid derivative. Because IR has 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl, and the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is the acidic -OH.

So, options C and A are benzoic acids. Options B and D are substituted benzene rings without the carboxylic acid (they are just aryl compounds with substituents).

So, since the IR and NMR indicate a carboxylic acid, the starting compound must be either option A or C.

Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That would have a benzene ring with an ethyl group in the para position relative to the propanoic acid group.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would have a sec-butyl group attached at the para position relative to the COOH group.

Wait, but let me think about the NMR.

In option A, 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would have a structure where benzene is attached to a propanoic acid group. The benzene substituents are ethyl and propanoic acid in para positions.

But in the NMR, the substituent on the benzene (other than the COOH) would be an ethyl group. Let me consider the NMR for option A.

In option A, the substituent is ethyl (CH2CH3) attached to the benzene in para position. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which is what we have in the NMR (8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm). That fits.

But what about the other parts of the NMR? The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would be the CH next to the carbonyl. In propanoic acid, the structure is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. No, wait, I'm getting mixed up. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2-COOH. Wait, but that's not correct. No, in option A it's 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So the benzene is attached to a propanoic acid group as the substituent. Wait, that would make the structure: the benzene has a substituent that's a propanoic acid group at position 2, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the benzene is attached to the propanoic acid at the alpha position. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a propanoic acid group at position 4.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is benzene with a substituent at position 4 being an ethyl group and at position 2 being a propanoic acid.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, let me think about the substituent in option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So the structure is benzene ring with a COOH group in position 4 and a sec-butyl group in position 4? Wait, no, position 1 would be the COOH, and the substituent would be in position 4. Wait, no, position 4 relative to the COOH. So the substituent (sec-butyl) is attached to the benzene in the para position relative to the COOH.

So the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let me think about the structure of a sec-butyl group: it's a four-carbon chain where the substituent is attached to the second carbon. So structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, the sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but attached to the benzene.

Wait, no, the sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)CH2? No, wait, no. Let me correct: the butyl group has four carbons. sec-Butyl is when the substituent is on the second carbon of a four-carbon chain. So the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)2? No, wait, maybe it's -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)2, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it. The sec-butyl group is a four-carbon group where the point of attachment is on the second carbon. So it's CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. But how many carbons? The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So the group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's only three carbons, which can't be right. Wait, no, butyl is four carbons. So sec-butyl would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's only three carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, that is three carbons. Oh wait, no. Butyl is four carbons. So the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. But that's only three carbons; perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps it's -(CH2)2CH(CH3), but that would be isobutyl.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The butyl group has four carbons. The substituent can be primary, secondary, or tertiary. So:

- Primary butyl: -CH2CH2CH2CH2-
- Secondary butyl: -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-
Wait, no, that's only three carbons. Alternatively, a secondary butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH2-) but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-. But I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-. So it's attached to the benzene at the second carbon of a four-carbon chain. So the structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, that doesn't sound right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3), but that would be a three-carbon substituent, which doesn't fit butyl.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let's think again about the NMR.

In the NMR, the substituent has a CH at 2.9 ppm, a CH2 at 1.7 ppm, a CH3 at 1.4 (d), and a CH2CH3 at 0.9 (t). So, the substituent chain must look something like this: the CH is connected to a CH2, which is connected to a CH(CH3), which is connected to a CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group. But that would be a four-carbon chain with a branch. Wait, that would be a pentyl group? No, wait, four carbons: -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. That would be a pentyl group, but maybe that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let's see: -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. No, that's four carbons, so butyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a isopropyl group attached to a CH2. So like -CH2-CH(CH3)2. But that would be a propyl group with a branch. Alternatively, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)2CH(CH3) group. Let's see: the CH2 at 1.7 ppm would be the middle CH2, the CH at 2.9 would be the CH adjacent to the benzene, and the CH(CH3) would be the next group, followed by a CH2CH3. No, that might not fit.

Wait, let me approach this differently. The substituent must have a terminal ethyl group (the 0.9 ppm triplet). So it's likely an ethyl group at the end of a chain.

So, the substituent is something like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that would imply branching. Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, another thought: the substituent is a pentyl group, but I don't think any of the options suggest that.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene, then the structure would be:

Benzene ring with COOH at position 1, and the substituent at position 4 is a sec-butyl group. So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene.

Wait, but that's a four-carbon group. Let me see, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's only three carbons. Hmm.

Wait, no. A sec-butyl group is a four-carbon substituent. So the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)2. No, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the substituent being a butyl group with a branch. So, substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. Then, the chain would be:

Benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3. But that's a four-carbon substituent, so it's a butyl group. But where's the branching?

Wait, maybe the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-. So the substituent is attached to the benzene at the second carbon of a four-carbon chain. So it's a secondary butyl group.

So, the structure would be:

Benzene ring with COOH at position 4, and the substituent at position 4 is a sec-butyl group. So, substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but that would be a four-carbon substituent with a branch, which matches the NMR.

Let me go back to the NMR. The substituent's signals are:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): this is a CH group, which in the substituent would be the CH attached to the benzene. So, that's the first carbon after the benzene.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): the next CH2 group.

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): a CH3 group attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): a CH2CH3 group.

So, the substituent chain is: CH (at 2.9 ppm) connected to CH2 (1.7 ppm) connected to CH(CH3) (1.4 ppm d) connected to CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm t).

Wait, that would make the substituent: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3? No, that's a pentyl group with a branch. Alternatively, the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Wait, maybe it's a 3-methylbutyl group? Because 3-methylbutyl would have a branch at the third carbon. Let me see:

3-methylbutyl group: CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3. But that's a pentyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, but that would be a four-carbon substituent. Wait, but that's a secondary butyl group.

So, substituent: -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, that's five carbons, which is a pentyl group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about the NMR again.

The substituent has a CH at 2.9 ppm, a CH2 at 1.7, a CH3 at 1.4, and a CH2CH3 at 0.9.

So, the substituent is a four-carbon chain with a branch. The structure would be: benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3. No, that's five carbons. Wait, no. Maybe it's benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's five carbons, which would be a pentyl group. But the options don't have a pentyl group. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

So, the structure is phenyl group attached to a propanoic acid. Benzene ring with ethyl substituent at para position. So substituents are COOH and ethyl in para positions.

But in the NMR, the substituent besides COOH (ethyl group) would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm (from CH2CH3). But the NMR shows that triplet. So that fits. So, the substituent is ethyl. So, in option A, the substituent is ethyl, para to the COOH.

But then, where does the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) come into play? In option A, the substituent is ethyl, so the only other groups are the COOH and the ethyl. So the NMR would show for the ethyl group a triplet at 0.9 and a quartet around 1.3 ppm (for the CH2 attached to benzene). But in the given NMR, the only peak around 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H.

Wait, but in option A, the substituent is ethyl, so the ethyl group's protons would be split into a quartet and a triplet. But in the given NMR, there's no quartet, just a triplet at 0.9, and a multiplet at 1.7 ppm. So that suggests that the substituent is not ethyl.

Therefore, option A is probably not the correct starting material.

So, that leaves option C as the likely starting material.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, substituent is a sec-butyl group at para position.

So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. Wait, no, that would only be three carbons. Wait, no, the substituent is four carbons, with the point of attachment at the second carbon. So, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's a five-carbon chain, which can't be right. I think I'm getting stuck on the structure of the substituent.

Wait, no, sec-butyl is a four-carbon substituent where the point of attachment is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. But that's three carbons, which would be a propyl group with a branch. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. But that would be a propyl group with a methyl branch. Wait, but that's four carbons, making it a butyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)2 group. So, the structure is benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)2. But that would be a tertiary-butyl group, which doesn't match the NMR data because the NMR shows a CH at 2.9 ppm, which would be adjacent to a CH2 and a CH3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the reaction now since I'm stuck on the structure.

The starting material reacts with red phosphorus and HI. What does that reaction do? Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrohalogenation of alkenes, especially for the anti addition (but I'm not sure about the specifics). Alternatively, in the presence of a carbonyl group, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI are used for the reduction of carbonyl groups. Wait, no, more precisely, red phosphorus is used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. The Clemmensen reduction uses Zn(Hg)/HCl, but sometimes red phosphorus and HI can also be used for similar reductions.

Wait, no, actually, I think that the reduction of esters or ketones with red phosphorus and HI is a different reaction. Wait, perhaps it's the hydrolysis of an ester? No, wait. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI can be used for the deoxygenation of ketones or aldehydes to alkanes. For example, R-CO-R' + HI (with red phosphorus) → R-CH2-R' + HIO.

So, in this case, the starting compound is a benzoic acid (from the IR and NMR data). Wait, but benzoic acid has a carbonyl (COOH). So, if it's a benzoic acid, then reacting it with red phosphorus and HI would do what?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, but the IR and NMR suggest a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps the starting material isn't a benzoic acid, but maybe an ester. Wait, the IR at 1720 could be an ester as well. But the broad peak around 10.5 ppm usually indicates an -OH, which for an ester would be less likely, but possible if it's a saponification. Hmm, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a ketone. But the NMR doesn't show any peaks that would suggest a ketone. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier.

Wait, let's think again. If the starting material is a benzoic acid, then reacting it with red phosphorus and HI might not do anything, because benzoic acid is a strong acid and might not react under those conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis.

Wait, but the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad peak, indicative of an -OH proton. If it's an ester, the -OH would be from any acid formed during the reaction, but that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material isn't a benzoic acid but an aldehyde or ketone. But the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. The peak at 3400–2500 cm-1 is broad, which supports an -OH (like in an aldehyde, but aldehydes have a peak around 2800 cm-1 as well for the C-H stretch. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the starting material is an aryl ester. But that's getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a phenyl acetate or similar. But then, the NMR would show ester protons, which aren't present here.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is not a carboxylic acid but a ketone. Then, the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 would be a ketone carbonyl. The broad peak at 3400–2500 cm-1 might be from an O-H, but if it's a ketone, that's unexpected. Unless the compound has another functional group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a phenol. But a phenol's O-H would be broader and possibly around 5 ppm in NMR, but the given NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more like a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the reaction again. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. If the starting material is a carbonyl-containing compound, like a ketone, then the reaction would reduce it. For example, R-CO-R' → R-CH2-R' plus HIO.

But if the starting material is a benzoic acid, then perhaps the reaction doesn't apply. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, which would be converted into a carboxylic acid under certain conditions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde derivative. But the NMR doesn't show any peaks indicative of an aldehyde proton, which would be around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. The given NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet, suggesting an -OH group. So, in that case, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid.

So, let's go back to the substitution. The substituent on the benzene ring has a CH (2.9), a CH2 (1.7), a CH3 (1.4), and a CH2CH3 (0.9).

This suggests a substituent like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3. Wait, that's five carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 3-methylbutyl group.

Wait, 3-methylbutyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that's five carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So, the substituent would be:

Benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

But that's four carbons. So, the structure would be:

Benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3.

No, that's six carbons. I think I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch.

So, benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. That would be a pentyl group with a branch at the second carbon.

But this is getting too complicated. Let me think about the reaction again. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI.

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the deoxygenation of carbonyl groups, such as in the reduction of ketones to alkanes. So, for example, if the starting material is a ketone, the reaction would reduce the carbonyl group to a methylene group.

So, if the starting material is a ketone, like benzaldehyde, it would be reduced to toluene. But in this case, the starting material is a benzoic acid or an ester.

Wait, but in the case of a carboxylic acid, reacting with HI and red phosphorus doesn't immediately ring a bell for me. Maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester. Let's say the structure is benzene with a COOR group. Then, with red phosphorus and HI, the ester would be reduced to a CH2 group.

Wait, but then the initial NMR would show ester protons, which aren't present. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a nitrile. But that seems unrelated.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde with some substituent, but again, the NMR doesn't show the aldehyde proton.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to think about each option.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

Structure: benzene ring with ethyl group at position 4 and propanoic acid at position 2.

In the NMR, the ethyl group would show triplet around 0.9 ppm, and a quartet around 1.3 ppm. But the given NMR data doesn't show a quartet, just a multiplet at 1.7 ppm. So, the substituent in the starting material may not be ethyl, which suggests option A is not correct.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Structure: benzene ring with COOH at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

Wait, but that can't be because substituents can't be in the same position. So, the substituents would be at the para positions, so COOH at position 1, and sec-butyl at position 4.

In that case, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So, what would that look like in the NMR?

The substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. But I'm not entirely sure about the splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, which is a tert-butyl group. No, that doesn't fit because it would have a different NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, which is a four-carbon group. So, the structure would be:

Benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and substituent at position 4: -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3?

No, that's a five-carbon substituent, which is a pentyl group. That doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)2, which is a tertiary-butyl group. But that wouldn't fit the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, which is a butyl group with a branch. The NMR would show the CH at 2.9, the CH2 at 1.7, and the CH3 at 1.4 (d), and the CH2CH3 at 0.9 (t). That seems to fit.

So, substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's a four-carbon substituent with a branch. So the structure would be:

Benzene ring with COOH at position 4 and substituent at position 4 (sec-butyl), which would be:

Benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and substituent at position 4: -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that seems to fit the NMR.

So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group: -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's a four-carbon substituent with a branch, which would make it a tertiary-butyl group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the substituent's NMR signals.

The substituent's chain shows:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): the CH group attached to the benzene.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): the next CH2 group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal CH2CH3.

So, the substituent is: CH (benzene attached) - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2CH3.

Wait, that's five carbons, which is a pentyl group, but with a branch.

Wait, perhaps it's a 3-methylpentyl group? No, that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Wait, that would be a four-carbon substituent: benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Which is a five-carbon chain, which doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, that's a five-carbon substituent, which doesn't match the options.

Hmm, maybe I should proceed to the reaction.

Assuming the starting material is a benzoic acid with a substituent that has a chain ending in an ethyl group, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the carbonyl group (COOH) to CH2OH or something else. Wait, no, Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones to alkanes. For a carboxylic acid, I'm not sure what would happen.

Wait, perhaps the starting material isn't a benzoic acid but an ester. For example, if the starting material is benzoyl chloride or a phenyl ester. But the NMR doesn't seem to fit that.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a nitrile. But I don't see any indication of that in the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution or elimination. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde derivative, but the NMR doesn't support that.

Hmm. Maybe I should look at the options' structures and see what the products would be after the reaction.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which is typically a deoxygenation reaction for carbonyl groups.

So, the starting material (compound X) must have a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester) that will be reduced.

If the starting material is a ketone, then the product would be an alkane.

If the starting material is a carboxylic acid, I'm not sure what the product would be, but perhaps it's deoxygenated as well.

Wait, another approach: the reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI would not proceed, as carboxylic acids are stable under these conditions.

So, perhaps the starting material is an ester. For example, if X is an ester, then reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the ester to an alkane.

Wait, but the IR data at 1720 cm-1 could also correspond to an ester. So, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the reaction reduces it to an alkane.

Let me consider that. If the starting material is an ester, say, benzene ring with an ester group (like benzyl acetate), then the reaction would reduce the ester group to a CH2 group.

But looking at the options, the products are either benzoic acids or substituted benzene rings.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, a substituted benzene with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group.

If the starting material was an ester, say, benzoyl acetate, but that seems unrelated.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde derivative. For example, if the starting material is benzaldehyde with a substituent, then the reaction would reduce the aldehyde to a CH2 group.

But the NMR doesn't show an aldehyde proton.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option's structure and see what the product would be after reaction with red phosphorus and HI.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Structure: benzene with ethyl at position 4 and propanoic acid at position 2. If this were a ketone (like propanophenone), then the reaction would reduce the ketone to CH2. But it's a carboxylic acid, which I'm not sure about.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Structure: benzene with COOH at position 1 and sec-butyl at position 4. If it's a carboxylic acid, reaction with red phosphorus and HI might not do anything. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nitrile, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Structure: benzene with sec-butyl at position 1 and methyl at position 4. But this is a substituted benzene without any functional groups. So, the starting material for this would not have a carbonyl group, which contradicts the IR and NMR data.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. Similarly, this is a substituted benzene without a functional group, so the starting material wouldn't match.

Hmm, perhaps the starting material is an ester. Let me think. If the starting material is an ester with a carbonyl group, then the reaction would reduce it.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzyl ester, like phenyl acetate. The reaction would reduce the ester to an ethyl group.

But looking at the options, option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, which is a substituted benzene without any functional groups. So, perhaps the starting material is an aromatic ester which is reduced to a substituted benzene.

But the IR data shows a carbonyl peak, which the product in option B doesn't have, so that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzophenone derivative. If it's a benzophenone, the reaction would reduce the ketone to CH2.

But I'm not sure. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another thought: the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is used to reduce nitriles to amines. No, that's not right. Alternatively, it's used for the conversion of alcohols to alkanes, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde derivative. For example, if the starting material is benzaldehyde with a substituent, the reaction would reduce it to toluene. But again, the NMR doesn't show an aldehyde proton.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzyl chloride, but that doesn't fit the spectroscopic data.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzoic acid with an adjacent substituent that can be reduced. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a phenylacetone, which would have a ketone group. Then, the reaction would reduce the ketone to a methylene group. So, if the starting material is phenylacetone (acetophenone), the product would be CH2CH2Ph.

But looking at the options, none of them match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more complex.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group, like a benzophenone, and the reaction reduces the carbonyl to a methylene group.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the benzene ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a nitro compound, but the IR doesn't show the nitro peak (~1520 cm-1). But the IR in the question has 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which could be aromatic C=C, but not nitro.

Hmm.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to summarize.

The starting material has a carboxylic acid group (from IR and NMR) and a substituent on the benzene ring which is a chain ending in an ethyl group. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI likely reduces the carbonyl group.

But if the starting material is a carboxylic acid, the reaction doesn't make sense. So perhaps the starting material is an ester.

If the starting material is an ester, like RCOOR', then reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the ester to RCH2OR'. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester. If X is an ester, then reaction with water (from HI) would hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid. But the given data already suggest a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. But then, the product would be the same as the starting material, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group. But the IR doesn't show a peak for a C=C stretch around 1640 cm-1, which would be expected for a vinyl group. The IR given has 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are more indicative of aromatic C=C.

So, perhaps the substituent isn't a vinyl group.

Another angle: the substituent's NMR shows a CH group at 2.9 ppm, a CH2 at 1.7, a CH3 at 1.4 (d), and a CH2CH3 at 0.9 (t). This suggests a chain like:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3.

Wait, that's a four-carbon branch. So, the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch at the second carbon. So, the substituent is a 3-methylbutyl group.

So, the substituent would be attached to the benzene as -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3.

But that's a five-carbon chain, which isn't matching the options.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So, substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a four-carbon group: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, that's five carbons.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with what I have.

Assuming that the starting material is a benzoic acid with a substituent that is a sec-butyl group, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the carbonyl group.

Wait, but benzoic acid's carbonyl is a COOH group. Reducing that would convert it into a CH2OH group, but under what conditions?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the benzene ring's substituent. For example, if the substituent is a nitro group, the reaction would reduce it to an amino group. But I don't see any nitro peaks in the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent has a double bond which is being hydrogenated. But the IR shows aromatic C=C, which are usually around 1600 cm-1, but the IR given has peaks at 1610 and 1450, which are typical for aromatic rings.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. If the starting material has a good leaving group, such as a tosyl group, then HI would substitute it. But I don't see any indication of that in the spectroscopic data.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck, but I'll try to make an educated guess. Based on the NMR, the substituent seems to be a sec-butyl group. So, the starting material is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the carbonyl group (COOH) to CH2. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl group with CH2.

Wait, but how?

Wait, the Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones to alkanes. For a carboxylic acid, perhaps it would reduce it to a CH2 group as well. So, the COOH group becomes CH3.

Wait, no. Clemmensen reduction converts R-CO-R' → R-CH2-R' + HIO.

So, if the starting material is a carboxylic acid (R-COOH), the reaction would not proceed because there's no adjacent R' group. So, perhaps the starting material isn't a carboxylic acid.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a nitrile. For example, if it's benzene with a nitrile group and a substituent, the reaction would reduce the nitrile to an amine. But that's not relevant to the given options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not a reduction but a substitution. For example, in an aromatic substitution, but I don't have enough data.

Hmm.

Alternatively, think about the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI are used to deoxygenate alcohols. Wait, no, they're used for deoxygenation of carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the starting material isn't a benzoic acid but a ketone. Then, the reaction would reduce the ketone to CH2.

If the starting material is a para-substituted acetophenone, the reaction would reduce it to para-dimethylbenzene.

But looking at the options, option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, which is a substituted benzene with isobutyl and methyl groups.

Alternatively, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

But wait, how would that fit?

If the starting material is an acetophenone derivative, like 4-(substituent)acetophenone, the reaction would reduce the ketone to CH2.

So, after reduction, the product would be 4-(substituent)toluene.

But without knowing the substituent, it's hard to say.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent and the information I have, I think the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Because the NMR and IR data suggest a benzoic acid with a substituent that has a chain ending in ethyl.

After reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the COOH group would be reduced. But I'm not exactly sure how. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the substituent and only the COOH group is converted.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material is an acid chloride. But the NMR doesn't indicate that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by something else. But I'm not sure.

In any case, given the options and the data, I think option C is the starting material. Then, the reaction would reduce the COOH group to CH2, resulting in 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a CH2 group. But looking at the options, none of them match that.

Hmm. Maybe I should reevaluate. Perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the reaction reduces it to a substituted benzene.

Wait, but the options don't have any esters. So, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the substituent but converts the COOH group into something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution, but I don't see how that would apply.

Hmm.

After considering all possibilities, I think the correct answer is option C, and the reaction reduces the carbonyl group to a methylene group, giving 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a CH2 group. But since none of the options match, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the substituent, and the product is the same as the starting material. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group, and the reaction reduces it. But I don't see how.

Hmm. I'm stuck, but I'll go with option C as the starting material and the reaction reduces the carbonyl group. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a CH2 group where the COOH was. But looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a toluene derivative. So, perhaps the product is that.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the product is option D.

But I'm not sure. I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is option C, and the product is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product of a reaction where Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the spectroscopic data provided for Compound X.

### IR Analysis:
- The broad IR peak in the range **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** indicates a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid.
- Peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are indicative of aromatic C=C bonds.

### ¹H NMR Analysis:
- The **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)** peak corresponds to the -OH proton of a carboxylic acid.
- The **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.2 ppm (d, 2H)** peaks suggest a **para-substituted benzene ring**.
- The **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)** peak corresponds to a CH group.
- The **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)** peak corresponds to a CH₂ group.
- The **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)** peak corresponds to a CH₃ group attached to a CH.
- The **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** peak corresponds to a terminal CH₂CH₃ group.

### Structural Interpretation:
The spectroscopic data suggest that Compound X is a **benzoic acid derivative** with a para-substituted benzene ring. The substituent on the benzene ring is identified as a **sec-butyl group** based on the NMR signals:
- The **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)** peak corresponds to the CH group adjacent to the benzene.
- The **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)** peak corresponds to the CH₂ group.
- The **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)** peak corresponds to the CH₃ group attached to the CH.
- The **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** peak corresponds to the terminal CH₂CH₃ group.

Thus, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the **Clemmensen reduction**, which reduces carbonyl groups (e.g., ketones, aldehydes, or esters) to alkanes. However, in the case of a carboxylic acid, the reaction is less straightforward. The carbonyl group of the carboxylic acid is reduced, likely converting the -COOH group into a -CH₂ group. The substituent on the benzene ring remains unaffected.

### Final Product:
After the reaction, the product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzene** with a -CH₂ group where the -COOH group was originally located. Among the given options, this corresponds to **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.
