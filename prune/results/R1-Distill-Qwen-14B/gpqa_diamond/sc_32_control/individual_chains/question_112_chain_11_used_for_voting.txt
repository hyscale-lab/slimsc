Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the problem is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. Let me read it again.

Alright, the state is |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. So I probably need to normalize this state first. Oh wait, the question says it's proportional, so I should find the normalization factor.

The operator given has a matrix where Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. So in matrix form, for a two-level system, it would be:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
      [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, because for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are 0, and the off-diagonal (i≠j) are hbar/2. So the matrix is like:

A = [[0,  hbar/2],
     [hbar/2, 0]]

Wait, that's the operator when i and j are different. Oh, wait, the operator is given as elements Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else zero. So yes, that's correct.

The question asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. Also, find the average value of the operator.

So first, I need to find the eigenstates of the operator A.

Wait, but the operator is given in the computational basis (up and down states), so it's a 2x2 matrix. The eigenstates will be the eigenvectors of this matrix.

Let me find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.

The matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(A - λ I) = 0.

So the determinant is (0-λ)^2 - (ħ/2)^2 = λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0.

So λ² = ħ²/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2. Now, the corresponding eigenvectors.

For λ = ħ/2:

(A - λ I) v = 0 → [[-ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -ħ/2]] v = 0.

The equations are:

(-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of [1,1]^T. But we need to normalize it. The normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1,1]^T.

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2:

(A + λ I) v = 0 → [[ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, ħ/2]] v =0.

Equation: (ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → v1 = -v2.

So eigenvector is [1, -1]^T, normalized to 1/sqrt(2).

So the eigenstates are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, no, because the first eigenvector is [1,1]^T scaled, which would be (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and the other is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the operator A has eigenstates |+> and |-> as above.

Now, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I need to normalize |alpha>.

Compute the norm squared: |1+i|² + |2-i|² = (1² +1²) + (2² + (-1)^2 ) = (2) + (4 +1) = 2 +5=7.

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>. 

Now, to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of A, which are |+> and |->.

The probability of getting eigenvalue ħ/2 is |<+ | alpha>|^2, and similarly for eigenvalue -ħ/2, it's |< - | alpha > |^2.

Let me compute <+| alpha >.

 <+| is (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| )

So <+| alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) *1 ]

= [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) )

Simplify numerator: 1 +i +2 -i = 3.

So <+|alpha> = 3/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) ) = 3 / sqrt(14).

The probability is the square of the magnitude: |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, compute <+|alpha>^2 → 9/14 ≈ 0.64.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, the state |+> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So <+|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Which is ( (1+i +2 -i) ) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) ) = (3) / (sqrt(14)).

So the amplitude is 3/sqrt(14). The probability is (3/sqrt(14))²=9/14≈0.642857.

Then the probability for the other eigenstate |-> is |<- |alpha>|^2.

Compute <-|alpha>:

 <-| is (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| - <down| )

So, <-|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) *1 - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) *1 ]

= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

Simplify numerator: 1 +i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

So <-|alpha> = (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14).

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1+4)/14 =5/14≈0.357.

Wait, that gives probability 5/14≈0.357.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, and 5/14 is approximately 0.3571. So the total is 14/14=1, which is good.

But looking at the options, the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36 in option A. Hmm, 9/14 is approximately 0.6428 (0.64) and 5/14 is approx 0.357, which doesn't exactly match any option. Let me see the options again.

Options:

A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7

Wait, 0.64 is roughly 9/14≈0.6428. 0.36 is 36/100=9/25=0.36. 5/14 is about 0.357, which is close to 0.36. So perhaps the question rounds to two decimal places.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7).

So <+| alpha> is [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / sqrt(2 *7) = (3)/sqrt(14).

So magnitude squared is 9/14 ≈0.6428.

And for |->, the inner product is [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14) = ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14).

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.357. So that's 5/14≈0.357, which is approximately 0.36. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So the first part would be 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, the average value of the operator A. The average is given by <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2 and the state |alpha> can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenstates, the expectation value is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their respective probabilities.

So <A> = (ħ/2)(9/14) + ( - ħ/2)(5/14) ) = [ (9 -5) * ħ/2 ] /14 = (4 ħ/2 ) /14 = (2 ħ) /14 = ħ /7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36 and ħ/7. So that matches.

Wait, but let's cross-check the average value calculation another way just to be sure.

Another way: Compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

The operator A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. So in matrix form, it's:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0   ]

The state |alpha> is represented as a column vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So <alpha| A |alpha> is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A multiplied by |alpha>.

Let me compute this.

Let me denote |alpha> as a vector [a; b], where a=(1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Then, A |alpha> is [ 0*a + (ħ/2)*b; (ħ/2)*a + 0*b ] = [ (ħ/2) b; (ħ/2) a ].

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is [a*, b*] * [ (ħ/2) b; (ħ/2) a ].

So,

= a* (ħ/2) b + b* (ħ/2) a.

Factor out (ħ/2):

= (ħ/2) [ a* b + b* a ].

But a* b + b* a = 2 Re(a* b).

So,

= (ħ/2) * 2 Re(a* b ) = ħ Re(a* b).

Compute a* b:

a* = (1-i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

a* b = (1 -i)(2 -i) /7.

Multiply numerator: (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i².

i² is -1. So 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

So a* b = (1 -3i)/7.

The real part is 1/7.

So Re(a* b)= 1/7.

So <A> = ħ * (1/7) = ħ/7.

So that's correct. So the average is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7. So option A.

To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The norm squared is calculated as:

\[
|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalization factor is \( 1/\sqrt{7} \), and the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \hbar/2 \\
\hbar/2 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \pm \hbar/2 \), and the corresponding normalized eigenstates are:

\[
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \), we compute the inner products \( \langle +|\alpha\rangle \) and \( \langle -|\alpha\rangle \). Using \( \langle +| = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\langle \uparrow| + \langle \downarrow|) \), we calculate:

\[
\langle +|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( |+\rangle \) is:

\[
P(|+\rangle) = \left| \langle +|\alpha\rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
\]

Similarly, using \( \langle -| = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\langle \uparrow| - \langle \downarrow|) \), we compute:

\[
\langle -|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( |-\rangle \) is:

\[
P(|-\rangle) = \left| \langle -|\alpha\rangle \right|^2 = \frac{(-1)^2 + 2^2}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha| A |\alpha\rangle.
\]

Using \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \hbar/2 \\ \hbar/2 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \) and \( |\alpha\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \\ \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \end{bmatrix} \), we find:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \text{Re} \left( \frac{(1-i)(2-i)}{7} \right) \right).
\]

The real part of \( \frac{(1-i)(2-i)}{7} \) is \( \frac{1}{7} \), so:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \hbar/7 \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
