Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the rotation-vibration model. The question is about a molecule in its fundamental state and what photon momentum is needed to switch it to the next lowest energy state. 

First, I need to figure out what the fundamental state means. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state of the molecule, which would correspond to the ground state in both rotation and vibration. So, the molecule is in its lowest energy state for both vibrations and rotations.

Wait, but the problem is about moving to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, I think that means the next higher energy state, which would probably be the first excited state. Since the molecule is in the fundamental state, the photon must provide the energy difference needed to move to the next state. 

But wait, what kind of transition is this? In the rotation-vibration model, the molecule can change both rotational and vibrational states when a photon is absorbed. So, the energy levels are a combination of both rotational and vibrational energies. 

The next lowest energy state after the fundamental would be the first excited state. But I'm a bit confused about whether this transition affects the rotation, vibration, or both. Let me think. The fundamental state is the lowest energy, so the next state could involve either an increase in the vibrational quantum number, the rotational quantum number, or a combination of both. But the "lowest possible energy" next state would likely be the one with the smallest increase in energy.

In quantum mechanics, the vibrational energy levels are quantized and given by E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant and J is the rotational quantum number.

Since the fundamental state is the lowest, v=0 and J=0 (or the lowest J possible, which is J=0). To go to the next lowest energy, the molecule would probably increase either v or J. But which requires less energy? The vibrational energy spacing is much larger than the rotational spacing. Because B is usually much smaller than ½ ħω. So, the first transition would likely be a rotational one, not a vibrational one. 

Wait, but wait. The possible transitions might depend on whether the photon's energy is sufficient to cause a change in rotation, vibration, or both. But in the problem, the photon is absorbed, moving the molecule to the next state with the lowest energy. So the energy needed is the minimal possible energy difference between the fundamental state and the next higher state.

Wait, but the problem says the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which suggests that both rotational and vibrational energies contribute. So the total energy is E = E_vib + E_rot.

In the fundamental state, v=0, and J=0. The next state could be either v=1, J=0; or v=0, J=1; or v=1, J=1. But which of these has the lowest energy? Because the energy from vibrational and rotational are additive.

Since the vibrational energy when v=1 is (1 + ½) ħω = 3/2 ħω, and the rotational energy for J=1 is B(1)(2) = 2B. So the next state could be either adding a vibrational level, which is higher, or adding a rotational level, which is lower. So between the two, the one with the lower energy is the rotational transition. Because 2B is probably smaller than 3/2 ħω.

Wait, but we don't know the actual values of B and ħω. Maybe I can calculate B.

Wait, the problem gives us some data. Let me check the given values again:

Mx = 20 amu, My=2 amu. So the reduced mass μ would be (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20*2)/(22) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Oh wait, but I need to convert that into kg because the Planck constant is in SI units.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ about 3.014e-27 kg. Wait, let me calculate it properly.

Wait, Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu, so total mass is 22 amu. So μ = 20 * 2 / (20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu. So 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg is:

1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 = let's compute 1.81818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.012e0 (since 1.818 *1.66 is about 3). So μ ≈ 3.012e-27 kg.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

The rotational constant B is given by ħ² / (2 I μ), where I is the moment of inertia, which is μ R². So let me compute B.

Wait, the formula for rotational constant B is (h²)/(8 π² I μ), but I might be mixing up the formulas. Let me get it right.

The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = (ħ²)/(2 I), and I is the moment of inertia I = μ R². So B = ħ²/(2 μ R²).

Wait, let me make sure I have the right formula.

I think the rotational constant B is given by B = (h²)/(8 π² I), but sometimes it's expressed in terms of ħ. Oh, wait, ħ is h/(2π), so:

B = (h²)/(8 π² I) = ( (2π ħ)^2 )/(8 π² I ) = (4 π² ħ²) / (8 π² I ) ) = ( ħ² )/(2 I )

So yes, B = ħ²/(2 I), and I = μ R², so B = ħ²/(2 μ R² )

Let me compute B.

Compute I = μ R² = (3.012e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.012e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2048e-46 kg m².

Then B = ħ²/(2 I) = ( (1.0545718e-34 J s)^2 ) / (2 * 1.2048e-46 kg m² )

Compute numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

Denominator: 2 * 1.2048e-46 = 2.4096e-46 kg m².

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.4096e-46 ≈ 4.613e-23 J.

But wait, that's the value in Joules. Let me convert this into cm^-1, because sometimes rotational constants are expressed in wavenumbers. But perhaps I should compute the energy spacing for rotation.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to calculate the energy difference between J=0 and J=1, which is the rotational transition.

The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1). So for J=0, E=0. For J=1, E= B * 2. So the energy difference ΔE_rot = 2B - 0 = 2B.

Similarly, the vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω. So from v=0 to v=1, the energy difference is (3/2 ħω - 1/2 ħω )= ħ ω.

So the question is whether 2B is smaller than ħω. Because if so, then the next state would involve a rotational transition, not a vibrational one.

Given that the problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state, the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one where the energy difference is the smallest.

So first, I need to compute 2B and compare it with ħω.

Given that ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s, and ω is 4e14 rad/s, ħω is approx 4.218e-20 J.

Wait, let's compute 2B:

Earlier, I found B ≈4.613e-23 J. So 2B is approx 9.226e-23 J.

Wait, 9.226e-23 J is about 9.226e-23 J. Now, compare that to ħω, which is 1.0545718e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

Wait, 9.226e-23 is about 0.009226e-19, which is way smaller than 4.218e-20.

Wait, no: 9.226e-23 is 9.226e-23 J, which is 0.0009226e-19 J. While 4.218e-20 is 0.04218e-18 J. So 9.226e-23 J is 9.226e-23 / 4.218e-20 = approx 2.186e-3 times smaller than ħω. So 2B is much smaller than ħω. Therefore, the energy needed for a rotational transition is much less than for a vibrational transition.

So the next higher state would be the rotational transition, because it requires less energy. Therefore, the photon must supply energy equal to ΔE = 2B.

But wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Because the photon's energy is related to its frequency, and the momentum is related to that as well.

I remember that the momentum p of a photon is given by p = E/c, where E is the photon's energy and c is the speed of light.

So the photon's energy should be equal to the energy difference ΔE needed for the transition. So E_photon = 2B.

So p_photon = E_photon / c = (2B) / c.

So let's compute 2B, then divide by c to get p.

Wait, earlier I computed B as approximately 4.613e-23 J. So 2B is 9.226e-23 J.

The speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.226e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.075e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are that small. The options are in the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculating B. Let me double-check.

Wait, the moment of inertia I is μ R².

μ is the reduced mass of the two atoms. So Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) ) * amu.

Which is 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert that to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

1.818 * 1.6605 is approx 3.016, so μ ≈3.016e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m.

So I = μ R² = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

B is ħ²/(2I) = ( (1.05457e-34 J s)^2 ) / ( 2 * 1.2064e-46 kg m² )

Calculate numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

Denominator: 2 * 1.2064e-46 = 2.4128e-46 kg m².

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.4128e-46 = approx 4.608e-23 J.

Wait, so 2B is 9.216e-23 J.

Hmm, so 9.216e-23 J divided by 3e8 m/s gives p=3.072e-31 kg m/s. But the options are all about 1e-27 to 1e-28 kg m/s. So my answer is way off. That suggests I must have made a mistake.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the formula for B. Let me think again.

Wait, the rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), and B is given by (h²)/(8 π² I). Let me compute B using that formula instead.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s.

So B = h²/(8 π² I).

Compute h squared: (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

Denominator: 8 * pi² * I = 8 * (9.8696) * I.

I is 1.2064e-46 kg m².

So denominator is 8 * 9.8696 * 1.2064e-46.

8 * 9.8696 is about 78.9568. 78.9568 *1.2064e-46 = approx 95.2e-46 =9.52e-45.

So B=4.39e-67 / 9.52e-45 = approx 4.61e-23 J. Same result as before. So my previous calculation was correct.

So why are the options so much bigger than my calculated p?

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering that the molecule can have both rotational and vibrational transitions, but the problem says the next state with the lowest possible energy. Maybe the next state is not just a pure rotational or pure vibrational transition, but a combination.

Wait, no. The next state with the lowest energy after the fundamental state would be the one with the smallest possible energy increment. So if the energy for a rotational transition (ΔE_rot=2B) is lower than the energy for a vibrational transition (ΔE_vib= ħω), then the molecule would undergo a rotational transition.

But in my earlier calculation, 2B was 9.2e-23 J and ħω was 4.2e-20 J. So 9.2e-23 is much smaller than 4.2e-20. So the rotational transition requires less energy.

But according to this, the photon's energy should be about 9.2e-23 J. So the photon's momentum p is E/c, which is 9.2e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in terms of wavenumbers, or perhaps I'm missing a factor. Wait, am I using the correct formula for B?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference isn't 2B.

Wait, E_rot for J=0 is 0, and for J=1 is B*(1)(2)=2B. So the energy difference is 2B.

Hmm, but maybe the molecule can't transition directly from J=0, v=0 to J=1, v=0 because of selection rules. Are there selection rules for rotational transitions? Oh right, in rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ=±1, but for diatomic molecules in vibrational transitions, the rotational state can change by ±1. But I'm not sure about the details.

Wait, but the problem is about the molecule being in the fundamental state, so v=0, J=0. To go to the next state with the lowest energy, perhaps it's a vibrational transition because B is so small that 2B is way smaller than the vibrational energy difference. But earlier calculation shows that 2B is much smaller than ħω.

Wait, 2B is approx 9.2e-23 J, and ħω is 4.2e-20 J. So 9.2e-23 is much smaller than 4.2e-20. So the next state would be a rotational transition.

But the options don't have anything near 3e-31 kg m/s. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I confused the formula and should have used E_photon = ħω instead. Because the problem gives ω, which is the angular frequency for vibration.

Wait, the question is about the photon's momentum. The photon's energy is E_photon = ħω, so its momentum is p = E_photon /c = ħω /c.

But wait, that would be for a vibrational transition. But earlier thought says that the rotational transition requires less energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which suggests that it's a non-rigid rotor. But in that case, the vibrational and rotational energies are both considered. So the next state would require the smallest possible energy increase, which could be a combination of both.

Wait, but the fundamental state is the lowest for both, so the next state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But the rotational transition requires less energy, so it's more likely to be the first.

But my calculation for the photon's momentum is way off compared to the options. So perhaps I did a mistake.

Wait, let me try to compute p using the given parameters again.

Another approach: perhaps the molecule undergoes a transition that involves both a rotational and vibrational change. But I think that's more complicated and the question is probably about either a pure rotational or pure vibrational transition.

But perhaps I should calculate the photon's energy required for a vibrational transition.

In that case, ΔE_vib = ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

Then, the momentum p = E/c = 4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s.

Wait, that's about 1.4e-28 kg m/s, which is option D: 1.4e-28 N s.

Wait, 1 N s is 1 kg m/s. So yes, 1.4e-28 N s is the same as 1.4e-28 kg m/s.

So if the photon's energy is ħω, the momentum is 1.4e-28 kg m/s, which matches option D.

But earlier, I thought that the rotational transition requires less energy. But according to my calculation, the rotational transition's energy is 9.2e-23 J, which is way higher than 4.2e-20 J.

Wait, wait, no. 9.2e-23 J is actually smaller than 4.2e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So why would the photon's energy be 4.2e-20 J?

Ah, this is confusing. Let me think again: 9.2e-23 is 9.2 *1e-23; 4.2e-20 is 420 *1e-22. So 9.2e-23 is about 0.219% of 4.2e-20. So 9.2e-23 is much smaller than 4.2e-20.

So if the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next state with the lowest energy would be the one requiring the least energy. So that's J=1, v=0, which requires 2B.

But that would lead to a photon momentum of 3e-31 kg m/s, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps the question is about a vibrational transition, not a rotational one, despite the lower energy required.

Wait, perhaps the model is such that the molecule is treated as a rotor, and the energy levels are only considering rotation, not vibration. No, the question says it's modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which includes both.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the fundamental vibrational state. Like, the molecule is in the ground vibrational state, but perhaps the rotational state is in the first excited state. Wait, but the fundamental state is the ground state for both.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next vibrational state, not the next overall state. But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the smallest ΔE.

Wait, maybe I should compute both and see which matches the options.

For the rotational transition, p = 3e-31 kg m/s. But that's not an option.

For the vibrational transition, p=1.4e-28 kg m/s, which is option D.

But why would the molecule transition to a higher vibrational state when a rotational transition requires less energy? That doesn't make sense, unless I'm missing something.

Wait a minute, perhaps I confused the rotational and vibrational energy constants. Let me think again.

The rotational constant B is in Joules, and the vibrational energy levels are in Joules as well.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the energy differences in terms of wavenumbers or some other unit. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating B.

Wait, maybe I should compute B in terms of 1/cm, which is a common unit for vibrational transitions.

But I'm not sure. Let me try another approach. Let me compute the energy difference for rotation and for vibration, and see which one is smaller.

ΔE_rot = 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

ΔE_vib = ħω = 4.2e-20 J.

So ΔE_rot is smaller. So the molecule would require a photon of energy 9.2e-23 J to transition to J=1, v=0.

But that gives a momentum of 3e-31 kg m/s, which is not an option.

So perhaps the model is such that the molecule can't undergo a pure rotational transition in the ground vibrational state, or perhaps the problem is considering only the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the next state in terms of energy, but the next state in terms of quantum numbers. But that doesn't make sense, because the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one with the smallest energy difference.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the molecule's transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next higher vibrational state (v=1, J=0), ignoring the rotational transitions because the selection rules don't allow it. But I thought that for diatomic molecules, ΔJ=±1 is allowed in rotational transitions, but for vibrational transitions, Δv=±1. So the molecule can change both at the same time.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor, which only allows rotational transitions, but the question says it's a rotation-vibration model, which is the non-rigid rotor, which allows for both.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think of the photon's momentum. The given options are:

A) 1.9e-28 kg m/s

B) 2.3e-27 kg m/s

C) 1.1e-27 kg m/s

D) 1.4e-28 kg m/s

Which is approximately all around 1e-28 to 1e-27 kg m/s.

So, if the photon's energy is ħω, which is 4.2e-20 J, then p=4.2e-20 /3e8 = 1.4e-28 kg m/s, which is option D. So if the photon causes a vibrational transition, the momentum is about 1.4e-28 kg m/s.

But why would the next state be a vibrational one when a rotational transition requires less energy?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of B. Let me try to compute B again.

Wait, I = μ R².

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) in kg.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So μ = (40)/(22) amu = 20/11 amu ≈1.818 amu.

1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ ≈1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg = let me compute that:

1.818 *1.6605 = approx 3.016. So μ ≈3.016e-27 kg.

R is 2 Angstroms = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ R² =3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Then B = ħ²/(2 I).

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So B = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 *1.2064e-46) 

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 (approx).

Denominator: 2.4128e-46.

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.4128e-46 = approx 4.608e-23 J.

So 2B =9.216e-23 J.

This is correct.

So the photon's momentum would be 9.216e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.072e-31 kg m/s.

No option matches this. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the transition to the next vibrational state, not the rotational one. So the energy change is ħω, which gives p=1.4e-28 kg m/s, which is option D.

So why would the molecule go to a higher vibrational state when a rotational transition requires less energy? Perhaps the question is considering only vibrational transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the molecule is in the ground vibrational state but the ground rotational state isn't the lowest possible, but that doesn't make sense because J=0 is the lowest.

Wait, maybe the problem isn't considering the rotational part. Maybe it's a typo and the model is the rigid rotor, but the question says rotation-vibration model.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the photon's energy is the sum of the rotational and vibrational energy differences, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the question is about the transition from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state where both v and J increase by 1. But that would require even more energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the transition to the next higher energy state regardless of whether it's rotational or vibrational, but it's the next state in order, but that doesn't make sense in terms of energy.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the process again.

The problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state (v=0, J=0). We need to find the photon's momentum that causes the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

The possible next states are:

1. v=1, J=0: energy is (1.5 ħω) + 0 = 1.5 ħω.

2. v=0, J=1: energy is 0 + 2B = 2B.

3. v=1, J=1: energy is 1.5 ħω + 2B.

The next state with the lowest energy is whichever has the smallest ΔE. So compute 1.5 ħω and 2B.

Compute 1.5 ħω: 1.5 * 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 1.5 *4.218e-20 = 6.327e-20 J.

2B is 9.2e-23 J, which is much smaller. So the photon's energy should be 2B=9.2e-23 J.

But that gives a momentum of 3e-31 kg m/s, which is not an option.

So perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think about the selection rules. In vibrational transitions, the selection rule is Δv=±1, and for rotational transitions, ΔJ=±1. But in some cases, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can change both its vibrational and rotational state.

But regardless, the energy required for a transition to J=1, v=0 would be lower.

But again, my calculation doesn't match any of the given options, so perhaps I'm making a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the vibrational transition, and the rotational part is irrelevant. But then why is the rotational-vibration model mentioned?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the molecule's transition to the first excited state, which is a combination of vibrational and rotational transitions, but that would require more energy.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of wavenumbers for the vibrational transition, but I don't see how that would change the photon's momentum.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the next state in terms of the quantum numbers, not the energy. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the photon's momentum is determined by the change in angular momentum, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the transition from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=0. So the energy difference is only the vibrational part.

In that case, E_photon = ħω =4.218e-20 J, and p_photon =4.218e-20 /3e8 =1.406e-28 kg m/s, which is option D.

But why would the molecule transition to a vibrational state when a rotational one requires less energy? It doesn't make sense, but perhaps that's what the question is implying.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is misworded, and it's considering only vibrational transitions. But then why include the rotational model?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the transition to the next state in the vibrational model, not considering rotation. But that contradicts the problem statement.

Given that none of the options match the rotational transition, but option D matches the vibrational transition, I'm starting to think that perhaps the intended answer is D.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating B.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate B in terms of cm^-1.

The rotational constant B is often expressed in wavenumbers (cm^-1), which is B̃ = B/(hc). So hc is 12400 cm J.

Wait, no. Let me think: B is in Joules. So B̃ = B / (hc), where hc is approximately 12400 cm·J.

So B̃ = (4.608e-23 J) / (12400 cm·J) ≈ 3.716e-27 cm^-1.

Wait, that can't be right. Because rotational constants in cm^-1 are usually around 1-100 cm^-1 for diatomic molecules. But maybe I did the units wrong.

Wait, hc is approximately 12400 cm·J? Let me compute hc in J·cm.

h is 6.626e-34 J s, c is 3e8 m/s = 3e10 cm/s.

So hc =6.626e-34 *3e10 = 1.9878e-23 J cm.

So B̃ = B/(h c) = 4.608e-23 J / (1.9878e-23 J cm) ≈ 2.323 cm^-1.

So B̃ is about 2.32 cm^-1.

The vibrational wavenumber is ~ (ω/(2π c)).

Wait, the given ω is 4e14 rad/s.

Wavenumber ̃ν = ω/(2π c).

c=3e8 m/s = 3e10 cm/s.

So ̃ν =4e14 / (2π *3e10 ) =4e14/(6e10 π) ≈4e14/(1.885e11) ≈2.12e3 cm^-1.

So the vibrational wavenumber is about 2120 cm^-1, which is much higher than the rotational B̃ of ~2.3 cm^-1.

So the vibrational energy spacing is much larger than the rotational.

So a photon causing a transition would require more energy for a vibrational transition than a rotational one. But in our earlier calculation, the rotational transition's energy is way smaller than the vibrational.

So why is the photon's momentum not matching any option when considering the rotational transition. Maybe the correct answer is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is looking for the photon's momentum corresponding to the vibrational transition, which is option D.

But I'm stuck. I think I'll go with option D as the answer, but I'm not entirely sure.

To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition a diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the system using the rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in the fundamental state, which corresponds to the lowest energy state for both vibrational and rotational modes: \(v = 0\) and \(J = 0\). The next state with the lowest energy will depend on the energy differences associated with transitions in the vibrational and rotational modes.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Vibrational Energy Levels**:  
   The vibrational energy levels are given by \(E_{\text{vib}} = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega\).  
   The energy difference for a transition from \(v = 0\) to \(v = 1\) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar\omega
   \]  
   Substituting \(\hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J s}\) and \(\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\):  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})(4 \times 10^{14}) = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Rotational Energy Levels**:  
   The rotational energy levels are given by \(E_{\text{rot}} = B J (J + 1)\), where \(B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu R^2}\) is the rotational constant.  
   The energy difference for a transition from \(J = 0\) to \(J = 1\) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B
   \]  
   The reduced mass \(\mu\) is calculated as:  
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \, \text{amu} \cdot 2 \, \text{amu}}{22 \, \text{amu}} = 1.818 \, \text{amu}
   \]  
   Converting \(\mu\) to kilograms (\(1 \, \text{amu} = 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\)):  
   \[
   \mu = 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.016 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
   \]  
   The bond length \(R = 2 \, \text{\AA} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\). The moment of inertia is:  
   \[
   I = \mu R^2 = (3.016 \times 10^{-27})(2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2064 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg m}^2
   \]  
   The rotational constant is:  
   \[
   B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \cdot 1.2064 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.608 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   Thus, the rotational energy difference is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \cdot 4.608 \times 10^{-23} = 9.216 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]

3. **Comparison of Energy Differences**:  
   The vibrational energy difference (\(\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}\)) is much larger than the rotational energy difference (\(\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.216 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\)). Therefore, the next state with the lowest energy corresponds to a rotational transition.

4. **Photon Momentum for Rotational Transition**:  
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \(p = \frac{E}{c}\), where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\). For the rotational transition:  
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.216 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.072 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg m/s}
   \]  
   However, this value does not match any of the provided options.

5. **Photon Momentum for Vibrational Transition**:  
   If the transition corresponds to a vibrational change (\(v = 0 \to v = 1\)), the photon momentum is:  
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg m/s}
   \]  
   This matches **option D**.

### Conclusion:
While the rotational transition requires less energy, the calculated momentum for this transition does not align with the provided options. The vibrational transition, though requiring more energy, results in a momentum that matches one of the options. Therefore, the intended answer is likely based on the vibrational transition.
