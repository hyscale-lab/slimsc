Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says: We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, but I'll try to figure it out without peeking.

First, I should probably calculate the initial concentration after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. So the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We're adding 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. 

Wait, so M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. The new volume V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40. Let me compute that. 0.05 *20 is 1. 1 divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base) is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So the reaction is 1:1.

Now, the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid initially. Let's find the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. Moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). The volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So moles = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. 

At equivalence point, we've added 0.001 moles of NaOH. The volume of NaOH needed would be moles / concentration. So 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. But wait, the problem is asking about the pH at 25% titration and equivalence point. So for the equivalence point, the solution will be the sodium acetate solution. 

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate ions. The solution will consist of sodium acetate in water, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So the solution will be basic. The pH can be calculated using the Kb of acetate.

Wait, first, let me think about the equivalence point. So the moles of NaOH are same as moles of acetic acid, so all the acetic acid becomes acetate. The concentration of acetate in the solution?

The total volume at equivalence point is initial volume (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added. Wait, but wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³ (20 +20), and at equivalence, we've added 10 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 50 cm³ (0.05 L). So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 moles / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001. At equivalence, all of it becomes acetate. So the moles of acetate are 0.001. The total volume is 40 cm³ (diluted) plus the volume of NaOH added. Since the NaOH added is 10 cm³, total is 50 cm³. So 0.001 moles in 0.05 L gives 0.02 M acetate.

But wait, I might need to check that again. Let's see: initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³, 0.025 M, so 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. So when you add 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH (which is 0.001 moles), it reacts completely. So the solution after equivalence is 40 +10 = 50 cm³. So acetate is 0.001 moles in 0.05 L, which is 0.02 M. Correct.

Now, for the equivalence point pH: since acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, it will hydrolyze in water. The reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. To find Kb, we can use Kw/Ka. Ka for acetic acid is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. The hydrolysis reaction's equilibrium expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]. Let me set up an ICE table.

Initial concentrations:
[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M
[CH3COOH] = 0
[OH^-] = 0

Change:
CH3COO^- decreases by x, CH3COOH increases by x, OH- increases by x.

Equilibrium:
[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x
[CH3COOH] = x
[OH^-] = x

So Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x^2 /0.02, since x will be very small.

So x^2 = Kb * 0.02 ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

Taking square root, x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.287e-6 M.

So [OH^-] = 3.287e-6 → pOH = -log(3.287e-6) ≈ 5.486. So pH = 14 -5.486 ≈ 8.514. So approximately 8.51. Looking at the options, choice A has 8.52, D has 6.92, etc. So maybe 8.52 is the equivalence point pH.

But wait, the options also have equivalence points like 6.73, 7.00, etc. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait another thought: perhaps at the equivalence point, the solution isn't just the acetate, but I have to consider any possible activity coefficients or other factors. Or maybe I miscalculated the Kb. Let me check the Kb again.

Ka = 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, but wait, when I calculated x^2, I took it as 5.405e-10 * 0.02. Let me compute that again. 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. Square root is about 3.287e-6. So OH- is about 3.287e-6, which gives pOH about 5.486, so pH=8.514. So about 8.51. So the equivalence point pH is around 8.51.

Looking at the options, option A says 8.52 and 4.26. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm. So maybe the equivalence point is 8.52 (option A's second value is 8.52), but wait, the question is about the pH at 25% titration and equivalence.

Wait, I need to find both the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So I should first compute the pH at 25% titration.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.

So moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 moles.

25% of that is 0.00025 moles. So moles of NaOH added is 0.00025 moles.

Reaction: each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid, producing a mole of acetate.

So after adding 0.00025 moles NaOH, the moles of acetic acid will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. The moles of acetate will be 0.00025 moles.

The total volume at this point is the initial volume (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added. The volume of NaOH added is (0.00025 moles) / (0.1 M) ) = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³. So total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So concentrations:

[Acetic acid] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[Acetate] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, because we have a buffer solution (mix of weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is given by -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. 1.85e-5 is approximately 1.85 x 10^-5. The log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let's compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is approximately -0.4771.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.4771 ≈ 4.256. So approximately 4.26.

Looking at the options, option A gives 4.26 and 8.52, which matches both the titration at 25% and the equivalence point.

But wait, I think I made a mistake in the equivalence point. Because when I calculated the acetate concentration, I considered the total volume as 50 cm³, but let me recheck.

Wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³, and at equivalence, we've added 10 cm³ of NaOH (because 0.001 moles / 0.1 M NaOH is 0.01 L = 10 cm³). So the total volume is 50 cm³, correct.

So the acetate concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Wait, but wait another thing: when a weak acid is titrated with strong base, the equivalence point is a solution of the conjugate base. So the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.

Earlier, I calculated pH ≈8.51, which is around 8.52, which matches option A.

So the two pH values would be about 4.26 and 8.52, which is option A.

But wait, let's check another option. Option D has 4.57 and 6.92, which doesn't seem to fit. Option B is 3.17 and 6.73, which doesn't align. So option A seems correct.

Wait, but wait another thought: maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the 25% titration's pH. Let me recalculate the Henderson-Hasselbalch part.

So [A^-] is 0.00025 mol in 0.0425 L → 0.005882 M.

[HA] is 0.00075 mol in 0.0425 L → 0.017647 M.

Their ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333.

So log(0.3333) is log(1/3), which is approximately -0.477. So pH = 4.733 -0.477 =4.256, which is about 4.26. So that's correct.

So the pH at 25% is about 4.26 and at equivalence is 8.52, which is option A.

To solve the problem, we start by calculating the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and it is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the new concentration is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1 \cdot V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we determine the pH at 25% titration. At this point, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of acetic acid initially are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.025 \cdot 0.04 = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

At 25% titration, 0.25% of the moles of acetic acid have reacted with NaOH. The moles of acetic acid remaining are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The moles of acetate formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is the initial volume (40.00 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added. The volume of NaOH added is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.00025}{0.1} = 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

Thus, the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 + 2.5 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate are:

\[
[\text{Acetic acid}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{Acetate}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{Acetate}]}{[\text{Acetic acid}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.3333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately \( 4.26 \).

Next, we calculate the pH at the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate, forming a solution of sodium acetate. The moles of acetate are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is the initial volume (40.00 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added. The volume of NaOH added is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 10.0 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

Thus, the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 + 10.0 = 50.0 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{Acetate}] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \). Using the approximation \( K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{[\text{Acetate}]} \), where \( x = [\text{OH}^-] \):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{Acetate}] = 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.287 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.287 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.486.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.486 = 8.514 \approx 8.52.
\]

Thus, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately \( 8.52 \).

The pH values at 25% titration and equivalence point are \( 4.26 \) and \( 8.52 \), respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:
