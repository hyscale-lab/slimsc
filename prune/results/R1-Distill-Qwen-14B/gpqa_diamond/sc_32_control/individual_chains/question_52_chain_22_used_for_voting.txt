Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics. When the star doesn't have dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the change in the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels when the star has spots versus when it doesn't.

Hmm. I remember that in stars, the distribution of atoms between different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). So the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels depends on the temperature. The formula I recall is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, and k is Boltzmann's constant.

Wait, but in this problem, the spots cause the overall photospheric temperature to decrease. So I'm guessing that the presence of spots affects the excitation of the Ti atoms. The problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in levels 1 and 2 decreases. So when spots are present, n2/n1 is lower.

Wait, why would the ratio change? Because the temperature is lower, so the exponential term would be smaller. Let me think. The energy difference between the two levels is related to the wavelength given. The transition corresponds to about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet or maybe far UV? Let's see, 1448 Angstroms is 144.8 nm. So that's in the vacuum UV range. The energy of the photon would be E = hc/lambda. But for the energy difference between levels, E2 - E1 = hc/lambda.

But wait, the energy levels are fixed for the atom, so E2 - E1 = hc/lambda. So the wavelength tells us the energy difference between the two levels. So the wavelength is 1448 Å, so in terms of energy, E = hc/(lambda * 1e-10 m) because 1 Å is 1e-10 m. Let me compute that. But maybe I don't need the exact value because it might cancel out later.

The ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So when T is lower, the exponent is more negative, making the ratio smaller. So when the star has spots and T_eff is lower, n2/n1 would be lower.

Wait, the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when there are no spots, the temperature is higher, leading to a higher ratio. Wait, no, wait. The ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). Suppose E2 > E1 (since the transition is from level 1 to 2, I think higher energy level is level 2). So if E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive. So when T is higher, the exponent is less negative, so exp( -(E)/(k T) ) is larger, making n2/n1 larger. So when the star without spots has higher T (6000 K) compared to when it has spots (5500 K), the ratio n2/n1 would be higher. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So that means when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. Therefore, the ratio when no spots is n2/n1 (no spots) = higher, and when spots are present, it's lower. So the ratio (no spots)/(spots) would be greater than 1.

Wait, the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. So the ratio (n2/n1) when no spots is R1, and when spots are present, it's R2. The factor would be R1/R2.

So R1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T1) ), where T1 is 6000 K.

R2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T2) ), T2 is 5500 K.

So R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, let's compute that. Since E2-E1 is positive, and 1/T1 is larger than 1/T2 (since T1 is higher). So (1/T1 - 1/T2) is positive, so the exponent is positive. So the ratio R1/R2 is exp( positive number ), which is greater than 1. So the factor is greater than 1, which makes sense because the ratio is higher when T is higher.

So to find that factor, I need to calculate the exponent. Let's get the numbers right.

First, compute E = hc/lambda.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

lambda is 1448 Angstroms, which is 1.448e-7 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7 )

Let me compute that.

6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

But wait, 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 J. So converting E from J to eV: 1.373e-18 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.58 eV.

So E is about 8.58 eV per photon. But wait, that's for a transition between two energy levels. So the energy difference is E2-E1 = 8.58 eV.

Wait, but wait, the transition is from level 1 to level 2, which would be higher energy. So E2 - E1 = 8.58 eV.

Ok, so now, the exponent in R1/R2 is (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

k is Boltzmann's constant, 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So let's compute (E2-E1)/(k) = 8.58 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.58 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 8.58 / 0.00008617 ≈ around 100,000 or 1e5.

Wait, 8.58 / 8.617e-5 = let me calculate it more accurately.

8.617e-5 is 0.00008617. So 8.58 / 0.00008617 = ?

Well, 8.58 / 0.00008617 ≈ let me compute 8.58 / 8.617e-5.

Which is approximately 8.58 / 8.617e-5 = (8.58 / 8.617 ) * 1e5.

8.58 /8.617 = approx 0.995, so 0.995 * 1e5 = 99500.

So (E2-E1)/(k) ≈ 99500 K.

Now, compute (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (1/6000 - 1/5500) 1/K.

Compute 1/6000 ≈ 0.00016667, 1/5500 ≈ 0.00018182.

Difference is 0.00018182 - 0.00016667 = 0.00001515.

Wait, wait no: 1/6000 = 1.6666667e-4, 1/5500 ≈ 1.8181818e-4.

So (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (1.6666667e-4 - 1.8181818e-4) = -1.5151515e-5 1/K.

Wait, wait, no, 1/6000 is less than 1/5500 because 6000 >5500. So 1/6000 -1/5500 is negative.

So (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) )= (-500)/(33,000,000) )= -5e2 / 3.3e7 = approx -1.515e-5 1/K.

So the exponent becomes (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) = 99500 K * (-1.515e-5 1/K) ) = 99500 * (-1.515e-5) = let's compute that.

99500 is approx 1e5, so 1e5 * 1.5e-5 = 1.5. So with the negative sign, it's -1.5.

Wait, but let's compute more accurately.

99500 * (-1.515e-5) = 99500 * (-0.00001515) = let's see, 99500 * 0.00001515 = ?

0.00001515 is 1.515e-5. So 99500 * 1.515e-5 = 99500 * 0.00001515.

99500 * 0.00001 is 0.995.

99500 *0.00000515 = 99500 *5.15e-6 = about 0.512.

So adding 0.995 and 0.512 gives approximately 1.507.

So the total is 99500 * (-1.515e-5) ≈ -1.507.

So the exponent is approximately -1.507.

So R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) ) = exp( -1.507 )

Wait no, wait: R1/R2 is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots.

Which is [ (g2/g1) exp( -E/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -E/(k T2) ) ) ] = exp( (E/(k T2)) - (E/(k T1)) ) )

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the ratio is R1/R2 = [ exp(-E/(k T1)) ] / [ exp( -E/(k T2) ) ] = exp( [ -E/(k T1) + E/(k T2) ] ) = exp( E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, that's different from what I did earlier. Because in the initial approach, I had (1/T1 -1/T2) which is negative. But according to this, R1/R2 would be exp( E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ), which is the same as exp( - (E/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) )

Which is the same as exp( (E/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1 )) )

Which is the same as exp( (E/(k)) * ( - (1/T1 -1/T2) ) )

So yeah, that gives the same exponent. So in the earlier step, I have the exponent as (E/(k) ) (1/T1 -1/T2 ), which is negative. So R1/R2 = exp( -1.507 )

So exp(-1.507) is approximately what?

I remember that exp(-1) is about 0.3679, exp(-1.5) is about 0.2231, exp(-1.6) is about 0.2019.

Wait, but 1.507 is just a bit more than 1.5, so exp(-1.507) is a bit less than 0.2231.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought R1/R2 is greater than 1 because when T is higher, the ratio is higher. But according to this, R1/R2 is exp(-1.507), which is about 0.22. So that's less than 1. That can't be right, because when T is higher, the ratio should be higher, meaning R1 is larger than R2. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, let's go back.

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the negative exponent becomes less negative, making exp(...) larger. So yes, higher T gives higher n2/n1.

So when the star has no spots (T=6000K), n2/n1 is higher than when it has spots (5500K).

So the ratio when no spots is R1 = n2/n1 (no spots) = (g2/g1) exp( -E/(k *6000) )

When spots: R2 = (g2/g1) exp( -E/(k *5500) )

So R1/R2 = exp( (E/(k)) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Which is positive. Because 1/5500>1/6000.

So the exponent is positive, so R1/R2 is exp( positive ), which is larger than 1.

Wait, so my earlier calculation had a mistake in the sign when I computed the exponent. I think I should have (1/T2 - 1/T1) in the exponent. Let me recast it.

So the correct exponent is (E/(k)) (1/T2 -1/T1 )

But 1/T2 = 1/5500, 1/T1=1/6000.

So 1/T2 -1/T1 = (6000 -5500)/(6000 *5500) ) = 500/(33,000,000) ) = 5e2 / 3.3e7 = approx 1.515e-5.

So (E/(k)) (1/T2 -1/T1) ) = 99500 K * (1.515e-5 1/K) ) = 99500 * 1.515e-5 = let's compute.

1e5 *1.5e-5 = 1.5. So 99500 is almost 1e5, so 99500 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 1.507.

So the exponent is 1.507.

So R1/R2 = exp(1.507) ≈ ?

I know that exp(1.6) is about 4.953, exp(1.5) is about 4.4817, exp(1.507) would be a bit more than 4.48, maybe around 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the factor is approximately 4.5.

So the answer should be C.

The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when a star transitions from having no spots (effective temperature \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \)) to having spots (effective temperature \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \)). The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_2 \) and \( g_1 \) are the statistical weights, \( E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The energy difference \( E_2 - E_1 \) corresponds to the wavelength of the transition, \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \), calculated as:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) is Planck's constant, \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light, and \( \lambda = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). Substituting these values gives:

\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
E \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.58 \, \text{eV}.
\]

The ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels when the star has no spots (\( R_1 \)) and when it has spots (\( R_2 \)) is given by:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
\]

where \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \). Substituting \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \), \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \), and \( E = 8.58 \, \text{eV} \):

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

\[
\frac{E}{k} = \frac{8.58}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99500 \, \text{K}.
\]

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(99500 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5}\right) = \exp(1.507).
\]

Using \( \exp(1.507) \approx 4.5 \), the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately 4.5. Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) ~4.5**

Answer: C
