Okay, I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics question. Hmm, so the problem is about two quantum states with different energies, E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. The question is about finding the energy difference between them so they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It relates the uncertainty in energy and time. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy and Δt is the uncertainty in time. Or wait, is it ħ divided by something else? I think it's ħ/(2π) or something like that. Maybe the exact factor isn't too critical here.

So the idea is that the energy uncertainty should be small enough to distinguish between the two states. If the energy difference is much larger than the uncertainty, then we can resolve them. Alternatively, the energy width of each state is determined by its lifetime.

Oh wait, the lifetime is related to the energy uncertainty. The energy uncertainty ΔE is approximately ħ divided by the lifetime τ. So ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.

Wait, but in this problem, each state has its own lifetime. So for E1, the lifetime is 1e-9 seconds. So ΔE1 would be ħ/(1e-9), and for E2, ΔE2 would be ħ/(1e-8). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that applies directly here, because each state's lifetime gives the uncertainty in measuring its own energy. But maybe the question is about the spectral line width. Because when you have a state with a short lifetime, its energy is more uncertain, so the spectral line is broader.

Wait, no. The question is about distinguishing the two energy levels. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than the sum of their energy uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainty, the lines would overlap and you couldn't tell them apart.

So the energy difference ΔE should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2. Let's compute that.

First, what is ħ? I think it's approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But wait, the options are in eV, so I should convert units.

Wait, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So let's calculate ħ in eV·s. Let me compute that.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s
Convert J to eV: 1 J = 1/(1.602e-19) eV ≈ 6.242e18 eV.

So, ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 * 6.242e18 eV·s ≈ (1.0545718 * 6.242) e-16 eV·s ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Now, let's compute ΔE for each state.

For E1, τ = 1e-9 sec.

ΔE1 = ħ / τ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV.

Wait, that's 6.582e-7 eV. That's 0.0006582 eV. Hmm, but wait, wait. I think I might have made a mistake because I remember that ħ is about 6.58e-16 eV·s. So for τ = 1e-9, 6.58e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.58e-7 eV. Which is 6.58e-7 eV, or 0.000000658 eV. That seems really small.

Wait, but looking at the options, the smallest energy difference is 1e-11 eV (option B), which is way smaller than 6.58e-7 eV. So if the energy difference is smaller than the sum of the uncertainties, then the states would not be distinguishable. Oh wait, no, wait. The sum of the uncertainties would be even larger. Let me compute ΔE for E2.

E2 has τ=1e-8 seconds.

ΔE2 = ħ / τ = 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-8 s = 6.582e-8 eV, which is 0.00000006582 eV.

Wait, so the uncertainties for each state are ΔE1 = 6.58e-7 eV and ΔE2 = 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait wait, no. Wait, the energy uncertainty for each state is given by ΔE = ħ / τ. So the total uncertainty is the sum of the two? Or the larger of the two? Hmm, perhaps the energy difference between E1 and E2 needs to be larger than the combined uncertainty to make the two clearly separate.

Wait, but the two states are two different energy levels. The uncertainty of one's energy doesn't directly affect the other. So perhaps the way to think about it is that in order to measure the energy difference accurately, the difference must be larger than the uncertainty in the energy measurements of each.

Wait, maybe the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties. Or perhaps the sum is not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in the system's energy, which would be dominated by the shorter lifetime.

Wait, let me think again. The energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1|. To distinguish between E1 and E2, ΔE should be greater than the uncertainty in each state's energy. So perhaps the sum of the individual uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum of the two? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I think the correct approach is that the energy resolution (the minimum ΔE that can be detected) is determined by the uncertainty principle. So for each state, the uncertainty is ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. So for E1, ΔE1 ~ 6.58e-7 eV, and E2, ΔE2 ~ 6.58e-8 eV. 

But when considering two states, the total uncertainty in detecting their energies would be on the order of ΔE_total ≈ ΔE1 + ΔE2, which would be approximately 7.24e-7 eV. So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than this sum for them to be clearly distinguished.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. Let's see how that compares.

1e-4 eV is way larger than 7.24e-7 eV. So that would definitely be distinguishable.

Wait, but let's compute the required ΔE. Let me calculate the sum of ΔE1 and ΔE2.

ΔE1 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.582e-7 eV.

ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

So ΔE_total ~ 6.582e-7 + 6.582e-8 ≈ approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between the two states should be more than about 7.2e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → smaller than 7.2e-7, so not enough.

B) 1e-11 eV → 0.000001e-6 → way too small.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → 1e-4 is 1e3 times larger than 1e-7, so definitely larger than 7.2e-7.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV → smaller than 7.2e-7.

So the only option larger than 7.2e-7 eV is option C, 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but wait. I might have misunderstood the problem. Because the question says "their lifetime" but perhaps each energy level has its own lifetime. Oh, wait, the question says "Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 1e-9 sec and 1e-8 sec, respectively." So each has its own lifetime. So the energy uncertainty for E1 is 6.58e-7 eV, and for E2 it's 6.58e-8 eV. 

So the total uncertainty would be in the measurement. Wait, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the maximum of their individual uncertainties, or perhaps the sum.

Wait, actually, when you have two lines (E1 and E2), each with their own linewidths (ΔE1 and ΔE2), the separation required to resolve them is that the difference in their energies must be larger than the sum of their linewidths. Because if the separation is less than the sum, the lines would overlap.

Ah, right! So ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So with ΔE1 = 6.58e-7 eV, ΔE2 = 6.58e-8 eV, their sum is about 7.24e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than about 7.2e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 → 1e-9 is smaller, so no.

B)1e-11 → too small.

C)1e-4 → 0.0001 eV, which is (1e-4) / (7.2e-7) ≈ 1388 times larger. So that's way larger than needed.

D)1e-8 → 1e-8 is smaller than 7.2e-7.

So the only option that meets this is C) 1e-4 eV.

But wait, I should check my calculation for ħ in eV·s. Let me double-check.

ħ = h/(2π), where h is Planck's constant. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ = 6.626e-34 / (2 * 3.1416) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s, which matches what I used earlier. 

Converting to eV·s: 1 J = 6.242e18 eV, so ħ ≈ 1.055e-34 * 6.242e18 eV·s ≈ 6.58e-16 eV·s. Yep, that's correct.

So for E1, τ=1e-9, ΔE1=6.58e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.58e-7 eV.

E2, τ=1e-8, ΔE2=6.58e-16 /1e-8=6.58e-8 eV.

Sum is 7.24e-7 eV.

So the required ΔE is bigger than that. Among the options, only option C is bigger.

So the correct answer is C.

To distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), their energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of their energy uncertainties, which are determined by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: 

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau},
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \)) and \( \tau \) is the lifetime of the state. For \( E_1 \), \( \tau = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \), and for \( E_2 \), \( \tau = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). The energy uncertainties are:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

The total uncertainty is the sum of the two:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the two states to be distinguishable, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must satisfy:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_{\text{total}} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, compare this threshold with the given options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} < 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \), so this is too small.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} < 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \), so this is too small.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} = 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This satisfies the condition.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} < 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \), so this is too small.

The only option that meets the requirement is **Option C**.
