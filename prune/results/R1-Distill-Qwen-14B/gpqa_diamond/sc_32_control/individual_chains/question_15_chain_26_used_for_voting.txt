Okay, I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit, so the researchers should observe that one. Let me try to think through this.

So both planets are Earth-like, detected via the RV method. So we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. But the question says they share the same masses. Wait, same masses as each other or same as Earth? Hmm, the question says "both of these planets have already been detected via the RV method, allowing us to know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Although both planets share the same masses..." Oh, same masses, so Planet_1 and Planet_2 have the same mass. So same M planet.

The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2. So P1 = P2 /3. Because period is shorter, Planet_1 is closer to its star.

The host stars: Planet_1's host is twice the mass of Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radii. Oh, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they have same radii. So R1 = R2.

Wait, stars with higher mass usually have larger radii, but maybe in this case, the slightly evolved star (Planet_2's host) is larger but perhaps the other star is less evolved but more massive? Hmm, but the question states that both have same radii. So R1 = R2.

The question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting is roughly given by the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, or something like that. Wait, no, the transit probability is higher when the orbital plane is aligned edge-on from our perspective. But more accurately, the probability depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's radius. Or wait, the probability is actually the ratio of the star's radius to the distance between the planet's orbit and the star, divided by something else. Hmm, maybe it's (R_star / a_planet), where a_planet is the semi-major axis (since the orbit is circular, that's the radius). So the transit probability P is approximately (R_star / a) multiplied by 1/(something), perhaps. Or wait, I think the transit probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by something else.

Wait, I think the formula for the probability of a transit is (R_star / a) * (1/(sqrt(1 + (M_planet/M_star)^2)) ) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I remember that the geometric probability of a transit is (R_star / a), but only considering if the planet's orbit is edge-on enough. So the probability is proportional to (R*/a), where R* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis (orbital radius) of the planet.

But how do we calculate a? Using Kepler's third law. The period P is related to a and the mass of the star. Kepler's third law in the form P^2 = (4π²/G(M + m)) ) a^3. Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, we can approximate M + m ≈ M. So P² ≈ (4π²/(G M)) ) a^3. So a^3 = (G M P²)/(4π²). Therefore, a is proportional to (M * P²)^(1/3).

Wait, let me write that again. Kepler's third law is P² = (4π² a^3)/(G M). So a^3 = (G M P²)/(4 π²). So a is proportional to (M P²)^(1/3). So for the two planets, a1 and a2, their a's are proportional to (M1 P1²)^(1/3) and (M2 P2²)^(1/3), respectively.

Given that Planet_1's host star has mass twice that of Planet_2's host. So M1 = 2 M2. And the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P2 /3.

So let's compute a1 and a2.

a1 = k * (M1 * P1²)^(1/3)
a2 = k * (M2 * P2²)^(1/3)

Where k is the proportionality constant.

Substituting M1 = 2 M2 and P1 = P2/3.

So a1 = k * (2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 )^(1/3)
= k * (2 M2 * P2² /9 )^(1/3)
= k * ( (2/9) M2 P2² )^(1/3 )

a2 = k * ( M2 * P2² )^(1/3 )

So a1 / a2 = [ (2/9) M2 P2² ) / ( M2 P2² ) ]^(1/3 )
= (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.2222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is about 0.606 times a2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star.

Now, the transit probability is proportional to R* / a. Since both R* are the same (R1 = R2), the probability is P ∝ 1/a. Because a is the semi-major axis, and transit probability is (R*/a) * something else, but if R* is same, then higher a would mean lower probability.

Wait, R*/a for Planet_1 is R* / a1, and for Planet_2 it's R* / a2. So transit probability for P1 is (R* / a1) and P2 is (R* / a2). Since a1 is smaller than a2, R*/a1 is larger than R*/a2. So P1 has a higher transit probability.

Wait, wait. Let me compute the ratio of their transit probabilities.

P1_prob / P2_prob = (R* / a1) / (R* /a2) ) = a2 /a1.

Because R* is same for both.

Earlier, we found a1/a2 ≈ 0.606, so a2/a1 ≈ 1.65.

So P1's probability is 1.65 times higher than P2's.

Wait, that would mean Planet_1 has a higher probability to transit, so researchers should observe Planet_1.

Looking at the options, option C says: "Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit." So option C.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, let me compute it numerically.

Compute a1 = (2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 )^(1/3)
= (2 M2 P2² /9 )^(1/3 )

a2 = (M2 P2^2 )^(1/3 )

So a1 = (2/9 )^(1/3) a2^(1/3)? Wait no, a2 is (M2 P2^2 )^(1/3 ), so a2 is proportional to (M2 P2^2 )^(1/3 ).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute a1/a2.

a1/a2 = [ (2 M2 (P2/3)^2 ) / ( M2 P2^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify numerator:
2 M2 (P2^2 /9 ) = (2/9) M2 P2^2.

Denominator: M2 P2^2.

So the ratio is (2/9) M2 P2^2 / (M2 P2^2 ) ) = 2/9.

So (a1/a2) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.2222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is about 0.606 a2. So a2 is larger than a1.

Transit probability is R*/a. So for P1, it's R*/a1, which is R*/(0.606 a2) = (1/0.606) (R*/a2) ≈ 1.65 (R*/a2).

So P1's transit probability is about 1.65 times that of P2.

Therefore, Planet_1 has a higher probability, so researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.

Looking at the options, option C is the one that says Planet_1 is preferred with ~1.65 times higher probability.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets have the same stellar radius (\( R_1 = R_2 \)), the probability depends inversely on the semi-major axis \( a \). A smaller \( a \) corresponds to a higher transit probability.

Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_*} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period and \( M_* \) is the mass of the host star, we calculate the semi-major axes of the two planets. For Planet_1, \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) and \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \). Substituting these values:

\[
a_1 \propto \left( M_1 P_1^2 \right)^{1/3} = \left( 2M_2 \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 \right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9} M_2 P_2^2 \right)^{1/3}.
\]

For Planet_2:

\[
a_2 \propto \left( M_2 P_2^2 \right)^{1/3}.
\]

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{\frac{2}{9} M_2 P_2^2}{M_2 P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \), meaning Planet_1 has a smaller orbital radius and, consequently, a higher transit probability. The transit probability ratio is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65.
\]

Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Based on this, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.
