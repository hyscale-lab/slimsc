Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics question. Let me read it again. The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, like infinities that come up in calculations. So the question is about which theory doesn't need this regularization when the energy scales are high.

Let me think about each option one by one.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, that's a classical theory, right? It doesn't involve quantum mechanics or the renormalization processes that quantum field theories do. So in classical theories, you don't have the same issues with infinities that require regularization. So maybe D is the correct answer because it's classical and doesn't require any regularization.

But wait, let me check the others. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a quantum theory. I remember that QED requires renormalization because of things like the electron self-energy, leading to divergent integrals. So you need regularization techniques to handle those. So option C would require regularization. Same goes for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), which deals with the strong force. QCD has things like the running coupling and asymptotic freedom, but I think it still needs regularization because of loop divergences. So option B requires it.

Superstring Theory is a quantum theory too, but it's different. It's a theory that combines quantum mechanics with gravity, trying to unify all forces. I've heard that string theories might not have the same kinds of divergences as traditional quantum field theories because they're background-dependent and perhaps have higher-dimensional aspects that help. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Do they need regularization? Or maybe they naturally avoid divergences because of the way strings vibrate and the structure of their theory?

Wait, another angle: regularization is a way to make a theory finite so that the infinities can be subtracted (renormalized). In some theories, like QED, you have to regularize because the perturbation series is divergent. But in others, perhaps if the theory is finite, you don't need it. But do any of these theories not require regularization?

Classical theories don't require regularization because they don't have the same divergent loop diagrams as quantum theories. So the classical version (Option D) never needs regularization.

So the correct answer should be D) Classical Electrodynamics.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the options:

1. **Option A: Superstring Theory**  
   Superstring Theory is a quantum theory that attempts to unify quantum mechanics and gravity. While it is different from traditional quantum field theories due to its string-based framework, it still involves divergences that require regularization in its calculations. Thus, it does require regularization.

2. **Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**  
   QCD is the theory of the strong interaction and involves quantum field theory. It deals with phenomena like asymptotic freedom and loop divergences, which necessitate regularization techniques. Therefore, QCD requires regularization.

3. **Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**  
   QED is the quantum field theory of electromagnetism. It is known to require renormalization due to divergences in loop diagrams, such as electron self-energy and photon vacuum polarization. Regularization is essential in QED.

4. **Option D: Classical Electrodynamics**  
   Classical Electrodynamics is a classical theory and does not involve quantum mechanics or the divergences that arise in quantum field theories. Since it is not a quantum theory, it does not require regularization.

From this analysis, the only theory that never requires regularization at high energies is **Classical Electrodynamics**.
