Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of buffer solutions and phosphate ions. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in a solution. The solution has two substances: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Each is 1 gram, and the volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. I remember that orthophosphate is PO4^3-, but I also know that phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH, especially since H3PO4 is a triprotic acid.

Wait, the problem gives the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So the pKa values are around 2.12 for Ka1 (since pKa1 = -log(7.5e-3)), pKa2 around 7.21 (from Ka2), and pKa3 about 11.74 (from Ka3). Right, that means phosphate can exist as H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

But wait, the problem is specifically about orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Hmm, no, orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-, but I might be mixing terms. Alternatively, sometimes ortho refers to the HPO4^2- form. Wait, no, I think orthophosphate is the PO4^3- ion. But let me make sure.

Anyway, the solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let's think about what each of those salts dissociates into.

KH2PO4 (which is potassium hydrogen phosphate) would dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. So when it dissociates, it gives 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water molecules. So the relevant ions here are HPO4^2-.

So the solution has H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4). Oh, right, that means this is a buffer solution because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. Because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, so H2PO4^- is the acid (HA) and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base (A^-).

Wait, so the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which corresponds to the second dissociation of H3PO4. So the relevant Ka is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8.

So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). But wait, since the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate, which I think is HPO4^2-, wait no, wait. No, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

H3PO4 can lose three protons:

1. H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
2. H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
3. HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

So, the orthophosphate ion is either HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Wait, orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, so that's PO4^3-. But in this solution, I have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, no. Wait, the question is about orthophosphate, so I think that's PO4^3-. But in the solution, the phosphate species are from KH2PO4 (H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4·2H2O (HPO4^2-). So, the PO4^3- concentration would be very low because the solution is buffered around the second pKa, which is ~7.2. So PO4^3- comes from the third dissociation, which has a very small Ka (1.8e-12), so at pH 7, the concentration is negligible. So the orthophosphate (PO4^3-) is probably the third species, but maybe the question is referring to the HPO4^2- as ortho? Or perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think orthophosphate usually refers to the PO4^3- ion. So if that's the case, in this solution, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very small. Because the pH is around the second pKa, so HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are the main species.

Alternatively, sometimes the term orthophosphate can refer to HPO4^2-. Hmm, but I think I'm mixing up terms. Let me double-check.

Wait, the term 'orthophosphate' refers to the phosphate ions as they are, so PO4^3- is orthophosphate. So in this solution, I have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So, the concentration of orthophosphate (PO4^3-) would be from the third dissociation. But since the pH is around 7, and the third Ka is 1.8e-12, which is way lower than 1e-7, so PO4^3- would be negligible. Therefore, the concentration is very low, and I need to find it using the Ka3.

But wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me go back to the problem.

The problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I'm going to assume is PO4^3-.

So, to find [PO4^3-], I can think of it as the concentration that comes from the third dissociation of H3PO4.

But in this solution, I have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So the HPO4^2- can dissociate further into PO4^3- and H+.

But considering that the solution is buffered around pH near 7, which is higher than the pKa2 (7.21), so it's near the pKa2. Wait, actually, the pKa2 is about 7.21, so if the solution's pH is around that, the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But in any case, the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So, the concentration of PO4^3- is going to be determined by the third dissociation: HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

Given that, the concentration of PO4^3- would be determined by the Ka3 and the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but in the solution, the HPO4^2- comes from the Na2HPO4·2H2O, and the H2PO4^- comes from KH2PO4. So the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are known from the moles of each salt.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the concentrations of each of these ions first.

Let me start by calculating the moles of each salt.

First, KH2PO4:

Molar mass (Mw) is 136.09 g/mol.

Mass is 1.00 g, so moles = 1.00 / 136.09.

Let me compute that: 1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007344 mol.

So, moles of KH2PO4 = 0.007344 mol.

Since each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^- and one mole of K+.

So, [H2PO4^-] = 0.007344 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03672 M.

Next, Na2HPO4·2H2O:

Molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005617 mol.

Each mole of this salt gives one mole of HPO4^2- and two moles of Na+.

So, [HPO4^2-] = 0.005617 / 0.2 = 0.028085 M.

Wait, or is it? Let me check. Na2HPO4·2H2O: when it dissociates, each formula unit gives 2 Na+ and one HPO4^2-.

So yes, each mole gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So [HPO4^2-] = 0.005617 / 0.2 = 0.028085 M.

Now, the solution has H2PO4^- (0.03672 M) and HPO4^2- (0.028085 M). So, the buffer is between these two, and the pH is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation using pKa2.

So, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pKa2 is about 7.21 (from Ka2 = 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) = 7.207...).

So, plug in the values: pH = 7.207 + log(0.028085 / 0.03672).

Calculate the ratio: 0.028085 / 0.03672 ≈ 0.765.

Log(0.765) is approximately log(0.75) is about -0.1249, but let me compute it more accurately.

Log(0.765) ≈ -0.115.

So pH ≈ 7.207 - 0.115 ≈ 7.092.

So the pH is around 7.09.

But the question asks for [PO4^3-]. So, we need to find the concentration of PO4^3- in this solution.

PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

The reaction is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Given that, and knowing the pH, we can find [PO4^3-].

Because Ka = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Wait, but [H+] can be found from the pH. pH is 7.092, so [H+] = 10^(-7.092) ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

Alternatively, we can compute [H+] as 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.092) ≈ 8.21e-8.

So, plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

Rearranging:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

So:

(1.8e-12) * 0.028085 M / (8.21e-8 M) = ?

Let me calculate numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 ≈ 5.055e-14.

Divide by 8.21e-8: 5.055e-14 / 8.21e-8 ≈ 6.16e-7 M.

Wait, that's about 6.16e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. Option B is 5.48e-7, which is a bit lower.

Wait, but maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check the steps.

First, moles of KH2PO4: 1g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007344 mol.

Volume 0.2 L, so [H2PO4^-] = 0.007344 / 0.2 = 0.03672 M.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1g /177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005617 mol.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005617 /0.2 = 0.028085 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H₂PO₄^-]).

pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) inverse, so pKa2 = 7.207.

Ratio is 0.028085 / 0.03672 ≈ 0.765.

Log(0.765) is about -0.114. So pH =7.207-0.114=7.093.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.093) ≈ 8.17e-8 M.

Then [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / 8.17e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = 5.0553e-14.

Divide by 8.17e-8: 5.0553e-14 /8.17e-8 ≈ 6.185e-7.

So approximately 6.185e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is very close. So perhaps that's the right answer.

But wait, did I make any mistake in the calculations? Let me re-calculate.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should compute the pH more accurately.

Wait, let me compute the exact value of the ratio.

[HPO4^2- ] is 0.028085, [H2PO4^-] is 0.03672.

Ratio = 0.028085 / 0.03672 ≈ 0.7655.

Log(0.7655) = ?

Using a calculator approach: log(0.7655) ≈ -0.1138.

So pH = 7.207 -0.1138 =7.0932.

[H+] = 10^(-7.0932) = antilog(-7.0932).

Let me compute that.

7.0932 → 7 + 0.0932.

So, 10^(-7.0932) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0932).

10^(-7) is 1e-7.

10^(-0.0932) ≈ 0.821.

So, 1e-7 * 0.821 = 8.21e-8.

So [H+] is 8.21e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / (8.21e-8).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = 5.0553e-14.

Denominator: 8.21e-8.

So 5.0553e-14 / 8.21e-8 = (5.0553 /8.21) * (1e-14 /1e-8) )= (0.6159) * 1e-6 = 6.159e-7.

Wait, that's approximately 6.16e-7 M. So, the answer should be close to 6.16e-7 M.

Looking at the options:

A) 6.24e-7 M

B)5.48e-7 

C)2.81e-7 

D)3.97e-7 

So option A is the closest. But wait, my calculation gives 6.16e-7, which is slightly less than option A (6.24e-7). Hmm. Let me check if I made any miscalculations in the exact numbers.

Wait, perhaps more precise calculation is needed. Let me recalculate the numerator and denominator.

Molar masses:

KH2PO4: 136.09 g/mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: Mw is (Na=23, HPO4 is 96 (since H=1, P=31, O4=64 → 1+31+64=96), plus 2 H2O (18*2=36) → 23*2 +96 +36 = 46 +96=142 +36=178. So 178 g/mol. Wait, but the given Mw is 177.99, which is close enough.

So moles of KH2PO4: 1 /136.09 = approx 0.007344.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1 /177.99 = approx 0.005617.

So [H2PO4^-] = 0.007344 /0.2 =0.03672 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005617 /0.2= 0.028085 M.

Ratio: 0.028085 / 0.03672 = 0.7655.

Log(0.7655): Let's compute more accurately.

Log(0.7655) → since log(2) is 0.3010, log(3)=0.4771, etc. Alternatively, using exact calculation.

Using calculator-like approach:

We can compute log(0.7655) by noting that 0.7655 is 765.5 x10^-3.

Log(765.5)= log(7.655e2) = log(7.655) +2.

Log(7.655) ≈ 0.8848.

So log(765.5) is 2.8848.

So log(0.7655) is 2.8848 - 3 = -0.1152.

So pH = pKa2 + (-0.1152) → 7.207 -0.1152=7.0918.

So pH=7.0918.

[H+]=10^(-7.0918)=?

Compute 7.0918 as 7 +0.0918.

10^(-7) = 1e-7.

10^(-0.0918) = ?

We can calculate 10^0.0918 = approx 1.237 (since 10^0.09= approx 1.23, and 0.0918 is slightly higher).

Wait, 10^0.0918: let me compute this.

I know that 10^0.07918 ≈ 1.2 (since log(1.2)=0.07918).

Wait, 0.0918 is about 1.23? Let me compute more accurately.

We can use the formula ln(10^x)=x ln(10), so ln(a)=x.

Another approach: 10^0.0918 = e^(0.0918 * ln(10)).

ln(10)=2.302585.

So 0.0918 * 2.302585 ≈ 0.2113.

e^0.2113 ≈ 1.235.

So 10^(-0.0918)=1/(10^0.0918)≈1/1.235≈0.810.

So [H+]=1e-7 * 0.810=8.10e-8 M.

So [H+] is 8.10e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+].

Ka3=1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-]=0.028085 M.

So (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) = 5.0553e-14.

Divide by 8.10e-8: 5.0553e-14 /8.10e-8 = (5.0553 /8.10)* 1e-6.

5.0553 /8.10 ≈0.6241.

So 0.6241e-6 M =6.241e-7 M.

Ah, so that's approximately 6.24e-7 M, which matches option A.

Wait, so why did I get 6.16e-7 earlier? Ah, because in the first approximation, I used 8.21e-8 for [H+], which is 8.21e-8. But with more precise calculation of [H+] as 8.10e-8, the denominator is 8.10e-8, leading to 6.24e-7.

So the correct [PO4^3-] is about 6.24e-7 M, which is option A.

But wait, I think I made a mistake in one of the steps. Let me check.

Another thing: the problem asks for orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-.

So, the concentration is 6.24e-7 M. So option A is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and use the third dissociation constant of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄), Ka₃ = 1.8 × 10⁻¹². The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ (molar mass = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (molar mass = 177.99 g/mol), dissolved in 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The relevant species in solution are H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄) and HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O). The concentration of PO₄³⁻ is determined by the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻:

\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the moles and concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- **Moles of KH₂PO₄**:
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007344 \, \text{mol}
  \]
  \[
  [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume (L)}} = \frac{0.007344}{0.2} \approx 0.03672 \, \text{M}
  \]

- **Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005617 \, \text{mol}
  \]
  \[
  [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume (L)}} = \frac{0.005617}{0.2} \approx 0.028085 \, \text{M}
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the pH of the solution
The solution is a buffer containing H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, corresponding to the second dissociation of H₃PO₄. The relevant pKa is:
\[
\text{pKa}_2 = -\log(\text{Ka}_2) = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.21
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + \log\left(\frac{0.028085}{0.03672}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + \log(0.765) \approx 7.21 - 0.115 = 7.095
\]

### Step 3: Calculate [PO₄³⁻]
The concentration of PO₄³⁻ is determined using the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻:
\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]
Rearranging:
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]

- **[H⁺]** is calculated from pH:
  \[
  [\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.095} \approx 8.10 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
  \]

- **Substitute values**:
  \[
  [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028085)}{8.10 \times 10^{-8}}
  \]
  \[
  [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.055 \times 10^{-14}}{8.10 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
  \]

### Final Answer:
The concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) is approximately **6.24 × 10⁻⁷ M**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A
