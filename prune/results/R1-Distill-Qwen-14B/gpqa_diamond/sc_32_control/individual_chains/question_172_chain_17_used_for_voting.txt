Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar atmospheres, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, this has to do with the Boltzmann equation and the excitation levels in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). So the idea is that the ratio of excited to ground state atoms depends on temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is proportional to the exponential of ( -ΔE / (k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. More specifically, the ratio is given by N_upper / N_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) or maybe the reciprocal, depending on which level is which. Wait, I think it's N_upper / N_lower = exp( -h c Δv / (k T) ), but in this case, they've given the energy difference ΔE, so it's similar.

Wait, or wait, no. The ratio is actually N_upper / N_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where g's are the statistical weights. But the question says the energy difference between the considered energy levels is approximately 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE is given.

In this problem, the excited state is the upper level, and the ground state is the lower. So N_1 for star_1 and N_2 for star_2. It's given that N1/N2 is 2, but wait, not exactly: the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So the ratio (excited in 1)/(excited in 2) is 2. So, (N1_upper)/(N2_upper) = 2.

Wait, no, wait. The question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So for the same transition, the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So the ratio would be (N1_upper / N1_lower) / (N2_upper / N2_lower) ) = 2? Or is the ratio N1_upper/N2_upper = 2? Hmm. Let me think.

Wait, the question says that the excitation is twice as much. So if star_1's excited atoms are twice as many as in star_2, then the ratio (N1_upper)/(N2_upper) = 2. But wait, that's not necessarily correct because each star's ratio depends on its own temperature.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Let's denote for star 1: the ratio of excited to unexcited is (N1_upper)/(N1_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) multiplied by statistical weight factors, but assuming the statistical weights are the same for both stars, they would cancel out when taking the ratio of the ratios.

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention statistical weights, so perhaps for simplicity, we can assume they are the same for both stars, so the g factors cancel out. So the ratio of N_upper to N_lower is just proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

So the ratio for star_1 is N1_upper / N1_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

Similarly, for star_2, N2_upper / N2_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But the question states that the excited atoms in star_1 are twice as many as in star_2. But wait, we need to see the ratio of the excited atoms. Are we looking at the same transition? Or same element?

Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So I think it's that the number of excited atoms in that level is twice as much in star_1. But wait, that's not exactly correct because the total number of iron atoms is different in each star. Hmm, but perhaps the ratio is considering the same number density or same conditions. Maybe it's the ratio of the excitation: the fraction of excited atoms is higher in star_1.

Wait, perhaps the ratio (N1_upper / N1_total) / (N2_upper / N2_total) ) = 2. But that's another way to think about it. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the excitation is (N1_upper / N1_lower) / (N2_upper / N2_lower) ) = 2. That might make more sense because both N_upper and N_lower are in the same star.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps for the same energy level, the fraction that is excited (N_upper) is twice as high in star_1.

But wait, the excitation level is the population in that specific energy level. So, the number of atoms in the specific upper level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But that's not possible unless we know the total number of atoms, which we don't. So perhaps the ratio is (N1_upper) / (N2_upper) = 2. But that would imply that the number of excited atoms is twice as high, but without knowing the total number of atoms, it's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is expressed as the ratio of excited to unexcited, so (N_upper/N_lower) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. That would make more sense.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me approach this step by step.

Let me denote:

For star 1: ratio is (N1_upper)/(N1_lower) = R1.

For star 2: ratio is (N2_upper)/(N2_lower) = R2.

The problem states that R1 = 2 * R2.

Because the excitation is twice as high in star_1.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The question says that the excited atoms are twice as excited in star_1 as in star_2. So perhaps the ratio of excited atoms to the total is higher in star_1. So the ratio (N1_upper/(N1_upper + N1_lower)) = 2 * (N2_upper/(N2_upper + N2_lower)). But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio (N1_upper / N2_upper) = 2. But that's possible only if the lower levels are the same for each star, which isn't necessarily the case.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to take the ratio of the two excitation ratios.

So R1 = (N1_upper)/(N1_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

R2 = (N2_upper)/(N2_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Given that R1 = 2 * R2.

So, (N1_upper/N1_lower) = 2 * (N2_upper/N2_lower).

Taking the ratio R1/R2 = 2.

So,

(R1/R2) = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))]/[exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] = exp[ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ].

Because,

exp(a)/exp(b) = exp(a - b).

So, a is (-ΔE/(k T1)), b is (-ΔE/(k T2)), so a - b is [ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ].

Which is ΔE/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1].

So,

exp[ ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ] = 2.

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

But the question says that the energy difference ΔE is approximately 1.38e-23 J. Oh, wait, 1.38e-23 J is an interesting number. Because Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE is equal to k.

Wait, ΔE = 1.38e-23 J = k_B * 1 K. So,

ΔE = k_B * T, where T is 1 K.

Wait, but in this case, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. So,

ΔE = k_B * T0, where T0 = 1 K.

So, moving back to the equation:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

Substituting ΔE = k * 1.

So,

(1) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

Which can be rewritten as:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

But this is (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2).

Alternatively, factor that:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) → (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Wait, because:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Hmm, looking at the options:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Which is the same as equation I have.

So the correct equation must be ln(2) equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up T1 and T2.

In our equation:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2).

Which is [T1 - T2]/(T1 T2) = ln(2).

So yes, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, but the options are:

Option D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Yes, that matches.

So the correct answer is option D.

The question involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann equation is used to relate the ratio of excited to unexcited atoms in a specific energy level to the temperature of the star. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which is equal to \( k_B \cdot T_0 \), where \( k_B \) is Boltzmann's constant and \( T_0 = 1 \, \text{K} \).

For star 1 and star 2, the ratios of excited to unexcited atoms are given by:

\[
\frac{N_{\text{upper}}}{N_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T}\right).
\]

Let \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) represent these ratios for stars 1 and 2, respectively. The problem states that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2, so:

\[
R_1 = 2 R_2.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann equation for \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \), we have:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k_B} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k_B \cdot 1 \, \text{K} \), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\exp\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting this in terms of \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \):

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches option D, which states:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
