Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. Alright, the question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits all the given data.

First, let me list out the data provided:

1. FTIR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches because of the hydrogen bonding. So, maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid? But wait, a very broad peak could also be from an -OH group, perhaps in a phenol or alcohol structure.

2. There are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. The 1650 peak might be an aromatic ring (C=C stretching) or another carbonyl like an ester. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl group, like in an aromatic ester or something with conjugation.

3. The ¹H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are the ones attached to a double bond, usually appearing as a multiplet around δ 4.5-7 ppm. So, the compound has a double bond, maybe in an alkene or part of a ring like an aromatic ring, or possibly an ester's vinyl group.

4. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, m/z 45 is a common fragment. Let me think: 45 is the mass of C3H7O, but wait, 45 is actually the mass of (CH3)2CHO (which is 45), but maybe more likely, the fragment could be from something like a carbonyl group breaking off. Alternatively, 45 could correspond to (CH2)2O, but I'm not sure. Wait, 45 can also be (CH3)2CH-O, but maybe the more common one is from a ketone or an ester. Alternatively, a fragment like CH3-CO-O-R losing something. Wait, another thought: 45 is the mass of a methyl ester group? Or perhaps a CH3CO+ ion? Let me think: CH3CO is 43, so maybe m/z 45 is CH3CO-O or something else.

Wait, another approach: what structures give a fragment of 45? Maybe a benzene ring with a substituent that breaks off. Or perhaps a ketone group. Alternatively, a fragment with a carbonyl and some hydrogens. Wait, 45 is C3H7O (since (3*12)+(7*1)+(16) = 36+7+16=60? No, wait 3*12 is 36, 7*1 is 7, 16 is 16; 36+7=43 +16=59. Hmm, maybe that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's C2H5O2? No, 2*12=24,5=5, 32 is 24+5=29 +32=61, which is more than 45. Maybe it's a different approach. Alternatively, the fragment could be a CH2=CH-O group, but I'm not sure.

Now, the options are four compounds: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

Let me calculate the molecular formulas and see their possible structures.

Option A: C6H12O2. The formula is C6H12O2. The degree of unsaturation can be calculated. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming X=0 and N=0. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So one degree of unsaturation: could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc. Wait, but wait: O is diatomic? No, for the formula, the degree of unsaturation is (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2=(14-12)/2=1. So, one degree. So either a ring and a double bond, or a triple bond, or two rings.

But wait, the IR shows a peak at 1700, which is a carbonyl group. So likely, the compound has a carbonyl. So maybe a ring with an ester or ketone group.

Option B: C6H10O. The formula is C6H10O. Degree of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees—could be a ring and a double bond, or two rings, or two double bonds, etc. But since the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, perhaps a double bond is present.

Option C: C6H10O2. The formula is C6H10O2. Degree of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2=(14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. So same as B, but with an additional oxygen. So maybe a ring and a carbonyl group, or two carbonyl groups.

Option D: C6H12O. Formula is C6H12O. Degree of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12)/2=(14-12)/2=1. So one degree, likely a ring or a double bond.

Now, looking at the IR data: the broad peak at 3000 is likely an -OH group. So the compound has an -OH. So looking at the options, which have an O count that allows for an -OH. Let's see:

Option A: O2. So possible either two -OH groups (like a diol) or one -OH and another O-containing group (like an ester or ketone).

Option B: O. So one O. So maybe an alcohol (but if it's an alcohol without another O, but the IR has a peak at 1700, which is a carbonyl. Hmm, alcohol's O is in -OH, but if another O is present, it's something else. Wait, in option B, it's C6H10O. So one O in the molecule. But in the IR, we have a peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, which is a carbonyl. So if the molecule is an aldehyde or ketone, but that would require another O. Wait, no. Wait, aldehyde has a carbonyl group (C=O) and an -OH? No, wait, an aldehyde is RCHO. That's just one O. So if the compound is an aldehyde, the IR would show a peak around 2820 and 2720 (stretching for the CHO group), but the IR here shows a broad peak at 3000 which is probably -OH. So maybe an aldehyde and an -OH group? But that would require two O atoms, which would be O2. So that would mean the formula should have two O's. Looking at the options, which have O2? Options A and C.

So in option B, O=1. So if the IR shows a carbonyl (1700) and an -OH (broad at 3000), that would require two O's. So B (O=1) wouldn't fit unless the carbonyl and -OH share an O. But that's not possible. So that suggests that the correct formula must have two O atoms, so options A or C.

So now we can eliminate options B and D because they have only one O, and we have both a carbonyl (which needs O) and an -OH (another O), requiring two O's. So the correct answer must be either A (C6H12O2) or C (C6H10O2).

Now, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are in a double bond, so the molecule has a double bond. So the degree of unsaturation needs to account for that. Let me recalculate the degrees considering that.

Wait, for option A: C6H12O2. The degree of unsaturation is 1. If there's a double bond, that's one degree. So that would mean the other degree must be from something else, like a ring. So maybe a cyclic ester or a cyclic ketone with an -OH group.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degree of unsaturation is 2. A double bond (1) and a ring (1), total 2. So that fits.

But wait, the mass spectrum fragment is m/z 45. Let me think about what that could correspond to. The molecular ion or a fragment. For a molecule with formula C6H12O2, m/z would be higher. But a fragment at 45 could be from a part of the molecule.

Alternatively, let's think about possible structures.

If the compound is an ester, the structure would be R-O-CO-R'. Esters have the carbonyl group (so 1700 cm⁻¹), and if there's an -OH group somewhere else, that would explain the broad peak. Wait, but esters don't have an -OH. Hmm, wait, unless the ester is also a phenol, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe a glycolic ester, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. A lactone has an ester group (so 1700 cm⁻¹) and perhaps an -OH if it's a diol that cyclized. Alternatively, maybe a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group. Hmm.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. So perhaps the compound has both a carbonyl and a double bond, plus an -OH group.

Let me consider the options again.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), that has two O's. Possible structures could be something like a substituted cyclic ester with a double bond. Alternatively, maybe a diester, but that's less likely.

Wait, another approach: the mass spec. The fragment at m/z=45. Let me think about what that could be.

45 is the mass of C3H7O? Let's calculate: C=12*3=36, H=7=7, O=16: total 36+7+16=59. No, that's not 45. Hmm. Maybe it's C2H5O2? 24 +5 +32=61. No. Alternatively, maybe it's something like CH2O plus something else. Wait, 45 could be (CH3)2CHO, which is 45. But that's 4 carbons: (CH3)2CHO is C3H7O. Wait, (CH3)2CHO has a molecular formula C3H6O? Wait, wait, (CH3)2CHO: the structure is (CH3)2CHOH? No, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's CH3COOCH3 (methyl acetate) which is C3H6O2. But the fragment is m/z=45. Wait, let me calculate the m/z for (CH3)2CHO: molecular formula is C3H6O. The molecular weight is 3*12 +6*1 +16=36+6+16=58. So, maybe a fragment is losing part of the molecule. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is an acylium ion, like CH3CO+ which is 43, but 43 isn't 45.

Wait, another idea: m/z=45 corresponds to CH2=CH-O- something? Or maybe a ketene ion? Hmm, I'm not recalling exactly. Alternatively, the fragment could be from the loss of a larger group. Suppose the molecule is something like an ester with a benzene ring. Wait, but we're dealing with a six-carbon compound, so perhaps a cyclohexene derivative.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a methyl group attached to something. Wait, maybe the ester group breaks off, giving a fragment that includes the carbonyl group. For example, in an ester R-O-CO-R', the cleavage could lead to R-O-CO as a fragment. Wait, the molecular weight of R-O-CO would depend on R, but perhaps if R is CH2CH2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the loss of a propyl group or something. Wait, maybe the fragment is a ketone group. For example, if there's a ketone, the fragment could be the carbonyl plus some adjacent groups.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from the loss of a larger substituent. Let me try a different approach. Let me think about each option's possible structures and see which could produce a fragment at 45.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures: maybe a diol with an ester group, or a cyclic ester (lactone). If it's a lactone, the ring would be five or six-membered. For example, a six-membered ring lactone would have an ester group. But where would a fragment at 45 come from?

Option C: C6H10O2. Structure possibilities: maybe a cyclic ester with a double bond, or a diester with a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps a benzene ring with a substituent, but wait, the formula is C6H10O2. Benzene is C6H6. So substituents would take away more hydrogens, but with two oxygen atoms. Alternatively, maybe something like methyl acrylate? No, that's C4H6O2. Wait, but our compound is C6H10O2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the structure is a cyclohexene ring with an ester substituent. For example, an ester group attached to a cyclohexene. That would account for the vinyl (double bond) protons in the NMR. So, for example, something like cyclohexene with an ester group, which would have a carbonyl (1700 cm⁻¹), an -OH (broad peak at 3000), but wait, where would the -OH come from in that case? Oh, maybe it's a diol ester. Wait, perhaps a diester with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a substituted maleic anhydride, but that's probably more complex than needed.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like methyl vinyl ketone, but then the O count would be one. Hmm, but we need two O's.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a dihydroxy ester. For example, something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH. But that's a diol, and the ester would require a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic hemiacetal or something like that. Not sure.

Wait, let's think about the mass spec again. The fragment at 45. Let me think of what might have a mass of 45. For example, the molecular formula C3H7O2 would be 3*12=36, 7=7, 32=32. Total 36+7+32=75. No, that's too high. Alternatively, the fragment could be C2H5O2, which is 2*12=24, 5=5, 32=32. 24+5+32=61. No. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe the fragment is a ketone group with a methyl group. For instance, (CH3)CO. That would be 43 (12*2 +16 +3*1=24 +16+3=43). No, that's 43, not 45. Wait, wait, 45 is 43 +2. Hmm, perhaps a fragment with an oxygen plus another group.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the options. Let's compute the molecular weight for each and see what the possible fragments could be.

Option A: C6H12O2. The molecular weight is (6*12) +12 + (2*16) =72 +12 +32=116.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight:72 +10 +32=114.

So the molecular ion would be around 114 or 116. The fragment is at 45, so that's a significant portion of the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a cleavage product. For example, if the molecule is an ester, the cleavage could break the ester into two parts. Suppose the molecule is an ester with a carbonyl group. So, when the ester breaks, you get an acid and an alcohol. For example, RCOOR' would break into RCOO⁻ and R'OH. The fragment could be RCOO⁻, but that would have a higher molecular weight.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester group loses the R' part, leaving RCOO⁻ as a fragment. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the fragment at 45 could come from a ketene ion. A ketene has the structure R2C=O, and its mass would be (for R=CH2CH2) perhaps. Let me see: CH2=C=O has a molecular weight of 44 (12*2 +1*4 +16=24+4+16=44). Hmm, 44 is close to 45, but not exactly. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a butyraldehyde group or something. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from a toluene group. Wait, toluene is C7H8, but that's not relevant here. Alternatively, maybe a phenyl group, but the formula doesn't include enough carbons for that.

Let me think about the IR again. The two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is probably a carbonyl. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester where the carbonyl is conjugated with an aromatic ring, or perhaps an aromatic ring's C=C stretch. But then, the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which is more likely an -OH stretch.

Wait, another possibility: the 1650 peak is from an aromatic ring (C=C). So the compound has both a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring. But I thought the molecular formula is C6H10O2 or C6H12O2. Wait, benzene is C6H6. If the compound has a benzene ring, then the rest would be substituents. For example, if the formula is C6H10O2, that would mean two substituents on the benzene: each substituent would take up a certain number of hydrogens.

Wait, let's think: benzene is C6H6. If the substituents add 4 hydrogens in total, then the formula would be C6H10O2. How? For example, two substituents each adding two hydrogens. Maybe an ester group and a hydroxyl group. Wait, an ester group is O-CO-O-R. Hmm, but that would require more carbons. Alternatively, maybe a methoxy group and an ester group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a hydroxyl group and an ester substituent. For example, something like phenyl acetate, but that's more of an ester without an -OH.

Alternatively, perhaps a benzene ring with a vinyl group and an ester group. Wait, then the formula might not fit. Let me compute:

Benzene (C6H5-) plus a substituent like -OOCR.

Wait, for example, if the substituent is an ester group like O-CO-CH2CH2-OH. Hmm, that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a substituted cyclohexane with an ester and an -OH group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach: considering the NMR. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond, so maybe the structure has an ester and a double bond. For example, a vinyl ester. The structure could be something like CH2=CHCOOR. But that would have a vinyl group (the double bond) and an ester group (carbonyl at 1700). But then, where would the -OH come from? That would require another oxygen.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diester with a double bond. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the options with O2 are A and C. The mass spec fragment at 45. Let me think about the possible structures for these options and see which could produce a fragment of 45.

For option C: C6H10O2. The molecular weight is 114. A fragment at 45 would be about 40% of the molecular weight, which suggests it's a significant part of the molecule. Maybe it's a cleavage product.

Suppose the molecule is an ester with a six-membered ring. Wait, like a cyclic ester (lactone) but with an -OH group elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the ester is part of a larger structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a diol with an ester group. But that's getting a bit vague.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclopentene derivative. Wait, cyclopentene is five-membered, but the formula is C6H10O2. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group. For instance, something like cyclohexene with an ester substituent and an -OH group.

If the molecule has a double bond (vinyl H in NMR), a carbonyl (from IR), and an -OH (broad peak), then the structure must incorporate all three.

Let me think about the possible structures of option C: C6H10O2.

One possible structure is a substituted cyclopentane with an ester and a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The IR shows a peak at 1700 (C=O) and 1650 (possibly conjugated C=O or aromatic C=C). The broad peak at 3000 is for -OH.

So maybe the structure is a conjugated ester with a double bond and a phenolic -OH group. But that would require more carbons, perhaps.

Alternatively, the compound could be a hydroxyl-substituted enol ester.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like methyl vinyl ketone, but that's only C4H6O. Wait, our formula is C6H10O2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a dihydroxy ester, like HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH, but that's C6H12O4, which doesn't match any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic hemiacetal ester which is a bit complicated.

Wait, maybe it's a benzene ring with two substituents: an ester group and a hydroxyl group. For example, phenyl ester with a hydroxyl. But benzene is C6H6. If you add an -OOCR group (ester) and an -OH group, the formula would be:

Benzene (C6H5-) + OOCR (ester) + OH.

Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O-R. So, substituting two H's on benzene with O-CO-O-R and OH. So, the formula would be C6H5-O-CO-O-R + OH. But that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a substituted cyclohexene with an ester and an -OH. Let's say the formula is C6H10O2. So, the degrees of unsaturation are two (a double bond and a ring). So, perhaps a cyclohexene ring with an ester group and an -OH substituent.

Wait, but how would that look? Let me imagine a cyclohexene ring with an ester substituent (like an ester group attached to one carbon) and an -OH on another carbon. That would give the necessary degrees of unsaturation.

In that case, the IR would show the C=O (1700), the C=C (1650), and the -OH (3000). The NMR would show the vinyl protons from the double bond. The mass spec fragment at 45 could be from the ester group breaking off. For example, if the molecule is cyclohexene with an ester substituent, the fragment could be the ester part, perhaps the acyloxy group.

Wait, if the ester is something like O-CO-O-R, then the fragment could be the acyloxy group. For example, if R is a methyl group, the acyloxy would be O-CO-OCH3. The mass of that would be 12+16+12+16 +12 +3*(1) = Wait, no, wait: O-CO-OCH3 is O-CO-OCH3: the formula is C2H3O3. Wait, molecular weight is (2*12) +3 + (3*16) =24+3+48=75. That's higher than 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, if the ester is a methyl propionate group or something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from the cleavage of the ester group. If the molecule is R-O-CO-O-R', the cleavage could produce R-O-CO-OH (a carboxylic acid) and R'OH. The fragment would then be R-O-CO-OH, but I'm not sure about the mass.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is the loss of a larger part, leaving a smaller fragment. For example, if the molecule is (CH2)4COOCH2CH3, which is an ester, then a fragment could be CH3COO+ (43) but that's not 45.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment at 45 is a (CH2)2CO+ ion. (CH2)2CO has 3 carbons: 3*12=36, 4 H=4, 16 O=16. Total 36+4+16=56. No, that's not 45.

Alternatively, maybe it's a (CH3)CO-O- group. (CH3)COO has a mass of 59. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the fragment comes from a different part. Maybe it's an ethyl group attached to something. For example, CH2CH2O would have a mass of 44. Wait, CH2CH2O is C2H5O, which is 2*12=24 +5=5 +16=16. Total 45. Oh! Wait, that adds up to 45.

So, C2H5O is 2*12=24, 5 H=5, 16 O=16. 24+5+16=45. So a fragment with molecular formula C2H5O.

So, in the mass spectrum, a fragment of m/z 45 corresponds to C2H5O.

So, the molecule must have a part that can fragment into C2H5O.

Which of the options could have a C2H5O group?

Looking at option C: C6H10O2. If the structure is something like CH2CH2-O-CO-..., then the cleavage could produce CH2CH2-O as a fragment, which is C2H5O (45). So, perhaps the molecule is an ester where one part is ethyl (CH2CH2O) attached to a carbonyl group.

For example, the structure could be CH2CH2-O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH. Wait, but that would have more carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester like CH2CH2-O-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH2OH. No, but that's more carbons than the formula allows.

Wait, the formula is C6H10O2. So, the ester would be something like CH2CH2-O-CO-CH2CH2CH2O... but that doesn't fit. Maybe the ester is part of a cyclic structure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is an ethyl ester attached to a cyclic structure. For example, a five-membered ring with an ester group where the ethyl part could break off.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a propyl group attached to something else.

Wait, another angle: since the IR shows a broad peak at 3000, likely an -OH, and a peak at 1700 (C=O), maybe the structure is a phenol ester. For example, phenyl propionate. But phenyl propionate would have the formula C6H5O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. That formula would be C10H10O2, which doesn't match any of the options (since the options are C6H12O2, etc.). So that's probably not it.

Wait, wait. Wait, our options are all C6. So the compound must be a six-carbon molecule.

If the formula is C6H10O2, perhaps it's an ester of a carboxylic acid and an alcohol, both with three carbons. Wait, for example, methyl propionate is CH3COOCH2CH2CH3, which is C5H10O2. But we need C6. So perhaps it's ethyl propionate: CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that's more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester. For example, a six-membered ring where an ester is formed between a carboxylic acid and an alcohol group within the same molecule. So that would form a lactone. For example, a gamma or delta lactone.

A gamma lactone would have a five-membered ring (like butyrolactone). Let me compute its formula. Gamma-butyrolactone is C4H6O2. Our compound is C6H10O2, so that's two more carbons. So perhaps a substituted gamma lactone with an ethyl group or something.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think back to the mass spec. The fragment is 45, which is C2H5O. So the molecule must have a C2H5O group that can break off. Which option has such a group?

Option C is C6H10O2. If the structure is ethyl something, then yes. For example, ethyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3, which has the formula C5H8O2. But our formula is C6H10O2, so that's one more carbon and two more hydrogens. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a vinyl ester. For example, ethyl vinyl ester. Wait, the formula of ethyl vinyl acetate is C5H8O2. Again, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a cyclohexene ring with an ester substituent that includes an ethyl group. So, when the ethyl group breaks off, you get the fragment at 45.

Wait, for example, if the structure is cyclohexene with an ester substituent like O-CO-CH2CH3, then the ethyl group could break off. The fragment would be C2H5O, which is 45. So then, the molecule would have a cyclohexene ring, an ester group (O-CO-OEt?), but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's O-CO-CH2CH2-OH, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an ester where the R group is ethyl (CH2CH3). So, the molecule could be something like CH2CH2-O-CO-CH2CH2CH2OH. But that's seven carbons, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl group is part of a larger substituent on the ring.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a substituted cyclohexene with an ester side chain. For example, cyclohexene with an ester group where the R group is ethyl.

In that case, when the ester breaks, the ethyl group could form a fragment of C2H5O. That would fit the mass spec.

So, the structure would be something like cyclohexene with an ester substituent (O-CO-OEt), but I'm not sure about the exact structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a side chain attached to the cyclohexene ring. So, when the molecule fragments, the ethyl part (C2H5O) breaks off, giving the m/z=45 peak.

If that's the case, then the formula would be C6H10O2. The cyclohexene ring contributes 6 carbons, and the ethyl ester contributes 2 more (but wait, the ester would have more carbons). Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me try to summarize the findings so far.

The compound has:

- An -OH group (from the broad IR peak at 3000).

- A carbonyl group (from IR at 1700). Possibly an ester or ketone.

- A double bond (from the vinyl protons in NMR).

- A fragment at 45 in mass spec, likely C2H5O.

The options are A: C6H12O2 and C: C6H10O2.

The degrees of unsaturation for C are 2: so a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

The IR at 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring. But without a benzene ring (since the formula is C6H10O2, which would correspond to a substituted benzene with two substituents), perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: the IR at 1650 could be a C=C stretch in an aromatic ring. So perhaps the compound is an aromatic ester with a substituent. But the formula is C6H10O2. Benzene is C6H6, so substituents must account for 4 more H's. So perhaps two substituents, each adding two H's. For example, an ester group (-O-CO-O-R) and a hydroxyl group (-OH). Wait, but that would take up two substituents, each adding a certain number of H's.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group which adds two H's, and another substituent is a hydroxyl group which doesn't add any. So benzene would have two substituents: one ester (like O-CO-O-R) and one OH. The formula would then be C6H5-O-CO-O-R + OH. Wait, but that would add more carbons than allowed.

Hmm. Maybe the substituent is an ester group attached as O-CO-R, where R is a methyl group. Then the formula would be C6H5-O-CO-OCH3, which is C8H8O3. But our formula is C6H10O2, which is different.

I think I'm stuck on the structure. Let me try to focus on the mass spec fragment again. The fragment is 45, which is C2H5O. So the molecule must have a part that can lose C2H5O. For example, if the molecule is an ester R-O-CO-R', where R' is CH2CH3, then losing R' would leave R-O-CO. The mass of R' is 45. Wait, R' is CH2CH3, which has a molecular weight of 45? Let's see: CH2CH3 is C2H5, which is 2*12=24 +5=5=29. No, that's not 45. Hmm.

Wait, wait a second. If the fragment is C2H5O (45), and the ester group is O-CO-O-R, then R could be CH2CH2. So R is ethyl (CH2CH2CH3?), but wait, that's three carbons. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene group. Wait, ketene is R₂C=O. The mass of the fragment would be the mass of R₂C=O. If R is CH2CH2, then R₂C=O would be (CH2CH2)₂CO. Wait, that's 2*(12+2*1) + 12 + 16= 2*14 +28= 28 +28=56. No, that's higher than 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from the cleavage of a glycol ester. For example, a diol ester where one part breaks off.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a cyclic ester with a substituent that can break off. For example, a six-membered lactone with an ethyl group substituent. When the ethyl group breaks off, it would form a fragment of 45.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to make a decision.

Given that the IR has a broad peak (OH), a carbonyl (1700), and a possible C=C (1650), and the NMR has vinyl H, it's likely that the structure has an -OH, a carbonyl (like ester), and a double bond.

The fragment at 45 suggests a loss of C2H5O. So the molecule must have an ethyl group attached in a way that it can break off as C2H5O.

Putting this together, the formula with two O's that can have an ethyl group as a substituent and a carbonyl group is option C: C6H10O2.

So, the correct answer is option C: C6H10O2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The unknown compound is identified based on the provided spectroscopic data:

1. **FTIR Analysis**:  
   - A broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an -OH group.  
   - Strong absorption peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated system or a double bond.

2. **¹H NMR Analysis**:  
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens (protons on a double bond) indicate the presence of a double bond in the compound.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:  
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests the presence of a fragment with the molecular formula C₂H₅O. This fragment could result from the cleavage of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) attached to the molecule.

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂)**: This formula has a degree of unsaturation of 1, which could correspond to a ring or a double bond. However, it does not account for the observed vinyl hydrogens in the NMR, making it less likely.  
   - **Option B (C₆H₁₀O)**: This formula has a degree of unsaturation of 2, but it only contains one oxygen atom. Since the IR data indicates both a carbonyl group (C=O) and an -OH group, this option is invalid.  
   - **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**: This formula has a degree of unsaturation of 2, which can account for both a ring and a double bond. The two oxygen atoms fit the presence of a carbonyl group and an -OH group. The mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 aligns with the loss of a C₂H₅O group, which is consistent with this formula.  
   - **Option D (C₆H₁₂O)**: This formula has a degree of unsaturation of 1, which does not account for the observed vinyl hydrogens in the NMR. Additionally, it only has one oxygen atom, which is insufficient to explain the IR data.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The compound must have two oxygen atoms to satisfy the IR data, and the fragment at m/z = 45 suggests the presence of a C₂H₅O group. The formula C₆H₁₀O₂ (Option C) fits all the given data, including the presence of a carbonyl group, an -OH group, a double bond, and the observed mass spectrometry fragment.
