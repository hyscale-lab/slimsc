Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity making the star wobble. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is to the star, right?

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with similar mass to Neptune. Both orbits are circular. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method's signal depends on the mass of the planet and how close it is to the star. The formula I remember is something like the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star)^(1/3) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star))^(1/3) ) * (1/(period)^(1/3)) )? Or wait, maybe a simpler version: K = (v) is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1/(a)) * (some function of the orbital period). Hmm, maybe I should think about the formula for the RV semi-amplitude.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (P * (1 day))^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, the formula I remember is:

K = ( ( (27 * pi * G) / (c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (because Neptune's mass is much less than the Sun's, which is similar to the stars here), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So maybe it simplifies to K proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) / (P^(1/3)).

Wait, let me think again. The semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * P) / (2 * pi * c) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star, the denominator is approximately M_star^(2/3). So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) )

Wait, no, because P is the orbital period. Let me get that right. Alternatively, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * ( (1 - e²)^(0.5) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Assuming e is 0 (circular orbit), and M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K simplifies to:

K ≈ (2 pi G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Since both stars have the same mass (M_star is same for both), and the planets have similar masses (M_p is same for both), and sin i is the same (assuming i is same, but the question doesn't specify, but maybe the problem assumes sin i is same or 1, which is the maximum), then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So, K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

Which means P ∝ 1/(K^(3)).

Wait, let me see. If K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), then K = C / P^(1/3), where C is a constant. So P = (C/K)^3.

So, the period P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

So, for planet 1 and 2, their periods P1 and P2 are:

P1 ∝ (1/K1)^3

P2 ∝ (1/K2)^3

So the ratio P2/P1 would be ( (1/K2)^3 ) / ( (1/K1)^3 ) ) = (K1/K2)^3 * (1/1)^3 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, wait, let me recheck. If P is proportional to (1/K)^3, then P2/P1 = ( (1/K2) / (1/K1) )^3 ) = (K1/K2)^3.

So ratio P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, no. Wait, if P ∝ (1/K)^3, then P1 = k*(1/K1)^3, P2 = k*(1/K2)^3, where k is the same proportionality constant because M_star and M_p are same for both.

So P2/P1 = ( (1/K2)^3 ) / ( (1/K1)^3 ) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

So P2 is (K1/K2)^3 times P1. So the ratio P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, let me take an example. Suppose K1 is 5 and K2 is 7. So K1/K2 is 5/7. Then (5/7)^3 is about 125/343 ≈ 0.364. So P2 would be about 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1, but wait, the question says, "how many times longer is P2 than P1?" So if P2 is 0.364 * P1, that would mean P2 is shorter, so the answer would be approximately 0.36 times. So the ratio of P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again because sometimes these things are tricky. Because K is the semi-amplitude. A larger K corresponds to a larger velocity shift, which implies a larger mass or shorter period, right?

Wait, from the formula, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So higher K means smaller P. So if Planet #2 has a larger K (7 >5), its period should be smaller than Planet #1's period. So P2 is shorter than P1, so the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.36.

So that would mean the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's? It's shorter, so the answer is approximately 0.36 times, meaning 0.36 as long, so the ratio is 0.36. Therefore, the answer should be option A.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not messing the ratio. Let me think. The periods are inversely related to the cube of the K values. So, K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So P1 = K2^3 / K1^3? No, wait, no. Because P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

So, P1 = (1/K1)^3 * const.

P2 = (1/K2)^3 * const.

So the ratio P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

So P2 is (5/7)^3 times P1. Which is about (0.714)^3, which is approximately 0.364. So P2 is about 0.364 times P1, meaning it's about 0.36 times as long. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's shorter, so the factor is 0.36 times longer, which is option A.

So the answer should be A) ~0.36.

The radial velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude \( K \) of the RV signal is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), assuming the star's mass and the planet's mass are constant. Mathematically, \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \), which implies \( P \propto 1/K^3 \).

For Planet #1 and Planet #2, the RV semi-amplitudes are \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \), respectively. The ratio of their orbital periods \( P_2/P_1 \) can be expressed as:

\[
P_2/P_1 = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
P_2/P_1 = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \):

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
