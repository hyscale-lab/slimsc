Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me start by reading the question carefully and then breaking it down step by step.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, the first thing I need to do is probably normalize this state because it's given as proportional, which means it's not necessarily a unit vector yet.

Wait, right. To normalize, I should compute the inner product of the state with itself and then divide each component by the square root of that inner product. Let's write the state as |alpha> = A*( (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ), where A is the normalization constant. But wait, actually, the state is already written up to a proportionality constant, so I need to find A such that <alpha|alpha> = 1.

So, computing the inner product: <alpha|alpha> = |A|^2 [ (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) ] because |up> and |down> are orthonormal, so <up|down> = 0 and <up|up> = 1, same for down.

Calculating each term:

(1+i)(1-i) is (1)(1) + (1)(-i) + i(1) + i(-i) = 1 -i +i - (i^2). Since i^2 is -1, so 1 +1 = 2. So that term is 2.

Similarly, (2 - i)(2 + i) is (2)^2 + (2)(i) -i(2) -i^2 = 4 + 2i -2i +1 = 5. Because the middle terms cancel, and i^2 is -1, so adding 1.

So the total is |A|^2 (2 +5) = |A|^2 *7.

For normalization, this should equal 1, so |A| = 1/sqrt(7). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ].

Now, the first part of the problem is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator is given by Aij: Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, so what does this matrix look like? 

Assuming the basis is |up> and |down>, the matrix is 2x2. Let's index rows and columns as up and down. So:

A11 = 0 (since i=j=1, same row and column)
A12 = ħ/2 (i=1, j=2)
A21 = ħ/2 (i=2, j=1)
A22 =0.

So the matrix is:
[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0 ]

Wait, this looks familiar. I think this is the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So our matrix is (ħ/2) * X. So the operator is (ħ/2) σ_x.

The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively. But wait, since our operator is (ħ/2) σ_x, the eigenvalues would be (ħ/2)(1) and (ħ/2)(-1), so ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Wait, but the question is about the eigenstates of the operator. So the eigenstates are those two states I just mentioned. So to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate, we need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.

Let me denote the eigenstates as |+x> and |-x>, where |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Or maybe the other way around, but the exact labeling might not matter for the probabilities.

So the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>, all multiplied by 1/sqrt(7). Let me write |alpha> as (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> divided by sqrt(7).

I need to express this in terms of |+x> and |-x>. Let's write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me compute the coefficients c_+ and c_- such that |alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>.

Expressing |+x> and |-x> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = c_+ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c_- (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

= [ c_+ + c_- ] |up> / sqrt(2) + [ c_+ - c_- ] |down> / sqrt(2)

Compare this with the original |alpha> which is a |up> + b |down>, where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

So, equating coefficients:

a = [ c_+ + c_- ] / sqrt(2)
b = [ c_+ - c_- ] / sqrt(2)

To solve for c_+ and c_-, I can set up the equations:

c_+ + c_- = a * sqrt(2)
c_+ - c_- = b * sqrt(2)

Adding the two equations:

2 c_+ = (a + b) sqrt(2)
=> c_+ = (a + b) * sqrt(2)/2

Similarly, subtracting:

2 c_- = (a - b) sqrt(2)
=> c_- = (a - b) * sqrt(2)/2

Substituting a and b:

a = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)
b = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

So a + b = [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / sqrt(7) = (3) / sqrt(7)
a - b = [ (1 +i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(7)

So c_+ = (3/sqrt(7)) * sqrt(2)/2 = 3 sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) )

c_- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)/2 = ( (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) )/( 2 sqrt(7) )

The probabilities are the square of the magnitudes of c_+ and c_-. 

Compute |c_+|^2:

|c_+|^2 = [3^2 * 2 ] / [ (2^2)(7) ) ] = (9 * 2) / (4 *7) )= 18/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857...

Similarly, |c_-|^2:

First, compute numerator: (-1 + 2i) multiplied by sqrt(2). The magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) * 2 / [ (2^2)(7) ) ]

Wait, wait. Alternatively, |c_-|^2 = [ | (-1 + 2i) |^2 * (2) ] / [ (4 *7) ) ]

Because |c_-|^2 = [ ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) * (sqrt(2))^2 ] / [ (2 sqrt(7))^2 * (2^2) ) ] Wait, maybe I should compute it more directly.

Wait, |c_-| = | (-1 + 2i) | * sqrt(2) / ( 2 sqrt(7) )

The magnitude of (-1 + 2i): sqrt( (1)^2 + (2)^2 ) = sqrt(1+4)=sqrt(5)

So |c_-|= sqrt(5) * sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)) )= sqrt(10)/( 2 sqrt(7) )

So |c_-|^2 = (10)/(4*7) )= 10/(28) =5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, but wait, the probabilities should add up to 1, and 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1, which is correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.643 and 5/14≈0.357. Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which is close. But let me check the other parts as well.

Wait, but wait, am I sure about the direction? Because |alpha> is a combination of |up> and |down>, and the operator in question has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, so these are the states I'm projecting onto.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait another way: perhaps it's easier to compute the overlap. The probability of measuring the eigenstate |+x> is |< +x | alpha > |^2.

So compute < +x | alpha >.

|+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

So < +x | alpha > = [ ( < up | + < down | ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1 + i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) )

= [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

= [ (1+2) + (i -i) ) ] / sqrt(14) 

= 3 / sqrt(14)

So the probability is |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈0.6428.

Similarly, for |-x>, < -x | alpha > is [ < up | - < down | ] / sqrt(2) multiplied by the state.

So [ (1 + i) - (2 - i) ] / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

= [ (1-2) + (i +i) ] / sqrt(14)

= (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)

The magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) /14 = (1+4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.357.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.643) and 5/14 (~0.357).

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36. Hmm, but 5/14 is about 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded to two decimal places. So the first part of the answer is probabilities 9/14 and 5/14, which match option A's probabilities.

Wait, but looking at the options: option A says "0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7" for the average value. Let's compute the average value next.

The average value of the operator whose matrix is Aij. Since the operator is (ħ/2) σ_x, where σ_x has eigenvalues ±1, the operator's average is Tr( A rho ), where rho is the density matrix of |alpha>.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is an eigenstate of the original operator? Wait, no, |alpha> is a state in the computational basis, but the operator in question is (ħ/2) σ_x.

The average value is < alpha | A | alpha >, where A is the given operator.

Alternatively, let's compute the expectation value.

The operator A is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when applied to |up>, it gives (ħ/2)|down>, and to |down>, it gives (ħ/2)|up>.

But another way to compute the expectation value is to express |alpha> in the computational basis and compute the expectation value.

The state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7).

So to compute <A>, which is (ħ/2) σ_x, the expectation is (ħ/2) <sigma_x>.

Sigma_x's expectation value is ( <up| + <down| ) ( |up> + |down> ) ) / 2.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, compute <alpha| sigma_x | alpha>.

But since sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix, which swaps |up> and |down>, the expectation value is:

(alpha component conjugate) * (swapped component) summed.

More formally, <sigma_x> = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7) ] * (2 - i)/sqrt(7) + [ (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ] * (1 + i)/sqrt(7).

Because sigma_x |up> = |down>, so:

<sigma_x> = < alpha | sigma_x | alpha > 

= (1-i)(2 - i) + (2 + i)(1 + i) ) / 7.

Wait, let me compute this. Let's compute each term.

First term: (1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) -i*2 + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2.

i^2 is -1, so 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 + i)(1 + i) = 2*1 + 2*i +i*1 +i*i = 2 +2i +i +i^2.

Again, i^2 = -1, so 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

Adding both terms: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So <sigma_x> = 2 / 7? Wait, because (1 -3i + 1 +3i ) is 2, and denominator is 7.

Wait, but wait: 2 /7 is the expectation value of sigma_x. So the average of the operator A is (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Putting it all together: the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36 (exact 9/14 and 5/14), and the average is ħ/7. Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36 and ħ/7. So that's the correct option.

Wait, but wait. Let me check if I made a mistake in calculating the expectation value.

Wait, the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> all over sqrt(7).

The expectation value of sigma_x is given by:

<sigma_x> = [ (1+i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ] / 7.

Wait, wait no. Because sigma_x in matrix form is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So <sigma_x> = [ [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]* [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] + [ (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (1 +i)/sqrt(7) ] ]

Wait, because when you compute <sigma_x>, it's the sum over i,j of A_ij |a_i|^2, but wait no.

Wait, no, the expectation value is sum_{i,j} A_ij |<e_i | alpha>|^2 where e_i are the basis states. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think.

In general, for any operator O with matrix elements O_ij, the expectation value is sum_{i,j} O_ij <e_i|alpha> <alpha|e_j>.

Wait, since O is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], the matrix elements are O_11=0, O_12= ħ/2, O_21= ħ/2, O_22=0.

So the expectation value is O_12 <e_1|alpha> <alpha|e_2> + O_21 <e_2|alpha> <alpha|e_1>.

But O_12 and O_21 are both ħ/2.

<e_1|alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7), and <e_2|alpha> is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So <alpha|e_2> is the conjugate of (2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (2 +i)/sqrt(7).

So,

< A > = (ħ/2) [ <e_1|alpha> <alpha|e_2> + <e_2|alpha> <alpha|e_1> ]

= (ħ/2) [ (1+i)(2 +i) + (2 -i)(1 -i) ) ] / (7)

Wait, computing each term:

(1+i)(2+i) = 2 +i + 2i +i^2 = 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

(2 -i)(1 -i) = 2*1 + 2*(-i) -i*1 + (-i)(-i) = 2 -2i -i +i^2 = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Adding these two: (1+3i) + (1-3i) = 2.

So,

< A > = (ħ/2) * (2) /7 = (2 ħ) / (14) )= ħ/7.

Yes, that's correct. So the average is indeed ħ/7.

So the correct option is A: 0.64, 0.36 and ħ/7.

To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization constant \( A \) is determined by ensuring \( \langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = 1 \). Calculating the inner product:

\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = |A|^2 \left[ (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) \right].
\]

Expanding the terms:

\[
(1+i)(1-i) = 1 - i^2 = 1 + 1 = 2, \quad (2-i)(2+i) = 4 - i^2 = 4 + 1 = 5.
\]

Thus, \( \langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = |A|^2 (2 + 5) = 7|A|^2 \). For normalization, \( |A|^2 = 1/7 \), so \( A = 1/\sqrt{7} \). The normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

Next, the operator \( A \) is given with matrix elements \( A_{ij} = \hbar/2 \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. This corresponds to the operator \( A = (\hbar/2) \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( X \)-matrix:

\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \), with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in these eigenstates, we compute the overlaps \( \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \) and \( \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \).

1. **Probability of \( |+x\rangle \):**

\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow | + \langle \downarrow | \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ (1+i) + (2-i) \right] = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(+x) = |\langle +x | \alpha \rangle|^2 = \left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
\]

2. **Probability of \( |-x\rangle \):**

\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow | - \langle \downarrow | \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ (1+i) - (2-i) \right] = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(-x) = |\langle -x | \alpha \rangle|^2 = \left( \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{1 + 4}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Finally, the average value of the operator \( A \) is computed as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle.
\]

The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{7} \left[ (1-i)(2+i) + (2+i)(1-i) \right].
\]

Expanding:

\[
(1-i)(2+i) = 2 + i - 2i - i^2 = 2 - i + 1 = 3 - i, \quad (2+i)(1-i) = 2 - 2i + i - i^2 = 2 - i + 1 = 3 - i.
\]

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{1}{7} \left[ (3 - i) + (3 - i) \right] = \frac{6}{7}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{6}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively, and the average value of the operator is \( \hbar/7 \).
