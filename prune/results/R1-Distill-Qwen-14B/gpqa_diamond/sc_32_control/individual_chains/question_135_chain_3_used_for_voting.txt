Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically dealing with bosons and their decay products. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem gives me an interaction Lagrangian between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ_f fψ̄ f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think this means that the boson X is interacting with various fermions. The term suggests that X is a mediator, perhaps like a force carrier, but I'm not exactly sure which interaction it is. Well, regardless, the key point is about the decay products of X.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. So I need to figure out what fermions X can decay into based on their masses and the conservation laws.

Wait, kinematically allowed means that the energy and momentum should allow the decay to happen. The main thing here is that the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion it's decaying into. Because when a particle decays into two particles, each must have mass less than or equal to half the parent's mass. Oh right, because each daughter particle needs enough mass to exist, and the rest would be their kinetic energy.

So first, I need to list all possible fermions that X can decay into. Let's list the possible fermions and their masses.

Fermions include quarks and leptons. Wait, the fermions in the options involve quarks (like b, c, s, u, d) and charged leptons (like tau, mu, electron) plus their antiparticles.

But wait, the problem says the interaction is with fermions f. So looking at the Lagrangian, the interaction term is proportional to fψ̄ (v + X) ψ_f. Oh, that notation is a bit confusing. Wait, the term looks like λ f (ψ_f)† (v + X) ψ_f. So ψ_f represents a fermion field, and f is maybe a flavor index or something. So X is interacting with fermions of various types.

But perhaps the actual key is that X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because the mass of X is 6 GeV, so 2m_fermion ≤ 6 GeV, so m_fermion ≤ 3 GeV.

So let's list the masses of the fermions:

Electron (e): mass is about 0.0005 GeV. So way below 3 GeV. So e+ e- pair is allowed.

Similarly, muon (mu): mass ~0.105 GeV. Also allowed.

Tau (tau): mass ~1.78 GeV. So 2*1.78 = 3.56 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV? Wait, no. Wait, X is 6 GeV, so 2*m_tau is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6. So tau pair is allowed.

Quarks: for the up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top.

Up (u): mass is about 2 MeV, so negligible, definitely allowed.

Down (d): similar to u, mass about 3-5 MeV, so allowed.

Strange (s): mass around 95-100 MeV, about 0.1 GeV. So 2m_s is about 0.2 GeV, way less than 6 GeV.

Charm (c): mass around 1.2-1.5 GeV. So 2m_c is about 2.4-3 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So c and cbar can be decay products.

Bottom (b): mass around 4.1-4.7 GeV. So 2m_b is about 8.2-9.4 GeV. Wait, but X is 6 GeV, so 2m_b is about 9 GeV, which is larger than X's mass. So X can't decay into b and bbar because that would require the X's mass to be at least 8.2 GeV. So b is out.

Top quark (t): way heavier, about 173 GeV. So definitely not allowed.

So which quarks can X decay into? u, d, s, c. But wait, what about the strange quark? Yes, s is allowed. But I thought the decay into s sbar is possible.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but from above, b is too heavy. So A includes b which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So c is allowed (mass ~1.5 GeV, 2m ~3 GeV <=6 GeV). So B includes c, which is correct. But B doesn't include b, which is correct. But in the options, B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, but what about the tau? Earlier, I thought that 2m_tau is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau can be a decay product.

So X can decay into tau+ tau-? Yes, because 2m_tau is 3.56 GeV < 6 GeV.

Then, the allowed fermions for decay are: e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

But wait, the options don't include option C or D. Let me look again.

Option C: X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

But t is too heavy, so option C is incorrect because it includes t.

Option D: X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

But b is too heavy, so D is incorrect.

So looking back, the correct options would include c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So the only option that includes all these is option B, right? Let me check.

Option B includes c cbar, so that's correct. It includes s sbar, u, d, tau, mu, e. So yes, all the allowed fermions.

Wait, but wait a second. Do the decay products also need to have a charge that matches the boson's? Well, the boson X is neutral? The Lagrangian term doesn't specify charge because it's a neutral current interaction? Or is X charged?

Wait, the interaction term is λ f f-bar (v + X). So X must be a neutral boson because the fermion fields are in the same term as X. Because in the term, it's ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f (y), so X must be a neutral field because it's sandwiched between two fermion fields. So X is neutral. Therefore, when it decays, it must decay into a fermion and its antifermion, which are each charged, but the sum of their charges is zero. So in this case, the decay products would be a pair of charged leptons or quarks.

But the mass is 6 GeV, so the allowed fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c. Because their masses are all below 3 GeV. Wait, wait, but wait, the tau is ~1.78 GeV, so 2*1.78 is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau can be produced.

So in the options, which include all these fermions? Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's all correct.

Wait, but let me make sure that the interaction allows decay into all these fermions. The Lagrangian given is for the interaction with fermions f. So the term is -λ_f f ψ_f† (v + X) ψ_f. So this suggests that X can interact with any of the fermions f. So X can decay into any of the allowed fermions as long as their mass is low enough.

So the possible decay channels for X are into any fermion-antifermion pair where the total mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

So the possible decay products are:

- e+ e- (allowed)

- mu+ mu- (allowed)

- tau+ tau- (allowed)

- u ubar (allowed)

- d dbar (allowed)

- s sbar (allowed)

- c cbar (allowed)

But wait, top quark is too heavy, as discussed earlier.

So the decay products must include all of the above except for b. The options are:

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

Yes, that's correct. So the allowed decay modes are all those in option B.

Wait, but looking again, option B is listed as:

c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, all allowed. So option B is the correct one.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian provided indicates that \( X \) interacts with fermions \( f \), and the decays must satisfy the condition that the total mass of the decay products is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \). Specifically, for a decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, \( 2m_f \leq m_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion and \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 1: Analyze the allowed fermion masses
The fermion masses are as follows:
- Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_e \approx 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_u \approx 4 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 3-5 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_d \approx 6-10 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 95-100 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_s \approx 190-200 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.2-1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \approx 2.4-3 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.1-4.7 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \approx 8.2-9.4 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 2m_b > m_X \)).
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( m_t \gg m_X \)).

Thus, the allowed fermions for decay are \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \).

### Step 2: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > m_X \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \). All these fermions satisfy \( 2m_f \leq m_X \), so this option is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( m_t \gg m_X \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > m_X \). Hence, this option is incorrect.

### Final Answer
The correct option is **B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decay products of \( X \) at the lowest order.

**Answer: B**
