Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. Let's see.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is that product reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A to D, each suggesting what A and B are.

Wait, wait. Let me look again. Oh, in the second reaction, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Hmm, so that's a nitrile with some substituents. And it's reacting with B (which I think is an acid, perhaps H2O under acidic conditions) to form a carboxylic acid.

So breaking it down step by step.

First reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Butan-2-one is a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it's typically a nucleophilic addition. But wait, ketones can undergo addition reactions with nucleophiles like CN-.

Wait, but in the product, I see a hydroxyl group (OH) and a nitrile (CN) group. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Structure-wise, that would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, but butanenitrile is four carbons in the chain. Wait, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH(CH2CN)(OH)CH2CH3? Or perhaps I got the structure wrong. Let me think. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, no, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait no, butane is four carbons, so butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, no, butyronitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, which is three carbons plus the nitrile. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the product.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the main chain is four carbons (butane), with a hydroxyl and a methyl group on the same carbon (position 2), and a nitrile at the end.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, perhaps it's a substitution or addition. Oh wait, for ketones, the reaction with CN- is likely an addition. Let's think about it.

The reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN → product. The product has a hydroxyl group where the carbonyl was? Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. If we add CN- to the carbonyl, that would form a cyanohydrin. Oh right! That's a thing. Cyanohydrin formation. So when a ketone reacts with CN- in an aqueous acidic environment, it forms a cyanohydrin. The mechanism is the attack of the nucleophilic cyanide ion on the carbonyl carbon, followed by protonation and then water adding to form the hydroxyl group.

So the product would have the structure (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product would have the same structure but with O replaced by OH and a CN group attached? Let me draw this.

The starting material: O=C(CH2CH3) ? No wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH3.

Adding CN-: the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, adding to it, then the oxygen becomes an alkoxide, which then picks up a proton. But in the presence of acid, perhaps.

Wait, but in the product, it's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons.

Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. But substituting for butane, the nitrile is at the end. The product I'm thinking of would have (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Wait, but that's five carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, that's (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile? No, because the main chain would be three carbons (propanenitrile). Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the product's name.

2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile: the main chain is four carbons (butanenitrile). The hydroxyl and methyl are on C2. So structure would be CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN? No, because butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, but that's only four carbons with the nitrile on C4. So the structure would be:

CH2-CH(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN? Wait, but that has four carbons in the main chain. Wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, so the nitrile is on C4. So the product would have a hydroxyl and methyl on C2, and the nitrile on C4.

Wait, the structure would be CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN. So that's four carbons in the main chain, with substituents on C2 and the nitrile on C4.

So how does that form from butan-2-one? Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. To get the nitrile on C4, perhaps the starting material is different. Oh wait, perhaps the initial product is a cyanohydrin, which is then further reacting under certain conditions.

Wait but the question is about the reagents. So for the first reaction, butan-2-one reacts with NaCN in the presence of reagent A to form the cyanohydrin. So reagent A is likely an acid because the cyanohydrin formation typically occurs under acidic conditions.

So for the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+ (proton source), because the cyanide ion would deprotonate water in the presence of an acid. Alternatively, perhaps A is something else, like H2SO4 or another acid.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B=HCl.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH.

Wait, so for the first reaction, A must be acidic. So options A and B have H3O+ as A. Options C and D have NaHSO3. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is a substitution. Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone, so substitution isn't straightforward. It's more likely addition.

So in the first step, the reagent A is an acid, like H3O+, to protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic, allowing CN- to attack.

So first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN in H3O+ → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Now, moving to the second reaction. The product from the first step is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Wait, actually, the second reaction's starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Wait, maybe I'm getting the substituents right, but perhaps the main chain is longer.

In any case, the second reaction is treating this compound with reagent B (H2O) to form a carboxylic acid. So 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + H2O (with B) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, so the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen? Nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. Typically, strong acidic or basic conditions with heat.

Wait, but in the presence of water and an acid catalyst, perhaps. So the nitrile group would undergo hydrolysis. Alternatively, perhaps B is an acid catalyst, like HCl or something else.

Wait, nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylic acids usually under strong acidic conditions. Alternatively, in the presence of H2O and an acid. For example, using HCl as a catalyst. Or perhaps using H2SO4 as a catalyst.

Alternatively, hydrolysis of nitriles can be done in two steps: first to the amide, then to the acid. But in this case, the product is directly the acid, so perhaps it's a strong acidic hydrolysis.

Wait, but the question says that reagent B is H2O. So perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction, but under what conditions?

Wait, so the starting material for the second reaction is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. When you hydrolyze the nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH), you have to consider the conditions. The presence of a hydroxyl group on the same carbon might influence the reaction.

Wait, but when a nitrile is adjacent to a hydroxyl group, perhaps the hydrolysis is more straightforward. Or maybe it's an example of a Hofmann or Curtius type reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the nitrile is in the butanenitrile part. So converting the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. The product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So that's the same carbon chain but with the CN becoming COOH.

So, the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid. What's the typical reagent for that?

Nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid typically uses strong acid and heat, like HCl with H2O and heat. Or H2SO4 with H2O and heat. Alternatively, in some cases, using a base like NaOH and H2O under reflux.

Wait, but in the options, for B, the possible reagents are HCl and CH3COOH. So perhaps B is HCl.

Wait, but the second reaction says reagent B is H2O. So maybe the reagent is H2O in the presence of an acid catalyst, like HCl.

So for the second reaction, reagent B is HCl. Or perhaps it's H2O with HCl as a catalyst.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: B = HCl.

Option B: B = CH3COOH.

So, if in the second reaction, the nitrile group is converted to a carboxylic acid under acidic conditions, then B is HCl.

So, putting it together, for the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+ because it's the acid needed for the cyanohydrin formation.

For the second reaction, reagent B is HCl because it's the acid catalyst for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, this would correspond to option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

But wait, let me double-check.

Option A: A= H3O+, B= HCl.

Yes, that fits. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but wait another thought. In the first reaction, when forming the cyanohydrin, the reagent A is H3O+ (proton source, like HCl or H2SO4). So in the options, A can be H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, what's the role of NaHSO3? It's a source of H+ and SO3^2-? Or perhaps for something else.

Wait, another possibility: could the first reaction involve a different mechanism? Like a substitution instead of addition. But with ketones, substitution is not typical. So it's more likely the addition (cyanohydrin) reaction.

So, for the first reaction, acid is needed. So reagent A is H3O+.

So in the options, the correct pair would be A = H3O+ (so options A or B), and B = HCl (so option A).

Thus, option A is correct.

The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. Cyanohydrin formation typically occurs under acidic conditions, where the acid protonates the carbonyl group, making it more electrophilic, and facilitates the nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, reagent A must be an acid, and H₃O⁺ is a suitable choice for this reaction.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to form a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This transformation typically requires an acid catalyst, such as HCl, to facilitate the hydrolysis of the nitrile group under aqueous conditions.

From the options, the combination where A = H₃O⁺ (to facilitate cyanohydrin formation in the first reaction) and B = HCl (to catalyze the hydrolysis of the nitrile group in the second reaction) is consistent with the required mechanisms.

Answer: A
