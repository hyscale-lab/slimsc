Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a researcher trying to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're using a construct where the gene is modified to include a sequence for the hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells with this plasmid, using Lipofectamine, and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies to test expression. But they can't overexpress the protein as expected.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, I need to figure out why the protein isn't overexpressing. The options are A to D.

Hmm, so the construct adds the HA tag at the beginning. The problem is probably in the construct's design leading to no protein expression.

Looking at the plus strand sequence: starts with ATG, which is the start codon, methionine. Then the next codon is TAC, which is tyrosine. Wait, the HA tag is a specific sequence. Let me recall the HA epitope. I think it's derived from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus, and the common HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. But wait, the question says the sequence was introduced for the HA antigenic determinant at the N-terminus. So the construct should start with the HA tag followed by the GADD45G coding sequence.

But in the given sequence, the start is ATG, which is methionine. So perhaps the HA sequence isn't correctly added or the reading frame is messed up.

Wait, maybe the HA tag is added as a sequence before the ATG start. Let me think about how tags are added. If the plasmid was constructed by inserting the HA tag into the N-terminus, the construct should have the HA sequence followed by a start codon and the GADD45G coding sequence.

But looking at the provided DNA, the first part is ATG, so that's the start codon. That suggests that the HA tag isn't present in the correct frame or perhaps the construct is missing the HA tag entirely.

Wait, in the question, the researcher introduced a sequence for a single HA determinant at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. So the HA should be at the beginning, before the start codon.

But looking at the plus strand sequence provided, the first codon is ATG (methionine). So that suggests that the HA tag wasn't added correctly. Maybe the HA tag was inserted in the wrong reading frame, leading to a frameshift and a premature stop codon, or perhaps the HA tag isn't present at all.

Wait, another thought: the HA tag is added as a fusion to the N-terminus. So the construct should have the HA coding sequence followed by the ATG start codon for GADD45G. But in the given sequence, the first codon is ATG, which is the start of the GADD45G. So either the HA wasn't included, or it's in the wrong frame.

But the HA tag is a stretch of amino acids, so the DNA sequence would be a specific sequence before the ATG. If the HA isn't there, then the coding sequence starts with ATG and proceeds. Wait, but the problem is that the researcher intended to have the HA tag, so perhaps the construct is wrong. If the HA isn't present, then the translated protein would lack the HA tag, but why would that prevent overexpression? Because the HA is for affinity purification, but the question says the protein isn't overexpressed. So maybe the construct is faulty in another way.

Wait, perhaps the sequence after the ATG is messed up. Let me look for possible stop codons or other issues.

Looking at the DNA sequence starting from ATG:

ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG A G... Wait, let's break it into triplets:

1. ATG (start)
2. TAC (tyrosine)
3. CCC (proline)
4. ATA (isoleucine)
5. CGA (arginine)
6. TGT (cysteine)
7. TCC (serine)
8. AGA (arginine)
9. TTA (leucine)
10. CGC (alanine)
11. CAA (glutamine)
12. ATG (start again? That's a problem)

Wait, hold on. The next codon after CAA is ATG, which is another start codon. So that's a second ATG in the same reading frame. That's an issue. Because the ribosome might terminate after the first ATG and the following codons, but wait, the ribosome starts at the first ATG and continues until a stop codon. So this second ATG would be in the middle of the coding sequence. But wait, in the same frame, the second ATG is at position 12. So the first part is:

pos1-3: ATG (Met)
pos4-6: TAC (Tyr)
pos7-9: CCC (Pro)
pos10-12: ATA (Ile)
pos13-15: CGA (Arg)
pos16-18: TGT (Cys)
pos19-21: TCC (Ser)
pos22-24: AGA (Arg)
pos25-27: TTA (Leu)
pos28-30: CGC (Ala)
pos31-33: CAA (Gln)
pos34-36: ATG (Met)

So from position 34-36, another ATG. So the ribosome would read until a stop codon, but here, the second ATG is in the middle. But wait, the first ATG is the start, then the ribosome continues until it hits a stop codon. So in this case, the second ATG would be just another amino acid (Met) in the middle. So why would that cause a problem? Because it's in the same frame, so it's part of the protein. Unless this Met is followed by a stop codon, but looking further:

After ATG (position 34-36), the next codon is TAC (Tyr) at 37-39, then CCA (Pro) 40-42, etc. So it's part of the coding sequence. Hmm. But why would that prevent overexpression? Because maybe the construct has another issue.

Another possibility is that the HA tag wasn't included at all. Since the sequence starts with ATG, perhaps the HA wasn't inserted, leading to the GADD45G being expressed without the HA tag. But the researcher wanted the HA tag for affinity purification. However, the lack of the HA tag wouldn't necessarily prevent the GADD45G from being expressed; it would just not bind to the HA antibody. But the question says that the protein isn't overexpressed. So perhaps the HA tag, when added, caused a problem.

Wait, but in the given sequence, the HA isn't present, because the first codon is ATG for GADD45G. So the construct didn't include the HA tag. But the researcher intended to add it. So that's a problem. But why would that prevent overexpression? It's possible that the HA tag was supposed to be added, but due to a cloning mistake, it's not there, and perhaps the GADD45G is not expressed properly. Alternatively, perhaps the HA was inserted in the wrong frame, causing a frameshift.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the HA tag was not inserted, leading the GADD45G to be expressed without the tag, but that doesn't directly explain why the protein isn't being overexpressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag was inserted in such a way that it introduced a stop codon before the GADD45G sequence. For example, if the HA tag was inserted into a different reading frame, it could have introduced a stop codon, but the given sequence starts with ATG, so maybe the HA was inserted before the ATG but in the wrong frame, causing a stop codon. Wait, but the given sequence starts with ATG, so the HA might not have been inserted correctly.

But the question states that the construct was introduced with the HA at the N-terminus. So the problem must be in the construct's sequence.

Wait, looking again, the start is ATG. So if the HA was supposed to be before that, then perhaps the construct has a missing HA sequence. But then, why is the researcher unable to overexpress the GADD45G protein? Because the HA tag is for affinity purification, but maybe the lack of the HA tag isn't the problem for expression. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Another angle: the construct has a premature stop codon. Let me scan the sequence for TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Looking through the DNA sequence:

Looking from the start:

ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC ... Wait, let me scan for the stop codons.

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA in the DNA (on the plus strand, so complementary on the mRNA). Remember that stop codons on mRNA are UAA, UAG, UGA.

So in the DNA, the complementary would be ATT (for UAA), ATG (for TAG), or TCT (for UGA). Wait, no. Wait, mRNA is synthesized from the DNA template (minus strand). So the plus strand's DNA translates directly into mRNA except T becomes U. So to find stop codons in the mRNA, look for TAA (mRNA UAA) in the DNA (but wait, the DNA has T, so the mRNA would be U), so looking for TAA, TAG, or TGA in the DNA sequence.

Wait, let me clarify. The mRNA is synthesized from the template (minus) strand, which is complementary to the plus strand. So the plus strand's sequence is what's given. So to get the mRNA sequence, we take the plus strand and replace T with U. So the mRNA would have the same sequence except T becomes U.

So in the DNA sequence, any occurrence of TAA (on the plus strand) would become UAA on the mRNA, which is a stop codon.

Looking through the DNA sequence:

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA.

Looking:

After the start ATG, let's see:

Looking for triplets:

- TAC → mRNA is UAC (no stop)
- CCC → CCC (no)
- ATA → ATA → UTA (no)
- CGA → CGA (no)
- TGT → TGT → UGT (no)
- TCC → TCC → UCC (no)
- AGA → AGA → UGA → which is a stop codon! Wait, AGA in DNA is AGA on the mRNA (since DNA is plus strand), which is AGA. Wait, wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, in the DNA plus strand, the sequence is ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA ... So the mRNA would be AUG UA C C C ... etc. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: if the DNA plus strand is ATG TAC ..., the mRNA is AUG UA C ..., so the mRNA starts with AUG (start codon). Then the next codon is UAC (Tyr), then CCC (Pro), etc.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me just look for the stop codons in the DNA.

Looking for any TAA, TAG, or TGA in the DNA.

Looking at the sequence:

Let me go through the DNA in triplets:

1. ATG → no
2. TAC → no
3. CCC → no
4. ATA → no
5. CGA → no
6. TGT → no
7. TCC → no
8. AGA → AGA → which is a codon for arginine in DNA, but on mRNA, it would be UGA, which is a stop codon.

Ah! So at position 8-10, the DNA has AGA, which on mRNA would be UGA, a stop codon. So the mRNA would have UGA at that point, causing the ribosome to terminate translation early.

Wait, let me count the positions:

The DNA sequence starts with 5' ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC ... etc.

So the first codon is ATG (1-3), then TAC (4-6), then CCC (7-9), then ATA (10-12), CGA (13-15), TGT (16-18), TCC (19-21), AGA (22-24). So the 8th codon is AGA at positions 22-24.

So in the mRNA, which is the DNA plus strand with T→U, the codon would be UGA. UGA is a stop codon. So the mRNA would have a stop codon at this position, leading to premature termination of translation.

So the construct's coding sequence includes a premature stop codon (UGA), which would cause the ribosome to terminate early, leading to a truncated protein, or no protein if the stop is in the middle.

Wait, but why is this happening? The researcher added the HA tag, but perhaps during cloning, the reading frame was messed up, leading to an extra stop codon.

So the issue is that the construct has a stop codon in the middle, causing early termination.

Looking at the options:

Option B says "The ribosome terminated the translation early." That would explain the lack of overexpression. Because the mRNA has a premature stop codon, the protein is not made fully, or not at all beyond that point.

Alternatively, Option A: the HA sequence has a missense mutation. But from the given DNA, the HA isn't present because the sequence starts with ATG. So that's probably not the case.

Option C: lack of linker causing proteolysis. Maybe, but the HA tag is for purification, and without it, the protein may not be purified, but the question says the overexpression isn't happening, implying the protein isn't made.

Option D: tRNA for UAA doesn't exist. But UAA is a stop codon; all ribosomes recognize it, so that's not the issue.

So the problem seems to be the premature stop codon in the mRNA, causing early termination.

Which option matches this? Option B says the ribosome terminated early. Yes, because the mRNA has a UGA (from DNA AGA) as a stop codon in the middle of the coding sequence.

The question involves a researcher attempting to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The researcher introduced a sequence for the hemagglutinin (HA) antigenic determinant at the N-terminus of the GADD45G coding sequence. However, the protein is not being overexpressed as expected. The provided DNA sequence of the plus strand reveals that the coding sequence starts with ATG (the start codon) and proceeds with other codons. Upon closer inspection, a premature stop codon is identified in the sequence.

The DNA sequence contains the triplet AGA at positions 22–24, which translates to UGA on the mRNA. UGA is a stop codon, causing the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely. This premature termination prevents the full-length protein from being expressed, leading to the observed lack of overexpression.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. This is incorrect because the HA tag is not present in the sequence; the sequence starts directly with ATG for GADD45G.
- **Option B**: The ribosome terminated the translation early. This is correct because the mRNA contains a premature stop codon (UGA), leading to early termination of translation.
- **Option C**: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain. This is incorrect because the issue is with translation termination, not proteolysis.
- **Option D**: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse. This is incorrect because UGA (the stop codon) is universally recognized by ribosomes, and its recognition does not depend on specific tRNAs.

The correct explanation is that the premature stop codon in the mRNA causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the full-length protein from being expressed.
