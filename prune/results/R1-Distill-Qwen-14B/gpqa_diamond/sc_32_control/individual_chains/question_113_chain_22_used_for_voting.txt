Okay, let's try to figure out the structure of this unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Hmm, so the question gives me FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spec data. I'll need to use each of these clues one by one to narrow down the possibilities.

Starting with the FTIR. The broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 is probably an O-H stretch, like from an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids usually have a very broad peak, often around 2500-3300. Alternatively, an alcohol's O-H is broad too. Also, the strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Those are in the range of carbonyl groups (C=O). 1700 is typical for a ketone or maybe an ester, and 1650 could be conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, perhaps an ester or a ketone with adjacent double bonds.

Wait, another thought: 1700 and 1650 might indicate two different carbonyl groups. Maybe like an ester (which is around 1700-1750) and a conjugated carbonyl, say from an aromatic ring, like a conjugated ketone or maybe a carbonyl in a ring. Alternatively, maybe a carbonyl and an aromatic ring with conjugation, but I'm not too sure.

But wait, the NMR says there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl refers to CH2 groups adjacent to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the molecule must have a double bond. That might tie into the IR peaks. For instance, a conjugated carbonyl and a double bond adjacent to it would give a lower wavenumber for the carbonyl, like around 1650. So perhaps the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl group, maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester.

Looking at the options now:

Options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

So all of these have oxygen, which makes sense with the IR peaks.

Next, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens. So perhaps there's an alkene in the molecule. That would fit with a conjugated system, like an ester with a double bond nearby.

Now the mass spectrum: a fragment peak at m/z=45. What fragments are possible? 45 could be a carbonyl group plus something. Wait, 45 is CH3OCH2? No, that's 45? Let me calculate. 45 is C2H5O? Wait, molecular weight: carbon is 12, hydrogen is 1, oxygen is 16. So 45: if it's CH3OCH2, that's (12*2)+(5)+(16) = 24+5+16=45. Hmm, perhaps that's a fragment. Alternatively, another possibility: maybe a CH3CO group? No, the mass of CH3CO is 43 (12*2 +3 +16= 43). Wait, but 45. So maybe a CH3COCH2? No, that's 59. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula. Let's think about the possible options.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: Each degree is a ring or double bond. For C6H12O2, the formula is C6H12O2. The general formula for an alkane is CnH2n+2O. So for C6H14O2, that would be fully saturated. But this is C6H12O2, which is 2 H less. So 2 degrees of unsaturation. That could be two double bonds, one double bond and a ring, or two rings. But with the NMR showing vinyl hydrogens, at least one double bond. So maybe one double bond and one ring, or two double bonds.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation: For C6H12O, it's 2n+2 = 14, so 14-10=4; 4/2=2. So two degrees. But wait, the formula is C6H10O. So the general formula is CnH2nO. For n=6, 2n=12. So 12-10=2, which is 2 H less. So 2 degrees of unsaturation. So again, could be a double bond and a ring.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: For C6H12O2, it's 2n+2=14. So 14-10=4; 4/2=2. So two degrees. So that's either a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, or two rings.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees of unsaturation: 2n+2=14, 14-12=2. So 1 degree, which could be a ring or a double bond.

But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. So options that have at least one double bond.

Looking again: all options except perhaps D have at least two degrees of unsaturation, which could include a double bond.

Wait, option D is C6H12O. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree. That could be a double bond or a ring. But with the NMR showing vinyl H, it's more likely that it has a double bond, but let's think.

So the mass spec shows a fragment at m/z=45. What could that be? Let's think about possible fragments for each formula.

For option A: C6H12O2. Possible fragments: a fragment with a molecular weight of 45. Let's see, 45 could be, for example, (CH3CO)O- but that's 43. Or maybe CH2(O) something. Alternatively, maybe a cleavage product. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is an ester. For example, if the molecule is an ester with a methoxy group, like methyl something ester.

But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, so an ester has two carbonyl groups? No, esters have a carbonyl. Wait, wait, the IR shows two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. So perhaps two carbonyl groups. So maybe it's an anhydride? Or maybe a conjugated system with two carbonyls.

Wait, another thought: the IR peaks could be an ester (around 1700) and a conjugated carbonyl, like a ketone adjacent to a double bond, which would lower the wavenumber, so around 1650. So perhaps the molecule is something like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

If the molecule is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, then the structure could be something like CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is an alkyl group. For example, methyl acrylate would be CH2=CHCOOCH3. Let's see the molecular formula for that: C4H6O2. But our options are C6H12O2, etc. So maybe a longer chain.

Wait, our options are larger molecules. For example, maybe a six-membered ring ester with a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, but that's less likely given the IR peaks.

Wait, another approach: the mass spec. The fragment at m/z=45. If the molecular formula is C6H12O2, then what's the molecular weight? 6*12=72, 12*1=12, 2*16=32. 72+12+32=116. So molecular weight is 116. So the fragment at 45 is about 40% of that. Maybe it's a cleavage product.

What if the molecule is an ester, like R-O-CO-R'. For example, methyl something ester. Let's think: if the ester is part of the molecule, then the ester group is O-C-O. When the ester breaks, perhaps it would lose a fragment. If the ester is cleaved, the fragments could be R-O- and COOR'. For example, if the R is a methyl group, then the fragment could be CH3-O, which is 31 (12+16+1?), but no, that's 31. Wait, but 45 is higher than that. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is (CH2)nO with some carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketone. For example, if the molecule has a ketone group, then a fragment could be CH3CO, which is 43. But the fragment is at 45. Hmm, maybe a different group.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be a CH2CH2O group? No, that's too light. Alternatively, the fragment could be something like CH2=CH-O. Wait, the molecular weight of CH2=CH-O would be 12*2+4+16=44, which is close but not 45. Oh, but wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-O plus a methyl group. No, that would be higher.

Alternatively, maybe a fragment like CH2CH2OCH3. But that's 49. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another thought: 45 could correspond to a methyl ester group. Let's see, the methyl ester would be OCOCH3. The molecular weight of that is 12 (O) +12 (CO) +16*2 (O) +12 (CH3) +3 (H3) = Wait, no, wait: O is 16, C=12, O=16. So OCOCH3 is O (16) + C (12) + O (16) + CH3 (15). Wait, no. O-C-O is 16+12+16=44, plus CH3 is 15 (12+3*1). So 44+15=59. Hmm, that's higher than 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is CH3CO- group, which is 43. But the peak is at 45. Maybe it's a CH3COCH2- group. That would be 43 +15=58, which is higher. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is an ethyl group with some oxygen. Ethyl is 29. Hmm, but 45 is higher.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is HCO-OCH2CH3. No, that's higher.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketone group. Like, say, acetone (CH3COCH3). Its molecular weight is (2*12) + (6*1) + (3*16) = 24 +6 +48=78. No, that's higher. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the molecular formula and what kind of fragments could produce 45. Let's think about the possible molecular formulas.

If the molecular formula is C6H12O2, which has a molecular weight of 116, then the fragments could be something like C3H7O, which would be 3*12 +7 +16=36+7+16=59. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is C2H5O, which is 45? Let's calculate. C2H5O: 2*12=24, 5*1=5, 16=16. 24+5+16=45. Oh! So the fragment is C2H5O. So that's an ethyl group with an oxygen attached. So maybe a CH2CH2O- group.

So in the molecule, perhaps there's an ester group. Let's say the ester is something like O-CO-O-R, but how would that fragment into C2H5O? Alternatively, maybe the molecule is an ester with an ethyl group attached.

Wait, the ester functional group is O-CO-O. If the ester is part of the molecule, perhaps during fragmentation, the ester could break into two parts. For example, cleavage between the oxygen and the carbonyl, giving an alkoxide and a carbonyl fragment.

So, for example, suppose the molecule is ethyl something ester. Then, upon fragmentation, it might lose the ethyl group as a fragment (C2H5O-) with a charge. But wait, the fragment is at 45, which would be C2H5O as I calculated: 24+5+16=45.

So if the molecule is an ester with an ethyl group, then the fragment would be the ethyl group plus an oxygen. So that would fit. Let's see which options have an ethyl group.

Looking at the options, the possible formulas: let's check for options that contain an O in a way that could form such a fragment.

Option A: C6H12O2. If the ester is, say, ethyl propionate (but that's C5H10O2), but our formula is C6H12O2. Wait, maybe a longer chain.

If the ester is ethyl something, then the formula of the ester would be (RCOOCH2CH3). The molecular formula for that would be RCOOCH2CH3: so the R would be C4H7O. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is a cyclic ester, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a diester or something else.

Wait, another angle: the IR has peaks at 1700 and 1650, which suggests two carbonyl groups. So perhaps it's an anhydride? But anhydrides usually have a higher wavenumber for the carbonyl, around 1800-something. So maybe not.

Alternatively, is there a possibility of two conjugated carbonyl groups? Like in a diketone? Or perhaps a molecule with two ester groups? Hmm, that's a stretch.

Wait, another possibility: the 1700 and 1650 could be from an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, but that doesn't directly explain the two peaks. Alternatively, perhaps one is an ester and the other is a conjugated ketone.

But the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so an alkene is present. So perhaps the molecule has an ester group and a conjugated double bond.

Putting that together, maybe the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOR, where R is an ethyl group. Let's calculate the formula. CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3: that's C5H8O2. But our options have C6H12O2, which is C6H12O2. So that's one more carbon and four more hydrogens.

Wait, perhaps the R group is a propyl group. CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. That would be C6H10O2. Which is option C. Hmm, but the molecular formula in option C is C6H10O2, which has two degrees of unsaturation. Wait, for C6H10O2, the degrees of unsaturation are (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. One from the double bond (CH2=CHCOO-) and one from the ester group (the carbonyl). So that fits.

But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which would be the CH2=CH part. So that makes sense.

Now, the mass spec fragment of 45 could correspond to the ethyl group (C2H5O), as we thought earlier. So in the ester, the ethyl group would be a fragment. So if the ester is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3, then upon fragmentation, losing the ethyl group would give a fragment of C2H5O (45).

So, the formula would be C5H8O2 (if the main chain is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3). Wait, no, counting the carbons: CH2=CH is 2 C, COO is 2 C, and CH2CH3 is 2 C. So 2+2+2=6 C. Wait, no:

Wait, CH2=CH is 2 C, COO is 2 C, then CH2CH3 is 2 C. So total 6 C (2 + 2 + 2). So the formula would be C6H10O2. Which matches option C.

But wait, wait, the molecular formula for CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 is C5H8O2? Let me recount. CH2=CHCOO- is C3H4O2, and the ethyl group is C2H5. So 3+2=5 C, 4+5=9 H, plus the O2. So formula would be C5H9O2? No, wait:

Wait, CH2=CHCOO- is:

CH2=CH-CO-O-: that's 3 carbons. Then the ethyl is OCH2CH3: another 2 carbons. So total 5 carbons. Wait, but that's not matching the options. The options have C6H12O2, which is six carbons.

Hmm, perhaps the molecule is longer. For example, if the acid part is longer. Let's say, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3, but that would make it C7H12O2, which is beyond the options.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a cyclic ester, but that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the molecule isn't an ester but something else. Let's think about another functional group.

Wait, another possibility: the IR shows a broad peak around 3000, which could be an alcohol (OH) or a carboxylic acid (COOH). But the presence of a carbonyl peak at 1700 suggests ester or ketone, perhaps.

Wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H peak is very broad. But then the 1700 would be the carboxylic acid carbonyl. So if the compound has a carboxylic acid group and another carbonyl, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the broad peak is an alcohol. So the compound is an alcohol with a carbonyl group.

But then, the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests an alkene. So maybe the structure is a ketone with an adjacent double bond and an alcohol group.

But the molecular formula would then have O in both the alcohol and the ketone, which would be O2, making option A (C6H12O2) or option C (C6H10O2) possible.

Hmm, but the mass spec fragment is at 45. If the structure is a cyclic ketone with an alcohol, how would that fragment?

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a diol with a conjugated carbonyl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about double bonds and possible structures. If the molecule has an ester and a conjugated double bond, then the structure would have both a carbonyl (ester) and a double bond adjacent to it. So the IR peaks would be around 1700 (ester) and 1650 (conjugated carbonyl). Wait, but that doesn't make sense, because the ester itself has a carbonyl at 1700, and the conjugated system would lower the wavenumber. So perhaps the 1650 is the conjugated carbonyl, and the 1700 is another carbonyl group, but that would require two carbonyls. So maybe an ester and a ketone. But then, the formula would have O2, which would fit options A and C.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, which is a lactone. Lactones have a cyclic ester structure, which would have a carbonyl. But then, the other peak at 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, perhaps in an aromatic ring. But not sure.

Wait, let's get back to the mass spec. If the fragment is C2H5O (45), then the ester is likely to have an ethyl group, making the fragment possible. So the molecular formula would include an ethyl group.

So, for option C: C6H10O2. Which is possible for an ester with a longer chain.

Alternatively, the fragment could be from a different part of the molecule. Maybe the molecule is a diethyl something, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: the molecular formula is C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees, which could be one double bond and one ring, or two double bonds.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. So another degree could be a ring, or another double bond.

Wait, maybe the molecule is an ester with a six-membered ring, but that may not fit the data.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a substituted cyclopentene with an ester group. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: think about the degrees of unsaturation for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree: could be a ring or a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees: (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees: (14-10)/2=2. Two degrees.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees: (14 -12)/2=1. So one degree.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. So options B, C, and D have at least one double bond, but option A only has one degree, which could be a double bond or a ring.

So, considering the IR and NMR, the presence of a double bond is likely, so options B, C, D, and perhaps A could have a double bond.

But the mass spec shows a fragment of 45 (C2H5O). So if the ester is part of the molecule, it likely has an ethyl group. So the formula should include C2H5O.

Looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. If it's an ester, would it have an ethyl group? Let's see: an ethyl ester would have the formula C6H12O2. For example, ethyl propionate is C3H6O2, but our formula is C6H12O2. So perhaps a longer chain. Let's see: if the acid part is C4H8O2, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a different part of the molecule. Maybe the molecule has a five-membered ring with an ester group.

Wait, but the key point is that the fragment is 45, which is C2H5O. So if the molecule has an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, it can fragment to give that.

Putting this together, perhaps the molecular formula is C6H10O2, which is option C.

So, the initial analysis suggests the presence of an ester group (IR at 1700), a conjugated carbonyl (1650), a double bond (vinyl H in NMR), and a fragment that suggests an ethyl group (45 in mass spec).

Therefore, the formula is likely C6H10O2, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To identify the unknown compound, we analyze the spectroscopic data provided:

### FTIR Analysis:
- A broad absorption peak at **3000 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or ester.
- Strong absorption peaks at **1700 cm⁻¹** and **1650 cm⁻¹** indicate the presence of carbonyl groups. The peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is consistent with an ester or ketone, while the peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ suggests a conjugated carbonyl group, such as an α,β-unsaturated ester.

### ¹H NMR Analysis:
- Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens (CH₂=CH-) indicate the presence of a double bond in the molecule.

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** suggests the presence of a fragment with the molecular formula **C₂H₅O** (45 = 2×12 + 5×1 + 16).

### Degrees of Unsaturation:
The degrees of unsaturation for each option are calculated as follows:
- **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂):** Degrees of unsaturation = 1 (one ring or one double bond).
- **Option B (C₆H₁₀O):** Degrees of unsaturation = 2 (one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds).
- **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂):** Degrees of unsaturation = 2 (one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds).
- **Option D (C₆H₁₂O):** Degrees of unsaturation = 1 (one ring or one double bond).

### Key Observations:
1. The presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR indicates at least one double bond, meaning the compound must have at least one degree of unsaturation from a double bond.
2. The IR data suggests the presence of two carbonyl groups (one ester and one conjugated carbonyl), consistent with an α,β-unsaturated ester.
3. The mass spectrometry fragment at **m/z = 45** corresponds to **C₂H₅O**, suggesting the presence of an ethyl group in the molecule.

### Conclusion:
The compound is most consistent with **C₆H₁₀O₂** (Option C). This formula accounts for the IR data (two carbonyl groups), the NMR data (vinyl hydrogens), and the mass spectrometry data (fragment at m/z = 45 corresponding to an ethyl group). Additionally, the degrees of unsaturation match the structural features inferred from the spectroscopic data.
