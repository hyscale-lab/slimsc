Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance (or mean path) is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula I think is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ) multiplied by the velocity (βc), so the distance L = βcτ. But wait, I might be mixing up some terms. Oh right, because velocity is a fraction of the speed of light (β = v/c), so the distance would be in terms of c and τ.

But I need to find τ first. I think the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime. Oh yeah, the uncertainty principle: Γ is the total decay width, and the lifetime τ is the inverse of the width, but considering the reduced Planck constant. So Γ = ħ/τ, or τ = ħ/(Γ). But wait, I should get the units right. 

Wait, let's think in terms of natural units where ħ = c = 1. But maybe that's complicating things. Let me think in SI units.

Γ is given in MeV. I need to convert it to energy in joules. Because ħ has units of J·s. So, let's compute Γ in joules. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So 320 MeV is 320e6 eV. So 320e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 320e6 * 1.602e-19 = let's calculate that.

320e6 is 3.2e8. So 3.2e8 * 1.602e-19 = 3.2 * 1.602 * 1e-11. 3.2 * 1.602 is approximately 5.1264. So 5.1264e-11 J. So Γ ≈ 5.1264e-11 J.

Now, τ = ħ / Γ. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So τ = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (5.1264e-11 J) ≈ (1.05457e-34) / (5.1264e-11) = let's compute this. 1.05457 / 5.1264 is about 0.2057. Then, exponents: 1e-34 / 1e-11 is 1e-23. So 0.2057e-23 seconds, which is 2.057e-24 seconds.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait a second, I'm getting a very small number. Is that right? Or did I make a mistake in units somewhere?

Wait, no, let's think again. The decay width Γ is given as 320 MeV. But in units where ħc is in GeV·fm (femtometers), perhaps there's a smarter way to compute this without going through all the unit conversions. Because that might be easier.

Wait, I remember that lifetime τ can be calculated using the formula τ = ħ / (Γ c²) ? No, wait, no. Wait, the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime. In natural units (ħ = c = 1), the width Γ is equal to 1/τ, but in units where ħ isn't 1, it's Γ = ħ / τ.

Wait, let me think again. The total decay width Γ is given by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But we have to be careful with the units.

Wait, but in particle physics, often the width is given in energy units (like MeV), and the lifetime is often calculated using τ = ħ / Γ. But since ħ is in J·s and Γ in J, this works.

But maybe there's a different approach. Let me think about relativistic decay length. The decay length L is given by L = β c τ. So L = β c * (ħ / Γ). 

But wait, another approach: The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. Then, the decay length is L = τ * v. Because the particle is moving at velocity v, so the distance it travels before decaying is τ multiplied by v. So, yeah, L = v * τ = v * (ħ / Γ) = (β c) * (ħ / Γ).

Hmm, but I need to compute beta as well. Beta is v/c. So beta is sqrt(1 - (m_X c²)^2 / (E_X c²)^2 )? Wait, no. Wait, energy E is the total energy of the particle, which includes rest mass energy. So, E_X = gamma m_X c^2. So, gamma is E_X / (m_X c²). Then, beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Alternatively, beta can be found from beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4) / (E^2)) ), but perhaps it's easier to compute gamma first.

Wait, given E_X is 8 GeV, and m_X is 1.2 GeV. So E_X = 8 GeV, m_X c² = 1.2 GeV.

So gamma gamma = E_X / (m_X c²) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.66667.

Then, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)) ) = sqrt(1 - (1/( (8/1.2)^2 )) ) = sqrt(1 - (1/(6.6667^2))) = 6.6667^2 is about 44.4444. So 1/44.4444 ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Then sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

Now, back to the decay length L. L = beta c tau.

Compute tau first. τ = ħ / Γ. But Γ is 320 MeV. Again, I think I need to convert Γ into the same units as ħ to compute tau.

Wait, but perhaps using natural units would be easier. Let's think in terms of GeV and seconds.

But perhaps it's better to compute in natural units where c=1, but I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.

Alternatively, I can calculate the decay length using the formula:

L = (c * tau) * beta.

But tau is ħ / Γ.

So L = beta c * (ħ / Γ).

But I need to make sure all units are compatible.

Let me compute ħ in GeV·s. Because ħ is approximately 6.5823e-25 GeV·s. Since 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, but perhaps I can remember that ħc is about 197.33 MeV·fm, but that might not help here.

Wait, let's get ħ in units of GeV·s.

Planck's constant ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

1 J = 1e9 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 1.602e-10 J per eV, but wait, no: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So 1 GeV = 1e9 eV = 1e9 * 1.602e-19 J = 1.602e-10 J.

So, ħ in GeV·s is:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s * (1 GeV / 1.602e-10 J) ) 

So,

1 GeV = 1.602e-10 J → 1 J = 6.2415e18 eV → but maybe better to compute 1 J = 1e9 GeV * 1.602e-19 J.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the conversion factor.

So, 1 J = 6.2415e18 eV → 1 J = 6.2415e12 GeV.

Wait, wait.

1 GeV = 1e9 eV.

1 J = 6.242e18 eV → so 1 J = 6.242e18 eV = 6.242e9 GeV.

So, to convert ħ from J·s to GeV·s: ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s = 1.0545718e-34 * (1 J) * s.

But 1 J = 6.242e9 GeV → so 1 J·s = 6.242e9 GeV·s.

So,

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s * (6.242e9 GeV/J) ) = 1.0545718e-34 * 6.242e9 GeV·s.

Let me compute that: 1.05457e-34 * 6.242e9 = approx 6.586e-25 GeV·s.

So, ħ ≈ 6.586e-25 GeV·s.

So, τ = ħ / Γ.

But Γ is 320 MeV. Wait, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So, τ = (6.586e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.586 / 0.32 ) * 1e-25 s.

6.586 / 0.32 is about 20.578. So tau is approximately 20.578e-25 s, which is 2.0578e-24 seconds.

Then, the decay length L = beta * c * tau.

Beta is approximately 0.9887, c is 3e8 m/s.

So, L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.0578e-24 s.

Compute this:

0.9887 * 3e8 = approx 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.0578e-24 s: 2.966e8 m/s * 2.0578e-24 s = let's compute 2.966 * 2.0578 ≈ 6.114.

Exponents: 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.

So, 6.114e-16 meters.

Wait, but that's approximately 6e-16 m. But looking at the options, the closest is option D (4.0655e-16) and option A (5.022e-16). Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise in the calculation steps.

Let me redo the calculation step by step.

First, compute beta more accurately.

Gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666666... So gamma = 6.6666667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1/(44.444444))) ) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

But perhaps a more precise calculation.

1/gamma^2 = 1/( (8/1.2)^2 ) = 1/( (20/3)^2 ) = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) = ?

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775). Let's approximate.

0.9775 is between 0.977 and 0.978.

sqrt(0.977) ≈ 0.9884, because 0.9884^2 = (0.988)^2 = 0.976144, which is a bit low. 0.9885^2 = (0.988 +0.0005)^2 = 0.988^2 + 2*0.988*0.0005 + 0.0005^2 = 0.976144 + 0.000988 + 0.00000025 = ~0.97713225. Which is pretty close to 0.9775.

So sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

Now, compute tau.

Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = ħ / (Gamma) = (6.586e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 6.586e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 20.578e-25 s = 2.0578e-24 s.

So that's correct.

Then, decay length L = beta * c * tau.

beta is 0.9887, c is 3e8 m/s.

So L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.0578e-24 s.

Compute 0.9887 * 3e8 = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.0578e-24 s: 2.9661e8 * 2.0578e-24 = let's compute 2.9661 * 2.0578 = about 6.114.

And 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16. So 6.114e-16 m.

But the options don't have 6e-16. The options are A: ~5e-16, B: ~4e-15, C: ~5e-15, D: ~4e-16.

Hmm, so none of the options match 6e-16. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the ħ value. Let me recompute ħ in GeV·s.

I thought ħ is about 6.586e-25 GeV·s. Let me confirm that.

I know that ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. Let's see, 197 MeV·fm. Since 1 fm is 1e-15 m, and 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV. So 197 MeV fm is 0.197 GeV·fm.

Alternatively, to find ħ in GeV·s, perhaps using ħc = 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, since c is 3e8 m/s, but 1 fm = 1e-15 m, so c is 3e8 m/s = 3e23 fm/s.

So, ħ = (ħc) / c. So,

ħc = 197.33 MeV·fm → 0.19733 GeV·fm.

So, ħ = (0.19733 GeV·fm) / c = (0.19733 GeV·fm) / (3e23 fm/s) ) → 0.19733 / 3e23 GeV·s → approximately 6.5777e-25 GeV·s.

Which matches our previous calculation. So ħ ≈ 6.5777e-25 GeV·s.

So, tau is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the decay width. Let me recheck the units.

Wait, the width is given as 320 MeV. So in GeV, that's 0.32 GeV. So tau is 6.586e-25 / 0.32 → 2.0578e-24 s.

So that's correct.

So, decay length L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.0578e-24 s.

Compute 0.9887 * 3e8 = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.0578e-24 s: 2.9661e8 * 2.0578e-24 = let me compute 2.9661 * 2.0578.

2.9661 * 2 = 5.9322.

2.9661 * 0.0578 = approx 0.1712.

Total is 5.9322 +0.1712 ≈ 6.1034.

So, 6.1034e-16 m.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. Let me re-examine the options.

Options are:

A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m

B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m

C) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m

D) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m

Hmm, so none of the options match 6e-16. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I should calculate beta more accurately. Maybe using exact gamma.

Gamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6666666667.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2)) ) = sqrt(1 - 1/(44.44444444)) ) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775).

Wait, let's compute sqrt(0.9775) more accurately.

Let me compute 0.9887^2: (0.9887)^2 = 0.9887 * 0.9887.

0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.

0.0087 * 0.98 = 0.008526.

0.98 * 0.0087 = same as above.

0.0087 * 0.0087 ≈ 0.00007569.

So, adding up: (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0087 + 0.0087^2 = 0.9604 + 0.017388 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.97786369.

But 0.9887^2 ≈ 0.97786, which is more than 0.9775.

So the actual beta is a bit less than 0.9887.

Let me compute beta using more precise square roots.

We have 0.9775. Let's find x where x^2 = 0.9775.

x=0.9887 → x²=0.97786 (as above). Which is larger than 0.9775. So x should be a little less than 0.9887.

Let me compute 0.9885^2.

0.9885 *0.9885:

= (0.988 + 0.0005)^2 = 0.988² + 2*0.988 * 0.0005 + 0.0005².

0.988² = (approx) 0.976144.

2*0.988 * 0.0005 = 0.000988.

0.0005²=0.00000025.

So 0.976144 + 0.000988 = 0.977132 plus 0.00000025 → 0.97713225.

But 0.97713225 is less than 0.9775. So the actual beta is between 0.9885 and 0.9887.

We need to find x where x²=0.9775.

x=0.9885: x²=0.97713225.

x=0.9886: let's compute (0.9885 + 0.0001)^2.

= 0.9885² + 2*0.9885*0.0001 + 0.0001².

= 0.97713225 + 0.0001977 + 0.00000001.

= 0.97732996.

Still less than 0.9775.

x=0.98865:

x² = (0.9885 + 0.00015)^2.

= 0.9885² + 2*0.9885 * 0.00015 + (0.00015)^2.

= 0.97713225 + 0.00029655 + 0.0000000225.

= 0.9774288225.

Still less than 0.9775.

x=0.98867:

x^2 = (0.9886)^2 + 2*(0.9886)*(0.00007) + (0.00007)^2.

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to compute the difference.

At x=0.98865, x²=0.9774288.

We need to reach 0.9775.

The difference is 0.9775 - 0.9774288 = 0.0000712.

The derivative of x² is 2x. At x=0.98865, derivative is 1.9773.

So delta_x ≈ delta/(2x) = 0.0000712 / (1.9773) ≈ 3.6e-5.

So x ≈ 0.98865 + 0.000036 → 0.988686.

So beta ≈ 0.988686.

So more accurately, beta is approximately 0.988686.

So beta is about 0.98869.

So earlier approximation of 0.9887 is good enough, but perhaps this more precise value would change the result slightly.

So, let's redo the calculation with beta = 0.98869.

L = beta * c * tau = 0.98869 * 3e8 m/s * 2.0578e-24 s.

Compute 0.98869 * 3e8: 0.98869 *3 = 2.96607, so 2.96607e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.0578e-24 s: 2.96607e8 * 2.0578e-24 = (2.96607 * 2.0578) * 1e-16.

2.96607 * 2.0578 ≈ ?

Let me compute 2.96607 * 2 =5.93214.

2.96607 * 0.0578 ≈ 0.1713.

So total ≈ 5.93214 + 0.1713 ≈ 6.10344.

So 6.10344e-16 m.

Again, this is about 6.1e-16 m, which is not one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should be using the relativistic mean lifetime, considering the velocity.

Wait, another formula I've heard is that the decay length is (gamma * beta c * tau_rest), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is L = gamma * beta c tau.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The proper lifetime (tau) is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. The observed lifetime (tau') is gamma * tau. Because from the lab frame, the particle is moving, so time dilation occurs.

So, tau' = gamma * tau.

The decay length is velocity (v) multiplied by the observed lifetime: L = v * tau' = v * gamma tau.

So, L = beta c * gamma tau.

Wait, that's different from what I computed earlier. Because earlier I did L = beta c tau.

But if tau' = gamma tau, then L = beta c gamma tau.

Wait, so where did I go wrong? Because earlier I used L = beta c tau, but perhaps it's L = beta c gamma tau.

Let me re-examine.

The mean proper lifetime is tau = ħ/(Γ). The observed lifetime is tau' = gamma tau.

So, the decay length is L = v tau' = beta c tau' = beta c gamma tau.

So, L = beta c gamma (ħ / Γ).

Wait, so I missed the gamma factor earlier. Oh no! That's a big mistake.

So, the correct formula is L = beta c gamma (ħ / Γ).

So, let me recalculate with this correction.

Compute gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666667.

So, L = 0.98869 * 3e8 m/s * 6.6666667 * (6.586e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV )

Wait, let me break this down.

First, compute (6.586e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 6.586e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.0578e-24 s.

Then multiply by gamma: 6.6666667 * 2.0578e-24 ≈ 13.718e-24 s.

Multiply by beta c: 0.98869 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So, L = 2.966e8 m/s * 13.718e-24 s.

Compute 2.966e8 * 13.718e-24 = (2.966 * 13.718) * 1e-16.

Compute 2.966 * 13.718:

2 *13.718 = 27.436.

0.966 *13.718 ≈ 13.265.

Total is around 27.436 +13.265 ≈ 40.701.

So, 40.701e-16 m = 4.0701e-15 m.

Wait, that's approximately 4.07e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m. So option B is close.

Wait, but I thought earlier I had a different approach. Let me redo the calculation more precisely.

Compute gamma as 8 / 1.2 = 6.66666666667.

Compute tau = ħ / Γ.

ħ =6.586e-25 GeV s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So, tau = 6.586e-25 / 0.32 = 2.0575e-24 s.

Then, tau' = gamma * tau = 6.66666667 * 2.0575e-24 = 13.713e-24 s.

Beta is approximately 0.98869.

c =3e8 m/s.

So L = beta * c * tau'.

beta * c = 0.98869 *3e8 ≈ 2.96607e8 m/s.

Multiply by tau'=13.713e-24 s.

2.96607e8 m/s *13.713e-24 s = (2.96607 *13.713) * 1e-16.

Compute 2.96607 *13.713.

Let me compute 2*13.713=27.426.

0.96607*13.713.

0.9 *13.713=12.3417.

0.06607 *13.713 ≈ 0.904.

So total 12.3417 +0.904=13.2457.

So total is 27.426 +13.2457=40.6717.

So 40.6717e-16 m =4.06717e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.067e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.

So the correct answer should be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \beta c \gamma \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle,
- \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) is the decay width,
- \( \hbar \approx 6.586 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) is the reduced Planck constant.

### Step 1: Compute \( \gamma \)
The energy of the particle is \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), and its rest mass energy is \( m_X c^2 = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Thus:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X c^2} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \beta \)
The relation between \( \beta \) and \( \gamma \) is:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.4444}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is given by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Substituting \( \hbar = 6.586 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\tau = \frac{6.586 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.0578 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( L \)
The observed lifetime in the lab frame is \( \tau' = \gamma \tau \), and the decay length is:

\[
L = \beta c \tau' = \beta c \gamma \tau
\]

Substituting \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), \( \gamma = 6.6667 \), and \( \tau = 2.0578 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 6.6667 \cdot 2.0578 \times 10^{-24}
\]

First, compute \( \beta c \):

\[
\beta c = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \approx 2.9661 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Next, compute \( \gamma \tau \):

\[
\gamma \tau = 6.6667 \cdot 2.0578 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.3713 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

Finally, compute \( L \):

\[
L = (2.9661 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.3713 \times 10^{-23}) \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The closest option to \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.
