Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mouse model. The setup is that the researcher introduced a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the GADD45G coding sequence. They transfected this into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed as expected.

Looking at the DNA sequence provided, I need to find what's wrong. Let's see... The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon, so that's correct. The HA tag is at the beginning, so the coding sequence should have the HA sequence followed by GADD45G.

Wait, the problem might be in the reading frame or some stop codon. Let me check for any in-frame stop codons in the sequence. The HA tag is part of the coding sequence, so if there's a stop codon (like TAG, TGA, or TAA) within the HA or the GADD45G part, the protein would terminate early.

Looking through the sequence, let's scan for these codons. Each codon is three nucleotides, so I'll go through every third base.

Starting at the beginning: ATG (start), then TAC (tyrosine), CCA (proline), TAC (tyrosine), etc. Let me look for TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Looking through the sequence, when I get to the end, I see ...GAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, the very end is TGA. Let me check: the last part is ...GAGTGA. So the last codon is TGA. TGA is a stop codon. Oh, that's a problem. Because that would terminate the translation early.

The HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the HA coding sequence is followed by the GADD45G coding. If the HA is correctly added, the GADD45G coding should follow without a premature stop.

But in the given sequence, after the HA, the GADD45G is being read, but ends with TGA. So the stop codon is in the middle of the HA or the GADD45G coding sequence.

Wait, but the HA is introduced at the N-terminus, so the HA sequence is at the beginning. The HA tag's coding sequence is added before the GADD45G. So if the HA sequence ends with a stop codon, that would cause the ribosome to terminate before the actual GADD45G is even translated.

Wait, the HA tag is a short peptide, so its coding sequence should be a few codons, maybe like YPYDVPDY, which is about 10 amino acids. The coding sequence would be something like ATG TAC (Tyr), then other codons. But in the given sequence, after the start codon (ATG), the next codon is TAC, which is Tyr, as expected for HA.

But wait, the end of this sequence is TGA. That's a stop codon. So in the construct, the GADD45G coding sequence is followed by a TGA. So the entire construct ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. Oh, but wait, when the construct is made, the HA is added at the N-terminus, and then the GADD45G follows. If the HA is added correctly, the stop codon for HA should not be present? Or maybe, the construct includes the entire GADD45G coding sequence, which in this case ends with TGA. 

Wait, in the given sequence, the last part is ...GAGTGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the GADD45G coding would have a stop codon at the end, which is normal because proteins typically end with a stop codon. But in this construct, the HA is at the beginning, so the coding is HA followed by GADD45G, ending with TGA. So the construct is correct in that sense.

Wait, but in the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. So maybe there's an in-frame stop codon earlier than expected, causing the protein not to be expressed. Let me check the entire sequence for any other in-frame stops.

Let me go through the sequence in triplets. Starting from ATG:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTA CGG AAA GCA CAG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTC CGG CGT CTA GAG TCA GCC AAA GTC TTG AAC GTG GAC CCC CGA CAA TGT GAC CTG TGT GTG CTG GCT GCG GGG TGA GGA GGA CGG GAC GAG GGG CGA CAT CGC GCT GCA GAT CCA TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GCT TCT GCT GCG AGA ACA GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GTG GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGG TGC GCC GGC GAC CTG CAC TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAG GAC GCG CTG GAA GGA AGC TCA GCC TGT TTG CGA GGA GAG AGC GCA GCG TTA CGA CTG GGT GCC CAG CAT CAC CCT CCCC GAG TGA.

Wait, now I'm seeing multiple TGA codons. For example, at position 12: TGA is a stop. Then at position 76: TGA again, and at the very end, position 142: TGA as well.

So the first TGA is at position 12: codon 12 is TGA, which is a stop. So this would cause the ribosome to terminate the translation early, right after the 12th codon. That would mean the protein would only be about 12 amino acids long, which is way too short. So the HA tag is added, but the construct has a premature stop codon in the coding sequence.

Wait, but the HA is a short peptide. Let's think: the HA tag is probably a few amino acids, maybe 6-10. So if the first stop is at codon 12, which is after the HA sequence, that would cause the HA to be expressed and then the stop. So the construct would produce a small peptide, not the full-length GADD45G.

But in the setup, the problem is that the overexpression isn't happening. If the construct is producing a small peptide, maybe that's why the protein isn't being detected. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is causing a problem.

Wait, but the HA tag is supposed to be part of the coding sequence. Let me think: the construct is HA followed by GADD45G, but in the given sequence, after the HA, there's a TGA (stop) at codon 12. So the HA sequence is only 12 codons, which is 4 amino acids longer than the HA tag. Wait, the HA tag is usually about 10 amino acids. So maybe the construct has an in-frame stop codon after the HA, causing the HA to be correctly expressed, but then nothing after that. Or perhaps the HA sequence is longer but ends with a stop. Either way, the presence of a stop codon in the middle of the coding sequence would cause the protein to be truncated and not expressed as intended.

Wait, but the problem is that the researcher is trying to overexpress GADD45G. So in the construct, GADD45G should come after HA. But if the sequence has a stop codon after the HA, then the GADD45G isn't being expressed. So the resulting protein would be the HA tag and then stop, which is a small protein, not the full-length GADD45G. So the researcher wouldn't see the overexpression of the full-length GADD45G, because the protein is being truncated.

So looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early, which would be the case if there's a premature stop codon in the coding sequence. So that would prevent the full-length protein from being expressed, leading to no overexpression.

Alternatively, option D says the tRNA for the UAA codon doesn't exist in the mouse. Wait, UAA is a stop codon, but all three stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) are recognized by the same release factors, so the tRNA issue is not the case. So option D is unlikely.

Option A says a missense mutation in the HA sequence. But the HA is just a tag; if it's mutated, the protein would be expressed but not recognized by the HA antibody. But the problem here is the lack of overexpression, not the inability to detect the protein.

Option C suggests the lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. Maybe the HA tag is followed directly by GADD45G without a linker, which could cause the protease to cleave. But I'm not sure if that would prevent expression. It might cause the HA to be removed, but the protein might still be expressed and detected. In this case, the issue is no overexpression, so proteolysis might not be the main issue unless the construct is unstable. But I think the presence of an in-frame stop codon is a more likely reason for no expression.

So the problem is that the coding sequence has a premature stop codon, causing the ribosome to terminate early. So the correct answer should be option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The issue lies in the provided DNA sequence, which contains an in-frame stop codon (TGA) at position 12. This stop codon occurs shortly after the start of the coding sequence, well before the GADD45G coding sequence is fully translated. As a result, the ribosome terminates translation prematurely, producing a truncated protein consisting only of the initial portion of the HA tag and not the full-length GADD45G protein. This explains why the researcher is unable to overexpress the intended protein.

**Analysis of the options:**

- **Option A:** A missense mutation in the HA sequence would alter the HA tag but would not prevent the expression of the full-length GADD45G protein. This does not explain the lack of overexpression.
- **Option B:** The presence of a premature stop codon (TGA) in the coding sequence causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, resulting in a truncated protein and preventing the expression of the full-length GADD45G. This matches the observed issue.
- **Option C:** The lack of a linker sequence could lead to proteolysis, but this would not necessarily prevent the expression of the full-length protein. The issue here is the premature termination of translation, not proteolysis.
- **Option D:** All stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) are recognized by the same translation release factors, so the absence of a specific tRNA is not relevant to this problem.

The most plausible explanation is that the premature stop codon caused the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the expression of the full-length GADD45G protein.
