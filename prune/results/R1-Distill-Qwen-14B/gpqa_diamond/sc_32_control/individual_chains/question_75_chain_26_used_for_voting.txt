Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down.

The person is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They're using a plasmid with the coding sequence modified to include an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with this plasmid using Lipofectamine and are selecting for antibiotic resistance. But when they check, the protein isn't overexpressing as expected.

Looking at the problem, the issue is with the construct they made. The provided DNA sequence is the plus strand of their construct. So I need to analyze this sequence to spot any problems.

First, I should probably check if the reading frame is correct. The HA tag is at the N-terminus, so it should be the first part of the sequence. Then, the GADD45G coding sequence should follow correctly.

Wait, the question is why the protein isn't being overexpressed. The options suggest possible issues with the construct.

Looking at the options:

A) The HA determinant has a missense mutation. That could mean the HA tag is altered, but if the HA sequence is wrong, maybe the purification wouldn't work, but the problem here is with expression levels. Also, the construct might still produce some protein.

B) The ribosome terminated early. That would happen if there are stop codons in the sequence. So any in-frame stop codons in the coding sequence would cause this. Let me check the sequence.

C) Lack of linker causing proteolysis. A linker usually refers to a short amino acid sequence that helps in proper folding or prevents degradation. Without it, the protein might be broken down. But the question is about the construct's DNA sequence leading to the issue.

D) Mouse lacks tRNA for UAA. Wait, UAA is a stop codon. If the mouse's tRNA can't recognize a certain codon, but UAA is a standard stop codon. Wait, no, the tRNA for UAA doesn't exist because tRNAs don't translate stop codons. So, if the construct introduces a UAA codon, the ribosome would stop, leading to truncated proteins or nothing. But does the construct have such a codon?

Wait, looking at the DNA sequence, I should check for any in-frame stop codons. Because if the coding sequence has a stop codon early on, the ribosome would terminate translation early, leading to no protein or a truncated version.

So let's look for TGA, TAG, or TAA triplets in the coding sequence because those are stop codons when in the coding frame.

The sequence is long, so let me scan for these triplets.

Looking for TGA, TAG, or TAA in the DNA. Remember, the mRNA is made from the DNA, which is transcribed as the complement. So the DNA's coding strand (which is given) will have the same sequence as the mRNA except T instead of U.

So any occurrence of TGA in the DNA coding strand would be TGA in mRNA, which is a stop codon. Similarly, TAA in DNA would be TAA in mRNA (stop), and TAG would be TAG (stop).

Looking through the sequence:

The sequence starts with ATG, which is a start codon, so that's good.

Let me scan:

Looking for TGA, TAG, TAA in triplets.

Let's go through the sequence step by step.

Looking for "TGA", "TAG", or "TAA" in the given DNA sequence.

Looking at the first few bases:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... 

So the first triplet after ATG is TAC, which is Tyr. Then CCA is Pro, and so on. Let's look for any of the stop codons.

Looking for TGA:

Looking for T followed by G and A. Let's see:

Looking through the sequence:

Looking for TGA:

In the middle: ...TGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC... Hmm. Let's see. TGATGTT: TGA is at positions... Let's see, 10th position: maybe.

Wait, perhaps I should look for each triplet systematically.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence has a TGA somewhere.

Wait, let's look at the sequence step by step, in triplets:

The sequence given is:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G T T C C A G A T T A C G C C A A T G A C T C T G G A A G A A T C C G C G G C C A G G A C A C A G T T C C G G A A G C A C A G C C A G G A T G C A G G G T G C C G G G A A A G C G C T G C A G A G T T G C T G C T G T C G C G C A G C G T C A G G G C T G C C T C A C T G C C G C G T C T A C G A G T C A G C C A A G T C T T G A A C G T G G A C C C C A G A C T G T G A C C T T C T G T G T G C G G C T G A G G A G G A C G A G G G C G A C A T C G C G C T G C A G A T C C A T T T A C G C T G A T C C A G G C T T T C T G C T G C G A G A A C G A C A T C G A C A T A G T G C G C G T G G C G A T G T G C A G C G G C T G G C G C A T C G T G G C G C C G G C G A G G A G G C G G G T G C G C C G G G C A C T G C A C G C A T C C T C A T T T G C G A G G A G A G C C G A G C G T T A A C G A C T G G G T G C C C A G C A T C A C C C C C C G A G T G A 3'

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for the triplet patterns.

Let me write the entire sequence as triplets:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G T T C C A G A T T A C G C C A A T G A C T C T G G A A G A A T C C G C G G C C A G G A C A C A G T T C C G G A A G C A C A G C C A G G A T G C A G G G T G C C G G G A A A G C G C T G C A G A G T T G C T G C T G T C G C G C A G C G T C A G G G C T G C C T C A C T G C C G C G T C T A C G A G T C A G C C A A G T C T T G A A C G T G G A C C C A G A C T G T G A C C T T C T G T G T G C G G C T G A G G A G G A C G A G G G C G A C A T C G C G C T G C A G A T C C A T T T A C G C T G A T C C A G G C T T T C T G C T G C G A G A A C G A C A T C G A C A T A G T G C G C G T G G C G A T G T G C A G C G G C T G G C G C A T C G T G G C G C C G G C G A G G A G G C G G G T G C G C C G G G C A C T G C A C G C A T C C T C A T T T G C G A G G A G A G C C G A G C G T T A A C G A C T G G G T G C C C A G C A T C A C C C C C G A G T G A

Looking for any TGA, TAG, TAA in the triplets.

Looking:

- First triplet: ATG (start)
- Then TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, G T T (GTG?), wait maybe I should group correctly. Let me recount.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in splitting into triplets. Let me make sure.

The entire DNA sequence is 5' to 3', and each codon is three nucleotides. So let me split the entire sequence into triplets starting from the beginning.

The sequence is:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G T T C C A G A T T A C G C C A A T G A C T C T G G A A G A A T C C G C G G C C A G G A C A C A G T T C C G G A A G C A C A G C C A G G A T G C A G G G T G C C G G G A A A G C G C T G C A G A G T T G C T G C T G T C G C G C A G C G T C A G G G C T G C C T C A C T G C C G C G T C T A C G A G T C A G C C A A G T C T T G A A C G T G G A C C C A G A C T G T G A C C T T C T G T G T G C G G C T G A G G A G G A C G A G G G C G A C A T C G C G C T G C A G A T C C A T T T A C G C T G A T C C A G G C T T T C T G C T G C G A G A A C G A C A T C G A C A T A G T G C G C G T G G C G A T G T G C A G C G G C T G G C G C A T C G T G G C G C C G G C G A G G A G G C G G G T G C G C C G G G C A C T G C A C G C A T C C T C A T T T G C G A G G A G A G C C G A G C G T T A A C G A C T G G G T G C C C A G C A T C A C C C C C G A G T G A

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for the triplet sequences.

Looking for any triplet that's TGA, TAG, or TAA.

In the sequence, I see:

Looking for TGA.

Looking through the triplets:

- After ATG, TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GTT (GT T?), that's G T T as the next triplet? Wait, perhaps I should group as:

61-63: C A G -> CAG (Gln)

64-66: G G T -> GGT (Gly)

67-69: G C C -> GCC (Ala)

70-72: G G G -> GGG (Gly)

73-75: A A A -> AAA (Lys)

76-78: G C G -> GCG (Ala)

127-129: C A G -> CAG (Gln)

130-132: C G T -> CGT (Arg)

133-135: C A G -> CAG (Gln)

136-138: G G C -> GGC (Gly)

139-141: T G C -> TGC (Cys)

142-144: G G G -> GGG (Gly)

145-147: A A A -> AAA (Lys)

148-150: G C G -> GCG (Ala)

151-153: C T G -> CTG (Leu)

154-156: C T G -> CTG (Leu)

157-159: T G C -> TGC (Cys)

160-162: G C G -> GCG (Ala)

163-165: C A G -> CAG (Gln)

166-168: C G T -> CGT (Arg)

169-171: C A G -> CAG (Gln)

172-174: G G C -> GGC (Gly)

175-177: C G C -> CGC (Arg)

178-180: G T G -> GTG (Val)

181-183: A C C -> ACC (Thr)

190-192: T G C -> TGC (Cys)

193-195: G G C -> GGC (Gly)

196-198: C T A -> CT A (Leu?)

Wait, maybe I'm getting this messed up. Alternatively, perhaps I can just check if any triplet is a stop codon.

Looking through the above triplets:

- TGA: Do any of the triplets equal TGA? Let's see. The triplet positions:

Looking at each triplet:

ATG, TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GTT, CCA, GAT, TAC, GCC, AAT, GAC, TCT, GGA, AGA, ATC, CGC, GGC, CAG, GGA, CAG, GGT, GCC, GGG, AAA, GCG, CTG, CAG, AGG, CTG, CTG, TGC, AGG, CAG, CGT, CAG, GGC, TGC, GGG, AAA, GCG, CTG, CTG, TGC, GCG, CAG, CGT, CAG, GGC, CGC, GTG, ACC, TGG, CGA, TGC, GGC, CTG, CAG, CGT, CAG, GGC, CCG, GGA, CGA, TGA.

Wait, in the triplet list, is there a TGA anywhere? Let's see:

Looking through the list:

Triplet 178-180: CGC (Arg)
181-183: ACC
184-186: TGG (Trp)
187-189: CGA (Arg)
190-192: TGC (Cys)
193-195: GGC (Gly)
196-198: CTG (Leu)
197-199: TGA? Wait, no, CTG is triplet 196-198.

Wait, maybe I missed a triplet. Let me recount some parts.

Wait, looking at the given DNA sequence, let me search for the exact substring where a stop codon might be.

Looking for TGA in the DNA:

The DNA is 5' to 3'.

So the mRNA will be complementary to the DNA, so the mRNA is the same as the DNA except T becomes U.

So any occurrence of TGA in the DNA would be TGA in mRNA, which is a stop.

Looking through the DNA:

5' [...] TGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Looking for TGA in the DNA:

Looking for T-G-A anywhere in the DNA.

Looking at the middle of the sequence, I see "TGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA"

Wait, I see "TGA" in the DNA at position:

Looking for TGA: Let me see. The DNA sequence includes "TGA" towards the end.

In the sequence towards the end: ...AACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

So the substring is ...GAGTGA... ?

Wait, no, the last part is ...GAGTGA3'.

So the last triplet is TGA (positions before the end). So in DNA, that's TGA.

But wait, that's at the very end.

So in the DNA sequence, the last triplet is TGA (positions 196-198?), but wait, the overall DNA sequence ends with TGA.

So the sequence ends with TGA. So the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon.

So if the DNA has a TGA at the end, the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon. So the protein would terminate at that point.

So the GADD45G coding sequence is being cut short because there's a stop codon at the end.

Wait, but let me think: The plasmid was constructed to include the HA tag followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. If the plasmid's coding sequence ends with a stop codon, that's normal because the gene should have a termination codon.

But wait, in the case of the construct, if the HA tag is at the N-terminus, and then the GADD45G starts, perhaps the construct includes the entire coding sequence, including the stop codon. But in the provided DNA, the last triplet is TGA, which would be a stop codon. So where is this TGA located?

Looking at the DNA sequence, the last few bases are ...CGAGTGA3'. So the last three are TGA.

So the DNA ends with TGA, which, in the mRNA, is UGA, a stop codon. So the coding sequence includes a stop codon at the end, which is correct.

Wait, but why is that a problem?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

The problem is that the person couldn't overexpress the protein. So why isn't the protein being expressed?

If the construct has an in-frame stop codon earlier in the sequence, the ribosome would terminate early, producing a truncated protein or nothing. But in the given sequence, the only stop codon I can see is at the very end. So the full-length protein should be expressed.

Wait, but perhaps the HA tag is at the N-terminus, and the construct includes the HA coding sequence followed by GADD45G. So the HA tag's coding sequence must be correctly included.

Wait, perhaps the HA sequence was incorrectly inserted, causing a frameshift or a premature stop.

Looking back, the construct was modified to add the HA sequence at the N-terminus. So perhaps the initial part of the construct is the HA tag. Let me check that.

The HA tag is a short peptide, usually around 11 amino acids. Its DNA sequence would be about 33 nucleotides (11 codons). So the first part of the DNA should be the HA coding sequence.

What's the HA tag's DNA sequence? Let me think. The HA tag is derived from the hemagglutinin of influenza A virus. The commonly used HA tag is from A/NP/8/38, which is 11 residues long: YPYDVPDYASV.

The DNA coding for this would be:

YPYDVPDYASV translates to:

Y: TAC
P: CCA
Y: TAC
D: GAT
V: GTA
P: CCA
D: GAT
Y: TAC
A: GCT
S: AGC
V: GTA

Wait, wait, let me get the correct codon usage. Actually, the exact DNA sequence can vary based on the organism's codon usage, but assuming it's using standard codons.

So Y is TAC, P is CCA, Y is TAC, D is GAT, V is GTA, P is CCA, D is GAT, Y is TAC, A is GCT, S is AGC, V is GTA.

So the HA DNA sequence would be TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA CCA GAT TAC GCT AGC GTA.

Wait, but in the given DNA, the first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G T T C C A G A T T A C G C C A A T G A C T C T G G A A G A A T C C G C G G C C A G G A C A C A G T T C C G G A A G C A C A G C C A G G A T G C A G G G T G C C G G G A A A G C G C T G C A G A G T T G C T G C T G T C G C G C A G C G T C A G G G C T G C C T C A C T G C C G C G T C T A C G A G T C A G C C A A G T C T T G A A C G T G G A C C C A G A C T G T G A C C T T C T G T G T G C G G C T G A G G A G G A C G A G G G C G A C A T C G C G C T G C A G A T C C A T T T A C G C T G A T C C A G G C T T T C T G C T G C G A G A A C G A C A T C G A C A T A G T G C G C G T G G C G A T G T G C A G C G G C T G G C G C A T C G T G G C G C C G G C G A G G A G G C G G G T G C G C C G G G C A C T G C A C G C A T C C T C A T T T G C G A G G A G A G C C G A G C G T T A A C G A C T G G G T G C C C A G C A T C A C C C C C G A G T G A.

So the first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G T T C C A G A T T A C G C C A A T G A C T C T G G A A G A A T C C G C G G C C A G G A C A C A G T T C C G G A A G C A C A G C C A G G A T G C A G G G T G C C G G G A A A G C G C T G C A G A G T T G C T G C T G T C G C G C A G C G T C A G G G C T G C C T C A C T G C C G C G T C T A C G A G T C A G C C A A G T C T T G A A C G T G G A C C C A G A C T G T G A C C T T C T G T G T G C G G C T G A G G A G G A C G A G G G C G A C A T C G C G C T G C A G A T C C A T T T A C G C T G A T C C A G G C T T T C T G C T G C G A G A A C G A C A T C G A C A T A G T G C G C G T G G C G A T G T G C A G C G G C T G G C G C A T C G T G G C G C C G G C G A G G A G G C G G G T G C G C C G G G C A C T G C A C G C A T C C T C A T T T G C G A G G A G A G C C G A G C G T T A A C G A C T G G G T G C C C A G C A T C A C C C C C G A G T G A.

Wait, the first part of the sequence is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G T T C C A G A T T A C G C C A A T G A C T C T G G A A G A A T C C G C G G C C A G G A C A C A G T T C C G G A A G C A C A G C C A G G A T G C A G G G T G C C G G G A A A G C G C T G C A G A G T T G C T G C T G T C G C G C A G C G T C A G G G C T G C C T C A C T G C C G C G T C T A C G A G T C A G C C A A G T C T T G A A C G T G G A C C C A G A C T G T G A C C T T C T G T G T G C G G C T G A G G A G G A C G A G G G C G A C A T C G C G C T G C A G A T C C A T T T A C G C T G A T C C A G G C T T T C T G C T G C G A G A A C G A C A T C G A C A T A G T G C G C G T G G C G A T G T G C A G C G G C T G G C G C A T C G T G G C G C C G G C G A G G A G G C G G G T G C G C C G G G C A C T G C A C G C A T C C T C A T T T G C G A G G A G A G C C G A G C G T T A A C G A C T G G G T G C C C A G C A T C A C C C C C G A G T G A.

Wait, the first part is:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G T T C C A G A T T A C G C C A A T G A C T C T G G A A G A A T C C G C G G C C A G G A C A C A G T T C C G G A A G C A C A G C C A G G A T G C A G G G T G C C G G G A A A G C G C T G C A G A G T T G C T G C T G T C G C G C A G C G T C A G G G C T G C C T C A C T G C C G C G T C T A C G A G T C A G C C A A G T C T T G A A C G T G G A C C C A G A C T G T G A C C T T C T G T G T G C G G C T G A G G A G G A C G A G G G C G A C A T C G C G C T G C A G A T C C A T T T A C G C T G A T C C A G G C T T T C T G C T G C G A G A A C G A C A T C G A C A T A G T G C G C G T G G C G A T G T G C A G C G G C T G G C G C A T C G T G G C G C C G G C G A G G A G G C G G G T G C G C C G G G C A C T G C A C G C A T C C T C A T T T G C G A G G A G A G C C G A G C G T T A A C G A C T G G G T G C C C A G C A T C A C C C C C G A G T G A.

Wait, the first triplet is ATG (start). The next is TAC (Y), then CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), G T T (Val), C C A (Pro), G A T (Asp), T A C (Tyr), G C C (Ala), A A T (Asn), G A C (Asp), T C T (Ser), G G A (Gly), A G A (Arg), A T C (Ile), C G C (Arg), G G C (Gly), C A G (Gln), G G A (Gly), C A G (Gln), G G T (Gly), G C C (Ala), G G G (Gly), A A A (Lys), G C G (Ala), C T G (Leu), C A G (Gln), A G G (Arg), C T G (Leu), C T G (Leu), T G C (Cys), A G G (Arg), C A G (Gln), C G T (Arg), C A G (Gln), G G C (Gly), T G C (Cys), G G G (Gly), A A A (Lys), G C G (Ala), C T G (Leu), C T G (Leu), T G C (Cys), G C G (Ala), C A G (Gln), C G T (Arg), C A G (Gln), G G C (Gly), C G C (Arg), G T G (Val), A C C (Thr), T G G (Trp), C G A (Arg), T G C (Cys), G G C (Gly), C T A (Leu), C G G (Arg), C T G (Leu), C A G (Gln), C G T (Arg), C A G (Gln), G G C (Gly), C C G (Pro), G G A (Gly), C G A (Arg), T G A (stop).

So the last triplet is TGA, which is a stop codon.

Wait, but the HA tag is at the N-terminus. So the HA coding sequence should come before the GADD45G coding sequence. But in the DNA provided, after ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT..., which is the HA tag's sequence, the rest is the GADD45G.

But looking at the provided DNA, the coding sequence includes the HA tag followed by the GADD45G. Then, at the end, there's a TGA.

Wait, but perhaps the HA tag is not correctly included. Let me compare.

The HA tag's amino acids are YPYDVPDYASV, which is 11 residues. The DNA should be 33 nucleotides long for the HA coding sequence.

Looking at the beginning of the given DNA:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G T T C C A G A T T A C G C C A A T G A C T C T G G A A G A A T C C G C G G C C A G G A C A C A G T T C C G G A A G C A C A G C C A G G A T G C A G G G T G C C G G G A A A G C G C T G C A G A G T T G C T G C T G T C G C G C A G C G T C A G G G C T G C C T C A C T G C C G C G T C T A C G A G T C A G C C A A G T C T T G A A C G T G G A C C C A G A C T G T G A C C T T C T G T G T G C G G C T G A G G A G G A C G A G G G C G A C A T C G C G C T G C A G A T C C A T T T A C G C T G A T C C A G G C T T T C T G C T G C G A G A A C G A C A T C G A C A T A G T G C G C G T G G C G A T G T G C A G C G G C T G G C G C A T C G T G G C G C C G G C G A G G A G G C G G G T G C G C C G G G C A C T G C A C G C A T C C T C A T T T G C G A G G A G A G C C G A G C G T T A A C G A C T G G G T G C C C A G C A T C A C C C C C G A G T G A.

The initial part is:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G T T C C A G A T T A C G C C A A T G A C T C T G G A A G A A T C C G C G G C C A G G A C A C A G T T C C G G A A G C A C A G C C A G G A T G C A G G G T G C C G G G A A A G C G C T G C A G A G T T G C T G C T G T C G C G C A G C G T C A G G G C T G C C T C A C T G C C G C G T C T A C G A G T C A G C C A A G T C T T G A A C G T G G A C C C A G A C T G T G A C C T T C T G T G T G C G G C T G A G G A G G A C G A G G G C G A C A T C G C G C T G C A G A T C C A T T T A C G C T G A T C C A G G C T T T C T G C T G C G A G A A C G A C A T C G A C A T A G T G C G C G T G G C G A T G T G C A G C G G C T G G C G C A T C G T G G C G C C G G C G A G G A G G C G G G T G C G C C G G G C A C T G C A C G C A T C C T C A T T T G C G A G G A G A G C C G A G C G T T A A C G A C T G G G T G C C C A G C A T C A C C C C C G A G T G A.

Wait, that's a lot. Let me count the nucleotides before the GADD45G starts.

Wait, the HA is at the beginning. So the HA sequence should be about 33 nucleotides, but the initial part in the DNA is longer.

Wait, the HA coding sequence would be:

YPYDVPDYASV -> 11 aa = 33 nt.

Looking at the beginning:

ATG (start) is the first codon.

Then TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), G T T (Val), etc.

Wait, the HA tag is YPYDVPDYASV, which is 11 amino acids. So the DNA for HA should be 33 nt. The first 33 bases of the provided DNA are:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G T T C C A G A T T A C G C C A A T

Wait, that's 33 bases. Let me count:

ATG (3) + TAC (3) + CCA (3) + TAC (3) + GAT (3) + G T T (3) + C C A (3) + G A T (3) + T A C (3) + G C C (3) + A A T (3) -> that's 11 codons (33 nt).

So the HA coding sequence is correctly present, followed by the GADD45G coding sequence.

But wait, after the HA, the GADD45G gene's coding sequence should start. Let me see what comes after the HA.

The next codon after the HA sequence is T G A C T C T G G A A G A A T C C G C G G C C A G G A C A C A G T T C C G G A A G C A C A G C C A G G A T G C A G G G T G C C G G G A A A G C G C T G C A G A G T T G C T G C T G T C G C G C A G C G T C A G G G C T G C C T C A C T G C C G C G T C T A C G A G T C A G C C A A G T C T T G A A C G T G G A C C C A G A C T G T G A C C T T C T G T G T G C G G C T G A G G A G G A C G A G G G C G A C A T C G C G C T G C A G A T C C A T T T A C G C T G A T C C A G G C T T T C T G C T G C G A G A A C G A C A T C G A C A T A G T G C G C G T G G C G A T G T G C A G C G G C T G G C G C A T C G T G G C G C C G G C G A G G A G G C G G G T G C G C C G G G C A C T G C A C G C A T C C T C A T T T G C G A G G A G A G C C G A G C G T T A A C G A C T G G G T G C C C A G C A T C A C C C C C G A G T G A.

Wait, after the HA (33 nt), the next codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. Oh wait, no. The next codon after the HA would be TAC, which is part of the HA. Wait, wait, the HA is the first 33 nt, which is 11 codons. After that comes the GADD45G gene's coding sequence.

Wait, no, the HA is the first 33 nt, then the GADD45G coding sequence begins.

Wait, in the DNA provided, after the HA coding sequence, the next codon is TGA. Because the HA is 33 nt, which is 11 codons, and the next triplet is TGA.

So the GADD45G coding sequence starts with TGA. But TGA is a stop codon. So the GADD45G gene's coding sequence starts with a stop codon, which would immediately terminate translation.

Wait, that can't be right. The GADD45G gene's coding sequence would have its own start codon, ATG, which is the beginning of the gene. So if after the HA, the next codon is TGA, that would cause the ribosome to stop, leading to no protein being made beyond that point.

So the issue is that after the HA tag, the GADD45G coding sequence starts with TGA, which is a stop codon. This means that the ribosome stops translating after the HA tag, producing only the HA tag (if the ribosome starts at the HA's start codon). Alternatively, if the ribosome started at the correct start codon, it would stop at TGA, making a small peptide.

Wait, but the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the HA's coding sequence is first, followed by the GADD45G. So the correct sequence should be: ATG (start) HA coding sequence ATG (start of GADD45G) followed by GADD45G's coding.

But in the provided DNA, after the HA, the next codon is TGA, which is a stop. So when the ribosome translates this, after the HA, it hits TGA and stops, meaning the GADD45G isn't expressed. So the construct doesn't produce the full-length protein; it just produces the HA tag, but that's a small peptide, and the overexpression of the full-length GADD45G isn't happening.

Wait, but why would the HA tag's stop codon be after the HA? Because the HA is part of the construct, and the GADD45G starts after.

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake. The HA should be followed by the GADD45G coding sequence, which includes its own start codon. So the construct should have: ATG HA coding sequence ATG GADD45G coding ... TGA.

But in the current DNA, after the HA, it's TGA, which is a stop codon, so the ribosome stops, preventing the translation of GADD45G.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA is correctly placed, but the GADD45G coding sequence starts with TGA, which is a stop. So the construct is adding the HA and then a stop codon, so the GADD45G isn't expressed.

So the problem is that the GADD45G coding sequence starts with TGA, a stop codon, causing translation to terminate early.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

But wait, let me look at the options again.

Option B says the ribosome terminated early because of a stop codon in the construct.

Yes, that's the case here. The GADD45G coding sequence starts with TGA, making the ribosome stop, so no full-length protein is produced.

So the reason the protein isn't overexpressed is that the ribosome can't read through the stop codon, so the protein isn't made.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying why a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein is not working as expected. The provided DNA sequence is the coding strand of the construct, which includes an HA tag at the N-terminus followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. The issue lies in the construct's sequence, which prevents proper translation of the GADD45G protein.

### Key Analysis:
1. **HA Tag Coding Sequence**:  
   The HA tag is correctly included at the N-terminus of the construct. Its coding sequence corresponds to the amino acids YPYDVPDYASV, which translates to the DNA sequence `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA CCA GAT TAC GCT AGC GTA`. This is followed by the GADD45G coding sequence.

2. **Presence of a Stop Codon**:  
   After the HA tag, the next codon in the provided DNA sequence is `TGA` (positions 34–36). In the mRNA, this would translate to `UGA`, a stop codon. This stop codon is in the reading frame of the GADD45G coding sequence, causing the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely.

3. **Impact on Translation**:  
   The premature stop codon prevents the full-length GADD45G protein from being synthesized. Instead, only a truncated peptide (up to the HA tag) is produced, which explains the lack of overexpression of the full-length protein.

4. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: A missense mutation in the HA determinant would affect purification but not necessarily prevent protein expression. This does not explain the lack of overexpression.  
   - **Option B**: The presence of a stop codon (`TGA`) in the GADD45G coding sequence causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing full-length protein synthesis. This matches the observed issue.  
   - **Option C**: A lack of a linker sequence could lead to proteolysis, but this would not prevent translation entirely. The construct would still produce some protein, even if it were degraded.  
   - **Option D**: The absence of a tRNA for the `UAA` codon is irrelevant here, as `UAA` is a standard stop codon, and the issue lies with the `TGA` codon in the construct.

### Conclusion:
The root cause of the problem is the premature stop codon (`TGA`) in the GADD45G coding sequence, which terminates translation early and prevents the synthesis of the full-length protein. This aligns with **Option B**.
