Okay, so I have this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I remember that light's speed in different media depends on the medium's refractive index. But wait, this question adds another layer because the medium itself is moving relative to the observer. Interesting.

Alright, let's break it down. The problem states that a glass with index of refraction n is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. The light is moving toward the observer. So, I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait, what's the usual speed of light in a medium? Oh right, it's c/n. Since c is given as 1 here, the speed should be 1/n. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the glass. But the glass is moving. So I think I need to consider relativistic effects because velocity addition is involved when frames are moving relative to each other.

In special relativity, the velocity addition formula is used when you have velocities in different frames. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, in this case, what's the direction? The glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, which is toward the observer. So, relative to the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. The light's speed in the glass's frame is u = c/n (but wait, in the glass, the speed is v_light = c/n, which is slower than c).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed u = 1/n. Now, the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So, to find the speed of light in the lab frame, I should apply the velocity addition formula.

Wait, but the direction matters. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So, from the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. The light in the glass's frame is moving at u = 1/n towards the observer. Wait, because the problem says the glass is moving toward the observer, and the light is propagating in the same direction as the glass. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at 1/n in the same direction as the glass's motion.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The light is propagating through the glass in the same direction as the glass is moving. So in the glass's frame, the light's speed is 1/n in that direction. Now, when the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, the lab observes the light's speed as (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²), but since c is 1, it's (u + v)/(1 + u*v).

Wait, but u is the speed of light in the glass's frame, which is 1/n. So substituting u = 1/n. So the observed speed is ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n)*v ). Let's compute that.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, in the glass's frame, the light is moving toward the observer at speed 1/n. Since the glass is moving toward the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. Wait, no—wait, the glass is moving toward the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So from the lab frame, the light's direction is toward the observer, same as the glass's motion.

So, in the glass's frame, light is moving at speed 1/n towards the observer, which is in the same direction as the glass's velocity. To find its speed in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass (since the glass is moving at v in the lab frame, the lab is moving at -v relative to the glass), we can apply the velocity addition formula.

Wait, the velocity addition formula is for transforming velocities between frames. If in frame S' (glass), the velocity is u', then in frame S (lab), it's u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c²). But here, the glass is moving at v relative to the lab. So, when the glass is moving at v, the lab's frame is S, and the glass is S'. So, when in S', the light is moving at u' = 1/n in the same direction as v.

So substituting into the formula: u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/c² ). Since c is 1, this becomes ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (1/n) * v ) ).

Wait, but let me think again about the signs. Because if the glass is moving at velocity v toward the observer (so, in the lab frame, the glass is moving in the direction of the light), then in the glass's frame, the light is moving at 1/n in the same direction as the glass's velocity (so u' positive). So, when we apply the velocity addition, the formula should correctly handle the direction.

So, the observed speed in the lab is u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) )

Hmm, but that gives (u + v) / (1 + uv). Let me compute that.

Wait, but none of the options match that. Let me look at the options again.

Options are:

A) (1 + n v)/(n + v)

B) 1

C) (1 +n v)/(n -v )

D) (1 -n v)/(n +v )

Wait, none of these seem to match the expression I have. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me re-express my expression.

I have u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) v ) )

Let me factor out 1/n in the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (1 + n v) / n

Denominator: 1 + v/n = (n + v)/n

So, u becomes [ (1 +n v)/n ] / [ (n +v)/n ] = (1 + n v) / (n +v )

Ah! So the expression simplifies to (1 + n v) / (n + v).

Looking at the options, option A matches this.

Wait, but wait—what about the direction? Because the formula is when the glass is moving in the same direction as the light. So, if the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, and the light is moving toward the observer, then in the lab frame, the light's speed would be u. So, the expression I have is correct.

But wait, I thought in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v toward the observer. So, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So, in the glass's frame, the light's speed is 1/n. So, when adding velocities, the speed in the lab would be higher than 1/n if the glass is moving toward the observer. Does this make sense?

Wait, no. Because in the glass's frame, the light is moving at 1/n. When the glass is moving toward the observer at v, the light's speed relative to the lab might be higher than 1/n. But according to the expression I got, (1 + n v)/(n + v). Let's plug in some numbers to see.

Suppose n is 1 (so glass is like vacuum?), and v is 0. Then the speed should be c=1, which is correct. Plugging in n=1, v=0: (1+0)/(1+0) =1. Correct.

Another test case: n=1, v=0.5. Then u= (1+1*0.5)/(1+0.5) )= (1.5)/(1.5)=1. So, speed is 1. That's correct, because if the medium is moving at 0.5c and light speed is c in that medium, then from lab, the light should still be c. So that makes sense.

Another case: n=2, v=0. Then speed is (1 +0)/(2+0) )= 0.5, which is correct because 1/2 is the speed in glass.

Another case: n=2, v=0. Let me compute u. (1 + 2*0)/(2 +0 )=1/2. Correct.

Another case: n=1, v=0.5. So, u=(1 +1*0.5)/(1+0.5) )= (1.5)/(1.5)=1. Correct because even if the medium is moving at 0.5c, light in vacuum should still go at c.

Wait, what if v is negative? Like if the medium is moving opposite to the light. But in our problem, the medium is moving in the same direction as the light.

So, in the given problem, the expression (1 +n v)/(n +v) seems to hold. So the answer should be option A.

But wait, let me think again. The problem says the glass is moving toward the observer, and the light is propagating in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So, in the lab frame, the light is moving toward the observer, same as the glass's direction. So, the glass is moving toward the observer, and the light is moving toward the observer as well.

Wait, but in the glass's frame, the light is moving at 1/n. So, when the glass is moving at v toward the observer, and the light is moving in that same direction, from the lab frame's perspective, the light's speed is (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n) v )

Which simplifies to (1 +n v)/(n +v). So that's option A.

Wait, but let me check another approach. Because sometimes in relativity, the product of velocities can affect things. But I think the velocity addition formula is correct here.

So, the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we must account for the fact that the glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam. In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass. To find the speed of light in the lab frame, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Since \( c = 1 \) (as given in the problem), this simplifies to:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + u' v}
\]

Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \), we get:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

To simplify further, factor out \( \frac{1}{n} \) in the numerator and denominator:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}} = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Now, comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A:** \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \) — This matches the derived expression.
- **Option B:** \( 1 \) — Incorrect, as it does not account for the refractive index or the velocity \( v \).
- **Option C:** \( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \) — Incorrect, as the denominator has the wrong sign for \( v \).
- **Option D:** \( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \) — Incorrect, as the numerator has the wrong sign for \( v \).

Therefore, the correct answer is **Option A**.
