Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, I remember that σ matrices are antisymmetric and related to the generators of Lorentz transformations. But that might not be directly relevant here.

Wait, the question is about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. I think for that, I need to look at the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian and figure out the dimension of κ.

So, first, the Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions because the action is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4.

The Lagrangian here is L_int, which is an interaction term. So I need to compute the mass dimension of each field and factor involved.

Let me list the fields and parameters:

- ψ is a Dirac spinor. The mass dimension of ψ is 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the Dirac field has dimension 3/2. Because the equation of motion is iγ^μ ∂_μ ψ = m ψ, which suggests the ψ has dimension 3/2 - since the derivative has dimension 1, and the mass term is dimension 3 (m has dimension 1) times ψ squared (each ψ is 3/2, so 3/2 *2=3), so yeah, ψ is 3/2.

- F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, which is the derivative of the gauge field. The gauge field A has dimension 1 (since ∂μ Aν is F, which would have dimension 2?), wait. Wait, F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. So each A has dimension 1 because A is a vector potential. So F has dimension 1 + 1 = 2.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. In four dimensions, the gauge field A has mass dimension 1. So each derivative (which has dimension 1) acting on A makes F have dimension 2.

So F^{μν} has dimension 2.

Now, what about σ_{μν}? Since σ is made from the commutator of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless (gamma matrices are just matrices, no mass dimension). So [γ_mu, gamma_nu] is dimensionless, so σ_{mu nu} is dimensionless. So when we have ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ, each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ ψ would be 3. But wait, we have σ_{mu nu} in between, which is dimensionless, so ψ̄ σ ψ is 3 + 0 =3?

Wait, no, wait: σ_{mu nu} is a tensor (matrix) but dimensionless. So the product ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ would have the same dimension as ψ̄ ψ, which is 3, because each ψ is 3/2. So ψ̄ (3/2) * σ (0) * ψ (3/2), sums to 3.

So the term ψ̄ σ F is (3) * (2) =5. Wait, because ψ̄ σ ψ is 3 and F is 2. So the product is 3 + 2 =5. Because when you multiply terms, their dimensions add.

Wait, no, wait: The term in the Lagrangian is ψ̄ σ ψ F^{mu nu}, but I think the way the dimensions work is each field's dimension is added. So:

ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, same as ψ.

σ_{mu nu} is dimensionless, so multiplying by that doesn't change the dimension.

F^{mu nu} has dimension 2.

So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F is (3/2 + 3/2) + 2 = 3 +2 =5. Because each ψ contributes 3/2, and the F contributes 2. So the term has dimension 5.

But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the overall term is κ times (dimension 5). So the equation is [κ] +5 =4, so [κ] = -1. So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Okay, so that's the first part. Now the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the interaction term's dimension. The interaction term is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. The dimension of the coupling κ is -1, which implies that the term is of higher dimension. Wait, wait. Wait, the coupling's dimension is [κ] = -1. Wait, but in four dimensions, renormalizable theories require that the coupling constants have non-negative mass dimension. Because, I think, the dimension of the coupling is given by [g] = d - (sum of fields' dimensions) + (terms from other factors?), or maybe more accurately, the interaction term is part of the Lagrangian which has dimension 4.

Wait, the interaction term is L = κ term, where term has dimension 5 (as we saw). So [κ] is -1. So for a renormalizable theory, the dimension of the coupling should be ≥ 0. Because higher-dimensional operators (like dimension 5) are non-renormalizable.

So because [κ] is negative, the theory is not renormalizable.

Wait, but let me make sure. The general rule is that a term in the Lagrangian has dimension 4. So the product of the coupling and the fields involved should sum to 4. So for an interaction term like L = g ψ ψ ψ, the sum of the fields' dimensions is 3*(3/2) =9/2. So [g] should be 4 - 9/2 = -1/2. So if [g] is negative, the term is non-renormalizable.

In this case, our interaction term has [κ] = -1, which is more negative than that example. So the theory is non-renormalizable.

So putting it together: [κ]_M is -1, the theory is not renormalizable. Looking at the options, option C says [κ]=-1 and theory not renormalizable. Option A says it's -1 and renormalizable, which can't be right. Option D says [κ]=1 and not renormalizable, which would be wrong because [κ] is negative. So option C is the correct one.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu] \).

### Step 1: Mass dimension of the fields
- The Dirac spinor \( \psi \) has mass dimension \( \frac{3}{2} \).
- The field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension \( 2 \), as it is derived from the gauge field \( A_\mu \), which has mass dimension \( 1 \).
- The \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) tensor is constructed from the commutator of dimensionless gamma matrices \( \gamma_\mu \), so it is dimensionless.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of the interaction term
The interaction term \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) has the following contributions:
- \( \bar{\psi} \) and \( \psi \) each contribute \( \frac{3}{2} \), so \( \bar{\psi} \psi \) contributes \( \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3 \).
- \( F^{\mu\nu} \) contributes \( 2 \).
- \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is dimensionless.

Thus, the total mass dimension of the interaction term is:
\[
[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}] = 3 + 2 = 5.
\]

### Step 3: Mass dimension of \( \kappa \)
The Lagrangian density must have mass dimension \( 4 \) in four spacetime dimensions. Since the interaction term has mass dimension \( 5 \), the coupling constant \( \kappa \) must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 4: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Here, \( [\kappa] = -1 \), which is negative. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is \( -1 \), and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to **Option C**.
