Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but I'll try to remember.

First, I need to figure out what the starting material looks like. 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, what's the "d" stand for? Oh right, I think in IUPAC nomenclature, the "d" indicates a deuterium substitution. So, it's a benzene ring with a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. Or maybe the other way around? No, position 1 is the first substituent, so bromine is at position 1, deuterium at position 2. So the structure is a benzene ring with Br on carbon 1 and D on carbon 2.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. In aromatic chemistry, it's sometimes used for deprotonation or for elimination to form rings with more unsaturation.

Wait, benzene is already aromatic and stable. So, what kind of reaction would NaNH2 induce here? Oh, maybe it's about elimination. If there's a hydrogen adjacent to a leaving group, perhaps a dehydrohalogenation could occur, forming a double bond or a ring expansion? But in benzene, all the carbons are spÂ² hybridized, so maybe it's about removing a proton and forming a diradical or something else?

Alternatively, I'm thinking of the possibility of dehydrohalogenation leading to a benzene ring with a double bond. But benzene is already a conjugated system. Wait, maybe it's a benzyne formation? I remember that when certain dihalobenzenes react with strong bases like NaNH2, they can lose two equivalents of HX to form a triple bond, creating a benzyne intermediate.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So, only one halide and a deuterium adjacent. So, can the base abstract a proton adjacent to the bromine? Let me think. The bromine is at position 1, the deuterium is at position 2. So, position 2 is next to position 1. If the base abstracts a proton from position 2, but wait, that's where the D is. So maybe that's not possible.

Wait, no, because the D is at position 2. So the adjacent positions would be position 3 and perhaps position 6, but wait, in benzene, each carbon is connected to two others. So position 1 is connected to 2 and 6. Position 2 is connected to 1 and 3. But in the starting material, position 2 has a D instead of H. So when the base comes in, which positions can it abstract a proton from?

So the molecule is Br at C1, D at C2. The adjacent positions to Br are C2 and C6. C2 has a D, so it can't lose a proton there. So the base would abstract a proton from C6, perhaps? Or maybe from another position.

Wait, but for elimination, the H that's abstracted must be anti to the leaving group. Oh, but wait, in aromatic systems, the concept of anti is a bit different. Or perhaps, the base abstracts a proton that's meta to the Br? No, elimination usually requires the H and leaving group to be on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but in benzene, with substituents in adjacent positions, maybe the base can abstract a proton that's on the adjacent carbon (but in our case, the adjacent is D, not H). So that's not possible. Wait, maybe the base can abstract a proton from a position that's adjacent to the position next to Br. Let me visualize the benzene ring.

Imagine the ring with Br at position 1. Then position 2 is next to it, but has D. So the positions adjacent to Br are 2 and 6. Position 2 has D, so no H. So the only position that can lose H adjacent to Br is position 6. So if the base NaNH2 abstracts a proton from position 6, that's adjacent to position 1 (Br), and then elimination would occur, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2? But wait, position 2 has D, not H. So perhaps the mechanism is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzynelike intermediate but with a deuterium. Maybe the deuterium is in a position that affects the elimination.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the reaction isn't elimination but deprotonation. But deprotonating where? If the base abstracts a H from position 3 or 4 or 5, but I'm not sure how that would help form a new product.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution. But in aromatic substitution, such as SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution), you typically need a good leaving group and activating groups. Bromine is a meta director, but the ring is deactivating. So without strong activating groups, SNAr might not proceed unless under high-temperature conditions or with a very strong base.

Wait, but perhaps the base is causing elimination, forming a ring contraction or expansion. Another thought: when a dihalobenzene loses two X groups, it can form a triple bond (like benzyne). But in this case, we have only one Br and one D, so perhaps losing H and Br.

Wait, if the base removes a proton from position 2, but it's a D there. Oh, right, because the position is deuterated, that might complicate things. Or perhaps the base abstracts a different proton.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure again. The molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So, the Br is on C1, D on C2. The positions around are C3, C4, C5, and C6.

Wait, maybe the base abstracts a proton from C3. But C3 is not adjacent to Br. Hmm, but in benzene, all positions are connected through conjugation, so perhaps the base can abstract a proton that's not directly adjacent but part of the ring's structure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the possible products. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

If the reaction is elimination, perhaps we form a ring with a double bond, but in benzene, that's already all double bonds. Alternatively, perhaps the ring opens and forms something else. No, that's unlikely.

Wait, another angle. When NaNH2 is used in ammonia, it's a strong base and can abstract protons in dehydrohalogenation. So, in this case, perhaps the Br leaves, and a proton is abstracted from an adjacent carbon, leading to the formation of a triple bond. But only if we can lose two substituents.

Wait, but in this case, we have a Br and a D adjacent. So, maybe the Br leaves as Br-, and the base abstracts a H from position 6 (next to C1), which is adjacent to C1. Then, a double bond forms between C1 and C6, C6 and C5 would form a double bond as well? Wait, but in benzene, all the bonds are delocalized. So perhaps this is a case where the ring becomes more unsaturated, but that's not possible because benzene is already maximally unsaturated.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a benzynelike structure, which is a triple bond in the ring. But to form benzyne, you typically need two leaving groups, right? Like 1,2-dihalobenzenes. In that case, eliminating two X groups gives a triple bond.

But in our case, we have only one Br and a D. So perhaps the D is not a leaving group but a hydrogen. Wait, D is a deuterium; it's a heavier isotope of hydrogen but doesn't leave easily. So, perhaps the reaction is a single elimination, removing H and Br.

Wait, but for benzyne, you need two adjacent leaving groups. So without that, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed as elimination. So perhaps this starting material doesn't undergo elimination, meaning no product. But the options don't include zero.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. So if the Br is replaced by something else. But the solvent is ammonia, so maybe the NH2- is a nucleophile. But in aromatic substitution, that's typically tough for a meta director like Br. Unless it's in a strongly activating group, but Br is deactivating. So perhaps the substitution isn't feasible here without some assistance.

Alternatively, maybe the base is deprotonating a position adjacent to Br to form a benzynes-like intermediate, but only if there's a second leaving group. Without that, maybe only one possibility occurs or none. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to the formation of a triple bond, but I'm not sure how that would work with only one leaving group. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe the molecule is more accurately 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So when NaNH2 is added, perhaps the base abstracts the D from position 2 as a leaving group? But D is not a good leaving group. Wait, no, because D is a protium isotope; it's not a leaving group unless in a very specific condition.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton elsewhere. Let's say the base abstracts a proton from position 3. Then, the leaving of Br from position 1 and the elimination of H from position 3 would form a double bond between C1 and C2, but that's where the D is. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, but the question says "how many possible organic products", so perhaps it's about isomers formed.

Wait, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of ortho, meta, or para substituted products? Or perhaps the D affects the product in some way.

Wait, another thought: since the starting material has a D on position 2, when a proton is abstracted from position 3 or 6, the resulting ring might have different hydrogen/deuterium arrangements, leading to different products.

Wait, but I'm not exactly clear. Let me think again about the reaction mechanism. NaNH2 is a strong base, so it abstracts protons. If the Br is at position 1, and D at position 2, the base would abstract a proton from a position that's adjacent to Br, but position 2 is D, so that's not possible. So the base would have to abstract a proton from position 6, which is adjacent to position 1 (Br). So, the base takes a proton from position 6, which is next to Br. Then, Br leaves as Br-.

Wait, so elimination occurs between C1 and C6. So forming a double bond between C1 and C6, but wait, that's already a double bond in the aromatic ring. So this doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the ring becomes a triple bond, but that would require elimination of two substituents.

Wait, perhaps the initial step is the abstraction of a proton leading to the formation of a benzynes intermediate. But with only one Br, maybe it's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, but the question implies a reaction occurs.

Alternatively, maybe the deuterium doesn't affect the reaction, and the product is the same as if it were a hydrogen. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: when the base abstracts a proton from position 6, which is adjacent to position 1 (Br), then the Br and the H from position 6 are eliminated, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. But wait, position 2 has D, so perhaps the product becomes a ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, and a D on C2.

But wait, that would produce a ring with a double bond between C1 and C2. But in benzene, all double bonds are conjugated, so this might not change anything structurally, but the substitution pattern would change. Alternatively, perhaps the ring forms a triple bond, like a benzyne, but with only one leaving group, that's not possible.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the possible products. If the reaction forms a triple bond, but that requires two leaving groups, which we don't have. So perhaps no reaction occurs. But that would mean zero products, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is a good leaving group. But I don't think so. D is more stable as a bond due to lower zero-point energy, but it's not typically a leaving group.

Wait, another possibility: the base abstracts a proton from position 3. So position 3 is two away from Br. Then, elimination would form a double bond between C3 and C4? But that doesn't seem to relate directly to Br.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where Br is replaced by NH2-. But for that to happen in an aromatic ring, the ring must be activated. Since Br is deactivating, unless under very forcing conditions, but NaNH2 is a strong base. I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: when NaNH2 is used in condensed ammonia, it's a method for dehydrohalogenation to form alkyne bonds. So if the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, perhaps the reaction abstracts a proton from position 2 (but it's D, so that's not possible), or from another position.

Wait, perhaps the deuterium is in the ortho position relative to Br, so the base could abstract a proton from the para position? No, position 4 is para to position 1. Or maybe the base abstracts a proton from position 3, making the adjacent double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's not one of the options. The options are 1,2,3,4. So maybe there are two possible products.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a meta and para product. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to two different isomers because of the D's position.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of benzynes. Wait, but without a second leaving group, that's impossible. So maybe the reaction doesn't proceed. But that's not an option.

Another angle: perhaps the D is replaced by a H in the product. But that would require some kind of substitution, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a simple elimination, forming a ring with a double bond, but I don't think that's possible.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress. Let me try to look for similar reactions I know. Oh! The formation of benzyne typically requires 1,2-dihalobenzenes. When treated with a strong base like NaNH2, they lose two X groups to form a triple bond. But in this case, we have only one Br and a D next to it.

Wait, but D isn't a halogen. So perhaps the base can abstract a proton adjacent to Br, leading to a single elimination. But then, only one H is removed, so perhaps the product is a ring with a double bond. But again, benzene is already fully unsaturated.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but the problem implies it does. Alternatively, maybe the D doesn't interfere, and the product is the same as if the D wasn't there, leading to the same number of products.

Wait, another thought: in the reaction, the base abstracts a proton from position 6 (adjacent to Br at position 1), leading to the elimination of Br and forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. But wait, position 2 has a D, so maybe the triple bond is between C1 and C2 with D on C2. But I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is replaced by another group, but without a leaving group, that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't occur, but that's not one of the options. So maybe I should think about the possibility that the D is not affecting the reaction, and the product is the same as 1-bromo benzene treated with NaNH2.

Wait, if the starting material were 1-bromo benzene, treating with NaNH2 in ammonia would likely lead to elimination, forming benzyne. But that requires another leaving group. So without it, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but again, the question suggests a reaction occurs.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that the D is in position 2, and the base abstracts a proton from position 3. Then elimination would form a double bond between C3 and C4. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms two different products based on the position where the deuterium is.

Wait, maybe the reaction produces a diradical, leading to different products based on where the electrons are. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the deuterium affects the reaction's stereochemistry, but I don't see how that would increase the number of products.

Wait, another thought: the base could abstract protons from either side of the ring, leading to different products. For example, if the base abstracts a proton from position 6 or position 4, leading to different positions for the resulting double bond. But as benzene is symmetric, perhaps the products are the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the D at position 2 leads to two possible products, depending on where the elimination occurs. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of ortho, meta, and para products. But that would require substitution, which I'm not sure about.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find the straightforward approach. The reaction is 1-bromo-2-d benzene with NaNH2 in NH3. What's the product?

Wait, I think the correct reaction is that NaNH2 abstracts a proton adjacent to the bromine, leading to elimination of H and Br, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2, creating a benzyne intermediate. But wait, in this case, position 2 has a D, not H. So the base can't abstract a proton from position 2. So where can it abstract a proton from?

Ah, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 6, which is adjacent to position 1 (Br). So eliminating H from position 6 and Br from position 1 would form a triple bond between C1 and C6. Wait, but in benzene, each carbon is connected to two others. So if the triple bond is between C1 and C6, that would create a ring with a triple bond, which is benzyne. But the starting material has a D at position 2, which is adjacent to position 1. So this may affect the structure.

Wait, but if the triple bond forms between C1 and C6, then the adjacent positions (C2 and C5) would have what substituents? C2 has D, and C5 would be H. So the structure would be a triple bond between C1 and C6, with D at C2.

But how many possible products would this lead to? If the triple bond can form in more than one position, but in this case, with Br at position 1 and D at position 2, the only possible elimination is between C1 and C6, leading to a single product. But wait, the reaction could form two different benzyne isomers depending on the positions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the deuterium leads to two different products, but I don't see how.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could form two different products based on the position of the deuterium. For example, the D could be at position 2, which could be either ortho or para to the elimination site, leading to different products. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form any product, but the question implies it does.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. The options are 1,2,3,4. Let me think: if the reaction forms a single product, then the answer is B)1. But if more than one product is formed, then it's another option.

Wait, another angle: the D is a heavy isotope, which can influence the reaction's outcome. But in this case, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the compound can form two different products based on the position of the D. For example, if the D is on C2, the reaction could lead to either a meta or para product, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. The correct reaction is that the base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, leading to elimination and the formation of benzyne. But since the D is in the adjacent position, the H can only be abstracted from position 6, leading to a single product. So the number of possible products is 1.

Wait, but wait. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene, when you eliminate H from position 6 and Br from position 1, you form a triple bond between C1 and C6. The D is on C2, which is adjacent to C1. So the benzyne would have the D on C2. But benzyne is a symmetric molecule, so the position of the D would not change the structure. So the product is a single benzyne with D in a specific position, leading to only one product.

Therefore, the number of possible organic products is 1. So the answer is B)1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNHâ in condensed ammonia. The starting material is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom at position 2. NaNHâ is a strong base, commonly used for dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. 

In this case, the bromine at position 1 is the leaving group, and the base abstracts a proton from a position adjacent to the bromine. However, position 2, which is adjacent to position 1, contains a deuterium (D) instead of a proton, making it unavailable for abstraction. Therefore, the base must abstract a proton from position 6, which is also adjacent to position 1. This elimination leads to the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6, creating a benzyne intermediate.

The benzyne intermediate is symmetric, and the presence of the deuterium at position 2 does not affect the symmetry or the number of possible products. Since the reaction proceeds through a single elimination pathway, only one product is formed. Thus, the number of possible organic products is 1.
