Okay, so I've got this question about general relativity or differential geometry, I think. The question is about finding the area of a pseudosphere with a given metric. Hmm. Let's try to break this down step by step.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that's interesting. The denominator is 4 - x² - y², so that's 4 minus r squared, where r is the radial coordinate in 2D, right? Because x² + y² = r², so 4 - r². Oh wait, but the metric is written in terms of dx and dy, so maybe it's in 2D space? Or is it a higher dimension? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question mentions a pseudosphere. A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? So I think this is a 2-dimensional metric embedded in a higher-dimensional space, but for the purposes of area, maybe we just consider the 2D surface.

Wait, no, the metric is for a 2D surface because there are only dx and dy terms. So the space described by this metric is 2D. So the area would be the area of this 2D surface.

But wait, the question says "the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2." So pseudosphere has radius 2, which probably ties into the metric. Let me think about what a pseudosphere's metric looks like.

I remember that the metric for a pseudosphere (which is a surface with constant negative curvature) in Poincaré coordinates is usually written as ds² = dr² + (a² / cosh²(r/a)) dθ², where a is the radius of curvature. But wait, in that case, the metric depends on r and θ. Our given metric here only has x and y, but maybe it's expressed in Cartesian coordinates instead of polar.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is expressed in terms of x and y, where x² + y² = r². So maybe it's better to switch to polar coordinates to see if this makes sense.

Let me compute the area of a surface given a metric. The area is the integral over the surface of the square root determinant of the metric tensor. Wait, no, for a 2D metric, the area element is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. So I need to compute the determinant of the metric tensor and integrate over x and y.

The given metric is written as ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So the metric tensor components are g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), g_yy = same as g_xx, and g_xy = 0. So the metric is diagonal.

The determinant of the metric tensor g is g_xx * g_yy, since the off-diagonal terms are zero. So det(g) = [32/(4 - r²)]², where r² = x² + y². Therefore, the area element is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. Wait, no, the area element is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. Because for a 2D metric, the square root of the determinant gives the area scaling factor.

So sqrt(det(g)) = sqrt( [32/(4 - r²)]² ) = 32/(4 - r²). Because 4 - r² is positive in the region we're considering, I suppose. The denominator can't be zero or negative, so 4 - r² >0 → r <2. So the region is a disk of radius 2 in x-y space.

Wait, but the area would be integrating over the region where 4 - x² - y² >0. So the limits of integration for r are from 0 to 2. So the area is the integral over r from 0 to 2 and θ from 0 to 2π of the area element.

Expressed in polar coordinates, dx dy = r dr dθ. So the area becomes:

Area = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute this integral. First, the integral over θ is straightforward—each term is multiplied by 2π. So:

Area = 2π * ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Hmm, let's compute that integral. Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → - (du/2) = r dr. So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So substituting:

∫ [32 r dr/(4 - r²)] = 32 ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ].

Which becomes (32 / (-2)) ∫ (du/u) from u=4 to u=0.

Wait, the limits change: when r goes from 0 to 2, u goes from 4 to 0. So the integral becomes:

32 * (-1/2) ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u) du.

Which is:

-16 ∫ (4 to 0) du/u = -16 [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0.

But integrating from 4 to 0 is the same as integrating from 0 to 4 with a negative sign. So:

-16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

Wait, but ln(0) is negative infinity. So this integral becomes -16 [ (-infty) - ln(4) ] = -16 [ -infty - ln(4) ] → positive infinity.

Wait, this suggests that the integral diverges. So the area is infinite. But that can't be right, because a pseudosphere should have finite area. Or wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the pseudosphere is a surface with finite area? I thought the area of a pseudosphere is 4π a², similar to a sphere in Euclidean space. But perhaps in this metric, the area is different.

Wait, perhaps the metric corresponds to an infinite area. Let me think again. The integral we're computing is ∫ (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2. Wait, but wait, when r approaches 2 from below, the denominator approaches zero, and the integrand behaves like 32 r / (4 - r²) ≈ 32*2/(4 - (2 - ε)^2) = 64/(4 - (4 -4ε + ε²)) ) → 64/(4ε) → 16/ε. So as ε approaches zero, the integrand approaches infinity. So the integral is improper and may diverge.

Wait, let me compute the integral again:

Compute ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me do the substitution again. Let u = 4 - r², du = -2 r dr → r dr = - du/2.

So the integral becomes:

32 ∫ [ r dr/(4 - r²) ) ] = 32 ∫ ( (-du/2) / u ) )

= -16 ∫ (du/u) from u=4 to u=0.

= -16 [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0.

= -16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ) ]

But ln(0) is -infinity, so this becomes:

-16 [ (-inf) - ln(4) ) ] = -16 * (-inf - ln4) ) = ∞.

So the integral diverges to infinity. Thus, the area is infinite.

But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. I thought pseudospheres have finite area.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the metric. Let me think again. The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So in polar coordinates, ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] r² dr² + [32/(4 - r²)] r² dθ²? Wait, no. Wait, in polar coordinates, dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². So the metric would be:

ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ² )

So the metric tensor components are g_rr = 32/(4 - r²), g_θθ = 32 r²/(4 - r²), and g_rθ = 0.

The determinant of the metric is g_rr * g_θθ - (g_rθ)^2 = [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] = (32)^2 r²/(4 - r²)^2.

The square root of the determinant is sqrt(g) = 32 r/(4 - r²).

So the area element is sqrt(g) dr dθ = [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

So the total area is the integral from r=0 to r=2, and θ=0 to θ=2π, of that expression.

So Area = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Which is 2π * ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Which is the same as before. So the integral is:

2π * [ -16 ln(4 - r²) ) evaluated from 0 to 2 ]

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute the integral ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me make substitution u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = - du/2.

So ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr = 32 ∫ [ (r dr) / (4 - r²) ) ] = 32 ∫ [ (- du/2) / u ) ].

= -16 ∫ (du/u ) = -16 ln|u| + C = -16 ln(4 - r²) + C.

So the definite integral from 0 to 2 is:

[ -16 ln(4 - (2)^2) ] - [ -16 ln(4 - 0^2) ) ]

= [ -16 ln(0) ] - [ -16 ln(4) )

ln(0) is -infinity, so -16 * (-infty) is positive infinity.

So the integral is from 0 to 2 of [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr is divergent, it goes to infinity. So the area computed is infinite.

So the area is infinite. Looking at the options, option D is +infty.

Wait, but pseudospheres have finite area. Oh, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the metric. Alternatively, perhaps the given metric doesn't correspond to a pseudosphere but something else.

Wait, let me think again about the properties of the metric. The line element is ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²). So this is similar to a metric of negative curvature.

Wait, the general form for a metric of constant curvature in 2D is ds² = dr² + (a^2 / cosh²(r/a)) dθ² for positive curvature, or ds² = dr² + (a^2 sinh²(r/a)) dθ² for negative curvature. Wait, wait, no. Let me think. For a sphere (positive curvature), the metric in polar coordinates is ds² = dr² + (a² sin²(r/a)) dθ². For a pseudosphere (negative curvature), the metric is ds² = dr² + (a^2 sinh²(r/a)) dθ². But the given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ² ). So that's the same as (32/(4 - r²)) dr² + (32 r²/(4 - r²)) dθ². Comparing to the pseudosphere metric, which has (a^2 sinh²(r/a)) for the θ-component.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a metric for a hyperbolic space, but it's written in Poincaré coordinates. The Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic space has the metric ds² = [4/(1 + (x² + y²)] (dx² + dy²), which is similar but not the same as what we have. Our metric is (32)/(4 - r²) times (dr² + r² dθ²), which can be rewritten as (32)/(4 - r²) dr² + (32 r²)/(4 - r²) dθ².

Wait, so in Poincaré coordinates, the hyperbolic metric is ds² = (4/(1 + r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate. So in that case, the denominator is (1 + r²), but here it's (4 - r²). So perhaps this is a different scaling.

In any case, the area for a hyperbolic disk of radius R (in the Poincaré model) is 2π a² (1 + R), where a is the curvature radius. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the area of a hyperbolic plane is infinite, but a finite hyperbolic disk would have an infinite area as the radius approaches infinity. But in our case, the integral up to r=2 is causing a problem.

Wait, the area in question is the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, perhaps the 'radius' in the pseudosphere refers to the maximum possible r, i.e., the radius in the Poincaré disk model is 2. So in this case, the area would be the area of the hyperbolic disk with radius 2.

But earlier calculation shows that the integral diverges, so the area is infinite. So option D.

Wait, but wait, another thought: perhaps the given metric is not for a pseudosphere but for something else. Alternatively, maybe the denominator is 4 - r², which for r² <4, so r <2. If r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, and the area element becomes infinite. So the region is a disk of radius 2, but the area integral diverges, so the total area is infinite. Therefore, the correct answer is D, +infty.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This describes a 2D surface embedded in a higher-dimensional space. To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we use the area element for a 2D metric, which is \( \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy \), where \( \det(g) \) is the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric tensor components are:

\[
g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}, \quad g_{xy} = 0.
\]

The determinant of the metric is:

\[
\det(g) = g_{xx} \cdot g_{yy} = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

In polar coordinates (\( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \)), the area element becomes:

\[
\sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The integral over \( \theta \) is straightforward, yielding \( 2\pi \). The remaining radial integral is:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the integral becomes:

\[
32 \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{-du/2}{u} = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{du}{u}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-16 \left[\ln(u)\right]_4^0 = -16 \left[\ln(0) - \ln(4)\right].
\]

Since \( \ln(0) \to -\infty \), the integral diverges to \( +\infty \). This indicates that the area of the pseudosphere described by this metric is infinite.

Thus, the correct answer is:
