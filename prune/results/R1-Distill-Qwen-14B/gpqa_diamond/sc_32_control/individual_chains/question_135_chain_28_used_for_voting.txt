Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let's see what I can figure out. The question is about the possible decay products of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, but I'm not sure how much that matters for determining the decay modes. Maybe it's just there to tell us what fermions X can interact with.

So, the Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f-bar ψf(y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I misread that. Let me parse it again. Oh, it's written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f-bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that doesn't look quite right. No, probably I'm misinterpreting the typesetting. Maybe it's L(y) = -λ f ψ_f-bar (v + X) ψ_f. So, perhaps it's a Yukawa-like interaction, where the boson X couples to fermions ψ_f with a coupling strength λ. So the interaction term would be something like λ f ψ_f-bar X ψ_f, maybe?

Wait, the actual form might not matter for the decay modes as much as the possible fermions it can decay into. Because the decay products would depend on the mass of X and the masses of the possible fermions it can pair produce.

Given that X is a boson with mass 6 GeV, I need to figure out which fermion pairs can be its decay products. The general rule is that the boson can decay into two particles if their combined mass is less than the mass of the boson. But wait, I think for a spin-0 boson, like the Higgs, the decay products have to be a fermion and its antiparticle, or a pair of bosons, but if it's a spin-1 boson, like a W or Z, it can decay into fermions as well.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify the spin of X. Hmm. Well, regardless, for decay into two particles, each particle and its antiparticle must each have a mass less than X's mass, because each would be at rest in the center-of-momentum frame if possible. But wait, for a decay into two particles, the sum of their masses must be less than or equal to X's mass. Wait, no, that's not right. For a decay into two particles, each particle's mass must be less than or equal to X's mass, because each would have to be produced with some kinetic energy.

Wait, actually, the condition for a particle to decay into two particles is that the sum of the rest masses of the two decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the decaying particle. Because, in the rest frame of X, each decay product would have some kinetic energy if the sum is less than X's mass.

Wait, no, that's not correct. For a decay into two particles, say, particle A and particle B, the combined rest mass must be less than or equal to X's mass. Because, when X is at rest, the two decay products must each have energy greater than their rest mass. So, for the decay to be possible, the sum of their rest masses must be less than or equal to X's mass.

Wait, let me think again. Let's say X is at rest (mass M). It decays into two particles, each with mass m. The invariant mass of the two particles is M. But each particle's energy is (M^2 + m^2 ± 2M m cos(theta)) )^(1/2), but wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think in terms of the threshold condition. The minimum energy required to produce two particles of mass m each is when they are produced at rest relative to each other. So the sum of their rest masses is 2m. So, 2m must be less than or equal to M for the decay to be possible.

Ah, right, that makes sense. So for X to decay into two particles of mass m each, 2m ≤ M.

In this case, M is 6 GeV. So for each fermion pair, I need to check if 2 * m_fermion ≤ 6 GeV.

But wait, if the fermions are heavy, like top quarks, their mass would be too high. But the top quark is about 173 GeV, which is way above 6 GeV, so X can't decay into top quarks. So, which fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV (since 6 GeV /2 =3 GeV)?

Wait, but wait a second, if the fermion is very light, like a lepton or a light quark, then 2m would be much less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into pairs of these particles.

So the possible decay products are any fermion-antifermion pair where each fermion has a mass ≤ 3 GeV.

Wait, but let me get the masses of the standard model fermions:

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV

Quarks:
- Up (u): ~2.2 MeV
- Down (d): ~4.7 MeV
- Strange (s): ~95 MeV
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.7 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV

Wait, but wait, the masses I'm recalling are the current quark masses, which are the masses in the absence of binding energy. But when quarks are confined, like in hadrons, their effective masses are higher. Wait, but in particle physics, when considering decay products, we use the pole mass or the on-shell mass of the particles.

So, for the purpose of decay, the relevant mass is the mass of the fermion. So, for a fermion f, if m_f is less than M/2, then X can decay into f and f-bar.

So, let's list the fermions and their masses.

Leptons:
e: ~0.511 MeV → 0.000511 GeV → 2m_e = 0.001 GeV << 6 GeV. So X can decay into e+ e-.

μ: ~0.1057 GeV → 2m_mu ≈ 0.211 GeV <<6 GeV. So μ+ μ- is allowed.

τ: ~1.78 GeV → 2m_tau ≈ 3.56 GeV. Wait, 3.56 GeV is greater than 6 GeV? No, 3.56 GeV is less than 6 GeV? No, 3.56 is less than 6, right? Wait, no. 3.56 GeV is less than 6 GeV. Wait, 3.56 is less than 6 → yes. So 2m_tau = ~3.56 GeV, which is less than X's mass (6 GeV). So tau pairs are allowed.

Quarks:
u: ~2.2 MeV → 0.0022 GeV → 2m_u=0.0044 GeV <<6.

d: ~4.7 MeV → 0.0047 GeV → 2m_d=0.0094 GeV <<6.

s: ~95 MeV → 0.095 GeV → 2m_s=0.19 GeV ≈ 0.19 GeV <<6.

c: ~1.5 GeV → 2m_c=3 GeV. So 3 GeV is exactly half of X's mass (6 GeV). So X can decay into c c-bar.

b: ~4.7 GeV → 2m_b=9.4 GeV. Which is greater than X's mass of 6 GeV. So b quarks are too heavy; X cannot decay into b b-bar.

t: way too heavy, as discussed earlier.

So, X can decay into any of the following pairs:

- e+ e-
- μ+ μ-
- τ+ τ- (since 2m_tau ≈3.56 GeV <6 GeV)
- u u-bar
- d d-bar
- s s-bar
- c c-bar

But wait, what about the quarks like charm? Because m_c is about 1.5 GeV. So 2m_c=3 GeV which is exactly 6 GeV/2. So yes, decay into c c-bar is allowed.

Wait, but wait a second. The mass of the c quark is about 1.5 GeV, but when it's produced in a pair, the pair's combined mass is 3 GeV. Which is exactly the threshold, so X can decay into c c-bar.

So the possible decay modes include all these fermion pairs.

Now, looking at the options.

Option A: X→ b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

But wait, X can't decay into b b-bar because 2m_b = 9.4 GeV >6 GeV. So option A is incorrect because it includes b b-bar.

Option B: X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

That's correct because all the 2m_f are ≤6 GeV. So this includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Option C: X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, t t-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

No, because t is too heavy. So C is incorrect.

Option D: X→ b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Again, includes b which is too heavy.

So the correct option should be option B.

Wait, but wait, why does option B have c c-bar and option A doesn't? Because in option A, the allowed pairs are the lighter ones plus tau, but not c. So option B includes all the possible decay channels except those involving b and t.

So the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we analyze the possible fermion-antifermion pairs it can decay into. The general rule is that a boson of mass \( M \) can decay into a pair of particles if the combined rest mass of the pair is less than or equal to \( M \). For a boson decaying into two fermions \( f \) and \( \bar{f} \), this requires \( 2m_f \leq M \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion.
