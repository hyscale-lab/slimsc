Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about a bosonic field X interacting with fermions. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). The mass of X is 6 GeV, and we're supposed to figure out its allowed decay channels at the lowest order.

First, I remember that bosons can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if the mass of the boson is at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because in particle physics, the decay process must conserve energy, so the rest mass of the boson has to be enough to produce the pair.

Looking at the Lagrangian, it seems like X couples to fermions f. The interaction term is λ f ψ̄_f X ψ_f, I think. So the coupling is present for any fermion f, as long as the Yukawa coupling λ exists for that fermion.

So the possible decays would be X → f f̄ for any fermion f that X can interact with. But wait, the question is about which fermions are kinematically allowed. So we need to check the masses of the fermions.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify all the fermions that X couples to. Hmm. Wait, the Lagrangian is written as -λ f ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. So X couples to any fermion f that has a Yukawa coupling λ f. So all fermions are possible? Or are we to assume that the coupling exists only for certain fermions?

Wait, I think in the standard model, the Higgs (which is a boson) couples to all fermions, but in this case, the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we have to assume that X can couple to any fermion, but whether they can decay depends on the mass.

But wait, the problem says to look at the kinematically allowed decays. So the mass of X is 6 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV (since 2m_f must be ≤ m_X) can be produced.

Wait, but what are the masses of the known fermions?

Electron (e⁻): ~0.0005 GeV
Muon (μ⁻): ~0.105 GeV
Tau (τ⁻): ~1.777 GeV
Quarks: Up and down are light, but their masses are like a few MeV. The heavier ones are the top quark, which is about 173 GeV, but that's way higher. The others are charm (c) about 1.27 GeV, strange (s) about 95 MeV, bottom (b) about 4.1 GeV.

Wait, wait. Let me get the masses right. The quark masses are a bit tricky because they're current masses and depend on the scheme, but approximate values:

u: ~2 MeV
d: ~4 MeV
s: ~95 MeV
c: ~1.27 GeV
b: ~4.1 GeV
t: ~173 GeV

Leptons:

e: ~0.0005 GeV
mu: ~0.105 GeV
tau: ~1.777 GeV

So for X mass 6 GeV, the possible fermion pairs would be those where 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV.

Let's see:

Electron: 2m_e ≈ 0.001 GeV → allowed.

Same for muon: 2m_mu ≈ 0.21 GeV → allowed.

Tau: 2m_tau ≈ 3.55 GeV → allowed? Wait, 6 GeV is more than 3.55, so yes.

Quarks:

u: 2m_u ~ 4 MeV → allowed.

d: 2m_d ~8 MeV → allowed.

s: 2m_s ~190 MeV → allowed.

c: 2m_c ~2.54 GeV → 6 GeV is larger, so allowed.

b: 2m_b ~8.2 GeV → 6 GeV is less than 8.2 GeV. So not allowed. So X cannot decay into b bbar because 2m_b is bigger than m_X.

Top quark: way too heavy, 346 GeV, so no way.

So possible fermions that can be produced in pairs would be:

e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but also the charged leptons and quarks. Since X is a scalar (probably), it can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair as long as the mass condition is met.

So the possible decay channels are:

X → e+ e-
X → μ+ μ-
X → τ+ τ-
X → u ū
X → d d̄
X → s s̄
X → c c̄

Wait, but what about charged particles? Like, can X decay into, say, u and anti-u? Yes, because they are neutral overall. But for leptons, they are charged, but in pairs, so it's neutral as well.

Now looking at the options.

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but 2m_b is 8.2 GeV, which is higher than 6 GeV, so X can't decay into b bbar. So option A includes b, which isn't allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

That includes c. Because 2m_c is about 2.5 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So that's allowed.

So B includes all the allowed leptons and quarks except for b and t, which are too heavy.

Option C: Includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But wait, t is way too heavy. So X can't decay into t tbar. So C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Again, includes b, which isn't allowed. So D is incorrect.

So the correct option is B.

Wait, but wait. Let me check: the mass of the X is 6 GeV. So for each fermion pair:

- e: 2 * 0.0005 = 0.001 GeV ≤6 → allowed
- mu: 2*0.105=0.21 GeV → allowed
- tau: 2*1.777=3.554 → allowed
- u: 2*2=4 MeV → allowed
- d: 2*4=8 MeV → allowed
- s: 2*95=190 MeV → allowed
- c: 2*1.27=2.54 GeV → allowed
- b: 2*4.1=8.2 GeV → not allowed (since 8.2>6)
- t: way over.

So all these except b can decay. So the decay products in the options should include e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Looking at the options:

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Yes, all allowed, except for b. So option B is correct.

Wait, but wait. The problem statement says "the interaction is given by..." So perhaps X only couples to certain fermions. Because the Lagrangian has a general term, but maybe in the model, X only couples to some subset of fermions.

Hmm, the problem doesn't specify which fermions X couples to. It just shows the interaction term as involving fermions f. So I think we should assume that X can couple to all possible fermions. But in reality, without knowing which fermions have a coupling, you can't be certain. But the problem's options suggest that in the correct answer, X decays into various pairs, so perhaps the assumption is that X can couple to all.

Wait, but perhaps the presence of the interaction term implies that X couples to all fermions f. So the possible decays are any where 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So with that, then the allowed fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c. So the decay options should include all these.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So yes, all of them. So B includes all except the bottom and top, which are too heavy.

So the correct answer must be option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction term in the Lagrangian, \(-\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f (y) (v + X(y)) \psi_f(y)\), indicates that \( X \) couples to fermions \( f \). For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the mass of \( X \) must be at least twice the mass of the fermion \( f \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq m_X \).

### Step 1: Analyze the fermion masses
The approximate masses of fermions are:
- \( e^- \): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( \mu^- \): \( \sim 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( \tau^- \): \( \sim 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( u \): \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( d \): \( \sim 4 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( s \): \( \sim 95 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( c \): \( \sim 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( b \): \( \sim 4.1 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( t \): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

For \( X \) with \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), the condition \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) allows the following fermions:
- \( e^- \), \( \mu^- \), \( \tau^- \), \( u \), \( d \), \( s \), \( c \) (since \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) for these particles).
- \( b \) and \( t \) are excluded because \( 2m_b \sim 8.2 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 2m_t \sim 346 \, \text{GeV} \), both exceeding \( m_X \).

### Step 2: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: Includes \( X \to b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > m_X \). Hence, A is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \). All these decays are allowed, so B is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( X \to t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_t > m_X \). Hence, C is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( X \to b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > m_X \). Hence, D is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) based on the given mass and interaction term.
