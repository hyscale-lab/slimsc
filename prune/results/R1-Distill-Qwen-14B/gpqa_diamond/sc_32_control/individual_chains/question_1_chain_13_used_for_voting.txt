Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question says that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A through D.

Hmm, I remember something about lifetimes and energy differences in quantum mechanics. Oh right, it's related to the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties can be known. Specifically, the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is greater than or equal to h/(4π), where h is the Planck constant.

So, ΔE * Δt ≥ h/(4π). Here, Δt would be the lifetime of the state, I think. Because the lifetime is how long the state exists before decaying, right? So the uncertainty in time is about that lifetime. So if the lifetime is longer, the uncertainty in energy is smaller, which means the energy can be measured more precisely.

Wait, the problem is about distinguishing two energy levels. So the energy difference should be much larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. But wait, which state's uncertainty are we considering? Or perhaps, the energy difference should be such that each state's energy uncertainty is small enough that their separation is clear.

Wait, maybe I should think about the uncertainty in energy for each state. Each state has its own lifetime, so each has its own ΔE.

Let me compute ΔE for each state.

First, compute the uncertainty in energy for each lifetime. The formula is ΔE ≈ ħ / (Δt), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is h/(2π). So ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Wait, but sometimes the uncertainty is written as ΔE ≥ ħ/(2Δt), depending on the exact formulation. Hmm, I might need to look that up, but I think the approximate formula is ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt for an order of magnitude calculation.

So for each state, let's compute ΔE.

First state: lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 seconds.

ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J.

But wait, the problem uses eV as units, so I need to convert this into electron volts.

I remember that 1 eV is approximately 1.602176634e-19 joules. So to convert from J to eV, I divide by that number.

So ΔE1 in eV = (1.0545718e-25 J) / (1.602176634e-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

1e-25 / 1.6e-19 = (1 / 1.6) * 1e-6 = 0.625e-6 = 6.25e-7 eV.

Wait, actually, 1e-25 / 1.6e-19 = (1e-25)/(1.6e-19) = (1/1.6) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.625e-6 = 6.25e-7 eV.

So ΔE1 ≈ 6.25e-7 eV.

Similarly for the second state: τ2 = 1e-8 seconds.

ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (1.05e-34) / (1e-8) = 1.05e-26 J.

Convert to eV: (1.05e-26) / 1.6e-19 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait, 1e-26 / 1.6e-19 = (1/1.6) * 1e-7 = 0.625e-7 = 6.25e-8 eV.

So ΔE2 is about 6.25e-8 eV.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference should be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties, I think. Because each has an uncertainty, and if the separation is bigger than both, they are resolvable.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference just needs to be larger than the uncertainty of the measurement. Because if the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty, then you can observe a clear separation.

Wait, but each state's energy has an uncertainty. So when you measure E1 and E2, you can't be sure exactly what each is, but if E2 - E1 is much larger than their uncertainties, you can tell they are different.

Wait, perhaps it's more about the resolving power in an experiment. The resolving power ΔE_res is proportional to the reciprocal of the time available. Or maybe the energy difference must be at least of the order of the uncertainty in energy. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the minimum energy difference that can be resolved is on the order of the uncertainty in energy. So for each state, the uncertainty is about ħ/τ, so the energy difference must be larger than that to be distinguishable.

Wait, but in the case of two states, perhaps the total uncertainty in their energies would affect their distinguishability. Let me think about it.

Suppose we have two states, each with their own uncertainty in energy. To resolve them, the energy difference between them (ΔE) should be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because if ΔE is much larger than each uncertainty, then each peak in the energy spectrum would be well-separated.

Wait, yes, I think that's the case. So for two states, the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1 should be greater than the sum of their individual ΔE1 and ΔE2.

So ΔE ≥ ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Because if ΔE is bigger than the sum, then the peaks don't overlap. So each peak has a width of about their respective ΔE, so the separation should be more than the sum of the half-widths.

Wait, but in reality, energy levels are often measured in terms of their natural linewidths, which are inversely proportional to their lifetimes. So when we have two lines, the requirement for them to be resolvable is that the separation between them is more than the sum of their half-widths.

So in this case, the energy difference should be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2).

So let's compute that.

ΔE1 ≈ 6.25e-7 eV.

ΔE2 ≈ 6.25e-8 eV.

Adding them together: 6.25e-7 +0.625e-7 = 6.875e-7 eV.

So the energy difference should be greater than approximately 6.875e-7 eV.

Now let's look at the options.

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → much smaller than 6.87e-7. So not enough.

Option B: 1e-11 eV → even smaller, no good.

Option C: 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is bigger than 6.87e-7 (which is 0.000000687 eV). So yes, this is much bigger.

Option D: 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than the required 6.87e-7 eV. So no good.

So the only option that meets the condition is option C, which is 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. The calculation for ΔE1 was approximately 6.25e-7 eV. And ΔE2 is about 6.25e-8 eV. So the sum is about 6.875e-7 eV. So the energy difference needs to be larger than that, which is 6.875e-7 eV.

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV → which is larger than 6.875e-7 eV (which is 0.0000006875 eV).

So yes, option C is the only one that's larger. So the answer must be C.

Wait but wait, I'm a bit confused. Because sometimes when you have two states, perhaps the energy difference just needs to be larger than the individual uncertainties. Or maybe it's the maximum of the two.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in the measurement. Wait, I think the correct approach is to ensure that the energy difference is larger than the sum of the uncertainties. Because each state contributes an uncertainty. So if the separation is larger than the sum of the uncertainties, then the lines don't overlap.

But in reality, I'm not entirely sure. Sometimes, when you have two peaks, the separation is considered resolvable if it's more than about twice the average uncertainty or something like that. But in any case, option C is the only one that is way bigger than the required 6.875e-7 eV.

Wait, let me calculate 6.875e-7 eV in scientific notation. 6.875e-7 eV is 0.6875e-6 eV. Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV = 100e-6 eV. So 1e-4 is much larger than 0.6875e-6.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C.

To distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), their energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties in energy, \( \Delta E_1 \) and \( \Delta E_2 \). These uncertainties are determined by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). The uncertainty in energy for each state is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \Delta E_1 \) and \( \Delta E_2 \)
For the first state with lifetime \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
\]
Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the second state with lifetime \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]
Converting to electron volts:
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the required energy difference
To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is also much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is \( 100 \, \mu\text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This satisfies the condition.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

### Final Answer
The only option that satisfies the condition is **C**.
