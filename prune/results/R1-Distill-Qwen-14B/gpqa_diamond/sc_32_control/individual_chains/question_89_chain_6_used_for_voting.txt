Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slowly because I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through each part.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH to produce a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, let's break this down reaction by reaction.

First Reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH (excess) → product 1.

I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically dehydrohalogenation, to form an alkene. Since adamantane is a highly branched, diamondoid structure, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromines on adjacent carbons. Heating with KOH would likely result in the loss of HBr twice, forming a double bond. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene, I think. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons of the adamantane structure. When KOH is used, each Br would leave, and the adjacent hydrogens would be abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond.

Wait, actually, when you have 1,3-dibromoadamantane, heating with a strong base like KOH would lead to a double elimination. Each Br is on adjacent carbons, so removing H from each and eliminating two HBr molecules would form a double bond. But wait, the positions of the Brs are 1 and 3 on the adamantane ring. Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the two Brs are on adjacent carbons. So when KOH is used, the two Hs adjacent to the Brs are removed, and two HBr molecules are eliminated, forming a double bond between the two carbons where Br was attached. So product 1 would be 1,3-diene or something similar. Wait, but the NMR data for product 1 is given as 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). Also, the IR has an absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which is typical for a carbonyl group (C=O). Wait, that doesn't fit with an alkene. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Because if product 1 is an alkene, the IR shouldn't have a carbonyl peak. So perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but something else.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a substitution reaction. But KOH is a strong base, so elimination is more likely. Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that elimination leads to a carbonyl group. Oh wait, wait—when you have two adjacent Br atoms, perhaps the elimination forms a carbonyl. No, wait, elimination typically forms alkenes, not carbonyls. Unless it's a case where the base abstracts a proton, and then the Br leaves, but in this case, with two Brs, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation twice, forming a carbonyl. Wait no, elimination would give an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps it's an example of a pinacol-like rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone. Because the IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl, probably a ketone. So product 1 must be a ketone. How does that happen? Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Oh wait, maybe it's a case of the formation of a geminal diol, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination followed by a ring contraction or expansion. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the two Brs are on the same carbon—making it a geminal dihalide. Wait, the question says 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which would have Brs on different carbons, not the same. So geminal dihalide is not the case here.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again: when vicinal dihalides react with strong bases, they form alkenes via dehydrohalogenation. So product 1 would be an alkene. But the IR shows a carbonyl, which doesn't fit. So maybe the reaction is something else. Wait, perhaps I'm forgetting another reaction. Oh, wait! Maybe it's a case of the formation of a carbonyl via elimination. Wait, how? If the dihalide is such that elimination leads to a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps instead of elimination, it's a substitution. But KOH is more likely to cause elimination than substitution in this case.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction produces a ketone via a Friedel-Crafts type reaction, but that doesn't seem applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps KOH is causing the formation of a peroxide or something else. Hmm.

Wait, I'm stuck here. Let me look at the NMR data for product 1. The 1H NMR shows:

4.79 ppm (2H) — that's a singlet, perhaps from an oxygen-bearing group. Maybe an -OH group or an ether? Or possibly a CH2 group next to an oxygen.

Wait, but KOH is a strong base, so maybe the product is a diol. Wait, if it's a diol, the peaks would be in the range of 1-5 ppm. But the IR peak at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, which is more consistent with a ketone or an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diketone. Because if the reaction forms a ketone, that would explain the IR. But how?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by a ring-opening. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is converted into a ketone via a mechanism where each HBr is eliminated, and the two carbons lose both Brs and form a carbonyl group. But how? That would require two eliminations, each forming a carbonyl, but that seems unlikely. Or perhaps it's a case where two adjacent Br atoms are replaced by a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that elimination leads to the formation of a bridgehead double bond, but that might not form a ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is not an alkene but a ketone. Let me think about this again. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with a base, perhaps a metathesis occurs, or perhaps a neighboring group participation. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to the elimination of a Br and the formation of a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of the formation of a carbonyl via the elimination of two equivalents of HBr. So each Br is on a carbon adjacent to another, and eliminating both HBr would form a double bond and perhaps something else. Wait, no, that would lead to an alkene.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the product's IR: 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which is around the range for a ketone (around 1700-1750 cm-1). So product 1 is likely a ketone. So how does 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone when treated with KOH?

Wait a second! Oh, I think I remember something about the formation of a ketone from a dihalide. If the dihalide is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of HBr, and then another elimination, but wait, how does that form a ketone?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, forming a bridgehead carbonyl. Wait, maybe the two bromides are on adjacent carbons, and upon elimination, each forms a double bond. But that wouldn't make a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm looking at this wrong. Let's think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has a structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together, giving a diamond-like structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on adjacent bridgehead carbons.

When KOH is added, perhaps the base induces the loss of HBr from each Br, leading to the formation of a double bond. But in the case of bridgehead positions, the double bond may not be possible due to Bredt's rule, which states that bridgehead double bonds are not stable in small bicyclic systems. So in that case, elimination may not be feasible, leading the reaction to proceed via a different pathway.

Wait, but if elimination is not possible, perhaps the reaction forms a carbonyl instead. Let me think: If two adjacent Br atoms are present, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to each Br, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. Wait, but how? Each Br is on a different carbon. Let me imagine the structure:

Imagine two adjacent carbons, each with a Br. The base could abstract a hydrogen from each, leading to the formation of a double bond. But if that's not possible due to Bredt's rule, maybe the molecule undergoes a ring contraction or expansion, leading to the formation of a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and when each Br is removed as HBr, the adjacent carbons form a carbonyl group. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a diketone. But the NMR of product 1 shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), which could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen, perhaps an ether or a ketone. Let me think: if product 1 is a diketone, the NMR would have carbonyl groups, but the 4.79 ppm would be for some CH2 near an oxygen. Alternatively, maybe it's a gem-diol, but that's less likely.

Wait, another approach: the NMR of product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a singlet. That could be a methylene group (CH2) attached to an oxygen, like an ether or a carbonyl. For example, in an acetal structure, the CH2 would be around 3-4 ppm, but maybe with some deshielding, it could be 4.79.

Wait, but product 1's IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone. Let me think: if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, and elimination occurs, but instead of forming a double bond, perhaps the elimination leads to a carbonyl group. How would that happen?

Wait, maybe the KOH is acting as a base, abstracting a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbonyl via elimination. Oh wait, I think that happens in the pinacol rearrangement, but that's for vicinal diols. Alternatively, maybe it's a similar process here, but with dihalides.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me move on and see if that helps. So product 1 is a ketone, then in the next step, it's heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2.

Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is formed via a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, product 1's structure is a ketone, so maybe it's being used as an acylating agent.

Alternatively, product 1 could be an alkene, and the aluminum isopropoxide is used for some kind of addition or polymerization. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but let's think again: product 1's NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H), which could be an OCH2 group. And the IR suggests a carbonyl, perhaps an ester or a ketone. So product 1 could be a diketone or something with a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction produces a diol, but that doesn't fit with the IR. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a epoxide. Because when vicinal dihalides react with a base, they can form epoxides. Oh wait, yes! When a vicinal dihalide is treated with a strong base like KOH, it can form an epoxide via an elimination-addition mechanism. Let me think about that.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane (vicinal dihalide) + KOH → epoxide. The epoxide would have an oxygen connecting the two adjacent carbons that previously had Brs. The NMR of the epoxide would show the two CH2 groups adjacent to the oxygen as a singlet. Wait, but in an epoxide, the two CH2 groups would be split into a quartet or a triplet because of the neighboring groups. Hmm, but the NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a singlet. So maybe that's not an epoxide.

Alternatively, the epoxide would have two sets of peaks for the adjacent CH2 groups. Wait, maybe I'm not thinking clearly. Let me think about the structure of an epoxide derived from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The two adjacent carbons would each have two Hs, and each would be next to the oxygen. The Hs on each CH2 would be split by the neighboring CH2. So in the NMR, each set of Hs would be a quartet, perhaps, due to coupling with two Hs on the adjacent carbon. But the product 1 NMR shows 4.79 as a singlet, which doesn't fit with this.

So perhaps product 1 isn't an epoxide. Maybe it's a diketone. Let me think: If product 1 is a diketone, the NMR would show peaks for the carbonyl Hs, but in a ketone, the carbonyl is a C=O, and in the H NMR, the Hs adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded and appear as a triplet or something else. Alternatively, if the Hs are on a CH2 next to the carbonyl, they would be around 2-3 ppm. But product 1's NMR shows 4.79 as a singlet, which is more upfield than that.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol. But the IR shows a carbonyl, so that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction conditions. KOH is used in excess and heating. So perhaps it's a double elimination, forming an alkene, but that doesn't fit the IR. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is converted into a ketone via a different mechanism. Wait, another possibility is that the two Br atoms are on the same carbon, but the question says 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which would have them on adjacent carbons, not the same.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, but that's less likely with a vicinal dihalide and KOH. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this, and product 1 is an alkene with a conjugated carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Let me think again. The IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong indication of a carbonyl group. So product 1 must have a carbonyl. So perhaps the reaction is converting the vicinal dihalide into a ketone via an elimination followed by some rearrangement.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the dihalide undergoes a double elimination, but instead of forming a double bond, it loses two HBr molecules and forms a carbonyl group. How? Maybe each Br is on a carbon next to another Br, and elimination leads to the formation of a carbonyl between them.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of the formation of a ketone via a process similar to the Corey-Fuchs reaction or other elimination to form carbonyls. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of the formation of a ketone via the removal of two HBr molecules, but that doesn't quite make sense to me.

Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH, leading to the substitution of each Br with an -OH group. But that would make a diol, which doesn't fit the IR.

Hmm, this is taking too long, and I'm not making progress. Let me try to move forward and see if I can figure out the rest even if I don't get product 1.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's 1,3-adamantanedione or something similar. Then, product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, which is a strong Lewis acid. So what reaction occurs here? Maybe a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But for that, the ketone would need to act as an acylating agent. Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is undergoing some kind of cyclization or rearrangement.

Alternatively, if product 1 is an alkene with a carbonyl group, perhaps the aluminum isopropoxide is causing some addition or polymerization. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: if product 1 is a ketone, when heated with aluminum isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes a Diels-Alder reaction or some other cycloaddition. But without a diene, that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the aluminum isopropoxide is acting as a catalyst for a ring-opening or another reaction. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an ester. Let's think: if the dihalide is converted into an ester. But I don't see how KOH would do that. Alternatively, maybe the product is a carbonyl chloride, but that would require different conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is a dienophile or something else.

Moving on to product 2, which is then subjected to ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide, leading to product 3.

Ozone at low temperature (like -78°C) typically leads to ozonolysis of alkenes, breaking the double bond and forming ozonides, which upon workup (like with dimethylsulfide) give aldehydes or ketones, depending on the substituents around the double bond.

So if product 2 has a double bond, product 3 would be the ozonolysis products, which are carbonyl compounds.

But the question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding those that exchange with the solvent). So perhaps product 3 has some protons near a carbonyl group, which are deshielded.

Now, going back to product 2. Let me think: if product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is formed by heating with aluminum isopropoxide, perhaps product 2 is a dienophile or a compound with a conjugated diene, which upon ozonolysis would break into fragments with carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, product 2 could be a di-substituted alkene. Let me think: if product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 has a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl, then ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think of the overall process.

The first reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with a carbonyl). 

Second reaction: product 1 → product 2, which upon ozonolysis gives product 3.

So product 3 would be the ozonolysis products, which are likely aldehydes or ketones. The NMR of product 3 is the last step.

But let me try to figure out each step.

First reaction: product 1's NMR has 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H).

The 4.79 ppm is a singlet, perhaps an OCH2 group. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be from CH2 groups around the ring, and 1.94 (2H) perhaps from another CH2.

Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps the structure is such that there's a CH2 next to the carbonyl, which would be around 2.1-2.4 ppm. But 4.79 is higher, so maybe it's from another group.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a geminal diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester. For example, an ester would have a carbonyl and an OCH2 group. The OCH2 group would appear around 4 ppm as a quartet or something similar, but in the product 1 NMR, it's a singlet, 4.79 (2H). So maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, such as in an ether or an ester.

Wait, but without more information, perhaps I should focus on the ozonolysis part.

If product 2 has a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it into fragments. Let's say product 2 is a di-substituted alkene. Ozonolysis would give two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is CH2=CH-R, ozonolysis would produce RCHO and another aldehyde or ketone.

But in the context of adamantane, which is a highly branched structure, perhaps the product after ozonolysis would have smaller fragments.

Assuming product 3 is a carbonyl-containing compound, the most deshielded hydrogen would be near the carbonyl group. The coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring protons.

For example, if a hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl group and coupled to two other equivalent protons, it might be a triplet. Or if coupled to two sets of protons, it could be a more complex pattern.

Wait, let's think about a specific example. Suppose product 3 is a ketone with a CH2 group next to the carbonyl. The CH2 would be split by any neighboring protons. If there are two neighboring protons, each on adjacent carbons, it could lead to a triplet or doublet of triplets, etc.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the possible structure.

If product 3 is a ketone, say, (CH2)nCO, and the CH2 group is adjacent to the carbonyl, the protons on the CH2 would be split by any neighboring groups.

Wait, but the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen. Deshielding occurs near electron-withdrawing groups like carbonyls. So the protons nearest to the carbonyl would be the most deshielded.

If those protons are on a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl and are coupled to another set of protons, the coupling pattern would depend on that.

For example, if a CH2 group is next to a carbonyl and has two neighboring protons (like in a CH2-CH2-CO), the protons on the CH2 would be split by the neighboring CH2. Each proton on the first CH2 would be split by two protons on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if there are two adjacent CH groups, the coupling might be more complex.

But in the case of ozonolysis, the product would be two carbonyl compounds. Suppose product 2 is an alkene, say, CH2=CH-... , then ozonolysis would break it into two aldehyde groups. Let's say the structure is such that each fragment has a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl.

So the most deshielded H would be on the CH2 next to the carbonyl. Each of these Hs would be split by the neighboring group.

Wait, but in ozonolysis, the breaking of the double bond forms two carbonyl groups. So if product 2 is an internal di-substituted alkene, the ozonolysis would give two ketone groups. For example, if product 2 is R-CH2-CH2-R', ozonolysis would yield two molecules of R-CO and R'-CO.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of a simple example. Suppose product 2 is 1,2-diphenylethylene. Ozonolysis would break it into two benzaldehyde molecules. But in this case, since the molecule is based on adamantane, perhaps the ozonolysis produces smaller fragments with carbonyl groups.

Assuming that, the most deshielded H would be on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say the structure is CH2(CO)..., then each H on the CH2 would be next to the carbonyl. The neighboring Hs would determine the splitting.

If the CH2 group is adjacent to another CH2 group, then each H on the CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. That would result in a triplet for each H.

So in the NMR, the most deshielded H would be a triplet.

Looking at the options, option A is triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 group is adjacent to a CH group, the coupling would be more complex. For example, if there's a CH group next to the CH2, each H on the CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH, leading to a triplet. But if there are two different adjacent groups, maybe more splitting occurs.

Wait, but the question says to ignore exchangeable protons, so we're focusing on the most deshielded non-exchangeable H. So in this case, the Hs next to the carbonyl would be the most deshielded.

So, considering all this, the coupling pattern would likely be a triplet, so the answer is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **First Reaction (1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH):**  
   - The reaction likely involves elimination of two equivalents of HBr, forming a carbonyl compound. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).  
   - The ¹H NMR spectrum of product 1 includes a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), which could correspond to a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen atom. The other peaks (2.41-2.23 ppm and 1.94 ppm) suggest additional hydrogens in the structure, likely from the adamantane framework.  
   - Based on the IR and NMR data, product 1 is likely a ketone or a related carbonyl-containing compound.

2. **Second Reaction (product 1 + aluminum isopropoxide):**  
   - Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, commonly used as a catalyst in reactions like Friedel-Crafts acylation. This step likely modifies the carbonyl compound (product 1) to form product 2, which contains a double bond. The exact structure of product 2 is not explicitly determined but is inferred to have a reactive site (e.g., an alkene) that can undergo ozonolysis in the next step.

3. **Third Reaction (product 2 + ozone followed by dimethylsulfide):**  
   - Ozonolysis of product 2 cleaves the double bond, forming product 3. The reaction conditions (-78°C and dimethylsulfide) suggest that the ozonide intermediate is worked up to yield aldehydes or ketones.  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would likely be near a carbonyl group, as carbonyls strongly deshield adjacent hydrogens. The coupling pattern of this hydrogen depends on the number of neighboring hydrogens.  

4. **Analysis of the Coupling Pattern:**  
   - If the most deshielded hydrogen is on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, it would be split by the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet.  
   - This matches the expected splitting pattern for such a configuration.

Based on the reasoning above, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

**Answer: A**
