Okay, so I have this physics problem about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question describes a spherical conductor with radius R. Inside this conductor, there's a small spherical cavity with radius r, and the center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So the cavity isn't at the center of the conductor; it's shifted by s. The problem states that r is less than R, which makes sense because the cavity is inside the conductor.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question asks about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, so we're definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, I remember that for conductors, charges reside on the surface. But wait, this is a conductor with a cavity. Oh right, when there's a charge inside the cavity, it induces charges on the inner surface of the conductor. Specifically, the inner surface will have an induced charge of -q, because the conductor is initially uncharged. Then, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance it out. Wait, no. Let me think. The conductor is neutral. When a charge +q is inside the cavity, it induces a -q on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the total charge of the conductor is zero, the outer surface must have a charge of +q.

Wait, but wait. The conductor is uncharged, so initially, it has zero charge. When I put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q, leaving the outer surface with +q. Because the conductor's overall charge is zero, the sum of inner and outer charges must be zero. So inner is -q, outer is +q.

But then, when considering the electric field outside the conductor, does the distribution of the outer charges matter? Because for a spherical conductor, the outer charges would arrange themselves spherically symmetrically, right? Because any external influences (like the inner charge) are inside, and the outer field should only depend on the total outer charge.

Wait, but in this case, the cavity is not at the center. The center of the cavity is offset by a distance s from the center of the conductor. So the inner surface isn't symmetrical around the conductor's center. But wait, wait. No, that might not matter. Because when the inner charge is placed inside the cavity, the induced charges on the inner surface of the conductor will arrange themselves in a way to cancel the electric field within the conductor material. So the inner surface's charge distribution will be such that inside the conductor (the material), the field is zero.

But the cavity is not at the center, so the inner surface's induced charge isn't symmetrical. Wait, but since the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface's charge distribution is symmetrical. Because any external point outside the conductor will 'see' the outer charge as if it's a point charge at the center. That's because of the shell theorem. So for points outside the conductor, the electric field due to the charges on the outer surface would be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center.

So when considering the electric field at point P outside the conductor, the field is due to the outer charge, which is +q. But wait, the outer charge is +q, so the field outside would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L², but that's only if the charge distribution is spherically symmetric. But wait, the outer charges are on a conducting shell, which is a sphere, so yes, it's symmetric.

Wait, but in this case, what about the inner charge? The point P is outside the conductor, so the inner charge is inside a conductor. The conductor's outer surface has +q, so the field outside is as if it's a point charge at the center. But wait, the charge in the cavity is +q, so the inner surface has -q and the outer +q. So the net charge on the conductor is zero? No, wait. Wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So when +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface must have -q. Then, the total conductor's charge is zero, so the outer surface must have +q. So the conductor's outer surface has +q, and the inner has -q.

So when we're outside the conductor, the field is due to the +q on the outer surface. So the field at P would be the same as if a point charge +q were placed at the center of the conductor. So the distance from P to the center is L, so the field should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Looking at the options, option B is this.

But wait, I need to make sure whether the position of the cavity affects the field outside. Because the cavity is off-center, does that influence the outer field? I don't think so. Because the outer surface is a conductor's shell, the induced charges on it will distribute to cancel any internal fields, but since the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface is symmetric. So regardless of where the inner charge is placed (even if it's off-center inside the cavity), the outer induced charge will arrange itself uniformly, making the field outside as if all the charge is at the center.

Wait, but if the cavity is off-center, does that make the inner surface's charge distribution asymmetric? Yes, the inner surface's charge would be more on the side closer to the cavity. But the outer surface, being a conductor, must have a symmetric charge distribution because any excess charge on a conductor resides on the outer surface, and for a sphere, any excess charge distributes uniformly. Wait, no. Wait, no, that's only if there are no other external fields. But in this case, the conductor is in electrostatic equilibrium, so the charges on the outer surface will arrange themselves to cancel any electric fields within the conductor material.

If the charge in the cavity is displaced, the inner surface's charge distribution will be non-uniform, but the outer surface's charge will still distribute uniformly because the conductor is a sphere. Because the external point P is outside the conductor, the field due to the outer charge is symmetric, so it depends only on the total charge of the outer surface, which is +q.

Wait, but why? Let me think again. Imagine the conductor as two concentric shells: the inner shell (radius R) with charge -q, and the outer shell (radius R) with charge +q. Any point outside would only feel the +q as if it's a point at the center, regardless of where the inner charge is placed.

Wait, but in this problem, the cavity isn't at the center. So the inner surface's charge is not symmetric. But no, the inner surface's charge must arrange to shield the conductor's interior. So the conductor's material (the region between R and the cavity) is a conductor, so the electric field there is zero. The charge on the inner surface (cavity's inner wall) must be such that the field inside the conductor is zero. So if the cavity is off-center, the inner surface's charge distribution is non-symmetric, but the outer surface's charge remains symmetric.

Therefore, the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed, and for any point outside the conductor, the field due to the outer charges is as if all the charge were at the center. So the electric field at P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L². That would be option B.

Wait, but the options have other possibilities. Option A has (l - s cosθ) squared. Option C has (l + s cosθ) squared. Option D is just 1/l² times q.

Wait, but in the problem, point P's distance from the cavity's center is l, and the distance between the two centers is s. So the centers are separated by s. The point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, which is also the distance from the conductor's center to the point P, and the angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me visualize the setup. The conductor has radius R, and a cavity of radius r is inside, but its center is a distance s away from the conductor's center. So the cavity is a sphere of radius r centered at a point which is s units away from the conductor's center. The conductor's material is between the cavity and its own surface.

When the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) has an induced charge of -q. The outer surface has +q. Now, the outer surface is a sphere of radius R, so the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, and is as if the charge were at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but no. Because the charge is on the outer surface, which is a sphere. So regardless of the internal arrangement, the external field is as if the charge is at the center.

So for point P outside, located at a distance L from the conductor's center, the field is E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q) / L².

But wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Because the charge inside the cavity is at a different position, the induced charges on the inner surface may cause the outer surface's charges to distribute in a certain way. But no, the outer surface must distribute symmetrically because it's a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium. Because the conductor is a sphere, any excess charge on its outer surface must distribute uniformly, making the field outside as if the charge were a point charge at the center.

Wait a minute, but what if the cavity is not at the center of the conductor? Does that affect the symmetry of the outer surface's charges? Because the inner charge is inside the cavity, which is off-center. So the inner surface's charges are non-uniform, but the outer surface is a sphere and the charges there are uniform.

Wait, no. Because the outer surface is a conductor's shell. Any external charge on a conducting shell would arrange to make the field inside zero. So for the outer surface, the field it creates inside the conductor (the region between inner and outer surfaces) is zero. Therefore, the outer surface's charge distribution must be uniform, regardless of where the inner charge is placed.

Wait, but maybe I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think again. The inner surface has a non-uniform charge distribution because the cavity's charge is off-center, but the outer surface's charge is uniform because it's a conductor in a symmetrical configuration.

So, when considering the field outside the conductor, it's as if the charge is at the center, so the distance from P to the center is L. So the field is E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

So looking at the options, option B matches that.

But wait, one of the options is E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / l². So option D. Why might that be?

Ah, wait. Because point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center. If the outer surface's charge were not uniform, perhaps the field depends on l. But no, because the conductor's outer surface is a sphere, the field outside is determined by the total charge and the distance from the center.

So the conductor's outer charge is +q, located at radius R. So the distance from P to the outer center is L, so E is q/(4πε₀ L²).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about Gauss's Law. For a Gaussian surface outside the conductor (radius L), the enclosed charge is +q. So E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q) / L². That's it. So answer option B is correct.

But looking at the options again, option B is exactly that. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but what if the presence of the cavity's off-center affects the field? Because the cavity's position might cause the outer charges to be arranged in a way that affects the field. But no, the outer charges are on a spherical shell, so their distribution is uniform, and the field outside is as if the charge is at the center. So the position of the inner cavity's charge doesn't affect the outer field.

So the correct answer is option B.

The problem involves a spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ inside it. The center of the cavity is offset by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Induced Charges**: Since the conductor is initially uncharged, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will have an induced charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material. The outer surface of the conductor will then have a charge of $+q$ to ensure the conductor remains neutral.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For points outside the conductor, the electric field depends only on the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor. The outer surface is a spherical shell, so the charges distribute uniformly due to the symmetry of the sphere. By Gauss's Law, the electric field outside the conductor is equivalent to that produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor.

3. **Distance and Field Calculation**: The distance from the point $P$ to the center of the conductor is $L$. Using Coulomb's Law, the magnitude of the electric field at $P$ is:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Irrelevance of Cavity Position**: The position of the cavity (offset by $s$) and the angle $\theta$ do not affect the electric field outside the conductor. The outer surface's uniform charge distribution ensures that the field at $P$ depends only on the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant for the electric field outside the conductor.
- **Option B**: Correct. Matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The expression involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant for the electric field outside the conductor.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The electric field does not depend on $l$, the distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity.

### Final Answer:
The electric field at point $P$ is given by:
\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]
