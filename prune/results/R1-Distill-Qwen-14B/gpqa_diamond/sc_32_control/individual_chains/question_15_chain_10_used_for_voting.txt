Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of them transiting their host stars. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me start by recalling what a transit is. A transit occurs when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the size of the orbit.

Wait, the question says both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So if the period is shorter, that means Planet_1 is closer to its star because orbital period relates to distance via Kepler's third law. 

The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. That's interesting. So, even though Planet_1's star is more massive, it's the same size. I remember that the radius of a star can affect the transit probability.

The transit probability (Rp) is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2, where R_p is the planet's radius and R_s is the star's radius. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the probability is more complex. I think it's the ratio of the area of the planet to the area of the star. So the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2. But wait, that's not considering the orbital distance. Oh right, the probability also depends on the impact parameter, which relates to the alignment of the orbit. But in the case where the orbit is edge-on, which is the best case for a transit, the probability is maximized. 

Wait, but how do the orbital periods and star masses affect the probability? Let me think. The probability of transit is higher for planets with smaller orbital distances because the chance that the line of sight intersects the planet's orbit is higher. So if a planet is closer in, it's more likely to transit. 

Wait, the formula for the probability of transit is actually (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis. But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a. So the probability is proportional to (R_s / a). 

But wait, the actual formula is a bit different. The geometric probability, which is the probability that a randomly oriented orbit causes a transit, is (R_s / a) * (1 + (R_p / R_s)), but since R_p << R_s, it's approximately R_s / (a * (1 - e^2)^0.5). But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so it's R_s / a. 

So P ~ (R_s / a). 

But wait, another way I remember it is that the probability is (R_s / a) multiplied by the fraction of the orbit where the planet can transit, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the standard formula for the transit probability is:

P = (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (1 - (b²))) where b is the impact parameter. But that's part of the transit duration and depth, not the probability of the transit happening. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up. 

Wait, the geometric probability, which is the probability that a randomly oriented orbit will transit, is (R_s + R_p) / a, but since R_p is tiny compared to R_s, it's approximately R_s / a. So the probability is proportional to R_s / a.

So higher probability when R_s is larger or a is smaller. 

In this case, both stars have the same radius R_s. So the probability depends inversely on a. So the planet with the smaller semi-major axis (a) has a higher probability of transiting.

So which planet has a smaller a? Since the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's, using Kepler's third law, a^3 is proportional to (P^2)(M_star). Because Kepler's law is a^3 = (G(M_star + m_planet) P^2) / (4π²). Since M_star >> m_planet, it's roughly a^3 ≈ (G M_star P^2)/(4π²). 

So a is proportional to (P^2 M_star)^(1/3).

So for Planet_1: a1 proportional to (P1^2 M1)^(1/3). 

For Planet_2: a2 proportional to (P2^2 M2)^(1/3).

Given that P1 = (1/3) P2, and M1 = 2 M2.

So a1/a2 = [ ( ( (P1^2) M1 ) / (P2^2 M2) ) ]^(1/3 )

Substituting:

P1 = (1/3) P2 → P1^2 = (1/9) P2^2 

M1 = 2 M2 

So numerator: (1/9 P2^2) * 2 M2 → (2/9) P2^2 M2 

Denominator: P2^2 M2 

So the ratio is (2/9) / 1 = 2/9. 

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3). Let's compute that. 2/9 is approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6. Because 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2. 

Since R_s is the same for both stars, and the probability is proportional to R_s / a, Planet_1 has a higher P because its a is smaller. 

So P1/P2 = (R_s/(a1)) / (R_s/(a2)) ) = a2 / a1. 

We found a1 ≈ 0.6 a2 → a2 = a1 / 0.6 → a2= (1/0.6) a1 → approximately 1.6667 a1. 

So P1/P2 = a2/a1 ≈ 1.6667 → approximately 1.666... times. 

So Planet_1 has about 1.66 times the probability of Planet_2.

Wait, but wait, the options are about which planet is preferred. So the probability is higher for Planet_1, so they should observe Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Options:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~2.25 higher.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to 1.5 times.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times.

Wait, I calculated 1.66, which is approximately 1.65 as in option C. So the researchers will choose Planet_1, as it has about 1.65 times higher probability.

Wait, but in my calculation, P1 is 1.66 times higher than P2. So the probability of transiting is higher for Planet_1. So the correct option would be C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_s}{a} \), where \( R_s \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_s \)), the probability depends inversely on the semi-major axis (\( a \)).

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto P^2 M_s \), where \( P \) is the orbital period and \( M_s \) is the mass of the host star, we calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes for Planet_1 and Planet_2. Given that \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3} P_2 \) and \( M_1 = 2 M_2 \), the ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{P_1^2 M_1}{P_2^2 M_2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{\left(\frac{1}{3} P_2\right)^2 \cdot 2 M_2}{P_2^2 M_2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3}.
\]

Approximating \( \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6 \), we find \( a_1 \approx 0.6 a_2 \). This means Planet_1 has a smaller semi-major axis and, therefore, a higher transit probability.

The transit probability ratio is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67.
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Since the researchers aim to observe the planet with the higher transit probability, they will prefer Planet_1.
