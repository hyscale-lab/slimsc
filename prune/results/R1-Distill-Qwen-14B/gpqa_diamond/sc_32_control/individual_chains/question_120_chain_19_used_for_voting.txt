Okay, let's try to figure out this astronomy question. Hmm, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. So, parallax is a measure of distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Wait, no, actually, wait. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Oh, uniform distribution—so same density everywhere. But how does that affect the number of stars per unit parallax?

I remember that the number of stars you observe in a certain volume depends on the distance. Parallax is p = 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs, I think. So if a star is at distance d, its parallax is p = 1/d.

Now, when you consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd, the volume of that shell would be the surface area times the thickness. The surface area of a sphere is 4πd². So volume is 4πd² dd.

But wait, the number of stars in that volume depends on the density. Since the density is uniform, the number of stars N in the shell is density * volume. Let me think, density is stars per unit volume. So N = density * 4πd² dd.

But the question is about number per unit parallax. Parallax p is 1/d, so d = 1/p. Let's express everything in terms of p. So d = 1/p → dd = -1/p² dp. But since p decreases as d increases, maybe I should be careful with the limits, but maybe for small intervals, the negative sign just indicates direction, but since we're dealing with magnitude, perhaps I can ignore it for now.

So substituting d into the expression for N: N = density * 4π (1/p²)² * (-1/p² dp) → Wait, wait, let's see. Wait, d is 1/p, so d squared is (1/p)^2. So the volume is 4π d² dd = 4π (1/p²) * ( -1/p² dp ). So putting it together:

N = density * 4π (1/p²) * ( -1/p² ) dp )

Wait, but that seems a bit off. Let me re-express the volume in terms of p.

d = 1/p → dd = -1/p² dp. So the volume is 4π d² dd = 4π (1/p²) (-1/p²) dp.

So the volume element for a thin shell in terms of p is 4π (1/p²) * (-1/p²) dp. But wait, the negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases, but for the number of stars, we can take the positive value since we're considering the magnitude.

So the number of stars in a thin shell with parallax between p and p+dp is N = density * 4π (1/p²) (1/p²) dp. Wait, no, wait. Let's think again: the volume of the shell is 4π d² dd. But since d = 1/p, dd = - (1/p²) dp. So the volume is 4π (1/p)^2 * ( -1/p^2 dp ) = -4π (1/p^4) dp. The negative sign indicates that as p increases (moving to more distant stars), the volume decreases. But since we're counting stars, we can consider the absolute value, so the volume element is (4π/p⁴) dp.

So the number of stars in a shell at parallax p is N = density * (4π / p⁴) dp.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So per unit dp, it's density * 4π / p^4.

So as p increases (stars are farther away), the number of stars per unit parallax range decreases as 1/p^4.

Wait, but the options are in terms of how the number changes with plx. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number decreases with p^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, sometimes when dealing with flux or distances, the expression can involve other terms. But in this scenario, the density is uniform, so the logic should hold.

Another way to think: the number of stars in a range of parallaxes from p to p + dp is proportional to the surface area at distance d=1/p, multiplied by the thickness in parallax. But wait, the thickness in distance is related to the parallax. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, from the perspective of parallax. The number of stars with parallax between p and p + dp is N = (number per unit volume) * (volume between p and p+dp).

Volume between p and p+dp is the volume of the shell at distance d=1/p with thickness dd. So again, V = 4π d² dd. And since d=1/p, dd = -1/p² dp. So V = 4π (1/p²) * ( -1/p² dp ) → |V| = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So number of stars, N = n * |V| = n * (4π / p^4) dp. So the number per unit p (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the correct option is A: ~1/plx^4.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( p = \frac{1}{d} \). The question assumes stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, meaning the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume itself.

Consider a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \). The volume of this shell is given by:

\[
V = 4\pi d^2 dd
\]

Since \( d = \frac{1}{p} \), we can express \( dd \) as:

\[
dd = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp
\]

Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{p} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \) into the volume expression:

\[
V = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) \left(-\frac{1}{p^2} dp\right) = -\frac{4\pi}{p^4} dp
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction of change, but for the purpose of counting stars, we take the magnitude:

\[
V = \frac{4\pi}{p^4} dp
\]

The number of stars \( N \) in this shell is proportional to the volume and the stellar density \( n \):

\[
N = n \cdot V = n \cdot \frac{4\pi}{p^4} dp
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax \( dp \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{p^4} \). Therefore, as parallax \( p \) increases, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \sim \frac{1}{p^4} \).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**
