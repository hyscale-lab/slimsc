Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again.

So, the problem is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, wait. I remember that stability constants (formation constants) are for the formation of complexes. So, for each complex, βn is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the nth complex. 

The complexes would be Co(SCN)_n^2-n. So, β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^-2, β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, but wait. The problem mentions 'dithiocyanato' complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands attached. So that's the Co(SCN)_2 complex, right? Which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So, we're looking for the percentage of this species compared to all the Co species present.

So, the first thing I think is that we need to calculate the fraction of each possible complex, considering all the possible species, and then find the fraction of the β2 complex (the dithiocyanato one) in that mixture.

But how do we approach this? I remember that when dealing with such equilibria, the formation of complexes depends on the concentration of the ligand and the stability constants.

The problem involves multiple complexes, so I think the approach is to use the formation constants to calculate the distribution of each species.

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the possible cobalt species. Let me list the possible complexes:

- Co^2+ (n=0)
- [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1)
- [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2)
- [Co(SCN)_3]^-2 (n=3)
- [Co(SCN)_4]^2- (n=4)

So, the formation steps would be:

1. Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)]^+ ; β1 = 9
2. [Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^0 ; β2 =40
3. [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_3]^-2 ; β3=63
4. [Co(SCN)_3]^-2 + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_4]^2- ; β4=16

Wait, but I think the way the β's work is that each β is the equilibrium constant for the stepwise addition. So, the overall β for each complex would be the product of the previous βs. Or maybe not. Alternatively, the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) is the product of β1 through βn.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: the stepwise constants are β1, β2, etc. The overall formation constant K for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) would be the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, no. Because each β is for adding one more ligand. So, the overall K for the first complex is β1. The K for the second is β1 * β2. For the third, K = β1 * β2 * β3, and so on.

Wait, but the problem gives the β values as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So, each β is the equilibrium constant for adding the nth ligand. So, the overall K for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) is the product of β1 to βn.

So, for n=2, the overall K is β1 * β2 = 9 * 40 = 360.

Wait, but wait. Wait, that's correct for the stepwise formation. So, the first complex is CoSCN+ with K=9, the second is [CoSCN2]^0, K=9*40=360, etc.

But wait, I think when you have a series of formation steps, the overall K for the nth complex is the product of the stepwise βs up to n.

So, perhaps, for each n, the formation constant is K_n = β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

So, for n=1, K_1 = 9.

n=2: K_2=9*40=360.

n=3: K_3=9*40*63=9*40=360, 360*63=22680.

n=4: K_4=22680 *16=362880.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach is that each β is a stepwise constant, so for Co^2+ + n SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n), the overall K is the product of the β's up to n. So that's correct.

But another approach is that the fraction of each species can be calculated using the cumulative product of β's, but considering the ligand concentrations and the total metal concentration.

But this problem has multiple complexes, so we need to model the distribution of each possible species under the given conditions.

But dealing with four complexes might be complicated. Maybe an approximation can be made. Alternatively, perhaps in this case, the dominant species is the one with the highest K. Wait, but the beta values have β3 highest, followed by β1, β2, and β4 is lower than β3.

But wait, the overall K for each species is important. Let me compute the overall K for each possible n.

n=0: [Co^2+], no ligand attached. Its K is 1 (since it's the free ion).

n=1: K1=9.

n=2: K2=9*40=360.

n=3: K3=9*40*63=22680.

n=4: K4=22680 *16=362880.

So, the K values are highest for n=4, then n=3, then n=2, then n=1.

Wait, but wait. K4 is 362,880, which is much larger than K3. So, perhaps the dominant species is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But wait, the ligand concentration is 0.1 M. Are the concentrations high enough for the higher complexes to form? Because higher K means more stable, but if the ligand is not very concentrated, maybe the higher complexes don't form much.

Alternatively, perhaps the formation of each complex is determined by a ratio involving the ligand concentration and the β's.

I think the approach is to model the fraction of each species using the distribution equations.

The fraction f_n of each species [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) is given by f_n = (K_n * [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + sum over m=0 to 4 of K_m [SCN^-]^m )

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The general expression for the fraction of the nth species in a system where a metal can form complexes with ligand L is:

f_n = (K_n [L]^n) / (sum over m=0 to M of K_m [L]^m )

Where M is the maximum possible number of ligands.

In this case, M=4, since β4 is given.

So, for each n from 0 to 4, the K_n is the overall formation constant for that complex, which is the product of β1 to βn.

So, let's compute K_n for each n.

n=0: K0 =1 (no ligands).

n=1: K1=9.

n=2: K2=9*40=360.

n=3: K3=9*40*63=22680.

n=4: K4=22680 *16=362880.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, K0 is 1, and K1 is β1, K2 is β1*β2, etc. Correct.

So, [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

So, each term in the denominator is K_n * [SCN^-]^n.

So, let's compute each term:

Term for n=0: K0 * [L]^0 =1 *1=1.

n=1: 9 * (0.1)^1 =9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2:360 * (0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

n=3:22680 * (0.1)^3=22680 * 0.001=22.68.

n=4:362880 * (0.1)^4=362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

So, each term is:

n=0:1

n=1:0.9

n=2:3.6

n=3:22.68

n=4:36.288

Now, sum all these terms to get the denominator.

Sum=1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Let me calculate that step by step.

1 +0.9=1.9.

1.9 +3.6=5.5.

5.5 +22.68=28.18.

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So, denominator is 64.468.

Now, the fraction of each species is (K_n [L]^n) / sum.

We're interested in the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So, f_2 is (3.6) / 64.468.

Compute that: 3.6 /64.468 ≈ ?

Let me calculate 3.6 ÷ 64.468.

Well, 64.468 × 0.05 = 3.2234, which is close to 3.6.

Wait, 64.468 * 0.055 is 64.468 *0.05=3.2234, plus 64.468 *0.005=0.32234, so total 3.54574. Close to 3.6.

So, 0.055 gives 3.54574. So 0.055 gives ~3.54574, which is just a bit less than 3.6.

So, 3.6 -3.54574=0.05426.

0.05426 /64.468 = approx 0.000841.

So, 0.055 + 0.000841 ≈ 0.05584, which is about 5.584%.

Wait, but that's only for n=2. Hmm, but wait, I thought [Co(SCN)_2] is the dithiocyanato complex. So, the fraction is about 5.584%?

But wait, looking at the options, the choices are in the 16-42% range. So, that can't be right. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I messed up the K_n calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, the K_n is the product of β1 to βn.

So, for n=0, K0=1.

n=1: K1=9.

n=2: K2=9*40=360.

n=3:360 *63= 22680.

n=4:22680*16=362880.

Wait, correct.

Then, each term for the sum is K_n * [L]^n.

[L] is 0.1.

So, for n=0: 1.

n=1:9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2:360 *0.01=3.6.

n=3:22680 * 0.001=22.68.

n=4:362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Adding them up: 1 + 0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So, the denominator is 64.468.

So, for each species:

n=0: 1/64.468 ≈0.01551 → 1.551%.

n=1:0.9/64.468≈0.01397 →1.397%.

n=2:3.6/64.468=approx 0.0558 →5.58%.

n=3:22.68/64.468≈0.352 →35.2%.

n=4:36.288/64.468≈0.563 →56.3%.

Wait, but wait. The sum of all these fractions should be 100%. Let me add them:

1.551 +1.397=2.948; +5.58=8.528; +35.2=43.728; +56.3=99.028.

Hmm, missing about 0.972%, probably due to rounding errors. But that's okay.

So, the fraction for n=2 is about 5.58%. But that's not matching any of the options. The options are 16.9%, 25.6%, 38.1%, 42.3%.

Wait, that suggests I've done something wrong. Because the correct answer should be one of the options given.

Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the K_n calculations.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the β values. Maybe β_n is the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n), not the stepwise. But the problem states 'stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16.' So, probably each βn is the stepwise constant for the nth ligand.

Wait, but perhaps β_n is the overall constant, not stepwise. That would change the calculations. Let me consider that possibility.

If βn is the overall K for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n), then β1=9 is for n=1, β2=40 for n=2, etc.

In that case, the overall K for each species would be βn, not the product.

Wait, but that's a different approach. Let's try that.

So, for each species, K_n = βn.

So, n=0: K0=1.

n=1: K1=9.

n=2: K2=40.

n=3: K3=63.

n=4: K4=16.

Wait, but that seems odd because K should increase with each addition, but here K3=63 is higher than K2=40, but K4=16 is lower than K3. Hmm, that seems a bit weird, but perhaps that's the case.

Wait, but wait. The overall K for the complex is the stepwise β multiplied by the previous K. So, if βn is the stepwise, then K_n = β1*β2*...*βn. So, I think I did it right earlier.

But if the problem gives βn as the overall K for [Co(SCN)_n], then that's different. Let me think: if βn for [Co(SCN)_n] is given, then K_n = βn.

So, for n=1, K1=9.

n=2, K2=40.

n=3, K3=63.

n=4, K4=16.

But then, the overall fraction would be calculated using K_n = βn, not the product. So, let's recalculate the terms.

So, for each n, the term is K_n * [L]^n.

[L] is 0.1.

So:

n=0: 1 *1=1.

n=1:9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2:40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

n=3:63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

n=4:16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

Sum all the terms: 1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So, denominator is approximately 2.3646.

Now, the fraction for each species:

n=0:1/2.3646 ≈0.4226 →42.26%.

n=1:0.9/2.3646≈0.381 →38.1%.

n=2:0.4/2.3646≈0.169 →16.9%.

n=3:0.063/2.3646≈0.0266 →2.66%.

n=4:0.0016/2.3646≈0.000676 →0.068%.

Wait, but the sum would be 42.26 +38.1=80.36 +16.9=97.26 +2.66=99.92 +0.068=100% approximately.

So, the fraction for n=2 is 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. If the blue is the n=2 complex, then the answer would be 16.9% which is option D.

But wait, earlier, when considering the K_n as the product of βs up to n, the fraction was about 5.5%, but that's not matching the options. So, perhaps the problem uses βn as the overall K, not stepwise.

But wait, why would β4 be 16, which is less than β3=63. Because if you have a higher n, you'd expect higher K, but in this case, K4=16 is lower than K3=63. That suggests that perhaps the higher complexes are less stable than the lower ones, which is unusual but possible.

But this leads to option D being 16.9%, which is one of the choices. But wait, the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So, β4 is lower than β3, which might imply that the fourth complex is less stable than the third.

But according to the fractions calculated with each βn as the overall K, the fraction for n=2 is 16.9%, which is option D.

Hmm, but wait, the way the problem describes the stability constants. The term 'stability constant' typically refers to the overall equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex, not the stepwise. So, perhaps the βn given are the overall K for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n), not the stepwise β.

So, if that's the case, then the calculation I did earlier (with K_n=βn) leads to the fraction of n=2 (dithiocyanato complex) being approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, looking back at the problem statement, the given βs are the stability constants, which are typically the overall constants. So maybe the approach is correct.

In that case, the answer would be 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, earlier when I assumed the K_n is the product of the βs, the fraction was about 5.5%, which doesn't match any options. So perhaps the correct approach is to take βn as the overall K for [Co(SCN)_n].

So, with that, the correct answer is D) 16.9%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the equilibrium distribution of cobalt complexes using the given stability constants (β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, β4 = 16) and the ligand concentration [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

### Key Assumptions and Approach:
1. **Stability Constants**: The problem specifies the stability constants (βn) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes. These constants are interpreted as the overall equilibrium constants for the formation of each complex, not the stepwise constants. Thus, the overall formation constant for each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) is directly given by βn.

2. **Fraction of Each Species**: The fraction of each cobalt species is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   f_n = \frac{K_n [L]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^{4} K_m [L]^m}
   \]
   where \( K_n = \beta_n \) is the equilibrium constant for the nth complex, \([L] = [SCN^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M}\), and the summation includes all possible cobalt species.

3. **Species and Calculations**:
   - For \( n = 0 \): \( K_0 = 1 \), term = \( 1 \cdot (0.1)^0 = 1 \).
   - For \( n = 1 \): \( K_1 = 9 \), term = \( 9 \cdot (0.1)^1 = 0.9 \).
   - For \( n = 2 \): \( K_2 = 40 \), term = \( 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \).
   - For \( n = 3 \): \( K_3 = 63 \), term = \( 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \).
   - For \( n = 4 \): \( K_4 = 16 \), term = \( 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \).

   Summing these terms gives the denominator:
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

4. **Fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]**:
   The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)_2]) is:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{K_2 [L]^2}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169 \, \text{or} \, 16.9\%.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.

ANSWER: D
