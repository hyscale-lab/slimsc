Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li typically has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6? Because 3 protons and 3 neutrons gives a mass number of 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Oh yeah, Li has isotopes. Li-6 is a common isotope with 3 neutrons, so that's right.

So the problem is about relativistic energy. The speed is given as 0.96c, which is pretty high, so relativistic effects are definitely significant here. I remember that the total energy of a relativistic particle is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So I need to find gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me calculate gamma first. v is 0.96c, so v² is (0.96)^2 c². So 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 divided by 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. Let me calculate sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? Yeah, 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So yes, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approx 3.57142857. So about 3.5714.

Now, the next step is to find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy E_rest is m*c², where m is the rest mass. Wait, but I need the mass of Li-6. How do I find that?

I recall that the mass of a nucleus can be approximated using the atomic mass. For Li-6, the atomic mass is approximately 6.013 atomic mass units (u). Wait, I think the exact value is about 6.013 u. Let me confirm. Oh, I think that's right. So, 1 atomic mass unit is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

But wait, I might need the exact value for accurate calculation. Alternatively, I can use the conversion factor where 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c². So 1 u equals approximately 931.5 million electron volts divided by the speed of light squared. But since we're dealing with energy, and E_rest = m*c², using the u to MeV conversion is easier.

So, for Li-6, mass is 6.013 u. Multiply by 931.5 MeV/u to get the rest energy in MeV. Let me compute that.

6.013 * 931.5 = Let's calculate step by step. 6 * 931.5 is 5589. Then 0.013 *931.5 is 12.11. So total is approximately 5589 +12.11 = 5601.11 MeV. Wait, but wait, 6.013 is 6 + 0.013, so yeah, 6*931.5 is 5589, 0.013 *931.5 is 12.1095. So 5589 +12.1095 = 5601.1095 MeV. So approximately 5601.11 MeV, which is 5.60111 GeV.

Wait, because 1 GeV is 10^3 MeV. So 5601.11 MeV is 5.60111 GeV.

So E_rest = 5.60111 GeV.

Now, the total energy E = gamma * E_rest.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714, so E = 3.5714 * 5.60111 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.5714 *5.60111.

Let me calculate:

3 *5.60111 is 16.80333.

0.5714 *5.60111.

Wait, 0.5 *5.60111 is 2.800555.

0.0714 *5.60111 is about 0.0714 *5 = 0.357, 0.0714 *0.60111 is approximately 0.0429. So total about 0.357 + 0.0429 = 0.3999.

So 2.800555 +0.3999 is approximately 3.20045.

So adding 16.80333 and 3.20045 gives 19. So 16.80333 +3.20045 = 20.00378 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.004 GeV.

Wait, but wait, let me do it more accurately.

3.5714 *5.60111.

Breaking it down: 3 *5.60111= 16.80333.

0.5714 *5.60111.

Let me compute 5.60111 * 0.5 = 2.800555.

5.60111 *0.0714.

Hmm, 5.60111 *0.07 = 0.3920777.

5.60111 *0.0014 = approximately 0.007841554.

So 0.3920777 +0.007841554 = 0.39991925.

So 2.800555 +0.39991925 = 3.19947425.

So total is 16.80333 +3.19947425 = approx 19.9998 GeV, which is approximately 20 GeV.

So about 20 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, option D is 21.419 GeV, option B is 23.069, and A is 18.475.

Wait, but I'm getting approximately 20 GeV, but none of the options exactly match. Hmm. Wait, perhaps my approximation for gamma was too rough.

Let me compute gamma more precisely.

v = 0.96c.

So beta (β) is 0.96.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²).

So 1 - beta² = 1 - 0.96^2.

0.96^2 is 0.9216, so 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

Wait, but maybe the exact value of 1/sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 3.57142857? Let me verify.

Yes, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So 1/0.28 is 3.57142857.

But perhaps I should compute this more accurately. Alternatively, maybe the calculation of the rest mass energy is a bit off.

Wait, I used 6.013 u for Li-6. Let me double-check that. The actual atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.013 atomic mass units. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the exact mass is a little different. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I should use the exact value of the mass.

Wait, wait, another approach. Let me think about the calculation:

E = gamma * m c^2.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)).

So 0.96^2 is 0.9216, 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

So E = 3.57142857 * (mass of Li-6 in GeV).

Earlier, I calculated mass as 6.013 u, which is 6.013 * 931.5 MeV = 6.013 *0.9315 GeV.

Wait, wait no, 931.5 MeV/u is 0.9315 GeV/u.

So 6.013 u *0.9315 GeV/u = ?

Calculating 6 * 0.9315 GeV = 5.589 GeV.

0.013 *0.9315 GeV = 0.0121095 GeV.

Adding together: 5.589 + 0.0121095 = 5.6011095 GeV.

So the rest energy is 5.6011095 GeV.

So, gamma is 3.57142857.

Multiply that by 5.6011095 GeV.

So 3.57142857 *5.6011095 = ?

Let me compute this precisely.

3.57142857 *5.6011095.

Let me break it down:

3.57142857 is approximately 25/7, since 25/7 is about 3.57142857.

Wait, 25/7 is 3 and 4/7, which is 3.57142857.

So 25/7 * 5.6011095.

25/7 *5.6011095.

Let me compute 25 *5.6011095 = 140.0277375.

Then divide by 7: 140.0277375 /7 = approximately 20.0039625 GeV.

So about 20.004 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest one is option C: 20.132 GeV, but wait, that's a bit higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, did I miscalculate the gamma? Let's recalculate gamma.

Wait, 0.96^2 is 0.9216. So 1 -0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the square root more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) precisely.

Wait, 0.0784 is between (0.28)^2=0.0784 exactly. So sqrt is exactly 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857142857.

So, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the rest mass energy.

Wait, another thought: the atomic mass might be more precise. Li-6's exact atomic mass is 6.01316 u, perhaps?

Wait, I think the exact value for Li-6 is approximately 6.01316 atomic mass units.

Ah, yes, so 6.01316 u. So let me calculate that.

So 6.01316 u * 931.5 MeV/u = ?

6.01316 * 931.5 = Let's compute.

6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.01316 *931.5 = 0.01316 *900=11.844, 0.01316*31.5= approx 0.41534. So total 11.844 +0.41534 =12.25934.

So total is 5589 +12.25934 = 5601.25934 MeV.

Convert to GeV: 5601.25934 MeV = 5.60125934 GeV.

So E_rest =5.60125934 GeV.

Multiply by gamma 3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 *5.60125934.

Let me compute this more accurately.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.60125934.

Break it down:

3 *5.60125934 = 16.80377802.

0.57142857 *5.60125934.

0.5 *5.60125934 = 2.80062967.

0.07142857 *5.60125934.

Compute 5.60125934 *0.07 = 0.392088154.

5.60125934 *0.00142857.

Hmm, 0.00142857 is approximately 1/700.

5.60125934 /700 = approx 0.008001799.

So 0.392088154 +0.008001799 = 0.399, approximately 0.399.

So 0.07142857 *5.60125934 ≈ 0.399.

So total for 0.57142857 *5.60125934 is 2.80062967 +0.399 = 3.19962967.

So total energy is 16.80377802 +3.19962967 = 19.99940769 GeV, which is approximately 20.0 GeV.

But looking at the options, the closest is C) 20.132 GeV and D) 21.419 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the mass. Let me make sure.

Wait, maybe I should use more precise values for the atomic mass of Li-6.

Wait, I think the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.01316 u. Let me check online. Wait, but I can't look it up, so I'll proceed with that assumption.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different approach, perhaps using the rest mass of a proton and neutron, building the nucleus.

Wait, the nucleus is Li-6, which is 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton has a rest mass of about 938.272 MeV/c², and neutrons about 939.565 MeV/c².

So the total rest mass would be 3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) MeV.

Wait, but wait, that's not the right approach because the mass of a nucleus is less than the sum due to binding energy, but for heavy ions, the mass of the nucleus is approximately the sum of the individual nucleons' masses minus the binding energy.

Wait, but in relativistic terms, the rest mass is what's important. Alternatively, perhaps the question is treating the nucleus as a particle with mass equal to the sum of the masses of its constituent nucleons, but that's not correct because of the mass defect due to binding energy.

Hmm, but perhaps the problem expects us to consider the nucleus as a single particle with mass equal to the sum of its nucleons' masses. Let me try that approach.

Each proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², each neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c².

So 3 protons: 3 *938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.

3 neutrons: 3 *939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.

Total: 2814.816 +2818.695 =5633.511 MeV, which is 5.633511 GeV.

So E_rest =5.633511 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E =3.57142857 *5.633511.

Calculating this:

3 *5.633511 =16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511.

0.5 *5.633511 =2.8167555.

0.07142857 *5.633511 ≈ 0.07142857 *5.633511.

Let me compute that:

5.633511 *0.07 =0.39434577.

5.633511 *0.00142857 ≈ 0.0080335.

Total ≈0.39434577 +0.0080335 ≈0.39434577 +0.0080335 =0.39434577 +0.0080335 ≈0.402379.

So 0.57142857 *5.633511 ≈ 2.8167555 +0.402379 ≈3.2191345.

So total E is 16.900533 +3.2191345 ≈20.1196675 GeV.

So approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, why the discrepancy between the two methods? Because in the first approach, I used the exact atomic mass of Li-6 (6.01316 u), which gave me about 20.0 GeV, but when I sum the individual nucleon masses, I got about 20.1197 GeV, which is closer to option C.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to sum the individual masses of protons and neutrons, ignoring the binding energy. Because using the exact atomic mass would give a lower energy, but perhaps the question uses the sum of individual masses.

Alternatively, maybe the exact gamma calculation was a bit off. Let me compute gamma again to more precision.

gamma =1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28=3.5714285714.

But perhaps the exact value should be computed using more accurate calculation.

Wait, 0.96^2 is exactly 0.9216.

So 1 -0.9216 =0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 (since 0.28^2=0.0784).

So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So when I took the rest mass as 5.633511 GeV (summing protons and neutrons), the total energy becomes 3.57142857 *5.633511 ≈20.1196 GeV, which rounds to about 20.12 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. That's very close. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

Wait, but why the difference between the two approaches? Because in reality, the atomic mass of Li-6 is less than the sum of individual nucleons due to the mass defect (binding energy). So using the exact atomic mass would give a lower rest mass and thus a lower total energy. But perhaps the problem is not considering the binding energy and simply uses the sum of the nucleon masses.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value of the atomic mass.

Wait, let me compute using the exact rest mass.

If I use Li-6 mass as 6.01316 u.

So m =6.01316 u.

E_rest =6.01316 *931.5 MeV/u.

Compute 6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.01316 *931.5 = let's calculate:

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.00316 *931.5= approx 2.938.

So total 9.315 +2.938=12.253 MeV.

Total E_rest =5589 +12.253 =5601.253 MeV =5.601253 GeV.

So E_rest =5.601253 GeV.

E = gamma * E_rest =3.57142857 *5.601253.

Let me compute that:

3 *5.601253 =16.803759.

0.57142857 *5.601253.

0.5 *5.601253 =2.8006265.

0.07142857 *5.601253 = let's compute.

5.601253 *0.07 =0.39208771.

5.601253 *0.00142857 = approximately 0.0080016.

So total for 0.07142857 *5.601253 is 0.39208771 +0.0080016 = 0.40008931.

So 0.57142857 *5.601253 ≈2.8006265 +0.40008931 =3.2007158.

So total E =16.803759 +3.2007158 ≈20.0044748 GeV.

Approximately 20.0045 GeV.

The options don't have 20.0045, but option C is 20.132, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the nucleus is moving, so the energy is higher, but my calculation with the exact mass gives about 20 GeV, which is not any of the options except C and D. Hmm.

Wait, let me recheck the problem statement. It says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)" so that the speed is 0.96c. So the energy is the total energy of the nucleus, which is gamma*m*c².

Wait, but perhaps the problem is referring to the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. Oh wait, that's a possibility. Because sometimes in these problems, "energy" could refer to kinetic energy (KE) rather than total energy (E). But the problem says "energy of the RHIC", which is usually the total energy imparted to the particles, but I'm not entirely sure.

If the question is asking for the kinetic energy, then KE = (gamma -1) * m c².

In that case, let's compute KE.

Gamma was 3.57142857.

So KE = (3.57142857 -1) *5.601253 GeV.

3.57142857 -1 =2.57142857.

Multiply by 5.601253:

2.57142857 *5.601253 ≈?

Let me compute:

2 *5.601253 =11.202506.

0.57142857 *5.601253 ≈3.200715 (as before).

So total KE =11.202506 +3.200715 =14.403221 GeV.

But looking at the options, 14.403 GeV isn't an option. So perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the total energy.

Wait, but none of the options exactly match 20 GeV, but option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. I must have made an error somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the mass of Li-6.

Wait, I think the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.01316 u. So let me compute that again.

6.01316 u *931.5 MeV/u = ?

6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.01316 *931.5.

0.01 *931.5 =9.315 MeV.

0.00316 *931.5 = 2.938 MeV.

So total 5589 +9.315 +2.938 =5601.253 MeV, which is 5.601253 GeV.

So E_rest =5.601253 GeV.

Multiply by gamma 3.57142857:

3.57142857 *5.601253.

Let me compute this more precisely.

3.57142857 ×5.601253.

I'll do this multiplication step by step.

Compute 3 *5.601253 =16.803759.

Compute 0.57142857 *5.601253.

0.57142857 is approximately 4/7.

But let's compute it:

0.5 *5.601253 =2.8006265.

0.07142857 *5.601253 = let me compute 5.601253 *0.07142857.

We can compute 5.601253 * (1/14) = 5.601253 /14 ≈0.4000895.

So 0.57142857 *5.601253 ≈2.8006265 +0.4000895 ≈3.200716.

Adding that to 3 *5.601253: 16.803759 +3.200716 =20.004475 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.004 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV, but that's 0.128 GeV higher. Hmm. This suggests I might have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is not 6 u but something else. Let me think again.

Wait, the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons, so Li-6.

But perhaps I should double-check the mass of Li-6.

Upon reflection, perhaps the precise mass is 6.01316 u, which is correct. So perhaps the correct calculation is about 20 GeV, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy but in a different way. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of momentum or other relativistic equations.

Wait, another approach: the total energy is gamma m c², and the momentum is gamma m v.

But perhaps the problem is using the relation between kinetic energy and momentum, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the exact gamma.

Wait, perhaps the exact gamma is a bit more precise. Let me compute gamma with more precision.

v =0.96c → beta =0.96.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714285714.

So gamma is exactly 25/7, which is 3.5714285714285714.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the mass of Li-6.

Wait, maybe using the exact atomic mass, but let me check. The exact mass of Li-6 is 6.01316 u. So the calculation seems correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem uses the rest mass as 6 u, not 6.01316 u.

If I use m =6 u, then E_rest =6 *931.5 MeV=5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

E =gamma *5.589 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

3.57142857 *5.589 =?

3 *5.589 =16.767.

0.57142857 *5.589 ≈3.199 GeV.

So total E ≈16.767 +3.199=20. So about 20 GeV.

But again, the options don't have exactly 20.

Wait, maybe I should compute 3.57142857 *5.589 GeV.

Let me compute precisely:

3.57142857 *5.589.

3 *5.589=16.767.

0.57142857 *5.589.

Compute 5.589 *0.57142857.

Let me compute:

5.589 *0.5 =2.7945.

5.589 *0.07142857 ≈0.5589 *0.7142857.

Wait, 5.589 *0.07 =0.39123.

5.589 *0.00142857 ≈0.00796.

So 0.39123 +0.00796 ≈0.40019.

So 0.57142857 *5.589 ≈2.7945 + 0.40019 =3.19469.

So total E =16.767 +3.19469=20. (Approx 19.96169 GeV.)

No, that's about 19.96 GeV.

Hmm, but the options don't have that either.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using more precise values for gamma and the rest mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value of sqrt(0.0784) and compute gamma to more decimal places.

Wait, but 0.28 is exact, so gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is mixing up the units. Let me think.

Wait, the options are in GeV, which is 1e9 eV, but perhaps I should ensure that the calculations are done correctly in terms of units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use exact decimal representations.

Wait, but I think I've tried all possible approaches.

Wait, perhaps when the problem says 'energy of the RHIC', it refers to the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Let me calculate the kinetic energy again.

KE = (gamma -1) m c².

gamma is 3.57142857.

So KE = (2.57142857) *5.601253 GeV.

Compute:

2 *5.601253 =11.202506 GeV.

0.57142857 *5.601253 ≈3.200716 GeV.

Total KE ≈11.202506 +3.200716 =14.403222 GeV.

Again, this doesn't match any option.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the nucleus is moving at 0.96c, and the problem is using the more precise calculation for gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, v =0.96c.

beta =0.96.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).

Compute 1 - beta^2 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28.

So gamma is exactly 3.571428571428571.

Another approach: perhaps the rest mass is given as 6.01316 u, but when multiplied by 931.5 MeV/u, the exact calculation is 6.01316 *931.5.

Wait, 6 *931.5 =5589.

0.01316 *931.5 = let's compute precisely.

0.01 *931.5 =9.315.

0.00316 *931.5 = 2.93844.

So total is 9.315 +2.93844=12.25344 MeV.

So E_rest is 5589 +12.25344 =5601.25344 MeV =5.60125344 GeV.

Multiply by gamma 3.57142857:

3.57142857 *5.60125344.

Let me compute this exactly.

3.57142857 *5.60125344.

Break it down into:

3 *5.60125344 =16.80376032.

0.57142857 *5.60125344.

Compute 0.5 *5.60125344 =2.80062672.

0.07142857 *5.60125344 = ?

Compute 5.60125344 *0.07142857.

5.60125344 *0.07 =0.39208774.

5.60125344 *0.00142857 ≈0.0080016.

So total is 0.39208774 +0.0080016 ≈0.40008934.

So 0.57142857 *5.60125344 =2.80062672 +0.40008934 ≈3.20071606.

So total E =16.80376032 +3.20071606 =20.00447638 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.0045 GeV.

But the options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

Hmm, none is exactly 20.0045 GeV. But option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.1275 GeV higher. Perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is higher. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the nucleus is actually moving, and the rest mass is calculated differently. Wait no, the rest mass is fixed.

Wait, maybe the initial calculation of the rest mass should have included the binding energy, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass as 6 u, not considering any binding energy.

Wait, if I use m=6 u, E_rest=6 *931.5=5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

Compute E =gamma *5.589.

Gamma=3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 *5.589 = let me compute precisely.

3.57142857 *5.589.

Let me compute:

3 *5.589 =16.767.

0.57142857 *5.589 = ?

0.5 *5.589 =2.7945.

0.07142857 *5.589 ≈0.40007.

So total ≈2.7945 +0.40007 =3.19457.

So E=16.767 +3.19457=19.96157 GeV.

Approximately 19.9616 GeV.

Again, this doesn't match any option.

Hmm, perhaps I should look at the options again. The options are A) 18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

Only option C is close to 20 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should have used the exact value of gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Beta is 0.96.

gamma=1.0 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1.0 / sqrt(0.0784) =1.0 /0.28 =3.5714285714285714.

But perhaps the exact calculation of gamma with more precision.

Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, so gamma is exactly 3.571428571428571.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass energy was calculated more precisely.

Wait, let me compute 6.01316 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

6.01316 *931.5 = ?

Let me compute:

6.01316 * 900 =5411.844.

6.01316 *31.5 = let's compute.

6.01316 *30 =180.3948.

6.01316 *1.5 =9.01974.

So 180.3948 +9.01974=189.41454.

So total 5411.844 +189.41454 =5601.25854 MeV =5.60125854 GeV.

So E_rest=5.60125854 GeV.

E=gamma *E_rest =3.57142857 *5.60125854.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.57142857 *5.60125854.

Compute as:

3 *5.60125854 =16.80377562.

0.57142857 *5.60125854.

Compute 0.5 *5.60125854 =2.80062927.

0.07142857 *5.60125854 = ?

5.60125854 *0.07 =0.392088098.

5.60125854 *0.00142857 = approximately 0.0080016.

So 0.392088098 +0.0080016 =0.400089698.

So 0.57142857 *5.60125854 =2.80062927 +0.400089698 =3.200718968.

So total E =16.80377562 +3.200718968 =20.004494588 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.0045 GeV.

But again, the options don't include this. So perhaps the intended answer is option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approximation for gamma, such as using a more precise calculation for 1/sqrt(1-0.96^2).

Wait, let me compute 1 -0.96^2 more precisely.

Wait, 0.96^2 is 0.9216.

So 1-0.9216=0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

Hmm, but to compute gamma more precisely, perhaps using a Taylor expansion or another method.

Wait, perhaps I should compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately.

Wait, 0.28^2=0.0784 exactly.

So gamma is exactly 3.5714285714285714.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the rest mass of the nucleus as 6.013 u, leading to 5.601 GeV, and then gamma *5.601 =3.57142857 *5.601=?

3.57142857 *5.601:

3 *5.601=16.803.

0.57142857 *5.601=3.199.

Total 19.999 GeV.

So 20 GeV.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the nucleus is a heavy ion, and the energy is given per nucleon or something else. Hmm, but the question specifies the energy of the nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the nucleus is a deuteron or something else, but no, it's Li-6.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass was calculated incorrectly. Let me think. The mass of Li-6 is 6.01316 u, so E_rest=6.01316 *931.5 =5601.253 MeV =5.601253 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct calculation leads to option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma with more decimal places.

Wait, gamma is 3.5714285714285714.

So, 3.5714285714285714 *5.60125344 GeV.

Let me compute this precisely:

3.5714285714285714 *5.60125344.

Let me compute this using a calculator-like approach.

3.5714285714285714 ×5.60125344.

Compute 3 *5.60125344 =16.80376032.

0.5714285714285714 ×5.60125344.

Compute:

0.5 *5.60125344 =2.80062672.

0.0714285714285714 ×5.60125344.

Compute 5.60125344 ×0.0714285714285714.

Let me compute 5.60125344 ÷14 =0.4000895314285714.

So 0.0714285714285714 ×5.60125344 =0.4000895314285714.

So 0.5714285714285714 ×5.60125344 =2.80062672 +0.4000895314285714 =3.2007162514285714.

So total E =16.80376032 +3.2007162514285714 =20.00447657142857 GeV.

So about 20.00447657 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.0045 GeV.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for c or another constant, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass energy. Let me recheck.

Li-6 has a mass of 6.01316 u.

1 u =931.5 MeV/c².

So 6.01316 u ×931.5 MeV/u = ?

6 ×931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.01316 ×931.5 =12.25344 MeV.

Total 5601.25344 MeV =5.60125344 GeV.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, given all this, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the intended answer is option C: 20.132 GeV, perhaps due to a miscalculation in the problem setup.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recompute gamma using more precise methods.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator, gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28=3.5714285714.

But another calculation using more precise beta:

Beta =0.96.

Gamma =1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784) =3.5714285714.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using a different approach, like the total relativistic energy formula E=gamma m c², but perhaps the mass is taken as 6.941 u (the atomic mass of Li, but that's for Li-7).

Wait, no, the problem states it's Li with 3 neutrons, so Li-6.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on all calculations, the energy is approximately 20 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV. Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.60125344 with more precision.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.60125344.

Using a calculator approach:

5.60125344 ×3.57142857.

Let me compute 5.60125344 ×3 =16.80376032.

5.60125344 ×0.57142857.

Compute 5.60125344 ×0.5 =2.80062672.

5.60125344 ×0.07142857 =0.4000895314.

So 5.60125344 ×0.57142857 =2.80062672 +0.4000895314 =3.2007162514.

Total E=16.80376032 +3.2007162514 =20.0044765714 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.0045 GeV.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation once more.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the relativistic energy formula with the rest mass as 6 u, leading to a higher energy.

E_rest =6 u *931.5 MeV/u =5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

E =3.57142857 *5.589 = ?

Let me compute:

3.57142857 *5.589.

3 *5.589 =16.767.

0.57142857 *5.589.

Compute 5.589 ×0.5 =2.7945.

5.589 ×0.07142857.

5.589 ×0.07 =0.39123.

5.589 ×0.00142857 ≈0.008.

So 0.39123 +0.008 =0.40023.

So 0.57142857 *5.589 =2.7945 +0.40023 =3.19473.

So E=16.767 +3.19473=19.96173 GeV.

No, that's about 19.96 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is C:20.132 GeV.

But based on all calculations, I think the correct answer is approximately 20.0 GeV, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nucleus is moving, so the total energy is gamma m c², but maybe the problem is using the rest mass in kilograms and then using c² as (3e8 m/s)^2.

But that would require a lot of unit conversions and is unlikely to change the result significantly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value using more precise constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be option C:20.132 GeV.

After all, in the calculation where I summed the individual nucleon masses, I obtained approximately 20.1197 GeV, which is very close to option C.

So, perhaps the intended answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus \( X \) (Li-6) is \( 0.96c \), we use relativistic energy principles. The total energy \( E \) of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute \( \gamma \):
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of Li-6
The rest mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.01316 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Thus:
\[
E_{\text{rest}} = 6.01316 \, \text{u} \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV/u} = 5601.253 \, \text{MeV} = 5.601253 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
The total energy is:
\[
E = \gamma E_{\text{rest}} = 3.5714 \times 5.601253 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:
\[
3 \times 5.601253 = 16.803759 \, \text{GeV}
\]
\[
0.5714 \times 5.601253 \approx 3.200716 \, \text{GeV}
\]
\[
E \approx 16.803759 + 3.200716 = 20.004475 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated total energy is approximately \( 20.0045 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:
- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too high.

### Conclusion
The closest option to the calculated energy is **C) 20.132 GeV**, likely due to rounding or slight differences in the problem's assumptions.

Answer: C
