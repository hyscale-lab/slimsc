Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the SMEFT. Hmm, SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? I remember that effective field theories are used when you have some high-energy physics that's not accessible at lower energies, so you write down all possible interactions up to a certain energy scale.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices given are combinations of these.

Wait, first, what's the deal with these symmetries? I think Lorentz symmetry is about how the laws of physics look the same in all reference frames moving at constant velocities relative to each other. Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, so it's the symmetry of special relativity. CP symmetry is Charge conjugation (C) and Parity (P) together. CPT is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal symmetry. I remember that CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories, especially in theories that are Lorentz invariant.

So the question is about which of these symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect. SMEFT is an effective theory of the Standard Model. Wait, the Standard Model itself has certain symmetries. I think the Standard Model is Lorentz symmetric, but does it respect all the other symmetries?

Wait, the Standard Model is actually CPT symmetric. Because all the particles have their antiparticles, and the interactions are symmetric under CPT. But the Standard Model isn't CP symmetric on its own because of things like CP violation in the CKM matrix. So SMEFT being an effective theory of the SM, I guess it would inherit some of these symmetries.

But wait, the question is about what symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. So the operators must be invariant under certain symmetries. All operators in the SMEFT must respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model, I think. Because if an operator doesn't respect a symmetry, like CPT, the theory as a whole might not be consistent.

Wait, but wait. SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the SM Lagrangian. These operators must respect the symmetries of the SM, or else they would break those symmetries. So operators like (1/Lambda) (some SM fields)^n must not break the SM's symmetries.

So which SM symmetries are these? The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry (since it's a relativistic theory), and CPT symmetry. But does it respect CP symmetry? No, because there's CP violation. So the operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT symmetries but not necessarily CP. Because if an operator breaks CP, that's allowed in the SM as it already has CP violation.

Wait wait, but the question is which must be respected by all operators. So, operators must be CPT invariant. Because CPT is a bigger symmetry. But do they have to respect Poincare? Because Poincare includes Lorentz and translations, but SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so yes.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about Poincare symmetry. Because in SMEFT, the operators are classified according to their dimension. But Poincare symmetry (which includes translations) is automatically satisfied because the SM Lagrangian is translationally invariant, and the SMEFT operators are just adding higher-dimension terms, which also are translationally invariant.

So in SMEFT, the operators must be Lorentz scalars. Therefore, they must respect Lorentz symmetry. They must also respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz. But wait, is Poincare a separate symmetry here? Because Poincare includes both Lorentz and translations, and if the operators are built from SM fields, which are already Poincare invariant, then yes, SMEFT operators should respect Poincare.

Wait, but sometimes Poincare is considered a global symmetry, but no, it's local. Wait, Poincare symmetry is the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime—translations, Lorentz transformations, etc. So any operator in the theory must be invariant under Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz.

So, the SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (so they are Lorentz scalars) and Poincare symmetry.

Wait, but what about CPT? Since the Standard Model is CPT invariant, the SMEFT operators must also be CPT invariant. So any operator in SMEFT must be a CPT eigenstate and the overall theory must maintain CPT symmetry.

What about CP? Since the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, the SMEFT operators don't have to preserve CP. For example, operators that violate CP would be allowed, as the SM already does that.

So the question is which symmetries must be respected. So options are 1,2,4.

Wait, the question lists four options: 1. Lorentz, 2. Poincare, 3. CP, 4. CPT.

So the correct symmetries that must be respected by all operators are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT) symmetry.

So looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Option C is one of the presented options.

Wait the options:

A) 1,2 → Lorentz and Poincare. But what about CPT?

B)3,4 → CP and CPT. But why would they have to respect CP? Because SM doesn't require that.

C) 1,2,4 → all three.

D) 1,3,4 → Lorentz, CP, CPT.

So the correct answer is C: 1,2,4. Because SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT symmetries.

Wait, but wait. I thought Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So if Poincare is respected, then Lorentz is automatically respected. So perhaps the question is which must be respected, but the answer includes both Lorentz and Poincare as separate points.

In any case, the options are as presented, so the correct answer is option C:1,2,4.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an effective field theory constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model (SM) Lagrangian. These operators must respect the symmetries of the SM to maintain consistency. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This symmetry ensures that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames. Since the SM and SMEFT are relativistic theories, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: This symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since the SM Lagrangian is translationally invariant and SMEFT operators are constructed from SM fields, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not respect CP symmetry due to CP violation (e.g., in the CKM matrix). Therefore, SMEFT operators are not required to preserve CP symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM is CPT-invariant, and SMEFT inherits this property. All operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not required to be preserved.

**Correct Answer**: C) 1,2,4.
