Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to find the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, relativistic, so that probably means I can't use classical mechanics equations all the way. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says it's a relativistic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, this is relativistic, so maybe some energy considerations change.

In the non-relativistic case, the potential energy at maximum displacement (x = A) is (1/2)kA². That converts entirely into kinetic energy, which is (1/2)mv². So solving for v, you get v = sqrt(kA²/m). Looking at the options, option C is exactly that. But wait, the question is relativistic, so the non-relativistic approach might not apply here.

Relativistic mechanics comes into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. The relativistic kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So maybe I need to equate the potential energy to the relativistic kinetic energy.

Wait, but in the relativistic case, does the potential energy expression change? I think so. Because in relativity, the concept of potential energy can be tricky. For a harmonic oscillator, the potential is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

So let's model this. At the maximum amplitude A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². At that point, the oscillator is at rest momentarily, so all energy is potential. Then as it moves towards the equilibrium point, this potential energy converts into kinetic energy. But in relativity, the total energy (kinetic plus rest mass) must be considered.

Wait, in the classical case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA². But in relativity, the total energy would be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So, I think the total energy E is (1/2)kA² + mc². But wait, wait, that might not be correct. Because in the classical case, the energy is purely (1/2)kA² and (1/2)mv², but in the relativistic case, the total energy would be γmc², which is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy.

Wait, so when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x = A), its velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. Then, at the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic. So the total energy E must be (1/2)kA², right? Or is it different in relativity?

Hmm, perhaps the potential energy is still (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc² at maximum speed. So the total energy at maximum speed would be (γ - 1)mc². But at maximum displacement, the energy is (1/2)kA². So setting these equal, because energy is conserved. So (1/2)kA² = (γ - 1)mc².

Wait, that might make sense. So, (1/2)kA² = (γ - 1)mc².

Let me solve for γ. γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²). Hmm, but wait, if kA² is much larger than mc², this might cause γ to be larger than 1, which is fine, but we need to find v in terms of c.

Then, γ is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, let's write that equation:

γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²) 

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²).

Let me rearrange that.

1 - v²/c² = 1 / [1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²)]².

So, 1 - v²/c² = [ (2 m c²) / (2 m c² + k A²) ) ]².

Wait, not exactly. Let me compute the denominator.

Let me write (kA²)/(2 m c²) as a term. Let me call it K for simplicity: K = (kA²)/(2 m c²).

So, γ = 1 + K.

Then, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + K.

So, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + K).

Square both sides: 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + K)^2.

Then, v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + K)^2.

Hmm, let me compute that.

v²/c² = [ (1 + K)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + K)^2 

Expand numerator: (1 + 2K + K² - 1) = 2K + K².

So,

v²/c² = (2K + K²) / (1 + K)^2.

Factor numerator: K(2 + K).

Denominator: (1 + K)^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ K(2 + K) ] / (1 + K)^2 )

= c * sqrt( K (2 + K) ) / (1 + K )

But K is (kA²)/(2 m c²), so let's plug that in.

K = (k A²) / (2 m c²).

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) * (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)) ) ] / [ 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]

Simplify numerator inside the square root:

Multiply numerator terms:

(k A²)/(2 m c²) * [ 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]

= [k A²/(2 m c²)] * [ (4 m c² + k A²) )/(2 m c²) ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to factor.

Let me factor out (k A²)/(2 m c²):

= (k A²)/(2 m c²) [1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²) ) ].

Wait, no, 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = 2 [ 1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²) ), but perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, let me take the expression for v:

v = c * sqrt( [ K (2 + K) ] ) / (1 + K )

Where K = (k A²) / (2 m c²).

Let me compute 2 + K = 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = [4 m c² + k A² ] / (2 m c²).

So, K (2 + K) = [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ] * [ (4 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]

= [k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ] / [ (2 m c²)^2 ]

Denominator (1 + K)^2 = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²) ) ]^2.

So, now the entire expression under the sqrt is:

[ K (2 + K) ] / (1 + K)^2 = [ numerator ] / denominator.

Where numerator is [k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ] / [ (2 m c²)^2 ]

Denominator is [ (2 m c² + k A² )^2 ] / (2 m c²)^2.

So when we divide numerator by denominator:

= [k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ) ] / (2 m c²)^2 * (2 m c²)^2 / ( (2 m c² + k A² )^2 )

The (2 m c²)^2 terms cancel.

Leaving: [k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ] / ( (2 m c² + k A² )^2 )

Hmm, perhaps factor 4 m c² + k A² = (2 m c² + k A² ) + 2 m c².

Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, let me see:

4 m c² = 2*(2 m c²), and the denominator is (2 m c² + k A² )^2.

Wait, perhaps if I factor the numerator as (2 m c² + k A² )*(something).

Wait, let me factor numerator:

k A² (4 m c² + k A²) = k A² [ (2 m c² + k A² ) + 2 m c² ]

= k A² [ (2 m c² + k A² ) + 2 m c² ]

= k A² ( (2 m c² + k A² ) + 2 m c² )

= k A² ( 2 m c² (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) )) )

Hmm, not sure if this is helpful.

Wait, perhaps we can write the numerator as:

k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) = k A² ( 2 m c² * 2 + k A² )

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to plug in K and see if any of the options match.

Wait, let's look at the options again.

Option A: v_max = c √[1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m ))^2 ]

Option B: v_max = c √[1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c² )) ]

Option D: v_max = c √[1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 ]

Hmm, our expression for v is in terms of K. Let me see if any of these match.

Wait, our v is:

v = c * sqrt( [ K (2 + K) ] / (1 + K )^2 )

Hmm, but that's not directly matching any of the options. Let me think about another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the conservation of energy in terms of total energy, which includes the rest mass. So, at x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E is (1/2)k A².

At x=0, the potential energy is zero, and all energy is kinetic. So the kinetic energy is (1/2)k A². But relativistic kinetic energy is (γ-1) m c². So,

(γ -1 ) m c² = (1/2) k A².

So,

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Which is the same as before. So,

γ = 1 + K, with K = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Then, as before,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + K.

So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + K )

Squaring both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + K )².

Rearranged,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + K )² ]

= [ (1 + K )² - 1 ] / (1 + K )².

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 K + K² ) - 1 = 2 K + K² = K (2 + K )

So,

v²/c² = K (2 + K ) / (1 + K )².

So,

v = c * sqrt( K (2 + K ) ) / (1 + K )

But K is (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A²)/(2 m c² ) ( 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )) ] ) / [ 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) ]

Let me factor (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) as K again. So,

v = c * sqrt( K (2 + K )) / (1 + K )

Hmm, perhaps manipulate this expression further.

Let me consider the numerator inside the square root: K (2 + K ) = K (2 + K ) = 2 K + K².

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2 K + K²) ) / (1 + K )

Hmm, perhaps factor K from numerator:

v = c * sqrt( K (2 + K ) ) / (1 + K )

Wait, maybe express numerator as K (2 + K ) = K (2 + K ) = same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps write this as:

sqrt( [ K (2 + K ) ] ) = sqrt( K ) * sqrt( 2 + K )

So,

v = c * sqrt(K) * sqrt(2 + K ) / (1 + K )

But K is (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Hmm, maybe it's better to express this in terms of the options given.

Looking at the options, option A involves a denominator (1 - (k A^2)/(2m)) which doesn't have c in it. That seems off because in relativity, the denominator should involve c² to keep the units correct.

Option B: sqrt[1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c² )) ].

Wait, let me compute 1/(1 - x) where x is (k A²)/(2 m c² ). So,

sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - x) ) = sqrt( (1 - x + 1 ) / (1 - x) ) ) = sqrt( (2 - x) / (1 - x) )

Hmm, not sure.

Option D: sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + x )^2 )

Where x = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

sqrt( [ (1 + x )^2 - 1 ) / (1 +x )^2 ] )

= sqrt( [ 1 + 2x + x² - 1 ] / (1 +x )^2 )

= sqrt( (2x + x²) / (1 +x )^2 )

= sqrt( x (2 + x ) ) / (1 + x )

Which matches our earlier expression for v/c.

Because,

v = c * sqrt( x (2 +x ) ) / (1 +x )

where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ( 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ] ) / [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]

Which is the same as option D's expression.

Wait, let me look at option D.

Option D says:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Wait, using x = (k A²)/(2 m c² ),

Then,

1 - 1/(1 + x )^2 = [ (1 + x )^2 - 1 ] / (1 +x )^2 

= [ 1 + 2x + x² -1 ] / (1 +x )^2 

= (2x + x²) / (1 +x )^2 

= x (2 + x ) / (1 +x )^2 

So,

sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 +x )^2 ) = sqrt( x (2 +x ) ) / (1 +x )

Which is exactly what our v/c is. So,

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + x )^2 )

So that's option D.

Wait, but let me check the other options again. Option B is v = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - x ) ), but that's not the same as our expression.

So I think the correct answer is option D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we must consider relativistic energy conservation. The total energy of the system is conserved and includes both potential energy and relativistic kinetic energy.

1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the potential energy is \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and the kinetic energy is zero. At the equilibrium point \( x = 0 \), all energy is kinetic. The total energy is thus:  
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( v \) is the maximum speed.

2. **Solving for \( \gamma \)**:  
   Rearranging the energy equation gives:  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we have:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]  
   Let \( x = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), so:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + x.
   \]

3. **Squaring Both Sides**:  
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + x}.
   \]  
   Squaring again:  
   \[
   1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{(1 + x)^2}.
   \]  
   Rearranging:  
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + x)^2}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( x = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):  
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options, it matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
