Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the question says it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The problem asks for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator's maximum speed is when the potential energy is zero, right? So at x=0, all energy is kinetic. But since this is relativistic, I can't use the classical formula directly. I remember that in relativity, the total energy is gamma times the rest energy, and kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc².

But wait, this is a relativistic oscillator, so maybe we're using the relativistic version of the harmonic oscillator equation. I think the force might still be F = -kx, but the equation of motion would be different. Let me think about the equation of motion for a relativistic oscillator.

In the non-relativistic case, the equation is F = m d²x/dt² = -kx, leading to x(t) = A cos(ωt), where ω = sqrt(k/m). The maximum speed would then be v_max = Aω = sqrt(k/m) * A. So the non-relativistic v_max is sqrt(k A² / m). Looking at the options, option C is that. But since this is a relativistic problem, option C is probably not the answer.

But wait, the problem says it's relativistic, so maybe relativistic effects are significant. Relativistic speeds would mean that as the mass moves, its kinetic energy can't be treated with the classical ½ mv² formula.

So, considering relativistic dynamics, the total energy E is gamma mc². The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)k A², right? Because at maximum displacement x = A, all energy is potential. So E_total = (1/2) k A².

Wait, no. Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the total energy is (1/2)k A². But in the relativistic case, the potential energy might be different, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the potential energy is still (1/2)k x², but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

So, when the oscillator is at x=0, all energy is kinetic. So the kinetic energy K is E_total = (1/2)k A². But wait, in the non-relativistic case, K = ½ mv_max². But in the relativistic case, K = (gamma - 1) mc².

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to set up the equations.

At the equilibrium point (x=0), the kinetic energy is maximum. The total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. But wait, actually, for a harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy is (1/2) k A², regardless of x. So when the oscillator is at x=0, all that energy is kinetic. So in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy K equals (1/2) k A².

Wait, that can't be right because in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So setting that equal to ½ k A²? Hmm.

So (gamma -1) mc² = (1/2) k A². Solving for gamma.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Let me write that equation:

(gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2) k A².

So, (gamma) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, but gamma is also 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So equating:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me square both sides to get rid of the square root.

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]².

Then, 1 - v²/c² = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]².

So v²/c² = 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))² ].

Wait, that's getting complicated. Let me compute 1 / [1 + a]^2 where a is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Alternatively, maybe there's a better way to approach this. Let's see.

Let me rearrange the equation:

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some variable, say, alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So 1/sqrt(1-v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

Then sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1+alpha).

So 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1+alpha)^2.

Then, v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1+alpha)^2].

Hmm, but that might not directly help me find v_max. Let me compute 1 - [1/(1+alpha)^2].

Wait, 1/(1+alpha)^2 = 1/(1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2) ≈ 1 - 2 alpha + ... if alpha is small. But in this case, since it's relativistic, alpha might not be small. So perhaps I should compute 1 - [1/(1+alpha)^2] as [ (1+alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1+alpha)^2.

Wait, let me compute:

1 - [1/(1+alpha)^2] = [ (1+alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1+alpha)^2.

(1+alpha)^2 = 1 + 2 alpha + alpha².

So numerator is 2 alpha + alpha².

So,

v²/c² = (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1+alpha)^2.

Factor numerator: alpha (2 + alpha) / (1+alpha)^2.

But alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let me write that as (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (1/(2 m c²)) k A². Wait, but that's a number.

Wait, perhaps I can find an expression for v in terms of alpha.

Alternatively, let me take the equation 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + alpha)^2.

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Then, v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, let me compute 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Wait, alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let's say that's a positive quantity.

So, 1/(1 + alpha)^2 = [1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))]^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))]^2.

Hmm. This seems a bit messy, but perhaps we can manipulate it further.

Alternatively, maybe I should have started with expressing the kinetic energy in terms of v.

Wait, let's think about the total energy. The total mechanical energy in the oscillator is (1/2) k A² in the non-relativistic case. But in the relativistic case, perhaps the potential energy is still (1/2) k x², but the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc².

So, at any point, the total energy is (1/2)k A² = (gamma -1) mc² + (1/2)k x².

But at x=0, the potential term is zero, so (1/2)k A² = (gamma -1) mc².

Which brings us back to the equation:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Which is the same as before.

So, the maximum speed occurs when x=0, so v is maximum.

So, from gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²), and gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c^2) as a parameter, say, beta.

So, beta = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Wait, but in the above equation, beta is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Hmm.

So now, 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + beta.

Then, sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1/(1 + beta).

Square both sides: 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + beta)^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + beta)^2].

Let me compute 1 - [1/(1+beta)^2].

1/(1+beta)^2 = [1/(1 + beta)]^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + beta)]^2.

Hmm, but perhaps we can write this as [ (1 + beta)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + beta)^2.

Which is ( (1 + 2 beta + beta^2) - 1 ) / (1 + beta)^2.

So,

(2 beta + beta^2) / (1 + beta)^2.

Factor numerator:

beta (2 + beta) / (1 + beta)^2.

Hmm, but that doesn't seem to immediately simplify.

Alternatively, perhaps we can factor the numerator:

2 beta + beta^2 = beta (2 + beta) = beta (beta + 2).

Denominator: (beta + 1)^2.

Hmm, not sure. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write v_max^2 as c² times [1 - 1/(1 + beta)^2].

Wait, let's compute 1 - [1/(1 + beta)]^2:

1 - [1/(1 + beta)^2] = [ (1 + beta)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + beta)^2.

Which is (1 + 2 beta + beta^2 - 1 ) / (1 + beta)^2 = (2 beta + beta²) / (1 + beta)^2.

So,

v_max^2 = c² (2 beta + beta^2) / (1 + beta)^2.

Factor numerator: beta (2 + beta) = beta (beta +2).

Wait, maybe factor beta + 2 as (beta + 1) +1.

Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as [beta (beta + 2)] / (beta +1)^2.

But let me see if any of the options resemble this.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m))² )

Wait, that's sqrt(1 + [1/(...)]^2 ) times c.

Hmm, let me compute 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m))^2.

But in our case, beta = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2). So 1 - (k A^2)/(2 m) = 1 - [ (2 m beta c^2) / (k A^2) ) * beta ]? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the denominator in option A is (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m)).

Wait, but (k A^2) / (2 m) is (1/(2 m c^2)) * k A^2 * c^2. Because beta is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2). Wait, beta is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) = [k A^2/(2 m)] * (1/c²).

So, [k A^2/(2 m)] = beta c².

So, 1 - (k A^2)/(2 m) = 1 - beta c².

Hmm, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the expression I have for v_max^2 and compare it to the options.

Let me write v_max^2 = c² (2 beta + beta²) / (1 + beta)^2.

Since beta is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2), let's substitute beta:

v_max^2 = c² [ 2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))^2 ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)))^2.

Simplify numerator:

2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) = (k A^2)/(m c^2).

So numerator becomes [ (k A^2)/(m c^2) ) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))^2 ].

Wait, perhaps factor (k A^2/(2 m c^2))^2 as (beta)^2.

But maybe expanding the denominator:

Denominator is (1 + beta)^2 = 1 + 2 beta + beta^2.

So,

v_max^2 = c² [ (k A²/(m c²)) + (k A²/(2 m c²))^2 ] / [ (1 + 2 beta + beta^2) ].

Hmm, maybe this isn't the easiest path. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 2 beta + beta^2.

2 beta + beta^2 = beta (2 + beta) = beta (1 + 1 + beta) = beta (1 + (1 + beta)).

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can factor the numerator and denominator:

The numerator is (k A^2)/(m c^2) ) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))^2.

Let me factor out (k A^2/(m c^2))^2:

Wait, wait:

Wait, (k A^2/(m c^2)) is 2 beta.

So,

2 beta + beta^2 = beta (2 + beta) = beta (beta + 2). Hmm.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I can factor it as beta (beta + 2) = beta (beta + 1 + 1) = beta ( (beta + 1) + 1 ).

Hmm, perhaps that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the entire expression.

Let me think about the denominator: (1 + beta)^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c^2) ) ]^2.

Wait, because beta is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2), so 1 + beta = [ 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ] / (2 m c^2).

So, squared, it's [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2)^2 ] / [ (2 m c^2)^2 ].

The numerator of v_max^2 is [ 2 beta + beta^2 ].

Which is 2*(k A^2)/(2 m c^2) + (k A^2)^2/(4 m² c^4).

So,

2 beta = (k A^2)/(m c^2).

beta^2 = (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

So,

2 beta + beta^2 = (k A^2)/(m c^2) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

Let me factor out (k A^2)/(4 m² c^4):

Wait, perhaps:

= (k A^2)/(4 m² c^4) [4 m c² + k A^2 ].

Because,

(k A^2)/(m c^2) = (4 m c^2 * k A^2 )/(4 m² c^4 ) = [4 m c^2 * k A² ] / denominator.

Wait, perhaps not the easiest approach.

Alternatively, let me compute 2 beta + beta^2:

= (k A^2)/(2 m c²) * 2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))^2.

= (k A^2)/(m c^2) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

Hmm, perhaps I can factor (k A^2)/(4 m² c^4) out:

= (k A^2)/(4 m² c^4) [4 m c² + k A^2 ].

So,

v_max^2 = c² * [ (k A^2)/(4 m² c^4) (4 m c² + k A^2) ) ] / [ (4 m² c^4 + 4 m c² k A^2 + k² A^4 )/(4 m² c^4) ) ].

Wait, because the denominator is [ (2 m c² + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) ]^2 = ( (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 ) / (4 m² c^4).

So,

v_max^2 = c² * [ (k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2 )) ) / (4 m² c^4) ) ] / [ (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 / (4 m² c^4) ) ].

The 4 m² c^4 denominators cancel out.

So,

= c² [ k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c² + k A^2)^2 ].

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should make a substitution. Let me let B = k A^2.

Then,

v_max^2 = c^2 [ (B) (4 m c^2 + B) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + B )^2 ].

Wait, let me expand the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: B (4 m c^2 + B ) = 4 m c^2 B + B^2.

Denominator: (2 m c^2 + B)^2 = 4 m² c^4 +4 m c^2 B + B^2.

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 (4 m c^2 B + B^2) / (4 m² c^4 +4 m c^2 B + B^2).

Hmm, perhaps I can factor the denominator.

Denominator: (2 m c^2 + B)^2.

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * B (4 m c^2 + B ) / (2 m c^2 + B )^2.

Wait, but 4 m c^2 = 2*(2 m c^2), so maybe 4 m c^2 + B = 2*(2 m c^2) + B.

Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the numerator as B ( (2 m c^2 ) * 2 + B ), which is B ( 2 (2 m c^2) + B ).

Hmm, perhaps I can factor out terms.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the entire fraction as:

[ B (4 m c^2 + B ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + B )^2 ].

Which is [ B ( 2*(2 m c^2 ) + B ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + B )^2 ].

Wait, perhaps I can write this as [ B ( (2 m c^2 + B ) + 2 m c^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + B )^2.

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor it differently.

Wait, 4 m c^2 + B = (2 m c^2 + B) + 2 m c^2.

So,

B (4 m c^2 + B ) = B ( (2 m c^2 + B ) + 2 m c^2 ) = B (2 m c^2 + B ) + 2 m c^2 B.

So,

Numerator: B (2 m c^2 + B ) + 2 m c^2 B.

Denominator: (2 m c^2 + B )^2.

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 [ ( B (2 m c^2 + B ) + 2 m c^2 B ) ] / (2 m c^2 + B )^2.

This simplifies to:

c^2 [ B (2 m c^2 + B) + 2 m c^2 B ) ] / (2 m c^2 + B )^2.

Grouping terms:

= c^2 [ B (2 m c^2 + B ) (1) + 2 m c^2 B ) ] / denominator.

= c^2 [ B (2 m c^2 + B ) + 2 m c^2 B ) ] / (2 m c^2 + B )^2.

Hmm, perhaps factor B in the first term:

= c^2 [ B (2 m c^2 + B ) + 2 m c^2 B ) ] = c^2 [ (2 m c^2 + B ) [ B + (2 m c^2 B)/(2 m c^2 + B) ) ] ].

Wait, not sure. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Let me instead try to compute this fraction:

[ B (4 m c^2 + B ) ] / (2 m c^2 + B )^2.

Hmm.

Let me expand the denominator: (2 m c^2 + B )^2 = 4 m² c^4 + 4 m c^2 B + B^2.

The numerator: 4 m c^2 B + B².

So,

v_max² = c² (4 m c^2 B + B²) / (4 m² c^4 +4 m c^2 B + B²).

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: B (4 m c^2 + B).

Denominator: (2 m c^2 + B )^2.

So,

v_max² = c² * [ B (4 m c^2 + B) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + B )^2 ].

Hmm, perhaps I can write 4 m c^2 + B as 2*(2 m c^2) + B.

Alternatively, perhaps think of it as 4 m c^2 + B = (2 m c^2) * 2 + B.

Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out 2 m c^2 from the numerator and denominator.

Wait, another approach: perhaps express this fraction in terms of (2 m c^2 + B ) and see if that helps.

Wait, 4 m c^2 + B = 2 m c^2 + (2 m c^2 + B ).

Hmm, that might not help directly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the options.

Looking back at the options, option B is:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) )

Wait, that's sqrt(1 + [1/(denominator)^2 ] ), which seems a bit off, but let me compute.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an expression that can be written as 1 over sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = something.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the expression I have for v_max in another way.

Wait, from earlier:

v_max²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + beta)]^2, where beta = (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So,

v_max^2 = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + beta)^2 ].

But I can write this as:

v_max^2 = c² [ ( (1 + beta)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + beta)^2 ) ].

Which is,

v_max^2 = c² [ ( (1 + 2 beta + beta^2) - 1 ) / (1 + beta)^2 ) ].

Simplify numerator:

(2 beta + beta²) = beta (2 + beta).

Thus,

v_max^2 = c² ( beta (2 + beta) ) / (1 + beta)^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor beta (2 + beta) as beta (beta + 2) = beta ( (beta +1) +1 ) = beta (beta +1) + beta.

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can write this as beta (2 + beta) = beta ( (1 + beta) ) + beta.

Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (1 + beta)^2 = (1 + beta)(1 + beta).

So,

v_max² = c² [ beta (2 + beta) ] / [ (1 + beta)^2 ].

= c² [ beta (2 + beta) ] / (1 + beta)^2.

Hmm, but how does this compare to the options?

Let me look at option B:

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) )

Wait, the expression inside the square root is 1 + 1/(1 - x), where x is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Let me compute 1 + 1/(1 - x) = (1 -x +1 ) / (1 - x ) = (2 - x )/(1 - x ).

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2 - x )/(1 - x ) ), where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Hmm, but our expression for v_max^2 is:

v_max^2 = c² [ beta (2 + beta) ] / (1 + beta )^2,

where beta = x/(2), because beta = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) = x/2.

Wait, if x = (k A^2)/( m c^2 ), then beta = x/(2).

Wait, perhaps we can rewrite beta in terms of x.

Wait, beta = (k A²) / (2 m c² ) = x/(2).

So, substituting x into our expression:

v_max² = c² [ (x/2) (2 + x/2) ) ] / (1 + x/2 )².

Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (x/2)(2 + x/2) = (x/2)( (4 + x)/2 ) = x (4 + x) /4.

Denominator: (1 + x/2 )^2 = ( (2 + x)/2 )^2 = (2 + x)^2 /4.

So,

v_max² = c² * [ x (4 + x ) /4 ] / [ (2 +x )^2 /4 ].

The 4's cancel.

= c² [ x (4 + x ) ] / (2 + x )^2.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this matches any of the options.

Let me see option B again:

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) )

Which is:

sqrt( (2 - (k A²)/(2 m c²) )/( 1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2) ) )

Wait, perhaps I can write this as sqrt( (2 - x )/(1 - x ) ), where x is (k A² )/(2 m c² ), which is beta.

Wait, but from our expression, v_max^2 is c² * [ x (4 + x ) ] / (2 + x )^2.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, let's compute option B's square:

v_max^2 = c² ( (2 - x ) / (1 -x ) ), where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So, v_max² = c² (2 - x )/(1 -x ).

Hmm, in our case, v_max² is c² [ x (4 +x ) ]/(2 +x )^2.

Not matching.

Wait, what about option D?

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

Which is sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 +x )^2 ), where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Which would be sqrt( (1 +x )^2 -1 )/(1 +x )^2 ) = sqrt( (1 + 2x + x^2 -1 ) ) / (1 +x )^2 ) = sqrt( (2x + x²) ) / (1 +x )^2.

Wait, so v_max² would be [ 2x +x² ] / (1 +x )^2 * c².

Which is the same as our expression: v_max² = c² [ x (2 +x ) ] / (1 +x )^2.

Which matches our expression.

Wait, because x is (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ), which is beta in our case.

So,

v_max² = c² [ beta (2 + beta ) ] / (1 + beta )^2.

Which is the same as option D's expression squared.

So, option D's expression is v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 +x )^2 ] ), where x is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Which when squared, becomes v_max² = c² ( (1 +x )^2 - 1 ) / (1 +x )^2.

Which is c² ( 2x +x² ) / (1 +x )^2.

Which is exactly what we have. So option D is correct.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

Yes, that's correct.

So the answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \) and maximum amplitude \( A \), we start by considering the relativistic energy relationship. The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of its relativistic kinetic energy and potential energy. At maximum displacement (\( x = A \)), all energy is potential, given by \( E_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), all energy is kinetic, and the relativistic kinetic energy is expressed as:

\[
K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Equating the total energy to the kinetic energy at \( x = 0 \), we have:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma \), we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Since \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we substitute \( \gamma \) into this expression:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( \beta = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), so the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \beta.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + \beta)^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + \beta)^2}.
\]

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \beta)^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \beta = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we get:

\[
v_{\text{max}}^2 = c^2 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2} \right).
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches the form of **Option D**. The other options are inconsistent with the relativistic energy relationship or incorrectly manipulate the terms.

**Answer: D**
