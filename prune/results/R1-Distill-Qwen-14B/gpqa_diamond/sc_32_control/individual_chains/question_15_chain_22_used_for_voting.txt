Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I remember that transit method involves the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of that happening depends on the size of the planet and the star's size, but wait, I think it also depends on the orbital distance and the alignment.

The question says both planets have the same mass. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2 has period P, Planet_1 has P/3. Oh, right, orbital period relates to the size of the orbit. Using Kepler's third law, which says that the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed divided by the star's mass. So since Planet_1's period is shorter, its orbit is smaller. Because the star's mass for Planet_1 is twice that of Planet_2's star. Wait, let me think. Kepler's third law is (P²) = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. Since the planet's mass is much smaller, M is the star's mass. So for same a, higher M would mean shorter period. Right.

So, Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but Planet_1's period is three times shorter. So, let's find the ratio of their semi-major axes.

Let me write Kepler's third law as P² ∝ a³ / M. So P^2 = (4π² a³)/(G M). So for each planet, P1² = (4π² a1³)/(G M1), and P2² = (4π² a2³)/(G M2). 

Since M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = P2 / 3. So let's plug in:

(P2/3)^2 = (4π² a1³)/(G * 2 M2)
And P2^2 = (4π² a2³)/(G M2)

Let me take the ratio of the two equations. 

[(P2²/9)] / [P2²] = [ (a1³)/(2 M2) ] / [ (a2³)/M2 ) ]

So 1/9 = (a1³)/(2 M2) * (M2)/(a2³) ) 
=> 1/9 = a1³/(2 a2³) 
=> 2 a1³ = 9 a2³ 
=> a1³ = (9/2) a2³ 
=> a1 = a2 * (9/2)^(1/3)

Hmm, (9/2) is 4.5, cube root of that is about 1.65. So a1 is about 1.65 a2. Wait, that's weird. Because Planet_1 has a shorter period but is orbiting a more massive star, so a smaller orbit. Wait, no, wait. Did I get that right? Because a longer semi-major axis means a larger orbit. But according to the calculation, a1 is larger than a2? That can't be right because Planet_1 has a shorter period.

Wait, maybe I messed up the setup. Let me try again. Let's denote P1 = P2 /3, M1 = 2 M2.

So for Kepler's law, for P, (P1)^2 = (4π² a1³)/(G M1)
Similarly, (P2)^2 = (4π² a2³)/(G M2)

Divide the two equations: (P1^2)/(P2^2) = (a1^3 M2)/(a2^3 M1)

Substituting numbers: ( (P2/3)^2 ) / (P2^2) ) = (a1^3 M2 ) / (a2^3 * 2 M2 )

Left side: (1/9) P2² / P2² = 1/9.

Right side: (a1^3 * M2 ) / (a2^3 * 2 M2 ) = a1^3/(2 a2^3 )

So 1/9 = a1^3/(2 a2^3 )

=> a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 

=> a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3)

Hmm, 2/9 is about 0.222, cube root is around 0.6. So a1 is about 0.6 a2. So Planet_1 has a smaller orbit than Planet_2. That makes sense, since it has a shorter period and a more massive star. So a1 is smaller than a2.

Now, the probability of transit depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and the orbital distance. The formula for the probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by some factor involving the orbital distance. Wait, I think the transit probability is ((R_p)/(a (1 - e^2)))^2 but assuming circular orbits, e=0. So it's (R_p/(a))^2. Wait, no, that's the depth of the transit. The probability is actually the ratio of the area of the star as seen from Earth to the area of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, the probability is the area of the planet's disk over the area of the star? Or is it the solid angle?

Wait, no. The transit probability depends on the alignment. The probability is approximately (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a^2) ) but only if the planet's orbit is edge-on. Wait, no, the geometric probability is (R_p / a)^2 * (something else). Wait, I'm getting confused here.

Let me think again. The probability that a planet transits is given by the area of the star relative to the orbit. The formula for the transit probability is (R_star / a)^2. Wait, no, I think it's (R_star / a)^2 multiplied by some other factors. Alternatively, the transit probability is (R_p / a)^2? No, that's the depth. Hmm.

Wait, I think the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a)^2, but wait, no, that can't be right. Because when a planet is farther away, the probability of transit should decrease. So when a is larger, the probability is lower.

Wait, let me look it up in memory. The transit probability, P, is given by (R_star / a)^2 * (some factor). Oh wait, no, I think it's P ≈ (R_star / a)^2 * (something else). Hmm, no.

Wait, another approach. The transit happens when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with the observer's line of sight. The probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the distance of the planet's orbit. The higher the ratio (R*/a), the higher the probability because the planet's path is more likely to cross our line of sight.

So the probability is proportional to (R*/a)^2. Because the area of the star is π(R*)², and the area of the planet's orbital disk (as seen edge-on) is π a². So the probability is roughly (R*/a)^2. But wait, I think more accurately, it's (R*/a)^2 multiplied by some other factors, but assuming edge-on and circular orbits, the probability is proportional to (R*/a)^2.

So for each planet, compute (R_star / a)^2. But wait, in the question, both host stars have the same radius. So R_1 = R_2. So the probability is proportional to (1/a)^2.

So the planet with smaller a will have a higher probability of transiting. Because (1/a)^2 is larger when a is smaller.

So in our case, a1 is about 0.6 a2, so a1 is smaller. So (1/a1)^2 = (1/(0.6 a2))^2 = (1/(0.6))² * (1/a2)^2 = (2.777...) * (1/a2)^2. So the transit probability for Planet_1 is about 2.777 times higher than that of Planet_2.

Wait, but wait. Because both stars have the same radius. So, the transit probability for each planet is proportional to (R_star / a)^2. Since R is same, it's (1/a)^2.

So, a1 is smaller, so (1/a1)^2 is larger. So Planet_1 has higher probability.

Wait, but according to the calculation above, a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6 a2. So (1/a1)^2 = (1/(0.6 a2))^2 ≈ (1/(0.6))² * (1/a2)^2 = (2.77..) * (1/a2)^2.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is about 2.77 times higher than Planet_2? So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1 because it has a higher probability.

Wait, looking at the options, let's see:

Options C and D suggest Planet_1 is preferred. C says ~1.65 times, D says ~2.7 times.

Wait, let me recalculate a1.

We had:

a1³ = (2/9) a2³

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3)

Calculating (2/9)^(1/3). 2/9 is about 0.2222. The cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.6. Let me compute 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So a1 is about 0.6 a2.

So (a1/a2) is 0.6. So (a2/a1) is 1.666... So (1/a1)^2 is (1/(0.6 a2))^2 = (1/(0.6))² * (1/a2)^2 = (2.777) * (1/a2)^2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is approximately 2.777 times higher than Planet_2. So which option is that?

Looking at the options:

A) Planet_2 is preferred, 2.25 times higher.

B) Planet_2, 1.5 times.

C) Planet_1, ~1.65.

D) Planet_1, ~2.7 times.

So option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to 2.7 times higher probability. So that would be the correct answer.

But wait, let me get the exact numbers without approximations.

We had:

a1³ = (2/9) a2³ → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3)

So (a2 / a1) = (9/(2))^(1/3) → (9/2) = 4.5 → cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.65.

So a2 = 1.65 a1.

Thus, (1/a1) = (1/(a2 /1.65 )) → 1.65 / a2.

Wait, no, (a2 / a1) is 1.65, so a1 = a2 / 1.65.

So (1/a1)^2 = (1/(a2/1.65 ))^2 = (1.65 / a2 )^2 = (1.65)^2 * (1/a2)^2.

1.65 squared is approximately 2.7225. So (1/a1)^2 is 2.7225 * (1/a2)^2.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is about 2.72 times higher, which is about 2.7 times. So option D.

So the correct answer should be D.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability is proportional to \((R_{\text{star}} / a)^2\), where \(R_{\text{star}}\) is the radius of the host star and \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\(R_1 = R_2\)), the probability depends on the inverse square of the semi-major axis (\(1/a^2\)).

### Step 1: Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis Relationship
Using Kepler's Third Law, \(P^2 \propto a^3 / M\), where \(P\) is the orbital period and \(M\) is the mass of the host star. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- \(P_1 = P_2 / 3\) (Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period).
- \(M_1 = 2M_2\) (Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's host star).

Substituting these values into the relationship:
\[
\frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / M_1}{a_2^3 / M_2}
\]
\[
\frac{(P_2 / 3)^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / (2M_2)}{a_2^3 / M_2}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{2a_2^3}
\]
\[
a_1^3 = \frac{2}{9}a_2^3
\]
\[
a_1 = a_2 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Approximating \(\left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6\), we find:
\[
a_1 \approx 0.6a_2
\]

### Step 2: Transit Probability Comparison
The transit probability is proportional to \((1/a)^2\). Since \(a_1 \approx 0.6a_2\), the ratio of the transit probabilities is:
\[
\frac{\text{Probability}_1}{\text{Probability}_2} = \frac{(1/a_1)^2}{(1/a_2)^2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{0.6}\right)^2 \approx 2.78
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability than Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Options
- **A)** Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred; Planet_1 has a higher probability.
- **B)** Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the probability difference is not 1.5 times.
- **C)** Incorrect. Planet_1 is preferred, but the probability difference is not 1.65 times.
- **D)** Correct. Planet_1 is preferred, and the probability difference is approximately 2.7 times.

### Final Answer
The researchers should prefer observing Planet_1 due to its ~2.7 times higher probability of transiting.
