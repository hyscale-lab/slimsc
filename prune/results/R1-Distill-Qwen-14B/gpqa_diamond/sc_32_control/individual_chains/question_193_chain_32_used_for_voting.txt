Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about how the number of stars changes with distance. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power, so 1/plx^5. They're asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So, plx = 1/distance, which means distance d = 1/plx.

Wait, right. So if parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance, then plx is proportional to 1/d. So plx = k/d, where k is some constant. But I might not need the constant right now.

The question says number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that as N ∝ 1/plx^5. But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, plx = 1/d → 1/plx = d. So 1/(plx)^5 is (d)^5. Because (1/(1/d))^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the number of stars as a function of distance. So if N ∝ d^5, then for each unit increase in d (distance r), the number of stars increases as r^5. But wait, let me think again about how the number of stars per unit volume or per some range relates.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of volume. The number of stars in a region could depend on the volume. But stars are spread out, so if you have a certain density, then the number would be proportional to volume. But that might not directly apply here because the question says the number varies with parallax in a specific way, so perhaps the density is considered uniform in that region.

Wait, but the number of stars is given as varying with parallax as 1/plx^5. So let's think step by step.

First, express parallax in terms of distance. So plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx.

So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Substituting plx in terms of d:

N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5 = d^5.

Wait, wait, no. Because 1/(plx)^5 is the same as (d)^5, since plx is 1/d.

So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. So perhaps it's the differential, the rate of change of N with respect to d. Because the options are in terms of r, which I think is the distance.

Wait, the question says "per unit range of distance, r". Hmm, phrasing is a bit ambiguous. Let me parse it.

The question is: How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?

Ah, so per unit of r, which is the distance. So they're looking for dN/dr, maybe.

Because if N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr is 5 d^4. So N would change with rate proportional to d^4.

Wait, but let me think again. So N = k * d^5, where k is the constant of proportionality.

If that's the case, then the derivative dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the number of stars increases as d^5, but the rate of change is proportional to d^4.

But wait, the question isn't clear whether it's asking for N as a function of r or the rate of change. Let me read the question again.

The question says, "How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?"

Hmm, "change with distance" typically refers to the rate of change, which would be dN/dr. So if N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr is proportional to d^4.

Looking at the options:

A) ~ r^3

B) ~ r^5

C) ~ r^4

D) ~ r^2

So if the rate is proportional to r^4, the answer would be C.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not confusing something else.

Wait, the initial statement is "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N = const * (1/plx)^5.

Since plx = 1/d, 1/plx = d, so N = const * d^5.

So N is proportional to d^5. So if we take the derivative, dN/dr = 5 const * d^4. So the change in number per unit distance is proportional to d^4.

But wait, another approach: if you have a certain number of stars per unit parallax, and parallax is inversely proportional to distance, then you can model it as a function of distance.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the number of stars within a certain range of distance.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5.

Since plx ∝ 1/d, 1/plx ∝ d. So 1/(plx)^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Therefore, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance. But the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So that's the derivative. So dN/dr = 5 d^4, which is proportional to r^4.

So the correct answer is option C, which is ~ r^4.

The question states that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), we have \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this into the given relationship, \( N \propto \frac{1}{(\frac{1}{d})^5} = d^5 \). Thus, the number of stars is proportional to \( d^5 \).

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance "per unit range of distance, \( r \)." This implies the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( d \), which is the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dd} \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto d^5 \), we find \( \frac{dN}{dd} \propto 5d^4 \). Therefore, the rate of change of the number of stars with distance is proportional to \( d^4 \), or \( r^4 \).

Among the options provided:
- **A)** \( \sim r^3 \): Incorrect, as the rate of change is proportional to \( r^4 \), not \( r^3 \).
- **B)** \( \sim r^5 \): Incorrect, as \( N \propto r^5 \), but the question asks for the rate of change, not \( N \) itself.
- **C)** \( \sim r^4 \): Correct, as the rate of change \( \frac{dN}{dd} \propto r^4 \).
- **D)** \( \sim r^2 \): Incorrect, as the relationship does not involve \( r^2 \).

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as the number of stars changes with distance at a rate proportional to \( r^4 \).
