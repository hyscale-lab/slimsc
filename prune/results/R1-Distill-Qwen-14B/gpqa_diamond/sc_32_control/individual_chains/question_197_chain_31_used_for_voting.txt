Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The question is about identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different compounds, all of which seem to be substituted benzene derivatives with some substituents.

First, I need to figure out what Compound X is from the given spectral data. Then, I can determine what reaction it undergoes with red phosphorus and HI. That should lead me to the correct product.

Starting with the IR data: the peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, likely indicating O-H or N-H stretching. But since there's a peak around 1720 cm-1, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions might be from aromatic C=C stretching. So putting that together, the compound probably has a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. Wait, the 3400-2500 suggests an O-H, but carboxylic acids have broad O-H around 2500-3000 as well. Hmm.

Wait, the 1720 is more indicative of an ester or a ketone. Carboxylic acids usually have a carbonyl around 1700, but their O-H is broader and around 2500-3300, but also could be a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an anhydride or something else. But let's look at the NMR.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Aromatic protons usually are around 7-8 ppm. If it's at 10.5, that's likely an -OH proton, like from a carboxylic acid. Because in a carboxylic acid, the -OH is broad and around 10-12 ppm. Alternatively, could it be an aldehyde proton? Aldehydes are around 9-10, but that's a triplet usually, but this is a singlet. Or maybe an amide? But amide protons are usually deshielded but not that high. So carboxylic acid OH makes sense here.

Wait, but earlier the IR had 1720, which for a carboxylic acid might be a bit high. Wait, carboxylic acids typically have C=O around 1700-1725 cm-1, so 1720 is possible. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or ketone, but let's hold on that thought.

At 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): This looks like two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like in benzene derivatives with substituents in the para positions. So maybe two substituents on the benzene ring, opposite each other.

Looking at the pattern: 8.0 (d) and 7.2 (d). The coupling between aromatic protons in para-substituted rings can lead to such a pattern. For example, in a para-disubstituted benzene, if the substituents are electron-withdrawing, the protons would be deshielded. Alternatively, if there are substituents like methyl groups, which are electron-donating, the ring protons would be more shielded. Wait, but the substituents can influence the chemical shifts of the adjacent protons.

Wait, let me think. A benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. Let's say, for example, substituents at positions 1 and 3 (but wait, para is 1 and 4). Wait, in para substitution, substituents are opposite each other. So, substituents at positions 1 and 4.

So, the upfield shift (7.2 ppm) is a doublet. Maybe the substituents are such that the adjacent protons are more shielded. For example, if the substituent is electron-withdrawing, the ortho protons would be deshielded (higher ppm), but para would have different behavior. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an electron-donating group, making the ortho protons more shielded, leading to lower ppm.

Wait, in para-substituted benzene with two electron-withdrawing groups, the ortho protons would be deshielded (downfield). But in this case, the doublets are at 8.0 and 7.2. So maybe the substituents are in positions 1 and 4, with another substituent attached elsewhere.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, after the aromatic protons, there's a multiplet at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), and then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). These suggest some alkyl chain.

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is likely a methyl group attached to a CH2 (since the triplet would be from coupling with two neighboring protons). So, maybe a (CH2CH2CH3) group, like a butyl chain. Let's think: the 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a CH(CH3) group, and the 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) could be a CH group adjacent to another CH2.

Wait, putting this together, the alkyl group seems to be something like CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3, but let's see.

Wait, looking at the integration: 2.9 ppm is 1H, 1.7 ppm is 2H, 1.4 is 3H, 0.9 is 3H. So starting from the 0.9 (t, 3H), that's a CH2CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 (d,3H) would be a CH(CH3) group. Then the 1.7 (m,2H) would be a CH2 adjacent to both the CH(CH3) and another CH. The 2.9 (m,1H) is the CH adjacent to both.

So putting this together: the structure is probably a CH2 group connected to a CH(CH3), which is connected to another CH2, which is connected to a CH2CH3. Wait, but wait, that might be a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, perhaps a different arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group. Let me think: a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait: sec-butyl is -CH2-C(CH3)H-CH2- but that's not correct. Wait, no: a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, no, wait, no, wait: butyl groups.

Wait, butyl is four carbons. A primary butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3. A secondary butyl would have the branching on the second carbon. So, for a sec-butyl group, it's -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait, no, a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-, but that's three carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyl group is an isobutyl group. Isobutyl is -CH2-CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, isobutyl is -CH2-CH(CH3)2? No, that's a neopentyl group perhaps. Wait, perhaps it's a tert-butyl group, but that would have a singlet for the nine hydrogens.

Wait, let's think about the integrations. The 0.9 ppm is a triplet (3H), which suggests it's connected to a CH2. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), suggesting a CH(CH3) group. So the structure would be CH2-CH(CH3)-something.

So maybe the structure is something like CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3, but that's a pentyl group. Wait, no, perhaps it's a branching point.

Wait, let me draw it:

The 0.9 triplet (3H) is likely a CH2CH2CH3. The 1.4 doublet (3H) would be a CH(CH3). Then the 1.7 multiplet (2H) is a CH2 adjacent to both the CH(CH3) and another CH. The 2.9 ppm (1H) is a CH connected to another CH2.

Wait, perhaps it's like this: the structure is a CH2 connected to a CH(CH3), which is connected to a CH2, which is connected to a CH2CH3. So the chain would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3. But wait, that's a pentyl group, but perhaps the branching is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyl group is a sec-butyl group. The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the benzene. Wait, but that's not quite right. Alternatively, the structure is a CH2CH2CH(CH3) group.

Wait, maybe the chain is a isopropyl group attached to a CH2. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group with a methyl branch.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, that's a butyl group again.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyl group is an isobutyl group. Let me think again. The isobutyl group is -(CH2)2CH(CH3). Wait, no, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2. No, that's not right. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think about the NMR signals.

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) would be the end of a chain, so it's a CH2CH2CH3. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) would be a CH(CH3) group. So the structure from that end would be CH2CH2CH3 connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH(CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3. But that's a pentyl group, which may not fit. Alternatively, it's a butyl group with branching. So perhaps the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, that would be a sec-butyl group.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. No, that's not right. Wait, no. A secondary butyl group would have the structure -CH2CH(CH2CH3), but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a tert-butyl group, but the NMR doesn't show a singlet for 9H, so that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps it's a methylene group attached to a CH(CH3), which is attached to another methylene.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3?

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl group with a branching at the second carbon. Let's see: the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is a CH2 group between two CH groups. So perhaps the structure is:

-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3.

Wait, but that's a butyl group. Let me think about the integration again.

The 0.9 (t, 3H): that's the terminal methyl of a -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 group. But in this case, perhaps it's part of a larger structure. Alternatively, maybe the alkyl chain is a pentyl group, but that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps the alkyl group is a propyl chain with a methyl branch. So, for example, something like -(CH2)2CH(CH3). That would mean a 2-methylpropyl group, which is an isobutyl group. Hmm.

Wait, the isobutyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-? No, wait, no. The isobutyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. Oh wait, no. Isobutyl is -CH2-CH(CH3)2. No, that's not correct. Let me think again. The structure of isobutyl is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-. No, wait, no. Let me get this correct.

The correct structure of an isobutyl group is -(CH2)2CH(CH3). Wait, no. Wait, no, the isobutyl group is actually -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, I think I'm mixing up the substituents.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's consider the possible structures of the alkyl group in the NMR.

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a CH(CH3) group. So, if I have a CH2 connected to a CH(CH3), and that CH is connected to another CH2, which is connected to another CH2CH3.

So, the structure would be:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3

Wait, but that would be a pentyl group, but perhaps that's not fitting. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-

But then where is the rest? Hmm, perhaps it's a three-carbon chain with a methyl branch.

Wait, another approach: looking at the splitting patterns.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a triplet or a more complex multiplet, but perhaps it's a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to a CH.

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is a CH2 group adjacent to a CH and another CH2.

The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH(CH3), which is adjacent to a CH2.

The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is the terminal CH3 of a CH2CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3

Wait, but the integrations are 3H, 2H, 3H, and 3H. So perhaps the groups are: a CH2CH2CH3 (3H at 0.9), then a CH2 (2H at 1.7), then a CH (1H at 2.9), then a CH(CH3) (3H at 1.4). Hmm, that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3.

But that's five carbons, but the NMR shows only 3H, 2H, 3H, 3H. So maybe it's a four-carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps it's a 3-pentyl group or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a CH2CH(CH3)2 group, but that would give a triplet for the CH(CH3)2, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the chain is a three-carbon group with a methyl branch. Let me think about the structure:

The group is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So that's a four-carbon group, with the CH(CH3) in the middle. So the structure would be:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3: that's 2-methylpropyl, which is an isobutyl group. Wait, no, isobutyl is actually -(CH2)CH(CH3)2, isn't it? No, isobutyl is -CH2-CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a isobutyl group attached to the benzene ring. So the benzene has a substituent at one position, and then the isobutyl group.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting stuck on the alkyl group. Let's think about the aromatic part again. The NMR shows 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene, with two substituents in the para positions. But wait, in para substitution, each substituent is at opposite positions, so perhaps the benzene has two substituents, each in the para position.

Wait, but the question is about the reaction of Compound X with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of nitro groups to amines, but wait, that's when you have a nitro group (NO2) in the compound. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI can be used to effect the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, but that's under specific conditions.

Wait, but more commonly, red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines. Or wait, no, perhaps it's the hydrolysis of alkyl halides. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of the Clemmensen reduction, but that uses Zn-Hg and HCl, not red phosphorus. Alternatively, I might be mixing up reactions.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI are used in the preparation of alkenes from alcohols via the elimination reaction. Wait, no, that's the use of H2SO4 or other acids. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of the hydrolysis of an ester.

Wait, but let's think about the possible reaction. Compound X has a carbonyl group, as indicated by the IR at 1720 cm-1. So perhaps it's an ester or a ketone. But wait, the presence of an O-H in the IR (3400-2500) suggests that maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But the NMR has a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which would fit a carboxylic acid's -OH proton.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis under acidic conditions to form a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but red phosphorus is involved in some other reactions. Let me think. Red phosphorus and HI can be used in the hydrolysis of nitriles. Wait, nitriles (R-C≡N) can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids using HI and red phosphorus. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but let me think about how that would proceed. For example, if Compound X is an ester, say R-O-CO-Ar, where Ar is an aromatic ring, then hydrolysis under acidic conditions (like HI and red phosphorus) would give R-OH and the acid Ar-COOH. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics.

Alternatively, perhaps Compound X is an acyl chloride, but the IR would show a higher wavenumber for the carbonyl, around 1800 or so, which it doesn't. So more likely, it's an ester or a ketone.

Wait, but the presence of a broad peak around 10.5 ppm in the NMR suggests an -OH group, which would make sense for a carboxylic acid. So perhaps Compound X is a carboxylic acid. But then, the IR would have a C=O at around 1700, which is what we have here (1720 cm-1). So that fits.

If Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might not make sense. Wait, but alternatively, perhaps Compound X is an ester, and the reaction is acid-catalyzed hydrolysis to form the carboxylic acid.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options provided.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So, the possible products are either substituted benzene rings with an alkyl group (options B and D) or substituted benzene rings with a carboxylic acid (options A and C).

Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Let me think about what that reaction typically does.

Red phosphorus and HI is often used to effect the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. For example, R-CN + HI (H+/I-) and red phosphorus would produce R-COOH. Alternatively, it's used for the hydrolysis of esters, but under acidic conditions, esters typically hydrolyze to carboxylic acids.

Alternatively, if the starting compound is an ester, R-O-CO-Ar, then hydrolysis would give R-OH and Ar-COOH.

Wait, but then looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would imply that the starting compound might have been an ester, say, the sec-butyl ester of benzoic acid, which upon hydrolysis would give benzoic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is a nitrile adjacent to the benzene ring, and the hydrolysis gives a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but let's think about the structure of Compound X based on the NMR and IR data.

The IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl group, probably an ester or a ketone or a carboxylic acid. The NMR has a broad peak at 10.5 ppm (1H), which is consistent with a carboxylic acid's -OH. But then, the IR for a carboxylic acid would have a strong O-H stretch around 2500-3300, which is present (3400–2500 cm-1). So perhaps Compound X is a carboxylic acid.

But then, why is there a peak at 1720? For a carboxylic acid, the C=O is usually around 1700 cm-1, so 1720 is a bit high, but possible.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester. The C=O in an ester is around 1720-1760 cm-1, which fits the IR data. Then, the O-H in the IR would be from something else, perhaps an alcohol or another -OH group. But the NMR shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps Compound X is a phenyl ester. For example, benzyl acetate would have a carbonyl around 1720, but the NMR would show a singlet for the ester oxygen's adjacent CH3. But in this case, the NMR doesn't show a singlet for CH3 near 4 ppm, which would be the case for benzyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a substituted benzoic acid with an alkyl chain.

Wait, looking at the NMR again. The aromatic protons are at 8.0 (d,2H) and 7.2 (d,2H), suggesting a para-substituted benzene. So, the benzene has two substituents in para positions.

Wait, but if it's a benzoic acid, then perhaps one substituent is the COOH group, and another substituent is an alkyl group. Let me think: for example, 4-ethylbenzoic acid.

But let's look at the NMR. The aromatic protons in para-substituted benzoic acid would typically have two doublets. For example, in para-substituted benzoic acid, the two protons ortho to the COOH group would be deshielded and appear around 8 ppm, and the para proton would be at lower ppm. Wait, but in 4-ethylbenzoic acid, the substituents are COOH at position 1 and ethyl at position 4.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be ortho to the substituents. The COOH is at position 1 (assuming numbering starts from the COOH), so the ortho protons would be at positions 2 and 6. Since the substituents are in the para positions, the other substituent is at position 4.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused about the substituent positions. Let me think: in a para-substituted benzene, substituents are at positions 1 and 3? No, wait, para is 1 and 4. So if the substituents are at 1 and 4, then the structure would have two substituents opposite each other.

So, for example, if substituent A is at position 1 and substituent B is at position 4, the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. The protons in positions 2 and 6 are ortho to substituent A, and protons 3 and 5 are meta to substituent A and ortho to substituent B.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are two doublets integrating to 2H each. That suggests that the ring has two substituents in such a way that each pair of protons is a doublet, and each is equivalent.

So, for a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions 1 and 2, but that would lead to different splitting.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are at positions 1 and 4 (para), each being an electron-withdrawing group. Then, the ortho protons (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded, leading to higher ppm (like 8.0 ppm), and the para protons (positions 3 and 5) would be more shielded, leading to lower ppm (like 7.2 ppm). That seems to fit the NMR data.

So, the substituents are at positions 1 and 4. Let's say substituent X is at position 1 and substituent Y at position 4.

Substituent X could be a COOH group, which would be at position 1. Then substituent Y would be an alkyl group at position 4.

In that case, the aromatic protons ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded, giving higher ppm (8.0 ppm), and the protons meta to substituent Y (positions 3 and 5) would be more shielded, giving lower ppm (7.2 ppm). That fits.

So, the structure would be 4-alkylbenzoic acid, with the alkyl group at position 4.

Looking at the alkyl group in the NMR, it seems to have a branching, as we discussed earlier. The 0.9 triplet suggests a terminal methyl, so maybe a butyl group. Let's see the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would fit if the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached at position 4.

So, if Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, but wait. The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. So what reaction would that be?

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is a carboxylic acid, what would happen when it reacts with HI and red phosphorus?

But wait, red phosphorus and HI are usually for nitrile hydrolysis. If X is an acid, perhaps the reaction doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester.

Wait, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to produce the acid.

So, if X is an ester, say, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate ester, then upon hydrolysis with HI and red phosphorus, it would form 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile adjacent to the benzene ring, and the hydrolysis gives the carboxylic acid.

But in that case, the structure would be different.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the NMR data for the possibility that X is an ester.

If X is an ester, the IR would show a carbonyl at around 1720 cm-1, which fits. The NMR would show the ester oxygen's adjacent CH3 as a singlet around 4 ppm, but in the given data, there's no such peak. Instead, the peaks are at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm, which suggests a more complex alkyl chain, possibly with branching.

So, maybe the structure is a butyl group attached to the benzene ring, and the ester oxygen is connected to another group. But without a singlet for an OCH3 or OCH2CH3, that's less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a secondary alcohol, but with a carbonyl group elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a ketone. The IR would support that with a strong C=O around 1720 cm-1. The NMR would then show a singlet for the aromatic protons, but in this case, they are split into two doublets. Hmm, but the presence of an O-H in the IR suggests otherwise.

Wait, but the O-H in the IR could be from an alcohol. If X is a ketone with an adjacent alcohol group, but that seems less likely. Alternatively, perhaps X is a hemiacetal or some other structure, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde derivative but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a phenyl ester, but without the expected OCH2CH3 or similar in the NMR, that's less likely.

Hmm, perhaps I need to look at the options again.

If the reaction of X with red phosphorus and HI gives one of the options, which product would that be.

Assuming that X is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That's a carboxylic acid, which would be the product of hydrolysis of its corresponding ester.

So if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate ester, then the reaction would produce benzoic acid. So, the product would be option C.

But wait, the question says X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. So what's the reaction here.

Red phosphorus and HI are usually used for the hydrolysis of nitriles. For example, R-CN + HI (H+ and I-) in presence of red phosphorus gives R-COOH.

So, if X is a nitrile, say 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile, then the reaction would give 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

But then, the IR and NMR data of X would be of a nitrile.

But wait, the IR of X shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which would be more consistent with an ester (nitriles have C≡N around 2200 cm-1). So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if X is an amide, but the IR for amide carbonyl is around 1650-1700 cm-1, which fits the 1720? Not exactly, but maybe.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back.

The initial analysis suggests that X has a carboxylic acid group (NMR at 10.5 ppm), a para-substituted benzene ring (NMR at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm), and an alkyl chain with a butyl group (NMR signals at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, 0.9 ppm).

So, X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

But then the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. What would that do?

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a nitrile, and the reaction converts it into a carboxylic acid. But the IR and NMR data don't support that. The IR would have a nitrile peak around 2200 cm-1, which isn't present.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. When red phosphorus and HI are used, perhaps it's for the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. So, if X is an ester, then the reaction would form the acid.

But how would the NMR of X look as an ester?

If X is an ester with a structure like R-O-CO-Ar, the NMR would show the ester oxygen adjacent to R, but in the data provided, the alkyl chain is more complex, with multiple CH groups, which suggests either a branched chain or a secondary alcohol.

Wait, perhaps X is an ester with a tertiary alcohol, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a ketone, but then the O-H in the IR wouldn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H in the IR is from an alcohol, and the compound is a secondary alcohol with a carbonyl group, but that seems less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from a phenol group. Wait, but phenol's O-H is around 5-6 ppm in the NMR, but in this case, it's at 10.5 ppm, which is more like a carboxylic acid.

So, perhaps X is a carboxylic acid, and the reaction is something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a carbonyl group. Red phosphorus and HI can be used in the reduction of carbonyl groups to aldehydes or ketones, but that's done under specific conditions.

Wait, but without knowing the exact reaction, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If X is this compound, and the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen?

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because the product would already be the acid, and the reaction would require X to be something else.

Alternatively, if X is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to form the acid, which is option C.

But then, the NMR of X would have a different structure. Let's see, for example, if X is ethyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, the NMR would show a singlet around 4 ppm for the OCH2CH3 group, but in our given data, that's not present. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an acid chloride, but the IR would have a higher carbonyl peak, around 1800 cm-1, which it doesn't.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach.

The reaction of X with red phosphorus and HI is likely a hydrolysis reaction. If X is an ester, the product would be a carboxylic acid. If X is an nitrile, the product would be a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, options A and C are carboxylic acids. So perhaps X is a nitrile, and the reaction produces a carboxylic acid.

But the IR of X doesn't show a nitrile peak (around 2200 cm-1), so that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps X is an acyl chloride. But the IR would show a higher wavenumber, around 1800 cm-1, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester with a branching in the alkyl group.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester to an acid, and the product is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, if X is the ester, then the product is the acid.

But then, the NMR of X would need to show the ester group, which it doesn't. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of a group, such as the formation of an alkene from an alcohol.

Wait, but the product options don't show any alkenes.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of an ester's OR group with another group, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of an acyl chloride to a carboxylic acid, but again, the IR doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an acid anhydride, but the IR would have a peak around 1800 cm-1, which isn't present.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the possible structure of X.

The NMR shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which is likely a carboxylic acid's -OH. The aromatic protons are in a para-substituted benzene. The alkyl chain has a butyl group with a methyl branch, as seen from the NMR signals.

So, X is likely 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Then, what reaction would X undergo with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, but if X is already a carboxylic acid, what reaction would occur? Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for reactions where they add iodide ions, perhaps for substitution or elimination.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is the iodination of the compound. For example, if X has a good leaving group, like a tosylate, HI could substitute it with iodide. But in this case, X is a benzoic acid with a butyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the deprotonation of the -OH to form a carboxylate, but I don't see how that would change the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the benzoic acid into an acid chloride, but that's done with SOCl2 or similar reagents, not red phosphorus and HI.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If X is this, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might not change it. But that can't be the case, as the question implies that a reaction occurs.

Wait, perhaps X is a nitrile attached to the benzene ring, and the reaction produces the carboxylic acid. But the IR doesn't show a nitrile peak.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a phenol ester, and the reaction converts it into a benzoic acid.

Wait, but that's not matching the data.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a secondary alcohol with a ketone group, but I don't see how that fits.

Wait, perhaps X is a ketone and an alcohol, but that's not making sense. Alternatively, perhaps X is a hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the oxidation of a benzylic position. But I'm not sure how that fits.

Wait, another approach: perhaps X is a secondary alcohol, and the reaction is the substitution to form an iodide.

But if X is a secondary alcohol, then the IR wouldn't show a strong peak at 1720 cm-1. So that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a tertiary alcohol, but again, the IR doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of the possible structures again.

The NMR data suggests a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions, one of which is a carboxylic acid group (based on the singlet at 10.5 ppm and the IR), and the other substituent is an alkyl group with a butyl chain.

So the structure would be 4-alkylbenzoic acid.

The alkyl group is a butyl group with a methyl branch, as per the NMR. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the ring.

So, the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

But then, what reaction does this undergo with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe the reaction isn't hydrolysis but something else.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the production of alkenes through the elimination of HX from alcohols. For example, if you have a secondary or tertiary alcohol, it can be treated with HI and red phosphorus to form an alkene via the elimination reaction.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which has a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the ring, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of HI from a neighboring position.

Wait, but 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is an acid. How would that react?

Alternatively, perhaps X is a different compound, and the product is one of the options.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzyl alcohol derivative, and the reaction forms an alkene.

Looking at option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That would be a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in para positions.

So, if the reaction is the elimination of HX from a benzylic alcohol, perhaps X is a benzyl alcohol with a substituent, and upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus, it forms an alkene.

Wait, but in that case, X would need a benzylic hydrogen, which isn't clear from the data.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a bromide or iodide attached to a benzene ring, and the reaction is a substitution.

Wait, perhaps X is an aryl bromide, and the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires activating groups, which aren't clear here.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl iodide, and the reaction is some elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a tertiary alcohol, which upon treatment with HI and red phosphorus, undergoes elimination to form an alkene.

But I'm not seeing the direct connection.

Given that I'm a bit stuck, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the data.

The NMR and IR data suggest that X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is likely leading to the formation of an acid, but if X is already an acid, perhaps the reaction is not changing it. That suggests that perhaps X is not the acid but another compound that converts into the acid.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to form the acid.

In that case, the product would be option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, the answer would be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the spectral data provided for Compound X.

### IR Analysis:
- The broad peak in the range **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** indicates a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid or an ester.

### ¹H NMR Analysis:
- The **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)** peak is characteristic of a carboxylic acid -OH proton.
- The **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.2 ppm (d, 2H)** peaks suggest a para-substituted benzene ring, with two substituents in the para positions.
- The **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**, **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**, **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**, and **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** peaks indicate a branched alkyl chain, likely a **sec-butyl group**.

### Proposed Structure of Compound X:
Based on the spectral data, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This structure consists of:
- A para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.
- The sec-butyl group is consistent with the NMR data, with the branching observed in the peaks at 2.9 ppm, 1.7 ppm, 1.4 ppm, and 0.9 ppm.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. However, since Compound X is already a carboxylic acid, the reaction does not alter its structure. Thus, the product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Conclusion:
The final product of the reaction is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, corresponding to **Option C**.

Answer: C
