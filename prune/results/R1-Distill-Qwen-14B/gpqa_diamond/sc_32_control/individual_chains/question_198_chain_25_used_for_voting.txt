Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about the stability of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes. I remember that the stability constant, beta, tells us how stable a complex is. A higher beta means the complex is more stable.

The problem gives me the concentration of Co²+ as 1e-2 M and SCN- as 0.1 M. The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, I'm a bit confused. I thought the stability constants usually increase with the number of ligands, but here β3 is higher than β2. Hmm, maybe the order isn't strictly about how many ligands are attached but the specific complexes.

So the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think are the Co(SCN)_n complexes. Wait, what's the dithiocyanato mean? Oh, right, dithiocyanato would probably be the Co with two SCN- ligands, so that's the [Co(SCN)_2]²+ complex.

I need to find the fraction of Co²+ that is in the form of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ among all possible Co species. The possible complexes are from n=0 to n=4 SCN- ligands, I think, so [Co], [CoSCN], [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3], [Co(SCN)_4].

The total concentration of Co is the sum of all these complexes. The approach I remember is to calculate the fraction of each complex based on their stability constants and the ligand concentration.

The formula for the fraction f_n is given by (β_n * [SCN^-]^n ) / (1 + Σ(β_m * [SCN^-]^m) for m=0 to 4 )

Wait, but wait, m is from 0 to 4. So each term in the denominator is β_m multiplied by [SCN]^m.

Let me write that down. The general formula for the fraction of the nth complex is:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / denominator,

where denominator = 1 + β_1 [SCN] + β_2 [SCN]^2 + β_3 [SCN]^3 + β_4 [SCN]^4.

Wait, but what about [SCN]^0? That's 1. So the denominator is the sum of each β_m multiplied by [SCN]^m, for m from 0 to 4.

Wait, no. Because for each complex, the term is β_m [SCN]^m. So the denominator is the sum of all these terms from m=0 to m=4.

So I need to compute each term β_m * (0.1)^m for m=0,1,2,3,4.

Let me compute each term:

m=0: β0 is 1 (since β0 is the stability constant for the complex with 0 ligands, which is just the free Co²+ ion). So 1 * (0.1)^0 = 1 *1 =1.

m=1: β1=9 * (0.1)^1 = 9 *0.1=0.9

m=2: β2=40 * (0.1)^2 =40 *0.01=0.4

m=3: β3=63 * (0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063

m=4: β4=16 * (0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016

Now, sum all these up for the denominator:

Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016

Let me calculate that:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3

2.3 +0.063=2.363

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646

So denominator is approximately 2.3646.

Now, the fraction f_2 is (β2 * [SCN]^2 ) / denominator.

Which is (40 * 0.1^2) / 2.3646.

Wait, wait, no. Because f_n is (β_n [SCN]^n) divided by denominator, which is the same as the sum.

So for n=2, it's (40 * 0.1^2) = 40 *0.01 =0.4. Then 0.4 / 2.3646.

Let me compute 0.4 / 2.3646.

Hmm, 2.3646 is about 2.3646.

0.4 divided by 2.3646.

Well, 2.3646 *0.169 ≈ 0.4 (since 2.3646 *0.17 = approx 0.402, which is close to 0.4).

So 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, or 16.9%.

Wait, but wait. The options are given, and option D is 16.9%.

So the percentage is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I make mistakes.

Wait, let me compute each term again.

m=0: 1 *1 =1.

m=1:9 *0.1=0.9.

m=2:40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

m=3:63*(0.001)=0.063.

m=4:16*(0.0001)=0.0016.

Sum is 1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646. Correct.

So denominator is 2.3646.

For n=2: 40*(0.1)^2 =0.4.

0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, which is 16.9%. So option D.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)\_2]²⁺) among all cobalt-containing species, we use the stability constants provided and the given concentrations of Co²⁺ and SCN⁻. The stability constant β_n represents the equilibrium constant for the formation of the [Co(SCN)\_n]²⁺ complex.

The fraction of the [Co(SCN)\_2]²⁺ complex is given by:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\text{Denominator}}
\]

where the denominator is the sum of all terms \(\beta_m [\text{SCN}^-]^m\) for \(m = 0\) to \(4\). The denominator is calculated as:

\[
\text{Denominator} = \sum_{m=0}^4 \beta_m [\text{SCN}^-]^m
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \(\beta_0 = 1\), \(\beta_1 = 9\), \(\beta_2 = 40\), \(\beta_3 = 63\), \(\beta_4 = 16\)
- \([\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M}\)

The terms are calculated as:
- \(m = 0\): \(\beta_0 [\text{SCN}^-]^0 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\)
- \(m = 1\): \(\beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9\)
- \(m = 2\): \(\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4\)
- \(m = 3\): \(\beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063\)
- \(m = 4\): \(\beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016\)

Summing these terms gives:
\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

The fraction of the [Co(SCN)\_2]²⁺ complex is:
\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

Converting this to a percentage:
\[
f_2 \times 100 \approx 16.9\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is approximately **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.
