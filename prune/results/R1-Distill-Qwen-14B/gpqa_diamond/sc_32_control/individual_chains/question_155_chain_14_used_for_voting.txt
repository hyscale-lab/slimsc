Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about uncertainty in the P_z operator. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, the setup. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The explicit state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which I think means that the state is already expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. Oh wait, wait. No, wait. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so the state is given in that basis. So that would mean that the components are in the eigenbasis of P_z. But the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. So I probably need to find the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared to compute the uncertainty.

The uncertainty formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). Right. So I need to calculate these two expectation values.

So the state is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Because it's a column vector, each component is the amplitude in the respective basis state.

But wait, let me make sure. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the basis states are |+z>, |0>, and |-z>, or something like that? Because P_z is a spin operator component, I think. So the eigenstates of P_z are |↑>, |0>, |↓> maybe, or something similar.

Wait, looking at the matrix for P_z:

P_z matrix is:
[ ħ, 0, 0;
0, 0, 0;
0, 0, -ħ ]

So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ. So the eigenvectors must be the standard basis vectors. Because for the first diagonal element, the eigenvector is [1,0,0], the second is [0,1,0], and the third is [0,0,1]. So the state is given in the eigenbasis of P_z. So the components of the state vector are the expansion coefficients in this basis.

So the state is |ψ> = (-1/2)|+z> + (1/√2)|0> + (-1/2)|-z>.

Wait, no. Because the basis is the eigenvectors of P_z, so |+z> is [1,0,0], |0> is [0,1,0], |-z> is [0,0,1]. So yes, the state is a combination of these.

But wait, the state is in the eigenstate of P_x. So to find the expectation values, I can directly compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ and ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩, since P_z is diagonal in this basis.

Wait, but wait, P_z is diagonal in this basis, so P_z squared is the same as P_z squared because it's diagonal. So computing ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ is straightforward.

Let me write down the state as a vector:

|ψ> = [ a, b, c ]^T = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

So a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2.

Now, compute ⟨P_z⟩:
⟨P_z⟩ = a*(ħ) + b*(0) + c*(-ħ) = (-1/2)ħ + 0 + (-1/2)(-ħ) = (-1/2ħ) + (1/2 ħ) = 0.

Wait, that's interesting. Because a is -1/2, so a*ħ is (-1/2)ħ. c is -1/2, so c*(-ħ) is (-1/2)*(-ħ) = (1/2)ħ. So sum is (-1/2 +1/2) ħ = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Now, ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just each diagonal element squared. So the diagonal elements of P_z are ħ, 0, -ħ. So their squares are ħ², 0, ħ². So P_z² is a diagonal matrix with elements [ ħ², 0, ħ² ].

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = a²*(ħ²) + b²*(0) + c²*(ħ²) = (a² + c²) ħ².

Compute a²: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. c²: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. So a² + c² = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. Therefore, ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/2) ħ².

So the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² ) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ² ) - 0 ) = sqrt(1/2 ħ² ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So the answer should be B.

But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, another way to compute ⟨P_z²⟩: since each basis state |+z> has P_z = ħ, so when squared, it's ħ². Similarly for |-z>, squared it's ħ². The middle state |0> has P_z=0, so squared is 0.

So the state is |ψ> = a|+z> + b|0> + c|−z⟩.

So when you compute ⟨P_z²⟩, it's |a|^2 * (ħ²) + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (ħ²) = (a² + c²) ħ².

Which in this case is (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = 1/2 ħ². So yes, correct.

And ⟨P_z⟩ is (a*ħ + c*(-ħ)) = ħ (a - c). Plugging in a = -1/2, c = -1/2.

a - c = (-1/2) - (-1/2) )= 0. So zero. So yes, the uncertainty is sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ), which is ħ / sqrt(2).

So the correct answer is option B.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as a column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The operator $P_z$ is diagonal in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, with diagonal elements $\hbar, 0, -\hbar$. Thus, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = (-\frac{1}{2})\hbar + (\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})(0) + (-\frac{1}{2})(-\hbar).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = -\frac{1}{2}\hbar + \frac{1}{2}\hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is also diagonal, with diagonal elements $\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = (-\frac{1}{2})^2\hbar^2 + (\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})^2(0) + (-\frac{1}{2})^2\hbar^2.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the uncertainty formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substitute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **option B**.
