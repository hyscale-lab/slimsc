Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about the area of a pseudosphere given a certain metric. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of dx and dy. Oh, but wait, pseudosphere usually refers to a surface in hyperbolic geometry, which is a two-dimensional space. So maybe this is the metric for a pseudosphere in two dimensions.

Wait, but I remember that the area of a pseudosphere (which is a surface of constant negative curvature) can be a bit tricky. The standard pseudosphere has finite volume in some sense, but I'm not exactly sure about the area.

Wait, no, in two dimensions, the area would be analogous to the area of a sphere in three dimensions. For a sphere of radius r, the area is 4πr². But for a pseudosphere, which is a hyperbolic space, I think the area is different because the curvature is negative.

Wait a second, the metric given here looks like it's conformally flat. Because it's written as (32)/(4 - x² - y²) times (dx² + dy²). So, this is similar to the form E²(dx² + dy²), where E is a function of x and y. So it's a conformal metric, which means we can use the standard area formula for conformal metrics.

In two dimensions, the area element for a conformal metric is given by sqrt(g) dxdy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal and each component is multiplied by the same function, the determinant should be [f]^2, where f is the function multiplying dx² + dy². Wait, no, wait. The metric tensor components are g_xx = f, g_yy = f, and the off-diagonal terms are zero. So the determinant is (f)(f) - 0 = f². So the area element dA is sqrt(f²) dx dy = f dx dy.

Wait, but the function here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area would be the integral of (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy over the region where the metric is defined.

But wait, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So the metric becomes singular when 4 - x² - y² approaches zero, i.e., when x² + y² approaches 4. So the domain of x and y is where x² + y² < 4. So the region is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps this metric describes a pseudosphere with radius 2. But wait, I'm a bit confused because the radius in the metric... Hmm, maybe the radius is given by the curvature. In hyperbolic geometry, the radius is related to the curvature, which is negative.

Wait, I think the area of a hyperbolic plane is infinite, but a pseudosphere (which is a surface of constant negative curvature) might have a finite area if it's compact, like a hyperbolic space embedded in a certain way. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the given metric is that of a two-dimensional pseudosphere, and the area is similar to the sphere but with a different formula.

Wait, the usual pseudosphere in two dimensions is sometimes called the hyperbolic plane, but that's non-compact and has infinite area. So if the metric here is representing a compact hyperbolic surface, perhaps the area is different. But I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is for a sphere in some coordinate system. Wait, the denominator is 4 - x² - y². So if x² + y² <4, then the denominator is positive. If x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, and the metric blows up, which suggests that the boundary is at radius 2 in the x-y plane.

Wait, but this is a 2D metric, so the space described is a 2D surface. If I'm integrating over x and y within x² + y² <4, the area would be the integral of (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy over that disk.

Wait, let's compute that integral. So the area A is ∫∫ (32/(4 - r²)) r dr dθ, where r is the polar coordinate and θ is the angle. So changing to polar coordinates:

A = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ

Because in polar coordinates, dx dy = r dr dθ. So we can separate the integrals:

A = (32) * 2π ∫ (r=0 to 2) [r / (4 - r²)] dr

Let me compute that integral. Let u = 4 - r², then du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr = ∫ (-1/2) (1/u) du = (-1/2) ln|u| + C.

So the definite integral from 0 to 2:

At r=2: u=4 -4=0 → ln(0) is negative infinity. Wait, but when r approaches 2 from below, u approaches 0 from above, so ln(u) approaches -infinity.

Wait, let's compute the integral:

∫ from 0 to 2 of [ r/(4-r²) ] dr = [ (-1/2) ln(4 - r²) ) ] from 0 to 2.

At r=2: ln(0) approaches -infinity. So (-1/2) ln(0) is positive infinity. At r=0: ln(4) is a finite value.

So the integral becomes:

( (-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] ) = ( (-1/2) ( -infty - ln4 )) → ( (-1/2) (-infty) ) → positive infinity.

So the integral ∫ [r/(4-r²)] dr from 0 to 2 is infinity. Therefore, A = 32 * 2π * infinity → which is infinity.

Wait, but that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the setup?

Wait, the metric is given as (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So the area is the integral of that over x and y. But the denominator approaches zero, so the area element becomes infinite as x² + y² approaches 4. So integrating over the entire disk would give an infinite area. But the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2. Hmm.

Wait, but the question says, "What is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2?" So perhaps the area is finite. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a metric for a compact pseudosphere, which would have a finite area. But in that case, the integration over x and y would not cover the entire disk, but only the part that's the pseudosphere. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the metric is for a compact surface, and the area is finite.

Wait, another approach. For a sphere in 3D, the area is 4πr². For a pseudosphere, perhaps it's a similar formula but with a negative radius? Or maybe the same formula but with a different coefficient.

Looking back at the options:

Option A) 0 → No, that doesn't make sense.

Option B) 4π(x² + y²) → Hmm, but the options are functions of x and y, which suggests they aren't the area of the entire pseudosphere.

Option C) 4π(x² - y^2) → Same issue as B.

Option D) +infty → That's possible if the area is infinite.

Wait, earlier calculation suggested the area is infinite. So option D is a possibility.

But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. So maybe the pseudosphere has a finite area. Let me think again about the metric.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is for a compact surface, like a Riemann sphere, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another thought: the given metric is ds^2 = (32/(4 - x² - y²))(dx^2 + dy^2). Let me write this as ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) dr² + (32/(4 - r²)) r² dθ², where r² = x² + y². So this is in polar coordinates.

Wait, perhaps this is similar to the metric of a sphere. For a sphere of radius a, the metric in polar coordinates is a² dr²/(a² -r²) + a² (a² - r²) dθ². Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the standard metric for a sphere in 2D is different. Wait, 2D sphere is embedded in 3D, but perhaps the metric in some coordinate system would have terms like 1/(1 - r²/a²) for a conformally flat metric. Alternatively, maybe it's a hyperbolic metric.

Wait, hyperbolic space in 2D has a metric like dr²/(1 - r²/k²) + (r²/k²) dθ², where k is the curvature. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the terms.

Wait, but the given metric is (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²). Wait, that's not the standard form for hyperbolic space, because hyperbolic usually has terms like (dr²)/(1 - r²) + r² dθ², but that depends on the coordinate system.

Wait, but the key point is that the area from the integral is infinite. So if the area element is 32/(4 - r²) r dr dθ, and integrating from r=0 to 2, you get an infinite area, which would mean option D is correct.

But why would the question mention a pseudosphere of radius 2? Oh, wait, perhaps the radius in the metric corresponds to a certain curvature.

Wait, another approach: the Gaussian curvature K for a conformal metric ds² = f² (dx² + dy²) is given by K = - (1/(2f)) Δ f, where Δ is the Laplacian in flat space. So let's compute K.

Given f = sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)). So f = sqrt(32) / sqrt(4 - r²).

Wait, let's compute K. The formula is K = - (1/(2f)) ( ∇² f ), where ∇² is the Laplacian in 2D.

Let me compute f(r) = sqrt(32)/(sqrt(4 - r²)), where r² = x² + y².

So f(r) = sqrt(32) * (4 - r²)^(-1/2).

Compute the Laplacian of f in polar coordinates. The Laplacian is (1/r) d/dr (r df/dr).

First, compute df/dr:

df/dr = sqrt(32) * (-1/2) (4 - r²)^(-3/2) * (-2r) ) = sqrt(32) * (r) (4 - r²)^(-3/2).

So df/dr = sqrt(32) * r / (4 - r²)^(3/2).

Now, compute the derivative of r df/dr with respect to r:

d/dr [ r df/dr ] = df/dr + r d²f/dr².

Wait, but maybe I should compute it step by step.

Alternatively, compute the Laplacian:

∇² f = (1/r) d/dr [ r df/dr ].

So let's compute:

d/dr [r df/dr ] = d/dr [ r * (sqrt(32) r ) / (4 - r²)^(3/2) ) ]

Simplify the expression inside:

r * (sqrt(32) r ) = sqrt(32) r².

Denominator: (4 - r²)^(3/2).

So, d/dr [ sqrt(32) r² (4 - r²)^(-3/2) ) ]

Let me compute this derivative:

Let me set u = r², v = (4 - r²)^(-3/2).

Using product rule: d/dr [ sqrt(32) u v ] = sqrt(32) ( du/dr * v + u * dv/dr )

du/dr = 2r.

dv/dr = (-3/2) (4 - r²)^(-5/2) * (-2r) ) = (3 r) (4 - r²)^(-5/2).

So, putting it together:

sqrt(32) [ 2r (4 - r²)^(-3/2) + r² * 3 r (4 - r²)^(-5/2) ) ]

Factor out sqrt(32) * r (4 - r²)^(-5/2) ) * [ 2 (4 - r²) + 3 r² ]

Wait, let's compute each term:

First term: 2r (4 - r²)^(-3/2) = 2r (4 - r²)^(-3/2) = 2r (4 - r²)^(-3/2) * (4 - r²)^(-2/2) ) * (4 - r²)^(2/2) Wait, maybe better to factor the denominator.

Wait, let me compute the two terms inside the brackets:

Term1: 2r (4 - r²)^(-3/2)
Term2: 3 r^3 (4 - r²)^(-5/2)

So factor out (4 - r²)^(-5/2):

= (4 - r²)^(-5/2) [ 2r (4 - r²) + 3 r^3 ]

Because (4 - r²)^(-3/2) = (4 - r²)^(-5/2) * (4 - r²)^(+1).

So:

= (4 - r²)^(-5/2) [ 2r (4 - r²) + 3 r^3 ]

Expanding inside:

= (4 - r²)^(-5/2) [ 8r - 2 r^3 + 3 r^3 ]

= (4 - r²)^(-5/2) [ 8r + r^3 ]

So now, the derivative of [r df/dr] is sqrt(32) * (8 r + r^3)/(4 - r²)^(5/2).

Now, the Laplacian is (1/r) times this:

∇² f = (1/r) * [sqrt(32) (8r + r^3)/(4 - r²)^(5/2) ) ].

Simplify:

= sqrt(32) (8 + r²) / [ r (4 - r²)^(5/2) ) ].

Now, Gaussian curvature K is given by - (1/(2f)) * ∇² f.

So f = sqrt(32)/(4 - r²)^(1/2).

So 1/(2f) = (4 - r²)^(1/2) / (2 * sqrt(32)).

So K = - [ (4 - r²)^(1/2) / (2 sqrt(32)) ) ] * [ sqrt(32) (8 + r²) / ( r (4 - r²)^(5/2) ) ) ]

Simplify:

The sqrt(32) cancels out. So:

K = - [ (4 - r²)^(1/2) ) / (2) ) ] * [ (8 + r²) / ( r (4 - r²)^(5/2) ) ) ]

Simplify the exponents:

(4 - r²)^(1/2) divided by (4 - r²)^(5/2) is (4 - r²)^(-2).

So:

K = - [1/(2) ] * (8 + r²) / ( r (4 - r²)^2 ) )

Hmm, this looks a bit messy. But perhaps the curvature depends on r, which would mean it's not a constant curvature space. Wait, but a pseudosphere should have constant negative curvature.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the metric has constant curvature.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the Gaussian curvature at a point, but perhaps it's better to think about whether the integral for the area converges or not.

But earlier, integrating the area element leads to an infinite area, which would suggest that the area is infinite. So looking back at the options, option D is +infty.

So then the correct answer would be D.

The metric provided is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which is a conformally flat metric in two dimensions. To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we calculate the area element for this metric. For a conformal metric \( ds^2 = f^2(dx^2 + dy^2) \), the area element is \( dA = f \, dx \, dy \). Here, \( f = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \), so the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \)), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The region of integration is the disk where \( r^2 < 4 \), i.e., \( r \in [0, 2) \). Thus, the total area \( A \) is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

Separating the integrals, we have:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Let \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \), or \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{1}{u} \, du = -\frac{1}{2} \left[\ln u\right]_4^0.
\]

As \( r \to 2 \), \( u \to 0 \), and \( \ln u \to -\infty \). Thus, the integral diverges to infinity:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = +\infty.
\]

This means the total area \( A \) is infinite. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as this is not a constant value for the entire pseudosphere.
- **C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as this is not a constant value for the entire pseudosphere.
- **D) \( +\infty \)**: Correct, as the integral for the area diverges.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite.
