Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, the question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, and the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the question is about finding the correct equation relating the effective temperatures T1 and T2 under LTE conditions.

Wait, LTE stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So I think that means the conditions where the gas behaves according to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Right, in LTE, the population of energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution.

The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

In this case, the energy levels are E2 and E1, and the ratio is given as 2 for star_1 compared to star_2. Wait, no, wait. The problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So let me clarify: I think that means that in star_1, the number of atoms in the excited state is twice that of star_2. Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of the excited level to the ground state? Or is it the ratio of star_1's excitation to star_2's? Let me read the question again.

"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the number of atoms in that specific excited level in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n1_excited / n2_excited = 2.

Wait, but the energy difference is given. Let's say the energy levels are E1 (lower) and E2 (higher). The excitation energy is delta E = E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J.

So for each star, we can write the ratio of the excited state to the ground state. Let me denote for star 1: n1_2 / n1_1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - delta E / (k T1) )

Similarly for star 2: n2_2 / n2_1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - delta E / (k T2) )

But the question says that n1_2 is twice n2_2. Wait, no. It says the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited as those in star_2. So perhaps the ratio (n1_2 / n1_1) is twice (n2_2 / n2_1). Or wait, perhaps it's that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2, but that might be more complicated because it depends on the total number of atoms, which is probably the same? Or maybe the ratio is of the relative excitation.

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So for a specific energy level, the excitation is higher, meaning more atoms are in that level in star_1 than in star_2. So perhaps the ratio of excited to ground state (or perhaps to the total) is higher. But in Boltzmann terms, it's the ratio between two energy levels. Let's say the ground state is level 1 and the excited state is level 2. Then, for star 1, the ratio is (n2/n1)_1 = (g2/g1) exp( - delta E/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star 2, (n2/n1)_2 = (g2/g1) exp( - delta E/(k T2) )

According to the problem, the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So (n2/n1)_1 = 2 * (n2/n1)_2.

Substituting the expressions:

(g2/g1) exp( - delta E/(k T1) ) = 2 * (g2/g1) exp( - delta E/(k T2) )

Ah, the (g2/g1) terms cancel out. So we have:

exp( - delta E/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( - delta E/(k T2) )

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

- delta E/(k T1) = ln(2) - delta E/(k T2 )

Let me rearrange this equation. Let's bring the delta E/(k T2) term to the left and the others to the right:

delta E/(k T2) - delta E/(k T1) = ln(2 )

Factor delta E/(k):

delta E/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2 )

Which is:

delta E/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2 )

Hmm, what's delta E here? Wait, delta E is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, wait, 1.38 is a familiar number. Oh wait, Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So delta E is equal to k*T? Or is that a coincidence? Let me check: 1.38e-23 J is exactly k (since k=1.38e-23 J/K).

Wait, so delta E = E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J. So delta E = k * T, where T is some temperature. Wait, but wait, if delta E = k*T, then for a given T, the thermal energy is on the order of the energy spacing. But in our case, the delta E is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k.

Wait, perhaps this is a setup. Let's go back to the equation:

delta E/(k) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2 )

But delta E = k * (something). Let me compute delta E / k:

delta E = 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So delta E / k = (1.38e-23)/(1.38e-23) ) = 1 K.

So the equation becomes:

1 * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

So,

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So the correct equation is option D.

The question involves determining the correct equation relating the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of two stars under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The problem states that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2, and the energy difference between the levels is \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \).

Under LTE, the population of energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( n_2 \) and \( n_1 \) are the populations of the excited and ground states, \( g_2 \) and \( g_1 \) are the degeneracies, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the ratios of excited to ground state populations are:

\[
\frac{n_{2,1}}{n_{1,1}} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{2,2}}{n_{1,2}} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, so:

\[
\frac{n_{2,1}}{n_{1,1}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2,2}}{n_{1,2}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:

\[
\frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Canceling \( \frac{g_2}{g_1} \) from both sides:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), we find:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1.
\]

Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D.
