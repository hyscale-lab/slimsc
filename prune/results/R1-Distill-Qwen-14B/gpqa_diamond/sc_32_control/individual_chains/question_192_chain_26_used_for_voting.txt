Okay, I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let's see what it's about. So, we have an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is at a distance s from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. 

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the spherical conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Both L and l are greater than R. Also, there's an angle θ between l and s.

Hmm, so I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is uncharged initially, but then we have a charge inside the cavity, I think the conductor will redistribute any charges it has. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged, so how does that affect things?

I think when you place a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface will induce an opposite charge, and the outer surface will have no net charge if the total conductor is neutral. But wait, in this case, the conductor is uncharged, so when +q is placed in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the part facing the cavity) would have an induced -q charge. But the conductor itself was neutral, so the outer surface must have +q, right? Or wait, no, because the conductor can't create charge; the outer surface would have +q because the net charge on the conductor is zero. Wait, no, because the conductor is uncharged, but now it has an induced charge. Let me think again.

Wait, the conductor is initially neutral. When you put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (inside the cavity) will have an induced -q charge. To maintain the conductor's neutrality, the outer surface must have +q. Because the total charge on the conductor is the sum of inner and outer surfaces, which should remain zero? Wait, no, the conductor was initially neutral, so if the inner has -q, the outer must have +q so that the total charge is zero. Wait, but the conductor is uncharged in the beginning, so when the charge +q is placed inside, the conductor's inner surface gets -q, and the outer surface must then have +q, making the total charge of the conductor zero again. So the outer surface has a net charge of +q.

But wait, the conductor is a conductor, so charges can move freely. The outer surface's charge distribution would depend on the shape of the cavity and where the charge is placed. But in this setup, the point P is outside the conductor, so maybe the charges on the outer surface will arrange themselves in a way that their contribution to the electric field at P is like a point charge at the center.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about what Gauss's Law says. For a spherical conductor with charge inside the cavity, the electric field outside the conductor is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. But wait, in this case, the conductor is uncharged except for the induced charges. So the outer surface has +q. So the total charge outside is +q. So when we apply Gauss's Law outside the conductor, the flux through a Gaussian surface outside would be due to the total enclosed charge, which is +q. Therefore, the E field at point P (outside) would be as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. But the charge inside the cavity is placed at some position, but the outer surface's charge distribution makes the field outside depend only on the total charge on the outer surface. So the field outside should be the same as that of a point charge +q at the center of the conductor, regardless of where the charge is placed inside the cavity. But wait, in this problem, the charge is placed somewhere inside the cavity, but the conductor's outer surface charge would rearrange such that the electric field outside is as if the charge were at the center. Because the field outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total charge outside, and the shape of the Gaussian surface.

So, for point P, the distance from the center of the conductor is L. So by Gauss's Law, the electric field E at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), since the charge enclosed is +q, and the Gaussian surface is a sphere of radius L. So the direction would be radially outward, but the problem just asks for the magnitude.

Looking at the options, option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Option D is q/(l²), but l is the distance from P to the cavity center, which is not the same as L, the distance from the conductor center. So option B would make sense.

But wait, what about the position of the charge inside the cavity? The problem says the center of the cavity is s away from the conductor's center, and the charge is placed somewhere inside the cavity. I thought that the induced charges would make the field outside depend only on the total outer charge, but perhaps I should think about the image method or something else.

Wait, in a spherical cavity inside a conductor, the field inside the conductor is zero. But any point outside the conductor would feel the field due to the charges on the outer surface. Since the outer surface has +q, the field at any point outside is as if it's a point charge +q at the center of the conductor. So regardless of where the charge is placed inside the cavity, the field outside is same as if the charge is at the center.

So for point P, which is outside the conductor, the electric field would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L².

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that. So the correct answer should be option B.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Setup and Induced Charges**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (facing the cavity) induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$. To maintain the conductor's neutrality, the outer surface must have a charge of $+q$.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface. Since the outer surface has a net charge of $+q$, the electric field at any point outside the conductor is as if the charge $+q$ were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

3. **Application of Gauss's Law**: At point $P$, which is a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor, the electric field is determined by the total charge on the outer surface, $+q$. Using Gauss's Law, the magnitude of the electric field at $P$ is:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
   \]
   This result is independent of the position of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity or the geometry of the cavity itself, as the field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression involves $l - s \cos\theta$, which is not relevant for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option B**: Correct. Matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The expression involves $l + s \cos\theta$, which is not relevant for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The distance $l$ is the distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity, not the center of the conductor, and does not apply here.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: B
