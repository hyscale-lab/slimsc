Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. It's about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just use classical mechanics; you need to use special relativity. 

Alright, let me read the question again. So, the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, each with different values for v_rel and E.

Wait, relative speed. I think in relativity, adding velocities isn't as straightforward as just adding them. Oh right, you can't just say 0.6c plus 0.5c because that would be 1.1c, which is faster than light, which isn't possible. So the formula for relative velocity is different. I remember it's something like (v1 - v2) divided by (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Or wait, is it (v1 + v2)/(1 + (v1 v2)/(c²)) when they're moving towards each other? Or wait, no, in this case, both are moving in the same direction, so I think the relative velocity would be (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). But wait, both are moving in the same direction—so one is moving faster than the other. So the relative speed is the difference of their speeds, but corrected by the Lorentz factor.

Wait, the formula for relative velocity when both are moving in the same direction. Let me think. Suppose I have two objects moving in the same direction with speeds u and v, measured from the same frame. So the relative speed between them in the rest frame would be u - v. But under relativity, it's (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). Because if u and v are both close to c, you have to adjust for the relativity of simultaneity and the contraction of lengths.

So in this problem, astronaut 1 has speed 0.6c, astronaut 2 has speed 0.5c. So the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = (0.1c)/(0.7) = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's one part.

Now, the total energy of the system. Hmm. Each astronaut is moving, so their energies are relativistic. The total energy would be the sum of their individual relativistic energies. The relativistic energy equation is E = gamma * m c². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So let's compute each of their energies. 

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. So gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2 ) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) → 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2 m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2/c^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c^2. Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc², which is less. So the correct option would be C.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations. E1: 2m * gamma1. Gamma1 is 1.25, yes. So 2 * 1.25 is 2.5. Correct. Gamma2: sqrt(0.75) is about 0.866, so gamma is 1/0.866 ≈ 1.1547. 3m * 1.1547 is approximately 3.464 m. So 2.5 + 3.464 is 5.964, which rounds to 5.96. So yes, option C.

So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy is about 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C matches both.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
