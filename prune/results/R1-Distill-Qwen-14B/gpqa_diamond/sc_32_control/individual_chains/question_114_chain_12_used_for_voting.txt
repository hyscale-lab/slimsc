Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for the given reactions. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So that's acetone. Acetone reacting with sodium cyanide... Oh, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's a substitution reaction. But wait, substitution on the carbonyl group? So, the carbonyl (C=O) would become C-CN. Oh, but wait, that's more like a nucleophilic addition followed by elimination, but in this case, the product looks like a hydroxy nitrile.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The structure would be CH2-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, butanenitrile has four carbons. So the nitrile is on the second carbon, and the hydroxyl is also on the same carbon. So the structure is (CH2)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO.

So the reaction is (CH3)2CO + NaCN → (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, how does that happen? Oh, maybe it's a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl. So the acetone's carbonyl oxygen is attacked by the cyanide ion. So the mechanism would be: the carbonyl oxygen becomes an O- which then leaves as OH- or something. Wait, but in the product, we have a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group on the same carbon. That makes me think of the hydroxy group as being from the original carbonyl oxygen, but with the cyanide replacing the oxygen.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where the carbonyl is replaced by CN. But that would give (CH3)2CCN, but that doesn't fit. Oh wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The formula would be (CH2)2C(OH)CN. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the ketone is converted to a nitrile via a cyanohydrin. Oh right, when a ketone reacts with cyanide in the presence of an acid catalyst, it forms a cyanohydrin. So the mechanism would be acid catalysis. So the reagent A is probably an acid.

Wait, so the first step is butan-2-one plus NaCN and acid (like H3O+ or H2SO4) to form the cyanohydrin. That makes sense. Because the nucleophilic attack by CN- on the carbonyl would require the carbonyl to be activated, which is done by protonating the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. So the acid (like H3O+) is the reagent A.

So for reaction 1, A is H3O+.

Now, moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. And it's treated with reagent B (which is H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, so the nitrile group is being converted to a carboxylic acid. How does that happen? The usual way to convert nitriles to carboxylic acids is through hydrolysis. But the conditions matter. There are different methods: acidic, basic, or using other reagents.

Wait, the reagent B is H2O. So perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction. But the problem statement says that reagent B is H2O, but what's the actual condition? Because hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires strong acid or base conditions, sometimes with heat.

Wait, in the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is H2O. But perhaps the conditions are either acidic or basic. Let me think about the reagents in the options.

Looking at the options, for the second reagent B:

Option A: B=HCl
Option B: B=CH3COOH
Option C: B=HCl
Option D: B=CH3COOH

Wait, no, looking again, the options are:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

Wait, no, the question says for reaction 2, the reagent is B and the solvent is H2O. So the reagent B is either HCl, CH3COOH, etc. So in the second reaction, the setup is that the reagent is B, and the solvent is water.

Wait, no, the way the question is phrased:

In reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product.

In reaction 2: the compound + B (H2O) → product.

Wait, so reaction 2 uses reagent B in H2O. So the actual reaction is hydrolysis. For nitrile to carboxylic acid, what reagents are used?

Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be done under acidic or basic conditions. For example, using H2O with HCl (acidic) or using a base like aqueous NaOH.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid. So if the reaction is in H2O with HCl, that's an acid condition. Alternatively, in aqueous base, perhaps with H2O and an acid workup.

Wait, the reaction conditions may vary. If the reagent B is HCl (like option A and C), that would be acidic. If it's CH3COOH (option B and D), that's also acidic.

Wait, but for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, sometimes you need to use a strong acid, like HCl, along with heat. Alternatively, using a mild acid might not be sufficient, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but another possibility is that the nitrile is being oxidized to a carboxylic acid. But oxidation of nitriles usually requires specific conditions, like using KMnO4 under acidic conditions. But in the presence of water, perhaps in H+.

Alternatively, hydrolysis in acidic conditions. So for the second reaction, if the reagent is HCl (acid), then the nitrile group (-CN) would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

So for the second reaction, the reagent B is HCl. So looking at the options, which ones have B as HCl?

Option A: B=HCl

Option C: B=HCl

So the options A and C have B as HCl.

Now, going back to the first reaction. The first reagent A is the catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation. So the first part is butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. And I thought A is an acid, like H3O+.

Looking at the options, options A and B have A=H3O+. Options C and D have A=NaHSO3.

Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which is a source of H+ and SO3^2-.

Wait, but for cyanohydrin formation, I think you need an acid catalyst. So H3O+ (from H2SO4 or HCl) would be the acid. So the first reagent A is H3O+.

So in options, A is H3O+ in options A and B.

So from the first reaction, A is H3O+.

Second reaction, B is HCl. So looking at the options, option A has A=H3O+ and B=HCl. So that would fit.

Wait, but let me check the reaction again. Reaction 2 is in H2O, with reagent B. So if B is HCl, then the reaction is done in acidic aqueous conditions. That should hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, if B were a base, then perhaps the nitrile would hydrolyze to an amide or something else, but I think in this case, the product is a carboxylic acid, so acid conditions are more likely.

So putting it together:

Reaction 1: A = H3O+ (so options A or B)

Reaction 2: B = HCl (so options A or C)

Only option A has both A=H3O+ and B=HCl.

So the correct option is A.

Wait, but let me think about that more. Are there any other possibilities?

Wait, another thought: could the second reagent be something else? For example, maybe the second reaction is not a hydrolysis but an oxidation. Wait, but the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group attached. But the product is a carboxylic acid. So maybe the nitrile is oxidized to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, the reaction is in H2O with B as reagent. So if B is a strong oxidizing agent in acidic conditions, maybe that would work. But the options don't provide any oxidizing agents. So perhaps it's a hydrolysis.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is done in basic conditions, but the options for B are HCl (acid) or acetic acid (acid). So likely, it's acid.

So, in the options, the only option where A is H3O+ and B is HCl is option A.

So the answer should be option A.

The first reaction involves butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, which typically requires an acid catalyst to activate the carbonyl group for nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (option A) is a suitable acid catalyst for this reaction.

The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B in the presence of H₂O to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is a hydrolysis reaction where the nitrile group (-CN) is converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically occurs under acidic or basic conditions. Among the options, HCl (option A) provides the necessary acidic environment for this reaction to proceed.

From the analysis, the correct combination of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which corresponds to option A.
