Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. It says to assume that stars are uniformly distributed, and I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with a different power of 1/plx.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax plx is the angle subtended by the Earth's orbit at the star's position. The formula I think is distance d (in parsecs) equals 1 divided by plx. So d = 1/plx. That makes sense.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So if the stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density is the same in all regions. Uniformly distributed in space, I suppose.

Let me think about a volume of space. The number of stars should be proportional to the volume, right? Because if they're uniformly distributed, more volume means more stars.

Now, the volume in 3D space depends on the radius cubed. Oh, wait, but how does that relate to parallax? Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so a small plx means the star is far away.

Okay, so let's model this. Suppose I consider a thin shell at a distance d, with thickness dr. The volume of that shell is approximately 4πd² dr. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the shell's volume is the difference between two such spheres at d+dr and d, but for small dr, it's approx 4πd² dr.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax, so I need to express everything in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, then dr is the change in distance, which would relate to the change in plx. Let's see: plx = 1/d, so d plx = -1/d² dd. Hmm, so dd = -d² d plx. Wait, perhaps I need to express dr in terms of d plx.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let's see: the volume element in terms of distance is 4πd² dd. But since we're looking for stars per unit plx, I need to change variables from d to plx.

So, plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. Taking differentials: dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Wait, the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But since we're dealing with small increments, maybe I can ignore the sign for now.

So the volume element in terms of plx is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx² d plx). But the negative is just the direction, so the magnitude is 4π (1/plx²) (1/plx²) d plx? Wait, no, I think I messed that up. Let me think again.

Wait, the volume element in terms of d is 4πd² dd. Now, substituting d = 1/plx, we get:

d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) d plx.

So replacing d and dd into the volume element:

Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx²) d plx.

Wait, but that's 4π * (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) ) * d plx. Because the negative just changes the sign, but I'm considering the magnitude for the number of stars.

So Volume = 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

But wait, that's a bit confusing. Because the number of stars is the volume multiplied by the number density (assuming uniform distribution). So if the number density is n (number per unit volume), then the number of stars in a shell is n * Volume.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So per unit plx, how many stars? So it's number of stars per d plx. So the number per unit plx would be n * Volume per d plx.

Wait, let's think in terms of the number per unit plx interval. So for a small d plx, the number of stars is proportional to the volume in that plx interval.

So the number of stars in a plx range from plx to plx + d plx is N = n * Volume.

But Volume is 4π d² dd, and we have d = 1/plx. So substituting, Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd). But dd is related to d plx.

Wait, since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. So substituting, Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - 1/plx² d plx ). Again, the negative is just the direction, so for magnitude, it's 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

Thus, N = n * 4π (1/plx^4) d plx. So the number per unit plx is N/(d plx) ) = 4π n (1/plx^4).

But wait, the question is phrased as the number of stars per unit range of plx. So if you have a range of plx from plx to plx + d plx, then the number of stars is N = n * Volume. So the number per unit plx is N/(d plx) = (n * Volume) / (d plx).

Wait, but Volume is 4πd² dd = 4π (1/plx)^2 ( -1/plx^2 d plx ). So the Volume is proportional to (1/plx^4) d plx. So when you divide N (which is n*Volume) by d plx, you get (n *4π / plx^4).

So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. Wait, but that's option A.

But wait, I'm starting to get confused. Let me think differently. Let's assume that the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume. Since the distribution is uniform, the number density n is constant.

Volume as a function of distance d is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4πd² dd.

Now, for a given parallax range. Let's say we have a small change in plx, d plx. Since plx = 1/d, d plx = - (1/d²) dd → dd = -d² d plx. Substituting d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) d plx.

Wait, so the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is n * 4πd² dd. Substitute dd as above:

n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx²) d plx )

The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But for the magnitude, it's n * 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number of stars in that shell is proportional to 1/plx^4 * d plx.

Wait, but the question is the number of stars per unit plx. So the number per unit plx is:

Number per d plx = (n * 4π (1/plx^4) d plx ) / (d plx)

Which simplifies to n *4π (1/plx^4).

So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. Looking back at the options, that's option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the number of stars in a given shell (same distance) would depend on d². But since we're considering a change in plx, which is 1/d, the relation changes.

Wait, another approach: think in terms of the differential number of stars as a function of plx.

The number of stars per unit volume is n. The volume element in terms of plx is dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx / (plx^2)) ) → because dV = 4π d² dd, and dd = ( - 1/plx^2 ) d plx.

So dV =4 π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/plx^2 ) d plx ) → 4 π (1/plx^4) d plx.

Thus, the number of stars is n dV = n *4 π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number per unit plx is (n *4 π / plx^4 ) → proportional to 1/plx^4, so option A.

Wait, but that would make the number of stars decrease with plx^4. So as plx increases (i.e., closer stars), you get more stars per unit plx.

Wait, that makes sense. Because when plx is small (d is large, so stars are far away), the number of stars in a given plx range would be fewer since the volume increases as 1/plx^4.

Wait no, wait: when plx is small, d is large. So for a given change in plx, the volume element is proportional to 1/plx^4. So when plx is small, 1/plx^4 is large, meaning more stars per unit plx. But that doesn't make sense because, at larger distances (smaller plx), the volume for a given plx interval is actually larger, leading to more stars.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing it up. Let me think about an example. Suppose plx is 1 parsec, so the star is 1 parsec away. The next plx is 2 (distance 0.5 pc). The volume element between plx=1 and plx=2 would be 4π (1/1)^2 * (1/1)^2 (d plx) → but wait, does that make sense?

Wait, no, because plx=1 corresponds to d=1, plx=2 corresponds to d=0.5. The shell between d=1 and d=0.5 (which is actually a closer distance, wait, no; plx increases as distance decreases. So plx=1 is 1 pc, plx=2 is 0.5 pc.

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Let me think about the volume element again. The volume element for a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in that shell is n *4πd² dd.

Now, since plx =1/d, dd = - (1/d²) d plx → d² = 1/(plx^2). So substituting:

Number of stars = n *4π (d²) * ( -1/d² d plx )

Which simplifies to n *4π (-d²)*(1/d²) d plx ) → n *4π (-1) d plx. Wait, that can't be right because the units don't make sense. Wait, I think I messed up the substitution. Let me do it again.

Number of stars = n *4π d² * ( - (1/d²) d plx )

Which is n *4π d² * (-1/d²) d plx → n *4π (-1) d plx.

Wait, that would be Number = -4π n d plx. But d is 1/plx, so substitute:

Number = -4π n (1/plx) d plx.

But that's a linear term in 1/plx. So per unit plx, the number is Number/(d plx) ) → (-4π n (1/plx) d plx ) / (d plx ) → -4π n / plx.

Wait, that's different. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx.

That would be option C.

Wait, that's conflicting with what I thought earlier. So perhaps I made a mistake in substituting.

Let me go through the substitution again.

Number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is n * 4π d² dd.

But plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx^2) d plx.

Substituting into the number of stars:

N = n *4π ( (1/plx)^2 ) ( -1/plx^2 d plx )

So N = n *4π (1/plx^2) * (-1/plx^2) d plx → n *4π (-1/plx^4) d plx.

The number per unit plx would be N / d plx → (n *4π (-1/plx^4) d plx ) / d plx → n *4π (-1/plx^4) → so the number is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because in the example, when plx is small (like 1), 1/plx^4 is 1, but when plx is 2, 1/16. So stars per unit plx would be fewer at higher plx. But when plx is small (like 1), the number per unit plx would be higher.

But that seems correct because closer stars (higher plx) are more numerous. Wait, no, wait: when plx is higher, the star is closer. So for each unit of plx, you have more stars as plx increases.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the number per unit plx decreases as plx increases. Because 1/plx^4 becomes smaller as plx increases.

Wait no, plx increases as the star gets closer. So if the number per unit plx is 1/plx^4, then as plx increases (stars get closer), the number per unit plx increases. So that makes sense because nearby stars are more densely packed in terms of plx.

So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/(plx^4), which is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought the correct answer was option C, but that was probably a mistake. So the correct answer must be option A.

Wait, but let me think about the units. Parallax is in arcseconds. Let's say we have a range of plx from plx to plx + d plx. The number of stars in that range would be the volume of the shell at distance plx with thickness corresponding to d plx, multiplied by the number density.

The volume of a shell at distance d is 4π d² dd, and the thickness in distance is dd. Since d = 1/plx, dd = (1/plx^2) d plx. Wait, no, because plx = 1/d → d plx = - dd / d².

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of integrating.

The number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + d plx is N = ∫ n * 4π d² dd from d = 1/(plx + d plx) to d = 1/plx.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, the number per unit plx is dN/d plx.

So dN = n *4 π d² dd. But since d = 1/plx, dd = ( -1/plx^2 ) d plx.

So dN = n *4 π (1/plx)^2 ( -1/plx^2 ) d plx ) → dN = -4 π n (1/plx^4) d plx.

Thus, dN/d plx = -4 π n (1/plx^4). The negative indicates that as plx increases, N decreases, but the magnitude is 4 π n / plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the correct option is A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: 

\[
d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}}.
\]

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance \(d\) with thickness \(dd\) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi d^2 dd.
\]

Substituting \(d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}}\), we find:

\[
dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}.
\]

Thus, the volume element in terms of parallax becomes:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = -\frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is proportional to the volume, so:

\[
dN = n \cdot \text{Volume} = -\frac{4\pi n}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx},
\]

where \(n\) is the number density of stars (constant due to uniform distribution). The number of stars per unit range of parallax is then:

\[
\frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} = -\frac{4\pi n}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

The negative sign indicates that the number of stars decreases as parallax increases (i.e., as stars move closer). The magnitude shows that the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to:

\[
\sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This matches option **A**.
