Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about.

The first part of the reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and a reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. When a ketone reacts with a cyanide like NaCN, what usually happens? I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. So maybe NaCN acts as a nucleophile here.

Wait, but in the product, we have a hydroxyl group and a nitrile. Oh, right! Maybe it's a two-step process. First, the ketone reacts with the cyanide. But wait, ketones typically react with nucleophiles like CN- in a nucleophilic addition, forming a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is when the nucleophile adds to the carbonyl group, creating a new alcohol and nitrile group.

So for the formation of a cyanohydrin, the reaction conditions are usually acid-catalyzed. The NaCN provides the CN- nucleophile, and then acid (H3O+ perhaps) protonates the carbonyl oxygen to make it a better leaving group. Then the CN- attacks, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin. So reagent A in this case would likely be an acid like H3O+.

Looking at the options, the first part of the reaction uses A. So options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a reagent used in the reduction of ketones to alcohols via the Wolff-Kishner reaction or maybe in some other reactions. But in this case, since we're adding a nitrile group, I think A should be H3O+.

So for the first part, A is H3O+ which is in options A and B. Now, moving on to the second reaction.

The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The product is a carboxylic acid. So we're going from a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

Nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. I remember that under strong acidic conditions with a strong oxidizing agent, nitriles can be oxidized. The typical reagents for this are H2O with an acid catalyst, perhaps HCl or H2SO4, and heat. Alternatively, KMnO4 in acidic conditions can oxidize nitriles to carboxylic acids.

Wait, wait. Let me think. Another possibility is using HCl as a catalyst in the hydrolysis. But nitrile hydrolysis usually gives either an amide or a carboxylic acid depending on the conditions. If it's acidic hydrolysis, perhaps with HCl and heat, the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid.

So the second reagent B must be something that helps in the oxidation or hydrolysis of the nitrile group. Looking at the options, the possible B reagents are HCl, CH3COOH, HCl again, or CH3COOH. So options A and B have B as HCl and CH3COOH, respectively.

Wait, but which conditions would work here. Let's think about the reaction again: the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. When you hydrolyze a nitrile group under acidic conditions, you typically get a carboxylic acid. So the reaction would be with H2O and an acid catalyst. But let's think about the reagents.

In the second part, the reagent is B, and it's used along with H2O. So if B is HCl, then it's HCl in water. That would provide the acidic environment. Alternatively, if B is CH3COOH (acetic acid), then it's a milder acid. Which one is more likely for this reaction?

The nitrile to carboxylic acid requires the nitrile to undergo hydrolysis. The reaction is usually done under strong acidic conditions. For example, using concentrated sulfuric acid and water, or HCl in aqueous solution. So option B could be HCl, which is a strong acid, so option A has B = HCl.

Wait, but what's the other option? Option B has B=CH3COOH. Is acetic acid sufficient for this hydrolysis? I think that for the oxidation of nitriles to carboxylic acids, you usually need stronger conditions. Acetic acid is a weaker acid compared to HCl, so maybe HCl would be needed.

So putting it together, for the first part, A is H3O+ (so options A and B), and for the second part, B is HCl (so option A has B=HCl, option C has B=HCl but A is NaHSO3 which we think is wrong).

Wait, no, in the second reaction, the reagent is B, but the options specify what B is. So the first reaction uses A, the second uses B.

So in the first reaction, the correct A is H3O+, which is options A and B.

In the second reaction, the correct B is HCl, which is option A.

Alternatively, if I'm wrong about the second reaction, perhaps the conditions are different. Let me think again.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The product is 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So it's a nitrile converting to a carboxylic acid. The reaction conditions for that are typically H3O+ or HCl in water, with heat.

Wait, another point: another way to convert nitriles to carboxylic acids is through hydrolysis using an acid catalyst. The reaction is:

R–CN + H2O (acid) → R–COOH

So the reagent would be H2O with acid. So the reagent B is the acid. So if the reaction is H2O and HCl (acid), then B is HCl. If the reaction uses H2O and acetic acid (B=CH3COOH), then perhaps it's a milder condition. But for full oxidation to the acid, HCl is likely needed.

So if the second step uses HCl, then looking at the options, option A has B = HCl.

So the first reagent A is H3O+ (so first part), and the second reagent B is HCl (so option A). So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So option A is our choice.

Wait, but another possibility: the first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. So for that, we need acid (H3O+), which is correct. The second reaction is nitrile to carboxylic acid, which requires HCl for the acid hydrolysis, so B is HCl. So option A is correct.

The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one (a ketone) to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation typically occurs via nucleophilic addition of cyanide (CN⁻) to the carbonyl group, catalyzed by an acid. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is the appropriate acid catalyst for this reaction, ruling out options C and D, which use NaHSO₃ as reagent A. Thus, the correct reagent A is H₃O⁺, narrowing the choices to options A and B.

The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid, which is the oxidation of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. This reaction typically requires acidic hydrolysis, where a strong acid like HCl provides the necessary conditions. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is a weaker acid and less suitable for this transformation. Therefore, the correct reagent B is HCl, which aligns with option A.

Combining both reactions, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
