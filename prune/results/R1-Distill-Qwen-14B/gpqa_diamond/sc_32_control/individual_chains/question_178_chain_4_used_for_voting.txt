Okay, so I've got this question about the Lagrangian in quantum field theory, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, and σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. The question is about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable.

First, I remember that in QFT, the mass dimension of fields and coupling constants helps determine renormalizability. A renormalizable theory has all its coupling constants with non-negative mass dimensions so that the theory doesn't require an infinite number of counterterms.

So, to find the mass dimension of κ, I need to find the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian and set them equal because the Lagrangian has to be dimensionless in natural units (since the action is dimensionless).

Let me recall the mass dimensions of the fields involved. In 4-dimensional spacetime (which is the usual for these kinds of theories), the fields have specific dimensions.

- The Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in 4D, the action is ∫d^4x L, so each field's dimension must be such that when you integrate, the action is dimensionless. So ψ has [ψ] = 3/2.

- The field strength tensor F^{μν} is from the electromagnetic (or gauge) field. The gauge field A has dimension 1, so F, being the derivative of A, has dimension 2. Because F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, each derivative adds one dimension, so F has [F] = 2.

Now, looking at σ_{μν}, which is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. The gamma matrices γ are dimensionless, so σ_{μν} must have the same dimension as the commutator of two γ matrices, which is zero. Because [γ_μ, γ_ν] is a tensor, but dimension-wise, since γ's are matrices, not fields, their commutator is dimensionless. So σ_{μν} has mass dimension 0.

Putting it all together, the Lagrangian term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Let's compute the mass dimension of each part:

- ψ̄ has the same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2.
- σ_{μν} is dimensionless, so 0.
- ψ is 3/2.
- F^{μν} is 2.

Multiply all together: (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = (3/2 *2) + 2 = 3 + 2 =5.

Wait wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the term is κ times ψ̄, σ, ψ, F. So the product of the fields is ψ̄ * ψ * F. Let me compute that:

ψ̄ is (3/2), ψ is (3/2), F is 2. So total for the fields: 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = (3+2) = 5? No, wait, 3/2 +3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. So the entire product (without κ) has dimension 5.

The Lagrangian term is κ times that, so the dimension is [κ] + 5. But the Lagrangian has to have dimension 4 in 4D, because it's integrated over four dimensions. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So setting [L_int] = 4, we have [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] =4-5= -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. That would correspond to options A or C, since those have [κ]=-1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the coupling constant's mass dimension. In a renormalizable theory, all coupling constants must have a mass dimension ≥ 0. Because if a coupling has negative mass dimension, it implies that the interaction becomes stronger at high energies (UV), leading to possible non-perturbative effects and the theory requiring an infinite number of counterterms, making it non-renormalizable.

In this case, [κ]=-1, which is negative. So the theory would not be renormalizable. Because any coupling with negative mass dimension implies that the interaction is relevant in the IR but irrelevant in the UV, but more importantly, in terms of renormalizability criteria, only couplings with mass dimension ≥0 are allowed for a renormalizable theory.

So putting it together: κ has mass dimension -1, and the theory isn't renormalizable. Looking at the options, option C says [κ]=-1 and theory is not renormalizable. Option A says theory is renormalizable, which can't be right because [κ] is negative.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \(\kappa\) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \(\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]\).

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
In 4-dimensional spacetime, the mass dimensions of the fields are:
- The Dirac spinor \(\psi\) has \([\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}\).
- The field strength tensor \(F^{\mu\nu}\) has \([F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2\).
- The commutator \([\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]\) is dimensionless, so \([\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0\).

### Step 2: Mass dimension of \(\kappa\)
The Lagrangian term \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}\) must have mass dimension 4 in 4D spacetime because the action \(\int d^4x \mathcal{L}\) is dimensionless. The term \(\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}\) involves the product of the fields:
- \([\bar{\psi}]_M = [\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}\),
- \([\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0\),
- \([\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}\),
- \([F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2\).

Adding these dimensions:
\[
[\bar{\psi}]_M + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M + [\psi]_M + [F^{\mu\nu}]_M = \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]

The Lagrangian term has the form \(\kappa \times \text{(fields)}\), so:
\[
[\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

Thus, the mass dimension of \(\kappa\) is \(-1\).

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions (\([\gkappa]_M \geq 0\)). In this case, \([\kappa]_M = -1\), which is negative. This implies that the interaction becomes stronger at high energies, leading to an infinite number of counterterms and making the theory non-renormalizable.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of \(\kappa\) is \(-1\), and the theory is not renormalizable. The correct option is:
