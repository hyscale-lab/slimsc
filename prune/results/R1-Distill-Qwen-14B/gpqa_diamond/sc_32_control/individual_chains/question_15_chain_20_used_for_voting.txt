Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh wait, their masses are the same, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter. So if Planet_2 has a period P, Planet_1 has P/3.

The host stars are interesting. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Oh, right, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they ended up with the same size. I think that affects the probability of transit.

I recall that the probability (P) of a planet transiting its star is roughly given by (R_s / a), where R_s is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Or wait, maybe it's (R_s / a) multiplied by something else? Oh, right, I think it's (R_s / a) multiplied by (something else, but maybe that's the main factor here). Alternatively, another formula I've heard is P = (R_star / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 + (m_planet/m_star)))), but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Wait, but the problem states that both planets have the same mass and same star radii, so maybe that part cancels out.

Wait, the transit probability is approximately (R*/a) * (something else?), but I think the main formula is P ≈ (R*/a) * (something else). No, wait, I think the exact formula is P = (R*/a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 + (m_planet/m_star))))). But given that m_planet is the same for both and m_star is different for each, but since the denominator is sqrt(1 + m_p/m_s), and m_p is same, m_s is different.

Wait, but let's think again. Alternatively, the transit probability is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. So P ∝ (R*/a). Because the planet has to be along our line of sight, which depends on a. So the probability increases if a is smaller, since R* is fixed for each star.

Wait, but both stars have the same radius. So R_s is the same for both. So R_s is same, so P is proportional to (1/a).

So let's compute a for each planet. Oh, but Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. Since M (star mass) is much larger than m (planet mass), we can approximate P² ≈ (4π²/(G M)) a³. So a³ = G M P² / (4π²). So a is proportional to (M P²)^(1/3).

So a = [ (G M P²) / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

But since G, 4π² are constants, a ∝ ( M * P² )^(1/3 )

So for Planet_1: M1 = 2 M2 (since Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's), and P1 = P2 /3.

So a1 ∝ (2 M2) * ( (P2/3)^2 ) )^(1/3 )

Let me compute a1/a2 ratio. Let's think in terms of a2.

Wait, a2 is for Planet_2. So a2 ∝ (M2) * (P2^2) )^(1/3 )

So a1 ∝ (2 M2) * (P2² / 9) )^(1/3 ) = [ 2 * (P2² /9) * M2 ]^(1/3 )

Which is [ (2/9) M2 P2² ]^(1/3 )

And a2 is [ M2 P2² ]^(1/3 )

So a1/a2 = [ (2/9) M2 P2^2 / ( M2 P2^2 ) ) ]^(1/3 ) = [ 2/9 ) ]^(1/3 )

2/9 is approximately 0.222. The cube root of that is about 0.606. So a1 is about 0.606 times a2.

Because a1 is smaller than a2.

Now, the transit probability P is proportional to (R*/a). Since R* is same for both, P1/P2 = (a2) / (a1) ) = (a2)/(0.606 a2) ) = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.648.

Wait, because P = (R*/a), so if a is smaller, P is larger. So P1 is (R*/a1) and P2 is (R*/a2), so P1/P2 = a2 / a1.

So since a1 is smaller than a2, a2/a1 is larger than 1. So P1 is larger than P2.

Wait, let me compute a1 and a2 correctly.

Wait, let me compute the ratio a1/a2.

a1 = [ (M1) * P1² ) ]^(1/3 )

M1 is 2 M2, P1 is P2/3.

So a1 = [ (2 M2) * ( (P2/3)^2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ 2 * (P2^2 /9) * M2 ]^(1/3 )

= [ (2/9) * M2 P2^2 ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ M2 * P2^2 ]^(1/3 )

So a1 = a2 * (2/(9))^(1/3 )

Which is a2 * (2/9)^(1/3 )

What's (2/9)^(1/3)? Let's compute that.

2/9 is about 0.2222.

Cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606.

So a1 = a2 * 0.606 → a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2.

So the transit probability is (R*/ a) → same R*, so P1 = R* / a1, P2 = R* / a2.

So P1/P2 = (R*/a1) / ( R*/a2 ) ) = a2 / a1.

Since a1 = 0.606 a2, a2/a1 = 1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65. So P1 is about 1.65 times P2.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher than for Planet_2 by a factor of about 1.65.

So the researchers would prefer Planet_1 because it has a higher probability of transiting.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times, which is much bigger. But according to our calculation, it's about 1.65.

So the correct choice is C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, \( P \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis (\( a \)).

Using Kepler's third law, \( a \propto (M \cdot P^2)^{1/3} \), where \( M \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet, we calculate the semi-major axis ratio \( \frac{a_1}{a_2} \). For Planet_1, \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) and \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \). Substituting these values:

\[
a_1 \propto (2M_2 \cdot (\frac{P_2}{3})^2)^{1/3} = (2 \cdot \frac{P_2^2}{9} \cdot M_2)^{1/3} = (2/9)^{1/3} \cdot (M_2 \cdot P_2^2)^{1/3}.
\]

For Planet_2:

\[
a_2 \propto (M_2 \cdot P_2^2)^{1/3}.
\]

Thus, the ratio \( \frac{a_1}{a_2} = (2/9)^{1/3} \). The cube root of \( 2/9 \) is approximately \( 0.606 \), so \( a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2 \). This means Planet_1's semi-major axis is smaller than Planet_2's.

The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), so:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65.
\]

Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. The researchers would prefer observing Planet_1 due to its higher transit probability.

From the options provided:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as Planet_2 does not have a higher probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as the probability ratio is not 1.5.
- **Option C**: Correct, as Planet_1 has a ~1.65 times higher probability.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as the probability ratio is not 2.7.
