Alright, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see... The question is about identifying a compound based on its molecular formula and NMR data, and then predicting the product after a series of reactions. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. I should calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, formula is C8H9NO. So, substituting, that's (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. Five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which is 3), a double bond, and maybe an aldehyde or ketone group (another double bond), so that's 5. Or maybe an aromatic ring plus some rings and double bonds.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a strong signal, which makes me think of an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Hmm, but wait, aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and appear as singlets because they don't have neighboring protons. Wait, unless it's part of a conjugated system. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton, like an aromatic -OH or something else. Wait, 9.72 could be an aldehyde or maybe a conjugated enone or something else, but the triplet is a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol or something else.

Then, 6.98 ppm is a doublet of 2H. That's probably aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted on a benzene ring? Because in para substitution, the protons are usually two, and they're split into a doublet due to coupling with adjacent protons. Wait, no. Wait, the splitting in aromatic regions is a bit tricky. For example, if you have two protons that are adjacent (like in ortho positions), but para would have each proton coupled with two others, leading to a doublet of doublets perhaps. Alternatively, maybe they're part of a coupling in a substituent.

Next, 6.51 ppm is another doublet for 2H. That's probably another set of aromatic protons, maybe in a different substituent. Maybe this is a para-substituted ring as well.

Then, 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an -OH proton, but wait, that's integrating for 2H. Wait, but -OH protons are usually around 1-5 ppm and can be broad. Alternatively, maybe it's part of an allylic system or a conjugated diene. Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with some substituents that cause the protons to be deshielded. Hmm.

3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That's probably adjacent to an electronegative atom. Maybe a CH2 group next to an O, like in a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps in an ether or an ester or an aldehyde... Wait, but the doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring group. So maybe a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like OCH2CH2... but then where?

Wait, putting this together: the aldehyde proton at 9.72, the aromatic protons, and the CH2 group. Maybe the compound is an aromatic aldehyde with substituents.

Looking at the options, they are all butenal or butanal derivatives with phenyl groups. Option A is 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal. Option B is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal. Option C is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. Option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.

Wait, but the starting compound has a molecular formula C8H9NO. Let's calculate the molecular formulas of the options.

Option A: 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal. The aldehyde is at position 3? Wait, but but-3-enal would be CH2CH2CH=CHCHO? Wait, no, but-3-enal is CH2=CHCH2CHO? Wait, but but-3-enal would be CH2CH2CH2CHO, but that's not possible because but-3-enal would imply a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, which isn't possible because butenals are four carbons. So perhaps but-3-enal is CH2CH2CH=CHO, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CHCH2CHO. But maybe I should think in terms of the structure.

Alternatively, considering the molecular formula. Let's count the atoms in each option.

The starting compound is C8H9NO. The reactions are: first, NaNO2 and HCl, which is a diazotization reaction. Then H2O, perhaps hydrolysis. Then KOH aqueous and heat, which might be a Claisen or aldol condensation, but more likely a hydrolysis or elimination.

Wait, but the reactions are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl → forms a diazonium salt.

2. H2O → hydrolysis, which typically would give phenol if it's a diazonium salt. Alternatively, maybe a coupling reaction, but with H2O, more likely hydrolysis.

Wait, wait, but if the starting material is a benzyl group attached to something else. Wait, perhaps the starting material is a phenyl group with a side chain that has a nitroso group or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is a benzophenone derivative but with an aldehyde group.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's see: benzene is C6H6. So the rest is C2H3NO. Let's see. So maybe a benzene ring with a substituent that is C2H3NO.

Hmm, C2H3NO could be something like OCH2CH2NO2, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe a nitro group and a CH2 group. Wait, no, not sure.

Looking again at the NMR data. Let's list the signals:

- 9.72 (t, 1H)
- 6.98 (d, 2H)
- 6.51 (d, 2H)
- 6.27 (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 (d, 2H)

Wait, the 9.72 ppm is a triplet, which suggests that the proton is coupled with two neighboring protons. But that's not common for an aldehyde proton, as they usually don't have neighboring Hs. So maybe it's not an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol tautomer. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the triplet at 9.72 could be a vinyl proton adjacent to an oxygen, like in a conjugated system. Maybe something like a conjugated enone. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic proton, but 9.72 is a bit high for that.

Wait, another possibility: the 9.72 could be a substituted aldehyde, perhaps an aromatic aldehyde, but why the triplet? Maybe the aldehyde is conjugated with a double bond. For example, in a cinnamaldehyde structure. But then, maybe the aldehyde proton is next to a CH2 group, but that doesn't explain the triplet. Alternatively, perhaps it's adjacent to a CH group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an enol form of a ketone, but enols are usually less downfield than aldehydes.

Moving on to the other signals: the two doublets at 6.98 and 6.51. These are probably aromatic protons. Let's imagine that the molecule has two para-substituted benzene rings. For a para-substituted ring, the protons are typically a doublet, as each H is next to one substituent. Wait, no. For a para substitution, each H is adjacent to two substituents. So the coupling would be between two Hs on adjacent carbons. Maybe in a biphenyl structure.

The 6.27 ppm could be a pair of protons that are not in an aromatic ring, perhaps in a vinyl or allylic position. The broad singlet suggests exchange, perhaps an -OH group, but integrating for 2H is confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's a pair of protons in a conjugated system, like adjacent to a carbonyl.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That suggests a CH2 group next to something else, perhaps an oxygen. Maybe an OCH2CH2 group. Or perhaps it's part of an ester or ether, but more likely adjacent to an electronegative atom.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is something like a benzaldehyde with a substituent that includes a CH2 group connected to another benzene ring. Or perhaps a benzene ring with a side chain that includes an aldehyde and some other groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a diphenyl compound with a side chain that includes an aldehyde and some double bonds.

Wait, considering the options again, let's look at the options' structures.

Option A: 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal.

Structure: The aldehyde is at position 3. So the buten chain would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CHO? Wait, no, butenals have four carbons. So but-3-enal would be CH2=CHCH2CHO. But if it's 2,4-diphenyl, the structure would have phenyl groups on carbons 2 and 4.

Wait, so perhaps:

Ph–CH2–CH2–CH=CHO–CHO? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the structure is:

Ph–CH2–CH(CHO)–Ph–CH2–? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

Ph–CH2–CH2–CH=CH–CHO, but that's five carbons, not four. Hmm, maybe I'm not getting it right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph–CH2–CH2–CH=CH–CHO. Wait, that's five carbons in the chain, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's Ph–CH2–CH2–CHO, but that doesn't fit the buten part.

Wait, maybe it's Ph–CH2–CH2–CHO, but that would be propanal with a phenyl group, but the formula is buten which is four carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's Ph–CH2–CH2–CH=CHO. Wait, but that's four carbons: CH2–CH2–CH=CHO. Hmm, maybe.

But perhaps I should move on to the reaction steps.

The reactions are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl → this is typically used to form a diazonium salt. So the starting material must have an aromatic amine or a nitro group. Wait, the molecular formula has a N, so perhaps the compound has a nitro group or an amine group.

Wait, the starting compound is C8H9NO. So N is present once. So perhaps it's a nitro group (-NO2), but that would take up two O's. Wait, let's see: the formula is C8H9NO. So the O could be part of a nitro group. Let me calculate: C8H9NO. If the N is in a nitro group, that would be -NO2. Then, O is part of that. So the rest would be C8H9N. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the N is in an amide group or a nitrile, but the formula has O as well.

Wait, but the reaction sequence: first, NaNO2 and HCl. That typically converts an aromatic amine to a diazonium chloride. So if the starting compound has an aromatic amine group (like -NH2), then the first step would form a diazonium salt.

But looking at the options, all of them don't have an -NH2 group. So wait, maybe the starting compound has a nitro group, which upon some reaction could get converted.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is a nitrobenzene derivative. But then, the first step with HCl and NaNO2 would be tricky because nitro groups aren't directly reactive under those conditions. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is a phenyl group with a side chain that includes an aldehyde and an amine. For example, something like benzaldehyde with an amine substituent. Then, the diazotization would occur on the amine.

But let's think again about the NMR data. The 9.72 ppm triplet: maybe it's not an aldehyde. Another thought: the triplet could be a vinyl proton next to a CH2 group. For example, in a structure like CH2=CH–O–, but that's a stretch.

Wait, considering the 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H. Maybe that's a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. So perhaps an ether or an ester.

Wait, putting it all together: maybe the structure is a benzalacetophenone? No, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a side chain that includes an aldehyde and an OCH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (salicylaldehyde) with some substituents. Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate for 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde: C7H6O2. That's less than C8H9NO. So maybe additional groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that includes a CH2 group connected to another benzene ring, and maybe a nitro or amino group.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try another approach. Let's think about the reaction steps. The first step is diazotization. So the starting compound must have an -NH2 group on an aromatic ring. Because NaNO2 and HCl in acidic conditions form a diazonium salt from an aryl amine.

Wait, but the options don't have an -NH2 group. So perhaps the starting compound is a nitro group, but I'm confused because nitro groups don't react with NaNO2 and HCl. Alternatively, maybe the starting compound has an amino group, and the reaction forms a diazonium salt which then undergoes hydrolysis.

Wait, the options don't have NH2 groups, so perhaps the starting compound isn't one of the options. Wait, but the question is about the product after the reactions. So the starting compound is the one with the given NMR data, and the product is one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzylamine derivative, but I'm not seeing it. Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound has a nitro group, which under certain conditions is reduced.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is a nitrobenzene derivative with an aldehyde group. Then, the reaction steps would convert it into something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step isn't diazotization but something else. Wait, NaNO2 and HCl can also be involved in the hydroxylamine formation or other reactions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the product after each reaction step.

1. NaNO2 + HCl: forms a diazonium salt.

2. H2O: hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol.

3. Aqueous KOH and heat: could be a nucleophilic substitution, or perhaps elimination.

Wait, but the starting material after reaction 1 is the diazonium salt. Then, in reaction 2, hydrolysis would replace the diazonium group (-N2+) with a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming a phenol.

So if the starting material is a benzene ring with an -NH2 group attached to a side chain containing an aldehyde and other groups, the diazonium salt would form, then hydrolysis would replace -NH2 with -OH, and then the third step would be treatment with KOH and heat. What does that do?

In aqueous KOH and heat, perhaps it's a condensation reaction or elimination. Alternatively, it could be a saponification if there's an ester, but the starting material doesn't seem to have one.

Wait, but if after the first two steps, the compound becomes a phenol, then the third step might involve elimination. For example, if there's a hydroxyl group and an adjacent leaving group, it could form a carbonyl group via elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the side chain has a structure that upon treatment with KOH and heat undergoes elimination to form an aldehyde or ketone.

Let me think about the starting compound: C8H9NO. If it's an aromatic amine, then after diazotization and hydrolysis, the N would be replaced by an OH. So the product after step 2 would be C8H9O2 (adding an OH and losing N and O from the diazonium salt).

Wait, the initial formula is C8H9NO. After replacing NH2 with OH, the formula becomes C8H8O2? Because NH2 is -N and two Hs. Replacing with OH would add one O and lose N and one H. Wait, the molecular formula would change from C8H9NO to C8H8O2.

But I'm not sure if that's the right way to approach it.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a nitrophenol derivative. But I'm not certain.

Let me try to think about the NMR data again. The triplet at 9.72 ppm. If it's not an aldehyde, maybe it's an aromatic proton with coupling. Alternatively, perhaps it's an enamine or something else.

Wait, another thought: the 9.72 could be a formyl group attached to something else, like a methine group. For example, R–CH(OH)–CHO. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the 9.72 is an aldehyde adjacent to a CH2 group. So the structure could be Ph–CH2–CHO, but then the aldehyde would be a triplet because the CH2 is next to it, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph–CH2–CH2–CHO. Then, the aldehyde proton would be a triplet because it's next to two CH2 groups. But then, the CH2 next to the aldehyde would split into a triplet. Wait, but the 9.72 is a triplet with one H. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system, like in a cinnamaldehyde derivative. The aldehyde proton in cinnamaldehyde is a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent vinyl protons. So perhaps in this case, the aldehyde proton is coupled with two vinyl protons, giving a triplet.

So, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with a double bond adjacent to the aldehyde group. For example, Ph–CH2–CH2–CH=CHO. No, that's five carbons. Alternatively, Ph–CH2–CH2–CHO with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph–CH2–CH=CHO. So, but that's four carbons in the chain: CH2–CH=CHO. But then, the aldehyde is at the end, and the CH2 and CH=CHO would be part of the chain.

In that case, the aldehyde proton would be next to a CH=CHO group. Wait, but that might not fit the NMR.

Alternatively, the structure is Ph–CH2–CH=CH–CHO. Then, the aldehyde is at the end, and the CH2 is next to a CH=CH group. The aldehyde proton would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. That fits the NMR data.

But the NMR also shows a doublet at 6.98 and 6.51, which are probably aromatic protons. So perhaps the benzene ring is attached to the CH2 group.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So, if the structure is Ph–CH2–CH=CH–CHO, that would be C7H7CHO (Ph is C6H5), which is C7H7O. Hmm, but that's not matching the formula. Our starting formula is C8H9NO.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more complex. Maybe the benzene has substituents that include an aldehyde and another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is a benzene ring with a side chain that includes a nitro group and an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is 4-nitrobenzaldehyde. But the formula would be C7H5NO3, which doesn't match. The starting formula is C8H9NO.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the reaction steps again.

After the first step, the diazonium salt is formed. Then, hydrolysis gives a phenol. So the product after step 2 would have an additional OH group, replacing the NH2.

Then, step 3 is KOH and heat, which could cause elimination. For example, if we have a phenol with a neighboring leaving group, it could eliminate to form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound has a structure where the diazonium group is part of a substituent that includes an aldehyde. Then, after hydrolysis, we get a phenol, and upon treatment with KOH and heat, it eliminates to form an aldehyde.

Wait, but the product options are all butenals or butanals with phenyl groups.

Option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. Structure would be CH2=CH–CH(Ph)–CHO. Where Ph is 4-hydroxyphenyl.

Wait, perhaps after the reactions, the product is an aldehyde with a hydroxyphenyl group attached.

Let me think about the starting structure. If the starting material is 4-amino-3-phenylbut-2-enal. Then, upon diazotization and hydrolysis, the amino group (-NH2) would be replaced by -OH, forming 4-hydroxy-3-phenylbut-2-enal. Then, under KOH and heat, perhaps it undergoes elimination.

Wait, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 4-amino-3-(4-nitrophenyl)but-2-enal. Then, upon diazotization, the amino group would form a diazonium salt, which upon hydrolysis would become a hydroxyl group, leading to 4-hydroxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal. Then, the third step with KOH and heat might cause some rearrangement or elimination.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde derivative with an amino group attached to the benzene ring, so when it's hydrolyzed, it becomes a phenol.

Wait, perhaps the starting structure is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with some substituents. But again, not matching the molecular formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting structure has a nitro group which is reduced during the reaction steps. But I'm not certain about that.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is a nitrobenzene derivative with an aldehyde group. So, for example, 4-nitrobenzaldehyde. Then, the first step with NaNO2 and HCl would not react because nitro groups don't form diazonium salts under those conditions. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzylamine derivative with an aldehyde group. For example, Ph–CH2–CH2–NH2. Then, the diazonium salt would form, and after hydrolysis, it becomes Ph–CH2–CH2–OH. Then, with KOH and heat, perhaps it undergoes elimination to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the starting material's formula is C8H9NO. Ph–CH2–CH2–NH2 would be C7H9N, which doesn't match. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is Ph–CH2–CH2–O–NO2, but that seems unlikely.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's consider the NMR data again. The triplet at 9.72 ppm for 1H. If it's an aldehyde, perhaps it's part of a conjugated system, and the coupling is with two adjacent protons. Let's say it's R–CH=CH–CHO or something similar.

In such a structure, the aldehyde proton would be adjacent to a CH=CH group, leading to coupling with two protons, hence a triplet.

Then, the aromatic protons would show up in the 6.5-7 ppm region. The two doublets could represent two sets of aromatic protons, perhaps in a para-substituted ring.

The 6.27 ppm broad singlet for 2H could be a pair of protons in a conjugated system, perhaps part of a vinyl group adjacent to the aldehyde.

The 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H suggests a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Maybe it's part of an oxygen-containing group, like an ether or an ester.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like Ph–CH2–CH2–CHO, but with a double bond elsewhere. Alternatively, Ph–CH2–CH=CHO.

But I'm not getting the exact structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a propenal (allyl) group attached, like Ph–CH2–CH=CHO.

In this case, the aldehyde proton would be next to the double bond, leading to the triplet.

Then, the CH2 group adjacent to the benzene would appear as a doublet at 3.66 ppm. Wait, but why would that be a doublet? If it's Ph–CH2–CH=CHO, the CH2 would be next to the CH=CHO group. The CH2 would split into a triplet because it's adjacent to a CH=CHO group with two protons. Hmm, that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph–CH2–CH2–CHO, but that wouldn't explain the triplet at 9.72.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph–CH2–CH2–CH2–CHO. Then, the aldehyde proton would be a singlet, not a triplet.

This is getting me nowhere. Let me think about the reaction steps again.

The first step forms a diazonium salt, which upon hydrolysis becomes a phenol. Then, treatment with KOH and heat could be a typical elimination reaction, perhaps converting an alcohol to an aldehyde or ketone via the E1 or E2 mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a structure where, after diazotization and hydrolysis, a secondary alcohol is formed, which upon elimination would form an aldehyde.

For example, if after the first two steps, the compound is Ph–CH2–CH(OH)–R, then under KOH and heat, it could eliminate to form Ph–CH2–CHO and release water.

But I'm not sure about the exact structure.

Looking at the options, option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. Structure is Ph–CH2–CH2–CH=CHO, but with a double bond between C3 and C4.

Wait, but but-3-enal would be CH2=CHCH2CHO. Hmm, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH–CH(Ph)–CHO, but with Ph being 4-hydroxyphenyl.

Alternatively, maybe it's CH2–CH2–Ph–CHO, but I'm not getting it.

Wait, let's think about each step's outcome.

1. Reaction with NaNO2 and HCl: forms a diazonium salt. So the starting material must have an -NH2 group attached to an aromatic ring.

2. Hydrolysis with H2O: converts the diazonium group to a phenol (-OH group).

3. Aqueous KOH and heat: perhaps eliminates a molecule of water, forming a carbonyl group. For example, if after step 2, there's a structure with adjacent OH and leaving group (like -O- or -OR), elimination could form a double bond and a carbonyl.

So, perhaps the starting material after step 2 is a diol or a phenol with a neighboring group that can eliminate.

Wait, perhaps the structure after step 2 is Ph–CH2–CH(OH)–CHO. Then, treatment with KOH and heat could eliminate H2O, forming Ph–CH2–CH=CHO, which is but-3-enal with a phenyl group.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material after step 2 is Ph–CH2–CH2–CH(OH)–R, and upon elimination, it forms Ph–CH2–CH=CH–R. But I'm not getting the exact structure.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Looking at the options, the product after the reactions is one of the aldehydes listed. Option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. Its structure is CH2=CH–CH(Ph)–CHO, where Ph is 4-hydroxyphenyl.

So, perhaps the starting material was a benzylamine derivative which upon diazotization and hydrolysis becomes a phenol, and then elimination forms the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-amino-3-phenylbut-2-enal. Then, the diazotization would occur on the amino group, forming a diazonium salt. Hydrolysis would replace the amino group with an OH, leading to 4-hydroxy-3-phenylbut-2-enal. Then, treatment with KOH and heat would eliminate a water molecule, converting the hydroxyl group into a carbonyl, perhaps forming the aldehyde.

Hmm, that might make sense.

So, after the third step, the OH group would be at position 4, and elimination would form a double bond and an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 3-phenyl-4-(4-aminophenyl)but-2-enal. Then, after hydrolysis, the amino becomes an OH, and elimination forms the aldehyde.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Given that, perhaps the correct product is option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.

So, the answer would be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound with the molecular formula **C8H9NO** and the given NMR data undergoes a series of reactions. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as 5, suggesting a combination of aromatic rings and double bonds. The NMR data indicates the presence of an aldehyde proton (triplet at 9.72 ppm), aromatic protons (doublets at 6.98 and 6.51 ppm), a broad singlet (6.27 ppm, likely from a conjugated system), and a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom (doublet at 3.66 ppm).

The reaction sequence is as follows:
1. **NaNO2 + HCl**: This step forms a diazonium salt, indicating the starting compound contains an aromatic amine (-NH2).
2. **H2O**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming a phenol.
3. **Aqueous KOH, Heat**: This step likely involves elimination, forming a carbonyl group (aldehyde or ketone).

The NMR data and reaction sequence suggest the starting compound is a benzene ring with a side chain containing an aldehyde and an amino group. After hydrolysis, the amino group is replaced by a hydroxyl group, forming a phenol. The final step with KOH and heat results in elimination, forming an aldehyde.

Among the options, **4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal** (Option D) matches the expected product. Its structure is consistent with the reaction sequence: a phenyl group attached to a but-3-enal chain, with a hydroxyl group on the benzene ring.

**Answer: D**
