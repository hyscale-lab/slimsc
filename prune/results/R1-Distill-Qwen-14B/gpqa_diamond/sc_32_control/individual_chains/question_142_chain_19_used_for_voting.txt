Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. So, the question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed, not in a pure state.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I think this looks familiar. If I expand this, it's a diagonal matrix because |0⟩ and |1⟩ are orthogonal. Let me write that out. The |0⟩⟨0| part is a matrix with 1 at (1,1) and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 at (2,2). So when I add them together and multiply by 1/2, each diagonal element becomes 1/2, right? So ρ would be a 2x2 diagonal matrix with entries [0.5, 0; 0, 0.5]. That makes sense because it's a completely mixed state, like a classical coin toss between |0⟩ and |1⟩.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position. I'm a bit fuzzy on how density matrices are represented geometrically. Oh wait, I think it's related to the Bloch sphere. Pure states are on the surface of the Bloch sphere, while mixed states are inside. But how exactly does the density matrix correspond to a point in this space?

The Bloch sphere representation for a qubit is such that any state can be written as a vector r in 3D space, and the density matrix is (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. Right, so for a density matrix ρ, we can express it as (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2.

Wait, but I have to find r, the vector (r_x, r_y, r_z). Let's see. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let's write this out in terms of the Pauli matrices. The identity matrix I is 2x2 with ones on the diagonal. So |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is I. So ρ = (I)/2.

Hmm, so putting that into the Bloch sphere formula: ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. Wait, that would mean that (I/2) = (I + r·σ)/2. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get I = I + r·σ. Subtract I from both sides: 0 = r·σ. That implies that all components of r must be zero. Because if you have r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z = 0, the only solution is r_x = r_y = r_z =0.

Wait, but that can't be right because if r is all zeros, the state would be the completely mixed state, which matches ρ. Because when r is zero, the density matrix is (I + 0)/2 = I/2. So yes, that's exactly what we have here. So the vector r is (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be option C.

Wait, let me double-check. For a pure state, like |0⟩, the density matrix is |0⟩⟨0|, which would correspond to r=(1,0,0). For |1⟩, it's (0,0,1), right? Because the vector is (x,y,z) where x^2 + y^2 + z^2 =1. But in this case, the state is a completely mixed state, which is in the center of the Bloch sphere, so the position is at the origin. That makes sense. So yeah, the r vector is (0,0,0), option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This is a diagonal matrix with entries \([0.5, 0; 0, 0.5]\), representing a completely mixed state. In the Bloch sphere representation, any qubit state can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is a vector in 3D space, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices. For the given \(\rho\), we have:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

Equating this to the Bloch sphere formula:

\[
\frac{I}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right).
\]

Subtracting \(I/2\) from both sides gives:

\[
\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0.
\]

This implies that all components of \(\mathbf{r}\) must be zero (\(r_x = r_y = r_z = 0\)), meaning the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. This corresponds to the completely mixed state. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).**
