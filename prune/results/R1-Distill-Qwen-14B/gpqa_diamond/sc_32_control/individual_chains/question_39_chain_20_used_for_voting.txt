Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of wave functions and probabilities. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that can move along a tube (the x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, right, wave functions are supposed to be complex, so the presence of i (the imaginary unit) makes sense.

The key point is that when they measured the particles' positions, none were found outside the region x=1 to x=3. So the probability of finding the particle is zero outside this interval. That must mean that the wave function is zero outside x=1 and x=3, right? Or wait, no, wait. The wave function being zero doesn't necessarily mean the probability is zero because it's the square of the absolute value that gives the probability density. So maybe the wave function isn't zero, but the probability is zero outside 1 and 3. Oh, wait, no, if the particle isn't found outside 1 and 3, then the wave function must be zero outside that region because otherwise, there would be a non-zero probability.

Wait, no, that's not necessarily correct. Because sometimes wave functions don't go to zero but are non-zero, but the probability could be zero if the wave function is zero in that region. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem states that when they measured, none were found at x <1 and x>3. So that means the probability of finding the particle in those regions is zero. So the probability density must be zero outside x=1 and x=3. The probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So for x <1 and x>3, |ψ(x)|² = 0. That implies that ψ(x) must be zero in those regions, because any non-zero ψ would result in a non-zero probability.

So the wave function must be zero outside x=1 and x=3. But wait, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me note that the wave function is a function of x, so perhaps it's valid in the region between 1 and 3, and zero outside. But the given expression doesn't include that. So I must consider that the given wave function is only valid for x between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. Hmm, but the problem says each system's wave function is as given, but measurements found particles only between 1 and 3. So perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3.

Wait, but the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That's a complex function. So for x between 1 and 3, the wave function is that, and elsewhere it's zero. Because otherwise, the probability wouldn't be zero outside that region.

So, the wave function is:

ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) − 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤3,

and ψ(x) = 0 otherwise.

But wait, the problem says the wave function in the part where it can exist is as given. So perhaps the given expression is correct only within x from 1 to 3, and zero outside.

Now, the next step is to normalize this wave function. Because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1 (or 100%, because it's certain to be found somewhere). So the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 should be equal to 1.

Let me compute |ψ(x)|². Since ψ(x) is a complex number, the square of its absolute value is the product of ψ and its complex conjugate.

The complex conjugate of ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i.

So |ψ(x)|² = [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) ]^2 + (0.5)^2, because when you multiply (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i) by (a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i), you get (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

Wait, yeah, because (a + ib)(a - ib) = a² + b². So here, a is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and b is 0.5.

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait wait, wait. Let me recheck:

ψ(x) = A + iB, where A = a/sqrt(1+x), B = -0.5.

The complex conjugate is A - iB, so ψ*(x) = A + i*0.5.

Then ψψ* = (A)^2 + (B)^2, because A^2 + (AB*) where AB* would cross terms, but wait: (A +iB)(A -iB) = A² + iB A - iA B - (iB)(iB) )= A^2 + B^2 because the cross terms cancel (i*i = -1, so (iB)(-iB)= B^2).

Wait, wait, no: (iB)(-iB) = -i² B² = -( -1 ) B² = B^2. So yes, the cross terms would be A*(iB) + (-iB)*A) = i AB -i AB = 0. So only A² and B² remain.

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me compute that integral.

Breaking it into two parts:

Integral [a²/(1+x)] dx from 1 to3  + Integral [0.25] dx from 1 to3.

The first integral: a^2 ∫ 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first integral is a² * ln(2).

The second integral: 0.25 * (3-1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

So total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So:

a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849. Hmm, looking at the options, B is 0.85, which is close. So the answer would be option B.

Wait, but wait: let me double-check the setup.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But when I computed the integral, I considered the wave function to be zero outside. So the given wave function applies only between x=1 and x=3. So the setup is correct.

Wait another thing: perhaps the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, and that applies only in the region where the particle exists (x between 1 and3). So normalization is done over that interval, which I did.

Thus, the calculation seems correct. So a is approximately 0.85, which is option B.

To determine the value of \(a\), we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \quad \text{for } 1 \leq x \leq 3,
\]

and \(\psi(x) = 0\) outside this region. The problem states that no particles were found outside \(x = 1\) and \(x = 3\), meaning the probability density \(|\psi(x)|^2\) must be zero outside this interval. This implies that the wave function is non-zero only between \(x = 1\) and \(x = 3\).

The probability density is given by:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

To normalize the wave function, the total probability over the interval \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\) must equal 1:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \(|\psi(x)|^2\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

Breaking this into two parts:

1. **First term**: \(\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx\)

   The integral of \(\frac{1}{1+x}\) is \(\ln(1+x)\). Evaluating this from \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\):

   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_{1}^{3} = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second term**: \(\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx\)

   This is straightforward:

   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
   \]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5,
\]

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213,
\]

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

The closest option to this value is \(0.85\), which corresponds to **Option B**.
