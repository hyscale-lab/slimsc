Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about two reactions involving different reducing agents and determining the starting materials. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but let's see.

The problem says that a chemist used two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one respectively. Wait, no, actually, looking again, the first reaction gives (R) and the second gives (S) products. Or wait, no, the first reaction is A treated with LiBH4 and H+ giving (R), and B treated with BH3 and H+ giving (S). Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, the way the question is written, the first reaction produces (R), the second (S). So, two different conditions leading to enantiomers.

Wait, the product is a ketone. Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is a cyclic ketone, right? So it's a six-membered ring with an oxygen. So, pyran is similar to pyrone, but in this case, it's a tetrahydro, meaning that it's a partially hydrogenated version. So, the structure would be a cyclic ether with a ketone group.

The products are (R) and (S) configurations. So this suggests that the product is a chiral molecule, and the stereochemistry depends on the starting material and the reaction conditions.

Looking at the reagents: LiBH4 and BH3. Wait, I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce carbonyl groups. BH3 is also a reducing agent, but I think it's usually used in specific conditions, like in hydroboration reactions, but wait, wait. Oh, wait, no. LiBH4 is more for ketones and aldehydes, but BH3 is often used in the reduction of esters or perhaps in certain stereoselective reductions.

Wait, no, another thought: when you reduce a ketone with LiBH4, you get a secondary alcohol. But wait, the product here is a ketone, not an alcohol. That's confusing. Wait, no. Wait, maybe the starting material isn't a ketone. Oh! Maybe the starting material is a carbonyl that, upon reduction, becomes a diol or another structure.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone. So maybe the starting material was a cyclic ester or something else that upon reduction forms a ketone. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and when treated with a reducing agent, it forms a diol, which cyclizes to form a ketone. Wait, that might not make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a hemiacetal or an acetal. Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone. Let me think about the reactions.

Wait, okay, another approach. Let's consider that the product is a cyclic ketone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the structure would be a six-membered ring with oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4. The configuration is R or S, so the ring has a stereogenic center.

How does a cyclic ketone form from a starting material? Maybe through an intramolecular hemiacetal formation after the reduction. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal or something that upon reduction forms the ring.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a ketone with a protecting group. Wait, no, that might not fit.

Alternatively, the starting material might be a cyclic ester. Wait, esters can be reduced, but with which reagent? Let me think: LiBH4 typically reduces esters to alcohols, but perhaps under certain conditions, like in the presence of something else.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the starting materials are cyclic acetals, and when they are treated with a reducing agent, they undergo ring-opening followed by some reaction. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a ketone with an adjacent ester or another functional group. Hmm, not quite.

Wait, maybe it's about the stereochemistry of the reduction. So, when you reduce a ketone, you get an alcohol. But in this case, the product is a ketone. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, and upon treatment with an acid, it forms the ketone. But the reagents here are LiBH4 and H+.

Wait, maybe I should think about the other part: the starting materials A and B are given as options in the choices. Oh, right, the options show that A and B are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, with (R) or (S) configurations.

Wait, wait, so the starting materials are pentanoic acid derivatives. Let me look at the options.

Option A says A is (S) and B is (S). Option C has A as S and B as R, etc.

So both A and B are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, but their configurations are R or S.

So, the starting material is a pentanoic acid with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Let me imagine the structure.

Pentanoic acid: CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but in this case, it's substituted.

The structure would be:

At position 3 (the third carbon from the COOH), there's an ethyl group. At position 5 (the fifth carbon, which is the COOH carbon?), wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH, so the carbons are 1 (COOH), 2, 3, 4, 5 (the methyl end). So 3-ethyl would be on the third carbon. 5-isobutoxy would be on the fifth carbon, which is the end CH2. But 5-oxo would be the carbonyl on the fifth carbon, but wait, that's the COOH group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is: 5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the structure would be something like:

O=C-O-R is at the end, which is the 5th position, and the COOH is at the first. Wait, but that would make the acid group on C1, and the oxo on C5? That seems a bit far.

Wait, 5-oxopentanoic acid would be: CH2(COOR)CH2CH2COOH? No, maybe not. Wait, perhaps it's:

The structure is:

COOH - CH2 - CH(CH2CH2CH3) - OCH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, wait, the compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Hmm. So pentanoic acid is:

COOH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait, pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH, so it's 5 carbons, with COOH on the first carbon.

So, 3-ethyl would be on the third carbon. So the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2- ?

Wait, but wait, the 5th carbon is the end. So 5-isobutoxy would be attached to the fifth carbon. So, the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-OCH(CH2CH3)2 ?

But wait, 5-oxo would mean a ketone group on carbon 5. But wait, carbon 5 in pentanoic acid is the end, so making it a ketone would mean it's a five-carbon chain with a ketone at the end.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH - CH2 - CH(CH2CH2CH3) - C(O) - OCH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's 5-oxo, meaning the fifth carbon is a carbonyl group. So, structure: O=C-O-R (the fifth position) connected to the rest.

Wait, perhaps the actual structure is a cyclic ester. Or perhaps it's an ester group. Alternatively, maybe it's a keto group.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are esters. Let me think. The product is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting material is an ester that, upon reduction, forms a diol, which then forms the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal, and the reducing agents open them up. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone with a neighboring ester group, and the reduction leads to a ring formation.

Wait, another approach: the product is a six-membered ring with a ketone. So, perhaps the starting material is a diol with a ketone group that cyclizes upon reduction.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the key here is to think about the reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. Wait, but LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. LiBH4 typically reduces esters to alcohols, while BH3 might not. Or wait, no, BH3 is usually used in hydroboration reactions, which are used for the addition to alkenes, but in some cases, BH3 can be used for reductions of esters, though under specific conditions.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the possible reaction mechanisms.

The products are cyclic ketones. So, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones), and when reduced, they lose the ester group and form a diol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the ketone. Wait, that might not make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal of a ketone. When treated with a reducing agent, the acetal is opened, and the ketone is formed. But that doesn't fit with the product being a cyclic ketone.

Wait, another thought: When a cyclic ketone is formed via reduction, perhaps the starting material is a ketone itself with a leaving group that, upon reduction, forms a ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an aldehyde. But then, reducing an aldehyde would give a primary alcohol, which doesn't form a cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. When the ester is reduced, it becomes a diol. Then, the diol could undergo an acid-catalyzed cyclization to form a cyclic ketone.

Wait, that might make sense. Let's think: a lactone (cyclic ester) would have an oxygen in the ring. When you reduce it with a strong reducing agent like LiBH4, the ester group would be reduced to a diol. Then, under acidic conditions (H+), the diol could undergo cyclization to form a cyclic ketone.

Wait, but how? Let me think about that. So, if you have a five-membered lactone, for example, and you reduce it to a diol, you'd have two adjacent OH groups. Then, under acid, the diol could lose water and form an ether linkage, but that wouldn't form a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material isn't a lactone but a different structure. Maybe it's a gamma or delta lactone, and upon reduction, the ring opens to form a diol, which then cyclizes.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should focus on the stereochemistry aspect.

The product is (R) or (S) depending on which reagent is used. So the configuration of the starting material and the type of reducing agent will determine the configuration of the product.

Wait, so reducing agents can influence the stereochemistry of a reaction. For example, in the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols, the stereochemistry is determined by the approach of the hydride. If the reducing agent is chiral, it can induce a specific configuration.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a ketone, so the starting material must be a different functional group. Wait, that's confusing because I'm getting a ketone from a reduction, which usually would produce an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester. Let me think: when an ester is reduced, it becomes a primary alcohol. Wait, but that doesn't lead to a ketone.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal. When treated with a reducing agent, the hemiacetal opens, and then perhaps the molecule cyclizes again under the reaction conditions to form a ketone.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal of a ketone. When the acetal is reduced, the ketone is regenerated.

Wait, but that doesn't explain the formation of a cyclic structure.

Wait, perhaps the products are formed via a different mechanism. Let's think about the products being 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That structure has a six-membered ring, so perhaps the starting material has a chain that can form a six-membered ring upon reduction and cyclization.

Let me think about the structure of the product. The cyclic ketone is at position 2, and there's an ethyl group at position 4. So, perhaps the starting material has an ethyl group in such a position that upon reduction and cyclization, it ends up at position 4.

Wait, but I'm not making much progress with this approach. Maybe I should think about the starting materials as given in the options. All the options are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, with R or S configurations.

So, the structure is a pentanoic acid with an ethyl group on C3 and an isobutoxy group attached to C5, which is also a ketone (5-oxo).

So, the structure would be: COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O)-OCH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, maybe not. Let me try to draw it.

The molecule is pentanoic acid, so the chain is:

Carboxylic acid (C1) - CH2 (C2) - CH(CH2CH2CH3) (C3) - C(O) (C4) - OCH(CH2CH3)2 (C5)?

Wait, that doesn't seem right because that would give six carbons in the chain. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

C1: COOH
C2: CH2
C3: CH(CH2CH2CH3)
C4: C(O)
C5: OCH(CH2CH3)2

Wait, but that would make the molecule have five carbons: COOH, CH2, CH(CH2CH2CH3), C(O), and then the isobutoxy. Hmm, perhaps it's a five-carbon chain with substituents.

In any case, the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative with a ketone and an ether group.

So, when treated with a reducing agent, what happens? Let's think about LiBH4 and BH3. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce esters and ketones to their corresponding alcohols. BH3, on the other hand, is used in hydroboration reactions, but when used with other conditions, like in THF or with certain catalysts, it can reduce esters to alcohols as well, but perhaps with different selectivity.

Wait, but the starting material here isn't an ester, it's an acid. So, perhaps the LiBH4 would reduce the acid to a primary alcohol. But wait, I thought LiBH4 doesn't typically reduce carboxylic acids. They usually require stronger reducing agents like LiAlH4 to reduce carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. But LiBH4 can reduce esters to alcohols.

Wait, that's an important point. So, if the starting material is a pentanoic acid with an ester group (like the isobutoxy), but I'm not sure.

Wait, the starting material is 5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, at position 5, there's an isobutoxy group and a ketone (oxo) group.

Hmm. So, the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O)-OCH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, perhaps that's the structure. So, the molecule is a pentanoic acid (five carbons) but with substituents on C3 and C5.

So, when this molecule is treated with a reducing agent, what happens? Let's think about the functional groups present. There's a ketone (5-oxo) and an ester group (5-isobutoxy).

Wait, the 5-oxo is a ketone, and the 5-isobutoxy is an ether. So, perhaps the ketone is the reactive group here.

When a ketone is reduced with LiBH4, it becomes a secondary alcohol. But in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone. So, that doesn't seem to fit. Wait, unless the starting material undergoes a ring-forming reaction upon reduction.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an alpha-keto ester. So, when reduced, it could form a gamma-hydroxy ester, which could undergo cyclization to form a cyclic ketone.

Wait, so the starting material is an alpha-keto ester: RCO-COOR'. Upon reduction, the ketone (alpha) is reduced to an alcohol, leading to RCH(OH)-COOR'. Then, perhaps under acidic conditions, the -OH and -OR' groups could lead to cyclization, forming a cyclic ketone.

Wait, that could make sense. So, in this case, the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, and upon reduction, it forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, another approach: the product is a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal. But no, the product is a cyclic ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product forms via a keto-enol tautomerism or some kind of cyclization after the reduction.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a diketone, and upon reduction, it forms a diol which then cyclizes.

Perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the stereochemistry part. The starting materials are either R or S, and the products are R and S, respectively.

Reduction reactions can affect the stereochemistry of the product. For example, in the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, the configuration at the chiral center is determined by the reducing agent and the approach of the hydride.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a hemiacetal, and the reduction leads to the opening of the hemiacetal, forming a diol, which then cyclizes into the ketone.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the reaction conditions.

The first reaction uses LiBH4 and H+. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces esters to alcohols, ketones to secondary alcohols, etc.

The second reaction uses BH3 and H+. Wait, BH3 is a Lewis acid and is commonly used in hydroboration reactions, but in some cases, it can be used to reduce esters or ketones. However, I'm not entirely sure about the specifics.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester. Let's imagine that. If the starting material is an ester, then treatment with LiBH4 would reduce it to a primary alcohol. Then, with acid, perhaps the molecule could cyclize to form a cyclic ketone.

Wait, but I'm not quite getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), which upon reduction with LiBH4 would form a diol. Then, under acidic conditions, the diol would cyclize to form a cyclic ketone.

Wait, that could be it. Let's think about that.

So, a five-membered lactone (cyclic ester) would, upon reduction with LiBH4, open to form a diol. Then, under H+, the diol might lose water to form a cyclic ether (like an epoxide), but that's not a ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction of the lactone yields a diol that can undergo acid-catalyzed cyclization to form a cyclic ketone.

Wait, but how? Let me think about the mechanism. Suppose the lactone is a six-membered ring. Upon reduction, it becomes a diol. Then, perhaps the diol can lose a molecule of water to form a five-membered ring, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the diol undergoes keto-enol tautomerism and forms a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the key here is the configuration of the starting material and the product.

Looking at the options, each option pairs A and B as either both R, both S, or one R and one S.

The product from A is (R), and the product from B is (S). So the starting materials must have opposite configurations, perhaps.

Wait, that suggests that when using different reducing agents, the configuration of the product changes.

Wait, so the starting material's configuration and the reducing agent's ability to affect the approach of the hydride would determine the product's configuration.

Wait, in the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, the configuration of the resulting alcohol depends on the approach of the hydride. If the starting ketone is chiral, the reducing agent can influence the configuration of the resulting alcohol.

Wait, but in this problem, the product is a ketone, not an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an aldehyde. But that doesn't seem to fit.

Hmm. Maybe I should think in terms of the Woodward-Hoffmann rules or something related to the stereochemistry of reductions.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think again.

The products are enantiomers, R and S. So, the reaction conditions must be causing the inversion of configuration.

Wait, but when you reduce a ketone to an alcohol, the configuration of the resulting alcohol is determined by the reducing conditions. For example, when using a chiral reducing agent, you can get a specific configuration.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a chiral reducing agent? No, no. LiBH4 is not chiral. Wait, but the starting material is chiral, so the configuration of the product would depend on the starting material's configuration and the type of reducing agent.

Wait, wait. Let me think. If the starting material is a ketone, and it's chiral, when you reduce it to an alcohol, the configuration will depend on whether the hydride attacks from the same face (leading to retention) or opposite face (leading to inversion). But since LiBH4 is not a chiral agent, perhaps the attack is not stereoselective, leading to a racemic mixture. But the product here is a single enantiomer, which suggests that the reduction is stereoselective.

Hmm, but I might be getting into deeper waters here than I can handle.

An alternative approach is to consider the options and think about which starting materials would lead to R and S products with the given reagents.

The options are:

A) Both A and B are (S)
B) Both A and B are (R)
C) A is (S), B is (R)
D) A is (R), B is (S)

So, the first reaction uses LiBH4 and H+ and gives (R). The second uses BH3 and H+ and gives (S). So, the starting materials (A and B) must be such that when each is treated with their respective reagent, the product is R and S, respectively.

Wait, but the starting materials in the options are either R or S, but the same or different for A and B.

So, if A is (R) and B is (S), or vice versa, the product would change based on the reagent.

Wait, but how does the configuration of the starting material affect the product's configuration when reduced?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and when treated with LiBH4, it reduces to a diol, which then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone with a specific configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone itself, but that doesn't fit because the product is a cyclic ketone.

Wait, perhaps the ketone in the product is formed via a ring-closing reaction after the reduction.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a malonic ester or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal. When reduced, it forms a diol, which then under acid, forms the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think about the possible steps again.

The starting material is a 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, it's a pentanoic acid with substituents on C3 and C5.

When treated with LiBH4 and H+, it becomes (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Similarly, when treated with BH3 and H+, it becomes (S) of the same structure.

So, the reaction must be reducing some functional group in the starting material to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has an ester group which is being reduced to form a diol, which then cyclizes.

Wait, but the starting material is a pentanoic acid with an isobutoxy group. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is a cyclic ester, which upon reduction opens into a diol, which then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, the starting material is a gamma-lactone (five-membered ring), which upon reduction with LiBH4 opens to form a diol. Then, under acid, the diol cyclizes to form the six-membered cyclic ketone.

So, let's imagine that. The gamma-lactone would have four carbons in the ring (since gamma is four atoms away from the ester oxygen). Upon reduction, the ester becomes a diol. Then, when acid is added, the diol undergoes cyclization to form a five-membered ring. But wait, the product is a six-membered ring, so maybe it's a delta-lactone (five-membered ring) that opens to a diol which cyclizes to form a six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a delta-lactone (five-membered), which upon reduction gives a diol with a chain that can form a six-membered ring upon cyclization.

So, perhaps the structure of the starting material is a five-membered lactone, which upon reduction to a diol, becomes a chain that can form a six-membered ring (pyran) with a ketone.

Wait, but how does the diol form the pyran? The diol would have two OH groups, which under acid, can undergo elimination to form an ether. But without a leaving group, that might not happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol can undergo an acid-catalyzed cyclization with the formation of a new oxygen ring.

Wait, perhaps the diol has a hydroxyl group that can attack a carbonyl carbon, leading to ring formation.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the product structure again. The product is 4-ethyl-2-pyranone. So, in the ring, the substituents are at positions 2 (the ketone) and 4 (ethyl).

So, the six-membered ring has O at position 1, ketone at 2, and ethyl at 4.

So, perhaps the starting material is a diol with hydroxyl groups positioned in such a way that upon cyclization, they form the ring with the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the pentanoic acid derivative, upon reduction, forms a diol that can form the ring.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but maybe I can think about the configurations.

Suppose the starting material is (R) configuration. When it's treated with LiBH4, which is a stronger reducing agent, perhaps it forms a specific product configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the stereochemistry of the starting material and the reducing agent's conditions lead to the specific R or S configuration in the product.

In the options, some have A and B as R and S, others have both R or both S.

Assuming that the same starting material with different reducing agents would lead to different configurations, then A and B must be in different configurations.

Looking at the options, option D has A as R and B as S. So when A is treated with LiBH4, it gives R, and when B (S) is treated with BH3, it gives S.

Alternatively, perhaps the reducing agent affects the configuration based on the approach of the hydride. If LiBH4 induces a certain facial attack, leading to R, while BH3 induces the opposite, leading to S.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure how that would work. Maybe the key is that the same starting material, when reduced with different agents, gives different configurations. But in our problem, A and B are different starting materials.

Wait, perhaps when the starting materials are enantiomers, the products are also enantiomers when reduced with different reagents.

Wait, but that's just a guess. So, if A is R and B is S, then using LiBH4 and BH3 would yield R and S products, respectively.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material dictates the configuration of the product, and the type of reducing agent (LiBH4 vs BH3) doesn't affect the configuration, but only the starting material's configuration does.

In that case, if A is R and B is S, then using LiBH4 on A would give R, and BH3 on B would give S. So the correct option would be D.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the product depends on both the starting material and the reducing agent.

But without knowing the exact mechanism, I have to make an educated guess.

The options are:

A) Both A and B are (S)
B) Both are (R)
C) A is (S), B is (R)
D) A is (R), B is (S)

The products are (R) and (S) respectively. So, if A is (R) and treated with LiBH4, gives (R). If B is (S) and treated with BH3, gives (S). So option D would make sense, where A and B are enantiomers, leading to enantiomeric products.

So, the answer should be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the starting materials for two reactions that yield enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reactions use different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The key is to analyze the stereochemistry of the starting materials and how the reducing agents influence the product configurations.

The product is a six-membered cyclic ketone with a stereogenic center at position 4, giving rise to the (R) and (S) enantiomers. The starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid derivatives, differing in their configurations (R or S). The stereochemistry of the product depends on both the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent used.

LiBH4 and BH3 are known to reduce carbonyl groups to alcohols, but their stereochemical outcomes can differ based on the approach of the hydride. The starting materials must be enantiomers (R and S) to produce the enantiomeric products. If A is (R) and treated with LiBH4, it produces (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Similarly, if B is (S) and treated with BH3, it produces (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This pairing ensures that the stereochemistry of the starting materials aligns with the stereochemistry of the products.

Among the options, only option D satisfies this condition, where A is (R) and B is (S). This ensures that the two reactions yield the correct enantiomeric products based on the reducing agents used.

Answer: D
