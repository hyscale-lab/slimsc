Okay, so I've got this problem here about scattering electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I remember that scattering amplitude in physics often involves some kind of phase shifts. The question gives me some phase shifts: δ₀ is 90 degrees, δ₁ is 67, δ₂ is 55, δ₃ is 30, and δ₄ is 13 degrees. They say to ignore the rest, so I guess I only consider these five.

The question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh right, I think the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) has a certain expression involving those phase shifts. I'm a bit rusty, but I remember something about partial waves and the amplitude being a sum over Legendre polynomials multiplied by some exponential terms involving the phase shifts.

Wait, the formula for the scattering amplitude f is given by f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) exp(iδ_l - i l φ) P_l(cosθ), right? But wait, that's when considering all the partial waves. But the problem is asking specifically along the incident beam direction, which is when θ = 0 degrees. Because along the beam, the scattering angle is zero.

So, when θ is zero, cosθ is 1, and the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for all l, right? Because P_l(1) is just 1. So the sum simplifies because each P_l is 1, so the amplitude becomes (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) exp(iδ_l) exp(-i l φ).

But wait, the problem says along the incident beam direction, so I think that means φ=0 as well. Because the beam is along the z-axis, so any scattering would be around that. So φ=0, so exp(-i l φ) becomes 1 as well. So the amplitude f becomes (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) exp(iδ_l).

But wait, the imaginary part of f. So I need to compute the imaginary part of this sum, then multiply by the factor 1/(2ik). Wait, but k here is the wave number. Oh, right, because we're dealing with electrons, the wave number k can be found from their energy.

The energy is given as 50 MeV. Hmm, I need to find k. The energy of an electron is related to its momentum by E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ). But since the energy is much larger than the rest mass (mc² for electron is about 0.511 MeV), we can approximate E ≈ pc. So p ≈ E/c. So k = p/(ħ) = (E/(ħc)) * (1/c) ? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the wave number k is given by k = p/ħ. Oh, right, because p = ħk. So E = sqrt( (ħkc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ), but for high energies, E ≈ ħkc. So k ≈ E/(ħc). But I need to compute this correctly.

The electron's rest mass energy is 0.511 MeV. But 50 MeV is much larger, so the approximation E ≈ pc is valid. So p = E/c. So k = p/(ħ) = (E/(c ħ)).

But I need to calculate this in units that work out. Let's see, what are the units for k? It's 1/fm, because fm is 1e-15 meters. And I remember that ħc is approximately 197.33 MeV fm. Oh yeah, because ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. So E is 50 MeV, so k = E/(ħc) = 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So 1/(2ik) would be 1/(2i * 0.253) ≈ 1/(0.506 i) ≈ -1.976 i. Because 1/i = -i.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 2ik is 2i*(50)/(197.33) → 100/(197.33) ≈ 0.506 i. So 1/(2ik) is 1/(0.506 i) = (1/0.506) * (1/i) → approximately 1.976 * (-i) = -1.976i.

But for now, I'll keep it as 1/(2ik) multiplied by the sum.

Now, the sum is over l=0 to l=4 (since higher l are ignored). Each term is (2l+1) exp(i δ_l). For each l, we have a phase shift δ_l. So let's compute each term.

l=0: (2*0+1)=1, δ₀=90 degrees = π/2 radians. exp(i π/2) is i. So term is 1 * i = i.

l=1: 2l+1=3, δ₁=67 degrees. 67 * π/180 ≈ 1.169 radians. exp(i 1.169) ≈ cos(1.169) + i sin(1.169). Let me calculate cos(67°) ≈ 0.3907, sin(67) ≈ 0.9205. So approx 0.3907 + i 0.9205.

Multiply by 3: 3*(0.3907 + i 0.9205) ≈ 1.1721 + i 2.7615.

l=2: 2l+1=5, δ₂=55 degrees. 55 * π/180 ≈ 0.9599 radians. cos(55)= ~0.5736, sin(55)= ~0.8192. So exp(i 0.9599) ≈ 0.5736 + i 0.8192. Multiply by 5: 2.868 + i 4.096.

l=3: 2l+1=7, δ=30 degrees. 30 degrees is π/6, about 0.5236 rad. cos(30)=√3/2 ≈0.8660, sin(30)=0.5. So exp(i 0.5236)= ~0.8660 + i 0.5. Multiply by 7: 6.062 + i 3.5.

l=4: 2l+1=9, δ=13 degrees. 13 * π/180 ≈ 0.2269 rad. cos(13)= ~0.9744, sin(13) ≈ 0.2249. So exp(i 0.2269)= 0.9744 + i 0.2249. Multiply by 9: 8.770 + i 2.024.

Now, sum all these terms. Let's add the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.

Real parts:

l=0: 1 * 1 (since exp(i 90) is 0 real part? Wait, wait. Wait, no. For l=0, the term is (2l+1) exp(i δ_l), which is 1 * exp(i 90). So exp(i 90) is i, which has real part 0 and imaginary part 1. So real part is 0.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because the term is (2l+1) exp(i δ_l). For l=0, it's 1 * exp(i 90) = i. So real part is 0, imaginary is 1. So when I sum, the real parts are from l=1 to l=4.

Wait, I think I should recalculate each term correctly:

Wait, no. Let me correct that. For each term (2l+1) exp(i δ_l), I need to find the real and imaginary parts.

Let me recast all terms:

l=0: (2l+1)=1, δ=90°, which is π/2 radians.

exp(i * π/2) = cos(π/2) + i sin(π/2) = 0 + i*1 → real part 0, imaginary part 1.

So term is (1)*(0 + i1) = 0 + i1.

l=1: 3 * [ cos(67°) + i sin(67°) ] → 3*(0.3907 + i 0.9205) = 1.1721 + i 2.7615.

l=2:5 * [ cos(55) + i sin(55) ] →5*(0.5736 + i 0.8192)=2.868 + i4.096.

l=3:7 * [cos(30) + i sin(30) ] →7*(0.8660 + i 0.5)=6.062 + i3.5.

l=4:9 * [cos(13) + i sin(13) ] →9*(0.9744 + i 0.2249)=8.770 + i 2.024.

Now, sum all terms. Let's separate real and imaginary parts.

Real parts:

l=0: 0

l=1:1.1721

l=2:2.868

l=3:6.062

l=4:8.770

Sum of real parts: 0 + 1.1721 + 2.868 + 6.062 +8.770 = let's compute:

1.1721 + 2.868 = 4.0401

4.0401 +6.062= 10.1021

10.1021 +8.770=18.8721.

Imaginary parts:

l=0:1

l=1:2.7615

l=2:4.096

l=3:3.5

l=4:2.024

Sum of imaginary parts: 1 +2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.024=13.3815.

So the sum is (18.8721) + i (13.3815).

But wait, the amplitude f is (1/(2ik)) multiplied by this sum. So f = (sum) * (1/(2ik)).

But 1/(2ik) is (1/(2i)) * (1/k). And k is 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm) ) → k ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So 1/(2ik) = (1/(2i)) * (1/0.253) ≈ (1/(2i)) * 3.952 ≈ (3.952)/(2i) → 1.976 / i → which is -1.976i (since 1/i = -i).

Wait, let me compute 1/(2ik) more accurately. k=50/(197.33) ≈0.25304 fm⁻¹.

So 2ik = 2i * 0.25304 → 0.50608 i.

So 1/(2ik) = 1/(0.50608 i ) → multiply numerator and denominator by -i: (1*(-i)) / (0.50608 * (-i^2)) ) → (-i)/(0.50608 * 1) ) → (-i)/0.50608 ≈ -1.976i.

So then f becomes sum * (-1.976i).

So f = (18.8721 + i 13.3815) * (-1.976i).

Let me compute this.

Multiply each part:

18.8721 * (-1.976i) → -18.8721 *1.976 i ≈ -37.35 i.

i*13.3815 * (-1.976i) → 13.3815 * (-1.976) * i^2 → since i^2=-1.

So 13.3815 * (-1.976) = approx -26.51. Multiply by -1 → 26.51.

So adding both parts: 26.51 -37.35 i.

Wait, wait no. Let me do it step by step.

The multiplication is:

( a + ib ) * ( c + id ) where c is real and d is imaginary. Wait, no, in this case, the multiplier is (-1.976i), which is 0 + (-1.976i).

So (a + ib) * (0 -1.976i) → a*(0) + a*(-1.976i) + ib*(0) + ib*(-1.976i).

Which is: 0 -1.976 a i +0 + (-1.976 i^2 b).

i^2 is -1, so this becomes -1.976 a i + 1.976 b.

So real part is 1.976 b, and imaginary part is -1.976 a.

In our case, a is 18.8721, b is 13.3815.

So real part: 1.976 * 13.3815 ≈ 26.51.

Imaginary part: -1.976 * 18.8721 ≈ -37.35.

So f ≈ 26.51 -37.35 i.

But wait, the problem asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So Im(f) is -37.35. But since the options are positive, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation somewhere. Let's double-check the steps.

Wait, the sum of the terms is 18.8721 + i13.3815. Then multiplied by 1/(2ik) = -1.976i.

So (18.8721 + i13.3815) * (-1.976i) → let me compute each term.

First, 18.8721 * (-1.976i) is (18.8721 * -1.976 ) i → which is approximately -37.35 i.

Then, i13.3815 * (-1.976i) = 13.3815 * (-1.976) * (i^2) → since i^2=-1, this becomes 13.3815 * (-1.976) * (-1) → 13.3815 *1.976 ≈ 26.51.

So adding both terms: 26.51 -37.35i.

Wait, but the imaginary part of f is -37.35. But the options are positive. Maybe the actual formula includes a negative sign somewhere else.

Wait, the formula for f is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) exp(iδ_l) P_l(cosθ) exp(-i l φ). But I think I might have missed a (-1)^l factor. Because sometimes the phase shifts are defined with an (-1)^l factor in the exponential.

Wait, right, I think the correct expression is f(θ,φ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ (-1)^l exp(iδ_l) ] P_l(cosθ) exp(-i l φ).

Ah! I forgot the (-1)^l term. That changes everything.

So the correct term for each l is (2l+1) * (-1)^l * exp(i δ_l).

So I need to recalculate each term with (-1)^l.

Let's redo each term with this correction.

l=0: (-1)^0 = 1.

So term is 1 * exp(i90°) = 0 + i1.

l=1: (-1)^1 = -1.

So term is 3 * (-1) * [cos(67) + i sin(67)] → 3*(-0.3907 - i 0.9205) → -1.1721 - i 2.7615.

l=2: (-1)^2=1.

Term is 5 * [0.5736 + i 0.8192 ] → 2.868 + i4.096.

l=3: (-1)^3 = -1.

Term is 7 * (-1) [0.8660 + i 0.5] → -6.062 - i3.5.

l=4: (-1)^4=1.

Term is 9 * [0.9744 + i0.2249] →8.770 + i2.024.

Now, let's sum real and imaginary parts again.

Real parts:

l=0: 0

l=1: -1.1721

l=2:2.868

l=3:-6.062

l=4:8.770

Sum_real = 0 -1.1721 +2.868 -6.062 +8.770.

Compute step by step:

0 -1.1721 = -1.1721

-1.1721 +2.868 → 1.6959

1.6959 -6.062 → -4.3661

-4.3661 +8.770 →4.4039.

Imaginary parts:

l=0: 1.

l=1: -2.7615.

l=2:4.096.

l=3:-3.5.

l=4:2.024.

Sum_imag=1 -2.7615 +4.096 -3.5 +2.024.

Compute:

1 -2.7615 = -1.7615

-1.7615 +4.096 =2.3345

2.3345 -3.5 =-1.1655

-1.1655 +2.024=0.8585.

So the sum is 4.4039 + i 0.8585.

Now, multiply this by 1/(2ik) = -1.976i.

So f = (4.4039 + i 0.8585) * (-1.976i).

Let's compute this.

First, 4.4039 * (-1.976i) → approximately (4.4039 * (-1.976 )) i → 4.4039 * (-1.976) ≈ -8.706 i.

Second term: i 0.8585 * (-1.976 i ) → 0.8585 * (-1.976) * i^2 → 0.8585 * (-1.976) * (-1) → 0.8585 *1.976 ≈ 1.706.

So combining the two parts:

1.706 -8.706 i.

So the amplitude f is approximately 1.706 -8.706i.

So the imaginary part Im(f) is -8.706, but since the problem asks for the imaginary part, which is a value, perhaps the magnitude is considered? Or perhaps I made a sign error somewhere.

Wait, the problem states "the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction." So the imaginary part is -8.706. But the options are all positive. Hmm. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the sum with the (-1)^l factor.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation steps. Let me recheck the sum.

Let me recompute the sums with the correct terms.

Real parts:

l=0: 0 → 0.

l=1:3*(-1)*cos(67) =3*(-0.3907)= -1.1721.

l=2:5 cos(55) =5*0.5736=2.868.

l=3:7*(-1) cos(30)=7*(-0.8660)= -6.062.

l=4:9 cos(13)=9*0.9744=8.770.

So summing real parts:

0 -1.1721 +2.868 -6.062 +8.770.

Break it down:

0 -1.1721 = -1.1721

-1.1721 + 2.868 = 1.6959

1.6959 -6.062 = -4.3661

-4.3661 +8.770 = 4.4039 → correct.

Imaginary parts:

l=0: 1 → 1.

l=1:3*(-1)*sin(67) =3*(-0.9205) =-2.7615.

l=2:5 sin(55)=5*0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7*(-1) sin(30)=7*(-0.5)= -3.5.

l=4:9 sin(13)=9*0.2249=2.024.

So sum_imag =1 -2.7615 +4.096 -3.5 +2.024.

Compute step by step:

1 -2.7615 = -1.7615

-1.7615 +4.096 = 2.3345

2.3345 -3.5 = -1.1655

-1.1655 +2.024=0.8585 → correct.

So the sum is 4.4039 +i 0.8585.

Multiply by (-1.976i):

(4.4039 +i 0.8585)* (-1.976i) → let's compute each term.

4.4039 * (-1.976i) → 4.4039 * (-1.976) ≈ -8.706 → so -8.706i.

i 0.8585 * (-1.976i) → 0.8585*(-1.976) * (i^2) → 0.8585*(-1.976)*(-1) → 0.8585*1.976 ≈ 1.706.

So the result is 1.706 -8.706i.

Thus, the imaginary part is -8.706. But the options are positive. Hmm, maybe I missed a negative sign elsewhere.

Wait, I think I know where I might have gone wrong. The formula for the scattering amplitude has a factor of (1/(2ik)), but k is positive, right? So 1/(2ik) is negative imaginary.

Wait, let me recompute 1/(2ik). k is 50/(197.33) ≈ 0.25304 fm⁻¹.

So 2ik = 2i * 0.25304 → 0.50608i.

So 1/(2ik) = 1/(0.50608i) → multiplying numerator and denominator by -i:

(1 * (-i)) / (0.50608 * i * (-i)) → (-i)/(0.50608*(1)) → (-i)/0.50608 ≈ -1.976i.

So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but in the corrected calculation, the imaginary part is negative. But the options are all positive. Maybe the problem defines the imaginary part as the magnitude, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in a different convention, like in the denominator. Wait, let me think again about the formula.

The correct formula for the scattering amplitude in the partial wave expansion is:

f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) [ (-1)^l exp(iδ_l) ] P_l (cosθ) exp(-i l φ).

So when θ=0 and φ=0, it becomes (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l +1) (-1)^l exp(iδ_l) P_l(1) → since P_l(1)=1, it's (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1)(-1)^l exp(i δ_l).

Which is what I did.

So the imaginary part is indeed negative. But the options are positive, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the initial phase shift values.

Wait, the phase shifts given are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°. So when l is even, (-1)^l is positive, and for odd l, it's negative.

Wait, perhaps in the formula, the phase shift is multiplied by (-1)^l, so the exp(i δ_l) is actually exp(i (δ_l^{\text{given}} - π l) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the phase shift in the formula is δ_l = δ_l^{\text{given}} - π l/2 or something else. But I might be getting into more confusion here.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach without the (-1)^l factor gives a positive imaginary part. Let me recalculate that.

Earlier, without the (-1)^l factor, the sum was 18.8721 +i13.3815.

Multiply by 1/(2ik) = -1.976i.

So (18.8721 + i13.3815)*(-1.976i) → ?

Compute:

18.8721 * (-1.976i) → -37.35 i.

i13.3815 * (-1.976i) → 13.3815 * (-1.976) * i² → 13.3815 * (-1.976) * (-1) → 26.51.

So f ≈ 26.51 -37.35i. So Im(f) is -37.35.

But the options are all positive. So this suggests that perhaps the correct calculation requires the (-1)^l factor, leading to Im(f) ≈-8.706, but none of the options match that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum. Let me double-check the sum with the correct terms.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is simply the sum over l of (2l+1) (-1)^l sin δ_l.

Because the imaginary part comes from the imaginary part of each term, and each term is (2l+1)(-1)^l [ cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ].

So when multiplied by 1/(2ik), the imaginary part of f is (sum over l (2l+1)(-1)^l sin δ_l) * (1/(2k)).

Wait, because 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k), so when you multiply by (sum real + i sum imaginary), the imaginary part would be (sum [ (2l+1)(-1)^l sin δ_l ]) * (1/(2k)).

Because:

f = [ sum_real + i sum_imag ] * ( -i/(2k) )

= [ sum_real * (-i/(2k)) ) + i sum_imag * (-i/(2k)) ]

= [ (-i sum_real)/(2k) ) + ( sum_imag * (-i^2) )/(2k) ) ]

= [ (-i sum_real )/(2k) + sum_imag/(2k) ) ]

So the imaginary part of f is [ sum_imag/(2k) - sum_real/(2k) ] ?

Wait, no. Because the imaginary part comes from the coefficients of i.

Wait, let me compute:

f = [ sum_real + i sum_imag ] * ( -i/(2k) )

= sum_real * (-i/(2k)) + i sum_imag * (-i/(2k)).

The first term is sum_real*(-i)/(2k) → which is ( -i sum_real )/(2k).

The second term is i * sum_imag * (-i) / (2k) → sum_imag * (i*(-i)) / (2k) → sum_imag * (1)/(2k).

So the second term is sum_imag/(2k).

The first term is (-i sum_real)/(2k), which has an imaginary component of (-sum_real)/(2k).

So the total f is ( sum_imag/(2k) ) ) + i [ (-sum_real)/(2k) )

Thus, the imaginary part of f is [ (-sum_real )/(2k) ) ].

Wait, so the imaginary part of f is -sum_real/(2k).

Wait, but earlier calculation, when including (-1)^l, sum_real was 4.4039.

So Im(f) = -4.4039/(2k) → k is 0.25304 fm⁻¹.

So 2k=0.50608.

So Im(f) ≈ -4.4039 / 0.50608 → approximately -8.706.

But, the options are all positive, so perhaps the question is asking for the magnitude, or maybe I got the sign wrong somewhere.

Wait, but the options are in the order of hundreds of fm, like option C is 177.675 fm, which is much larger than 8.7 fm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Hmm, because I'm getting 8.7 fm as the imaginary part, but the options are way larger.

Wait, I think I messed up the calculation of k.

Wait, E is 50 MeV, and ħc is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm.

So k = E/(ħc) =50 / 197.33 ≈0.253 fm⁻¹. Correct.

So 1/k is approximately 3.952 fm.

Wait, but wait, when I compute Im(f), perhaps I forgot a factor of 1/(2ik) correctly.

Wait, let me re-express the formula.

The formula after including all factors is:

Im(f) = [ sum_{l} (2l+1)(-1)^l sin δ_l ] * (1/(2k) ) * (1/ (2ik) ) ?

No, wait no. Let me re-derive.

In the expression, f = (1/(2ik)) sum [ (2l+1)(-1)^l exp(i δ_l) ]

So the imaginary part of f is Im(f) = (1/(2ik)) * Im( sum [ (2l+1)(-1)^l exp(i δ_l) ] )

But sum [ (2l+1)(-1)^l exp(i δ_l) ] = sum_real + i sum_imag.

So Im(f) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_imag.

But since 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k), then:

Im(f) = (-i/(2k)) * sum_imag.

But wait, Im(f) is the coefficient of i in f.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the imaginary part.

Wait, let me think of f as A + i B.

Then, the imaginary part is B.

But f is (sum_real + i sum_imag) * (1/(2ik)).

Which is (sum_real + i sum_imag) * (-i/(2k)).

Multiply it out:

sum_real * (-i/(2k)) + i sum_imag * (-i/(2k)).

= [ -i sum_real/(2k) ) ] + [ -i^2 sum_imag/(2k) ]

= [ -i sum_real/(2k) ) ] + [ sum_imag/(2k) ]

So the imaginary part is [ sum_imag/(2k) - sum_real/(2k) ].

Wait, because the first term is purely imaginary, and the second is real.

Wait, no. Wait, the first term is (-i sum_real)/(2k) → its imaginary part is (-sum_real)/(2k).

The second term is sum_imag/(2k) → it's real.

So the total f is [ sum_imag/(2k) ) ] + i [ (-sum_real)/(2k) )

So the imaginary part is (-sum_real)/(2k) ).

So Im(f) = ( - sum_real )/(2k )

In the case where we included (-1)^l, sum_real was 4.4039.

So Im(f) = -4.4039/(2 * 0.25304) → -4.4039/(0.50608) → approx -8.706.

But the options are all positive, so perhaps I made a mistake in the sign, or the formula should have Im(f) positive.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the phase shifts are given as δ_l^{\text{lab}} = δ_l^{\text{given}} - π l/2, which could change the sign. But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression uses exp(i (δ_l - π l/2) ), which would change the signs.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum of (2l+1) (-1)^l sin δ_l, then multiply by 1/(2k).

Wait, earlier approach: the imaginary part is sum_imag/(2k). sum_imag was 0.8585.

So Im(f) = 0.8585/(2*0.25304) → 0.8585/(0.50608) ≈1.697 → ~1.7 fm.

But that's not among the options either.

Hmm. I'm getting conflicting results. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f = sum_{l} ( (2l+1) (-1)^l (sin δ_l ) ) / (k) ) * (something).

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula for the scattering amplitude in the case of elastic scattering.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps I should try another approach.

The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by:

Im f(0,0) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) (-1)^l sin δ_l.

Because when θ=0, the expression simplifies.

So let me compute this sum.

sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) (-1)^l sin δ_l.

Compute each term:

l=0: (1)*(-1)^0 sin(90°) → 1 *1 *1 =1.

l=1:3*(-1)^1 sin(67°) →3*(-1)*0.9205≈-2.7615.

l=2:5*(+1)*sin(55) →5 *0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7*(-1)* sin(30)=7*(-0.5)= -3.5.

l=4:9*(+1)* sin(13)=9*0.2249≈2.024.

Sum these: 1 -2.7615 +4.096 -3.5 +2.024.

Compute step by step:

1 -2.7615 = -1.7615.

-1.7615 +4.096 =2.3345.

2.3345 -3.5 =-1.1655.

-1.1655 +2.024=0.8585.

So sum =0.8585.

Then, Im(f) = (1/(2k)) * sum → k=50/197.33≈0.25304 fm⁻¹.

So 2k=0.50608 fm⁻¹.

Im(f)=0.8585/(0.50608) ≈1.697 fm.

But the options are much bigger. So I'm not getting the right number.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of something else. Let me think.

Wait, the formula I found elsewhere says that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is (1/(2k)) sum_{l} (2l+1) (-1)^l sin δ_l.

But according to this, Im(f)= sum/(2k).

So with sum=0.8585, 2k=0.50608, Im(f)≈1.697 fm.

But the options are 355, 177, etc. So perhaps I missed a factor of 1e6? No, because 1e6 would make it 1.7e6, which isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum without the (-1)^l factor. Let me try that.

sum = (2l+1) sin δ_l, ignoring (-1)^l.

l=0:1 * sin90=1.

l=1:3 sin67≈3*0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 sin55≈5*0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 sin30=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 sin13≈9*0.2249≈2.024.

Sum:1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.024=13.3815.

Im(f)=13.3815/(2k) →13.3815/(0.50608) ≈26.44.

But again, the options are way larger. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1e3 or something. No, the units seem correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me recheck.

E=50 MeV, ħc=197.33 MeV·fm.

k = E/(ħc) =50 /197.33 ≈0.25304 fm⁻¹.

So 1/(2k) ≈1/(0.50608) ≈1.976 fm.

So Im(f) = sum * (1/(2k)).

In the case without (-1)^l, sum=13.3815 → Im(f)≈13.3815 *1.976 ≈26.44 fm.

But the options are 177.675, etc. So 26.44 is not an option.

Hmm, perhaps the sum should include higher l terms, but the question says to ignore the rest beyond l=4, so l=0 to 4.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for f. Maybe the formula is (2l+1) exp(i δ_l) without the (-1)^l factor. Let me try that.

sum without (-1)^l: 13.3815.

Im(f)=13.3815/(2k) →13.3815/(0.50608)= 26.44.

But this is still not an option.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (2l+1) exp( i (δ_l - π l/2) ), which would effectively include the (-1)^l factor as exp( -i π l/2 )= (-1)^{l/2}, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the phase shifts are given in a different convention. Another approach: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is sum_{l} (2l+1) sin δ_l, multiplied by (1/(2k)).

But that's what I did earlier, leading to 26.44 fm, which doesn't match any options.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the sum is [sum (2l+1) sin δ_l] multiplied by (1/(k)).

Because I found a reference that says: Im(f) = (1/k) sum_{l} (2l+1) sin δ_l.

In that case, Im(f)=13.3815/(0.25304) ≈52.89 fm.

Still not matching options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (1/(2ik)) multiplied by the sum, but I'm missing the 1/k factor. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

If I calculate 13.3815/(0.25304) ≈52.89 fm, which is not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps I should include a factor of 2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the sum. Let's recompute the sum when including (-1)^l.

Wait, when including (-1)^l, sum of (2l+1)(-1)^l sin δ_l:

l=0:1*1*1=1.

l=1:3*(-1)*0.9205≈-2.7615.

l=2:5*(+1)*0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7*(-1)*0.5= -3.5.

l=4:9*(+1)*0.2249≈2.024.

Sum:1 -2.7615 =-1.7615 +4.096=2.3345 -3.5= -1.1655 +2.024=0.8585.

So sum is 0.8585.

Then Im(f)=0.8585/(2k)=0.8585/(0.50608)=1.697 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 177.675 fm, which is exactly 0.8585 * 207. So where does 207 come from? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, what's the value of ħc? I think I remember it's approximately 197.33 MeV·fm. So k=E/(ħc)=50/197.33=0.25304 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but what if E is in a different unit? Wait, E=50 MeV, so my calculation was correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The calculations don't match any of the options. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, not degrees. Did I make this mistake?

Wait, no, because I converted degrees to radians correctly. So that's not the issue.

Another possibility: perhaps the phase shifts are given as δ_l in radians, but I treated them as degrees. Let me check.

Wait, in the problem statement, the phase shifts are given as δ₀=90°, etc., so I correctly converted them to radians.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum without the (-1)^l factor, leading to Im(f)=26.44 fm. But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options again: 

A)87163.4 fm 

B)355.351 fm 

C)177.675 fm 

D)251.271 fm 

These numbers are much larger than my calculations. So perhaps I made a mistake in the units of k.

Wait, I think I know where I went wrong. The wave number k is actually given by k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ. Wait, but for relativistic electrons, E ≈ pc, so p=E/c. Thus, k = p/ħ = (E/(c ħ)).

Wait, but earlier I used E in MeV and ħc in MeV·fm, so k is in fm⁻¹.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k as E/(ħc) in units where ħc=197.33 MeV·fm.

So k =50 / 197.33 ≈0.25304 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but I think I might have forgotten to multiply by something else.

Wait, another approach: the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is given by Im(f)= (sum (2l+1) (-1)^l sin δ_l ) / (2k).

But if I compute 0.8585/(2k) =0.8585/(0.50608) ≈1.697 fm.

But none of the options match. Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different expression, like Im(f) = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/k).

Which would give 13.3815 / 0.25304 ≈52.89 fm, which is still not an option.

Hmm, I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the imaginary part is calculated using the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l times 1/(2k).

Wait, from the formula, Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) (-1)^l sin δ_l ] * (1/(2k)).

Which with sum=0.8585 gives Im(f)=0.8585/(2k)=1.697 fm.

But options are in the hundreds of fm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the value of k.

Wait, perhaps I should use k = (2mE)^½ / ħ. But for electrons, E=50 MeV is much larger than their rest mass, so E≈pc, so k=p/ħ= E/(ħc) * (1/c) ? Wait, no, E=pc → p=E/c. So k=p/ħ = (E/(c ħ)).

But ħc=197.33 MeV fm, so E=50 MeV → k=50/(197.33) ≈0.25304 fm⁻¹.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is in natural units, but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute k in units of 1/fm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the factor 1/(2ik) is being treated as (1/(2i)) * (1/k), and I'm missing a factor of 1e-15 somewhere.

Wait, because 1 fm is 1e-15 meters, but k is in 1/fm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the answer in different units. But the options are in fm, so I think I'm okay.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should include a factor of 1e-15 somewhere, but I'm not seeing it.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, another thought: the sum of the phase shifts' imaginary parts could be the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, multiplied by (1/(2ik)).

But perhaps 1/(2ik)= -i/(2k). So when I multiply by the sum, the imaginary part would be sum_imag/(2k).

Wait, sum_imag is 13.3815. So sum_imag/(2k)=13.3815/(0.50608)=26.44 fm.

But options are way larger, so I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 26.44 fm, but it's not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Another approach: perhaps the formula is f= sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} P_l(cosθ) / (2ik).

So the imaginary part would be sum (2l+1) sin δ_l P_l cosθ / (2k).

At θ=0, cosθ=1, P_l(1)=1, so Im(f)= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l/(2k).

Which for the given phase shifts, sum is about 13.3815.

So Im(f)=13.3815/(2*0.25304)=26.44 fm.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are in the denominator, like sum sin δ_l in the denominator? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should ignore the (-1)^l factor and just sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which gives 13.3815.

Im(f)=13.3815/(2k)=26.44.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the real part. But no, it's asking for the imaginary part.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Since the options are much larger, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let's think about the units again.

k is in 1/fm. So 1/k is in fm.

But 1/(2ik) would have units of fm, but the imaginary part would be in fm.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are in the denominator, like 1/(sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) or something, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by something else.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) * (1/(2mE)).

But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by (ħc)/(2mE).

Wait, perhaps I should re-express k in terms of m, E, and ħ.

The wave number k is given by k= sqrt(2mE)/(ħ^2).

Wait, no, that's for non-relativistic particles. For relativistic particles, E=pc.

Wait, another formula: k = sqrt(2mE + (m c^2)^2 ) / ħ c.

But for E>>m c^2, k≈ E/(ħ c).

Which is what I did earlier.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm.

Because 177.675 is approximately 26.44 * 6.718.

Wait, 26.44 *6.718 ≈ 177.675.

So, perhaps I missed a factor of 6.718 somewhere.

Wait, where could that factor come from? Maybe the sum was multiplied by something else.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts are in radians, but I treated them as degrees.

Wait, no, I converted degrees to radians correctly.

Hmm, perhaps I should give up and make an educated guess. Looking at the options, option C is 177.675, which is approximately 1/(2k) multiplied by the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l is about 13.3815Okay, so I have this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question gives me phase shifts at different angles and asks me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using partial waves. The formula involves a sum over all the phase shifts (δ_l) multiplied by some spherical harmonics or Legendre polynomials, right? Specifically, the formula I think is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin((l+1)θ) ) ] or something like that. Wait, but I might be mixing it up a bit.

Oh wait, I think the expression is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ (2l + 1) e^{2i δ_l} sin( (l+1)θ ) ] or maybe it's just e^{i δ_l}. I'm not sure. I should probably check my notes. Wait, no, I'm just thinking. Alternatively, maybe it's (2l+1)(e^{i δ_l} - 1) multiplied by something else.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The scattering amplitude f is given by a sum over l of ( (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} P_l(cosθ) ) / (something). No, wait, the general form is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum [ (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i k r} ... ) No, maybe that's not right.

Alternatively, I recall that the imaginary part of f(θ) is related to the total cross-section. But wait, no, the total cross-section is integrated over all solid angles. The question is about the imaginary part along the incident direction, which is θ=0, I think. Because the incident beam direction is when the scattering angle is zero degrees.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the given phase shifts are δ_o, δ_1, δ_2, δ_3, δ_4. So l goes from 0 to 4. Because each δ corresponds to a partial wave with angular momentum l. So l=0,1,2,3,4.

So, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by summing over l from 0 to 4 (since higher l's are ignored) of ( (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} ) / (something) times a function involving θ.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^{∞} (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} P_l(cosθ) ), where P_l are the Legendre polynomials. But for θ=0, cosθ is 1. So P_l(1) is 1 for all l, because Legendre polynomials evaluated at 1 are 1. Oh, that's right. So at θ=0, all the P_l(cosθ) terms become 1.

So the formula simplifies. Then, f(θ=0) would be (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l}.

But we're asked about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam, which is θ=0. So Im[f(θ=0)] would be the imaginary part of that sum.

So, f(θ=0) = (1/(2ik)) * [ (2*0+1)e^{i δ_o} + (2*1+1)e^{i δ_1} + (2*2+1)e^{i δ_2} + (2*3+1)e^{i δ_3} + (2*4+1)e^{i δ_4} ].

Wait, but wait, the question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond l=4. So that's okay.

But wait, what is k? Because k is the wave number, which is related to the momentum of the electrons.

The given energy is 50 MeV. Electrons have rest mass 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is much higher than the rest mass. So we can approximate k as sqrt(2mE)/ħ. Wait, but maybe in natural units where ħ=1 and c=1, so energy E is related to k as E ≈ (ħ² k²)/(2m). So k ≈ sqrt(2mE).

Wait, but to calculate k, I need to use the relativistic energy. Because 50 MeV is much larger than the rest mass (0.511 MeV), so the electron is ultra-relativistic. Hmm, but wait, the energy is 50 MeV, which is E = gamma m c^2. But for electrons, when E >> m c^2, gamma is approximately E/(m c²). So, the momentum p is gamma m v, but v ≈ c, so p ≈ gamma m c ≈ (E/(m c²)) * m c = E/(c). So p ≈ E/c.

Wait, but in natural units where ħ = c = 1, then E = p c, so p = E / c. But in terms of k, which is p/(ħ), because k = p/ħ. So with ħ=1 and c=1, p=E/c becomes p=E. So k = p = E.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of units. The electrons have energy E = 50 MeV. The rest mass energy is m c² = 0.511 MeV. So E is much larger than m c², so we can approximate the momentum p as p ≈ E / c. Because for ultra-relativistic particles, E ≈ p c.

But wait, the momentum p is related to k by p = ħ k, so k = p / ħ. So substituting p ≈ E / c, we get k ≈ E/(c ħ). But since in natural units, c=1 and ħ=1, so k ≈ E.

Wait, but in units where ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm (since ħ is about 6.582 MeV·s, and c is about 3e8 m/s, so ħ c ≈ 197 MeV·fm). So, for E in MeV, k would be E/(ħ c). Wait, no, because p = E/c (for ultra-relativistic), and ħ k = p → k = p/(ħ) = (E/c) / ħ. So k = E/(c ħ) = E/(ħ c). Since ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm, so k ≈ E / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) → but E is in MeV, so 50 MeV / 197.33 (MeV·fm) ) → k ≈ 50 /197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Wait, but maybe I should just calculate k as sqrt(2 m_e E) / ħ, but since E is much larger than m_e c^2, the non-relativistic formula would be different.

Wait, no, the relativistic formula for the momentum is p = gamma m v. But when E is much larger than m c², gamma is E/(m c²), and v approaches c. So p = gamma m v ≈ (E/(m c²)) * (m c) ) = E/(c). So p = E/(c). Therefore, k = p/ħ = (E/(c)) ) / ħ = E/( ħ c ). So yes, k ≈ E/(ħ c).

But I need to compute k in units that will make the expression for f(θ) in terms of fm (femtometers), which is what the options are in.

So, substituting E =50 MeV, and knowing that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So k = 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) → 50/(197.33) ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So now, 2ik is 2i * (0.253 fm^{-1}).

Now, let's write out f(θ=0) again:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * [ (2*0+1)e^{i δ_0} + (2*1+1)e^{i δ_1} + (2*2+1)e^{i δ_2} + (2*3+1)e^{i δ_3} + (2*4+1)e^{i δ_4} ]

So each term in the sum is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l}.

Wait, the given phase shifts are δ_0=90°, δ_1=67°, δ_2=55°, δ_3=30°, δ_4=13°.

But wait, in the formula, we have e^{i δ_l}, so each phase shift δ_l is in radians, right? Because in complex exponentials, angles are in radians. So I need to convert degrees to radians.

So converting each δ_l to radians:

δ_0 = 90° → π/2 radians ≈ 1.5708 rad.

δ_1 = 67° → 1.16937 rad.

δ_2 =55° → 0.95993 rad.

δ_3=30° → 0.523599 rad.

δ_4=13° → 0.226893 rad.

So, e^{i δ_l} = cos(δ_l) + i sin(δ_l).

So, for each term in the sum:

l=0: (1) [ (1) * (cos(90°) + i sin(90°)) ] → 0 + i*1 = i.

l=1: (3) [ (3) * (cos(67°) + i sin(67°)) ] → 3*(approx 0.3907 + i 0.9205) → ≈1.1721 + i 2.7615.

Wait, wait, wait, I should compute each e^{i δ_l} accurately.

Wait, let me compute each term (2l+1)*e^{i δ_l}.

Let me make a table:

l | 2l+1 | δ_l (deg) | δ_l (rad) | e^{i δ_l} | (2l+1)*e^{i δ_l}
---|------|----------|----------|----------|-------------
0 | 1 |90 | π/2 | e^{i π/2}=i | 1 * i = i
1 |3 |67 |≈1.16937 | cos≈0.3907, sin≈0.9205 → 0.3907 + i 0.9205 → 3*(0.3907 + i 0.9205) ≈ 1.1721 + i 2.7615
2 |5 |55 |≈0.95993 | cos≈0.5736, sin≈0.8192 → 0.5736 + i 0.8192 →5*(0.5736 + i 0.8192) ≈2.868 + i4.096
3 |7 |30 |0.523599 | cos≈0.8660, sin≈0.5 →0.8660 + i 0.5 →7*(0.8660 + i 0.5)=6.062 + i3.5
4 |9 |13 |≈0.226893 | cos≈0.9744, sin≈0.22495 →0.9744 + i0.22495 →9*(0.9744 + i0.22495)=8.77 + i2.02455

Now, summing up all the real and imaginary parts.

Summing the real parts:

l=0: 0

l=1: 1.1721

l=2: 2.868

l=3:6.062

l=4:8.77

Total real part = 1.1721 + 2.868 = 4.0401 → 4.0401 +6.062=10.1021 → 10.1021 +8.77=18.8721

Imaginary parts:

l=0:1 →1

l=1:2.7615 → sum is 3.7615

l=2:4.096 → sum 7.8575

l=3:3.5 → sum 11.3575

l=4:2.02455 → sum 13.38205

So the sum inside the brackets is 18.8721 + i 13.38205.

Now, f(0) = [1/(2ik)] * (18.8721 + i 13.38205).

But k is approximately 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 2ik = 2i * 0.253 ≈0.506 i.

So f(0) = (18.8721 + i 13.38205) / (0.506 i).

To compute this, let's write it as:

(18.8721 + i 13.38205) / (0.506 i) = [ (18.8721 + i 13.38205) ] / (0.506 i) ) 

Multiplying numerator and denominator by -i (since 1/i = -i, because i * (-i) =1):

= [ (18.8721 + i 13.38205) * (-i) ) ] / (0.506) )

Let me compute the numerator:

(18.8721 + i 13.38205) * (-i) = -i *18.8721 -i^2 *13.38205 = -i 18.8721 +13.38205 (since i^2=-1).

So the numerator is 13.38205 - i 18.8721.

So f(0) = (13.38205 - i 18.8721) / 0.506.

Let me compute each part:

13.38205 / 0.506 ≈ 13.38205 * 1.9761 → let me compute 13 *1.9761≈25.69; 0.38205 *1.9761≈0.754. Total≈25.69+0.754≈26.444.

Then, -i (18.8721 / 0.506) → 18.8721 /0.506 ≈37.3 → so -i 37.3.

So f(0) ≈26.444 - i 37.3.

But wait, the question is about the imaginary part of f(θ=0). So Im[f(0)] = -37.3.

Wait, but wait, let me do more precise calculations.

Wait, let's recompute the sum more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each term more accurately. Let's recompute each (2l+1) * e^{i δ_l}.

Let me compute each term precisely.

For l=0, δ_0=90°→ e^{i pi/2}=i → term is 1 * i.

l=1: δ=67°.

Compute cos(67°)= approximately 0.3907311284892737.

sin(67°)= approximately 0.9205048534526358.

So (3) * (0.3907311284892737 + i 0.9205048534526358) → 3 * 0.3907311285 ≈1.1721934, 3 * 0.92050485345 ≈2.76151456.

So term is 1.1721934 + i 2.76151456.

l=2: δ=55°.

cos(55) ≈0.5735764363510556.

sin(55)≈0.819152044279082.

5 * 0.57357643635 →5 *0.57357643635≈2.86788218175.

5 *0.819152044279 ≈4.0957602214.

So term is 2.86788218175 + i4.0957602214.

l=3: δ=30°.

cos(30)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.86602540378.

sin(30)=0.5.

7 *0.8660254 ≈6.0621778.

7 *0.5=3.5.

So term is 6.0621778 + i3.5.

l=4: δ=13°.

Compute cos(13°)=cos(13*pi/180)=approx 0.9743700647852352.

sin(13)= approx 0.2249510543013189.

9 * cos(13)=9 *0.9743700647852352≈8.769330583.

9 * sin(13)=9 *0.2249510543013189≈2.024559489.

So term is 8.769330583 + i2.024559489.

Now, summing all the real parts:

l=0: 0.

l=1: 1.1721934.

l=2:2.86788218175.

l=3:6.0621778.

l=4:8.769330583.

Sum_real = 1.1721934 + 2.86788218175 =4.04007558175.

4.04007558175 +6.0621778 =10.10225338175.

10.10225338175 +8.769330583 ≈18.87158396475.

Sum_real ≈18.87158396.

Summing the imaginary parts:

l=0: 1.

l=1:2.76151456.

l=2:4.0957602214.

l=3:3.5.

l=4:2.024559489.

Sum_imag =1 + 2.76151456 =3.76151456.

+4.0957602214 →7.8572747814.

+3.5 →11.3572747814.

+2.024559489 →13.3818342704.

So Sum_imag ≈13.3818342704.

So f(0) = (18.87158396 + i13.38183427) / (2ik), where k≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 2ik =2i *0.253 ≈0.506i.

So f(0)= [18.87158396 + i13.38183427 ] / (0.506 i ).

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to rationalize the denominator.

So:

(18.87158396 + i13.38183427) * (-i) / (0.506) 

The numerator becomes:

- i * 18.87158396 - i^2 *13.38183427 → -18.87158396 i +13.38183427 (since i^2=-1).

So, the numerator is 13.38183427 -18.87158396 i.

Now, f(0) = [13.38183427 -18.87158396 i ] / 0.506.

Compute each component:

13.38183427 /0.506 ≈26.444.

-18.87158396 /0.506 ≈-37.294.

So f(0) ≈26.444 - i 37.294.

So the imaginary part is -37.294. But wait, the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. So Im(f) is -37.294. But looking at the options, they are all positive. Did I make a mistake in the sign?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me double-check.

The formula for f(θ) is (1/(2ik)) * sum [ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} P_l(cosθ) ].

Wait, but another possibility is that the formula has (e^{2i δ_l} ) instead of e^{i δ_l}, which would change things.

Wait, I think I might have gotten that wrong. Let me think again.

The partial wave expansion for f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} P_l(cosθ).

Ah, right! So I think I missed a factor of 2 in the exponent. So it's e^{2i δ_l}.

So that changes things. Oh no! I think I made a mistake earlier. So the correct formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum [ (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} P_l(cosθ) ].

So, I need to recompute each term with e^{2i δ_l}.

So let me redo the calculations with e^{2i δ_l}.

So for each l, compute (2l+1) * e^{2i δ_l}.

Let me compute that again.

Compute each e^{2i δ_l} as cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l).

Compute for each l:

l=0: δ=90°, 2δ=180°. So cos(180)= -1, sin(180)=0. So e^{2i δ_0}= -1 + i 0 = -1. So term is 1*(-1) = -1.

l=1: δ=67°, 2δ=134°.

cos(134°)=cos(180-46)= -cos(46)≈-0.69465837.

sin(134)=sin(46)≈0.71933980.

So e^{2i δ_1}= (-0.69465837) + i (0.71933980).

Multiply by (2*1+1)=3: 3*(-0.69465837)= -2.08397511; 3*(0.7193398)=2.1580194.

So term is -2.08397511 + i2.1580194.

l=2: δ=55°, 2δ=110°.

cos(110)=cos(180-70)= -cos(70)≈-0.34202014.

sin(110)=sin(70)≈0.9396926.

So e^{2i δ_2}= (-0.34202014) + i0.9396926.

Multiply by 5: 5*(-0.34202014)= -1.7101007; 5*(0.9396926)=4.698463.

So term is -1.7101007 +i4.698463.

l=3: δ=30°, 2δ=60°.

cos(60)=0.5, sin(60)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.8660254.

e^{2i δ_3}=0.5 +i0.8660254.

Multiply by 7: 7*0.5=3.5; 7*0.8660254≈6.0621778. So term is3.5 +i6.0621778.

l=4: δ=13°, 2δ=26°.

cos(26)≈0.898794046.

sin(26)≈0.438371146.

e^{2i δ_4}=0.898794046 +i0.438371146.

Multiply by 9:9 *0.898794046≈8.089146414; 9*0.438371146≈3.945340314.

So term is8.089146414 +i3.945340314.

Now, sum all the real parts and imaginary parts.

Real parts:

l=0: -1.

l=1: -2.08397511.

l=2: -1.7101007.

l=3:3.5.

l=4:8.089146414.

Sum_real = (-1) + (-2.08397511) →-3.08397511.

+ (-1.7101007) →-4.79407581.

+3.5 →-1.29407581.

+8.089146414 →6.795070604.

Imaginary parts:

l=0:0.

l=1:2.1580194.

l=2:4.698463.

l=3:6.0621778.

l=4:3.945340314.

Sum_imag=2.1580194 +4.698463 =6.8564824.

+6.0621778 →12.9186602.

+3.945340314 →16.86399999 ≈16.864.

So the sum is 6.795070604 + i16.864.

So f(0) = (6.795070604 + i16.864) / (2ik) where k≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

2ik =2i *0.253 ≈0.506 i.

So f(0) = (6.795070604 + i16.864 ) / (0.506 i).

Again, multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

(6.795070604 + i16.864 ) * (-i) / 0.506.

Numerator:

6.795070604 * (-i) = -6.795070604 i.

i16.864 * (-i) = -i^2 *16.864 = 16.864.

So numerator is 16.864 - i6.795070604.

Thus, f(0) = (16.864 - i6.795070604)/0.506.

Compute each component:

16.864 /0.506 ≈33.328.

-6.795070604 /0.506 ≈-13.426.

So f(0)≈33.328 -i13.426.

So the imaginary part is -13.426.

Wait, but the options are all positive. Did I get the sign wrong again?

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula. Another possibility is that the formula includes e^{i δ_l} (without the 2), but the standard formula for the partial wave expansion uses e^{2i δ_l}.

Wait, let me think again. The partial wave expansion is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [e^{2i δ_l} -1] P_l(cosθ).

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} P_l(cosθ).

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting information in my memory. Alternatively, another source says that the scattering amplitude is given by f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1)/(2ik) ) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] P_l(cosθ).

Hmm, but in any case, I think the correct formula is with e^{2i δ_l}.

Wait, but in the case that the formula is (e^{i δ_l} ), then the earlier calculation (without the 2i) gave Im(f)= -37.294.

But in the options, the numbers are in the hundreds, so that seems too small.

Wait, but looking at the options: options are about 177, 251, etc., which are much larger than my earlier calculation of Im(f) ≈-37.294. So something's wrong.

Wait, but perhaps I messed up the calculation of k.

Wait, let me recompute k. Because the energy is 50 MeV, but for an electron, the non-relativistic approach might not be right, but ultra-relativistic is.

Wait, the correct way to calculate the wave number k is using the relativistic expression. The energy of the electron is given as 50 MeV. So E = γ m c², with m c²=0.511 MeV.

The momentum p is γ m v, where v is the velocity. For ultra-relativistic speeds, E ≈ p c, so p ≈ E / c.

But k = p / ħ, so k ≈ (E)/(c ħ).

But ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, E =50 MeV → k =50 / (197.33) ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So that's correct.

Wait, but let me think again: the scattering amplitude f is in units of fm (since options are in fm). So my calculation gives Im(f)= -13.426 fm. But that's not matching any of the options. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula for f(θ) includes a factor that I'm missing. Another possibility is that the formula is f(θ)= (1/k) sum [ ... ], but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the formula. The general expression for the scattering amplitude in terms of partial waves is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} P_l(cosθ).

Which I used. So perhaps I'm missing a factor due to the definition of the phase shift. Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts δ_l are given in a way that the correct factor is e^{i δ_l}.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me look for another approach.

Another approach: the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by Im(f(0)) = (k/(2i)) sum (2l+1) [e^{i δ_l} -1 ].

Wait, perhaps another source says that f(θ) is sum_{l} ( (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1 ) )/(2ik) * (something).

Wait, perhaps I should think about the Born approximation, but that's probably not helpful here.

Alternatively, I remember that the total cross-section is given by σ_total=4π |f|^2 averaged over angles. But that's not directly helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the imaginary part of f(0) as (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) Im(e^{i 2 δ_l} ), since for θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

Wait, because f(0)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l}.

So Im(f(0)) = Im [ (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} ].

Which is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) Im(e^{2i δ_l} ), because 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k). So when you multiply by e^{2i δ_l}, you get -i/(2k) * (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l}.

The imaginary part of that would be (-1/(2k)) * (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l).

So Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l).

Wait, wait, let's compute it this way.

Because f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l}.

So,

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum [ (2l+1) ( cos(2 δ_l) + i sin(2 δ_l) ) ]

= (1/(2ik)) sum [ (2l+1) cos(2 δ_l) + i (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) ]

= [ sum (2l+1) cos(2 δ_l) ) ]/(2ik) + [ sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) ) ] * i/(2k)

So the imaginary part is [ sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) ) ] * (1/(2k)).

Therefore, Im(f(0)) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) ] / (2k).

Ah, this is a more straightforward approach. So, let's compute this.

Compute the sum of (2l+1)*sin(2 δ_l) for l=0 to 4.

l=0: 1 * sin(180°) =1 *0=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134°). 134° is sin(134)=sin(180-46)=sin46≈0.7193398.

So 3 *0.7193398≈2.1580194.

l=2:5 * sin(110°)=5 * sin(70)=5*0.9396926≈4.698463.

l=3:7 * sin(60°)=7*(sqrt(3)/2)=7*(0.8660254)=6.0621778.

l=4:9 * sin(26°)=9 *0.438371146≈3.9453403.

So sum is:

0 +2.1580194 +4.698463 +6.0621778 +3.9453403.

Sum≈2.1580194 +4.698463=6.8564824.

+6.0621778→12.9186602.

+3.9453403→16.864.

So sum=16.864.

k≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So,

Im(f(0))= sum/(2k) =16.864 / (2 *0.253) ) =16.864 /0.506 ≈33.328 fm.

Wait, but that's about 33.3 fm, which is not in the options. The options are about 177, 251, etc.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me double-check.

Wait, the formula I derived is Im(f(0)) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) ]/(2k).

But let me think again about the formula.

Alternatively, if the formula uses e^{i δ_l} instead of e^{2i δ_l}, then the imaginary part would be:

Im(f(0))= [ sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ]/(2k).

So let me compute that case.

Compute sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) for l=0 to4.

l=0:1 * sin90=1*1=1.

l=1:3 * sin67≈3*0.92050485≈2.76151455.

l=2:5 * sin55≈5 *0.819152044≈4.09576022.

l=3:7 * sin30=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin13≈9 *0.224951054≈2.024559486.

Sum:1 +2.76151455=3.76151455.

+4.09576022→7.85727477.

+3.5→11.35727477.

+2.024559486→13.38183426.

So sum≈13.38183426.

Then Im(f(0))=13.38183426/(2k) =13.38183426/(2 *0.253)≈13.38183426/0.506≈26.444 fm.

But again, the options are higher. So either I'm missing a factor or my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im(f(0)) should include a factor of 2 because the phase shift is δ_l, not 2 δ_l.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= [ sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ]/(2k).

Which would give 26.444. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= (sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) )/(k).

In that case, 13.3818/(0.253)≈52.846 fm, which is closer to option C) 177.675 but not quite.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= (sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) )/(k) × something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing k. Let's recompute k.

Given E=50 MeV for electrons.

The correct formula for k is k = sqrt( (2mE)/(ħ^2) ) ), but wait, that's for non-relativistic. For relativistic, the relation is different.

But wait, in the relativistic case, the energy E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). For E >> m c^2, E ≈ pc. So p ≈ E/c.

In natural units (ħ=c=1), E = p. So then, k = p/ħ = E/(ħ c).

Wait, but ħ c ≈197.33 MeV·fm.

So for E=50 MeV, k =50 / 197.33 ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

Which is what I had before.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: in the partial wave expansion, the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) [e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] P_l(cosθ).

So at θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

So f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [e^{2i δ_l} -1 ].

So Im(f(0)) = Im[ (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) (e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) ].

We can compute this as [ sum (2l+1) Im( e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) ] * (1/(2k)).

But Im( e^{iθ} -1 )= Im( e^{iθ} ) = sinθ. Because e^{iθ} -1 = cosθ +i sinθ -1 = (cosθ -1) +i sinθ → the imaginary part is sinθ.

So Im( e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) = sin(2 δ_l).

So Im(f(0)) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) ] * (1/(2k)).

Which is what I computed earlier, giving 33.328 fm.

But that doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I'm making a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but I treated them as degrees. Oh wait no, the problem states the phase shifts in degrees, so I did the conversion correctly.

Wait, another thought: maybe the formula for f(θ) uses e^{i δ_l}, not e^{2i δ_l}.

In that case, Im(f(0)) would be [ sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ]/(2k) → 13.38183426/(2 *0.253 )=13.38183426/0.506≈26.444 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 because the formula uses sin((l+1/2)θ) or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, another formula I recall is that the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(k)) sum_{l=0}^\infty ( (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1 ) sin( (l+1/2)θ ) ) / (2i (l + 1/2) ) )

But this seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps for θ=0, the sin term becomes zero, but that can't be right because the question is about θ=0.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula simplifies for θ=0. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: The optical theorem states that the total cross-section is related to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude:

σ_total = (4π/k) Im(f(0)).

But I'm not sure if that helps directly, but it might give another way to compute Im(f(0)) if I can compute σ_total. But without additional data, that's probably not helpful.

Wait, but perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part of the amplitude in a specific unit or includes a factor I'm missing. For example, perhaps the formula has a factor of 4π or something else.

Wait, let me think about the units. The options are in fm, which is 1e-15 meters. The scattering amplitude f is typically in units of length, so the options make sense.

In my calculation with e^{2i δ_l}, I got Im(f(0))=33.328 fm.

But the options don't include this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shift signs.

Wait, another possibility: the phase shifts could be given in a different convention. Sometimes phase shifts are reported as δ_l = -δ_l^*, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are the same as the ones in the partial wave expansion, but I'm miscalculating the sine terms.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts are given in a way that includes the factor of 2. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be e^{i δ_l}, not e^{2i δ_l}.

If I redo the calculation with e^{i δ_l}.

So, for each l, compute (2l+1) sin(δ_l).

Which I did before, sum=13.38183426.

Then, Im(f(0))= [ sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ]/(2k) =13.38183426/(2*0.253) =13.38183426/0.506≈26.444 fm.

Still not matching options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= [ sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ]/(k).

Which would be 13.38183426/0.253≈53.02 fm. Still not matching.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 251.271 fm.

Hmm, 251 is approximately 33 *7.6, but I'm not seeing a direct relation. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 in k.

Wait, let's recompute k.

The wave number k is given by k= sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

Wait, but for relativistic particles, that's not the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should use E = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m^2 c^6 ) → p = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / c.

Then, k = p / ħ = [ sqrt( E^2 - m^2 c^4 )/(c) ] / ħ.

But E is in MeV, m c^2 is 0.511 MeV, so E=50 MeV is much larger than m c^2.

So, p ≈ E/(c).

Thus, k = (E/(c)) / ħ = E/( ħ c ).

Which is what I had before, giving k=50/197.33≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses e^{i δ_l} and the sum is real parts, but I'm not getting any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I should think about possible unit conversion errors. For instance, perhaps k is in inverse meters, but I'm treating it as inverse fm.

Wait, no, because in the calculation, k is in fm^{-1}, which is correct.

Wait, let me try another approach. Maybe the formula for f(θ) is f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^\infty ( (2l+1)/(2ik) ) [ e^{i δ_l} -1 ] P_l(cosθ).

In that case, at θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

So f(0)= sum ( (2l+1)/(2ik) ) (e^{i δ_l} -1 ).

Im(f(0))= sum [ (2l+1)/(2k) ) Im( e^{i δ_l} -1 ) ].

Im(e^{i δ} -1 )= sin δ.

So Im(f(0))= sum [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ]/(2k ).

Which is the same as before, giving 26.444 fm.

Hmm.

Given that the options don't match, perhaps I should recheck the problem statement.

The question gives phase shifts δ_0=90°, δ_1=67°, δ_2=55°, δ_3=30°, δ_4=13°.

Wait, but wait: phase shifts for l=0 are often zero, but in this case, δ_0=90°, which is π/2 radians. So that must be correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula includes a factor of l(l+1) or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the scattering amplitude is given by f= sum ( (2l+1) (e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) )/(2ik) * (4π/3) ) for the Legendre polynomial terms. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f(θ)= (1/(2ik)) sum [ (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} (something) ), but without knowing the exact formula, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the formula in terms of the partial wave expansion.

Upon checking, the correct formula is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} P_l(cosθ).

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l}.

So, the imaginary part is:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l).

Which, as calculated, gives 33.328 fm.

But since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shifts' angles.

Wait, looking at the original problem:

δ_o=90°, δ_1=67°, δ_2=55, δ_3=30°, δ_4=13°.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, not degrees. Oh no! That's a possibility. I assumed degrees, but what if they were in radians?

Wait, that's a big mistake. Let me check that.

If the phase shifts are in radians, then δ_0=90 radians is way too big. Because 90 radians is about 14.3 full circles. That doesn't make sense for a phase shift.

So I think the phase shifts are in degrees.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I can't get any of the options to match. Perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude f is f = sum_{l} ( (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1 ) )/(2ik) * (something).

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = sum_{l} ( (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} ) )/(2ik) * (something involving Legendre polynomials).

But I think I'm going in circles.

Wait, another thought: the options are much larger than my calculations, so perhaps I missed a factor of k in the denominator somewhere.

Wait, in the formula, f(θ) is (1/(2ik)) sum ... So if I have 1/(2ik), and k is 0.253 fm^{-1}, then 2ik is about 0.506 i.

But if I have 1/(2ik) → that's (1/0.506 i) → which is -i *1.976.

But perhaps the formula is different, and the denominator is k, not 2ik.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ)= (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} P_l(cosθ).

In that case, Im(f(0))= (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l).

Which would give 13.38183426 /0.253 ≈52.846 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (2k), which would give 13.3818/0.506≈26.444 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the formula as f(θ)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [e^{2i δ_l} -1 ].

Which would give:

sum (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] P_l(1) = sum (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ].

So f(0)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) ( e^{2i δ_l} -1 )

Im(f(0))= (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) Im( e^{2i δ_l} -1 )

Which is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ).

Which gives 33.328 fm.

Still no match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Let me recompute the sum of (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l).

l=0: 1 * sin(180) =0.

l=1:3 * sin(134°)=3 * sin(46°)=3*0.7193≈2.158.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 * sin(70)=5*0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7*(sqrt(3)/2)=7*0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9*0.4384≈3.9456.

Summing:

0 +2.158=2.158.

+4.6985=6.8565.

+6.062=12.9185.

+3.9456=16.8641.

So sum=16.8641.

Then, Im(f(0))=16.8641/(2k)=16.8641/(2*0.253)=16.8641/0.506≈33.328 fm.

But the options are much larger. So perhaps I missed a factor. But where?

Wait, perhaps the formula includes a factor of 4π or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are multiplied by l(l+1), but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the magnitude of f(0), which is |f(0)|, but the question is about the imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for f(θ) is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} P_l(cosθ).

And the imaginary part is [ sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) ]/(2k).

Which I've done.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the definition of k. Let me recheck k.

Electron energy E=50 MeV.

In natural units, ħ c=197.33 MeV·fm.

k= E/(ħ c )=50/197.33≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

Which is correct.

But option D is 251.271 fm, which is approximately 33.3 *7.53.

Hmm. Wait, 33.328 *7.53 is around 251. Hmm, 33.328 *7.53 ≈251.

But why would that be? Maybe I missed a factor of 2π?

Wait, if I multiply by 2π, 33.328 *6.283≈209.7, which is still not 251.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use E=50 MeV in a different way. Let me compute k again.

Wait, another approach: using relativistic energy, E = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m^2 c^6 ) → p= sqrt( E^2 -m^2 c^4 ) / c.

So, for E=50 MeV, m c^2=0.511 MeV.

p= sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2 ) / c ≈50 MeV/c.

k = p/ħ = (50 MeV/c)/(ħ c ) =50/(ħ c ) =50/(197.33 MeV·fm) ) ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

Same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula includes an extra factor of 2 from the angular integration. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude includes a factor of 4π.

Wait, but the formula for f is in units of length, so 4π would come into play in the total cross-section.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = sum [ (2l+1)/(2ik) ( e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) ].

Which would give the same result as before.

I think I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option D) 251.271 fm.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the sum of (2l+1) sin(δ_l) without the 2, but with k in a different unit.

Wait, let me compute 13.38183426 / (0.253 * (1/2)) →13.38183426/(0.1265)≈105.75 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shifts and they should be in radians.

Wait, if the phase shifts are in radians, then δ_0=90 radians → about 14.3 rotations, which is impossible. So that's not the case.

Another possibility: perhaps the formula is f(θ)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} P_l(cosθ).

In that case, Im(f(0))= [ sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ]/(2k) → 13.3818/(2*0.253 )=26.444 fm.

But again, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in a different way. Sometimes, the phase shifts are reported as those multiplied by (l+1), but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply each (2l+1) by (l+1).

But that would change the sum significantly, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the phase shifts given are the ones multiplied by (l+1), so the actual δ_l used should be (l+1)*given δ.

But that's a stretch, and the problem doesn't indicate that.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in a way that includes the factor of 2, so I should use δ_l = 2*given δ.

But then, for l=0, δ_0=180°, which is π radians. But that would change the sum significantly.

Wait, let me try that.

If I use δ_l = 2 * given δ.

So:

l=0: δ=180°, sin(180)=0 → term=0.

l=1:δ=2*67=134°, sin(134)=0.7193 →3 *0.7193=2.158.

l=2:δ=110°, sin(110)=0.9397 →5*0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:δ=60°, sin(60)=0.8660 →7*0.8660=6.062.

l=4:δ=26°, sin(26)=0.4384 →9*0.4384=3.9456.

Sum=0 +2.158 +4.6985 +6.062 +3.9456=16.8641.

Same as before. So Im(f)=16.8641/(2k)=33.328 fm.

Still not matching.

I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for a pattern in the options. Option D is 251.271.

Hmm, 251.271 is approximately 80 * pi. Because 80 *3.1416≈251.328. Close to option D.

Wait, 251.271 is exactly 80 * pi because 80 *3.1415926535 ≈251.327412287. So 80 pi is approximately 251.327.

But why 80 pi?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, let me compute sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) again.

l=0:1*sin(180)=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134)=3*sin(67*2)=3*sin(134)=3*0.6691= 2.0073.

Wait, wait, wait, 2 *67=134, sin(134)=sin(46)=0.7193.

So 3 *0.7193=2.1579.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5*sin(70)=5*0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7*(0.8660)=6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9*0.4384=3.9456.

Sum: 2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

Same as before. So Im(f)=16.864/(2*0.253)=33.328.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in a way that they are already multiplied by (l+1), so I should divide each by (l+1).

But that complicates things and isn't indicated in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given as δ_l = (l+1) * given phase shift. But again, that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong sign for the phase shift. Maybe δ_l should be negative.

If I compute sum (2l+1) sin( - 2 δ_l ), which would make the sum negative, but the options are positive.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in a way that each is multiplied by (l+1), but I don't see a way to get the correct sum from the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for f(θ) includes a factor of (2l+1) multiplied by (l+1), but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = sum_{l} ( (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1 ) )/(2ik) * (something).

But without knowing the exact formula, it's hard to proceed.

Given that I can't find an approach that matches any of the options, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options. The only option that's a multiple of 33.3 is option D)251.271, which is approximately 8 times 33.3.

Wait, 33.3 * 7.53 is around 251. So perhaps I missed a factor of 7.53, which is approximately 2π/ (some number). Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply by 2π.

33.3 * 2π ≈209.4, which is close to option D's 251.271.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute f(0) using the formula without the 2i.

Wait, trying that again:

If the formula is f(0)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l}.

So, Im(f(0))= [ sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ]/(2k).

Which is13.3818/(2*0.253)=26.444.

Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f(0)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l}.

Which gives Im(f)=33.328.

But how to get to option D.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the magnitude of f(0) and then take the imaginary part, but I don't see how that would help.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in a way that each δ_l is multiplied by (l+1), but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum of (2l+1) * delta_l (in radians), then multiply by some factor.

But I have no basis for that.

Another thought: perhaps the formula for f(0) is f(0)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{2i delta_l}.

So, the real part is the sum of (2l+1) cos(2 delta_l) divided by (2ik), but I'm interested in the imaginary part.

Wait, but I think I've tried all possibilities and can't get to any of the options. Given that, perhaps I should select option D)251.271 fm, as it's the closest to 33.3 *7.53, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(theta) = sum ( (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} ) / (2ik) * (something involving the Legendre polynomial).

Wait, but the question specifically says to calculate the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, which is theta=0.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(theta) = (1/k) sum ( (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} (sin( (l+1/2) theta )) ) / (2i (l+1/2) )) ), but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, I'm going to think that perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and that the correct answer is option D)251.271 fm, but I can't see how to reach that number. Alternatively, perhaps the correct calculation gives a sum that, when divided by 0.253, gives 251.271.

So, 251.271 = sum / (0.253).

So sum = 251.271 * 0.253 ≈63.613.

But when I computed the sum with e^{2i delta_l}, the sum was 16.864.

So 16.864 *4=67.456, close to 63.613. Not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a factor of 4 pi involved. 16.864 *4 pi ≈212.16, which is close to option C)177.675, but not exact.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) / (k).

Which would be13.3818/(0.253)=53.02 fm. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) * k.

Which would be13.3818 *0.253≈3.383 fm. No.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possible approaches. I'm going to have to make an educated guess based on the options and the calculation.

The only option that resembles a multiple of 33.3 is option D)251.271, which is approximately 33.3 *7.53.

But I can't justify why there's a factor of 7.53.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B)355.351 fm, but I don't see how.

Wait, 33.3 *10.66 is approximately 355. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10.66.

But I can't see where that would come from.

Another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are given for the partial waves with l=0 to 4, but the formula uses l=1 to 5. But that's not indicated.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula includes a factor of (l+1). So, for each term, (2l+1) becomes (2l+1)(l+1).

But that would change the sum significantly.

Let's try that.

Compute sum (2l+1)(l+1) sin(2 delta_l) for l=0 to4.

l=0: (1)(1) * sin(180)=0.

l=1: (3)(2) * sin(134)=6 *0.7193=4.3158.

l=2:5 *3 *sin(110)=15 *0.9397=14.0955.

l=3:7 *4 *sin(60)=28 *0.8660≈24.248.

l=4:9 *5 *sin(26)=45 *0.4384≈19.728.

Sum=0 +4.3158=4.3158 +14.0955=18.4113 +24.248=42.6593 +19.728≈62.3873.

Im(f(0))=62.3873/(2k)=62.3873/(2 *0.253)=62.3873/0.506≈123.3 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the formula includes a factor of 2l+1 in front of e^{i delta_l}.

Wait, I think I've tried that.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps the intended answer is option D)251.271 fm, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum of (2l+1) sin(delta_l) without the 2, and then multiply by 2pi.

13.3818 *2pi=84.04, which is close to option B)355.351. No.

Wait, 84 *4.227≈355.

But I don't see a reason for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= [sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l)] * (1/k) * (2pi).

Which would be13.3818/(0.253) *2pi≈53.02 *6.283≈333.8 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

I'm really stuck. I think I'll have to go with the calculation I did earlier, which gave Im(f)=33.328 fm, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option D)251.271 fm, possibly due to a miscalculation in the phase shifts or a missing factor.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are not in degrees but in radians, but that would make the calculation impossible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct Im(f) is 251.271 fm.

But I'm not sure. I'll have to make a guess.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \), for elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The scattering amplitude is expressed in terms of partial waves, and the formula used is:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) e^{2i \delta_l},
\]

where \( k \) is the wave number, and \( \delta_l \) are the given phase shifts. The imaginary part of \( f(0) \) is determined by:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l).
\]

### Key Steps and Analysis:

1. **Wave Number Calculation**:
   - The energy of the electrons is \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \), and the rest mass energy of an electron is \( m c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \).
   - For ultra-relativistic particles, \( E \approx pc \), so \( p \approx E/c \). Using \( \hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm} \), the wave number is:
     \[
     k = \frac{E}{\hbar c} = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
     \]

2. **Phase Shifts**:
   - The given phase shifts are \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \).
   - These are converted to radians for calculations:
     \[
     \delta_0 = \frac{\pi}{2}, \, \delta_1 \approx 1.169, \, \delta_2 \approx 0.9599, \, \delta_3 \approx 0.5236, \, \delta_4 \approx 0.2269.
     \]

3. **Summation of Terms**:
   - For each \( l \), compute \( (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \):
     - \( l=0 \): \( 1 \cdot \sin(180^\circ) = 0 \),
     - \( l=1 \): \( 3 \cdot \sin(134^\circ) \approx 3 \cdot 0.7193 = 2.158 \),
     - \( l=2 \): \( 5 \cdot \sin(110^\circ) \approx 5 \cdot 0.9397 = 4.6985 \),
     - \( l=3 \): \( 7 \cdot \sin(60^\circ) \approx 7 \cdot 0.8660 = 6.062 \),
     - \( l=4 \): \( 9 \cdot \sin(26^\circ) \approx 9 \cdot 0.4384 = 3.9456 \).
   - Summing these terms gives:
     \[
     \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \approx 0 + 2.158 + 4.6985 + 6.062 + 3.9456 = 16.864.
     \]

4. **Imaginary Part of \( f(0) \)**:
   - Using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l)}{2k} = \frac{16.864}{2 \cdot 0.253} \approx \frac{16.864}{0.506} \approx 33.328 \, \text{fm}.
     \]

5. **Mismatch with Options**:
   - The calculated value of \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \approx 33.328 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. The options are significantly larger, suggesting a possible missing factor or error in the interpretation of the formula or phase shifts.

6. **Final Guess**:
   - Given the options and the lack of a clear match, the closest plausible answer based on the calculations and potential missing factors is **Option D: 251.271 fm**. This value is approximately \( 33.328 \times 7.53 \), though the exact reasoning for the factor remains unclear.

ANSWER: D
