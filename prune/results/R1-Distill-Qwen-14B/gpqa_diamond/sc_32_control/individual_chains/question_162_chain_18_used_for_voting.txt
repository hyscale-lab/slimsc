Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but I'll try to think through this step by step.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So, the first thing I notice is that the denominator is 4 minus (x² + y²). That makes me think about the region where this metric is defined. The denominator can't be zero, so 4 - x² - y² ≠ 0. That would mean x² + y² < 4. So the coordinates x and y are constrained to a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. Oh wait, that's interesting because the radius given is r=2. Maybe that's related.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. I've heard that pseudospheres are related to hyperbolic geometry, but I'm not entirely sure. I think a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, but in this context, perhaps we're looking at a metric that describes such a space.

Looking at the metric, it seems to be written in 2D because there are only dx² and dy² terms. So this is a 2-dimensional metric. Pseudospheres are 2D surfaces, I think. So maybe this metric represents a pseudosphere.

The general form of a metric in 2D can be written as ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²), where g(x,y) is the conformal factor. In this case, the conformal factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the metric is conformally flat, meaning it's a conformal transformation of the flat Euclidean metric.

I remember that in such cases, the area element can be found by taking the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor multiplied by dx dy. Since the metric is diagonal with both components equal to g(x,y) = 32/(4 - x² - y²), the determinant is g(x,y)^2. So the square root of the determinant would be g(x,y).

Wait, the area element in 2D for a metric ds² = g(dx² + dy²) is sqrt(det g) dx dy. The determinant of a diagonal metric with both components g is g^2. So sqrt(det g) is g. Therefore, the area element dA is g dx dy.

So in this case, dA = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

The area of the entire space would be the integral of dA over all x and y such that x² + y² <4. Because the metric is defined only where 4 - x² - y² >0, so the domain is the disk of radius 2.

So the area A would be the double integral over this disk of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Hmm, that integral seems a bit tricky. Maybe I should switch to polar coordinates because of the circular symmetry. In polar coordinates, x² + y² = r², and dx dy becomes r dr dθ.

So the integral becomes: ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute this. First, factor out the constants. The 32 and the r and dr terms. The integral over θ is straightforward.

So the integral is 32 * ∫0^{2π} dθ * ∫0^2 [r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Compute the θ integral first: ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

So now it's 32 * 2π * ∫0^2 [r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Wait, let's compute the radial integral ∫0^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → (-du)/2 = r dr. So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫u=4 to u=0 [ (-du/2) / u ].

Which is (-1/2) ∫4^0 (1/u) du.

That's (-1/2)( ln u evaluated from 4 to 0 ). Wait, but when u approaches 0, ln u approaches negative infinity. So this integral might be divergent.

Wait a minute, this is concerning. Let me check the substitution again.

Wait, substitution: u = 4 - r². Then du = -2 r dr. So r dr = - du/2.

So the integral becomes ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr = ∫ (-du/2) / u = (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du.

The limits when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0. So the integral is from u=4 to u=0.

So the integral is (-1/2) [ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

Which is (-1/2)( ln 0 - ln 4 ). Hmm, but ln 0 is negative infinity. So this becomes (-1/2)( -infty - ln4 ) → (-1/2)( -infty ) → positive infinity.

Wait, so the integral ∫0^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr is divergent. It goes to infinity.

So the area A is 32 * 2π * (infinite) → infinite.

Wait, but that's the area? So the area of this pseudosphere is infinite? But that doesn't make sense. I thought pseudospheres have finite area. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the metric given describes a pseudosphere of radius 2, which is a surface with constant negative curvature. In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a pseudosphere (which is like a surface of revolution of a tractrix) is indeed finite. Wait, I'm a bit confused now.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is for a hyperbolic plane, which is non-compact and has infinite area. So in that case, the question might be about the area, which would be infinite.

Wait, the options include D) +infty. So if the area is infinite, then the answer would be D.

But wait, the area of the pseudosphere (also called the tractricoid) is finite. Let me recall: the tractrix has a finite area. The pseudosphere (which is the surface of revolution of the tractrix) also has finite surface area. So perhaps I'm confusing the hyperbolic plane with the pseudosphere.

In that case, if the metric describes a pseudosphere, then its area should be finite. But according to the integral, the area is infinite. That suggests that either the metric isn't for a pseudosphere, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me think again. The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So if x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, and the conformal factor blows up. That suggests that the metric is singular at the boundary x² + y²=4, which is a circle of radius 2. So perhaps this is a model of hyperbolic space, but confined within a disk (like the Poincaré disk model). But in that case, the hyperbolic plane has infinite area.

Wait, but the question is about the pseudosphere. The pseudosphere is a finite area surface, so perhaps I'm getting confused with the metric.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric doesn't represent the entire pseudosphere but just a portion of it. Or maybe the question is a trick question, and the area is infinite because the metric covers an infinite extent in the hyperbolic plane.

Wait, another approach: in 2D, the area can be computed using the Gaussian curvature. The Gauss-Bonnet theorem relates the integral of the Gaussian curvature over a region to its Euler characteristic.

But wait, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for a compact 2-manifold states that ∫ K dA = 2π χ, where χ is the Euler characteristic.

But if the area is infinite, then the integral of K dA might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, for a surface of constant curvature, the total area can be determined. For a sphere of radius a, the area is 4π a². For a pseudosphere (which has negative curvature), the area is finite but depends on the curvature.

Wait, but the pseudosphere is not a compact surface. Because it's like a horn, extending infinitely. So perhaps its area is infinite.

Alternatively, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the metric again.

The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] (dx² + dy²).

Let me see if this is a standard form of a hyperbolic metric. The Poincaré disk model for hyperbolic geometry is usually written as ds² = [4/(1 + x² + y²)]² (dx² + dy²), but that's not matching here. Alternatively, another parametrization. Wait, maybe it's scaled differently.

Wait, another standard form of the Poincaré disk model is ds² = (4/(1 - r²))² (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate (r <1). But our metric is in terms of x and y, which in polar would be r^2 =x² + y². So perhaps the given metric is similar but scaled.

Wait, in our case, the denominator is (4 - r²), so if r goes up to 2 (since 4 - r² >0 → r < 2). So the metric is similar to the Poincaré disk model but scaled with a radius of 2 instead of 1. The Poincaré disk model with radius a has the metric [4/(1 - (r/a)^2)]² (dr² + r² dθ²), but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, but in our case, the conformal factor is 32/(4 - r²). Let's compute 32/(4 - r²) = 8 *4/(4(1 - (r²/4)) ) = 8 * [1/(1 - (r²/4))] ). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's 32/(4 - r²) = 8 * [4/(4 - r²)].

Wait, perhaps the area element is 32/(4 - r²) * r dr dθ.

So, the area would be ∫0^2π ∫0^2 [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ.

As we saw earlier, this integral diverges because near r=2, the denominator approaches zero, making the integrand blow up. So the area is infinite.

But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2. So perhaps the given metric doesn't model a pseudosphere but an infinite hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. Therefore, the area would be infinite.

Alternatively, perhaps the pseudosphere has finite area. Wait, I'm getting confused between the hyperbolic plane and the pseudosphere. The hyperbolic plane is a 2D manifold of constant negative curvature and has infinite area. The pseudosphere is a surface in 3D space, but it's non-compact and has finite area. Or is it infinite?

Wait, upon checking my memory, the pseudosphere (tractricoid) is a surface of constant negative curvature, but it's a finite area surface. Oh wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, the pseudosphere is a surface of revolution of the tractrix, and it's a finite surface, but it's not a complete surface—it has a cusp at the bottom. So the area is finite. But in the context of Riemannian geometry, the pseudosphere is not a manifold with boundary because it has a singularity at the cusp. So perhaps the area is still considered infinite in some sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is not the pseudosphere, but a model of hyperbolic space, which does have infinite area.

So, given all that, the area integral diverges, so the area is infinite. So the correct answer is D) +infty.

The metric provided is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This is a 2-dimensional metric defined on the domain \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), which corresponds to a disk of radius 2 in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. The metric is conformally flat, meaning it is a conformal transformation of the flat Euclidean metric. The conformal factor is \(g(x, y) = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\).

To compute the area of the surface described by this metric, we use the area element in 2D, which is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy.
\]

For a diagonal metric \(ds^2 = g(dx^2 + dy^2)\), the determinant of the metric tensor is \(g^2\), so \(\sqrt{\det g} = g\). Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The total area is obtained by integrating \(dA\) over the entire domain \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). Switching to polar coordinates (\(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\)), the integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The \(\theta\) integral evaluates to \(2\pi\), leaving:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \cdot \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To compute the radial integral \(\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr\), we use the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), which transforms the integral into:

\[
\int_4^0 \frac{-du/2}{u} = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

This integral diverges because \(\int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du\) approaches infinity as \(u \to 0\). Therefore, the total area \(A\) is infinite.

The metric describes a space with infinite area, consistent with the interpretation of the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic geometry, which is non-compact and has infinite extent. While a pseudosphere in 3D space is a finite area surface, the given metric does not directly represent a pseudosphere but rather a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area.

Thus, the area of the surface described by the metric is infinite.
