Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm. Let's see... I remember something about the Boltzmann equation and how it relates to the distribution of energy levels in atoms, especially in stellar atmospheres under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

Alright, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I need to find the correct equation relating their temperatures T1 and T2.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation is about the population of energy states. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Here, E_i and E_j are the energies of the states, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the two energy levels differ by ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Let's say the excited state is level i and the lower is j. So the ratio n_i / n_j would be (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). But wait, the problem says that in star_1, the excitation is twice as much as in star_2. So for star_1, n1_i / n1_j = 2 (assuming g_i/g_j is the same for both stars, which I think is a safe assumption since it's the same element and energy levels).

So for star_1: n1_i / n1_j = 2 = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: n2_i / n2_j = 1 (since it's half, because 2 in star_1 is twice star_2?) Wait, wait. Wait, the problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So I think the excitation ratio is (n_i1/n_j1) / (n_i2/n_j2) ) = 2. Or wait, perhaps the excitation is the same for each star, but star_1 has twice the number in that state.

Wait, no. The question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So n_i1 is twice n_i2? Or is it that the ratio n_i/n_j is twice as much? Because n_i is the number in the excited state, n_j in the lower. So for each star, the ratio is (n_i)/(n_j). So for star_1, (n_i1)/(n_j1) = 2 * (n_i2)/(n_j2).

Wait, that's probably how to interpret it. Because if star_1's ratio is twice star_2's ratio, then n_i1/n_j1 = 2 * (n_i2/n_j2). So, let's write that.

So ratio1 = 2 * ratio2.

Each ratio is given by (g_i/g_j) exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, but if the states are the same for both stars, then g_i and g_j are the same for both, right? Because it's the same transition. So the only thing that varies is the exponential term because it depends on T.

So for star_1: ratio1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

For star_2: ratio2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But ratio1 = 2 * ratio2.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So if in star_2, the ratio is R, then in star_1 it's 2R. That would make sense.

So, R1 = 2 R2.

But R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) and R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Because g_i/g_j is the same for both stars, right? So for each star, R = exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

So plugging in R1=2 R2,

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Hmm, let's take the natural logarithm of both sides to get rid of the exponents.

ln( exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) = ln( 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) )

Simplify each side. Left side is -ΔE/(k T1).

Right side: ln(2) + ln(exp(-ΔE/(k T2))) ) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2).

So,

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2).

Hmm, let's rearrange terms.

Bring the ΔE/(k T2) to the left:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2).

Factor out ΔE/k:

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2).

Let me write that again:

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2).

But wait, let's see: the term is [1/(T2) -1/(T1)] which is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So, substituting,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

But wait, is that correct? Let me compute:

[1/T2 -1/T1] = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Yes, that's correct. Because 1/T2 = T1/(T1 T2) and 1/T1 = T2/(T1 T2), so subtracting gives (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

But wait, the equation I have is:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2).

But wait, in our earlier steps, after moving the terms, we had:

ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2).

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the algebra.

Original equation after taking logs:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2).

Let me move the terms with T to one side.

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2).

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2).

Which again gives:

[ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Hmm, so we have:

(ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) = ln(2).

Wait, but ΔE/(k) is a term that includes the known energy difference. But the question is about the relation between T1 and T2, so perhaps we can express the equation without ΔE.

Wait, but all the options have ln(2) on the left, so perhaps the equation can be rearranged to express ln(2) in terms of (T1 - T2) and the product T1 T2.

Wait, but let's write:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE.

But without knowing the values of ΔE and k, perhaps the actual equation can be rearranged in terms of the temperatures.

Wait, but the options don't have ΔE or k in them. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me look again.

Wait, perhaps I should write the ratio of the two ratios. Let me think again.

Wait, the ratio for star_1 is R1 = n_i1 / n_j1 = (g_i/g_j) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

Similarly, for star_2, R2 = (g_i/g_j) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Given that R1 = 2 R2.

So,

(g_i/g_j) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 (g_i/g_j) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Ah, wait, I think I missed that the g_i/g_j is the same for both stars, so they can be canceled out.

So, exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Which brings us to the same equation as before.

Then, taking logs:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2).

Bringing terms with T to one side:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2).

Factor ΔE/k:

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2).

That's the same as before.

But (1/T2 - 1/T1) is equal to (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Hmm. But I'm trying to find an equation for ln(2) in terms of T1 and T2. So perhaps I can rearrange to isolate ln(2).

So,

ln(2) = [ ΔE/(k) ] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, but in the options, none of them have ΔE or k. That's confusing. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it differently. Let's think of the Boltzmann factor for each star.

The ratio for star 1: R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

For star 2: R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

The problem states that R1 = 2 R2.

So,

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Divide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k T2)):

exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) ] ) = 2.

Take the natural log:

[ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1)] = ln(2).

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2).

Which again gives the same equation.

Hmm, but looking at the options, the only option that has (T1 - T2) in the numerator and product T1 T2 in the denominator is option D or C.

Wait, let me look at the options:

Option D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

But wait, in our equation:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

But in the options, none of them include ΔE or k. So perhaps I'm missing a step.

Wait, but wait. The original equation after taking logs was:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2).

So,

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2).

But since the problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J, and Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K, so ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Ah! That's a crucial point. Because ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly the same as k (since k ≈ 1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE/(k) is 1. So,

ln(2) = (1) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2 ).

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So the correct answer should be option D.

To determine the relationship between the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of the two stars, we use the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population ratio of two energy levels in a system in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of the populations of two energy levels \( i \) and \( j \) is given by:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_i \) and \( g_j \) are the statistical weights of the states, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the problem states that the excitation ratio \( n_i/n_j \) is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2. This implies:

\[
\frac{n_{i1}}{n_{j1}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{i2}}{n_{j2}}.
\]

Assuming the statistical weights \( g_i/g_j \) are the same for both stars, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

The term \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Substituting this back into the equation:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Given that \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), the ratio \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \). Thus, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures is:
