Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about a diatomic molecule modeled with the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules have two atoms, X and Y in this case. The question is about what happens when a photon is absorbed, changing the molecule's state.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, maybe the ground state. They want to know the momentum of the photon needed to switch to the next lowest energy state. So, I guess the photon's energy has to match the energy difference between these states.

Let me jot down the given data:

Mass of X (Mx) = 20 amu
Mass of Y (My) = 2 amu
Bond length (R) = 2 angstroms
Angular frequency (ω) = 4e14 rad/s

Wait, the question is about the next state. In the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized and involve both rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state, which is n=0. To go to the next state, perhaps it's the next vibrational state (n=1), or maybe a higher rotational state within the same vibrational level?

Wait, but the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy" after absorption. I think that would imply the smallest possible energy increase, which would involve a transition to the next vibrational state, not a higher rotational state. Because rotational transitions usually require lower energy jumps than vibrational transitions, but wait, no, actually in quantum mechanics, the selection rules might require certain transitions. But the problem says the model is the non-rigid rotor model—wait, no, the quantum rotation-vibration model is a bit different. Hmm.

Wait, no, the non-rigid rotor model accounts for bond vibrations as well. So the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. So the energy of the system is E = E_rot + E_vib.

In the quantum mechanical treatment, these energies are quantized. The fundamental vibrational state is when the vibrational quantum number is n=0. The rotational quantum number is l=0 in the ground state.

If the molecule is in the fundamental state, which implies the lowest possible vibrational and rotational states. So to get to the next possible state with the lowest energy, would that be the next vibrational state (n=1, l=0), or a higher rotational state (n=0, l=1 or higher)?

But wait, the next state with the lowest possible energy—so the minimal energy increase. The vibrational energy levels have a much larger spacing than rotational ones. So moving from n=0 to n=1 would require a much higher energy than moving to a higher rotational state.

Wait, let me think. The energy spacing between vibrational states is on the order of the vibrational frequency: ΔE_vib ~ ℏω. While the rotational energy levels have spacing ΔE_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) ( (l+1)(l+2) - l(l+1) ) ) = (ħ²/(2I))(2l+2) )= (ħ² (2l+2))/(2I) )= (ħ² (l+1))/I.

But for the ground rotational state, l=0. So the next rotational state is l=1. Then ΔE_rot for l=1 is (ħ² (1+1)) / I = 2 ħ² / I.

But what's the value of ħ² / I? Let's compute that.

I is the moment of inertia. I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) 

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (22) amu = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ approximately 3.012e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = (3.012e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.012e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2048e-46 kg m².

Now, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is about 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ² is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ħ²/I = (1.112e-68) / (1.2048e-46) ≈ 9.23e-23 J.

But wait, what is the rotational energy spacing when l=0 to l=1?

ΔE_rot = (ħ² (l+1)) / I. So when l=0 to l=1, it's ( ħ² (1+1) ) / I = ħ² * 2 / I.

Wait, actually the energy for rotational state l is E_rot = (ħ² l(l+1) )/(2I). So the difference between l and l+1 is E_rot(l+1) - E_rot(l) = (ħ² ( (l+1)(l+2) - l(l+1) )) )/(2I) ) = ( ħ² (2l + 2) )/(2I) ) = ( ħ² (l+1) ) / I.

So for l=0 to l=1: ΔE_rot = (ħ² (0+1) ) / I = ħ²/(I) ≈ 9.23e-23 J.

But the vibrational energy difference ΔE_vib is ℏω. ω is 4e14 rad/s. So ΔE_vib = ℏ * ω = (1.05457e-34 J s) * (4e14 rad/s) ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

Wait, that's way larger than the rotational energy difference. So moving from n=0 to n=1 in vibration requires much more energy than moving from l=0 to l=1 in rotation.

So if the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, l=0), the next possible state with the lowest energy would be l=1, v=0. Because that transition requires less energy than going to v=1.

So the photon's energy must match the rotational transition.

So the energy of the photon must be equal to the rotational energy difference between l=0 and l=1.

Wait, but I thought that in rotation-vibration, the energy is a sum of rotational and vibrational. So in the ground state, it's v=0, l=0. The next state would have either v=0, l=1 or v=1, l=0.

Since ΔE_rot (v=0, l=1) is about 9.23e-23 J, and ΔE_vib (v=1, l=0) is about 4.218e-20 J, which is much larger. So the lower energy transition is the rotational one.

So the photon's energy should match the rotational transition, which is about 9.23e-23 J.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. The question says, the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we're looking for the next state with the lowest possible energy. So that would be the next state, which could be either a higher rotational state or a higher vibrational state. Since the rotational transition requires less energy, that's the next state. So the photon's energy should match this rotational transition.

But wait, I also remember that in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized, and the selection rules allow transitions where Δl = ±2. Wait, no, in rigid rotor, the rotational selection rule is Δl = ±2 for electric dipole transitions. But wait, if the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0), and you're exciting it to a higher rotational state, is that the same as the R and R' lines in rotational spectroscopy?

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. In pure rotational transitions (like in rigid rotor), the selection rule is Δl = ±2. So if the molecule is in l=0, it can go to l=2, not l=1. Because the transition from l=0 to l=1 is forbidden, but l=0 to l=2 is allowed. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, but the non-rigid rotor model also includes vibrational transitions. So perhaps the question is looking for a vibrational transition, but maybe it's a combination of rotation and vibration.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me approach it from the energy standpoint.

If the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, l=0), the next possible state after absorption is either v=1, l=0 or v=0, l=1 (if allowed). But if the selection rules don't allow l=0 to l=1 transitions, then the next state would have to be v=1, l=0, which is a much higher energy.

Alternatively, if the selection rules allow l=0 to l=1, then the photon energy is as we calculated earlier.

But I'm not certain about the selection rules here. In the rigid rotor model, the allowed transitions are Δl = ±2. So in that case, the transition from l=0 can only go to l=2. Hmm, but if that's the case, then the photon would have to provide the energy difference between l=0 and l=2.

Wait, but the question says it's the non-rigid rotor model, which allows for some vibration. So perhaps in that model, the rotational selection rules are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the transition is a vibrational one. But the energy for the vibrational transition is much higher than the rotational. So which one is the right approach?

Let me think about the problem statement again. The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model. So the energy levels are a combination of both. So E = E_rot + E_vib.

So the fundamental state is the lowest energy, which is v=0 and l=0. To find the next state, we need to find the state with the next higher energy. Since the rotational transition l=0 to l=1 is allowed (depending on selection rules), but perhaps in this model, it's allowed.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering a transition where both vibrational and rotational changes occur. Because sometimes, in such models, transitions can involve a change in both vibrational and rotational states.

But the question specifies that the photon is absorbed, moving the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the minimal energy needed would be the difference between the current state and the next possible state.

In terms of energy, the next state is the lowest possible higher energy state. So that would be the state with the smallest energy increment.

Comparing the energy gaps:

ΔE_rot (l=0 to l=1) = 9.23e-23 J
ΔE_vib (v=0 to v=1) = 4.218e-20 J

Since 9.23e-23 < 4.218e-20, the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy must match the rotational transition.

But wait, I'm assuming that the transition from l=0 to l=1 is allowed. If the selection rules don't allow that, then the next possible transition would be to l=2, which would have a higher energy difference.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the selection rules. For a rigid rotor, the selection rule for dipole transitions is Δl = ±2. So l=0 can't go to l=1, but can go to l=2. So the first allowed rotational transition is l=0 → l=2.

So that would make the energy difference ΔE_rot(l=0→2) = (ħ² (2+1) ) / I = 3 ħ² / I. Wait, no, because for l=2, the energy is E_rot = ħ² (2)(3) / (2I) = 3 ħ² / I. So the ΔE is (3ħ²/I) - (0) ) = 3ħ²/I ≈ 3 * 9.23e-23 J ≈ 2.77e-22 J.

But this is significantly higher than the vibrational transition ΔE_vib =4.218e-20 J. So in that case, the vibrational transition would have a higher energy than the rotational one. But the rotational energy difference for l=0→2 is 2.77e-22 J, which is lower than 4.218e-20 J. So the photon energy would need to match 2.77e-22 J for the rotational transition.

Wait, but that's getting a bit complicated. Let me think again about the problem statement. It says the molecule is in its fundamental state—so the lowest possible state, which is v=0, l=0.

The next state with the lowest possible energy would be either the next rotational state (l=2) or the next vibrational state (v=1), whichever has the smaller ΔE.

But if the rotational transition from l=0 to l=2 requires 2.77e-22 J, and the vibrational transition requires 4.218e-20 J, then the rotational transition is lower in energy. So the photon's energy should match the rotational transition.

But wait, this depends on whether the selection rules allow it. If the selection rules for the non-rigid rotor model allow for transitions where Δl = ±1, then the l=0→1 transition is allowed, and the energy is 9.23e-23 J, which is even lower than l=0→2. But I thought the rigid rotor model only allows Δl=±2.

Hmm, perhaps the non-rigid rotor model relaxes the selection rules. Alternatively, perhaps in this problem, we are ignoring selection rules and just considering possible transitions based on energy levels.

But the problem is a bit ambiguous. Let me try to proceed with the assumption that the allowed transition is the one that requires the least energy, which would be the rotational transition, either l=0→1 or l=0→2, depending on the selection rules.

Wait, but the question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which may allow for combinations of vibrational and rotational transitions. But the problem is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, not considering possible selection rules. So perhaps the problem is simply looking for the energy difference between the ground state and the next possible state, which is the next vibrational state.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me calculate the possible energy differences.

E = E_rot + E_vib.

In the fundamental state: v=0, l=0. E = 0 + 0 = 0? But that can't be right because both E_rot and E_vib have zero-point energies. Wait, no, in the ground state, the vibrational energy is (1/2) ℏω for n=0, and the rotational energy is (ħ² l(l+1)) / (2I) for l=0, which is 0. So the total energy is (1/2) ℏω.

Wait, no, wait. For the quantum harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are E_vib = (n + 1/2) ℏω, so n=0 gives E_vib = (1/2) ℏω.

The rotational energy is E_rot = ( ħ² l(l+1) ) / (2I). For l=0, E_rot = 0.

So, in the fundamental state (v=0, l=0), the total energy is (1/2) ℏω + 0.

The next state would be the one with the next higher energy. So either v=1, l=0: E = (3/2) ℏω + 0.

Or v=0, l=1: E = (1/2) ℏω + ( ħ² (1)(2) )/(2I)

Which of these is lower in energy?

Compute both:

ΔE_vib = (3/2 ℏω) - (1/2 ℏω) )= ℏω = 4.218e-20 J.

ΔE_rot for l=0→1 would be ( (1)(2) ħ² )/(2I) ) - 0 = (2 ħ²) / (2I) )= ħ²/I ≈9.23e-23 J.

So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the next state would be v=0, l=1, but if the selection rules allow it.

But if the selection rules for the non-rigid rotor model allow Δl=±1, then this is possible. If not, then the next possible is l=2, which has a higher ΔE.

But I'm not sure about the selection rules in this model. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a transition that involves both a vibrational and rotational change. But the question seems to suggest a single quantum transition, either vibrational or rotational.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a bit more straightforward. The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which combines both, but perhaps the energy levels are considered as a sum of the vibrational and rotational energies. So the next state with the lowest energy is the one with the smallest possible energy above the current state.

So the current state is E_initial = (1/2) ℏω.

The next possible state could be:

1. v=1, l=0: E = (3/2) ℏω. ΔE = ℏω.

2. v=0, l=1: E = (1/2) ℏω + ( ħ² * 2 )/(2I ) = (1/2) ℏω + ħ²/I. ΔE = ħ²/I.

So which is smaller, ℏω or ħ²/I?

Given the numbers:

ℏω = (1.05457e-34 Js) * (4e14 rad/s) ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

ħ²/I ≈9.23e-23 J.

So ħ²/I is smaller. So the next state would require a photon with energy 9.23e-23 J.

But wait, because the selection rules may not allow the transition from l=0 to l=1, but the problem doesn't specify any selection rules, so perhaps we can proceed with the calculation.

So the photon's energy is E_photon = ħ²/I =9.23e-23 J.

But the question asks for the momentum of the photon. Hmm, photons have energy E = pc, where p is momentum and c is the speed of light.

So p = E / c.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.23e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.077e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but wait, the options given are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28. My calculation gives something about 3e-31, which is much smaller.

Wait a minute, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating ħ²/I.

Wait, let's re-calculate I.

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 + 2 amu) ) = 40/(22) amu ≈1.818 amu.

1 amu is 1.66e-27 kg. So μ ≈1.818 * 1.66e-27 ≈3.01e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

I = μ R² =3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.01e-27 *4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m².

Then, ħ² is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

So ħ² /I = 1.112e-68 / 1.204e-46 ≈9.23e-23 J. That's okay.

So energy of the photon is 9.23e-23 J.

Then, the momentum p is E/c.

c is 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.23e-23 /3e8 = 3.077e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but the options are way larger. The options are 1e-27 to 2e-27.

Hmm, this suggests that my reasoning is incorrect. There's a mistake somewhere.

Let me think again: perhaps the transition is not a rotational one but a vibrational one. Maybe I should have considered the vibrational energy.

Wait, if the transition is a vibrational one, then the energy is ℏω. So E_photon = ℏω.

Then, p = E/c = (ℏω)/c.

Let me compute that.

ℏ = 1.05457e-34 Js.

ω =4e14 rad/s.

So E_photon= (1.05457e-34)(4e14) =4.218e-20 J.

p =4.218e-20 /3e8 ≈1.406e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 1.4e-28.

Option C:1.1e-27.

Hmm, 1.4e-28 is option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought the rotational transition requires less energy. But perhaps in this problem, the transition is vibrational because the rotational transition isn't allowed or because the question considers only vibrational transitions.

Wait, but the problem statement says it's the quantum rotation-vibration model. So perhaps the model includes both, but the fundamental state is the lowest, and the next state is the next vibrational state.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the question again.

The question is: If the molecule is in its fundamental state, what momentum should an absorbed photon have to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?

Wait, the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next possible state is the state with the least energy higher than the current state.

In that case, the minimal ΔE is the rotational transition (if allowed), but if it's not allowed, then the vibrational transition.

But perhaps the problem is considering only vibrational transitions. Because the options match the vibrational calculation.

Wait, in the first approach, the rotational transition gave a much smaller p, but that doesn't match any of the options. Vibrational gives p=1.4e-28, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the rotational model. Let me re-examine the rotational energy.

In the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are E_rot = (ħ² l(l+1))/(2I).

So for l=0, E=0.

For l=1, E_rot = (ħ² * 2)/(2I) ) = ħ²/(I) ≈9.23e-23 J.

So the change is ΔE_rot =9.23e-23 J.

But this leads to p=3e-31 kg m/s, which isn't among the options.

But the vibrational transition, ΔE_vib=4.218e-20 J, leads to p=1.4e-28 Ns (since 1 Ns is kg m/s), which is option D.

So perhaps the correct approach is to consider a vibrational transition.

Wait, but why would that be? Because the rotational energy is much lower, but perhaps the selection rules don't allow the transition from l=0 to l=1, so the next allowed is l=2, which requires higher energy.

Wait, but if the selection rules don't allow l=0→1, then the next allowed rotational state is l=2.

So the ΔE_rot (l=0→2) is E_rot(2) - E_rot(0) = ( (ħ² * 2*3 )/(2I) ) - 0 )= (6 ħ² )/(4I) )? Wait, no.

Wait, no. E_rot for l=2 is (ħ² * 2*(2+1) )/(2I) )= (6 ħ² )/(2I) = 3 ħ²/(I) ≈27.69e-23 J.

So ΔE_rot(l=0→2)=3 *9.23e-23 ≈2.769e-22 J.

Which is higher than the vibrational ΔE of 4.218e-20 J.

Wait, but that's not correct. 2.769e-22 is less than 4.218e-20.

So the rotational transition l=0→2 would require 2.769e-22 J, which is less than the vibrational transition.

So why is the photon's momentum not matching that?

But none of the options are around 1e-31 kg m/s. So perhaps the problem assumes that the selection rules allow l=0→2 and the photon's energy is 2.769e-22 J, but that doesn't match any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the transition to the next vibrational state, which gives a much higher energy but a momentum that matches one of the options.

Looking back, the options are:

A) 1.9e-28
B) 2.3e-27
C) 1.1e-27
D)1.4e-28

So when I calculated the vibrational transition, I got p=1.4e-28, which is option D. That's one of the options.

But earlier, the rotational transition (assuming allowed) requires less energy, but the momentum would be 3e-31, which isn't an option.

So perhaps the problem is expecting the answer to be the vibrational transition, and the options are constructed that way.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the transition to the next state in the rotational-vibrational spectrum, which is a combination of both. But that would complicate the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the next state has both a vibrational and rotational change. For example, v=1 and l=1. But that would have a higher energy than both individual transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply expecting me to calculate the vibrational energy and not considering the rotational part.

Wait, another approach: the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the minimal energy required.

So, between the rotational and vibrational transitions, the rotational requires less energy. But the problem is that the selection rules might not allow it.

Given that, perhaps the answer is the vibrational transition, leading to option D:1.4e-28.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the rotational transition with l=0→1, and the calculation is correct, but the options have a mistake. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation for the rotational transition's momentum.

E_rot=9.23e-23 J.

p= E/c =9.23e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s ≈3.07e-31 N s.

But the options are way larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I computed something.

Wait, perhaps I confused ergs with joules or something else. Let me think about the units.

No, I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the next vibrational state, which requires the photon energy ℏω, leading to p=1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

So, given the options, and the calculations, I think the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition a diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy levels of the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in the fundamental state, which corresponds to the lowest vibrational state (\(v=0\)) and the lowest rotational state (\(l=0\)). The next state with the lowest energy could involve either a vibrational transition (\(v=1\), \(l=0\)) or a rotational transition (\(l=0 \to l=1\) or \(l=0 \to l=2\)), depending on the selection rules.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Vibrational Transition (\(v=0 \to v=1\)):**
   The energy difference for a vibrational transition is given by:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega
   \]
   Substituting \(\hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{Js}\) and \(\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\):
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \times (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
   \]
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \(p = \frac{E}{c}\), where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\):
   \[
   p = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}
   \]

2. **Rotational Transition (\(l=0 \to l=1\)):**
   The rotational energy levels are quantized as:
   \[
   E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2 l(l+1)}{2I}
   \]
   For \(l=0\), \(E_{\text{rot}} = 0\). For \(l=1\), the energy difference is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2 (1)(2)}{2I}
   \]
   The moment of inertia \(I\) is calculated as:
   \[
   I = \mu R^2, \quad \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y}
   \]
   Substituting \(M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}\), \(M_y = 2 \, \text{amu}\), and \(R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\):
   \[
   \mu = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu} = 1.818 \times 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.012 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
   \]
   \[
   I = (3.012 \times 10^{-27}) \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.204 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \, \text{m}^2
   \]
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2 \times 2}{2 \times 1.204 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.23 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]
   The corresponding momentum is:
   \[
   p = \frac{9.23 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.077 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}
   \]

3. **Comparison of Transitions:**
   - The vibrational transition requires \(\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}\), leading to \(p \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}\).
   - The rotational transition (\(l=0 \to l=1\)) requires \(\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.23 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), leading to \(p \approx 3.077 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}\).
   - However, the rotational selection rules for a rigid rotor model typically allow \(\Delta l = \pm 2\), meaning the next allowed rotational transition is \(l=0 \to l=2\), which has a higher energy difference:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2 (2)(3)}{2I} = \frac{\hbar^2 (6)}{2I} \approx 2.769 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{J}
     \]
     This corresponds to a momentum:
     \[
     p = \frac{2.769 \times 10^{-22}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 9.23 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}
     \]
   - Despite the rotational transition requiring less energy, the calculated momentum does not match any of the provided options. Therefore, the problem likely assumes a vibrational transition.

### Conclusion:
The momentum of the photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy is consistent with the vibrational transition, corresponding to **Option D**.
