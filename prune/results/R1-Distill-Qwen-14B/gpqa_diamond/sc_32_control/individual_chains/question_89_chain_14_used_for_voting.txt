Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's take it step by step.

The question involves several reactions leading to a product, and then determining the coupling pattern in the NMR of the final product. Let me break down each part.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating it with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically E2, forming an alkene. So, dibromoadamantane should form an adamantylene.

The product 1 has an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That peak is probably a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, but elimination should form an alkene. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing something up. Oh no, wait, KOH is a base but maybe in this case, it's a dehydrohalogenation to form the double bond. But the IR suggests a carbonyl, which is a C=O. Hmm. So maybe I'm missing a step.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is a dehydrohalogenation (elimination) to form an alkene, but then perhaps another reaction happens. Wait, KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. If it's a dihalide, perhaps it's a double elimination to form a diene or an alkyne? No, but wait, maybe it's a diels-alder type situation. Hmm, or perhaps it's more about a substitution reaction.

Wait, another thought: If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with a strong base like KOH, perhaps it's an example of the formation of an epoxide. But no, epoxides are usually formed with peracids or other oxidizing agents. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination to form a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the reactions. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is subjected to KOH, which might cause a dehydrohalogenation. But since it's a vicinal dihalide, elimination would form a double bond. So, product 1 would be adamantylene (that's the structure with a double bond in the adamantane framework). But then why does the IR show 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a carbonyl?

Oh wait, maybe the initial elimination is followed by an oxidation. Wait, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the elimination forms a carbonyl via some mechanism. Or perhaps I'm mistaken about the first reaction.

Wait, another approach: The product after KOH is a light yellow solid. Maybe it's an epoxide. No, because the IR for an epoxide would show different peaks, not a carbonyl. Alternatively, another possibility: Maybe the KOH causes a substitution. Wait, but with two bromines adjacent, perhaps a 1,2-diol is formed through substitution, but that wouldn't give a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the product is adamantane-1,3-diol. But that doesn't fit with the IR. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me look at the NMR data for product 1. The 1H NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). Let's think about what this could be.

4.79 ppm is upfield for an alcohol proton. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether or an epoxide. Wait, 4.79 could be an OCH2 group. For example, in an epoxide, the protons are deshielded and appear around 3-4 ppm. So maybe not an epoxide.

Alternatively, if it's a carbonyl, perhaps the product is a ketone. Let's think: if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH causes elimination, but perhaps in a different way. Oh wait, could it be a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? No, because that's usually with ketones and peracids.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is dehydrohalogenation to form a diene? No, but the IR would then show C=C peaks around 1650 cm⁻¹, not 1720. So 1720 is more likely a carbonyl, like a ketone or an ester.

Wait, if the product is a ketone, perhaps it's an epoxide that's opened into something else. Hmm, I'm confused.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone. Let's think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, perhaps undergoes a double dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene and lose two HBr molecules, but then that would form a conjugated diene, not a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps elimination forms an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is more about ring-opening. Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure with a four-membered ring bridge. When 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps the bromides are eliminated to form a carbonyl group. Let me think of the structure: Adamantane is a cage structure, so 1,3 positions are adjacent on the same face. Eliminating HBr from each would form a double bond, but perhaps in this case, the elimination leads to a carbonyl group. Wait, maybe it's a case of dihalide elimination via a E2 mechanism, but forming an alkene. But why a carbonyl then?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe product 1 isn't the result of elimination but substitution. If KOH were in a non-polar solvent, elimination is favored, but if in a polar solvent, substitution could happen. The question says excess KOH, which is a strong base, so elimination is more likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol. No, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, another angle. The IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl, like a ketone or an ester. So product 1 must be a ketone. How can 1,3-dibromoadamantane form a ketone upon treatment with KOH?

Wait, maybe KOH is acting as a base, causing the formation of a carbonyl group via dehydrohalogenation. But I'm not sure about that mechanism.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, but not just forming a double bond. Wait, perhaps the two adjacent Br atoms are eliminated, forming a triple bond? But that would require more extreme conditions, and the IR would show a C≡C stretch around 2100 cm⁻¹, which isn't mentioned.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is a ketone. Wait, how? Maybe the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane allows for an elimination that forms a carbonyl. So, if two HBr molecules are eliminated, perhaps via a mechanism where the two bromines are adjacent and their elimination forms a conjugated system that includes a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that upon elimination, a bridgehead carbonyl is formed. Let me visualize the structure of adamantane: It's a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent bridgeheads. So if each has a Br, eliminating two HBr would form a bridgehead double bond. But how would that produce a carbonyl?

Wait, maybe the elimination isn't just forming a double bond but instead, the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and their elimination leads to a carbonyl group. Oh, wait! Maybe it's a case of forming a carbonyl via elimination of two equivalents of HBr. For example, in a vicinal dihalide, two elimination steps could form the carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: The base (KOH) could abstract a beta-hydrogen, leading to the departure of Br⁻, forming a double bond between the two bridgeheads. But that alone doesn't form a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the product is a ketone, and the IR is correct. So what is the structure of product 1? Let's think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm peak is a doublet for 2H. That could be an OCH2 group or perhaps a CH2 next to an oxygen.

Wait, in the NMR, 4.79 ppm for 2H could be a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, such as in a hemiacetal or an ether. But considering the IR, it's a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone with adjacent protons. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is due to an epoxide.

Wait, wait, another thought: If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps the structure is a bridgehead ketone. For example, 1,3-diketone? No, but the IR would show a strong peak at around 1720, which fits a ketone.

Wait, but in the case of 1,3-dibromoadamantane, elimination of HBr from each bridgehead would lead to a bridgehead double bond. But bridgehead double bonds are not usually possible due to Bredt's rule, which says that bridgehead double bonds are not stable in small bridged systems. So that would not be possible. Therefore, perhaps the elimination leads to a conjugated diene elsewhere in the structure.

Wait, but I'm stuck on the IR. Maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination but something else. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH. Another possibility is a substitution reaction where the two Br atoms are replaced by something else. But KOH is a base and a strong nucleophile. If it's a substitution, perhaps the product is a diol, but the IR doesn't fit that.

Wait, but the product 1 is a light yellow solid. Maybe it's a cyclic ether. If KOH is a base, perhaps it's deprotonating and causing a ring-opening or some rearrangement. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the initial reaction forms a carbonyl via a different pathway. For example, perhaps a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but I don't see an oxidizing agent here. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a neighboring group effect that leads to the formation of a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diketone. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the NMR again. The integration is 2H at 4.79, which could be a CH2 near an oxygen. Then 10H around 2.4-2.23, which might be bridgehead CH2 groups or similar. The 1.94 ppm 2H could be another CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but again, the IR doesn't fit. Wait, another angle: 1,3-dibromoadamantane could form an epoxide upon treatment with a base. But I'm not familiar with that exact reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination scenario, but that usually involves amines.

Wait, maybe the first step isn't elimination but something else. Another approach: Let's think about the subsequent steps.

Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(iPr)3), which is a Lewis acid catalyst often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 is a ketone, perhaps, so maybe it undergoes some kind of acylation. Or if product 1 is an epoxide, then Al(iPr)3 might catalyze ring-opening.

Wait, but product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with Al(iPr)3. If product 1 is a ketone, maybe Al(iPr)3 isn't doing much. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and Al(iPr)3 is used to open it.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and Al(iPr)3 is used in a dehydration step. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alkene, and Al(iPr)3 is used in a polymerization or some other reaction, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the next steps. After product 1 is treated with Al(iPr)3, product 2 is formed. Then, ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, giving product 3.

Ozonolysis is usually used to cleave alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So product 2 must have a double bond that, upon ozonolysis, forms carbonyl groups.

So, product 2 must be an alkene. Therefore, product 1, upon treatment with Al(iPr)3, must form an alkene. So, perhaps product 1 is a carbonyl compound, and Al(iPr)3 is used for some kind of alkylation.

Wait, wait. Maybe product 1 is a ketone, and Al(iPr)3 is used to induce a Aldol condensation or some kind of elimination to form a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and the Al(iPr)3 induces dehydration to form a double bond.

But let me go back. Product 1's NMR has 4.79 ppm for 2H. If it's a diol, those might be -OCH2O- groups, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps those are -OCH2- groups adjacent to oxygen.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a cyclic ether, like a four-membered ring. Let me think: Adamantane has rigid structures, so a four-membered ring ether would have protons around 3-4 ppm. The 4.79 might be for such an ether.

Wait, another thought: If product 1 is a diol, perhaps the hydroxyl protons would appear around 1-5 ppm, but in D2O they might exchange and not appear. But the question says to exclude exchanging protons, so maybe the 4.79 is not an OH group.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone with an adjacent CH2O group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of the overall process.

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with IR at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a carbonyl) upon treatment with KOH.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, perhaps 1,3-adamantanedione. But how? Maybe the elimination of two HBr molecules leads to two carbonyl groups? Or perhaps one.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination. Each Br leaves, and two H's are taken, producing two carbonyl groups. Hmm, but that would require two eliminations from adjacent carbons, which could form either a double bond or a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a single carbonyl group. For example, the loss of one HBr would form a double bond, but then perhaps some rearrangement occurs.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Let's proceed despite the confusion.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, such as 1-adamantane-3-one. Then, product 2 is formed by treatment with Al(iPr)3. Since Al(iPr)3 is a Lewis acid, maybe it's used to catalyze some kind of enolization or alkylation.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an enol ether, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the initial reaction is a substitution of both Br atoms with OH groups, forming a diol. Then, when treated with Al(iPr)3, which is a strong Lewis acid, it could dehydrate the diol to form a double bond.

So, product 1 would be 1,3-adamantanediol. Then, product 2 would be 1,3-adamantadiene, or perhaps a more substituted alkene.

If product 2 is an alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl compounds. So, product 3 would be a dialdehyde or similar.

Now, the NMR of product 3 is the target. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange.

In ozonolysis, the alkene is cleaved, and each carbonyl group would be attached to the adjacent carbons. Wait, but ozonolysis tends to break the double bond and form carbonyls. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups, and the adjacent protons would be next to them.

So, imagine the ozonolysis of an alkene. Each R group attached to the double bond becomes RCHO (if it's a terminal alkene) or a ketone.

Wait, let's model this. Suppose product 2 is a diene, say, 1,3-diene in the adamantane structure. Ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyls.

Wait, but if product 2 is a single double bond, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is 1,3-adamantadiene, ozonolysis would break into two fragments. But adamantane is a rigid structure, so maybe the double bond is in a bridge position.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 has a single double bond.

Wait, perhaps the initial elimination forms an alkene, and then product 1 is the alkene. But no, because the IR of product 1 shows a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to outline the possibilities again.

Reaction 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid, IR 1720 cm⁻¹, NMR as given)

Reaction 2: product 1 + Al(iPr)3 → product 2

Reaction 3: product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3

Assuming that product 2 is an alkene, because ozonolysis targets alkenes.

So, product 1 must have a structure that, when treated with Al(iPr)3, forms an alkene. So, perhaps product 1 is a diol, which upon treatment with Al(iPr)3 (a Lewis acid) undergoes dehydration to form an alkene. So, product 2 is an alkene.

So, product 1 would be 1,3-adamantanediol. Then, product 2 is 1,3-adamantadiene or similar.

Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bond to form two carbonyl groups.

So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups attached to the adamantane framework.

Now, the NMR of product 3: the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen.

The most deshielded protons would be those adjacent to the carbonyl groups, because they are in an electron-deficient environment, making them more deshielded.

In an ozonolysis product, each carbonyl group is connected to a CH2 group (if the alkene was between CH2 groups). So, the protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be deshielded.

In the ozonolysis of a simple alkene like ethylene, you get two aldehydes. But in a more complex structure like adamantane, the cleavage would form more complex structures.

Assuming the alkene in product 2 is between two CH2 groups, then ozonolysis would produce two aldehyde groups adjacent to those CH2 groups.

Wait, but in the case of ozonolysis, each carbonyl would be attached to the structure where the double bond was. So, if the double bond was between C1 and C3, then product 3 would have carbonyl groups at those positions.

But considering the adamantane structure, perhaps each end of the double bond is connected to a CH2 group.

Assuming that, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl (on the CH2 groups) would have specific coupling patterns.

In the NMR, each of these protons would be next to the carbonyl, and their coupling would depend on neighboring protons.

In a typical scenario, each CH2 next to a carbonyl would have two protons. These protons would be split by neighboring CH2 groups. For example, if each CH2 is next to another CH2, the coupling would be multiplet.

Wait, more specifically, each CH2 next to the carbonyl would have neighboring groups. Let's model it.

Suppose we have a structure like R–CH₂–CHO. The CH₂ group next to the aldehyde would have two protons. Each of these protons would be adjacent to the aldehyde proton (but aldehydes are usually deshielded and appear around 9-10 ppm, so their protons don't show in the 1H NMR if they're exchanged, as the problem states to exclude exchanging protons).

Wait, but in the ozonolysis product, the carbonyl is part of the structure. Let me think about the splitting.

If the CH2 is next to the carbonyl, the two protons on the CH2 would be split by neighboring groups. For example, if each of those CH2 groups is adjacent to another CH2 group, the protons would couple with the neighboring group's protons.

Assuming the structure is such that each CH2 is next to another CH2 group (like in a chain), the protons would be split into a triplet of triplets or similar.

Wait, but if each CH2 has two neighboring protons on each adjacent CH2, each proton would have coupling with two different sets of protons.

Wait, perhaps each proton on the CH2 next to the carbonyl is coupled to two neighboring groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is a triplet of triplets. For example, each proton is coupled to two different sets of two protons each, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But let me think in terms of splitting patterns. Imagine a CH2 group next to another CH2 group. Each proton in the first CH2 would couple with the two protons in the adjacent CH2. This would result in a triplet for each proton, but because each proton is coupled to two equivalent protons, it would be a triplet.

Wait, no, the splitting would be a triplet for each coupling. But if a proton is coupled to two different sets of protons, each with the same coupling constant, the pattern becomes more complex.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 next to the carbonyl is adjacent to two different sets of protons. For example, each CH2 is next to another CH2 group and perhaps another set of protons from the adamantane structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 groups are in a bridgehead position, making their coupling more complex.

Wait, considering the adamantane structure, each bridgehead is connected to several other CH2 groups. So, the protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be coupled with adjacent bridgehead protons.

But I'm not entirely sure about the exact structure.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 group is adjacent to two other CH groups, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, another approach: In the ozonolysis product, the most deshielded protons are those closest to the carbonyl groups. These protons are likely to be on CH2 groups adjacent to carbonyls.

Each of these protons would be split by neighboring groups. If each CH2 group has two neighboring groups (like two CH2 groups on either side), each with two protons, then each proton would have coupling with two sets of protons.

So, each proton would experience two different coupling constants. For example, coupling with J1 and J2, leading to a doublet of doublets. But depending on the structure, it could be more complex.

Wait, but if each CH2 group is next to two other CH2 groups, each with two protons, then each proton would have coupling from two neighboring groups, each with two protons. So, the splitting would be a triplet from each coupling, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but each CH2 proton is adjacent to two protons on each neighboring CH2 group. Wait, perhaps each CH2 is next to two other CH2 groups, each with two protons. So each proton would have two neighboring protons from each adjacent CH2, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 group is next to one CH2 group on one side and a single CH group on the other. Then, the coupling would be from different J values, leading to a triplet of triplets.

I'm not entirely confident, but let's think about the options given.

The options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

So, which is more likely.

If the most deshielded proton is on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to two other CH2 groups, each with their own protons, then each proton would have coupling to two sets of two protons each. So, each proton would be split by two neighboring groups, each with two protons, leading to a triplet for each coupling. Since the two couplings are independent, the overall pattern would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the coupling is to one adjacent CH2 group with two protons, and another group with a different coupling, perhaps leading to a triplet of triplets.

Another possibility is that each CH2 group is next to another CH2 group, leading to a triplet. But if there's another coupling from a different group, it can split into a more complex pattern.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 groups are part of a bridge, leading each CH2 to be adjacent to two other CH2 groups, each with two protons. That would cause each proton to have coupling to four protons, but in reality, it's more likely that each CH2 is adjacent to a single CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

Wait, perhaps each CH2 is adjacent to a single CH2 group. So, each proton is split into a triplet (coupled with two protons from the adjacent CH2). But if there's another coupling, like to a bridgehead proton, it could become a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 group is part of a bridge and is coupled to two different sets of protons, each with two protons, leading to a triplet of triplets.

I'm not entirely confident, but based on the options, the most likely coupling pattern for the most deshielded proton would be a triplet of triplets, as each proton would be coupling with two different sets of two protons each.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH**  
   - The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O).  
   - The ¹H NMR spectrum of product 1 includes a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which suggests a methylene group (CH₂) adjacent to an electronegative group, likely oxygen.  
   - Based on the IR and NMR data, product 1 is identified as 1-adamantane-3-one, a ketone.  

2. **Reaction 2: Heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide (Al(iPr)₃)**  
   - Al(iPr)₃, a Lewis acid, likely facilitates the dehydration of product 1 to form an alkene.  
   - Product 2 is therefore an alkene, likely 1,3-adamantadiene, which has a double bond in the adamantane framework.  

3. **Reaction 3: Ozonolysis of product 2**  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming two carbonyl groups.  
   - Product 3 is a compound with carbonyl groups at the positions where the double bond was cleaved. The most deshielded protons in product 3 are adjacent to these carbonyl groups.  

4. **Coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in product 3**  
   - The most deshielded protons are on CH₂ groups adjacent to carbonyl groups.  
   - These protons are coupled to neighboring protons, including those on adjacent CH₂ groups.  
   - Each proton on the CH₂ group is coupled to two sets of protons, leading to a splitting pattern of a triplet of triplets.  

**Conclusion:** The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is a triplet of triplets.
