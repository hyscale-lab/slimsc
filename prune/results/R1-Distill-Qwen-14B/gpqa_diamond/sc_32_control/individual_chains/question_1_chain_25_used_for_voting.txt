Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A to D, each with different exponents of 10 in eV.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The basic idea is that you can't precisely know both the energy and the lifetime of a particle simultaneously. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But for this problem, I think we can use the approximation ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ.

Wait, but how does this apply to the energy difference? Oh, because the lifetimes given are the lifetimes of each state, and we need to find the minimum energy difference needed for them to be distinguishable. So, the uncertainty in energy for each state would be approximately ħ/(Δt). But wait, since these are two different states, maybe we should consider the energy difference between them.

Let me think: For two states to be distinguishable, their energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is too small, the uncertainty might make it hard to tell them apart. So the energy difference ΔE should be larger than the uncertainty for each state.

Alternatively, perhaps the product of the energy difference and the time of observation (or the lifetime) should be around ħ. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to structure this.

The uncertainty principle equation is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. But for each state, the lifetime is Δt. So the uncertainty in energy for each state is approximately ħ/(2Δt). But since we have two states with different lifetimes, their uncertainties would be different. Hmm, wait, but the energy difference between them has to be such that it's above the sum of the uncertainties, perhaps?

Wait, no. Wait a second, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state and then ensure that the energy difference is larger than the sum of these uncertainties. Because if each state has an uncertainty, the difference needs to be more than that to be noticeable.

Wait, let me think again. Let's say the two states have energies E1 and E2. The actual energy might be somewhere within the uncertainty. For them to be distinguishable, the separation between E1 and E2 must be larger than the uncertainty in each of them. So, ΔE >= (uncertainty in E1) + (uncertainty in E2).

But wait, each state has its own Δt. So the uncertainty in E1 would be ħ/(2Δt1), and for E2 it's ħ/(2Δt2). So the minimal ΔE is the sum of these two uncertainties.

Wait, but the problem states that the lifetimes are 1e-9 and 1e-8 seconds. So, let's calculate the uncertainties for each.

First, let's compute ħ. I remember that Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s.

But since the options are in electron volts, I should convert ħ into eV·s. I know that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So:

ħ ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s = 1.05457e-34 (eV·s * 1.602e-19 J/eV) ) → Wait, no. Wait, 1 J = 1 (kg·m²/s²), but I think it's easier to just convert ħ to eV·s.

So, 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 1 J = 1/(1.602e-19) eV ≈ 6.242e18 eV.

So, ħ = 1.05457e-34 J·s = (1.05457e-34 J·s) * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) ) → Let me compute that.

So, (1.05457e-34) / (1.602e-19) ) = approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s. Because 1.05457e-34 / 1.602e-19 = (1.05457 / 1.602) * 1e-15 ≈ 0.658 * 1e-15, which is 6.58e-16.

So, ħ ≈ 6.58e-16 eV·s.

Now, the uncertainty in energy for each state is ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt). Let's compute that.

For the first state with Δt1 = 1e-9 s:
ΔE1 = (6.58e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = (6.58e-16)/(2e-9) ) eV.

Compute that: 6.58e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.58 / 2) * 1e-7 = 3.29e-7 eV ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

For the second state with Δt2 =1e-8 s:
ΔE2 = (6.58e-16) / (2e-8) ) = 6.58e-16 / 2e-8 = (6.58/2) * 1e-8 = 3.29e-8 eV.

So, the uncertainty in energy for E1 is ~3.29e-7 eV, and for E2 it's ~3.29e-8 eV.

Wait, but wait, each state's energy isn't E, but it's the energy uncertainty. So the two states' energies may have uncertainties. The total uncertainty when considering both would be the sum?

Or perhaps when the energy difference between the two states is more than the sum of the uncertainty in each, then they can be resolved.

Wait, so the minimal ΔE needed is the sum of ΔE1 and ΔE2.

ΔE_min = ΔE1 + ΔE2 = (3.29e-7) + (3.29e-8) = Approximately 3.619e-7 eV.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of the options are close to that. The options are:

A) 1e-9 eV
B)1e-11 eV
C)1e-4 eV
D)1e-8 eV.

Hmm, 3.6e-7 is 3.6e-7 eV, which is 3.6 x 10^-7 eV. But the options don't have that. Wait, what am I doing wrong here?

Wait, perhaps I got the approach wrong. Maybe the correct approach is to find the energy difference based on the lifetimes, and the energy difference must be such that the corresponding photon emitted would have a frequency that can be measured, given the lifetimes.

Wait, another approach: The energy difference between the two states must be such that the corresponding photon's frequency is detectable, which would require the lifetime to be longer than the oscillation period. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be such that the time it takes for the phase to change (like in emission) is longer than the coherence time, which is the lifetime.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference ΔE must satisfy ΔE * τ >= ħ, where τ is the lifetime. Because the uncertainty in time is τ. Wait, so for each state, the uncertainty in energy is about ħ/τ.

Wait, but to resolve two states, the energy difference must be at least the sum of their individual uncertainties, so ΔE >= ħ/τ1 + ħ/τ2.

Wait, but wait, let's calculate that.

So, ΔE >= (ħ/τ1) + (ħ/τ2).

We have τ1 = 1e-9 s, τ2 = 1e-8 s.

So, let's compute each term.

For τ1:

ħ/(τ1) = 6.58e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.58e-7 eV.

For τ2:

ħ/(τ2) =6.58e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.58e-8 eV.

So sum is 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 ≈ 7.238e-7 eV.

But looking at the options, the closest is option C: 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001, which is way larger than 7e-7.

Wait, but that would mean that even option C is much larger than the required ΔE. So why is it an option?

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the formula. Another approach: Perhaps the energy difference should be such that the lifetime multiplied by the energy difference is of the order of ħ. Because E * t ≈ ħ.

Wait, let me think. The energy-time uncertainty is ΔE Δt ~ ħ/2. So, if we have a time window (like observation time) of t, then the energy resolution is ~ ħ/t.

But in this case, each state has its own lifetime. So perhaps the energy difference should be on the order of ħ divided by the smaller of the two lifetimes.

Wait, the smaller lifetime is 1e-9 s. So ΔE = ħ/(1e-9) = 6.58e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.58e-7 eV.

But that's 6.58e-7 eV, which is 6.58e-7 eV. Again, none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The energy difference must be such that the transition frequency is detectable. The transition frequency is ΔE/h. The time available is the lifetime, so the maximum frequency that can be detected is about 1/(2τ), so the energy difference should be at least h/(2τ). Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, the energy difference must be such that the time it takes for the state to evolve (like in Rabi oscillations) is longer than the coherence time, which is the lifetime.

Alternatively, another formula I've heard about is the energy resolution in spectroscopy: the resolving power R is given by R = ΔE / E, and also R is equal to the time of observation divided by the Planck constant. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the Fourier transform. The lifetime τ is the time over which the state is observed. The energy resolution is determined by the width of the Fourier transform, which is ~1/τ.

So, the energy uncertainty is ΔE ≈ 1/τ in units where ħ=1. But in our case, we have to include ħ.

Wait, perhaps ΔE ≈ ħ/(τ), so for each state, the energy uncertainty is about ħ/τ.

But I'm not sure whether for the two states, their energy uncertainties add when considering the difference. So the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties.

Wait, but let's compute that again.

ΔE_min = ħ/(τ1) + ħ/(τ2) = (6.58e-16 eV·s) * (1/(1e-9 s) + 1/(1e-8 s)) )

Which is 6.58e-16 * (1e9 + 1e8) = 6.58e-16 * 1.1e9 = 6.58 * 1.1e-7 eV.

Which is approximately 7.23e-7 eV.

Again, 7.23e-7 eV is 7.23e-7 eV, which is 723e-9 eV, or 0.723 nano-eV. Looking at the options, none of them match that. The options are 1e-9 (A), 1e-11 (B), 1e-4 (C), 1e-8 (D).

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: The energy difference must be such that the time for the energy to change is longer than the lifetime. Well, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the energy difference using the uncertainty principle for each state and then see which option is larger than the sum of the two.

Wait, for the first state, ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) = 6.58e-16/(2e-9) = 3.29e-7 eV.

For the second, ΔE2= 6.58e-16/(2e-8) )= 3.29e-8 eV.

So the sum is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.62e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be at least ~3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, none of them are near that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking about the energy difference between the two states, not the uncertainty. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the energy difference multiplied by the average lifetime is about ħ.

Wait, the average of τ1 and τ2 is (1e-9 +1e-8)/2 = 1.1e-8 / 2 = 5.5e-9 s.

So ΔE * average τ ≈ ħ → ΔE = ħ / (average τ) ≈ 6.58e-16 / (5.5e-9) ≈ 1.196e-7 eV.

Again, 1.2e-7 eV, which is 1.2e-7 eV. None of the options match this.

Wait, but let's compute the options given.

Option C is 1e-4 eV. That's 1e-4 eV, which is 100,000 times larger than our calculated 1e-7 eV. So if the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than the uncertainty, then it can be clearly resolved.

Wait, but why is that the case? Because if the energy difference is much larger than the uncertainty, they can be resolved. So the correct option is the one where ΔE is larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties (3.6e-7 eV). So option C, 1e-4 eV, is 1e-4 = 1e-4 eV, which is 100,000 times larger than 1e-7 eV.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, option C is the only one that's larger than 1e-7 eV. Let me check the options:

A:1e-9 → 0.001 * 1e-7 → smaller than required.

B:1e-11 → even smaller.

C:1e-4 → much bigger.

D:1e-8 → 0.1 *1e-7 → smaller.

So, the only option that's larger than the minimum required is option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the sum was ~3.6e-7, so option C (1e-4) is much larger, which would certainly allow the two states to be distinguishable.

So the correct answer would be option C.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) and the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) is approximately \( \hbar/2 \). For distinguishability, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) between the two states must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties in energy for each state.

The uncertainty in energy for each state is given by:

\[
\Delta E_i = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_i}
\]

where \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). Calculating for each state:

1. For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
   \]

2. For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
   \]

The total uncertainty is the sum of the individual uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 3.291 \times 10^{-7} + 3.291 \times 10^{-8} = 3.620 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

For the two states to be distinguishable, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must satisfy:
\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_{\text{total}} = 3.620 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is smaller than \( 3.620 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it cannot resolve the two states.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is also smaller than \( 3.620 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it cannot resolve the two states.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is much larger than \( 3.620 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it can clearly resolve the two states.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is smaller than \( 3.620 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it cannot resolve the two states.

Thus, the only option that satisfies the condition for distinguishability is **Option C**.
