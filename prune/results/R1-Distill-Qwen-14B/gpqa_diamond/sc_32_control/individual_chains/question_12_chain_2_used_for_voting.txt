Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles and their kinetic energy. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. The pion is at rest, and I need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles. The options are A to D, each with two values. 

Wait, right, the equation given is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Since the pion is stationary, its initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the total momentum should still be zero because momentum is conserved. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. 

But wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have such a tiny (almost zero) mass. I think for this problem, we can consider the neutrino's mass as negligible compared to the muon's. So the muon would carry away most of the momentum, while the neutrino's momentum would be much smaller. Hmm, but how does that affect the kinetic energy?

Let me think about the process. The pion is at rest, so its energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. When it decays, the total energy must be conserved. So the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino should equal the pion's rest energy.

But the muon and neutrino are moving, so their energies are their rest mass energies plus kinetic energy. Wait, but the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino's rest mass is almost zero, so its energy is just its kinetic energy plus a tiny bit (which we can ignore for this problem). 

Wait, but wait. Oh right, the neutrino's rest mass is considered zero in many cases, so its energy is purely kinetic. So the muon's energy would be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy.

So, let's break it down. The total energy before decay is 139.6 MeV. After decay:

Energy of muon (E_mu) = m_mu c² + K_mu
Energy of neutrino (E_nu) = K_nu

So, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV

But momentum is conserved, so the magnitudes of their momenta must be equal because they are moving in opposite directions. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|

The momentum of each particle is related to their energy and mass. For the muon, p = sqrt( (E_mu)^2 - (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c². But since neutrino's mass is zero, p_nu = E_nu / c.

Wait, but neutrino's momentum p_nu = E_nu / c. Because for massless particles, E = pc (since E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2, and m=0, so E=pc). 

So, since p_mu = p_nu, we have:

sqrt( E_mu^2 - (105.7)^2 ) = E_nu / c * c? Wait, maybe I should set up the equation properly.

Let me write the momentum equation:

p_mu = p_nu

But for the muon, p_mu = sqrt( (E_mu)^2 - (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c
Wait, actually, the formula is p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no, let's get this right.

The relativistic energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc)² c² + (m c²)^2. So, E² = p² c² + m² c^4.

So p = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / c² ?

Wait, maybe better to think in terms of units where c=1, but perhaps I should avoid confusion. Let me think in terms of units. Let's set c=1 for simplicity, since all masses are given in MeV/c², which will simplify things. So, E² = p² + m².

So, for the muon: E_mu² = p_mu² + m_mu^2
And for the neutrino: E_nu² = p_nu² + 0, since m=0.

But since p_mu = p_nu (because their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction), we can denote p_mu = p_nu = p.

So E_mu² = p^2 + (105.7)^2
E_nu = p, since E_nu^2 = p².

Now, the energy conservation equation is E_mu + E_nu = 139.6.

Substituting E_nu = p, and E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2), we get:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Hmm, this is an equation in terms of p. Let me solve for p.

Let me denote x = p for simplicity. So,

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6

Subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - x

Square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2

Expanding the right side:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*x + x^2

So,

x² + 105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 x

Now, compute 105.7^2 and 139.6^2.

105.7^2 = approx 11172.49 (since 100^2=10,000, 5.7^2=32.49, 2*100*5.7=1140, so 10000+1140+32.49 = 11172.49)

139.6^2: 139.6 * 139.6. Let's compute that.

Alternatively, 140^2 is 19600. But since it's 139.6, which is 140 - 0.4, so (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

Wait, wait, 140² is 19600. 0.4^2 is 0.16. 2ab is 2*140*0.4= 112. So 19600 -112=19488, plus 0.16 is 19488.16.

So,

105.7² = 11172.49
139.6² = 19488.16

So,

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 x

Rearranging,

2*139.6 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49

Calculate 19488.16 - 11172.49:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67

So,

2*139.6 x = 8315.67

2*139.6= 279.2

So,

x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 * 30 = 8376. But that's more than 8315.67. So perhaps approximately 29.8?

Wait, 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8 (because 279.2 *30=8376, minus 279.2 gives 8096.8)

Wait, 279.2 *29.8 = ?

Alternatively, let's compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute 8315.67 / 279.2:

Divide numerator and denominator by 10: 831.567 / 27.92

Approaching this division:

27.92 * 29 = 809.68 → 27.92 * 29 = 809.68
But 27.92 *29.8 → let's compute 27.92 * 29 = 809.68, 27.92 *0.8=22.336. So 809.68 +22.336=832.016.

Which is just about 831.567. Let me see:

27.92 *29.8 = 832.016 → which is a bit higher than 831.567. So the actual value is a little less than 29.8.

So x is approximately 29.8 → but wait, since 27.92 *29.8 gives 832, which is a bit higher than 831.567, so x is about 29.78 or something.

Wait, let's compute 27.92 *29.78.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of 27.92 * 29.78 = ?

But maybe let's go back. 8315.67 / 279.2 = 8315.67 / (279.2). Let me compute this as:

Compute 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8 → 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.

We have 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

So, 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.782.

So, x ≈ 29.782.

So p ≈ 29.782 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, x is in MeV/c units? Wait, because earlier, when I set c=1, the equation was E² = p² + m², so p is in MeV/c, and E is MeV.

So, E_nu = p = 29.782 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) = sqrt( (29.782)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.782^2 ≈ 887.07.

105.7^2 ≈ 11172.49.

So sum is 887.07 + 11172.49 = 12059.56.

sqrt(12059.56) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So E_mu is approximately 109.81 MeV.

Now, the energies are E_mu ≈ 109.81 MeV and E_nu ≈ 29.782 MeV.

But the question is about the kinetic energies of the product particles. So K_mu = E_mu - m_mu c². Since m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c², K_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 ≈ 4.11 MeV.

And for the neutrino, since its rest mass is zero, the kinetic energy is the same as its total energy, which is 29.782 MeV.

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.11 MeV and 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. That's very close to our calculation.

Wait, the question is about the product particles: mu(+) and nu. So the KEs are 4.11 MeV and 29.78 MeV.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes when I'm approximating, I might have made a mistake.

Wait, let me recalculate p.

We had:

2*139.6 x = 8315.67

So 279.2 x = 8315.67 → x = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2 precisely.

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8 → 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

218.87 / 279.2 → 218.87 ÷ 279.2 is approximately 0.782.

So x ≈ 29.782 MeV. So E_nu ≈ 29.782 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt( (29.782)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.782^2: 29.782 * 29.782.

Let me compute 30 *30=900. But 29.782 is slightly less than 30.

(30 - 0.218)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.218 + (0.218)^2 → 900 - 13.08 + 0.0475 → approximately 886.9675.

So 29.782^2 ≈ 886.9675.

105.7^2 is 11172.49.

So sum is 886.9675 + 11172.49 = 12059.4575.

E_mu = sqrt(12059.4575) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So K_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

E_nu=29.782 MeV, so K_nu=29.782 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D:4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. So that's the closest.

Wait, but let me check option B: 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV. That can't be right because the pion mass is 139.6, and the sum would be 7.2 + 32.8 =40, which would be way below the pion's mass. Wait, no, because I'm looking at kinetic energies, which are just parts of the total. Wait, no, the sum of the kinetic energies plus the rest mass energies should equal the pion's rest energy.

Wait, no, the total energy is sum of the rest mass energies plus kinetic energies. So:

Total energy = (m_mu c² + K_mu) + (m_nu c² + K_nu) → but m_nu is zero, so it's m_mu + K_mu + K_nu = 139.6.

So 105.7 + K_mu + K_nu =139.6 → K_mu + K_nu = 33.9 MeV.

In option D, K_mu=4.12, K_nu=29.8 → sum is 33.92, which matches. So that makes sense.

In option B: 7.2 +32.8=40, which doesn't match 33.9.

So D is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary pion (\(\pi^+\)) into a muon (\(\mu^+\)) and a neutrino (\(\nu\)). The rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\). The neutrino's rest mass is negligible (\(m_\nu \approx 0\)).

### Key Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before and after the decay must be conserved. Initially, the pion is stationary, so its total energy is its rest energy:  
   \[
   E_{\pi^+} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   After the decay, the total energy is shared between the muon and the neutrino:
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   The muon's total energy is \(E_{\mu^+} = m_{\mu^+} c^2 + K_{\mu^+}\), where \(K_{\mu^+}\) is its kinetic energy. The neutrino's total energy is purely kinetic, \(E_\nu = K_\nu\).

2. **Momentum Conservation**: Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum before the decay is zero. After the decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta:
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu.
   \]

### Energy-Momentum Relation
Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation \(E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4\), we express the momenta and energies of the muon and neutrino:
- For the muon:
  \[
  p_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{E_{\mu^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2 c^4}.
  \]
- For the neutrino:
  \[
  p_\nu = E_\nu.
  \]
  Since \(p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu\), we equate:
  \[
  \sqrt{E_{\mu^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2 c^4} = E_\nu.
  \]

### Solving for Energies
Substituting \(E_{\mu^+} = m_{\mu^+} c^2 + K_{\mu^+}\) and \(E_\nu = K_\nu\) into the energy conservation equation:
\[
m_{\mu^+} c^2 + K_{\mu^+} + K_\nu = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
K_{\mu^+} + K_\nu = 139.6 - m_{\mu^+} c^2 = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Using the momentum conservation relation, we solve for \(K_{\mu^+}\) and \(K_\nu\). After detailed calculations, the kinetic energies are found to be approximately:
\[
K_{\mu^+} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}, \quad K_\nu \approx 29.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Verifying the Options
- **Option A**: \(2.84 \, \text{MeV}, 26.8 \, \text{MeV}\) → Sum of kinetic energies is \(2.84 + 26.8 = 29.64 \, \text{MeV}\), which does not match \(33.9 \, \text{MeV}\).
- **Option B**: \(7.2 \, \text{MeV}, 32.8 \, \text{MeV}\) → Sum is \(7.2 + 32.8 = 40.0 \, \text{MeV}\), which exceeds \(33.9 \, \text{MeV}\).
- **Option C**: \(3.52 \, \text{MeV}, 20.8 \, \text{MeV}\) → Sum is \(3.52 + 20.8 = 24.32 \, \text{MeV}\), which does not match \(33.9 \, \text{MeV}\).
- **Option D**: \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV}\) → Sum is \(4.12 + 29.8 = 33.92 \, \text{MeV}\), which matches \(33.9 \, \text{MeV}\).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option D**.
