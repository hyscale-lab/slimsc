Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down.

The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I remember that the formation constant has something to do with the stability of the complex ion.

Wait, what's a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? Oh right, I think it means that the ratio of Ca²+ to EDTA^4- is 1:1. So the complex is [CaEDTA]^2− or something like that.

EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions. The formation constant, Kf, tells us how stable the complex is. The higher the Kf, the more stable the complex.

The problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. So, the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex, but there's some dissociation going on. The free Ca²+ concentration would be really low because the complex is very stable (since Kf is large).

Let me recall the formula. The formation constant Kf is given by the equation:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2−] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] )

But wait, in this case, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. Let's assume that the initial concentration is 0.02 M, and the complex dissociates a little bit into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−.

So, let me denote the concentration of the complex as C. C is 0.02 M. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4− would also be x, assuming that each complex releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4−.

Wait, no, wait. The complex is [CaEDTA]^2−. So when it dissociates, each mole gives one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4−. So, yes, if the dissociation is x, then both [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4−] are x.

So substituting into the Kf expression:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2−] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] )
5e10 = (0.02 - x) / (x * x )

But wait, because Kf is so large (5e10), the dissociation x will be very small compared to 0.02. So 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That simplifies the equation.

So:

5e10 ≈ 0.02 / x²

Solving for x:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10)
x² = 2e-3 / 5e10 = 2/5e13 = 4e-14?

Wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x squared is 4e-13. Taking the square root, x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7.

Wait, wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, so sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5 ≈ 3.16e-7. So x = 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That's close to what I'm getting. So that's probably the answer.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me re-calculate the steps.

The equation after approximation is:

Kf = 0.02 / (x^2)

So x^2 = 0.02 / Kf = 0.02 / (5e10) = 0.02 / 5e10.

0.02 divided by 5 is 0.004. So 0.004 / 1e10 is 4e-13.

x^2 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * 3.1623e-7 ≈ 6.324e-7.

Which is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which matches option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex at 25 °C, we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{[CaEDTA]}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) be \(x\). The equilibrium expression for \(K_f\) is:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}]^{2-}}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Substituting \([\text{CaEDTA}]^{2-} \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\) (since \(K_f\) is very large, dissociation is minimal) and \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\), we get:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.
