Alright, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the options given. To do that, I should first figure out what Compound X is by looking at its IR and NMR data.

Let me start with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400-2500 cm⁻¹, which usually suggests O-H stretching, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, another possibility is an alkyne's C-H stretch, but those are usually higher, around 3300 cm⁻¹. Oh, but that's for sp-hybridized C-H. Alternatively, maybe it's an amine's N-H, but those typically are around 3300-3500. Hmm, not sure yet. Also, there's a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ regions are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching, which makes sense if there's a benzene ring involved.

Now looking at the ¹H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is a strong indicator of an -OH proton, likely from a carboxylic acid. Because if it were an alcohol, the peak would be broader, but maybe in the lower ppm. Wait, carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm, so that fits. So maybe this is a carboxylic acid.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are doublets, which suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. The coupling is probably between adjacent protons. So maybe two substituents on the benzene ring, in a para arrangement. The higher ppm (8.0) suggests more electron-withdrawing groups, maybe like a carbonyl attached. Wait, but in the IR we saw a carbonyl at 1720, which could be a ketone or carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if the compound is a benzoic acid, the -COOH group would be attached to the benzene. The NMR shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which would be the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid. That makes sense.

Then, looking at the other NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is a multiplet, probably from a CH group adjacent to something, maybe near an oxygen or another group. Possibly a CH next to a carbonyl, but I'm not sure yet.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, perhaps from a CH2 group, maybe part of an ethyl or larger chain.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet with 3H, indicating a methyl group attached to a CH, like in an isopropyl group. Or maybe a geminal group, but more likely attached to a CH that's splitting into a doublet. For example, a CH(CH3) group.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet with 3H, which is typical for a methyl group at the end of a chain, like an ethyl group (CH2CH3). So maybe this is part of an ethyl chain attached to something else.

Putting this together, the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene. Let's see: one substituent is the carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and another substituent is another group. So the benzene would have -COOH and another group in the para positions.

In the NMR, the aromatic protons are in two doublets, which suggests that the substituents are in the para positions, each causing the adjacent protons to split into doublets. So the substituents would be on carbons 1 and 4 of the benzene ring.

So, the structure is likely para-substituted with a carboxylic acid group and another substituent.

The other substituent is probably an alkyl group, given the other NMR signals. Let's look at the non-aromatic signals.

The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) suggests a CH group. Then the 1.7 (m, 2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to that CH. The 1.4 (d,3H) is a methyl attached to the CH, making a CH(CH3) group. The 0.9 (t,3H) is a terminal methyl, part of an ethyl chain.

Wait, so perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group connected to a CH(CH3) group. So something like CH2CH(CH3). But wait, let me think: the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H. If it's a CH2 between a CH and another CH, perhaps it's part of a chain like CH2-CH(CH3)-.

Wait, let me draw this. If there's a benzene ring with a -COOH group and another substituent at the para position. The substituent is a group that has a CH2CH(CH3)2? Or perhaps it's a longer chain.

Wait, let's see: the substituent on the benzene is a group like -CH2CH(CH3)2? Or maybe -CH2CH2CH(CH3)2?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a butyl group. Let me think: the 1.4 ppm is a methyl as a doublet, so that suggests that the methyl is attached to a CH group, which is adjacent to another CH group, perhaps. For example, a group like CH2CH(CH3)CH2 something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. Because isobutyl would have a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait no, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. Hmm, maybe.

Wait, another approach: the substituent on the benzene ring is connected via a chain that includes an ethyl group. So maybe the substituent is a butyl group, but more specifically, a sec-butyl group.

Wait, let me think about the NMR. The 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H). That might be a CH group attached to another group. The 1.7 ppm is a multiplet (2H), which could be a CH2 connected to that CH. The 1.4 ppm is a methyl (d), so that would be a CH(CH3), and the 0.9 is a terminal methyl, meaning part of an ethyl chain.

Putting together: the substituent could be a group like -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, perhaps -(CH2)CH2CH(CH3)2? Or maybe -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group attached to a CH group which is attached to a methyl. So perhaps it's a propyl group with a branch. Let me think: the substituent is a propyl group with a branch, like -CH2-CH(CH3)-. But how does that connect?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group. The structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no. Let me get the substituent correct. The substituent is attached to the benzene as a group, say, R.

R would have a chain that includes a CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? Or perhaps R is a butyl group where the branching is on the second carbon.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the substituent is a pentyl group? Maybe not. Let's think about the NMR.

Another approach: the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)-something. Because the 2.9 ppm is 1H (a CH), 1.7 is 2H (CH2), 1.4 is 3H (methyl), and 0.9 is 3H (terminal methyl). So perhaps the substituent is like -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, but that would be a pentyl group? Or maybe a butyl group.

Wait, the substituent would have a structure where the CH group is attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH2CH3. So it's -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that would be a pentyl group, but that doesn't seem to fit the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Hmm, but the NMR doesn't show any peaks beyond 1.7 ppm apart from the aromatic region.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group attached to a longer chain, but I don't think that's the case here. Alternatively, maybe it's an isopropyl group attached to another chain.

Wait, let's think about the substituent as a butyl group. The substituent is attached to the benzene as a R group. The R group would have a structure like -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that would be a pentyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a butyl group with a branch. Let's consider the possibility that the substituent is a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that's not exactly correct. Wait, sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. Hmm, perhaps if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, that would fit.

So, substituent structure: -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-. Wait, perhaps it's -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a tert-butyl group, but that would have a different NMR pattern.

Wait, another approach: the substituent's NMR signals. The 2.9 ppm (1H, m) must be a CH next to something, maybe an oxygen or another CH group.

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be a CH2 adjacent to that CH.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl attached to the CH, making a CH(CH3).

The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a methyl at the end of a chain, like CH2CH3.

So maybe the substituent is -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, that would be a pentyl group with a branch, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, which is a butyl group with a branch. But how?

Wait, if the substituent is a (sec-butyl) group, then the structure would be CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the substituent as a propan-2-yl group, which is isopropyl. But that would have a CH(CH3)2 group. But that doesn't account for the CH2CH3 part.

Another possibility: the substituent is a butyl group where the branching is such that we have a CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. Wait, perhaps it's a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group? Or maybe the substituent is a pentyl group, but that seems more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group, which would be a neopentyl group, but that doesn't have a terminal CH3.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. That would be a pentyl group with a branch on the second carbon. But is that possible?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, making a structure like -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-. But that would give a CH group (which would be the 2.9 ppm), a CH2 next to it (1.7 ppm, 2H), and then the CH2CH3 group (0.9 ppm, 3H as triplet). But wait, how is the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) accounted for? Because in this scenario, the CH would be next to a CH2, and the CH has a methyl attached, so the structure would be -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the substituent would be -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. That's a pentyl group with a branch on the first carbon.

Wait, let me count the carbons. The substituent would be CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to the benzene. So the benzene is attached to a CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3 group. But then, the NMR for this substituent would have:

- The CH(CH3) group as a triplet or something else, but in this case, it's a CH adjacent to a CH2.

Wait, but the 1H NMR shows:

2.9 ppm (m,1H) → the CH group.

1.7 ppm (m,2H) → the CH2 next to the CH.

Then, 1.4 ppm (d,3H) → this would be the methyl group attached to the CH. So the structure would be CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the substituent is -(CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3). But that's a pentyl group with a branch on the first carbon.

But wait, that would make the substituent a 4-methylpentyl group? No, perhaps a 2-methylpropyl group, but that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with a branch on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But that's a pentyl group again.

Wait, perhaps it's a butyl group but with a branching. Wait, the substituent could be a isobutyl group. The isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. No, that would have a CH(CH3)2 group, which would have a single methyl attached, but then the NMR for that would be different.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. The structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, no. Let me think again. The substituent is a group that, when attached to the benzene, has the structure:

Ph–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3?

No, that would be a pentyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's Ph–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH2–CH3. But that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a isopropyl group attached to a methyl group. No, not sure.

Wait, maybe I should consider the substituent as a butyl group where the branching is on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2–CH(CH2CH3)–CH2–, but I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -(CH2)2CH(CH3) group. So benzene attached to -(CH2)2CH(CH3), but that would be a pentyl group again.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think differently. Since the IR shows a carbonyl (1720 cm⁻¹), and a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, it's likely a carboxylic acid. So the substituent on the benzene is a carboxylic acid group, and another substituent which is an alkyl group.

So the compound is probably para-substituted between -COOH and another group (R), which is an alkyl group.

The NMR shows aromatic protons as two doublets, which means the substituents are para to each other. The integration for the aromatic protons is 2H each, so it's a disubstituted benzene, para.

Now, the substituent R is an alkyl group connected to the benzene. The NMR for R shows:

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): likely a CH group adjacent to another group.

- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): a CH2 adjacent to the CH.

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): a methyl attached to the CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): a terminal methyl, probably part of an ethyl chain.

So the substituent R's structure would be something like -(CH2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's a pentyl group with a branch on the second carbon. So, substituent would be -(CH2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the structure is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3. But wait, that's a pentyl group, but how does it connect to the benzene?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a butyl group with a branch. Let me think: substituent R is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that's a pentyl group again.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-. Hmm, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, but that would give the NMR signals as:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3), but I'm not sure if that fits the data.

Wait, maybe it's an ethyl group attached to a CH(CH3) group. So R would be -CH(CH3)CH2CH3. That structure is -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, which is a pentyl group with a branch on the first carbon. But then, the CH2CH3 would be at the end, which would give the triplet at 0.9 ppm.

In that case, the substituent would be a 3-methylbutyl group. Let's see:

Structure: benzene ring with substituents at para positions, one being -COOH and the other being -(CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3).

Wait, but the NMR would then show:

The CH group: 2.9 ppm (m,1H).

The adjacent CH2: 1.7 ppm (m,2H).

The CH(CH3) would have a methyl at 1.4 ppm (d,3H).

And the terminal CH2CH3 would show up as triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H).

So that would fit the data. So the substituent is a 3-methylbutyl group: -(CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3).

Wait, but that's a five-carbon group attached to the benzene. Alternatively, perhaps it's a butyl group with a methyl branch, like a sec-butyl group.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a isobutyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. But wait, the isobutyl group has three carbons: CH2-CH(CH3)2. Then, the NMR would show the CH(CH3)2 as a singlet, which is not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but that would require more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a tert-pentyl group, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the reaction. The compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. But wait, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and red phosphorus, but maybe here it's a different reaction. Alternatively, HI with red phosphorus could be a deoxygenation reaction.

Wait, another possibility: treatment with red phosphorus and HI is used for the elimination of a group. Hmm, perhaps it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, if Compound X has a carbonyl group (from the IR), and after reaction with HI and red phosphorus, it would lose the carbonyl. For example, if it's a ketone, the Clemmensen reduction would reduce it to a CH2 group.

But wait, in this case, the IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a carbonyl. So if it's a ketone, after reduction, the carbonyl becomes a CH2 group.

Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, maybe it's converted into a methyl ester or something else. Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a broad peak, which would be the -OH of a carboxylic acid.

So, if X is a carboxylic acid, perhaps the reaction is converting the -COOH group into something else.

Wait, what's the reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI? I'm not exactly sure. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cleavage reaction. For example, in the presence of HI and red phosphorus, maybe the carboxylic acid is converted into an acid chloride, but that typically uses PCl5 or similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced. Alternatively, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that typically uses a Lewis acid like AlCl3.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI are used in the Eschweiler-Clarke reaction, but that's for amination of amines. Hmm, perhaps not relevant here.

Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where the carbonyl group is being removed. For example, in the presence of HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the carbonyl is converted into a CH2 group. So, for example, a ketone (or aldehyde) would be reduced to a CH2 group.

Wait, but if the starting compound is a carboxylic acid, perhaps the reaction would convert it into a methyl ester or something else. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is removing the -COOH group. For example, if the compound is a phenyl ester, maybe the reaction would cleave it. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the options given. The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Hmm, so the options are either benzoic acids with substituents or substituted benzenes.

Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Let me think about what that does. Perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation or deoxygenation.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a demethylation reaction. For example, if the compound has a methyl ester, HI and red phosphorus could hydrolyze it. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting a ketone into an alkane. So, if the starting material is a ketone, it would be reduced to a CH2 group.

Wait, but if Compound X is a ketone attached to a benzene ring, then treating it with red phosphorus and HI would reduce it to a CH2 group, leading to a substituted benzene.

But going back to the NMR of Compound X. If it's a benzophenone derivative, but the NMR shows a carboxylic acid proton, then it can't be a ketone. Because a ketone would have a carbonyl but no -OH. So the presence of the -OH suggests it's a carboxylic acid.

So, the initial compound is a para-substituted benzoic acid with another substituent. Let's say it's 4-(R)-benzoic acid.

Now, when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens? Let me think: Red phosphorus and HI can be used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but that's a different scenario. Alternatively, perhaps it's a decarboxylation reaction. For example, benzoic acid can be decarboxylated under certain conditions to form benzene.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution of the -COOH group with another group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is removing the -COOH group to form a benzene ring with the substituent R.

Wait, but let's think about the options. Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which would be the same as the starting material if the substituent is a sec-butyl group. But if the reaction is removing the -COOH group, then the product would be a substituted benzene without the carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, options B and D are substituted benzenes. So perhaps the reaction is converting the benzoic acid into a benzene ring with another substituent.

Wait, but how? Because benzoic acid is a strong acid, and I'm not sure how it would react with red phosphorus and HI. Alternatively, perhaps the HI is acting as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group. If the starting material is a benzophenone (a ketone), then HI would add to it, but in the presence of red phosphorus, perhaps it's a Staudinger reaction for imines, but that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed removal of the carboxylic acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the starting material isn't a carboxylic acid but an ester. Let me reevaluate the IR data. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. 1720 could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or acid. But the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is high and likely an -OH, as in a carboxylic acid. So the 1720 would be the carboxylic acid's carbonyl.

Wait, but carboxylic acids typically have a carbonyl around 1700 cm⁻¹. So 1720 is a bit higher, which could suggest something else, like an ester or a ketone. Hmm, maybe I should reconsider.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is an acid derivative, like an acyl chloride. But then the NMR wouldn't have an -OH proton. So that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. But then the 10.5 ppm peak wouldn't make sense, unless it's an enol. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the compound is a benzophenone with an ester group. But that seems unlikely.

Let me try to re-examine the NMR data. The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, which is characteristic of an -OH group in a carboxylic acid. So the starting material is likely a benzoic acid with a substituent.

So, the structure is 4-(substituent)benzoic acid.

Now, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Let's think about what happens when a carboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I'm not very familiar with this exact reaction, but let me think.

Red phosphorus is sometimes used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but that's not applicable here. Alternatively, in the presence of HI, maybe it's a substitution reaction. For example, if the -COOH group is replaced by something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an -I group. But I don't see any options with iodine.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ring substitution. But the options don't show any iodine, so perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would imply that the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzoic acid. So after reaction, would it change?

Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That's a bit unclear, but it suggests a propionic acid with a substituent.

Option B and D are substituted benzenes, without a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, if the reaction converts the benzoic acid into benzene, then the product would be a substituted benzene. So perhaps the -COOH group is removed.

But under what conditions would that happen? Decarboxylation typically requires heat and sometimes a base or acid. Red phosphorus is a strong reducing agent. Maybe in this case, the -COOH group is reduced.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the carboxylic acid to a methyl group. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the -COOH could be reduced to a CH2OH group, but that would require other reagents, like LiAlH4.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting the carboxylic acid into a benzyl group.

Wait, I'm not making progress here. Let me think about the options.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would have the same substituents as the starting material, so if the reaction is not changing the substituent, perhaps it's not the product.

But the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which probably changes the structure.

Wait, another approach: the substituent R in the starting material is a group that can be modified during the reaction.

If the substituent R is an ethyl group, then perhaps the reaction doesn't affect it. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of the carbonyl group. For example, if the starting material is a benzophenone (a ketone), the reaction would reduce it to a CH2 group. But if the starting material is a carboxylic acid, perhaps the reaction would convert it into a methyl group.

Wait, but how? Let me think: if the starting material is a carboxylic acid, RCOOH, then under strong reducing conditions, maybe it would be converted into RCH2OH (a primary alcohol), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the -COOH is replaced by a hydrogen. But that would produce a benzene ring with a hydrogen where the -COOH was, which doesn't match any options.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that typically uses a Lewis acid catalyst like AlCl3. Red phosphorus isn't usually used for that.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by another group from HI. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is deoxygenation. For example, if the starting material is a benzaldehyde, HI and red phosphorus would reduce it to benzene. But in this case, the starting material is a benzoic acid, which has a higher oxidation state.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is removing the oxygen from the -COOH group, converting it into a methyl group. So RCOOH → RCH3.

If that's the case, the product would be a substituted benzene with the substituent R, which was previously attached to the carboxylic acid.

So, for example, if the starting material was 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzene, which is option D.

Wait, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Hmm, no, because the substituent is at position 1 and 4. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That would mean substituents at positions 1 and 4. But in our case, the starting material is a para-substituted benzoic acid, with substituents at positions 1 and 4: -COOH and R.

If the reaction removes the -COOH group and replaces it with a hydrogen, then the product would be a benzene with R at position 4. But looking at the options, option D has substituents at 1 and 4: a sec-butyl at position 1 and a methyl at position 4. That doesn't match, unless the R group is a methyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to map this out.

If the starting material is 4-(R)benzoic acid, and the reaction converts the -COOH group into a hydrogen, then the product is 4-(R)benzene. So if R is a sec-butyl group, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzene. But none of the options exactly match that. Let's look again.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's cumene, with isobutyl at position 1 and methyl at position 4.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So substituents at positions 1 (sec-butyl) and 4 (methyl).

Wait, perhaps the R group in the starting material is a sec-butyl group, so the product would have a sec-butyl at position 4 and a methyl at position 1, but that's not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent R is a methyl group. Hmm, but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the substituent R.

Looking back at the NMR data for R:

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H) → likely a CH group.

- 1.7 ppm (m,2H) → a CH2 group.

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H) → a methyl attached to the CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H) → a terminal methyl, part of an ethyl chain.

So R is a group like -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, because that would be a butyl group with a branch. Alternatively, perhaps R is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: the substituent R has the structure -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Then the NMR would show:

- The central CH would be at 2.9 ppm.

- The adjacent CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm.

- The CH(CH3) would have a methyl at 1.4 ppm.

- The terminal CH2CH3 would have the triplet at 0.9 ppm.

So R would be a pentyl group with a branch on the second carbon. But if the starting material is 4-R-benzoic acid, and the reaction removes the -COOH group, then the product would be 4-R-benzene.

But looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So R in the starting material would be a group that upon reaction becomes a sec-butyl and a methyl.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently. Let's look at the options and see which one fits the starting material.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Its structure would be a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para position.

So, the IR would show a carbonyl at 1720 (the -COOH) and aromatic C=C at 1610 and 1450.

The NMR would show:

- 10.5 ppm (OH of -COOH, singlet, broad).

- Aromatic protons as two doublets, integrating to 2H each.

The non-aromatic protons would be:

- The sec-butyl group: the CH2 groups and the CH groups.

Wait, the sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2.

Wait, no, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, no, more precisely, it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, I'm getting confused. The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. So the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene.

But in that case, the NMR for the substituent would be:

- The CH(CH3) would have a singlet for the methyl, but in the data, the methyl is a doublet (1.4 ppm, d, 3H). So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group: CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. Then, the NMR would show the CH(CH2CH3) as a triplet or something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a neopentyl group, but that has a central CH2.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should proceed to the reaction part.

Assuming the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen?

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but in this case, the starting material is a benzoic acid. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by a hydrogen, leading to a benzene ring with the substituent.

So, if the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzene. But looking at the options, there's no such option. The closest is option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Wait, unless the substituent R in the starting material is not a sec-butyl but a longer chain that upon reaction breaks down into a methyl group.

Wait, another possibility: if the substituent R in the starting material is a butyl group, and upon reaction, it loses some carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, and the reaction doesn't affect it.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is adding iodide to the ring. But that's not reflected in the options.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress. Another approach: the reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI could be a decarboxylation reaction, removing the -COOH group and releasing CO2. If that's the case, the product would be a substituted benzene.

So, if the starting material is 4-(R)benzoic acid, the product would be 4-R-benzene.

Looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So if R is a sec-butyl group, then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzene, but that's not an option. Wait, perhaps R is a methyl group, so the product would be toluene. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the substituent R is a ethyl group. Then the product would be ethylbenzene, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the substituent R is a methyl group, and the product is xylene. But again, the options don't show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't remove the -COOH group but modifies it. For example, converting the -COOH into a methyl ester. But that would require a different reagent, like an alcohol and acid catalyst.

I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of the reaction again. Red phosphorus and HI could be used in the hydroxyamination of a nitrile, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an -I group, but that doesn't fit any options.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but without a Lewis acid, I don't think that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a reduction of the carbonyl group. For example, if the starting material is a ketone, it would be reduced to a CH2 group. But in this case, the starting material is a carboxylic acid, which is more oxidized.

Wait, if the starting material is a carboxylic acid, perhaps the reaction reduces it to a CH2O group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis. If the starting material were an ester, it would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. But the starting material is already a carboxylic acid.

I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another angle.

Looking back at the NMR, the substituent R has a CH group (2.9 ppm, m), a CH2 (1.7, m), a CH(CH3) (1.4, d), and a CH2CH3 (0.9, t). So R's structure is likely -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. That's a pentyl group with a branch on the first carbon. So the substituent is -(CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3).

Wait, that's a 4-methylpentyl group. So the substituent R is a 4-methylpentyl group attached to the benzene ring at the para position to the -COOH group.

Now, when the reaction occurs, what happens? If the reaction is a reduction or substitution that removes the -COOH group, the product would be a benzene ring with the 4-methylpentyl group attached at the para position. But looking at the options, none of them match that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the substituent R but converts the -COOH group into something else.

Wait, another approach: if the reaction is a decarboxylation, the -COOH group is removed, and a CH2 group is formed. So the benzene ring would have a CH2 group at the position where the -COOH was. But that's not reflected in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an -I group, but again, the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a Vilsmeier-Haack reaction, but that's for formylation and requires a Lewis acid, which isn't present here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but without a leaving group, that's unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and the reaction converts it into 4-(sec-butyl)benzene, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the options don't have 4-(sec-butyl)benzene, but option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So if the starting material's substituent R was a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, then upon reaction, it might rearrange. But I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the substituent R is a pentyl group with a branch, and upon reaction, it loses two carbons, becoming a propyl group. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling that adds a methyl group.

I'm stuck. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the data.

Given the NMR data, the substituent R is likely a sec-butyl group. So the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). When treated with red phosphorus and HI, it could undergo a reaction that removes the -COOH group, resulting in 4-(sec-butyl)benzene. However, none of the options match that exactly.

Wait, looking at option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That would imply substituents at positions 1 and 4. If the starting material had a substituent at position 4 (the -COOH) and another substituent at position 1, but that's not what the NMR shows. The NMR suggests a para-substituted benzene with only two substituents: -COOH and R.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the substituent R but removes the -COOH. So the product would be a benzene with R at position 4. But if R is a sec-butyl group, that would give option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene only if there's another substituent at position 4. No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction adds a methyl group to the benzene ring. But without more information, it's hard to say.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on the NMR data, the starting material is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a substituent R that has a CH, CH2, and methyl groups. The reaction likely removes the -COOH group, leaving behind a benzene with R as a substituent. Among the options, option D has a substituent that could arise from such a reaction, but I'm not entirely sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product of a reaction involving Compound X, which has given IR and NMR data. The IR data shows strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ (carbonyl group) and 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (likely an -OH stretch, suggesting a carboxylic acid). The NMR data indicates a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and another substituent. The non-aromatic signals suggest a substituent with a CH group (2.9 ppm, m), a CH2 group (1.7 ppm, m), a methyl group attached to the CH (1.4 ppm, d), and a terminal methyl group (0.9 ppm, t), consistent with a pentyl group with a branch.

The reaction conditions (red phosphorus and HI) are ambiguous, but they likely involve the removal or modification of the carboxylic acid group. A plausible interpretation is that the -COOH group is removed, leaving behind a benzene ring with the substituent R. Based on the NMR data, R is identified as a pentyl group with a branch, which could rearrange or simplify during the reaction.

Among the options:

- **Option A** (2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid) does not match the NMR data, as it would not produce the observed substituent pattern.
- **Option B** (1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene) suggests a substituent pattern inconsistent with the NMR data for R.
- **Option C** (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) matches the starting material but does not account for the reaction conditions, as it retains the -COOH group.
- **Option D** (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene) is consistent with the reaction removing the -COOH group and leaving behind a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4.

Given the reaction conditions and the NMR data, the most likely product is **Option D**, as it aligns with the removal of the -COOH group and the resulting substituent pattern.
