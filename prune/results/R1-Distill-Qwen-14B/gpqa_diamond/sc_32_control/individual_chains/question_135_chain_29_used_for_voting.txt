Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term involving a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f (y). Wait, I think I should parse this correctly. Oh right, the bar is on psi, so it's the Dirac adjoint. So the interaction term looks like -λ f ψ_f (y) X(y) ψ_f(y). That probably means that the boson X couples to fermions with a coupling strength λ. 

So X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The mass of X is 6 GeV. I need to find which fermions it can decay into, considering their masses.

First, I remember that for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the sum of the fermion masses must be less than the mass of the boson. Also, because each fermion has a rest mass, the maximum possible is when each is half the boson's mass. But wait, for a spin-0 boson (like the Higgs), the decay products must be a pair of identical particles, which is what the question seems to have. 

So the possible fermions are quarks and leptons. Let me list out the masses of all the known fermions.

Quarks:
- Up (u): around 2.2 MeV
- Down (d): about 4.7 MeV
- Strange (s): ~100 MeV
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.7 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV. So X can't decay into top quarks since 6 GeV is way below 173 GeV.

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos are negligible in mass, so they're probably not considered here because the decay would involve neutrinos, but I'm not sure if the problem counts them.

Wait, the problem is about decays into charged fermions, so neutrinos are neutral, but the interaction term is with ψ_f, which would include charged fermions? Or can it include neutrinos? Hmm, the problem says "fermions" but in the Lagrangian, X couples to fermions—probably to the matter fields, which include charged leptons and quarks. So neutrinos are probably excluded here because they are neutral and don't have charge to couple directly, unless X is a neutral boson.

Wait, but the Lagrangian is written as ψ_f (y) X(y) ψ_f(y). So that would imply that X is coupling to a fermion and its adjoint, so X must be a scalar (since it's a bosonic field) and the term would be something like X \bar{\psi} \psi, which is a Yukawa coupling.

So for each fermion, the mass of X must be greater than twice the fermion mass for the decay to be possible. So X can decay into a pair of fermions f and fbar.

So X has mass 6 GeV.

Let's calculate what fermions have mass less than 3 GeV (since 6 GeV / 2 = 3 GeV).

Quarks:

- Up: 2.2 MeV → yes
- Down: 4.7 MeV → yes
- Strange: ~100 MeV → yes
- Charm: 1.5 GeV → 1.5 GeV is less than 3, so yes.
- Bottom: 4.7 GeV → 4.7 > 3 → no, so X can't decay into b bbar.
Wait, wait wait. The bottom quark is around 4.7 GeV. So 4.7 *2 is about 9.4 GeV. The X is only 6 GeV. So that's not allowed. So b quarks are out.

So possible quarks are u, d, s, c.

Leptons:

- Electron: 0.5 MeV → yes
- Muon: 105.7 MeV → yes
- Tau: 1.78 GeV → 1.78 * 2 = 3.56 GeV. X is 6 GeV, which is larger than 3.56, so yes. So tau can be a decay product.

Wait, wait, 3.56 GeV is less than 6 GeV, so yes, X can decay into tau pairs.

What about the muon? 105.7 MeV. 2 * 105.7 MeV is 211.4 MeV, which is much less than 6 GeV. So mu+ mu- decay is allowed.

So all the fermions that X can decay into are:

- u and ubar
- d and dbar
- s and sbar
- c and cbar
- tau+ tau-
- e+ e-
- mu+ mu-

Wait, but wait, the Lagrangian term is for each fermion type. So if the term is -λ f ψ_f (y) X(y) ψ_f(y), then X couples to each type of fermion f. So for each f, X can decay into f fbar.

So which options include these possibilities?

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→ b bbar, s sbar, u u, d dbar, tau+, tau- , e+ e-.

But wait, this includes b, which we determined can't, because 4.7 GeV is more than half of 6 GeV. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u u, d dbar, tau, mu, e pairs.

So that includes c, which is allowed because 1.5 GeV *2 is 3 GeV <6 GeV.

So B includes c cbar, which is allowed. Also, in option B, the possible decays are:

c cbar, s sbar, u u, d dbar, tau, mu, e.

Wait, but in B, the options are:

c\bar{c}, s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},\tau^{+}\tau^{-},\mu^{+}\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}

So that's correct, because all these fermion pairs have masses below 3 GeV.

But wait, what about the tau? The tau is 1.78 GeV. So 2 *1.78 is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So allowed.

Option C: They include t (top quark) which is way too heavy. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Includes b and tau but not c or mu? Wait, let me check D.

Option D: X→ b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, but they don't include c cbar. Since the mass of c is 1.5 GeV, which is allowed because 2 *1.5=3 <6. So if D doesn't include c, it's wrong. Let me check the options again.

Looking back:

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all allowed.

Option D: b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So no c. But why would a decay include b and not c? Because the X can't decay into b bbar, because m_X=6 GeV is less than 2*m_b (about 9.4 GeV). So B is correct.

Wait, no, wait. The m_b is about 4.7 GeV. So 2 *4.7 is 9.4 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar. So any option that includes b is wrong.

Wait, the problem is whether the decay is allowed. So X can't decay into b bbar because 2*mb > m_X.

So looking at the options, option A and D include b. So they are incorrect.

So only options B and C are left.

Option C: includes c, which is allowed, but also includes top quark, which is not allowed.

So C is wrong because top is too heavy.

So the correct options are in B.

Looking at option B, it includes c, which is allowed, and all the other allowed fermions.

So the possible decays are c cbar, s sbar, u u, d dbar, tau, mu, e.

So the correct answer is option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction is given by the Lagrangian term:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) X(y) \psi_f(y),
\]

which indicates that \( X \) couples to fermions \( f \) via a Yukawa-like interaction. For a boson to decay into a pair of fermions \( f \bar{f} \), the mass of the boson must be greater than twice the mass of the fermion (\( m_X > 2m_f \)).

### Step 1: Fermion Mass Constraints
The masses of the fermions are as follows:
- **Quarks**:
  - Up (\( u \)): \( \sim 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \)
  - Down (\( d \)): \( \sim 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
  - Strange (\( s \)): \( \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \)
  - Charm (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
  - Bottom (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \)
  - Top (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy for \( X \))
- **Leptons**:
  - Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \)
  - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
  - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)

From the mass constraint \( m_X > 2m_f \), the allowed fermions are:
- \( u, d, s, c \) (quarks with \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \)),
- \( e, \mu, \tau \) (leptons with \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).

The \( b \)-quark (\( m_b \sim 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \)) and \( t \)-quark (\( m_t \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)) are excluded because \( 2m_b > m_X \) and \( m_t \gg m_X \).

### Step 2: Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > m_X \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which satisfy \( m_X > 2m_f \). This option is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( m_t \gg m_X \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > m_X \). Hence, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
