Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and think through what it's asking.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. Half of it is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. The setup is that when only one hemisphere is spotted, the star's brightness changes as it rotates, making it look like it has an exoplanet causing the variations. The question is, what would the radius of such a planet need to be to produce the same brightness change as the spots?

Hmm, I remember that brightness variations can be due to either spots or transiting planets. When a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the light, causing a dip in brightness. Similarly, spots on the star can cause a variation as the star rotates and the spots come into and out of view.

Wait, the problem says that the star is covered in spots, which cause a brightness dip when they're on the side facing us. But when the planet transits, it also blocks some light. We need to compare these two effects to find the planet radius that would produce the same change in brightness.

So first, I think I need to calculate the change in brightness caused by the spots. Then, find what planet size would cause the same change.

Let me break it down.

The star's radius is Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Oh, wait, the problem says a hemisphere is covered. So the total area with spots is 20% of half the star's surface. Or wait, filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So the entire spotted area is 0.2 times the area of one hemisphere of the star.

Wait, the star's surface area is 4πR². Each hemisphere is 2πR². So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

But wait, the effective temperature of the star is 6000 K. The spots are cooler, at (6000 - 1000)=5000 K? Or wait, the temperature difference is 1000K. It says the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. So spots are 5000 K?

Wait, the star's Teff is 6000 K. Spots are 1000 K cooler, so their Teff is 5000 K.

So the total brightness of the star is the sum of the unspotted areas and the spotted areas.

Let me compute the star's total luminosity when spots are present. Normally, the star's luminosity is L = 4πR² * σ T^4. But with spots, part of the surface is emitting less.

Wait, the star is a blackbody. So the total flux without spots would be (σ T_eff^4) per unit area.

When spots are present, the flux is from the unspotted areas plus the spotted areas.

The fraction of the area that's spotted is 0.2 on one hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR².

The area of the unspotted regions is the rest. Each hemisphere has 2πR², so the other hemisphere is 2πR², and on the same hemisphere, 80% is unspotted. So the unspotted area is (0.8 * 2πR²) + 2πR² = (1.8 * 2πR² ? Wait no. Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered with spots at 20% filling. So the other hemisphere is completely unspotted.

Wait, correction:

- Total star area: 4πR².

- One hemisphere (2πR²) is covered 20% with spots. So the spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

- The unspotted area in that hemisphere: 2πR² - 0.4πR² = 1.6πR².

- The other hemisphere is entirely unspotted: 2πR².

So total unspotted area is 1.6πR² + 2πR² = 3.6πR².

Spotted area: 0.4πR².

So the total luminosity when spots are present is:

L_spotty = (unspotted area) * σ T_star^4 + (spotted area) * σ T_spot^4.

Which is L_spotty = (3.6πR² + 0.4πR²) * σ T_star^4? No, wait, no. Each area has its own temperature.

Wait, no. The unspotted area is at T_star, and the spotted area is at T_spot.

So L_spotty = (3.6πR²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.4πR²) * σ (5000)^4.

The total without any spots (if the star was unspotted) is L_clear = 4πR² * σ (6000)^4.

So the ratio of L_spotty to L_clear is [3.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(5000^4)] / (4*(6000^4)).

Hmm, perhaps I can compute this ratio to find the change in brightness.

Wait, but the problem says that photometric observations show brightness variations because of the spots. But when the spots are on the far side, the brightness is higher. So the maximum brightness would be when no spots are visible, and the minimum when the spots are facing us.

Wait no, wait the star is rotating, so as the spots come into view, the brightness decreases because the spots are darker. So the brightness varies between maximum (when spots are not visible) and minimum (when spots are fully visible).

So the amplitude of the variation is the maximum minus the minimum divided by some factor. Wait, perhaps the variation is (L_max - L_min) / L_max? Or maybe the fractional change is (ΔL)/L.

But in the case of the star with spots, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, then the total luminosity is L_spotty, which is lower than the clear case.

Wait, no. Wait, the star's full luminosity would be when all the bright areas are visible. When the spots are facing us, the star appears dimmer.

Wait, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is L_spotty, which is lower than L_clear.

So the change in brightness (amplitude) is (L_clear - L_spotty)/L_clear.

Wait, but the problem says that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So, when a planet transits in front of the star, it blocks some light, causing a dip in brightness equal to (R_planet / R_star)^2 of the star's light. Because the area blocked is π R_planet², and the star's area is π R_star² in the path, so the blocked fraction is (R_p / R_s)^2.

But in this problem, the star is itself causing a dip due to its spots. So the amplitude of the dip caused by spots (when the spots are fully visible) would be (L_clear - L_spotty)/L_clear.

We need to find the planet radius R_p such that the dip caused by the planet is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

So, the dip caused by the planet is (R_p/R_s)^2, because the planet blocks a part of the star's light.

Wait, but wait. The dip for the planet is the area of the planet's disk divided by the area of the star's disk. That is, (R_p / R_star)^2.

But the dip caused by the spots is (L_clear - L_spotty)/L_clear. Let me calculate that.

So first, compute L_spotty.

L_spotty = (3.6 * (6000)^4 + 0.4 * (5000)^4) * σ * π R².

Wait, no, the way I calculated earlier, the total L_spotty is (3.6 + 0.4) * π R² * σ T^4, but with each T.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio.

Compute the average brightness when the spots are visible (the minimum).

So, the average flux is (3.6 * (6000^4) + 0.4 * (5000^4)) ) / (4 * 6000^4 )

Because, normally, all areas would be 4πR² * σ (6000)^4.

So the ratio is [3.6 * (6000^4) + 0.4 * (5000^4)] divided by [4 * (6000^4) ].

Let me compute each term.

Compute 6000^4: (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4: (5e3)^4 = 625 * 1e12 = 6.25e14.

So,

3.6 * 6000^4 = 3.6 * 1.296e15 = 4.6656e15.

0.4 * 5000^4 = 0.4 * 6.25e14 = 2.5e14.

Sum: 4.6656e15 + 2.5e14 = 4.9156e15.

Denominator: 4 * 1.296e15 = 5.184e15.

So the ratio is (4.9156e15) / (5.184e15) ≈ 0.9483.

So the average brightness when the spots are visible is ~0.9483 times the clear star's brightness.

Wait, but wait, no. Because when the spots are on the far side, the brightness is higher, but when they are on the near side, it's lower.

Wait, no, the star's brightness as observed depends on which part is facing us. The variation is between the maximum (when spots are not visible) and the minimum (when spots are fully visible).

But in the scenario where only one hemisphere is spotted, the star's brightness is modulated as it rotates. The amplitude of the variation would be the difference between when the spotted hemisphere is facing us and when it's not.

Wait, perhaps the maximum brightness is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

So the maximum brightness is when the entire visible hemisphere is unspotted.

Wait, but the star's brightness is the sum of the flux from the part we can see.

Wait, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the visible area is 2π R², with 0.2 of it being spots and 0.8 being unspotted.

So the flux when the spots are visible is:

Flux = (0.8 * (6000^4) ) * π R² + (0.2 * (5000^4) ) * π R².

Wait, because the area is 2π R² per hemisphere, so 0.8 of that is unspotted, 0.2 is spotted.

So the flux when the spots are visible is:

L_min = [0.8 * (6000^4) + 0.2 * (5000^4)] * π R² * σ.

Wait, but wait, the star's total flux when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us (so all 2π R² is unspotted) is:

L_max = (6000^4) * 2π R² * σ.

So the dip in flux is (L_max - L_min) / L_max.

Wait, let me compute that.

L_min = [0.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4 ] * π R² * σ.

Wait, no, because when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the area we see is 2π R², same as when the other hemisphere is facing us. So in the spotted case, the flux is (0.8 * 6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4) per unit area.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the brightness when the spots are visible (min) and when they're not (max), and find the fractional change.

So,

L_max = (6000^4) * (2π R²) * σ.

L_min = [0.8*(6000^4) + 0.2*(5000^4)] * (2π R²) * σ.

Wait, no, because the spotted hemisphere is 2π R², with 20% spots. So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, 20% of 2π R² is at 5000 K, the rest at 6000 K.

So,

L_min = (0.8 * 6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4) * (π R²) * σ.

Wait, no, wait. No, when the hemisphere is viewed, the area is 2π R². So the total flux from the visible hemisphere is:

(0.8 * 2π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.2 * 2π R²) * σ (5000)^4.

But wait, the area is 2π R² for the hemisphere. So, 0.8 of that area (1.6π R²) is at 6000 K, and 0.2 of that area (0.4π R²) is at 5000 K.

So,

L_min = [1.6π R² * σ (6000)^4 + 0.4π R² * σ (5000)^4 ].

Similarly, when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, L_max is:

L_max = 2π R² * σ (6000)^4.

So the dip is (L_max - L_min) / L_max.

Let me compute the ratio (L_min/L_max) to find the fractional brightness.

Compute L_min / L_max = [1.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(5000^4)] / [2*(6000^4)].

Compute each term:

6000^4 = 1.296e15 (as before).

5000^4 = 6.25e14.

So,

1.6 * 1.296e15 = 2.0736e15.

0.4 * 6.25e14 = 2.5e14.

Sum: 2.0736e15 + 2.5e14 = 2.3236e15.

Denominator: 2 * 1.296e15 = 2.592e15.

So,

L_min / L_max = 2.3236e15 / 2.592e15 ≈ 0.8966.

Wait, so the brightness when the spots are visible is about 89.66% of the maximum.

So the fractional dip is 1 - 0.8966 = 0.1034, or about 10.34%.

Wait, but wait. So the amplitude of the variation is (L_max - L_min)/L_max = 0.1034, or ~10.34%.

But wait, the star's brightness varies between L_max and L_min, so the amplitude is (L_max - L_min)/L_max.

Now, the exoplanet's effect: when it transits, it blocks a part of the star's light, leading to a dip of (R_p / R_s)^2.

So to get the same amplitude, (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.1034.

Thus, R_p = R_s * sqrt(0.1034).

Compute sqrt(0.1034):

Well, sqrt(0.1) is ~0.316. Let's compute 0.1034.

Compute 0.32^2 = 0.1024. Close to 0.1034. So sqrt(0.1034) is approximately 0.3215. So R_p is ~0.32 R_s.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute it more accurately.

0.32^2 = 0.1024. 0.3215^2 = (0.32 + 0.0015)^2 = 0.32² + 2*0.32*0.0015 + 0.0015² = 0.1024 + 0.00096 + 0.00000225 ≈ 0.10336. Close to 0.1034.

So R_p ≈ 0.3215 R_s.

Looking at the options:

Option D is ~0.32. So that seems to match.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, in the calculation of L_min, when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the area is 2π R², with 20% spots, 80% unspotted. So the flux is (0.8 * 6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4) multiplied by (π R²) because each hemisphere is 2π R², but wait, no. Wait, when the hemisphere is visible, the area is 2π R². Each point on that area contributes according to its temperature.

Wait, perhaps I should model the flux as the sum of the flux from each part of the hemisphere.

So, for the spotted hemisphere, the flux is:

Flux = (0.8 * (6000^4) + 0.2 * (5000^4)) * ( π R² ) * σ.

Wait, but why π R²? Because the area of a hemisphere is 2 π R², but when you're looking at it, the area you see (from Earth) is π R², the cross-section.

Wait, wait, that's a crucial point. Oh! Because the star is a sphere, the area we see at any time is π R². So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the area we see is π R², but the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere's surface. So the area of the spots on the visible side is 0.2 * (π R²) * (1/2) ? Or wait, the hemisphere's area is 2π R², but the visible area is π R². So the spots are on one hemisphere, so when that hemisphere is facing us, the visible area is π R², of which 20% is covered by spots.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify:

The star's surface has a total area of 4π R². If one hemisphere is spotted (2π R²), and the filling factor is 20%, then the area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the area visible is π R² (the cross-section). So, the fraction of the visible area that is spotted is (0.4π R²) / (4π R²) ) = 0.1, or 10%. Wait, no, because the hemisphere is 2π R², and the spot area is 0.4π R². So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the visible spot area is 0.4π R² * (π R² / 2π R²) )? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So the area visible for spots is 20% of 2π R², which is 0.4π R². But the cross-section we see is π R², so the fraction of the cross-section that's spotted is (0.4π R²) / (π R²) ) = 0.4, or 40% ?

Wait, that can't be right because the cross-section is π R², and the hemisphere is 2π R². So if the spotted area on the hemisphere is 0.4π R², then the fraction of the cross-section that's covered by spots is (0.4π R²) / (π R²) ) = 0.4. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, 40% of the cross-section is spotted.

Wait, but that seems high. The filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So when the hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 20% of the area we can see. So the spotted area on the visible cross-section would be 0.2 * π R² = 0.2π R².

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me model it again.

The star's total surface area is 4π R². The spotted area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R². So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the area of the star that's visible is π R². Out of that, the spots cover 0.4π R²? No, because the spots are spread over the entire 2π R² of the hemisphere. So when that hemisphere is facing us, the visible area is π R², but the spots are spread over π R² (since the hemisphere is 2π R²). So the fraction of the visible area covered by spots is (0.4π R²) / (π R²) ) = 0.4. So 40% of the cross-section is covered by spots.

Wait, that's a big effect. So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, 40% of the area we see is spots. So the brightness when the spots are visible is:

L_min = [ (1 - 0.4) * (6000^4) + 0.4 * (5000^4) ] * π R² * σ.

Wait, that's different from before. Let me recompute that.

So the fraction unspotted in the visible area is 0.6, and spotted is 0.4.

So,

L_min = (0.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4) * π R² * σ.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the spots are on the hemisphere, and when that hemisphere is facing us, we see 0.4π R² of spots. So the fraction is 0.4 of the visible area.

So,

L_min = (0.6 *6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4 ) * π R² * σ.

Similarly, when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire visible area is 6000 K.

So,

L_max = (6000^4 ) * π R² * σ.

So the variation is (L_max - L_min)/L_max.

Compute the ratio:

L_min / L_max = [0.6 *6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4] / 6000^4.

Compute 6000^4 = 1.296e15, 5000^4 = 6.25e14.

So,

0.6 *1.296e15 = 7.776e14.

0.4 *6.25e14 = 2.5e14.

Sum = 7.776e14 + 2.5e14 = 1.0276e15.

Divide by 6000^4 (1.296e15):

1.0276e15 / 1.296e15 ≈ 0.7923.

So L_min = 0.7923 * L_max.

So the dip is (L_max - L_min)/L_max = (1 - 0.7923) = 0.2077, or ~20.77%.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is about 20.77% of the star's maximum brightness.

Wait, that's a bigger dip than I thought earlier because I made a mistake in the area calculation.

So, the dip is about 20.77%.

Now, for the planet to cause the same dip, the dip is (R_p / R_s)^2 = 0.2077.

So R_p = R_s * sqrt(0.2077).

Compute sqrt(0.2077). Let's see, sqrt(0.2) is about 0.447. Sqrt(0.2077) is a bit more than that.

Compute 0.455^2 = ~0.207.

Wait,

0.455^2 = (0.4 + 0.055)^2 = 0.16 + 2*(0.4)(0.055) + 0.055² = 0.16 + 0.044 + 0.003025 = 0.207025.

So sqrt(0.2077) ≈ 0.4555.

So R_p ≈ 0.4555 R_s.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is ~0.39, D is ~0.32. None are around 0.45.

Hmm, that's a problem. What did I do wrong? Let me recheck.

Ah! Wait, in the initial problem statement, it says that the star's brightness variation is caused by the spots, and that this can closely resemble an exoplanet. But the question is, when the star is not covered by spots, what radius of a planet would produce the same amplitude in the light curve.

Wait, but in the star's case, the dip is 20.77%. For the planet, the dip is (R_p/R_s)^2. So if (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.2077, then R_p is sqrt(0.2077) R_s ≈ 0.455 R_s.

But that's not one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the fraction of the star's area that's covered by spots when the spot hemisphere is facing us.

Let me re-express the setup.

The star has a radius R. The total surface area is 4πR².

One hemisphere has spots covering 20% of its area. So the total spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see only the cross-section area of the star, which is π R². So the fraction of the visible area that is spotted is (0.4πR²) / (π R²) ) = 0.4, or 40%.

Wait, so when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, 40% of the area we see is covered by spots.

So the flux from the star in that situation is:

Flux = (area_unspotted * T_unspotted^4) + (area_spotted * T_spotted^4).

Area_unspotted = 60% of the visible area: 0.6 * π R².

Area_spotted = 40% of the visible area: 0.4 * π R².

So,

L_min = (0.6 * π R² * T_unspotted^4) + (0.4 * π R² * T_spotted^4).

L_max is when the other hemisphere is facing us, which has no spots, so L_max = π R² * T_unspotted^4.

So the dip is (L_max - L_min)/L_max.

Compute L_min / L_max:

[0.6 * T_unspotted^4 + 0.4 * T_spotted^4 ] / T_unspotted^4.

T_unspotted is 6000 K, T_spotted is 5000 K.

So,

L_min / L_max = [0.6*(6e3)^4 + 0.4*(5e3)^4 ] / (6e3)^4.

Compute each term:

(6e3)^4 = 1.296e15.

(5e3)^4 = 6.25e14.

So,

0.6 * 1.296e15 = 7.776e14.

0.4 * 6.25e14 = 2.5e14.

Sum: 7.776e14 + 2.5e14 = 1.0276e15.

Divide by 1.296e15: 1.0276e15 / 1.296e15 ≈ 0.7923.

So L_min is ~0.7923 L_max.

So dip is (1 - 0.7923) ≈ 0.2077, which is ~20.77% dip.

So the amplitude is 0.2077.

The planet's dip is (R_p / R_s)^2 = 0.2077.

So R_p = sqrt(0.2077) * R_s ≈ 0.4555 R_s.

But none of the options are around 0.455. The options are A) 0.39, B)0.07, C)0.11, D)0.32.

Hmm, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I confused the filling factor. Let me re-read the question.

The question says the star has a radius equal to the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the fraction of the cross-section that's spotted is 20% of the hemisphere's area relative to the cross-section.

Wait, the cross-section is π R². The hemisphere's area is 2π R².

So, the fraction of the hemisphere's area covered by spots is 20%, so 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

The fraction of the cross-section covered by spots is (0.4π R²) / (π R²) ) = 0.4, so 40%.

So my earlier calculation seems correct. Then, why is the result not matching the options?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the area change due to the planet, not the temperature difference. Wait, the planet is causing a transit, which blocks some light, but the star's brightness without spots would have a certain dip. But in the problem, the spots cause a dip because the spots are cooler, so the dip is due to the lower temperature.

Wait, but the way the problem is phrased, the star's brightness variation is due to spots causing a change in the observed flux. So the observed flux when spots are visible is lower than when they're not. So the dip is 20.77% of the star's flux. The planet's dip is (R_p/R_s)^2, which must equal 0.2077.

So R_p is about 0.455 R_s, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternative approach: the brightness variation due to the spots is a periodic change as the star rotates. The amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the brightness when the spots are on the side we can't see, and when they're on the side we can see.

Wait, when the star rotates so that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is lower. When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is higher.

So the variation is between L_max (unspotted) and L_min (spotted).

So the amplitude is (L_max - L_min)/L_max.

But I calculated that as ~20.77%.

So, the planet's dip is (R_p/R_s)^2, which must equal 0.2077.

But then, R_p is ~0.455 R_s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: ~0.39.

But 0.39^2 is ~0.1521. 0.455^2 is ~0.207.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the dip.

Wait, perhaps the star's brightness when the spots are on the far side is higher than when they are on the near side. So the maximum brightness is when the spots are on the far side, and the minimum is when they're on the near side.

Wait, no, when the spots are on the near side, the brightness is lower because the spots are cooler. So the maximum brightness is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

So the dip is (L_max - L_min)/L_max.

But according to my calculation, that's ~20.77%, which would require a planet with R_p ~0.455 R_s. But that's not one of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the area.

Another approach: perhaps the area covered by spots is 20% of the entire star's surface, not per hemisphere.

Wait, the problem says "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So, the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2π R² =0.4π R².

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the fraction of the cross-section covered by spots is 0.4π R² / (π R²) ) = 0.4.

So when the spots are visible, 40% of the star's disk is covered by cooler spots.

So the brightness in that case is:

L_min = (0.6 * (6000^4) + 0.4 * (5000^4)) * π R² * σ.

L_max = (6000^4) * π R² * σ.

So L_min / L_max = [0.6 *6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4 ] /6000^4.

Which is 0.6 + 0.4*(5000/6000)^4.

Compute (5000/6000) =5/6≈0.8333. (5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4.

Compute 0.8333^2 ≈ 0.6944, then square that: 0.6944^2 ≈0.4823.

So,

0.6 + 0.4 * 0.4823 = 0.6 + 0.19292 = 0.79292.

So L_min is 0.79292 L_max.

Dip is 1 - 0.79292 = 0.20708, or ~20.71%.

So (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.2071 → R_p = sqrt(0.2071) R_s ≈ 0.455 R_s.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made an error in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the question isn't considering the change in brightness due to the temperature difference, but just the area difference. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the star's brightness as the sum of the unspotted and spotted areas, regardless of rotation.

Wait, but the problem states that the star's brightness variation is due to rotation, so when the spots are on the visible side, the brightness is lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the dip due to the spots is the same as the dip due to the planet. So the dip from the spots is (L_unspotted - L_spotted)/L_unspotted.

Wait, but what's the dip when the spots are on the visible side?

Hmm, perhaps I should think of the star as having a certain brightness when a fraction f of its surface is covered by cooler spots.

The total brightness when a fraction f of the surface is covered by spots at T_spot is:

L = L0 * (1 - f) * (T_eff^4) + L0 * f * (T_spot^4),

where L0 is the star's brightness with no spots.

So,

L = L0 [ (1-f) T_eff^4 + f T_spot^4 ].

The variation would be between when the spots are on the far side (f=0) and when they're on the near side (f= f0).

Wait, in this scenario, the star's brightness without any spots is L0.

When the star has spots covering a fraction f of its surface (but only on one hemisphere), the maximum brightness is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, which is L0.

The minimum brightness is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, which is L0 * [ (1-f) T_eff^4 + f T_spot^4 ] / T_eff^4.

Wait, but no, because the effective temperature is an average, but when part of the surface is cooler, the total brightness decreases.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. The star's brightness without spots is L0 = 4π R² σ T_eff^4.

When a fraction f of the surface is covered by spots at T_spot, the total brightness is:

L = (1-f) L0 + f * L_spot,

where L_spot = 4π R² σ T_spot^4 * (f × (1/4π R² )) )? No, perhaps not.

Wait, the total brightness when a fraction f of the surface is covered by spots is:

L = (1-f) * T_eff^4 * (4π R² σ) + f * T_spot^4 * (4π R² σ).

So,

L = 4π R² σ [ (1-f) T_eff^4 + f T_spot^4 ].

The brightness variation would be between when the spots are on the far side (L = L0) and when they're on the near side (L = L0 × [ (1-f) + f (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ]).

So the dip is L0 - L = L0 [ 1 - ( (1-f) + f (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) ].

So the dip fraction is [1 - ( (1-f) + f (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) ].

In our problem, f is the fraction of the visible area covered by spots when the spotted hemisphere is facing us. As earlier, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, f = 0.4, since 40% of the cross-section is covered.

So,

dip_fraction = 1 - [ (1-0.4) + 0.4 * (5000/6000)^4 ].

Compute (5000/6000) = 5/6 ≈0.8333.

(5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So,

dip_fraction = 1 - [0.6 + 0.4 * 0.4823] = 1 - [0.6 + 0.19292] = 1 - 0.79292 = 0.20708, which is the same 20.7% as before.

So, the dip is 20.7% of the star's maximum brightness.

So (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.20708 → R_p = sqrt(0.20708) R_s ≈ 0.455 R_s.

But the options don't include this value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem's setup.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the fraction f. Let's think again.

The filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere. So when that hemisphere is facing us, the fraction of the star's disk covered by spots is 20% of the hemisphere's area, which is 20% of 2π R². But the cross-section is π R², so the fraction of the cross-section covered is (0.2 * 2π R²) / (π R²) ) = 0.4. So f=0.4.

Hmm, that seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the planet's transit as blocking the same amount of flux as the spots' contribution.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the flux from the spots, but the change in brightness when the spots are not facing us.

Wait, when the star is unspotted on the near side, the brightness is higher. So the maximum brightness is when no spots are visible (other hemisphere), and the minimum when spots are visible.

So the amplitude is (L_max - L_min)/L_max = 20.7%.

So the planet's transit must cause the same dip, so (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.207 → R_p ≈ 0.455 R_s.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the star's brightness when the spots are on the far side. Wait, no, because when the spots are on the far side, the brightness would be higher because more of the star's hotter area is visible.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the star's brightness when the spot is on the visible side: when the spots are on the near side, the star's brightness is lower than when they're on the far side.

So the amplitude is the difference between when the spots are on the near and far side.

Wait, but the problem says "the situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet." So perhaps the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same as that of a planet transiting.

So, the dip due to the planet is (R_p/R_s)^2.

The dip due to the spots is (L_max - L_min)/L_max.

But the options don't include a planet radius of ~0.45 R_s. Which makes me think I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the flux from the star when the spots are on the far side. Let's consider that.

When the spots are on the far side, the entire visible hemisphere is unspotted, so the flux is L_max = 4π R² σ (6000)^4 * (1/2) = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

Wait, no. The star's total luminosity is 4π R² σ T^4.

When the spotted hemisphere is on the far side, the flux we receive is from the unspotted hemisphere: which is 2π R² σ T^4.

When the spotted hemisphere is on the near side, the flux is:

(2π R² - 0.4π R²) σ T^4 + 0.4π R² σ (T_spot)^4.

Wait, because the visible area is 2π R², but 0.4π R² is covered by spots.

So,

L_min = (2π R² - 0.4π R² ) σ T^4 + 0.4π R² σ (T_spot)^4.

= (1.6π R² σ T^4 ) + (0.4π R² σ (T_spot)^4 )

= π R² σ [1.6 T^4 + 0.4 (T_spot)^4 ].

Similarly, L_max = 2π R² σ T^4.

So the dip is (L_max - L_min)/L_max.

Compute [ 2π R² σ T^4 - (1.6 π R² σ T^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (T_spot)^4 ) ] / (2 π R² σ T^4 )

= [ 0.4 π R² σ T^4 - 0.4 π R² σ (T_spot)^4 ] / (2 π R² σ T^4 )

= 0.4 [ T^4 - (T_spot)^4 ] / (2 T^4 )

= 0.2 [ 1 - ( (T_spot/T)^4 ) ].

So,

dip = 0.2 [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ].

Compute (5/6)^4 = (0.8333)^4 ≈0.4823.

So,

dip = 0.2 [ 1 - 0.4823 ] = 0.2 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.1035, or ~10.35%.

Ah! So the dip is only ~10.35% of the star's maximum brightness.

Wait, that's a different result. So this approach gives a dip of ~10.35%.

So, this would imply that (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.1035 → R_p ≈ sqrt(0.1035) R_s ≈ 0.3217 R_s.

Which is approximately 0.32, which is option D.

So why the earlier approach gave 20.7% dip? Because I incorrectly assumed that the spotted area on the visible hemisphere was 40% of the cross-section. But according to this latest approach, the dip is 10.35%.

I think the confusion arises from whether the filling factor is per hemisphere or per the entire star.

Wait, the problem states that "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere's area, which is 20% of 2π R².

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the area of the spots on the visible cross-section is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

But the cross-section is π R², so the fraction is 0.4π R² / π R² = 0.4.

Wait, but in the previous approach, the dip was 20.7%, while in this approach, the dip is 10.35%.

I think I'm getting confused between the star's total brightness and the observed brightness when the hemisphere is facing us.

Alternative approach: when the star is viewed from Earth, the flux received is the sum of the flux from the visible hemisphere.

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

Flux = (unspotted area on visible hemisphere)*T_unspotted^4 + (spotted area on visible hemisphere)*T_spot^4.

The unspotted area is (1 - 0.2) * (visible hemisphere area) = 0.8 * 2π R²? Or wait, the visible area is π R², and the spots cover 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2π R² =0.4π R².

So the area of spots on the visible hemisphere is 0.4π R².

But the visible hemisphere's area is 2π R². So the fraction is 0.4π R² / 2π R² = 0.2, or 20%.

Ah! So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, only 20% of the visible hemisphere's area is covered by spots. So the fraction of the cross-section covered by spots is 20% of the hemisphere's area, not 40%.

Wait, this is a key point. Because the spots are on one hemisphere (2π R²), and we're seeing π R² of that hemisphere. So the fraction of the cross-section covered by spots is (0.2 * 2π R²) / (2π R²)) * (π R²/π R²) ) ?

Wait, no. Let's think of it this way: the entire spotted area is 0.2 * 2π R² =0.4π R². When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the cross-section is π R². So the fraction of the cross-section covered by spots is (0.4π R²) / (π R²) ) = 0.4, or 40%.

But according to the latest approach, the dip was 10.35% when using 0.2 of the cross-section being spotted. So there's a contradiction here.

Ah, perhaps I have to model it correctly: when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the fraction of the cross-section covered by spots is 20% of the hemisphere's area, which is 20% of 2π R², so 0.4π R².

But the cross-section is π R², so the fraction is 0.4π R² / π R² =0.4, or 40%.

So the area covered by spots is 40% of the cross-section.

So the flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is:

L_min = (0.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4 ) * π R² σ.

L_max when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us is:

L_max = 6000^4 * π R² σ.

So,

dip = (L_max - L_min)/L_max = [1 - (0.6 + 0.4*(5000/6000)^4 ) ].

Which is 1 - [0.6 + 0.4*(0.4823) ] = 1 - [0.6 + 0.19292] = 1 - 0.79292 = 0.20708, so ~20.7%.

Which brings us back to the earlier result.

But according to the other approach, the dip is only ~10%, when the fraction is 20% of the cross-section.

Hmm, I'm really confused.

Wait, perhaps an alternative way to think about it. Let's compute the average brightness of the star when the spots are present, and compare it to when they're not.

But that's not exactly the same as the brightness variation due to rotation.

Wait, maybe the problem is simpler than I'm making it. The question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots being on the near side, which is the dip compared to when they're on the far side.

So the dip is (L_max - L_min)/L_max.

Earlier calculation gives 20.7% dip.

But according to another approach, I thought the dip was 10.35%.

Which is correct?

Wait, the issue is whether the cross-section when the spotted hemisphere is facing us has 20% of the star's surface area covered by spots, or 40% of the cross-sectional area.

The correct approach is that when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the fraction of the cross-sectional area (π R²) that is spotted is 20% of the hemisphere's area (2π R²), which is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

So the fraction of the cross-section covered by spots is 0.4π R² / π R² = 0.4. So 40% of the cross-sectional area is covered.

So, the earlier approach with a dip of ~20.7% is correct.

But the options don't have 0.45 R_s.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the problem is phrased. The problem asks, "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?"

Ah! So the star without spots would have a certain brightness, and the exoplanet would cause a dip when it transits. The dip would be (R_p/R_s)^2.

The spots cause a dip of 20.7% when the spotted hemisphere is facing us. So the planet's dip must be that same 20.7%.

But the options don't have 0.45.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(0.207).

sqrt(0.207) = approx 0.455.

So R_p = 0.455 R_s.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.39, which is 0.39^2=0.152. Not 0.207.

Option D is ~0.32, which is 0.32^2=0.1024.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the spots as being on only a part of one hemisphere, but the star's rotation causes the spots to come in and out of view, leading to a sinusoidal light curve.

But the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same as that caused by a planet transit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the star's brightness when the spots are on the far side, which would be maximum, and when they're on the near side, which is minimum.

So the dip is (L_max - L_min)/L_max.

Which is 0.207.

So the planet's dip is (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.207 → R_p ≈0.455 R_s.

But the options don't have this, so perhaps I'm missing a key factor.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the change in brightness as the spots rotate into and out of view, leading to a variation in brightness that's similar to a planet's transit. But perhaps the amplitude is different because the star's brightness is modulated by the spots in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the planet's transit would cause a dip of (R_p/R_s)^2, while the star's brightness variation due to spots is (f) × (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4)/T_eff^4.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the change in flux due to the spots being present on the visible hemisphere.

When the spots are on the near side, the flux is:

F = (1 - f) * F_unspotted + f * F_spotted,

where f is the fraction of the visible area covered by spots.

F_unspotted = T_eff^4,

F_spotted = T_spot^4.

So,

F = (1-f) T_eff^4 + f T_spot^4.

The dip is F_unspotted - F = (1 - ( (1-f) T_eff^4 + f T_spot^4 )) / T_eff^4.

So,

dip = [1 - ( (1-f) T_eff^4 + f T_spot^4 ) / T_eff^4 ].

= [ 1 - (1-f) - f (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) ]

= f [ 1 - ( T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) ].

In our case, f = 0.4 (40% coverage), T_spot =5000 K, T_eff=6000 K.

So,

dip = 0.4 × (1 - (5000/6000)^4 ).

= 0.4 × (1 - (5/6)^4 )

= 0.4 × (1 - 0.4823 )

= 0.4 × 0.5177 ≈ 0.207, which is the same as before.

So, dip is 0.207.

So, R_p^2/R_s^2 = 0.207 → R_p = sqrt(0.207) R_s ≈0.455 R_s.

But the options don't include this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the area covered on the entire star, not just the hemisphere. Let me try that.

If the entire star has a filling factor of 20%, then f=0.2.

Then,

dip = 0.2 × (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈0.2 ×0.5177 ≈0.1035.

Which would require R_p ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈0.3217 R_s.

Which is option D.

But the problem states that only one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%.

So why would the dip be 0.1035?

Unless I misunderstood the filling factor.

Ah! Wait, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, not per hemisphere.

In that case, the total spotted area is 0.2 * 4π R² = 0.8π R².

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the fraction of the cross-section covered by spots is (0.8π R²) / (π R²) ) =0.8.

So f=0.8.

So,

dip = 0.8 × (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈0.8 ×0.5177 ≈0.414.

Which would require R_p = sqrt(0.414) ≈0.643 R_s, not matching any options.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. According to the problem statement, the filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere. So when the hemisphere is facing us, 40% of the cross-section is spotted.

Thus, the dip is ~20.7%, requiring R_p ~0.455 R_s.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is option A: 0.39, which is about 0.39^2=0.152.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculate the dip.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the difference in luminosity between the maximum and minimum, and then compare it to the planet's dip.

Wait, the problem says that when the star is not covered by spots, the planet would produce the same amplitude. So the variation caused by the spots is the same as the variation caused by the planet.

So the amplitude is (R_p/R_s)^2.

But according to the earlier calculation, the dip is ~20.7%, so R_p is 0.455 R_s.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I made an error in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the temperature difference. Let me compute the dip assuming that the spots are at the same temperature as the star, but just blocked.

Wait, no, the problem says the spots are cooler, so the brightness is lower.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the area of the spot relative to the entire star.

Wait, if the spots are 20% of the star's area, then f=0.2.

Then,

dip = 0.2 × (1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) ≈0.2 ×0.5177=0.1035.

So R_p= sqrt(0.1035)=~0.3217 R_s.

Which matches option D.

But the problem states that only one hemisphere is covered, so the total spotted area is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 20% of 2π R², not the entire star.

So the total spotted area is 0.4π R².

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the cross-section is π R², so the fraction is 0.4.

Thus, f=0.4, leading to dip of 0.207.

But that's leading to R_p≈0.455 R_s.

Since the options don't have this, perhaps the correct approach is to take f=0.2, leading to option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, not per hemisphere.

In that case, the total spotted area is 0.2 *4π R²=0.8π R².

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the cross-section is π R², so the fraction covered is 0.8π R²/ (π R²) )=0.8.

Thus, f=0.8.

Then, dip =0.8*(1- (5/6)^4 )=0.8*(0.5177)=0.414.

Which would require R_p= sqrt(0.414)= ~0.643 R_s.

No option matches that.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another way. Let me compute the ratio of the brightness when the spots are present on the near side compared to when they are not.

Wait, perhaps the star's brightness without spots is L0 = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

When the spots are on the near side, the brightness is L_min = (0.6 *6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4 ) * π R² σ.

So,

L_min = π R² σ [0.6*(6e3)^4 + 0.4*(5e3)^4 ].

Compute each term:

0.6*(6e3)^4 = 0.6*1.296e15 =7.776e14.

0.4*(5e3)^4=0.4*6.25e14=2.5e14.

Sum: 7.776e14 +2.5e14=1.0276e15.

L_min = π R² σ *1.0276e15.

But L0 =4π R² σ (6e3)^4=4 π R² σ *1.296e15=5.184e15 π R² σ.

So,

L_min / L0 = (1.0276e15 ) / (5.184e15 ) ≈0.198.

Wait, no, that can't be right because L_min is when a part is covered, which should be less than L0.

Wait, no, L_min is when the spots are on the near side, so the brightness is lower than when the spots are on the far side.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, L_min = [0.6*(6e3)^4 + 0.4*(5e3)^4 ] * π R² σ.

Which is (7.776e14 + 2.5e14 ) * π R² σ =1.0276e15 * π R² σ.

L0 is 4 π R² σ (6e3)^4 =4π R² σ *1.296e15=5.184e15 π R² σ.

So,

L_min =1.0276e15 π R² σ.

L_min / L0 = (1.0276e15) / (5.184e15) )= ~0.198.

So, L_min is ~19.8% of L0.

But that can't be right because when the spots are on the near side, the brightness should be lower than when the spots are on the far side, but not that low.

Wait, this suggests that when the spots are on the near side, the star's brightness is ~20% of its normal brightness, which can't be right. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no, L0 is the total brightness of the star, which is 4π R² σ (6e3)^4.

When the spots are on the near side, the star's brightness as seen from Earth is L_min = [0.6*(6e3)^4 + 0.4*(5e3)^4 ] * π R² σ.

Which is a part of the star's total flux.

Wait, perhaps I should compare L_min to L0.

Wait, but L0 is the star's total luminosity. The observed flux when the spots are on the near side is a fraction of that.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the star's total luminosity with the observed flux.

The star's total luminosity is L0 =4 π R² σ T_eff^4.

The observed flux when the spots are on the near side is F_min = [0.6*(6e3)^4 + 0.4*(5e3)^4 ] * σ.

Because the area we see is π R², and each point emits according to its temperature.

The observed flux when the spots are on the far side is F_max = (6e3)^4 * σ.

So the dip is (F_max - F_min)/F_max.

Compute F_min:

= [0.6*(6e3)^4 + 0.4*(5e3)^4 ] * σ.

= [0.6*1.296e15 + 0.4*6.25e14 ] * σ.

= [7.776e14 + 2.5e14 ] * σ.

= 1.0276e15 * σ.

F_max =1.296e15 * σ.

So,

dip = (1.296e15 σ -1.0276e15 σ ) / 1.296e15 σ.

= (2.684e14 σ ) / 1.296e15 σ.

≈0.207, which is ~20.7%.

So the dip is ~20.7%, which requires the planet to have R_p ≈0.455 R_s.

But that's not an option. So perhaps the problem has a mistake, or I'm missing a key point.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are in one hemisphere, but only 20% of the star's total surface is covered.

Wait, if the entire star's surface has 20% spots, then the fraction of the cross-section covered when the spots are on the near side is 20% of the cross-section.

So f=0.2.

Thus,

dip =0.2 × (1- (5/6)^4 )=0.2 ×0.5177≈0.1035.

Which gives R_p≈0.3217 R_s, matching option D.

But the problem says the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere, not the entire star.

Hmm.

Perhaps the correct approach is option D, and I made a mistake in my earlier calculations. But I'm not sure.

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**: The star has a radius equal to the Sun, an effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( 1000 \, \text{K} \), so their temperature is \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Filling Factor**: The filling factor of 20% applies to one hemisphere, meaning the spotted area on that hemisphere is \( 0.2 \times 2\pi R^2 = 0.4\pi R^2 \). When the spotted hemisphere is facing Earth, the fraction of the star's cross-section (\( \pi R^2 \)) covered by spots is \( f = 0.4 \).

3. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The total brightness of the star when the unspotted hemisphere is visible (\( L_{\text{max}} \)) is:
     \[
     L_{\text{max}} = \pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4
     \]
   - The total brightness when the spotted hemisphere is visible (\( L_{\text{min}} \)) is:
     \[
     L_{\text{min}} = \pi R^2 \sigma \left( 0.6 T_{\text{eff}}^4 + 0.4 T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right)
     \]
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation is:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{L_{\text{max}} - L_{\text{min}}}{L_{\text{max}}}
     \]
     Substituting values:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = 1 - \frac{0.6 T_{\text{eff}}^4 + 0.4 T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = 1 - \left( 0.6 + 0.4 \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right)
     \]
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = 1 - \left( 0.6 + 0.4 \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right)
     \]
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = 1 - \left( 0.6 + 0.4 \times 0.4823 \right)
     \]
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = 1 - 0.7929 = 0.2071 \, \text{(or 20.71%)}.
     \]

4. **Exoplanet Brightness Variation**:
   - The brightness variation caused by a transiting exoplanet is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \left( \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
     \]
   - Equating the amplitude caused by the exoplanet to that caused by the spots:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.2071
     \]
     \[
     \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.2071} \approx 0.455
     \]

5. **Mismatch with Options**:
   - The calculated radius ratio (\( \sim 0.455 \)) does not match any of the provided options. However, if the filling factor of 20% is interpreted as applying to the entire star (not just one hemisphere), the fraction of the cross-section covered by spots would be \( f = 0.2 \). Recomputing the amplitude:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = 0.2 \times \left( 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right)
     \]
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = 0.2 \times 0.5177 = 0.1035 \, \text{(or 10.35%)}.
     \]
     \[
     \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.322
     \]
   - This matches **Option D (~0.32)**.

### Conclusion:
The discrepancy arises from the interpretation of the filling factor. If the filling factor applies to the entire star, the closest match is **Option D (~0.32)**.
