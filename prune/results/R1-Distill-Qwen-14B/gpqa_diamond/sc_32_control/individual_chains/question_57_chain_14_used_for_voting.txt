Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my scattering theory, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives me phase shifts δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And the setup is for 50 MeV electrons. The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A to D, all in fm.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) has a partial wave expansion. The general form is something like f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ). Oh right, P_l are the Legendre polynomials.

But wait, the question specifically asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. So θ would be 0 degrees because along the beam means same direction as the incident. So cosθ = 1. The Legendre polynomials P_l(1) give specific values. Let me think: for l=0, P0=1. l=1, P1=1. l=2, P2=0.5, but wait, wait. Wait, P0 is 1, P1 is x (since P_1(x)=x), P_2 is (3x²-1)/2, and so on.

Wait, but when θ is 0 degrees, cosθ is 1. So P_l(1) = 1 for l=0, and for l=1, P_1(1)=1. For l=2, P_2(1)= (3*(1)^2 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1. Hmm, wait, that can't be right. Let me check: For l=0, P_0(x)=1. l=1, P_1(x)=x. l=2, P_2(x)=(3x²-1)/2. So when x=1, P_2(1)= (3*1 -1)/2 = 1. So for l=0,1,2: P_l(1)=1, 1, 1. Wait, is that correct? Wait, no, for l=2, when x=1, it's (3*1 - 1)/2 = (2)/2=1. So yeah, P0=1, P1=1, P2=1, but wait what about l=3? Let me compute P3(1). P3(x)=(5x³ - 3x)/2. At x=1, that's (5-3)/2=1. So for all l, P_l(1)=1? That can't be right because I remember that the Legendre polynomials oscillate. Wait, wait, no. Wait, for integer l, P_l(1)=1. Because of the properties of Legendre polynomials: each P_l(1) equals 1. So that's a key point.

So if θ=0, cosθ=1, and each P_l(1)=1. So the sum becomes Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l * 1. But then the amplitude f is (1/k) multiplied by this sum. Wait, but the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the beam.

So first, f(θ)= (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(1). Since P_l(1)=1, this simplifies to (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l.

But wait, e^{iδ_l} can be expressed as cosδ_l + i sinδ_l. So each term in the sum is (2l+1) [cosδ_l + i sinδ_l] sinδ_l.

Let me expand that: (2l+1)(cosδ_l sinδ_l + i sin²δ_l).

So each term contributes a real part (2l+1) cosδ_l sinδ_l and an imaginary part (2l+1) sin²δ_l.

So the total imaginary part of f(θ) is (1/k) times the sum of (2l+1) sin²δ_l for each l present.

But wait, the phase shifts given are δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, δ₄. So l goes from 0 to 4. So we have to sum for l=0 to 4.

So the imaginary part of f(θ=0) is (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin²δ_l.

Hmm, but what is k? Because k is the wavevector. The electrons are 50 MeV. So we need to compute k in appropriate units.

Wait, electrons have mass m_e = 0.511 MeV/c². The energy is 50 MeV, which is much higher than the rest mass, so relativistic. So k can be approximated using the relativistic expression.

The energy E is given as 50 MeV. The relativistic relation is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)^2. For nonrelativistic speeds, E≈pc for high energies, but since 50 MeV is much larger than 0.511 MeV, we can approximate E ≈ pc. So p≈ E/(c). So k = p/ħ. So k = (E/(c)) / ħ. But let me write it correctly.

Wait, let's do this in cgs units because scattering cross sections are often in terms of fm.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute in natural units where ħ = c =1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using atomic units. Hmm, maybe better to compute k in units of inverse femtometers.

Wait, the scattering amplitude is often expressed in terms of the cross-section. But the question is about the imaginary part of f along the beam direction.

Wait, but in any case, let's compute k. Let me think.

The electron's energy is 50 MeV. Let's compute the momentum. Since E² = (pc)² + (m c²)^2. So p = sqrt(E² - m² c^4)/(c²) ?

Wait, no. Let me get the units right.

E is in MeV. The mass m is 0.511 MeV/c². So E = 50 MeV. So E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2.

So pc = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2) MeV.

Wait, 50 squared is 2500. 0.511 squared is about 0.261. So 2500 - 0.261 is about 2499.739. Square root is about 49.99739 MeV. So pc ≈ 50 MeV. So p ≈ 50 MeV/c.

Then, the wavevector k is given by p = ħ k. So k = p / ħ. So in units where ħ is in MeV s and c is in m/s. Hmm, perhaps it's better to compute k in terms of inverse femtometers.

Wait, what's the value of ħ in units where c=1 and so on?

Wait, perhaps I can recall that 1 fm is 1e-15 meters. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 197.33 MeV fm. Because ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm (since ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV s, but this might vary based on units). Wait, let's make sure.

Actually, ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm. So 1 fm = 1e-15 m. So ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So from p = ħ k, and p ≈ E (since E≈pc for high energies). Wait, for high energy, E ≈ pc, so p ≈ E / c. But using the relation E = ħ ω = ħ c k. So p = ħ k = E / c → k = E/(ħ c). Hmm, wait, substituting E=50 MeV.

Wait, but ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm. So 1/(ħ c) is approximately 1/(197.33 MeV fm) = (1 MeV)^{-1} (fm)^{-1} * (1/197.33). 

Wait, no, in units where E is in MeV, and ħ c is in MeV fm, then k = E / (ħ c) * 1/fm. Because p = E/c (approx), and k = p/ħ. So E is in MeV, p in MeV/c (since E=pc), so p = (50 MeV/c). Then k = p/(ħ) = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ) = (50 / ħ c) * (MeV/(MeV fm)) ) * (1/fm). Because ħ c is in MeV fm.

Thus, k = (50 MeV) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) * (1/fm^{-1}) ) → wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, better to think in terms of formula:

k = p / ħ.

p = (E^2 - m^2 c^4)^{1/2} / c.

But since E is much larger than m c², p ≈ E/c.

So k ≈ (E/c) / ħ.

In terms of units, E is MeV, c is in m/s, ħ is in J s. Let me convert everything to SI units.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the relation ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm. So 1 fm = 1e-15 m.

So, k = p / ħ = (E/c) / ħ. But since E = 50 MeV, and ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm, we can write E/c = (50 MeV) / (c) = (50 MeV) * (1/c) → but ħ c is (197.33 MeV fm), so 1/c = ħ / (197.33 MeV fm ) ?

Wait, perhaps a better way is to write k = E/(ħ c) * 1/(fm).

Wait, let me think again.

Compute k in terms of 1/fm.

We have E = 50 MeV.

ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So E/(ħ c) = 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So k ≈ E/(ħ c) = 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So k ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Wait, is that correct? Because when E is in MeV, ħ c is in MeV fm, so E/(ħ c) gives (MeV)/(MeV fm) ) → 1/fm.

Yes, that makes sense. So k = E/(ħ c) = approximately 0.253 / fm → 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So that's k.

Now, back to the imaginary part of f.

Im(f(θ=0)) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin²δ_l.

So for each l, compute (2l+1)*sin²(δ_l degrees) and sum them, then multiply by 1/k, which is 1/(0.253 fm⁻¹) → which is (1/0.253) fm.

Wait, wait, no. Because (1/k) is (1/(0.253 fm⁻¹)) → 1/(0.253) * fm. So (1/k) is approximately 3.9526 fm.

So let's compute each term:

l=0: (2*0+1) =1. δ₀=90 degrees. sin(90)=1. So term is 1 * (1)^2=1.

l=1: (2*1+1)=3. δ₁=67 degrees. sin(67)≈0.9205. So (0.9205)^2≈0.847. So term is 3 * 0.847 ≈ 2.541.

l=2: 2l+1=5. δ₂=55 degrees. sin(55)≈0.8192. (0.8192)^2≈0.671. 5 * 0.671≈3.355.

l=3: 2l+1=7. δ₃=30 degrees. sin(30)=0.5. Square is 0.25. 7 * 0.25 =1.75.

l=4: 2l+1=9. δ₄=13 degrees. sin(13)≈0.2249. Square is about 0.0506. 9 * 0.0506≈0.455.

Now sum all these terms:

1 + 2.541 = 3.541 → plus 3.355 → 6.896 → plus 1.75 → 8.646 → plus 0.455→ 9.101.

So the sum is approximately 9.101.

Then, multiply by (1/k) which is 3.9526 fm.

So Im(f) = 9.101 * 3.9526 fm ≈ ?

Let me compute 9 * 3.9526 = 35.5734. 0.101 *3.9526≈0.399. Total ≈ 35.5734 +0.399≈35.972 fm.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times larger than my calculation. Hmm, that suggests I might have made a mistake in the units somewhere.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of k. Let's recheck that.

Wait, E=50 MeV.

ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm.

So k = E/(ħ c) → 50 / 197.33 = approx 0.253 fm⁻¹. So 1/k is 1 / 0.253 ≈ 3.9526 fm.

Wait, but perhaps I should have considered that the formula for the scattering amplitude is f = (1/k) sum ... which would mean that (1/k) is in fm, since k is in fm⁻¹.

But in the calculation, the sum is 9.101, so 9.101 * (1/k) = 9.101 *3.9526 ≈ let's compute this accurately.

Compute 3.9526 *9 = 35.5734.

3.9526 *0.101: 3.9526 *0.1=0.39526; 3.9526 *0.001=0.0039526. So 0.39526 +0.0039526≈0.3992. So total is 35.5734 +0.3992≈35.9726 fm.

But the options are 355.351 fm (option B) and others. So I'm getting about 35.97 fm, but the options don't have that. Hmm, what could I have done wrong?

Wait, perhaps I forgot to consider that the scattering amplitude is f(l) = (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l (1/(k)) ), but maybe the sum includes all partial waves up to l=4. Wait, but I did sum up to l=4.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I confused the imaginary part. Let me recheck the expansion.

The imaginary part of f is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin²δ_l.

Yes, that's what I did.

Wait, but looking at the options, 35.97 is not there. The closest is option C: 177.675 fm, which is about half of 355. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of each term.

Let me recompute each term.

l=0: 1 * sin²(90) = 1 *1=1.

l=1: 3 * sin²(67). Let me compute sin(67°) accurately.

Sin(67) is approximately 0.9205. Squared is 0.8473.

3 * 0.8473 = 2.5419.

l=2: 5 * sin²(55). Sin(55) is approx 0.8192. Squared is 0.6710. 5 * 0.6710=3.355.

l=3: 7 * sin²(30). Sin(30)=0.5. Square=0.25. 7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4: 9 * sin²(13). Sin(13)=approx 0.22495. Square≈0.0506. 9 *0.0506≈0.4554.

So sum is 1 + 2.5419=3.5419 +3.355=6.8969 +1.75=8.6469 +0.4554=9.1023.

Sum is approximately 9.1023.

Multiply by (1/k)=3.9526 fm^{-1} → 9.1023 *3.9526 = let's compute this.

9 * 3.9526 = 35.5734.

0.1023 * 3.9526 ≈ approx 0.1023 *3.95 ≈ 0.404 (approx 0.1023 *3=0.3069, 0.1023 *0.95=0.0972. So total 0.4041.

So total is 35.5734 +0.4041=35.9775 fm.

Hmm, nowhere near the options given. The options are about 177, 251, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check. The formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude f is:

Im f = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^L (2l+1) sin²δ_l P_l(1).

But wait, when θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so that's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula uses the sum of (2l+1) sinδ_l e^{iδ_l} or something else. Let me think again.

The partial wave expansion is:

f(θ,φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ) /k.

But when θ=0, cosθ=1, so P_l(1)=1.

So f(θ=0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l.

So f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [cosδ_l + i sinδ_l] sinδ_l.

= (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ cosδ_l sinδ_l + i sin²δ_l ].

So the imaginary part of f is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin²δ_l.

Which is what I computed. So that part seems correct.

Wait, but maybe I forgot that the amplitude is in units where 1/k is in a different unit. Let me think about units again.

Wait, in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f has units of length (since cross-section is |f|^2 multiplied by 4π, but the amplitude itself is in fm).

So when I compute Im(f) as 35.97 fm, that's in the right unit.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I've made a mistake in calculating k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in a different way. Let me think again.

Electron's energy E = 50 MeV.

We have E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ).

So (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2.

m c^2 for electron is 0.511 MeV.

E=50 MeV, so (pc)^2 = (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ≈ (2500 - 0.261) ≈ 2499.739 (MeV)^2.

So pc = sqrt(2499.739) ≈ 49.997 MeV. So p ≈ (50 MeV)/c.

Then, k = p/ħ. Now, ħ is in J·s. But perhaps it's easier to use natural units where ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, since ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm → ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm / c.

So k = p/(ħ) = (50 MeV / c) / (197.33 MeV·fm / c) ) → (50 / 197.33) 1/fm.

Which gives k ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹, as before.

So 1/k = 3.9526 fm.

So the calculation of k seems correct.

But then, the imaginary part is around 35.97 fm, which is not an option.

Wait, looking back at the options:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Wait, my value is about 36 fm, which is not present. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum. Let me recompute each term.

l=0: (2l+1)=1, sin²(90)=1. So term =1*1=1.

l=1: 3 * sin²(67). Let me compute sin(67 degrees) accurately. Let's look it up.

Sin(67°) is approximately 0.92050485345.

So sin²(67) ≈ (0.9205)^2 ≈0.847.

So 3 * 0.847 = 2.541.

l=2: 5 * sin²(55). Sin(55) is about 0.81915204428.

Sin²(55) ≈ 0.671.

5 * 0.671=3.355.

l=3: 7 * sin²(30).

Sin(30)=0.5, so squared is 0.25. 7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin²(13). Sin(13)= approx 0.2249510543.

Sin²(13)= (0.22495)^2 ≈ 0.050595.

9 * 0.050595 ≈0.455355.

Summing these:

1 +2.541=3.541 → +3.355=6.896 → +1.75=8.646 → +0.455355≈9.101355.

So the sum is approximately 9.101355.

So Im(f)=9.101355 * (1/k) =9.101355 *3.9526.

Wait, let me compute 9.101355 *3.9526.

3.9526 *9= 35.5734.

3.9526 *0.101355 = let's compute 0.101355 *3.9526.

0.1 *3.9526=0.39526.

0.001355 *3.9526 ≈ 0.00535.

So total is approximately 0.39526 + 0.00535≈0.4006.

So total Im(f)≈35.5734 +0.4006=35.974 fm.

Hmm, still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the phase shifts are given in degrees, but perhaps they should be in radians. Oh! Wait, that's a critical point.

Wait, in scattering theory, the phase shifts δ_l are in radians when used in the formula for f. Because the exponential uses e^{iδ_l}, which requires δ_l in radians.

Oh, wait, I used the phase shifts given in degrees, which is incorrect. I should have converted them to radians before calculating sin(δ_l).

Oh man, that's a big mistake. I thought the phase shifts were given in degrees, but in the formula, they must be in radians.

So I need to convert each δ_l from degrees to radians.

Let's do that.

δ₀=90 degrees: 90 * π/180 = π/2 ≈1.5708 radians.

δ₁=67 degrees: 67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 radians.

δ₂=55 degrees: 55 * π/180 ≈0.95993 radians.

δ₃=30 degrees:30 * π/180= π/6≈0.523599 radians.

δ₄=13 degrees: 13 * π/180 ≈0.226893 radians.

Now, compute sin(δ_l) for each l.

l=0: sin(1.5708)=1. So sin²=1.

l=1: sin(1.16937)= approx 0.9165 (wait, precise value? Let me think. 67 degrees is around 0.9205 in sin, but in radians, perhaps using a calculator.

Wait, for radians, sin(1.16937):

Using calculator: 1.16937 radians is approximately 67 degrees. So sin(67°)=0.9205 when in degrees. But when in radians, let me compute it accurately.

Wait, 1.16937 radians: let's compute sin(1.16937):

Using a calculator, sin(1.16937) ≈ sin(67°)=0.9205. So same as before.

Wait, but wait, I'm mixing units. Because when δ is in radians, the sin is the same as for degrees? No, no, sin takes the angle in radians. So if you have 67 degrees, to compute sin, you must convert to radians.

Wait, wait: no, when we use δ in radians, sin(δ) is sin(radians). So for δ=67 degrees, which is approximately 1.16937 radians, so sin(1.16937)= approx 0.9205, same as in degrees because the function doesn't care about the unit representation—it's the angle that matters.

Wait, that's correct. Because sin(67 degrees) is the same as sin(1.16937 radians). So the value of sin is the same regardless of whether the angle is expressed in degrees or radians. So my earlier calculation remains the same.

Wait, but then why would the option not match? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the imaginary part.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula uses the sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) instead of sin²(δ_l). Because sometimes when you have terms like e^{iδ} sinδ, which gives cosδ sinδ + i sin²δ.

Wait, no, in this case, the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin²δ_l. So perhaps this was correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the absolute value of the imaginary part, but that's the same as what I computed.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is not for the scattering amplitude f, but for something else. Another possibility: perhaps it's the imaginary part of the optical theorem, but no, the question is about the scattering amplitude.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part of the amplitude times k, but the formula is Im(f) = (1/k) sum(...), so Im(f) is in 1/(fm) * fm, which is dimensionless? No, wait, k is in 1/fm, so (1/k) is in fm. So Im(f) is in fm.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of 1/k.

Wait, if k = 0.253 fm⁻¹, then 1/k = 3.9526 fm.

So Im(f) = 9.101355 *3.9526 fm ≈35.97 fm.

But the options are much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula of the scattering amplitude.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the phase shifts without the 1/k factor. But that would give a much larger value, but the options don't line up either.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part is part of the amplitude, and the options are in units of 10^5 fm or something. But that doesn't make sense because option A is 87163 fm, which is like 8.7e4 fm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me recompute k.

E=50 MeV.

Using E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ), and mc²=0.511 MeV.

So (pc)^2 = 50^2 - 0.511^2 ≈2500 -0.261=2499.739.

pc = sqrt(2499.739)≈49.997 MeV.

Then, p=49.997 MeV/c.

k = p/(ħ).

But ħ c =197.33 MeV fm → so ħ =197.33 MeV fm / c.

So k= (49.997 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c) )= (49.997 /197.33) 1/fm.

Which is 0.253 fm⁻¹, as before.

Hmm, same result.

Wait, maybe the correct formula for Im(f) is sum (2l+1) sin²δ_l multiplied by (1/k) → which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l). Because sometimes in partial wave expansions, terms involve sin(2δ_l). Let me think.

No, the expansion is f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ).

So the imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin²δ_l.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should be using |f|, but the question specifically asks for the imaginary part.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the total cross section, but no, the question is about the scattering amplitude.

Hmm. I'm not seeing where the mistake is. My calculation leads me to approximately 36 fm, but the options don't have that. Let's see what the options are.

Option B is 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times larger than my result. So perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shifts' exponents.

Wait, wait, let me look at the phase shifts again: δ₀=90, δ₁=67, δ₂=55, δ₃=30, δ₄=13.

So l=0:90°, l=1:67, l=2:55, l=3:30, l=4:13.

Wait, perhaps some of the higher l's contribute more. But I think I accounted for all l up to l=4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in converting degrees to radians, but as I thought earlier, the sin() function uses the angle in radians but the value is the same as when expressed in degrees if the actual angle is the same. So that shouldn't change the result.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the calculation to use the first few terms, like up to l=2, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

Wait, let me recompute the sum.

Sum = (1 * 1) + (3 * sin²(67)) + (5 * sin²(55)) + (7 * sin²(30)) + (9 * sin²(13)).

Wait, perhaps I should compute each term more accurately.

Compute each term:

l=0:

(2*0+1)=1.

sin²(90)=1.

Term:1 *1 =1.

l=1:

(2*1+1)=3.

sin(67°)=0.92050485345.

sin²=0.8473145.

Term:3 * 0.8473145≈2.5419435.

l=2:

(2*2+1)=5.

sin(55)=0.81915204428.

sin²=0.6710345.

Term:5 *0.6710345≈3.3551725.

l=3:

(2*3+1)=7.

sin(30)=0.5.

sin²=0.25.

Term:7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:

(2*4+1)=9.

sin(13)=0.2249510543.

sin²=0.0505981.

Term:9 *0.0505981≈0.455383.

Sum all terms:

1 +2.5419435 =3.5419435.

3.5419435 +3.3551725=6.897116.

6.897116 +1.75=8.647116.

8.647116 +0.455383≈9.102499.

So sum is approximately 9.1025.

Multiply by 3.9526 fm:

9.1025 *3.9526 ≈ let's compute this precisely.

9 *3.9526 =35.5734.

0.1025 *3.9526 =0.4045475.

Total:35.5734 +0.4045475=35.9779475 fm.

So approximately 35.98 fm.

But the options are much larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts given are in units where they are in multiples of π, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given for partial waves l=0,1,2,3,4, but in the formula, I should include all l's up to some maximum, but the question says to ignore the rest, so only up to l=4.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l), but no, the formula is sin²δ_l.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that some terms are negative, but phase shifts are given as positive angles, so their sines are positive.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of f is actually (sum (2l+1) sin²δ_l ) /k.

Which is what I did. So that's correct.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm, 35.98 fm is closest to option C, which is 177.675 fm. But wait, 35.98 is about 1/5 of 177.675.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me compute k again.

E=50 MeV.

p = sqrt(E² - m² c^4) / c → sqrt(50² -0.511²) ≈50 MeV.

So p ≈50 MeV/c.

k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / ħ.

But ħ c =197.33 MeV fm → so ħ =197.33 MeV fm /c.

So k = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm /c) ) = (50 /197.33) (1/fm) → 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So 1/k is 3.9526 fm.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should be done in a different way, perhaps using the relation k = (2mE)/(ħ^2) )^{1/2}, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: compute the wavelength λ = 2π/k.

But I don't think that's necessary here.

Another possibility: perhaps the formula for Im(f) is sum (2l+1) sinδ_l cosδ_l, which would be sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l)/2. But that would make the sum different.

Wait, but no, the imaginary part would be sum (2l+1) sin²δ_l.

Hmm. I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should consider that I'm using the wrong formula and that the imaginary part is actually k times the sum. Because if I have Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin²δ_l, then:

Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin²δ_l.

But then with sum 9.1025, and no 1/k factor, which would give Im(f)=9.1025, which is in 1/fm. But that doesn't make sense because the amplitude is in length units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply by k instead of 1/k. Let's see:

sum is 9.1025, multiplied by k=0.253 fm⁻¹ → 9.1025 *0.253≈2.305 fm⁻¹. That doesn't make sense either.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, let me think about the options again. Option B is about 355.35 fm, which is about 10 times my calculated 35.97 fm. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps in the calculation of k, I forgot to account for something. Let me recheck.

Wait, the relation between ħ c and MeV fm. I've used ħ c =197.33 MeV fm. But sometimes it's given as 197.33 MeV fm⁻¹. No, that's not right. Because ħ c has units of MeV·fm.

So, yes, ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So, with E=50 MeV, k = E/(ħ c) =50/(197.33) fm⁻¹ → 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but what if I made a mistake and used 197.33 MeV⁻¹ fm? No, that wouldn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used E = ħ c k → k=E/(ħ c).

Wait, that's correct. So no mistake there.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is that the formula I used is for the differential cross-section, but no, the question is about the scattering amplitude.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the scattering amplitude is f = (1/k) sum ... but perhaps I should have considered the sum as (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l, and then the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin²δ_l. But that's what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum should be in terms of e^{iδ_l} (i.e., including the exponential), but I'm only taking the imaginary part, which includes the sin² terms.

Hmm. I'm not seeing the mistake.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ).

But when θ=0, cosθ=1, and P_l(1)=1. So f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sinδ_l.

The imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin²δ_l.

Which is what I calculated.

Hmm. Perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in the problem's parameters.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the phase shifts are given as δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55, δ₃=30, δ₄=13°. Did I make a typo in the l indices? No, I think I used l=0 to 4 correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should multiply by 2 somewhere. Let me see.

Wait, no, the formula is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question asks for the real part, but no, it's about the imaginary part.

Hmm. I'm not sure where the mistake is, but perhaps I should proceed with the initial calculation and see which option is closest.

But none of the options are near 35.97 fm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to consider that the scattering amplitude is 4π times f. No, that’s for the cross-section.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the total scattering amplitude, but that’s unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should include a factor of 2 in the sum. Let me check.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin²δ_l / (2k).

Which would make the result half of what I calculated. 35.97/2≈17.98 fm. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses (2l+1) sinδ_l, not sin²δ_l. Let me compute that.

sum (2l+1) sinδ_l.

l=0:1*1=1.

l=1:3*0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5*0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9*0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum:1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096≈7.8575 +3.5≈11.3575 +2.02455≈13.382.

Multiply by (1/k)=3.9526: 13.382 *3.9526≈52.81 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe the correct answer is option B) 355.351 fm, but my calculation doesn't support that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 1/k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k using a different approach. Let me compute it using the electron's momentum.

The electron's momentum p = gamma m v. But perhaps it's easier to compute using E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ).

E=50 MeV, m c^2=0.511 MeV.

So (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2 = (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ≈2500 -0.261≈2499.739 MeV².

So p c = sqrt(2499.739) ≈49.997 MeV.

p =49.997 MeV / c.

k = p / ħ = (49.997 MeV/c) / (ħ).

But ħ c =197.33 MeV fm → so ħ =197.33 MeV fm / c.

So k = (49.997 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c) )= (49.997 /197.33) 1/fm ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

So same result.

Wait, perhaps I should have used E = pc, which would make p =50 MeV/c. Then k =50/(197.33) ≈0.253 fm⁻¹. Same again.

Hmm. I'm beginning to think that perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to use the real part, but that's a guess.

Wait, let me try to see what would give option B:355.351 fm.

If Im(f)=355.351 fm, then (sum (2l+1) sin²δ_l )=355.351 *k.

k=0.253 fm⁻¹.

So sum =355.351 *0.253 ≈89.843.

So sum would be 89.843.

But my sum is only ~9.1025.

So 89.843/9.1025≈9.866 times larger.

That's a factor of about 10.

Hmm. Where could a factor of 10 come from? Perhaps I forgot to multiply by 10 in some unit conversion.

Wait, perhaps when computing k, I should have used E in keV instead of MeV. No, that would make it much larger.

Wait, perhaps I should have multiplied by 10^something. Let me think.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are given in units of π radians. For example, δ₀=90°= π/2 radians, δ₁=67°= (67/180)*π ≈ 1.16937 radians, but perhaps the phase shifts are given in units where π=1. So that would be a problem.

Wait, that would be a possibility. So if the phase shifts are in units of π.

Wait, for example, δ₀=90° would be 0.5 in π units, because 90°=π/2.

So let me recompute the sum with this assumption.

Compute each term as (2l+1) sin²(δ_l * π/180).

Wait, but earlier I thought that's the same as what I did before. So perhaps that's not the issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are in units where π=180, but that's not likely.

Hmm. I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to proceed with the calculation I have, even though it doesn't match the options.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we use the partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude:

\[
f(\theta) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i\delta_l} \sin\delta_l P_l(\cos\theta),
\]

where \(P_l(\cos\theta)\) are the Legendre polynomials. For \(\theta = 0^\circ\), \(\cos\theta = 1\), and \(P_l(1) = 1\) for all \(l\). Thus, the imaginary part of \(f(0)\) is given by:

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \(k\)
The wavevector \(k\) is related to the electron's momentum \(p\) and the reduced Planck constant \(\hbar\) by \(k = p / \hbar\). The momentum \(p\) is derived from the energy \(E = 50 \, \text{MeV}\) using the relativistic relation:

\[
E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.
\]

Here, \(m c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV}\). Solving for \(pc\):

\[
(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2 = 50^2 - 0.511^2 \approx 2500 - 0.261 = 2499.739 \, \text{MeV}^2,
\]
\[
pc = \sqrt{2499.739} \approx 49.997 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus, \(p \approx 49.997 \, \text{MeV}/c\). Using \(\hbar c = 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm}\), we find:

\[
k = \frac{p}{\hbar} = \frac{49.997}{197.33} \, \text{fm}^{-1} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the sum
The phase shifts are given as \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ\). For each \(l\), compute \((2l+1)\sin^2\delta_l\):

- \(l=0\): \((2(0)+1)\sin^2(90^\circ) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\),
- \(l=1\): \((2(1)+1)\sin^2(67^\circ) = 3 \cdot (0.9205)^2 \approx 3 \cdot 0.847 = 2.541\),
- \(l=2\): \((2(2)+1)\sin^2(55^\circ) = 5 \cdot (0.8192)^2 \approx 5 \cdot 0.671 = 3.355\),
- \(l=3\): \((2(3)+1)\sin^2(30^\circ) = 7 \cdot (0.5)^2 = 7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75\),
- \(l=4\): \((2(4)+1)\sin^2(13^\circ) = 9 \cdot (0.22495)^2 \approx 9 \cdot 0.0506 = 0.455\).

Summing these terms:

\[
\text{Sum} = 1 + 2.541 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.455 \approx 9.101.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \(\text{Im}[f(0)]\)
The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{k} \cdot \text{Sum} = \frac{9.101}{0.253} \, \text{fm} \approx 35.97 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
The calculated value of \(\text{Im}[f(0)] \approx 35.97 \, \text{fm}\) does not match any of the provided options. The closest option is **C) 177.675 fm**, which is approximately 5 times larger than the computed value. This discrepancy suggests a possible error in the problem setup, such as missing phase shifts or incorrect units. However, based on the given options, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: C**
