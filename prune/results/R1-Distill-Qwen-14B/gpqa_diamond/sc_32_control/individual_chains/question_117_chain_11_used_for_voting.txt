Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about isomers, specifically optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism has to do with molecules being non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? So these are chiral centers, maybe. Let me see each option and think through them.

The question lists four organic compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are combinations of these four, labeled 1 to 4.

Let's go through each one.

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Okay, so biphenyls can have stereoisomerism if there's a possibility of different configurations. Wait, biphenyls have a central single bond, so the two benzene rings can rotate. But in some cases, they can have atropisomers if the rotation is hindered. But for atropisomerism, the substituents on each ring need to be in such a way that the molecule can't rotate to look the same. So if the substituents are in positions that make the rotation impossible, that can lead to isomerism.

Looking at the substituents: nitrile groups at 6 and 6' (but wait, the formula says 6,6'-dinitro, so each ring has a nitro at position 6. Also, the 2,2' positions have carboxylate ester groups (since it's a dimethyl ester). So the molecule is symmetric? Because each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So the two rings are identical in their substitution. Would that symmetry prevent optical isomerism?

Wait, but the biphenyl itself, if the substituents are in positions that allow for a plane of symmetry, then maybe not. If the substituents are in positions that make the molecule symmetric, then perhaps it's not chiral. But if the substituents make it so that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it can have optical isomers.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of atropisomerism. For atropisomers, the hindered rotation around the central bond leads to different conformers being possible. To have atropisomers, the molecule must have a sufficiently high barrier to rotation, so that the two possible staggered conformations are distinct. The substituents must be in positions that prevent free rotation. So for instance, if the substituents on each benzene ring are in such a way that when the rings are rotated, the substituents can't be aligned in the same way.

In this case, the substituents are at 6 and 2 on each ring. Let's see: if the rings are connected at 1 and 1', then positions 2 and 6 are on the same benzene ring. So, substituting each ring at 2 and 6, in the same way. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carbonyl (ester) at 2. Wait, if each ring is identical, then perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If so, it's not chiral. But wait, the molecule is dimethyl, so each ester is OMe. If the arrangement of the substituents doesn't allow for a plane of symmetry, then the molecule could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry between the two rings. Hmm. Not sure. Maybe I'll come back to this after looking at the others.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break this down. The structure is CH2(COOH)CH(OH)CH3. Wait, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is: the acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. But as the ester, it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So the molecule is (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, so the structure is like this: the central carbon is the one with the hydroxyl group. So the group attached to the hydroxyl is CH2CH3? No, wait. Let me think. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, wait. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but the formula given is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which would be methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but that's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Does that have a chiral center? The carbon with the OH is attached to two CH2 groups? Let me see:

The structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- OH

- CH2COOCH3

- two CH2 groups? Or wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So it's:

O

|

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon of propanoate.

So propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-.

So as the ester, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the molecule is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

Wait, but that would mean the hydroxyl is on a carbon that's attached to two CH2 groups and a COOCH3 group. Wait, but how many substituents are on that carbon? Let me draw it.

The carbon with OH is connected to:

- OH

- CH2COOCH3

- two CH2 groups?

Wait, no. If it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, then the structure is:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- OH

- two CH2 groups (one on each side, so CH2- on one side and -CH2 on the other)

- and the COOCH3 group.

Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again. The molecule is 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is HOCH2CH2COOH. As the ester, it's HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- OH

- two CH2 groups (from the left and the right?)

Wait, no. The structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- OH

- CH2COOCH3 (as a substituent on one side)

- CH3 (on the other side?) Wait, no.

Wait, maybe the structure is: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbon with OH is connected to two CH2 groups: one leading to the next CH2, which is attached to the COOCH3 group, and the other leading to CH3? No, wait, the propanoate is three carbons: COOCH3 is the first, then a CH2, then another CH2 with OH, as in:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

Wait, that's three carbons in the chain: COOCH3 is the first (carbonyl), then two CH2 groups, but one of them has an OH.

Wait, the structure is:

CH3-COO-OCH3 ? No, no. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, wait, the actual structure of the ester is:

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, wait: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3C(OH)HCOOH? No, wait. The correct structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the molecule is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

Looking for chiral centers. The carbon with OH: what's attached to it?

The carbon with OH is the first CH2 in the chain. So it's attached to:

- OH

- CH2 (on the other side)

- COOCH3 (wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the first carbon is CH2(OH), connected to the next carbon (CH2), which is connected to the COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps that carbon (the one with OH) is CH2(OH), with the other substituents being two CH2 groups and a COOCH3.

Wait, no, maybe I should number the carbons. Let's see:

COOCH3 is the first carbon (carbon 1), then the next carbon (carbon 2) is CH2, and the third carbon (carbon 3) is CH2(OH). So the structure would be:

COOCH3 connected to CH2 connected to CH2(OH).

Wait, that's not possible because that would be a four-carbon chain. Hmm, perhaps I need to re-examine.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate: the propanoate has three carbons. The carboxylic acid group is on carbon 1, then carbon 2 is the middle carbon, which has the OH, and carbon 3 is the end.

So, the structure is:

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: CH(OH)

Carbon 3: CH3? No, wait, wait: propanoate is CH3CH2COO-.

Wait, no: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Oh wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the structure is:

Carboxylic acid group (COOH) on carbon 1, then two more carbons: carbon 2 and 3.

So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH.

So the ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

So the carbon in the middle (the one with the OH) is connected to:

- OH

- two CH2 groups (one on each side)

- and a CH2COOCH3 group.

Wait, no. The middle carbon is CH2 in the chain: so it's connected to:

- OH

- two CH2 groups (left and right), but wait, no. Wait, the middle carbon is CH2, so it has four substituents:

Wait, the middle carbon is CH2, so it's connected to:

- the OH group

- the CH2 group on the left (which is connected to the COOCH3)

- the CH2 group on the right (which is connected to the OH)

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the molecule:

HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

So the middle carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to:

- OH

- two CH2 groups (the carbons on either side)

- and the COOCH3 group?

Wait, no. The middle carbon is CH2, so each of its bonds is to:

- OH, 

- a CH2 group leading to the COOCH3,

- a CH2 group leading to the other side (but that's just a CH3? Or perhaps another CH2?)

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the molecule as:

The carbon chain is: COOCH3-CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, but that's impossible because the chain would be too long. Hmm. Maybe I should just think about whether the molecule has a chiral center.

The carbon with the OH is the second carbon in the chain. So, it's connected to:

- OH,

- a CH2 group on one side (connected to the COOCH3 group),

- and a CH2 group on the other side (connected to the next carbon, which is the third carbon, but that's just a CH3, perhaps). Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps the structure is: the carboxylic acid is on the first carbon, the OH on the second, and the third is a methyl group? No, that doesn't make sense. Because propanoate would have three carbons.

Wait, maybe I should just look up the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Oh wait, I can't do that, but I'm just trying to figure it out.

Alternatively, maybe it's simpler to think about whether this compound has a chiral center. A chiral center requires four different substituents.

So, if the carbon with OH has four different groups attached, then it's a chiral center, and the molecule can exhibit optical isomerism.

In this case, the carbon with OH is connected to:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two CH2 groups? Or perhaps one CH2 and another group.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as:

The molecule is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no, that would be 3-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, no. Wait, I think I'm getting confused about the numbering. Let me think again.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. No, that's incorrect. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH, which is:

CH3-CH2-COOH.

So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)-CH2-COOH.

So the ester would be CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So the structure is:

COOCH3 connected to CH2 connected to CH2(OH).

So the middle carbon is the CH2(OH), which is connected to:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (one leading to COOCH3 and another leading to the end),

Wait, no, the middle carbon is CH2(OH), which is connected to:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (one on each side), and

Wait, but a CH2 group can't have four substituents. Wait, no, each carbon has four bonds.

Wait, the middle carbon is CH2(OH), so it's connected to:

- OH,

- the CH2 group on the left (connected to COOCH3),

- the CH2 group on the right (connected to what?), and

- another H?

Wait, perhaps I should imagine this as:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

Wait, that's three carbons in a row. So the middle carbon is CH2, but that's not correct because in 2-hydroxypropanoate, the OH is on the middle carbon of the three-carbon chain.

Wait, no, the structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-OH.

But that would mean the OH is on the third carbon. That's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

So the middle carbon is CH2, but with substituents:

- HO,

- CH2-,

- CH2-COOCH3,

and maybe a hydrogen.

Wait, but that's three substituents. No, each carbon has four bonds. So the middle carbon is CH2, which would have two Hs, one connected to the HO group, and one connected to the COOCH3 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

So the middle carbon is CH2, with substituents as follows:

- Two H's,

- One CH2 connected to the HO,

- One CH2 connected to the COOCH3.

Wait, but that would make the middle carbon have two CH2 groups attached. So in that case, the substituents on the middle carbon are:

- HO-CH2,

- CH2-COOCH3,

- two H's.

But that would mean there are only three different groups attached to the middle carbon, because the two Hs are the same. So the middle carbon would have: H, H, CH2-OH, CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, but then that's only three different substituents. So it's not a chiral center because it's missing the fourth different group.

Wait, but where's the fourth group? The middle carbon is connected to:

1. Two Hs,

2. CH2-OH,

3. CH2-COOCH3.

So that's three substituents, plus the fourth is another H. So all four substituents: two Hs, one CH2OH, one CH2COOCH3.

So two of the substituents are the same (the Hs). Therefore, the middle carbon isn't a chiral center because it doesn't have four different groups.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if the substituents are two Hs, a CH2OH, and a CH2COOCH3, then the middle carbon has two identical substituents (the Hs). So that's three distinct substituents, not four. Therefore, it's not a chiral center, so the molecule doesn't have optical isomerism.

But wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again. If the middle carbon has two Hs, one CH2OH, and one CH2COOCH3, then the substituents are:

- H,

- H,

- CH2OH,

- CH2COOCH3.

So yes, two Hs are same, so only three different groups. So no chiral center, so no optical isomerism. Therefore, option 2 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait a second. Maybe I made a mistake in the structure. Let me think again. The compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid.

Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be on the CH2 group. So it's CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

The ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

Now, the middle carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (left and right),

- and a COOCH3 group.

Wait, no. The left side is CH2, which is connected to the COOCH3, and the right side is CH2, which is connected to the OH.

Wait, perhaps the middle carbon is CH2, but that can't be because in the structure, the middle carbon is the one with the OH.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3 is on carbon 1,

carbon 2 is CH2,

carbon 3 is CH(OH).

Wait, but that would require a three-carbon chain. So the structure is COOCH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3?

No, that would be four carbons. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the middle carbon is CH(OH), connected to two CH2 groups and a COOCH3.

Wait, maybe it's better to look for another approach. Since I'm stuck on option 2, perhaps I can proceed with the other options and see if that helps.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. So it's two benzene rings connected to a ketone. Benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers, so it can't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but wait: does it have any other kind of stereoisomerism?

Benzophenone has a carbonyl group, but no stereogenic centers. So it can't have optical isomerism. Therefore, option 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the cis-dimer of maleic acid. Wait, wait. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer, and maleic acid is the cis. So dimethyl fumarate would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, wait, no. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is:

O

||
O-C-OCH3

          \ /
           C=C
          / \
         O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, the correct structure for fumarate is the trans form, meaning the two ester groups are on opposite sides. So the molecule has a double bond and the two substituents (ester groups) on opposite sides.

But wait, for a diester like dimethyl fumarate, if the two ester groups are on opposite sides, then the molecule is not planar and can have E/Z isomerism. But wait, in this case, the E/Z isomerism is for the double bond.

Wait, but can it have stereoisomerism due to the configuration around the double bond? Fumarate is the trans isomer, so when you have two ester groups attached across a double bond, in the trans configuration.

Wait, but in the case of fumarate, it's the trans diastereomer. So the molecule has E configuration.

But can that lead to optical isomerism? No, because E and Z isomerism is about the arrangement around a double bond, which is a different type of isomerism (geometric isomerism), not optical isomerism. Optical isomerism arises from chiral centers, not from double bonds.

Wait, but wait. Could the molecule have a chiral center? Let's think about the structure.

Dimethyl fumarate is:

O

||
O-C-OCH3

          \ /
           C=C 
          / \
         O-C-OCH3

But in the trans configuration, so the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So each ester group is on a different carbon, and each has two methyl groups from the ester.

Wait, but in this structure, do any of the carbons have four different substituents? Let's see.

Each of the carbons in the double bond (the two middle carbons) are each connected to:

- an oxygen (from the ester group),

- two methyl groups (from the ester OMe),

- and double bond to the other carbon.

Wait, but the double bond's carbons each have two substituents: the ester group and a methyl group (or perhaps two ester groups? No, dimethyl fumarate would have each ester group on each of the two carbons of the double bond.

Wait, no, dimethyl fumarate is the diester where each of the two carboxylic acid groups in fumaric acid are esterified with methanol. So fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H (no, wait, no, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H, but in the trans configuration.

Wait, no, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H, with the two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

So, when esterified with methanol, each COOH becomes COOCH3, so the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3, but in the trans configuration.

Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, but in the trans configuration, so the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is (Z)- or (E)-? No, wait, no, fumaric acid is the trans (E) isomer. So dimethyl fumarate would have the two ester groups across from each other, on opposite sides of the double bond.

So the structure is:

O=C-OCH3

|
CH2-CH2
|
O=C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. The correct structure is:

The two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So each of the middle carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to an ester group and a CH2 (or another double bond).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as:

Each of the two middle carbons (C1 and C2) in the double bond (C1=C2) is connected to one ester group (COOCH3) and two CH2 groups (but wait, no, because in fumarate, the structure is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H in trans, so when esterified, it becomes COOCH3 on each end.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for whether dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center.

Each of the carbons in the double bond (C1 and C2) is connected to:

- COOCH3,

- two CH2 groups, but wait, no. Let me think. If the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, that's a single bond, but in fumarate, it's a double bond.

Wait, no, the correct structure for fumarate is:

HO2C-C(R)=C(R)-CO2H, where R groups are in trans configuration.

So when esterified, it's OMe on each COO group. So the structure is:

COOCH3-C(R)=C(R)-COOCH3, with R groups in trans.

Each R group is a CH2 group? Or perhaps in this case, each R is a methyl group from the ester.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate has the structure where two opposite ester groups are attached to a double bond.

Each of the double bond carbons is connected to an ester group and a CH2 group. Wait, but that would make each of those carbons have three substituents plus a double bond. So each has:

- COOCH3,

- CH2,

- double bond to the other carbon.

But that's only three substituents. Oh wait, each double bond carbon has two substituents: one COOCH3 and one CH2 group. No, that can't be right because each carbon in the double bond has two substituents. So each has:

- COOCH3,

- CH2,

and the double bond.

Wait, but that's three substituents. So, each of the double bond carbons has three substituents plus the double bond. Hmm, but that's not possible because each carbon can have only four bonds.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think of the structure as:

Each of the two middle carbons (C1 and C2) is connected via a double bond. Each has a COOCH3 group and two CH2 groups.

So, for example, C1 is connected to COOCH3, CH2CH3, and double bond to C2. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps each double bond carbon is connected to two ester groups, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should give up on this and think about the possibility of a chiral center in dimethyl fumarate. If the molecule has a chiral center, then it can exhibit optical isomerism. Does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center?

Looking at the structure, each of the double bond carbons is connected to:

- COOCH3,

- two CH2 groups,

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps each of those carbons is connected to two ester groups, but that's not possible because it's a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the molecule as having a central double bond, and each of the two carbons in the double bond has an ester group on each side.

Wait, for example, the structure is O=C-OCH3 connected to each end of the double bond. But that would mean the double bond is between the two carbonyl carbons, which is not possible because that would be a conjugated dienone, but fumarate is a diester of a diacid.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O

||

O-C-OCH3

|

C=C

|

O-C-OCH3

Wait, that would make a structure where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. But each of the C=O groups is connected to an OCH3, so each of the carbons in the double bond is connected to a carbonyl group and an OCH3.

Wait, but each of those carbons (the ones in the double bond) would be connected to:

- a carbonyl group (O=C-OCH3),

- and another substituent.

Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Maybe each of the double bond carbons is connected to two ester groups and a hydrogen.

No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps each of the double bond carbons is connected to one ester group and two Hs. But then, the molecule would have H's on the double bond, which is possible but doesn't create a chiral center.

Wait, but in any case, if the structure doesn't have any chiral centers, then it can't exhibit optical isomerism. So, does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center? I'm not sure.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric, so it can't have optical isomerism. Or perhaps it's a meso compound.

Wait, a meso compound has multiple chiral centers but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.

If dimethyl fumarate has two identical ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. For example, if the two ester groups are on opposite ends and the molecule has a plane of symmetry cutting through the double bond, then the molecule may not be chiral.

But wait, no. Because the two ester groups are on opposite sides, the molecule might not have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think of a simpler example. For example, tartaric acid has two chiral centers and exists as meso and d/l forms.

Wait, but in the case of dimethyl fumarate, the structure is two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule is not symmetrical, so it can have optical isomerism, meaning it can exist as enantiomers.

Wait, but wait a minute. Dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. Maleate is the cis diastereomer, and fumarate is the trans. But that's about E/Z isomerism, not optical isomerism.

Wait, no, E and Z refers to the arrangement around the double bond, which is a different type of isomerism. Optical isomerism arises due to chiral centers, not double bonds.

So, unless the molecule has a chiral center, it won't exhibit optical isomerism. So, does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers?

Looking at each carbon in the molecule: the carbons in the ester groups are connected to OCH3, O, and two other groups. Wait, perhaps the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) are each connected to two ester groups and two Hs. In that case, each would have substituents OCH3, O, and two Hs. But that's only three substituents, so maybe it's not a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each of the double bond carbons is connected to an ester group and three other groups, making them chiral centers.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. If the structure is O=C-OCH3 connected to each side of the double bond, then each of the double bond carbons is connected to:

- a carbonyl group,

- an OCH3,

- and two Hs.

So each has two Hs, a carbonyl, and an OCH3. That would make them have three substituents plus the double bond. But that's not possible because each carbon can only have four bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each of the double bond carbons is connected to a carbonyl group, an OCH3, and two CH2 groups. But that seems unlikely.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think about each of the four compounds and determine if they have any chiral centers.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Looking at this structure, each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. The biphenyl is connected at positions 1 and 1'.

So the molecule is symmetrical. Because each ring has the same substituents, the molecule as a whole might have a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it might not be chiral, so no optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: As discussed earlier, the middle carbon may not have four different substituents, so no optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone: No chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: If the molecule has a chiral center, then yes. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, but if the molecule is symmetric, then it can't have optical isomerism. If it's not symmetric, then it can have optical isomerism.

Wait, another approach: If the molecule can be superimposed on its mirror image, then it's not chiral. If not, then it is.

In the case of dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule isn't symmetric because the arrangement of the substituents is such that rotating it wouldn't make it the same as the mirror image. Therefore, it might have optical isomerism.

Wait, but maybe the molecule is a meso compound. For example, if there are two chiral centers that are mirror images, making the overall molecule achiral.

But in dimethyl fumarate, are there any chiral centers?

Each of the double bond carbons is connected to:

- COOCH3,

- and two CH2 groups.

Wait, no, perhaps each is connected to COOCH3 and two other substituents. Let me think: each double bond carbon is connected to COOCH3, a CH2, and another group.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's consider the structure:

The dimethyl fumarate molecule would have the structure:

O=C-OCH3 - CH2 - CH2 - O=C-OCH3

But that's a single bond, so it's not fumarate. Fumarate must have a double bond between the two carbonyl groups.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Fumarate would have the structure:

O=C-OCH3

|

C=C

|

O=C-OCH3

But that's impossible because the double bond can't be between the two carbonyl carbons. Wait, no, that's incorrect. The correct structure is:

Each of the two middle carbons (connected by a double bond) has a COOCH3 group attached.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3 - C = C - COOCH3

But with the substituents on opposite sides (trans configuration).

Wait, but in that case, each of the middle carbons is connected to:

- COOCH3,

- and three other groups. Let's see:

Each of the middle carbons is connected to:

- COOCH3,

- two Hs,

- and a double bond to the other carbon.

Wait, that's three substituents plus the double bond. So each has four bonds: COOCH3, H, H, and double bond. So each has two Hs, which are the same.

So, each of the middle carbons would have substituents: COOCH3, H, H, and double bond. Therefore, they are each connected to three different groups: COOCH3, H, and the double bond.

Wait, but a double bond is a substituent, so perhaps each middle carbon is connected to COOCH3, two Hs, and the double bond. That would make four substituents, but two of them are the same (the Hs). So, the substituents are: COOCH3, H, H, and C=C.

Wait, but that's four substituents, but two are same, so the carbon isn't a chiral center because it doesn't have four different substituents.

So, in that case, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so it can't exhibit optical isomerism. Therefore, option 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. I thought that fumarate has a trans configuration, but that refers to the double bond, not the presence of chiral centers.

So, perhaps none of the options 1 to 4 have optical isomerism, but that's unlikely because the question says one of the options is correct.

Wait, going back:

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2. So the two rings are mirror images of each other. Therefore, the molecule is symmetrical and probably not chiral. So no optical isomerism.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: no chiral center, as discussed.

Option 3: benzophenone: no chiral centers.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate: no chiral centers.

Hmm, but that would suggest none show optical isomerism, which can't be right because the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again. Could dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center elsewhere?

Wait, perhaps the ester groups are on the same side. No, fumarate is the trans isomer, so they're on opposite sides.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center in the middle. Let me think: if the central part of the molecule is a chiral center.

Wait, no, the central part is a double bond, which doesn't have a chiral center. So maybe the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers.

Wait, so if none of the four options have optical isomerism, but that's not possible because the question gives options where some do.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 1. Let me think again about the biphenyl structure.

The compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate group at position 2. The biphenyl is connected at positions 1 and 1'.

In such a structure, each ring has substituents in positions 2 and 6. So the two rings are mirror images, making the molecule symmetrical. Therefore, it would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is not symmetrical. For example, if the substituents are at positions that don't allow for a plane of symmetry, then the molecule could be chiral.

Let me imagine the biphenyl structure: the two benzene rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, looking at one ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. On the other ring, same.

Because both rings are identical in their substitution pattern, the molecule as a whole would have a center of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, options 1 and 4 would not show optical isomerism, but I'm not sure.

Wait, option 4: dimethyl fumarate. I had earlier thought there are no chiral centers, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again.

If the structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

O=C-OCH3

|

C=C

|

O=C-OCH3

With the substituents (the ester groups) on opposite sides of the double bond, then each of the double bond carbons is connected to:

- COOCH3,

- two Hs,

- and the double bond.

But that's three substituents, which would mean the carbon isn't a chiral center.

Wait, but perhaps the substituents are not just Hs. Maybe each double bond carbon is connected to COOCH3 and two other groups, like CH3 groups.

Wait, no, the structure is:

Each of the double bond carbons is connected to COOCH3, a CH2 group, and another group.

Wait, perhaps each double bond carbon is connected to COOCH3, CH2CH3, and another group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each double bond carbon is connected to COOCH3, and two CH2 groups, making them have four substituents: COOCH3, CH2, CH2, and the double bond.

Wait, but that can't be because a double bond is a substituent. So each double bond carbon would have:

- COOCH3,

- CH2,

- CH2,

- and C=C.

But that would make two CH2 groups, so four substituents, but two are same. So, the substituents are COOCH3, CH2, CH2, and C=C. So, the substituents are not all different, so no chiral center.

Thus, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

Hmm, but then none of the options 1-4 have optical isomerism, which can't be right. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, in option 2, maybe I was wrong about the structure. Let me think again.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Structure: CH3CH(OH)COOCH3?

Wait, maybe I should draw this. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no. Propanoate is three carbons. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate is HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

Wait, the central carbon in this case is the CH2 connected to the OH.

So the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the CH2 with OH) is connected to:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (left and right),

- and a COOCH3 group.

Wait, but this would give the central carbon four substituents: OH, CH2COOCH3, CH2H, and H. Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, the central carbon is CH2, which has two CH2 groups attached, so it has:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- CH2H,

- and another H.

Wait, that can't be because each carbon can only have four bonds. So perhaps the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

The middle carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two CH2 groups.

Wait, no, that's not possible. The middle carbon is the first CH2 after the OH.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The central carbon is CHOH, connected to:

- two CH2 groups,

- COOCH3,

- and OH.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)CHOHCOOCH3, but that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should think of the molecule as having a chiral center.

If the central carbon (with the OH) is connected to four different groups, then it's a chiral center. So, what are those groups?

Looking at the groups attached to the central carbon:

1. OH.

2. A CH2 group connected to COOCH3.

3. A CH2 group connected to the other side.

4. Two H's?

Wait, no, the central carbon would have:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- CH2- (from the other side),

- and a hydrogen.

So, substituents are:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- CH2-,

- H.

Wait, the CH2- substituent is just a CH2 connected to another CH2, but perhaps that's the same as the CH2COOCH3 group.

Wait, no, I think I'm confusing the structure here. Let me think of the molecule as:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

The two CH2 groups are in a row. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- CH2- (which is connected to another CH2 group),

- and a hydrogen.

Wait, but that's three substituents plus a hydrogen. So substituents are OH, CH2COOCH3, CH2-, and H. Are any of these the same?

The CH2- substituent is connected to another CH2, which in turn is connected to the COOCH3. So perhaps the substituents are:

1. OH,

2. CH2COOCH3,

3. CH2CH2,

4. H.

Wait, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- CH2- (connected to another CH2),

- and a hydrogen.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- CH2- (connected to another group),

- and a CH3.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should just accept that option 2 doesn't have a chiral center and thus no optical isomerism. But then, none of the options would have optical isomerism, which can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again.

If dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center, then it would show optical isomerism. So, perhaps each of the double bond carbons is connected to three different groups and a double bond, making each a chiral center.

Wait, but a double bond is not a substituent in that sense. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate is such that each of the carbons in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3, a CH2 group, and a hydrogen. So, each would have:

- COOCH3,

- CH2,

- H,

- and the double bond.

But that would make each of these carbons have three substituents plus the double bond, totaling four bonds. So, each has three substituent groups plus the double bond. So, each substituent is different: COOCH3, CH2, H.

Therefore, each of these carbons would have four different substituents, making them chiral centers.

Wait, but that would mean that dimethyl fumarate has two chiral centers. So, it would have stereoisomers, but would that include optical isomers?

Yes, because if the molecule has at least one chiral center, it can exhibit optical isomerism. So, if dimethyl fumarate has two chiral centers, it can have enantiomers, diastereomers, etc.

But wait, if the two chiral centers are on each end of the double bond, and the molecule is symmetric, then it might be a meso compound, meaning it's achiral despite having chiral centers.

So, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, if the two chiral centers are mirror images of each other, then the molecule could be meso, making it achiral.

But, if the substituents are arranged such that there's no plane of symmetry, then the molecule would be chiral and exhibit optical isomerism.

So, in the structure of dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are trans (opposite sides). So, the two chiral centers would have opposite configurations, leading to a meso compound. Therefore, it would not have optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about tartaric acid as an example. The meso form has two chiral centers with opposite configurations, making it achiral.

So, if dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, then it wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism. But earlier, I thought that fumarate is the trans isomer, which would be the meso form.

So, in that case, dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound and doesn't have optical isomerism.

Hmm, this is getting really complicated. I think I need to recap.

The question is about which of the four compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism requires the presence of at least one chiral center, and the molecule must not have a plane of symmetry.

Reviewing each option:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: Symmetrical, no chiral centers. No optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: No chiral center. No optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone: No chiral centers. No optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: If it's a meso compound, then no optical isomerism. If it's not meso, then yes.

But I'm not certain about option 4. Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does not have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but if option 4 is not exhibiting optical isomerism, then the correct answer would exclude it, but according to the options, option A includes 1,2,4. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 1. Let me think again about the biphenyl compound.

Each benzene ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. So, the two rings are mirror images. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So no optical isomerism.

So, which of the four options have optical isomerism?

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. If it has two chiral centers but is a meso compound, then no. If it's not meso, then yes.

Wait, but wait. The structure of fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule is symmetrical along the double bond, making it a meso compound, thus achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, none of the options 1-4 have optical isomerism, which can't be right because the options don't include that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with option 2. Let me think again.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

If the molecule is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- OH,

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- and CH2 group.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.

The structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

The middle carbon is the CH2 with OH.

Wait, the substituents on the middle carbon are:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- CH2- (which is connected to another CH2),

- and a hydrogen.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- CH2- (which is connected to another group),

- and a hydrogen.

But that would make four substituents, but two are the same (CH2 groups), so no chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

The central carbon (CH2OH) is connected to:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- CH2-,

- and a hydrogen.

Wait, that would make four substituents, but two are the same (CH2 groups), so no chiral center.

Hmm, but perhaps I'm making a mistake in the structure. Let me think again. Maybe the structure is (CH3)CHOHCOOCH3, which would be 2-hydroxypropanoate.

In that case, the structure would be:

CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- OH,

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group.

Wait, no, that's not possible. Alternatively, the structure is:

CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

So the carbon with OH is connected to:

- OH,

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- and a CH2 group.

Wait, but that's not possible because that would imply four substituents, which it can't have. Hmm, I'm getting stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon is connected to four different groups, making it a chiral center.

If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- OH,

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon is connected to:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- CH2-,

- and a hydrogen.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let me think of the molecule as having a chiral center. If that's the case, then option 2 would exhibit optical isomerism.

But earlier reasoning suggests that option 2 doesn't have a chiral center. So I'm stuck.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should look for the correct answer based on the options provided.

The options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3 and4

C)2 and3

D)1 and2

From my analysis, option 4 (dimethyl fumarate) may or may not have optical isomerism. But based on previous reasoning, it's a meso compound and thus doesn't have optical isomerism. So options 1,2,4 don't have optical isomerism, which would leave option 4 as not being in any correct combination.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about option 4. Let me think again.

If fumarate is a trans diastereomer, then dimethyl fumarate would have the two ester groups on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetrical, thus a meso compound. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, options 1,2,3,4 all don't have optical isomerism, which isn't an option given.

But the options include option A: 1,2,4. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps option 4 does have optical isomerism. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, looking back at the options, perhaps none of the four compounds exhibit optical isomerism, but that's not one of the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think about atropisomerism for option 1. Atropisomerism occurs when the rotation around a single bond is hindered, leading to different conformations that are non-superimposable.

In option 1, the biphenyl has substituents at positions that hinder rotation. If the substituents are large enough, the molecule can have atropisomers, which exhibit different physical properties, including optical activity.

So, for option 1, if the substituents are at positions that prevent free rotation, the molecule can have atropisomers, which would exhibit optical isomerism.

In the case of 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate, the substituents at 6 and 2 positions on each ring may be large enough (nitro and ester groups) to cause significant hindrance to rotation around the central bond. Therefore, the molecule could have atropisomers, which are optical isomers.

So, option 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

If that's correct, then which options have optical isomerism?

Option 1: yes.

Option 2: no.

Option 3: no.

Option4: no.

So, only option 1 has optical isomerism. But looking at the options, option D is 1 and 2.

So if only option 1, then none of the options match. But perhaps I'm wrong about option 2.

Alternatively, perhaps option 2 does have a chiral center. Let me think again.

If the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, then the central carbon (CH2OH) is connected to:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- CH2- (which is connected to another CH2 group),

- and a hydrogen.

Wait, if the substituents are:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- CH2-CH2,

- and H.

Then, the substituents are different. So the central carbon would have four different substituents, making it a chiral center. Therefore, option 2 would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, if both option 1 and 2 have optical isomerism, then the correct option would be D) 1 and 2.

But earlier analysis suggested that option 1 has atropisomerism, and option 2 has a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

So the correct answer would be option D) 1 and 2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each option based on the presence of chiral centers or atropisomerism:

### Option 1: Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate  
This compound is a biphenyl derivative with nitro groups at positions 6 and carboxylate esters at positions 2 on each benzene ring. The molecule is symmetric due to identical substituents on both rings, and free rotation around the central bond is possible unless hindered. However, the large nitro and ester groups at positions 6 and 2 create significant steric hindrance, preventing free rotation. This results in atropisomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images, leading to optical isomerism.

### Option 2: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  
The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (OH) is connected to four different substituents:  
- OH,  
- CH3,  
- COOCH3,  
- and a hydrogen.  

This satisfies the criteria for a chiral center, meaning the molecule can exist as enantiomers and exhibit optical isomerism.

### Option 3: Benzophenone  
Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)2CO, where two benzene rings are connected to a ketone group. The molecule lacks any chiral centers or hindered rotation around bonds, and it is planar. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Option 4: Dimethyl Fumarate  
Dimethyl fumarate is the trans (E) diester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. The two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Each carbon in the double bond is connected to:  
- COOCH3,  
- CH2,  
- H,  
- and the double bond.  

While the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it does not have any chiral centers. The E/Z isomerism around the double bond is geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism. Additionally, the molecule is a meso compound due to symmetry, making it achiral and unable to exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion  
- **Option 1**: Exhibits optical isomerism due to atropisomerism.  
- **Option 2**: Exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center.  
- **Option 3**: Does not exhibit optical isomerism.  
- **Option 4**: Does not exhibit optical isomerism.  

The correct answer is **D) 1 and 2**, as these two compounds exhibit optical isomerism.  

Answer: D
