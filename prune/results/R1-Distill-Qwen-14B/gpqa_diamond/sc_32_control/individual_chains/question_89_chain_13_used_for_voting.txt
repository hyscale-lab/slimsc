Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C, producing a light yellow solid product 1. The ¹H NMR spectrum of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H), and there's an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. 

Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question asks about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's ¹H NMR, excluding those that exchange with the solvent.

Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination or substitution. The IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group, like an ester or ketone. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a bicyclic compound with two bromine atoms opposite each other. When treated with a strong base like KOH, maybe it undergoes dehydrohalogenation. But wait, it's dibrominated, so perhaps two eliminations happen.

Wait, another possibility is that each Br is replaced by an -OH, but that would give diol. However, the IR peak suggests a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates and the Br leaves, but that might form a double bond.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two adjacent Br atoms on the adamantane structure. So, when KOH is used, perhaps it's a double elimination, leading to a diene. But wait, that might not form a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the KOH causes a ring-opening? Hmm.

Alternatively, considering that KOH is a strong base, perhaps it abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr twice. So, each Br is removed, and double bonds are formed. But if two eliminations happen, maybe the structure becomes more unsaturated.

Wait, but the IR has 1720 cm⁻¹ which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe each Br is replaced by an -O⁻, but that doesn't fit with the IR. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an oxygen group, like an epoxide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) with strong bases like KOH can lead to elimination, forming an alkene. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide; the bromines are across from each other on the adamantane structure. So maybe each Br is replaced by an -OH group, but that would form a diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, wait, KOH in high temperatures and dibromides... Maybe it's a Williamson-type ether synthesis, but that's usually for less hindered systems. Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a ring-opening, leading to a ketone. Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. Each carbon in adamantane is part of multiple rings. The dihalide is 1,3-dibromoadamantane; so the two Br atoms are on opposite positions.

So, when KOH is heated with it, maybe each Br is replaced by an O⁻, which upon protonation gives an alcohol. But that would be a diol, but that doesn't give a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the base causes elimination of HBr twice, leading to a conjugated diene. But then, how does that produce a carbonyl?

Wait, wait. Another possibility: the base could cause a neighboring group participation. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by an -O- group, forming a cyclic ether? But again, I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think about the product's NMR. The ¹H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a region where CH₂ groups attached to electronegative atoms like O appear. The 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) is probably the adamantane skeleton, maybe as CH₂ groups. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another CH₂ group, perhaps next to an oxygen or in a different environment.

The IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carbonyl. So perhaps product 1 is an ester or a ketone. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines. If KOH is a strong base, perhaps it abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr, forming a double bond. But wait, if two eliminations happen, maybe we get a conjugated diene. But that wouldn't lead to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is part of a substitution reaction. Wait, KOH in high temperatures could be a nucleophilic substitution. Maybe each Br is replaced by an -OH group, making a diol. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that's conflicting.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a Fittig reaction, but that involves coupling two aryl halides, which doesn't fit here.

Alternatively, perhaps the two Br atoms are replaced by an ethylene group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. The IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product is a ketone. How can that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Wait, perhaps the base induces elimination of HBr twice, but how would that form a ketone?

Alternatively, maybe a di-elimination forms a carbonyl. Wait, I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, wait. Let's think about ozonolysis later, but perhaps that's more involved. Let's first try to figure out product 1.

Another possibility: 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, undergoes two dehydrohalogenation reactions, each eliminating HBr. If the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to each Br, then each Br leaves, and double bonds form. But since the Brs are on 1 and 3 positions, perhaps the elimination leads to a conjugated diene somewhere in the adamantane structure.

Wait, but how would that lead to a carbonyl group? Unless during elimination, a ring opens, leading to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but that's more about amines, so probably not.

Wait, another possibility: when KOH is heated with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, it could form a cyclic ether via the elimination of HBr. But that would require the two Brs to be adjacent, which they're not. So that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an O⁻, which then might form an epoxide. But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. How? Maybe the elimination leads to two carbonyl groups, but I'm not sure how the structure would arrange that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more straightforward. 1,3-Dibromoadamantane is a dihalide, and when treated with KOH, it undergoes dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. Wait, but it's 1,3, so the two Brs are across from each other. So elimination would form two double bonds? That doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps each Br is removed, and each position becomes a double bond, but that would require the structure to have each Br on adjacent carbons, which it's not.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about possible products.

Product 1 has an IR at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product is an ketone. So perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to a ketone?

Wait, no, dehydrohalogenation using a base typically forms alkenes, not ketones. But perhaps in this case, the structure allows for a carbonyl to form.

Wait, maybe the base abstracts a proton adjacent to a Br, leading to a double bond. But how does that form a carbonyl? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a rearrangement. For example, a pinacol-like rearrangement, but that's for vicinal diols. I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: adamantane is a highly strained structure, so perhaps the reaction breaks a ring, leading to a structure with a carbonyl. For example, if a bridge is broken, leading to a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms an epoxide, but then why the IR has a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I should look for the NMR data. The NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a CH₂ group. That's downfield, so it's probably attached to an oxygen. Maybe it's an ether, but the IR is 1720, which is more like a ketone or ester.

Wait, 4.79 ppm is also around where an -O-CH₂-O- group might appear, like in a cyclic ether, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, the 4.79 ppm could be a CH₂ attached to an electronegative atom like O, perhaps as an alcohol. But if it's an alcohol, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So maybe it's an ester or a ketone.

Wait, another approach: maybe product 1 is a diepoxide. But then the IR would show an epoxide C-O-C peak around 1200 cm⁻¹, which isn't mentioned.

Wait, perhaps the product is a gem-diol, but that would be more in the case of a dihalide with adjacent Brs. Since the Brs are 1,3, that's not adjacent.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. How? If each Br is replaced by a ketone group, but that would require two carbonyls, which would be very unusual. The IR would have a peak around 1700 cm⁻¹, which fits.

But how would the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane lead to a diketone? Maybe via some kind of elimination and rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring, but that doesn't fit with the starting material.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane. No, that doesn't fit the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ether, like an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the reaction conditions. KOH is a strong base, and heating it with a dihalide could lead to a double elimination, forming an alkene. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the structure of adamantane. It's a four-fused cyclohexane ring structure. So each bridge has two CH₂ groups. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on opposite bridgeheads.

Heating with KOH could lead to elimination, but in a way that forms a double bond between two bridgeheads. Wait, but bridgehead double bonds are not allowed due to Bredt's rule. So that's impossible. Therefore, the elimination must form a double bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a pair of double bonds in the structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't eliminate HBr but instead substitutes Br with something else. For example, in a nucleophilic substitution, each Br could be replaced by an -O- group from KOH. So product 1 would be a diether. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Wait, but the IR peak is at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe each Br is replaced by an -O- group, and the structure undergoes some kind of ring-opening to form a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide reacts with two equivalents of KOH, leading to a diol. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the dihalide undergoes a double elimination to form a conjugated diene. But where would the carbonyl come from?

Alternatively, maybe the base induces a ring contraction, leading to a smaller ring with a carbonyl. For example, a bridge is contracted, and a ketone is formed. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester. How would that form? Maybe the dihalide reacts with an alcohol, but the reaction uses KOH, which wouldn't provide an alcohol. Alternatively, maybe it's a self-esterification, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction forms a ketone via a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but I don't see an oxidizing agent here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the IR. 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong, maybe ester or ketone. Let's say it's a ketone. So product 1 is an adamantane-based ketone.

But how does that happen from a dihalide and KOH?

Wait, perhaps each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group. But that would require each Br to be substituted with a carbonyl, which would mean two ketones. But that structure might not be possible.

Alternatively, maybe the heating with KOH causes the two Brs to leave, and the structure rearranges to form a ketone.

Wait, maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation forming a double bond, which then undergoes some kind of electrocyclic reaction to form a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base causes the formation of a diradical, leading to a new structure with a carbonyl. But I'm not familiar with such a mechanism.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's take a step back.

Product 1 has an IR at 1720, which is a carbonyl. The NMR has a 2H at 4.79, which is probably a CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Also, the other signals are likely from the adamantane skeleton.

So, perhaps product 1 is a diester. But where would the ester groups come from? Unless the dihalide reacts with two equivalents of something. But with KOH, which is a base, perhaps it's more likely to form an ether or an alcohol.

Wait, another idea: maybe the dihalide reacts with KOH in a nucleophilic substitution to form a diol, but then undergoes some kind of oxidation. But in the first step, KOH is the only reagent. So oxidation would require another agent, which isn't present.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclic ketone. For example, the dihalide loses two HBr molecules, and the carbons where the Brs were attached form double bonds, but that leads to strained structure, which might not be favorable.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a conjugated diene, but again, how does that form a carbonyl?

Hmm, maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the next reaction.

Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2.

Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)₃) is a Lewis acid catalyst often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But for Friedel-Crafts, the substrate should be an aromatic ring, which adamantane isn't. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an acylation product.

Wait, product 1 is a ketone. So, if product 1 is a ketone, heating it with Al(OiPr)3 might lead to some kind of acylation or alkylation. But without an aromatic ring, Friedel-Crafts isn't applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol. But earlier analysis says IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ether with a ketone. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. But again, the IR would show a different peak.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. For example, if each Br in 1,3-dibromoadamantane is replaced by a carbonyl group. So, the product would be 1,3-adamantanedione. Then, the NMR would show two ketone groups, but the ¹H NMR given only has one peak at 4.79 ppm, which is a CH₂.

Wait, but 1,3-adamantanedione would have two carbonyl groups, and perhaps some methyl groups. But the NMR shows a 2H at 4.79, which doesn't fit a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester. For example, if each Br is replaced by an ester group. But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of product 1 as a ketone. Let's say it's 1-adamantane-3-one, but I'm not sure.

Moving on to product 2: product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it undergoes some kind of alkylation or acylation. But without an aromatic ring, Friedel-Crafts isn't applicable.

Wait, perhaps product 1 isn't a ketone but an epoxide. Then, heating with Al(OiPr)3 might catalyze ring-opening. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, and the Al(OiPr)3 acts as a Lewis acid to facilitate some reaction.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an acetal or ketal, but that would require a diol.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is a cyclic acetal formed by Al(OiPr)3. But again, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, and product 2 undergoes some kind of elimination. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the third step. Product 2 is subjected to ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond.

So, product 2 has a double bond, which is cleaved in the presence of ozone. Ozonolysis typically breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

Now, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3’s NMR.

But to get there, I need to figure out what product 3 is, which depends on product 2, which depends on product 1.

So, let's try to reconstruct the possible structure.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1.

Assuming that product 1 is a diol, perhaps 1,3-adamantane diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl, which it does. So that's conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone. How?

Wait, maybe the dihalide undergoes elimination to form a carbonyl group. Wait, elimination forming a carbonyl group would require the departure of both Brs as HBr, but I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, maybe it's a case of oxidative elimination. For example, in some coupling reactions, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide reacts with two equivalents of KOH, leading to substitution, but that would form a diol, which doesn't explain the IR.

Wait, another thought: maybe the dihalide is dehydrohalogenated twice to form a conjugated diene, and under certain conditions, this diene could undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition or some other reaction to form a carbonyl. But that seems like a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene undergoes electrocyclic ring-opening to form a carbonyl. But without more information, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the product 1 is a gem-dihalide elimination, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the NMR data again. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is probably a CH₂ group. Since the IR has a carbonyl, perhaps it's an acetal group. But then, how would that form from a dihalide and KOH?

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is an ester. For example, if each Br is replaced by an ester group. But how would that happen? Maybe KOH is not providing the ester groups, so perhaps the dihalide reacts with an alcohol, but in this case, KOH is the reagent, which might not provide the necessary alcohol.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Grignard reagent, but KOH isn't a Grignard reagent.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone because of a double elimination. Let me imagine that.

1,3-dibromoadamantane → upon heating with KOH, two dehydrohalogenation steps occur, each eliminating HBr. So each Br is removed, and double bonds form. But since the Brs are on positions 1 and 3, elimination would form two adjacent double bonds, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the structure rearranges to form a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the elimination forms a conjugated diene, and then some cyclization or rearrangement forms a ketone. For example, a [3,3] sigmatropic shift, like a Cope rearrangement, but that typically requires heat and specific structures.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene undergoes electrocyclic ring-opening to form a carbonyl.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for similar problems or mechanisms.

Wait, another angle: the IR at 1720 is a strong carbonyl, so product 1 is likely an ester or a ketone. The NMR has a 2H at 4.79, which could be a CH₂ attached to an oxygen, like in an ester group.

So, if product 1 is a diester, perhaps each Br is replaced by an ester group. But how would that happen? Each Br would have to undergo substitution with an ester group.

But since KOH is a base, perhaps the dihalide is treated with an alcohol, but KOH is not an alcohol. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide reacts with an alkoxide, but KOH is a strong base and would provide OH⁻.

Wait, perhaps the dihalide reacts with two equivalents of KOH to form a diol, but that doesn't lead to a carbonyl. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps instead of substitution, elimination occurs. Each Br is removed, and the structure forms a double bond. But then how does a carbonyl form?

Wait, maybe the elimination forms a ketone via some kind of ring contraction. For example, if the adamantane structure loses two bridges, leading to a smaller ring with a ketone.

But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclohexenone derivative. But the adamantane structure makes that unclear.

Hmm, maybe I should make an assumption to proceed. Let's assume product 1 is an ester, specifically a mono-ester, but then what would the NMR look like?

Wait, the NMR has 2H at 4.79, which could be a CH₂ connected to an oxygen, like an ester. The 10H between 2.41-2.23 could be the adamantane's CH₂ groups, and the 2H at 1.94 might be another CH₂ attached to the ester or in a different environment.

Wait, but for an ester, the carbonyl is usually around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹, which matches the IR. So product 1 is probably a mono-ester.

But how? The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Perhaps each Br is replaced by an ester group, but that would require two ester groups, leading to a diester. But the NMR only shows one set of 2H, which might correspond to one ester group.

Alternatively, perhaps only one Br is replaced by an ester group, but that would require only one equivalent of reagent, which isn't the case here (excess KOH is used).

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group, and then one of the OH groups is esterified. But again, the reaction conditions don't suggest that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible structure of product 1. If product 1 is a mono-ester, then perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution of one Br with an alcoholate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the mechanism. KOH is a strong base, so perhaps it abstracts a β-hydrogen leading to elimination. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes two eliminations, losing two HBr molecules, forming a diene. But then, how does that lead to a carbonyl group?

Alternatively, perhaps the diene undergoes a reaction to form a carbonyl. For instance, ozonolysis would break the diene into two carbonyls, but that's in the third step, so that's not product 1.

Wait, perhaps the diene is formed in product 1, which then in product 2 is further reacted.

Wait, product 1 is a diene, product 2 is something else. Then, product 2 is ozonized, leading to product 3.

Wait, let's try this scenario. Product 1 is a diene. Then, product 2 is a diene treated with Al(OiPr)3. But I'm not sure what reaction that would be.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, product 2 is a diol treated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps forming some kind of acetal.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should consider that product 1 is a ketone. Let's say product 1 is 1-adamantane-3-one. Then, the NMR would have the 2H as part of the ketone environment.

Wait, but 1-adamantane-3-one would have a carbonyl group, which fits the IR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH₂ near the carbonyl, perhaps in a bridge position. The other signals are from the adamantane structure.

If product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 is formed by heating with Al(OiPr)3. Perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or some kind of acetal, but without a diol, that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an alkylated ketone, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Moving on, product 2 is ozonized. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyl groups.

So, if product 2 has a double bond, then product 3 would have two carbonyl groups where the double bond was. The coupling pattern in the NMR of product 3 would depend on the structure of these carbonyl groups and the adjacent hydrogens.

But what's the most deshielded hydrogen? It would likely be adjacent to an electronegative group, like a carbonyl.

Now, considering that, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is part of an aldehyde group. Aldehydic protons are typically deshielded and appear around 9-10 ppm. But the options don't mention that, and the question says to exclude those that exchange with deuterated solvent, which would include aldehydic protons if they're present.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a ketone or another group. Alternatively, maybe it's a methine group adjacent to carbonyls.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis breaks a cyclopropane ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the ozonolysis step. If product 2 is a diene, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. The resulting product would have two carbonyls. The NMR would then show peaks corresponding to the carbons next to these groups.

If the most deshielded hydrogen is next to a carbonyl, it would couple with neighboring hydrogens. For example, if it's a CH₂ next to a carbonyl, it would couple with the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet if each has two adjacent hydrogens.

Alternatively, if it's a CH group next to a carbonyl, it might couple with two different sets of hydrogens, leading to a more complex splitting pattern.

But in the options, the possible answers are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is a CH group that's adjacent to two different sets of CH₂ groups. For example, if the structure is something like R-CO-CH₂-CH₂-CO-R', then the CH₂ groups would couple with each other. But in that case, the splitting might be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that the deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group next to another CH₂ group, and each of those is next to another CH₂, the splitting could be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, another possibility: the deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH group that is adjacent to two different CH₂ groups. Each CH₂ group would split the signal into a doublet, and if each of those is further split, it could lead to a more complex pattern like a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Let me try to reconstruct the entire process.

1,3-dibromoadamantane → heated with KOH → product 1 (maybe a diol, but IR suggests carbonyl, so perhaps a ketone).

Product 1 is heated with Al(OiPr)3 → product 2 (maybe a diene?).

Product 2 is ozonized → product 3. Ozonolysis breaks double bonds into carbonyls.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were. The NMR of product 3 would show signals from the hydrogens adjacent to these carbonyls.

Assuming that product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have two carbonyl groups connected by some structure.

But the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be next to a carbonyl, perhaps in a CH₂ group. If that CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂ group, each H would couple with two neighbors, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH₂ is next to two different sets of CH₂ groups, the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is a diketone, leading to adjacent CH₂ groups next to each ketone. So, the CH₂ groups next to the ketones would have coupling with each other, leading to a triplet.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl and two different CH₂ groups. This would lead to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, another approach: In ozonolysis, if the double bond is between two CH₂ groups, ozonolysis would cleave it, leading to two carbonyl groups. So, for example, if the diene is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂, ozonolysis would give two aldehydes or ketones depending on substitution.

But in our case, the starting material is adamantane, so the diene would be part of a ring structure.

Wait, perhaps product 2 has a cyclopropane ring, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is part of a bridged structure, and ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, each adjacent to a CH₂ group.

In that case, each CH₂ adjacent to a carbonyl would have neighboring CH₂ groups, leading to a coupling pattern of a triplet.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, maybe the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH group that is adjacent to two different CH₂ groups. Each of these CH₂ groups would split the peak into a doublet, and if each of those is further split, it could become a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets.

Hmm.

Another possibility is that the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH group that is next to two different CH groups, each with their own coupling, leading to a more complex splitting pattern.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging to determine the coupling pattern.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

A pentet (five peaks) would imply four neighboring hydrogens, which is less likely unless the hydrogen is adjacent to a CH₂-CH₂ group or similar.

A triplet of triplets would arise if the hydrogen is split by two different sets of two neighboring hydrogens, each with J1 and J2 coupling constants.

A doublet of triplets would be split by two different coupling partners, one with a doublet and the other with a triplet.

A triplet is the simplest, arising from two neighboring hydrogens.

Given the options, I'm leaning towards a triplet of triplets or a triplet.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH group that's adjacent to two different CH₂ groups, each with two hydrogens. So each coupling would be a doublet, but if each of those is split again, it could lead to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis leads to a diketone, and the adjacent CH₂ groups each have two neighboring hydrogens, leading to a triplet.

Wait, perhaps I should visualize the structure.

Assuming product 2 has a conjugated diene, say, in a bridge of adamantane. Ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyl groups. So, each bridge would have a carbonyl group, and the adjacent carbons would be CH₂ groups.

Each of these CH₂ groups would be adjacent to another CH₂ group, leading to coupling. Each H in the CH₂ would see two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

So, in the NMR, each CH₂ would be a triplet.

But wait, the question asks for the most deshielded hydrogen. The CH₂ groups adjacent to carbonyls would be deshielded, but perhaps the most deshielded is a CH group, like in a ketone's alpha position.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded is a CH group that's part of a carbonyl group's adjacent structure.

Wait, but in any case, the coupling pattern of a CH₂ group adjacent to another CH₂ group would be a triplet.

But the options don't have a triplet as the correct answer? Wait, option A is triplet.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH group that's adjacent to two different CH₂ groups, each with two hydrogens, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH group that's adjacent to two different CH₂ groups. Each coupling would split the signal. For example, if a CH is next to a CH₂ (which has two Hs) and another CH₂ (which also has two Hs), the coupling would be J1 and J2. So each H would split into a doublet, and then each of those would split again, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the coupling constants are similar, it might just appear as a triplet.

But in this case, perhaps the coupling is to two different sets of Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, another angle: in the ozonolysis product, if the structure is something like O=C-R-CH₂-CH₂-CO=O, then the CH₂ groups next to the carbonyls would each have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

But in that case, the most deshielded H would be on the CH₂ groups next to the carbonyl, showing as a triplet.

But perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH group that is adjacent to two different CH₂ groups, each giving a doublet, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a pentet if there are four neighboring Hs. But I don't see how that would happen.

I think I'm getting stuck here, but I have to make a choice.

Considering all the steps, product 3 is likely to have hydrogens adjacent to carbonyl groups. These hydrogens would be deshielded. If each of these hydrogens is adjacent to two other hydrogens (like in a CH₂ group next to another CH₂ group), the coupling would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if the hydrogen is adjacent to two different CH₂ groups, each with two Hs, it would split into a triplet of triplets.

But given the options, I'm more inclined to think it's a triplet of triplets, making the answer option B.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The key steps and reasoning are as follows:

1. **Reaction with KOH**: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH produces product 1. The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a structure where a CH₂ group is attached to an electronegative atom (likely oxygen), and the remaining signals correspond to the adamantane skeleton. Based on the IR and NMR data, product 1 is likely a ketone, as the carbonyl group fits the 1720 cm⁻¹ IR peak and the 4.79 ppm CH₂ group.

2. **Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**: Heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide forms product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid commonly used in Friedel-Crafts reactions, but since adamantane lacks aromaticity, this step likely facilitates the formation of a diene or a related structure with a double bond. This sets up product 2 for the subsequent ozonolysis step.

3. **Ozonolysis**: Ozonolysis of product 2 cleaves the double bond, forming product 3. Ozonolysis typically converts double bonds into carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group, as carbonyls deshield nearby hydrogens. The coupling pattern of this hydrogen depends on its neighboring groups.

4. **Coupling Pattern Analysis**: The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group. If this hydrogen is part of a CH group next to two different CH₂ groups, it would couple with the hydrogens in both CH₂ groups. Each CH₂ group would split the signal into a doublet, and the combination of these couplings would result in a triplet of triplets. This matches the description of the splitting pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen.

Given the analysis, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet of triplets**.
