Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it out.

The question involves two reactions, and I need to choose the right reagents from the options provided. Let's break down each part.

First Reaction:
The starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. The reagents used are NaCN and A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, so I need to figure out what reagent A does here.

Butanone reacting with NaCN. Wait, I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. When a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, it typically forms a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrins are compounds where a hydroxyl group and a cyanide group are added to the carbonyl carbon.

So, the mechanism would be: the ketone (butan-2-one) reacts with NaCN. The CN- acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon. Then, I think water or another proton source is needed to protonate and form the hydroxyl group and the nitrile.

Wait, but in the first reaction, the reagents are NaCN and reagent A. So maybe A is providing the acid or base conditions needed for the reaction. Let me think: NaCN is a source of CN- ions. But in what conditions does this reaction proceed? I think it's usually done under acidic conditions. Because after the CN- attacks, the oxygen becomes negatively charged and needs to pick up a proton. So maybe A is an acid, like H3O+ (which is H+ from water, but in solution as H3O+).

So for the first reaction, Reagent A is H3O+ (or something acidic). So looking at the options, options A and B have H3O+ for A. Options C and D have NaHSO3 for A.

Second Reaction:
The product from the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (or similarly, the second starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile). It reacts with reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being oxidized to a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

Wait, how does a nitrile become a carboxylic acid? I remember that nitriles can be oxidized. The typical oxidizing agents for this are strong oxidizing conditions. For example, using KMnO4 under acidic conditions, or other oxidizing agents like HClO4 or such.

But the reagent B is given, and it's used with H2O. So what reagent would facilitate the oxidation of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid?

I think that in acidic conditions, KMnO4 is a strong oxidizing agent. Alternatively, HClO4 could be used. But wait, the options don't include KMnO4, so I have to see what's given.

Looking at the options, the possible reagents for B are HCl, CH3COOH, HCl, etc. Wait, none of the options list KMnO4. Hmm. Maybe the reaction is not KMnO4 but another method. Alternatively, maybe the oxidation is done using a mixture of HCl and H2O under heat. Or perhaps using a different acid catalyst.

Wait, another thought: the nitrile group can be hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid under strong acidic or basic conditions. For acidic hydrolysis, you typically use HCl and heat. The nitrile would first hydrolyze to an amide, then further to a carboxylic acid.

So, for the second reaction, reagent B is HCl. Because HCl in H2O (acidic conditions) would hydrolyze the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. So B should be HCl.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A has B as HCl, while option C has B as HCl as well? Let me check the options again.

Wait the options are:

Options:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So, if in the second reaction, B is HCl (as I thought), then for the second reaction, the correct B is HCl, which is present in options A and C.

So the first reaction's reagent A needs to be H3O+ (as I thought earlier), because the first step is the formation of a cyanohydrin, which typically occurs under acidic conditions.

So putting it together: Reagent A is H3O+ (so options A or B), and Reagent B is HCl (so options A or C).

So which of these is correct?

Wait, the first reaction: butan-2-one plus NaCN plus reagent A gives the cyanohydrin. So under what conditions does that happen?

Wait, another thought: sometimes, the addition of NaCN to ketones can be done under neutral or acidic conditions. The cyanohydrin formation usually requires an acid catalyst, so H+ would be needed. So reagent A is H3O+.

So for the first part, A is H3O+ (so options A and B). Then, for the second part, B is HCl (so option A: B is HCl; option C: B is HCl, but A is NaHSO3).

So the correct pair would be A = H3O+ and B = HCl, which is option A.

Wait, but wait another point. The second reaction is the oxidation (or hydrolysis) of nitrile to carboxylic acid. I thought that it requires strong acidic conditions, like HCl. So HCl (B) is correct.

So the correct options would be A: A is H3O+, B is HCl.

So looking at the options, option A is A = H3O+, B = HCl.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reagent is B (H2O). Hmm, perhaps I mixed up the reagents.

Wait, the question says: the second reaction uses reagent B and H2O. So the reagents are B (the answer option) and H2O.

Wait, perhaps I confused the steps. Let me recheck.

In the second reaction, it's reagent B (as per the problem statement) and H2O that are used. So the reagent B is added along with water.

So perhaps the second step is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. Nitriles hydrolyze in acidic conditions to carboxylic acids. So HCl would be the acid here.

Alternatively, maybe it's H2O with HCl as the acid.

So, for the hydrolysis of nitrile to acid, we'd need H2O and an acid. So in the second reaction, reagent B is HCl, which is used in H2O.

So for the second reaction, reagent B is HCl (as in option A and C).

So the first reaction uses H3O+ (so A is H3O+, so options A and B), and the second uses HCl (so B is HCl, so option A and C).

So the only option that fits both is option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but in the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl.

So the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but wait another thought: what if the first reaction doesn't require H3O+? Let me think about the reaction again.

Butan-2-one plus NaCN. I thought it's a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism is that the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, then the oxygen becomes O- which needs to pick up a proton to form the hydroxyl group. So the solution needs to be acidic for the protonation. So the reagent A is H3O+, which provides H+.

So that's correct.

So the correct reagents are A=H3O+ and B=HCl. So option A is correct.

The problem involves two reactions, and the goal is to identify the correct reagents (A and B) from the given options.

### First Reaction:
The starting material is **butan-2-one** (CH₃COCH₃), which reacts with **NaCN** and reagent **A** to form **2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone, forming a cyanohydrin. For this reaction to proceed, acidic conditions are typically required to protonate the oxygen after the nucleophilic attack. Therefore, reagent **A** must be an acid, specifically **H₃O⁺**.

### Second Reaction:
The product from the first reaction, **2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**, reacts with reagent **B** and water (H₂O) to form **2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanoic acid**. This is a hydrolysis reaction where the nitrile group (-CN) is converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid typically occurs under acidic conditions, such as those provided by **HCl**. Therefore, reagent **B** must be **HCl**.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  This matches the requirements for both reactions. H₃O⁺ provides the acidic conditions for the first reaction, and HCl provides the acidic conditions for the second reaction.  
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  While A is correct (H₃O⁺), B (CH₃COOH) is not suitable for the second reaction, as it does not provide the strong acidic conditions needed for nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.  
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  A (NaHSO₃) is not suitable for the first reaction, as it does not provide the acidic conditions required for cyanohydrin formation.  
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  Both A (NaHSO₃) and B (CH₃COOH) are incorrect for their respective reactions.

### Conclusion:
The correct reagents are **A = H₃O⁺** and **B = HCl**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A
