Okay, so I have this question about a Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step. 

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, I remember that the field strength tensor F is related to the electromagnetic field tensor, maybe? Or wait, in QED, F is the field tensor. But here, the Lagrangian looks a bit different. 

So first, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should probably look at the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. Remember, the Lagrangian has mass dimension 4 in 4 spacetime dimensions because the action is dimensionless, and the integral is over d^4 x (which has dimension -4, so the Lagrangian must have dimension 4 to make the action dimensionless).

Each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So, L_int must be dimension 4. Let's break down each part:

The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, then σ_{μν}, then ψ, and then F^{μν}. So the product ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν} should have the same dimension as L_int, which is 4, since L_int is this term multiplied by κ. Wait no, L_int is just that term, so the entire product (κ times the rest) must be dimension 4.

Wait, no. The Lagrangian term is L = κ [ψ̄ σ F ψ]. No, wait, no, the Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. So the entire term must have dimension 4. So:

[κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ_{μν}] + [ψ] + [F^{μν}] = 4.

Wait, but let me get the dimensions of each field and term right.

In 4 dimensions, the mass dimension for fields:

- Fermion fields ψ have dimension 3/2. Because in the Dirac Lagrangian, L = i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ - m ψ̄ ψ. The first term has derivative dimension (mass^1), and ψ is 3/2. So ∂_μ ψ is 3/2 +1=5/2. Then i ψ̄ γ ∂ψ would be [ψ̄] + [ψ] +1 (since ∂ is dimension 1). So [ψ̄] is 3/2, [ψ] is 3/2, so 3/2 +3/2 +1=4. Which matches the dimension of the Lagrangian. The mass term, m ψ̄ ψ, has dimension [m] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] = [m] +3. And since m has dimension 1, that's 4. So yes, everything adds up.

So [ψ] = [ψ̄] = 3/2.

What about σ_{μν}? σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_mu, gamma_nu]. Gamma matrices are dimensionless, as they're part of the spinor representation and don't carry mass dimension. So [σ_{μν}] is the same as the commutator, which is [γ_mu][γ_nu] since they anticommute but for dimension, the i/2 is dimensionless. So [σ_{μν}] = [γ_mu] [gamma_nu} ] = 0, since gammas are dimensionless.

Wait, no. The gamma matrices themselves are dimensionless. So σ_{mu nu} is a product of gamma matrices, so dimensionless. So [σ_{μν}] = 0.

Next, F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor. In electromagnetism, F_{mu nu} is built from ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. So each A has dimension 1. Because the Maxwell Lagrangian is F^2, which is (∂ A)^2. Since [∂] is 1, [A] must be 1 because [∂ A] is 1 + [A] = 2. So [F] is 2. Because F is ∂ A, which is dimension 1 + 1 = 2.

Wait, more accurately, F is the field tensor, which has terms like ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. Each term is [∂][A], so [F] = 1 +1 = 2.

So putting it all together, the term without κ is ψ̄ σ F ψ. Let's compute the dimension of that product.

ψ̄ is 3/2, σ is 0, F is 2, and ψ is 3/2. So adding them:

3/2 (ψ̄) + 0 (σ) + 2 (F) + 3/2 (ψ) = 3/2 + 3/2 +2 = 3 +2 =5.

So the product ψ̄ σ F ψ has dimension 5. But the Lagrangian term is κ multiplied by this. The Lagrangian must be dimension 4. So:

[κ] + [ψ̄ σ F ψ] = 4 → [κ] +5=4 → [κ]=-1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constant. In 4 dimensions, a theory is renormalizable if the coupling has dimension ≥0. Because the superficial degree of divergence is given by D = d - (n_c * D_c), where D_c is the dimension of each coupling term.

Wait, another approach: in a renormalizable theory, the coupling constants should have positive or zero mass dimension. Because the interaction terms must have dimension ≤4 (since the Lagrangian is dimension 4). So the coupling times the fields must combine to give dimension 4.

In our case, [κ] is -1, which is negative. So that's a bad sign for renormalizability. Because for the term to have the correct dimension, the coupling would need to have a dimension that allows the product to be 4. Since [coupling] + sum of [fields] =4.

In our case, the product without κ is 5, so κ must be -1 to make it 4. So the coupling has negative dimension, which implies that the theory is non-renormalizable. Because in quantum field theory, coupling constants with negative mass dimension lead to theories that are not renormalizable; you can't absorb the divergences because each loop brings in more factors of energy, leading to higher divergences that can't be canceled by the coupling's negative dimension. 

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The rule is that for a term to be renormalizable, the dimension of the coupling must be ≥0. Because in the Feynman diagram expansion, each vertex has a factor of the coupling. The superficial degree of divergence for a diagram is D = 4 - (sum of the dimensions of the couplings in the vertices). For the theory to be renormalizable, all possible superficial divergences (D≥0) must be renormalizable, which requires that all divergent diagrams can be absorbed by the existing coupling constants. 

If the coupling has negative dimension, then each vertex would contribute negatively to the superficial degree, meaning that D could be positive even for higher loop diagrams. Which would mean you need higher order terms (like counterterms with higher powers) which the theory doesn't have, making it non-renormalizable. 

So in our case, κ has dimension -1, which is negative. So the theory is not renormalizable.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about the term again. The interaction term is dimension 4, as it's part of the Lagrangian. So the coupling must adjust the dimension so that the Lagrangian is 4. So if the product of fields has higher dimension, the coupling must have negative to compensate.

So yes, [κ]=-1. Hence, the theory is not renormalizable.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: [κ]=-1, renormalizable. No, because if [κ] is -1, it's not renormalizable.

Option B: [κ]=1, renormalizable. No, because our calculation says -1.

Option C: [κ]=-1, not renormalizable. Yes, matches our conclusion.

Option D: [κ]=1, not renormalizable. No.

So the correct answer is C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu] \). 

### Step 1: Mass dimension of \( \kappa \)
In 4 spacetime dimensions, the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 to ensure the action is dimensionless. The term \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) must therefore also have mass dimension 4, as it is multiplied by \( \kappa \). Breaking down the dimensions of each component:
- \( [\bar{\psi}] = [\psi] = \frac{3}{2} \), as fermion fields have mass dimension \( \frac{3}{2} \).
- \( [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0 \), since \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is a commutator of dimensionless gamma matrices.
- \( [F^{\mu\nu}] = 2 \), as the field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) is constructed from derivatives of the gauge field \( A_\mu \), which has mass dimension 1.

Adding these dimensions:
\[
[\bar{\psi}] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, the coupling \( \kappa \) must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. This ensures that the interaction terms in the Lagrangian do not introduce higher-dimensional operators that cannot be absorbed by the existing terms during renormalization. In this case, \( [\kappa] = -1 \), which is negative. This implies that the theory is not renormalizable, as the coupling constant cannot absorb the divergences that arise in loop diagrams.

### Step 3: Evaluating the options
- **Option A**: \( [\kappa] = -1 \), theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the negative dimension of \( \kappa \) makes the theory non-renormalizable.
- **Option B**: \( [\kappa] = 1 \), theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the calculated dimension of \( \kappa \) is \( -1 \), not \( 1 \).
- **Option C**: \( [\kappa] = -1 \), theory is not renormalizable. **Correct**, as explained above.
- **Option D**: \( [\kappa] = 1 \), theory is not renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the dimension of \( \kappa \) is \( -1 \), not \( 1 \).

### Final Answer:
The mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is \( -1 \), and the theory is not renormalizable.
