Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me read through it again. The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and similarly, its mass is also 1.5 times larger. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, and the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question is, by what factor is the luminosity of Star_1 greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Wait, right, black body radiation. So I should think about the Stefan-Boltzmann law. That law says the luminosity L is proportional to R^2 * T^4, where R is radius and T is temperature. So L = 4πσR²T⁴, but since we're looking for a ratio, the constants would cancel out. So L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴).

But wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. I remember that for a black body, the peak wavelength λ_max is related to temperature by Wien's law. Wien's law is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Oh, because if λ_max is the same, then T is the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a minute. Radial velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, which I think means it's not moving towards or away from us. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Oh, but how does that affect the observed wavelength? Because Doppler shift affects the wavelength we observe. So if a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted, and moving away would cause redshift.

But they're measuring the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest. So the observed λ_max would be different due to Doppler shift. Wait, no, the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So when considering their actual emission, if they have the same intrinsic λ_max, but their observed wavelengths might differ due to radial velocity.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. If Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, its light would be blueshifted. So the observed λ_max for Star_2 would be shorter than its actual emitted λ_max. Similarly, if Star_1 is stationary, its observed λ_max is the same as its emitted. But the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is same for both. Hmm, that complicates things.

So let me think. The actual λ_max for each star depends on their temperature. But due to radial velocity, the observed λ_max is different. But the problem says the observed λ_max are the same. So what does that mean for their temperatures?

Let me set up some equations. Let me denote:

λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.

Star_1 is stationary, so λ_obs,1 = λ_emit,1.

Star_2 is moving towards us at velocity v = 700 km/s. So the Doppler effect formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - β) / (1 + β) ) ), where β = v/c.

Wait, but the Doppler shift formula for wavelength when moving towards us (blue shift) is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - β) / (1 + β) ) ), where β is v/c. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed wavelength is shorter than emitted.

But the problem says that λ_obs for both stars is the same. So λ_emit,1 = λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2 = λ_emit,2 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ).

Wait, let's denote λ1 as the emitted wavelength of Star_1, and λ2 as the emitted wavelength of Star_2. Because Star_1 is at rest, λ1 = λ_obs,1. For Star_2, λ_obs,2 = λ2 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ) ), and we know λ_obs,2 = λ_obs,1 = λ1.

So, λ1 = λ2 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

But from Wien's law, λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So λ1 = b / T1, λ2 = b / T2. So λ1/λ2 = T2 / T1.

Putting it all together:

T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

So T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

Now, going back to the luminosity ratio. L = 4πσ R² T⁴. So L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴ )

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.

So substituting R1 and R2:

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 * T2^4 )

Simplify R terms: (1.5² R2²) / R2² = 2.25.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

Which is 2.25 * (T1 / T2)^4.

But from earlier, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

So T1 / T2 = 1 / sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ) ) = sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

So (T1 / T2)^4 = [ (1+β)/(1-β) ) ]^2.

So putting it all together:

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [ (1 + β)^2 / (1 - β)^2 ) ]

Now, compute β: v = 700 km/s. Let's compute β = v/c. The speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, so 300,000 km/s.

So β = 700 / 300000 ≈ 0.0023333.

So 1 + β ≈ 1.0023333, 1 - β ≈ 0.9976666.

Compute (1 + β)/(1 - β) = (1.0023333)/(0.9976666) ≈ 1.00468.

Then, [ (1+β)/(1-β) ) ]^2 = (1.00468)^2 ≈ 1.00938.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. Let me compute the ratio (1+β)/(1-β):

(1 + 0.0023333) / (1 - 0.0023333) = (1.0023333) / (0.9976667) ≈ 1.00468.

So squaring that: 1.00468^2 ≈ 1.00938.

So now, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00938 ≈ 2.25 * approx 1.0094.

So 2.25 * 1.0094 = ?

2.25 * 1 = 2.25.

2.25 * 0.0094 = approximately 0.02115.

Adding them: 2.25 + 0.02115 ≈ 2.27115.

Wait, but wait, this gives L1/L2 ≈ 2.27. Looking at the options:

Options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23.

Hmm, so 2.27 is not exactly matching any, but let me check the calculation again because maybe I made a mistake in the steps.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the Doppler factor accurately.

Let me compute (1 + β)/(1 - β):

β = 700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300000 = 7/(3000) = approx 0.0023333.

So 1 + β = 1.0023333, 1 - β = 0.9976667.

Divide them: (1.0023333)/(0.9976667) = let's compute that.

Let me compute using approximate fraction. Let me think, 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s, but maybe exact calculation isn't necessary since the effect is small.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the exact value.

Let me compute (1 + β) = 1.0023333333...

(1 - β) = 0.9976666666...

So (1.0023333333)/(0.9976666666) = (10023333.333e-7) / (9976666.666e-7) = (10023333.3333)/(9976666.6666) ≈ 1.00468.

So the ratio is approximately 1.00468.

So when I square that, (1.00468)^2 = ?

Let me compute (1 + x)^2 where x=0.00468:

≈ 1 + 2x + x². So 1 + 2*(0.00468) + (0.00468)^2.

= 1 + 0.00936 + 0.0000219.

≈ 1.0093819.

So [ (1+β)/(1-β) ]^2 ≈ 1.00938.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00938 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00938.

Let me compute that. 2.25 * 1.00938.

2.25 * 1 = 2.25.

2.25 * 0.00938 = ? 

0.00938 * 2.25:

0.009 * 2.25 = 0.02025.

0.00038 * 2.25 = 0.000855.

So total 0.02025 + 0.000855 = 0.021105.

Adding to 2.25 gives 2.271105.

So approximately 2.271.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B) ~2.32, but that’s a bit higher than 2.27. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the Doppler factor more accurately. Let me compute (1 + β)/(1 - β) precisely.

Compute β: 700 / (3e5) = 700 / 300000 = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.00233333333.

So (1 + β) = 1.00233333333, (1 - β) = 0.99766666667.

Their ratio: 1.00233333333 / 0.99766666667.

Let me compute this division:

Let me compute numerator = 1.00233333333, denominator = 0.99766666667.

Approximate as:

numerator = 1 + 0.00233333333.

denominator = 1 - 0.00233333333.

So (1 + a)/(1 - a) ≈ 1 + 2a when a is small. Let's check:

a = 0.00233333333.

So 1 + 2a = 1 + 0.00466666666 = 1.00466666666.

But the actual value is 1.00233333333 / 0.99766666667.

Wait, let me compute it as (1.00233333333) / (0.99766666667) = ?

Let me compute this division. Let me think, 0.9976666667 is approximately 997666.6667e-3, and 1.00233333333 is 1002333.3333e-3.

So 1002333.3333 / 997666.6667 ≈ (1002333.3333) / (997666.6667) ≈ approximately 1.00467.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it more accurately. Let me set a = 2333.33333e-6, so:

(1 + a) / (1 - a) = [ (1 + a) ] * [ (1 + a)/(1 - a) ) ]? Wait, perhaps another approach.

Alternatively, let me compute it as (1.0023333333)/(0.9976666667).

Let me compute this division:

1.0023333333 ÷ 0.9976666667.

Let me approximate 0.9976666667 as 1 - 0.0023333333.

So, 1.0023333333 / (1 - 0.0023333333) ≈ (1.0023333333) * [1 + 0.0023333333 + (0.0023333333)^2 + ... ] up to a few terms, since a is small.

So, approximately, 1.0023333333 * (1 + 0.0023333333 + (0.0023333333)^2 )

= 1.0023333333 * 1.0023333333 + ... up to the square. Let me compute that:

1.0023333333 * 1.0023333333 = ?

Let me compute 1.0023333333 multiplied by itself.

1.0023333333 * 1.0023333333:

= (1 + 0.0023333333)^2

= 1 + 2*(0.0023333333) + (0.0023333333)^2

= 1 + 0.0046666666 + 0.0000054444 ≈ 1.004672111.

So, (1 + a)/(1 - a) ≈ 1.004672111.

But wait, I think the actual calculation is (1.0023333333) / (0.9976666667) = ?

Wait, 0.9976666667 is 1 - 0.0023333333, so 1/(0.9976666667) = 1/(1 - 0.0023333333) ≈ 1 + 0.0023333333 + (0.0023333333)^2 + ... So, 1.0023333333 + (0.0023333333)^2 ≈ 1.0023333333 + 0.0000054444 ≈ 1.0023387777.

Then, multiplying by 1.0023333333:

1.0023333333 * 1.0023387777 ≈ ?

Let me compute this:

1 * 1.0023387777 = 1.0023387777.

0.0023333333 * 1.0023387777 ≈ 0.0023333333 * 1 ≈ 0.0023333333, plus 0.0023333333 * 0.0023387777 ≈ approx 0.000005466.

So total approx 0.0023388.

So total product: 1.0023387777 + 0.0023388 ≈ 1.0046775777.

So approximately 1.0046776.

Wait, but earlier I had 1.004672. Hmm, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than necessary. Let me just take the ratio as approximately 1.004677.

So (1 + β)/(1 - β) ≈ 1.004677.

Then, the square of that is [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ]^2 ≈ (1.004677)^2.

Compute 1.004677 squared:

= (1 + 0.004677)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.004677) + (0.004677)^2.

= 1 + 0.009354 + 0.00002187.

≈ 1.00937587.

So [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ]^2 ≈ 1.009376.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.009376 ≈ Let me compute that.

2.25 * 1.009376.

Well, 2 * 1.009376 is 2.018752.

0.25 * 1.009376 = 0.252344.

So summing them: 2.018752 + 0.252344 = 2.271096.

So about 2.2711.

Looking at the options, that's approximately 2.27. The options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23.

Hmm, 2.27 isn't exactly any of these. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars, but due to Doppler shift, the emitting λ_max (the actual peak emission) is different.

Wait, let me re-express that.

Star_1 is at rest, so the observed λ_max1 = λ_emit1.

Star_2 is moving towards us at velocity v, so observed λ_max2 = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

But the problem states that the observed λ_max1 = observed λ_max2, so:

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

But from Wien's law, λ_emit = b/T, so:

λ_emit1 = b/(T1), λ_emit2 = b/(T2).

So,

b/(T1) = (b/(T2)) * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

Take reciprocal of both sides:

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

So T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

So T1/T2 = sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

Thus, (T1 / T2)^4 = [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ]^2.

So back to the luminosity ratio:

L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 ) = ( (1.5 R2)^2 / R2^2 ) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= (2.25) * [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ]^2.

Which is what I had earlier.

So with β = 700 / 3e5 = 0.0023333333.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ]^2 more accurately.

Let me compute (1 + β)/(1 - β) precisely.

Compute (1 + 0.00233333333) = 1.0023333333.

(1 - 0.00233333333) = 0.9976666667.

So the ratio is 1.0023333333 / 0.9976666667.

Let me compute this division:

Let me write it as (1.0023333333) / (0.9976666667) = ?

I think the exact value is important here. Let me compute 1.0023333333 ÷ 0.9976666667.

We can think of this as 1.0023333333 * (1/0.9976666667).

1/0.9976666667 is approximately 1.002338776.

So 1.0023333333 * 1.002338776 ≈ ?

Let me compute this product.

First, 1 * 1.002338776 = 1.002338776.

0.0023333333 * 1.002338776 = ?

Compute 0.0023333333 * 1.002338776:

= 0.0023333333 * 1 = 0.0023333333.

+ 0.0023333333 * 0.002338776 ≈ 0.000005466.

So total ≈ 0.0023333333 + 0.000005466 ≈ 0.002338799.

So the total product is 1.002338776 + 0.002338799 ≈ 1.004677575.

So (1 + β)/(1 - β) ≈ 1.004677575.

So [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ]^2 = (1.004677575)^2.

Compute 1.004677575 squared:

= 1 + 2*(0.004677575) + (0.004677575)^2.

= 1 + 0.00935515 + (approx 0.00002187).

So total ≈ 1.009376.

So [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ]^2 ≈ 1.009376.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.009376 ≈ 2.271096.

Which is approximately 2.271.

Looking at the options again, the closest is option B) ~2.32, but that's higher. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the Doppler shift factor.

Wait, perhaps I should consider relativistic Doppler shift. Oh wait, the formula I used is the relativistic Doppler shift for wavelength. So λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ) when moving towards us. Alternatively, for a source moving towards us, the observed frequency is higher, so wavelength is shorter.

Wait, another approach: the formula for the Doppler shift when the source is moving towards the observer is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ), where β = v/c.

But perhaps I should have used the transverse Doppler effect? Or is radial velocity the same as longitudinal?

Wait, no, the problem states radial velocities, which are along the line of sight, so longitudinal Doppler effect applies here.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should be using the relativistic Doppler shift formula for frequency, and then relate it to wavelength. Let me think: the relativistic Doppler shift formula for frequency is f_obs = f_emit * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ), when the source is moving towards the observer. So for frequency, the observed frequency is higher, so wavelength is shorter: λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ).

Wait, but in this problem, we're given that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.

So,

λ_emit,1 * sqrt( (1 - 0)/(1 + 0) ) = λ_emit,2 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

Because Star_1 has v=0, so beta is 0. So sqrt(1/(1)) = 1.

So,

λ_emit,1 = λ_emit,2 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

But from Wien's law, λ_emit = b / T.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

So,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

So,

T1^4 / T2^4 = [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ]^2.

Thus, the luminosity ratio:

L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 ) = ( (1.5 R2)^2 / R2^2 ) * ( [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ]^2 )

= 2.25 * [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ]^2.

With beta = 700e3 m/s / 3e8 m/s = 7e2 / 3e8 = 7/(3e5) = 0.0023333333.

So,

(1 + β) = 1.0023333333, (1 - β) = 0.9976666667.

So,

(1 + β)/(1 - β) ≈ 1.004677575.

Square that: ≈ 1.009376.

Multiply by 2.25:

2.25 * 1.009376 ≈ 2.271096.

Which is approximately 2.27.

But looking at the options, none exactly match. The closest is option B) ~2.32. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ]^2.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocity is 700 km/s, so I should calculate it as v = 700,000 m/s (700 km/s) and c = 3e8 m/s, then beta is 700000 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) = 0.02333333333.

Wait, wait, wait! Oh no, I think I made a mistake in calculating beta. 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s. So beta is (700,000) / (3e8) = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.02333333333.

Oh, wait a minute! Oh no, I think I messed up the calculation of beta earlier. Because 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s, so beta = 700,000 / 3e8 = 0.002333333333333... Wait, no, 700,000 divided by 3e8 is 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) = 0.023333333333... Wait, no, 7e5 is 700,000, 3e8 is 300,000,000.

So 700,000 / 300,000,000 = (7e5)/(3e8) = (7/3) * (1e5 / 1e8) ) = (7/3) * 1e-3 = 7/(3000) ≈ 0.00233333333333.

Wait, yes, that's correct. So beta is 0.00233333333333.

So my earlier calculation was correct.

Wait, but perhaps the options are based on a non-relativistic Doppler shift approximation. Because when v is much smaller than c, the Doppler shift can be approximated as Δλ/λ ≈ v/c.

Wait, but in this case, the exact formula is used, so the relativistic Doppler shift applies.

So, given that, perhaps the correct factor is approximately 2.27, but the options don't have it.

Wait, looking back at the options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23.

Hmm, so 2.27 is between options A and B. Let me think about possible calculation mistakes.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate [ (1+beta)/(1-beta) ]^2, using beta=0.0023333333.

Compute (1 + beta) = 1.0023333333.

(1 - beta) = 0.9976666667.

So (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) = 1.0023333333 / 0.9976666667.

Let me compute this division as 1.0023333333 ÷ 0.9976666667.

Let me compute it more accurately. Let me compute 1.0023333333 ÷ 0.9976666667.

Let me compute this as:

Let me compute 0.9976666667 * 1.00467 = ?

0.9976666667 * 1.00467 = approx.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute via cross-multiplied fractions.

Wait, 1.0023333333 ÷ 0.9976666667.

Let me compute 1.0023333333 ÷ 0.9976666667.

= (100233333.333e-8) / (99766666.6667e-8) ) 

= (100233333.333) / (99766666.6667) 

This can be approximated as:

(100,233,333.333) / (99,766,666.6667) 

= (approx) 1.00467.

So (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ≈ 1.00467.

Then, [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ]^2 = (1.00467)^2 ≈ 1.00937.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00937 ≈ 2.2711.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is approximately 2.27, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I need to re-examine the question.

Wait, the problem states that the luminosities are calculated assuming the stars radiate as black bodies. So the calculation should be correct. But the options are given as approximately 2.25, 2.32, 2.35, 2.23.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler shift is affecting the luminosity calculation in a different way. Wait, no, the luminosity is intrinsic. The observed flux would be affected, but the question is about the intrinsic luminosity. So the approach is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift equation. Let me double-check the Doppler shift formula.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - β) / (1 + β) )

Yes, that's correct when the source is moving towards the observer.

So, given that, the calculation is correct.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.27, but none of the options match exactly. The closest options are A) 2.25 and B) 2.32.

Wait, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the Doppler effect and just compute L based on R and T, assuming same T. Because if T is same, then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, which is option A.

But the problem states that the observed λ_max is same, which implies that the temperatures are different due to Doppler shift. So we have to include the Doppler effect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the temperature using the Doppler shift.

Wait, let me re-express the problem.

Given that the observed λ_max is same for both stars, but their actual emitted wavelengths are different because of their velocities.

So, from observed λ_max = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

But since observed λ_max is same for both stars, we have:

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

But from Wien's law, λ_emit = b / T.

So, T_emit1 = T_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

So the temperatures are different.

Thus, the luminosity ratio is:

L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

= ( (1.5 R2)^2 / R2^2 ) * ( T1^4 / T2^4 )

= 2.25 * ( (T1 / T2) )^4 

But (T1/T2) = sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

So,

(T1/T2)^4 = [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ]^2 

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ]^2 

With beta = 700/3e5 = 0.0023333333.

So,

(1 + beta) = 1.0023333333

(1 - beta) = 0.9976666667

(1 + beta)/(1 - beta) = 1.0023333333 / 0.9976666667 ≈ 1.004677575.

Squared: (1.004677575)^2 ≈ 1.009376.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.009376 ≈ 2.271.

But again, the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is 2.25, but that would be if the Doppler shift is ignored, which would be incorrect according to the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the process.

Wait, wait, another approach: perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed temperature, but the intrinsic luminosity calculation uses the intrinsic temperature.

Wait, but the problem says "assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of..."

So the luminosity is computed based on their intrinsic T, not the observed T. Because when you compute the luminosity, you use the intrinsic properties, not observed.

Wait, but in our calculation, the observed λ_max is same, which allows us to compute the intrinsic T.

Wait, no, the observed λ_max is same, so we can compute their intrinsic λ_emit, which depends on their T.

So the earlier approach is correct.

But perhaps the problem expects us to compute the observed flux, which would take into account the Doppler shift.

Wait, but the flux depends on the Doppler shift as well. But the question is about luminosity, not flux. Luminosity is intrinsic, so it's independent of distance, but depends on R and T.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between flux and luminosity. The problem says astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So the calculation is correct.

But the options don't include 2.27, which is what I'm getting. So perhaps there's a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the radial velocity is for Star_2, which is moving away from us. But the problem says radial velocity is 700 km/s for Star_2; it doesn't specify direction, just that Star_1 has 0. So perhaps I should consider it as moving away, which would cause a redshift.

Wait, if Star_2 is moving away, then the observed λ would be longer than emitted. But the problem says the observed λ_max is same for both stars. So if Star_2 is moving away, the observed λ_max would be longer than its emitted, but Star_1's observed λ_max is same as emitted. So to have same observed λ_max, the emitted λ_max of Star_2 would be shorter.

Which would imply that Star_2's temperature is higher than Star_1's, as λ_max is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, perhaps I got the Doppler shift direction wrong earlier.

Wait, if the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ), where beta is positive when moving away.

Wait, no, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is: λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ), where beta is positive.

Wait, I think I may have made a mistake in the Doppler formula direction.

Let me clarify: when the source is moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength is shorter (blue shift), so λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ).

When the source is moving away, λ_obs is longer, so λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ).

So in this problem, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. The problem doesn't specify direction, but radial velocity could be positive or negative. However, in the problem statement, perhaps it's moving away.

Wait, but the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2. It doesn't specify direction. Commonly, radial velocity is given as positive when moving away, but perhaps the sign is important.

But in our earlier calculation, we considered Star_2 moving towards us, which gives a blueshift. But if Star_2 is moving away, then its observed λ_obs would be longer than emitted, so λ_emit,2 = λ_obs,2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ), where beta is positive (since moving away).

Wait, perhaps I should redo the analysis considering Star_2 is moving away.

In that case, for Star_2:

λ_obs,2 = λ_emit,2 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

But since λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2,

λ_emit,1 = λ_emit,2 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Because Star_1 is at rest, λ_obs,1 = λ_emit,1.

So,

λ_emit,1 = λ_emit,2 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

But from Wien's law,

λ_emit,1 = b / T1,

λ_emit,2 = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

=> 1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

=> T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So,

T1/T2 = sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Thus,

(T1/T2)^4 = [ (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ]^2.

So the luminosity ratio becomes:

L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

= ( (1.5 R2)^2 / R2^2 ) * [ ( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )^2 ]

= 2.25 * [ (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )^2 ]

With beta = 700e3 m/s / 3e8 m/s = 0.002333333333.

So,

(1 - beta) = 0.9976666667,

(1 + beta) = 1.0023333333,

(1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ≈ 0.9976666667 / 1.0023333333 ≈ 0.9953333333.

So,

[ (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ]^2 ≈ (0.9953333333)^2 ≈ 0.9907111111.

Thus,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907111111 ≈ 2.228.

Hmm, that's approximately 2.23, which is option D.

But wait, this is under the assumption that Star_2 is moving away, which would give a lower temperature for Star_1 compared to our earlier calculation.

But the problem states that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. It doesn't specify direction, but typically, radial velocity is reported as positive when moving away. So perhaps Star_2 is moving away, giving a redshift.

So in this case, the luminosity ratio is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

So the correct answer would be D) ~2.23.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi \sigma R^2 T^4
\]

The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Relating Radii
The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Relating Temperatures
The problem specifies that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (\(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\)) are the same for both stars. Using Wien's law, the intrinsic emission wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature:

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

For Star_1 (at rest), the observed wavelength is equal to the emitted wavelength:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,1}}
\]

For Star_2 (moving with radial velocity \(v = 700 \, \text{km/s}\)), the observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by the relativistic Doppler shift formula:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}}
\]

where \(\beta = v/c = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333\). Since \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\), we equate the two expressions:

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}}
\]

Using \(\lambda_{\text{emit}} = \frac{b}{T}\), this becomes:

\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \sqrt{\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}}
\]

Canceling \(b\):

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{T_2} \sqrt{\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}\right)^2
\]

### Step 3: Substituting Values
Substitute \(\beta = 0.002333\):

\[
\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta} = \frac{1.002333}{0.997667} \approx 1.004677
\]

Squaring this:

\[
\left(\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}\right)^2 \approx 1.009376
\]

Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx 1.009376
\]

### Step 4: Calculating Luminosity Ratio
Substitute into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 1.009376 \approx 2.271
\]

### Step 5: Considering Radial Velocity Direction
If Star_2 is moving away (redshift), the Doppler shift formula changes to:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}
\]

Repeating the calculation with this assumption gives:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}}
\]

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}\right)^2 \approx 0.990711
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.990711 \approx 2.228
\]

This rounds to approximately **2.23**, which matches option D.

### Final Answer:
The closest match to the calculated luminosity ratio is:
