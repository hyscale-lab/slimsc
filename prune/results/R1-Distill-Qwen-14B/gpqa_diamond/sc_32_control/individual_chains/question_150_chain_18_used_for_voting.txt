Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think it through carefully. Let's start by reading the question and understanding what's being asked.

The problem says that a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO reacts with a series of reagents. The first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl, the second is water, and the third is aqueous KOH and heat. I need to figure out what the final product is based on the given NMR data and the options provided.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So that's (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be like a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and a carbonyl (another 1), or maybe a ring and some double bonds.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift. Could be an aldehyde proton because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe it's an aldehyde next to a CH2 group.

- 6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H. This is in the aromatic region. A doublet might indicate two equivalent protons next to substituents on a benzene ring. Maybe para-substituted.

- 6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H. Also aromatic. Another set of two equivalent protons. Could be another para-substituted ring, maybe ortho to something else.

- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something like an -OH group. Or perhaps it's vinyl protons that are coupled but broad because of rapid exchange. Alternatively, maybe it's adjacent to an electronegative group.

- 3.66 ppm, doublet, 2H. This is around the CH2O region. Could be a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2 or CH2O.

Putting this together, I'm thinking maybe a benzaldehyde derivative. The aldehyde proton at 9.72 ppm, maybe attached to a carbon that's next to a CH2 group. The two aromatic doublets suggest two para-substituted benzene rings. The 6.27 ppm could be a CH2 group that's part of an enol or adjacent to an oxygen. Or maybe it's a vinyl group.

Wait, let me think about the structure. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me try to count the carbons. Suppose we have a benzene ring (6 C), then maybe two substituents. Alternatively, perhaps a benzaldehyde group. Let me see: if there's a benzaldehyde (C7H7O), then perhaps another substituent.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. So that leaves another group: C1H3NO. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the compound has a benzene ring attached to a side chain that includes a carbonyl group.

The NMR shows an aldehyde proton, so maybe there's an aldehyde (RCHO). The 3.66 ppm could be a CH2 next to an oxygen. Let's think about possible structures.

Another thought: The aldehyde is at one end, and perhaps the compound has a side chain with a double bond and some substituents. The 6.27 ppm could be the protons on a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps as an enol or something.

Wait, let's think about the reagents. The first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl. That's usually used for diazotization, which happens with aromatic amines, especially aniline derivatives. So the starting compound probably has an aromatic amine group. But then, after that, they're adding H2O and KOH with heat.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So, perhaps the compound is a benzylamine derivative with an aldehyde group. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Alternatively, the compound could have a nitro group (NO2), but that's not present in the formula. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So, perhaps it's an aniline derivative (NH2 attached to benzene) with other substituents.

But wait, the NMR doesn't show any NH signals. The only possible NH would be in an aniline, but maybe it's deprotonated or not showing up. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitro group, but that's not in the formula. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR has a triplet at 9.72 ppm. If that's an aldehyde, then perhaps the structure is something like Ph-CH2-CHO? But that would be C8H8O, but the formula is C8H9NO. Hmm.

Wait, let's count. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. If there's another benzene ring attached, that would be more carbons. Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like diphenylmethanol, but that's with an alcohol group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that includes an amine. But the formula includes N, which I haven't considered yet. So, maybe there's an -NH2 group somewhere.

Wait, the starting compound has a molecular formula of C8H9NO. That's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, 1 oxygen. Let me think of possible functional groups. It has N, O. If it's an aromatic amine, perhaps a primary amine attached to a benzene ring, and another substituent that's an aldehyde.

Alternatively, maybe it's a secondary amine, but that's less common for diazotization. Diazotization typically occurs with aromatic amines, especially primary ones.

So, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with an -NH2 group and another substituent which is an aldehyde. But the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Wait, benzene is 6 C. So the substituents would be two groups: one aldehyde (CHO, which is 1 C) and one NH2 (which is 1 N, 2 H). But wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So, 6 C in benzene, one in aldehyde, and another in the amine substituent? Wait, no. Wait, NH2 is part of the ring substituent, so perhaps the substituent is -CH2NH2 or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a benzylamine derivative. For example, perhaps the compound is 4-aminobenzaldehyde. But 4-aminobenzaldehyde's formula is C7H7NO. Wait, our compound is C8H9NO. So that's one carbon more. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps a benzaldehyde with an ethyl group that includes an amine. Or maybe a side chain with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an aniline with a side chain. For example, benzene ring with an amino group and a CH2CH2CHO group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the NMR again. The triplet at 9.72 ppm is the aldehyde proton. It's a triplet, so it's coupling with two protons. So the aldehyde is attached to a CH2 group. So the structure would have RCHO where R is CH2- something.

So, the aldehyde is CH2-CHO, but that's a carbonyl group. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CHO. So the aldehyde is at the end, but that would have a CH2 group next to it. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of a larger chain.

Wait, the 3.66 ppm doublet is 2H. That could be a CH2 group attached to an oxygen. So maybe CH2-O-... or CH2 adjacent to an oxygen.

Let me think about possible structures. Suppose the molecule is something like Ph-CH2-CHO, but that would be C9H10O, which doesn't match the formula. Hmm.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate possible degrees of saturation again. 5, so 5 rings or double bonds. So perhaps one benzene ring (3 rings), one double bond (1), and a carbonyl group (1), and another double bond? Or maybe a ring and some double bonds.

Wait, another approach: The NMR shows two doublets in the aromatic region. Maybe there are two para-substituted benzene rings. So if the molecule is something like diphenyl something, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a substituent that's a nitro group, but the formula doesn't have NO2. Hmm.

Wait, the reagents: first step is NaNO2 and HCl. That's usually for diazotization, which requires an aromatic amine. So, the starting compound probably has an -NH2 group attached to a benzene ring. Then, when treated with NaNO2 and HCl, it forms a diazonium salt. Then, when heated with H2O, perhaps a hydrolysis occurs, like forming a phenol. Then, the third step is KOH and heat, which might cause elimination or some other reaction.

Wait, but the starting material is C8H9NO. So, if it's an aromatic amine, perhaps 4-aminobenzaldehyde. But that's C7H7NO, which is one carbon less than needed. Hmm. Or maybe it's a more complex substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-(aminophenyl)but-3-enal. So, a benzene ring attached to a CH2-CH2-CHO group? Wait, but that would be C10H11NO, which is too big. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a benzaldehyde with an aminoethyl group. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me try to think about the reaction steps. The first step is diazotization, which converts an aromatic amine to a diazonium salt. Then, in the presence of water, perhaps the diazonium group is hydrolyzed. For example, in aqueous conditions, diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis to form phenols or other products, like in the production of phenol from aniline.

So, perhaps the starting compound is an aniline derivative, and after diazotization and hydrolysis, it becomes a phenol. Then, the third step is treatment with KOH and heat, which might cause an elimination reaction, perhaps forming a double bond.

Wait, but the initial NMR suggests an aldehyde is present. So, the starting compound must have an aldehyde group. So, maybe the structure is something like 4-aminobenzaldehyde, which upon diazotization and hydrolysis becomes 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Then, when treated with KOH and heat, perhaps an elimination occurs, forming an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde.

But let's check the molecular formula. 4-aminobenzaldehyde is C7H7NO. Our compound is C8H9NO, which is one carbon more. Hmm. So maybe it's a substituted benzaldehyde with an amine group on a branch.

Wait, another thought: the starting compound might be 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzaldehyde. That would have the structure Ph-CH2-CH2-NH2, but that's two more carbons than benzaldehyde. Wait, no, let's see: benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Adding a CH2CH2NH2 group would add 3 more carbons, making it C10H12ON. But our formula is C8H9NO, which is C8, so perhaps a shorter chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 4-(aminopropyl)benzaldehyde, but that would add more carbons.

Wait, another approach: Let's look at the options provided. The options are all aldehydes with diphenyl groups or similar.

Option A: 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal. So that's a four-carbon chain with double bond at position 3, and phenyl groups at 2 and 4.

Option B: 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal. So a four-carbon chain with a double bond at position 2, and 4-hydroxyphenyl groups at 2 and 4.

Option C: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. So a four-carbon chain with a hydroxyl at position 3, and two 4-hydroxyphenyl groups.

Option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. A four-carbon chain with a double bond at position 3 and a 4-hydroxyphenyl group at position 4.

Hmm. So all options are aldehydes with diphenyl substituents or similar.

Now, considering the reaction steps. The starting material has an NH2 group. When treated with NaNO2 and HCl, it forms a diazonium salt. Then treated with water, which likely hydrolyzes the diazonium group to a hydroxyl, forming a phenol. Then, treated with aqueous KOH and heat, perhaps an elimination occurs.

Wait, so if the starting material has an amino group, after hydrolysis, it becomes a hydroxyl. Then, when KOH and heat are applied, maybe an E2 elimination occurs, forming a double bond.

So, the initial structure would be something like diphenylbutanamine, but that's just a guess.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 2,4-diphenylbutan-1-amine. So, structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-NH2-Ph? No, that doesn't quite fit.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-amino-2-phenylbut-3-enal. Let me think: the formula would be C13H13N something. No, that's getting too big.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about each step.

Step 1: NaNO2 and HCl – diazotization. So the starting material must have an aromatic amine.

Step 2: H2O. Diazonium salt hydrolysis typically gives phenol. So if the starting material is arylamine, after step 2 it becomes aryl-OH.

Step 3: aqueous KOH and heat. This is likely an elimination reaction, perhaps forming a double bond. So, if there's an -OH and adjacent -CH2 groups, elimination could form an alkene.

So, putting it all together: the starting material is an aromatic amine attached to a chain that has an aldehyde group and perhaps a substituent that, upon elimination, forms a double bond.

Wait, let's think about the initial NMR. The aldehyde proton is at 9.72 ppm, which is a triplet. So maybe it's RCHO, where R is a CH2 group. So R could be CH2-CH2-OH or something else.

Wait, the initial NMR also has 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. That could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, or perhaps an enol proton.

Wait, maybe the starting compound is a benzaldehyde derivative with an amino group adjacent to a CH2O group. For example, something like Ph-CH2-CH(NH2)-CHO. Hmm, but let's check the formula.

Ph is C6H5. So Ph-CH2-CH(NH2)-CHO would be C6H5-CH2-CH(NH2)-CHO. The formula would be C9H11N O2. Our starting material is C8H9NO. Hmm, that's not matching.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Alternative approach: Let's look at the options and see which one fits the reaction steps.

Option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. Structure would be:

O=CH-CH2-CH2-Ph-OH, but wait, no. Wait, buten-al means a double bond. So but-3-enal is CH2=CH-CH2-CHO. But with a 4-hydroxyphenyl group on position 4. Wait, but but-3-enal is O=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, butenals have four carbons. So but-3-enal is CH2=CHCH2CHO.

But wait, with a 4-hydroxyphenyl group on position 4. Hmm, maybe it's Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO. No, perhaps it's Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but that's a single bond.

Alternatively, the structure could be Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but that would be butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CH=CHO. Wait, but that's 3-pentenal or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-CHO. That's a pentyl group attached to benzene. But the double bonds would come from elimination during the third reaction step.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-NH2-CHO. That seems complicated, but let's see.

Wait, maybe the starting material is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde. Structure would be PhNH2-CH2-CHO. But the molecular formula would be C8H9NO. Let's calculate:

Ph is C6H5, then CH2-CHO is C2H3O, so total C8, H: 5 (Ph) + 2 (CH2) + 1 (CHO) = 8 H? Wait, no. Wait, Ph is C6H5, then CH2-CHO is C2H3O. So the molecular formula would be C6+2=8 C, H: 5 (Ph) + 2 (CH2) + 1 (CHO) = 8 H. Wait, but the formula is C8H9NO. So 8 H, but this structure would have 5 + 2 + 1 = 8 H. Plus, the amine has NH2: so each NH2 contributes 2 H. Wait, no, in the structure Ph-CH2-CH2-NH2, the H count would be different.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-NH2, but that's C9H11N. Hmm, but our formula is C8H9NO.

Alternatively, the starting compound is 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzaldehyde. Structure: Ph-CH2-CH2-NH2-CHO. Wait, but that might have more carbons. Let me count:

Ph (6 C) + CH2 (2 C) + NH2 (no C) + CHO (1 C) = 6+2+1=9 C. But our formula is C8, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe it's 4-aminobenzaldehyde. Which is C7H7NO. But our formula is C8H9NO. So that's one carbon more. Hmm.

Perhaps the starting compound is 4-aminophenylpropanal. Structure: Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO with an NH2 group. Wait, but that would have C6 (Ph) + 3 (propanal) = C9, which is more than C8.

Hmm. This is getting a bit tricky. Let's try to think of the reaction steps again.

First step: Diazotization forms a diazonium salt. Second step: Hydrolysis of diazonium to phenol. Third step: KOH and heat likely induces elimination, maybe forming a double bond.

So, the starting compound has an aromatic amine and an aldehyde group. Upon hydrolysis, the amine becomes a hydroxyl. Then, perhaps elimination forms a double bond between the aldehyde group and the rest of the chain.

Wait, but the aldehyde is a carbonyl group, which doesn't typically undergo elimination. Unless there's an adjacent proton.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has an -NH2 group next to a CH2 group, which upon elimination forms a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the starting structure is 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzaldehyde. So, Ph-CH2-CH2-NH2 with a CHO group attached. Wait, no, that would be a longer chain.

Another thought: Maybe the starting compound is 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzaldehyde. Structure: Ph-CH2-CH2-NH2-CHO. No, that would have 6 (Ph) + 4 (CH2-CH2-NH2-CHO) = 10 C, which is too much.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzylamine derivative with an aldehyde group attached to the chain. For example, Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-NH2-CHO. But that's again too long.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde. Structure: Ph-CH2-CHO with an NH2 group attached. Wait, but where? If it's attached to the benzene ring, that would be 4-aminobenzaldehyde (PhNH2CHO), which is C7H7NO, but our formula is C8H9NO. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the starting material is 4-(aminomethyl)benzaldehyde. Structure: Ph-CH2-NH2-CHO. But that's two substituents on the benzene, which might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a secondary amine, but I don't think that's correct because diazotization typically occurs with primary amines.

Another angle: Let's think about the product options.

Option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. Structure: OHC-CH2-CH2-Ph-OH. But wait, but-3-enal would be CH2=CH-CH2-CHO. So if the phenyl is attached to the third carbon, it would be CH2-Ph-OH-CH2-CHO? Not sure. Alternatively, the structure would be Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the product after elimination is an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde. So, from the starting material, which had a CH2 group next to an OH, elimination would form a double bond between the aldehyde and the adjacent carbon.

Wait, perhaps the starting material after step 2 (hydrolysis) is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHOH-CHO. Then, treatment with KOH would eliminate H2O, forming a double bond between the two CH2 groups, giving Ph-CH2-CH=CHO. But that would be but-2-enal?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a structure where after elimination, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So, perhaps the initial structure after hydrolysis is Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CHO. Then elimination would form Ph-CH2-CH=CH-CHO, which is but-2-enal with a phenyl group.

But I'm not sure how this connects with the NMR.

Wait, let me go back to the NMR data of the starting material. The triplet at 9.72 ppm (1H) is probably an aldehyde. The 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) is likely a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. The 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) could be protons adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps in an enol form.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde with an adjacent aminoethyl group. So, structure: Ph-CH2-CH2-NH2-CHO. No, that can't be right because that would have more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CHO, with an NH2 group on the benzene ring. But that's 4-aminobenzaldehyde, which is C7H7NO. Our starting material is C8H9NO. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-phenylpropylamine benzaldehyde. No, that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like Ph-CH2-CH(NH2)-CHO. That would be C8H9NO. Let's calculate:

Ph (C6H5) + CH2 (1C) + CH(NH2) (1C) + CHO (1C) = 6+1+1+1=9 C. No, that's 9 C, but the formula is C8. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the structure is Ph-CH2-CHO with an NH2 group attached to the CH2. So, Ph-CH(NH2)-CHO. That would be C8H8N O. But our formula is C8H9NO. So, the H count doesn't match. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO with an NH2 group somewhere. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a phenyl-substituted aminoacetaldehyde. Structure: Ph-CH2-CH2-NH2-CHO. But that's C8H10N O, which doesn't match the formula.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the reaction steps again.

After the first step (diazotization), the amine becomes a diazonium salt. Then, hydrolysis in step 2 replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group. So, if the starting material is 4-aminobenzaldehyde (PhNH2-CHO), after step 2 it becomes 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (PhOH-CHO). Then, step 3 is KOH and heat. What would happen then?

4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (salicylaldehyde) under basic conditions with heat might undergo some kind of elimination. But salicylaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with a hydroxyl group in the para position. Would KOH cause elimination? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde. Structure: Ph-CH2-CHO with an NH2 group. Wait, but where? If it's 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzaldehyde, structure Ph-CH2-CH2-NH2-CHO. But that's C9H11NO, which is more than our formula.

Hmm. Maybe the starting material is something like Ph-CH2-CH(NH2)-CHO. But that would be 8 C: Ph (6) + CH2 (1) + CH (1) + CHO (1) = 6+1+1+1=9? Wait, no.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with another substituent. Let's say PhNH2-CHO and another substituent. But I'm not getting it.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with an ethyl group. So, PhNH2-CH2-CH2-CHO. That would be C9H11NO, but our formula is C8. Hmm.

I'm really struggling here. Maybe I should look at the options again.

Option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. Structure would be Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, but but-3-enal is CH2=CHCH2CHO. So, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CH=CHO. But where's the hydroxyl?

Wait, no. Option D says 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. So, the but-3-enal part is CH2-CH2-CH=CHO, and the 4 position is substituted with a 4-hydroxyphenyl group. Wait, but but-3-enal is a four-carbon chain with the aldehyde on C1 and the double bond between C3 and C4. So, the structure would be OHC-CH2-CH2-CH2-PhOH. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but but-3-enal is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CHO. That's four carbons. So, the aldehyde is on C1, double bond between C2 and C3. So, but-3-enal would be CH₂-CH₂-CHO with a double bond? No, wait, nomenclature: but-3-enal is CH₂=CHCH₂CHO.

Wait, no. The correct structure for but-3-enal is CH₂=CHCH₂CHO. Because but-3-enal would have the double bond starting at carbon 3, but that's not possible as aldehydes are on carbon 1. So perhaps but-2-enal is CH₂=CHCHO. But I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe but-3-enal is CH₂CH₂CH₂CHO with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, because but has four carbons. So, but-3-enal would be CHO-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, which is impossible because the aldehyde is on C1.

Wait, perhaps but-3-enal is CH₂=CHCH₂CHO. So, the aldehyde is on C1, double bond between C2 and C3. So, structure is OHC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond between C2 and C3? No, that would be but-2-enal.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. The aldehyde is on C1, so but-3-enal would be OHC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond between C3 and C4? That can't be because but only has four carbons. So, but-3-enal can't exist because the last carbon is C4, but the double bond would be between C3 and C4, which is possible as an alkenyl group. So, but-3-enal would be OHC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂, which doesn't make sense because the double bond would be between C3 and C4, but that's beyond the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is OHC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond between C2 and C3, making it but-2-enal. So, but-3-enal doesn't make sense.

Maybe this is a red herring, and I should focus on the reaction steps.

If the starting compound after step 2 is a phenol with an aldehyde and a CH2 group, step 3 (KOH and heat) could cause elimination, forming a double bond between the aldehyde and the next carbon, creating an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde.

So, the product would have a conjugated system between the aldehyde and the double bond, which is common in elimination reactions.

Looking at the options, option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal, which would have a double bond between C3 and C4 (if but-3-enal is correctly numbered).

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde, which matches option A or D.

Wait, option A is 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal. So, that's a four-carbon chain with aldehyde on C1, double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but that would make the structure OHC-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a phenyl on C2 and C4. That doesn't make sense because but-3-enal would have the double bond between C3 and C4, but but has only four carbons. So, but-3-enal would be OHC-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, which isn't possible because that's beyond the chain.

I'm getting a bit stuck on the structures, but perhaps it's better to think about the options.

Option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. Structure would be OHC-CH2-CH2-PhOH, but but-3-enal would have the double bond between C3 and C4, which is beyond the chain. That can't be right, so perhaps the correct structure is OHC-CH2-CH=CH-PhOH, but that would be longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond between the CH2 groups, making it Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO become Ph-O-CH2-CH=CHO after elimination. Which would be but-3-enal if the chain is four carbons.

Wait, maybe the starting material after step 2 is Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO. Then, step 3 (KOH, heat) would eliminate H2O between the two CH2 groups, forming a double bond. So, Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO → Ph-O-CH2-CH=CHO. That would make the structure Ph-O-CH2-CH=CHO, which is a four-carbon chain with a double bond between C3 and C4, making it but-3-enal. So the product would be 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal, which is option D.

That makes sense. So the starting material would have been Ph-NH2-CH2-CH2-CHO, which upon diazotization and hydrolysis becomes Ph-OH-CH2-CH2-CHO. Then, elimination with KOH and heat forms Ph-O-CH2-CH=CHO, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound has the molecular formula **C₈H₉NO**, with a degree of unsaturation of 5, indicating the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and likely a double bond or carbonyl group. The **¹H-NMR data** provides the following key information:

- **9.72 ppm (t, 1H)**: A triplet, characteristic of an aldehyde proton (RCHO) coupled to two neighboring protons.
- **6.98 ppm (d, 2H)** and **6.51 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets in the aromatic region, suggesting two para-substituted benzene rings.
- **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet, possibly due to protons on a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen or hydroxyl group.
- **3.66 ppm (d, 2H)**: A doublet, likely from a CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative atom, such as oxygen.

The reaction sequence involves:

1. **NaNO₂ + HCl**: Diazotization of an aromatic amine, forming a diazonium salt.
2. **H₂O**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol.
3. **aq. KOH, Heat**: Elimination reaction, likely forming a double bond.

From the NMR data and the reaction sequence, the starting material is likely a benzaldehyde derivative with an aromatic amine group. After diazotization and hydrolysis, the amine is replaced by a hydroxyl group, forming a phenol. The final step with KOH and heat induces elimination, forming an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde.

- **Option A (2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal)**: This structure has two phenyl groups at positions 2 and 4 of a but-3-enal chain. However, the reaction sequence does not suggest the presence of two phenyl groups, and the elimination step would not produce this structure.
- **Option B (2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal)**: This structure has two 4-hydroxyphenyl groups at positions 2 and 4 of a but-2-enal chain. The reaction sequence does not support the formation of two hydroxyl groups or this specific substitution pattern.
- **Option C (3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal)**: This structure has two 4-hydroxyphenyl groups and a hydroxyl group at position 3 of a butanal chain. The reaction sequence does not support the formation of this structure, as it would require multiple hydroxyl groups introduced during the reaction.
- **Option D (4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal)**: This structure has a single 4-hydroxyphenyl group at position 4 of a but-3-enal chain. The reaction sequence aligns with this structure: the starting material is likely a benzaldehyde derivative with an aromatic amine, which undergoes diazotization, hydrolysis to form a phenol, and elimination to produce the final product.

### Conclusion:
The reaction sequence and NMR data strongly support **Option D (4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal)** as the final product.
