Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the kinetic energy of the product particles in this pion decay problem. Hmm, let's see. The reaction given is Pi(+) at rest decaying into a mu(+) and a neutrino. I think the pion is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero. 

Wait, the rest mass of the pion is 139.6 MeV/c² and the muon is 105.7 MeV/c². Oh, right, because the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the products, the muon and the neutrino, must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. 

But neutrinos are tricky because they are neutral and super light, right? So their mass can be considered negligible compared to the muon's mass. So I guess the neutrino's energy and momentum are much smaller than the muon's. 

Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is just its rest energy, which is 139.6 MeV. That energy must be shared between the muon and the neutrino. But wait, the muon will have some kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy. The neutrino's energy will be its kinetic energy because its rest mass is almost zero. 

Let me think about energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the pion's rest energy, 139.6 MeV. After decay, the muon's total energy is its rest mass plus kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy is all kinetic. 

So, E_pion = E_muon + E_neutrino. 

E_muon = m_mu * c² + K_muon. Since m_mu is 105.7 MeV, then E_muon = 105.7 + K_muon. 

E_neutrino = K_neutrino.

So 139.6 = (105.7 + K_muon) + K_neutrino.

But wait, there's also momentum conservation. The pion is at rest, so the total momentum is zero. So the muon's momentum (p_muon) must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the neutrino's momentum (p_neutrino). 

So, p_muon = -p_neutrino. But since the neutrino is so light, I think we can approximate p_neutrino ≈ E_neutrino, because for ultra-relativistic particles, E ≈ pc. 

Similarly, for the muon, since it's a heavy particle, maybe it's not ultra-relativistic, but perhaps we can get away with using E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². 

So, let's denote the muon's momentum as p. Then the neutrino's momentum is also p since they are opposite. 

So, the muon's energy E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, units can get a bit confusing. Maybe better to work in units where c=1. So E_mu² = p² + m_mu². 

Similarly, the neutrino's energy E_nu = sqrt( p² + m_nu² ). But m_nu is negligible, so E_nu ≈ p. 

So, from momentum conservation, p_mu = p_nu, because their directions are opposite, so their magnitudes are same. 

So, total energy E_total = E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6 MeV.

Let me set up the equation: sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, solving for p. Let's denote x = p. Then the equation is sqrt(x² + a²) + x = b, where a=105.7, b=139.6.

So sqrt(x² + a²) = b - x.

Square both sides: x² + a² = (b - x)^2 = b² - 2bx + x².

Simplify: a² = b² - 2bx.

So, 2bx = b² - a².

x = (b² - a²) / (2b).

Let me compute that. 

b = 139.6, a=105.7.

b² = (139.6)^2 ≈ let's calculate. 139^2 is 19321, 0.6^2 is 0.36, and cross terms 2*139*0.6 = 166.8. So 139.6^2 ≈ (139)^2 + 2*139*0.6 + (0.6)^2 = 19321 + 166.8 + 0.36 ≈ 19488.16. 

Wait, actually, 139.6 * 139.6 = (140 -0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

a² = (105.7)^2. Let's compute that. 105^2 is 11025. 0.7^2 is 0.49. 2*105*0.7 = 147. So (105.7)^2 = (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.

So b² - a² = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Then x = (8315.67) / (2 * 139.6) = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

Divide 8315 by 279.2. Hmm, 279.2 * 30 = 8376. That's a bit more than 8315. So 8315 / 279.2 ≈ 29.8.

Wait wait, 279.2 * 29.8 = let me see, 279 *30 is 8370, but since it's 29.8, 279.2 *29.8 = ?

Alternatively, 279.2 * 29.8 = 279.2*(30 -0.2) = 279.2*30 = 8376 minus 279.2*0.2=55.84. So 8376 -55.84 = 8320.16.

Which is very close to 8315.67. So our x is approximately 29.8 - wait, wait, wait. Because x is (b² - a²)/(2b) = 8315.67/(2*139.6) = 8315.67/279.2 ≈ 29.8.

Wait, but that can't be right because 8315.67 is approximately 29.8 * 279.2 (which is about 8315.36). So x is approximately 29.8. So p = x ≈29.8 MeV/c.

Wait, but the neutrino's energy E_nu is approximately p, which is 29.8 MeV. So that's the neutrino's kinetic energy? Or is it?

Wait, neutrino's energy is E_nu = p, so that's its total energy, which is all kinetic because its rest mass is zero. So K_nu = E_nu = 29.8 MeV.

Then the muon's energy E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.8)^2 + (105.7)^2 ). Let's compute that. 

29.8 squared is about 888.04 (since 30^2 is 900, 29.8 is 0.2 less, so (30-0.2)^2= 900 - 12 + 0.04=888.04). 105.7^2 is 11172.49. So sum is 888.04 + 11172.49 = 12060.53. Square root of that is sqrt(12060.53). 

Let's see, 110^2 =12100. So sqrt(12060.53) is a bit less than 110. Let me compute 109.8^2: (110-0.2)^2 = 12100 -44 + 0.04=12056.04. Hmm, 109.8^2 is 12056.04, which is just a bit under 12060.53. 

The difference is 12060.53 - 12056.04 =4.49. So 109.8^2 =12056.04. Each 0.1 increase in x adds approximately 2*109.8*0.1 + (0.1)^2 = 21.96 +0.01=21.97. 

So to reach 12060.53 from 12056.04, which is a difference of 4.49, how much delta x do we need? 

Delta x ≈ 4.49 / (2*109.8) )= 4.49 / 219.6 ≈ 0.0204. So sqrt(12060.53) ≈ 109.8 + 0.0204=109.8204 MeV.

So E_mu ≈109.82 MeV. 

But wait, E_mu = m_mu + K_mu, so K_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.82 - 105.7 =4.12 MeV. 

So the muon's kinetic energy is about 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's kinetic energy is about 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. That matches. 

So the KE of the muon is 4.12 MeV, and neutrino is 29.8 MeV. 

Wait, but the question asks for the KE of the product particles. So the products are the muon and the neutrino. So the KE of the muon is 4.12, the neutrino is 29.8. 

Looking at the options, option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's the right answer.

The problem involves the decay of a stationary pion, \( \pi^+ \), into a muon \( \mu^+ \) and a neutrino \( \nu \). The rest masses of the pion and muon are given as 139.6 MeV/c² and 105.7 MeV/c², respectively. The goal is to determine the kinetic energies (KE) of the muon and neutrino.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy before decay is the pion's rest energy, \( E_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \). After decay, the total energy is shared between the muon and neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}
   \]  
   where \( E_{\mu} = m_{\mu} c^2 + K_{\mu} \) (rest energy of the muon plus its kinetic energy) and \( E_{\nu} = K_{\nu} \) (neutrino's total energy, as its rest mass is negligible).

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   The pion is stationary, so the total momentum before decay is zero. After decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta:  
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]  
   For the muon, \( E_{\mu}^2 = p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2 \), while for the neutrino, \( E_{\nu} \approx p_{\nu} \) (since its mass is negligible).

3. **Solving for Momentum and Energy**:  
   Using the equations \( E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} \) and \( p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} \), we substitute \( E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2} \) and \( E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} \). This leads to:  
   \[
   \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p_{\mu} = 139.6.
   \]  
   Let \( x = p_{\mu} \). Squaring both sides and simplifying:  
   \[
   x = \frac{b^2 - a^2}{2b},
   \]  
   where \( b = 139.6 \) and \( a = 105.7 \). Substituting:  
   \[
   x = \frac{139.6^2 - 105.7^2}{2 \cdot 139.6}.
   \]  
   Calculating \( 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \), \( 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \), and \( b^2 - a^2 = 8315.67 \), we find:  
   \[
   x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.8 \, \text{MeV/c}.
   \]  
   Thus, \( p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} = 29.8 \, \text{MeV/c} \).

4. **Neutrino Energy**:  
   The neutrino's total energy is \( E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} = 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \), which is its kinetic energy since its rest mass is negligible.

5. **Muon Energy and Kinetic Energy**:  
   The muon's total energy is \( E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2} \). Substituting \( p_{\mu} = 29.8 \, \text{MeV/c} \) and \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV/c}^2 \):  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{29.8^2 + 105.7^2} = \sqrt{888.04 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12060.53} \approx 109.82 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   The muon's kinetic energy is:  
   \[
   K_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energy of the muon is \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \), and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \). This matches **Option D**.
