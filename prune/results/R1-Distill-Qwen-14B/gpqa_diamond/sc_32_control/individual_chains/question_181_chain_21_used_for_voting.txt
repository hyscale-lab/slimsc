Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this neutrino flux question. Hmm, let's see. The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago, and we need to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands.

Wait, first, I should remember what the pp-III branch is. I think the pp chain is one of the proton-proton fusion processes in the Sun. There are a couple of branches, like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Oh right, pp-III involves the fusion of three helium-3 nuclei into one carbon-12, right? And that process emits two protons and some neutrinos.

Wait, but neutrinos are mainly produced in the pp-I branch, which is the dominant one, isn't it? Or wait, no—no, I think the neutrinos come mostly from the CNO cycle, but wait, no, the main neutrino sources in the Sun are from the proton-proton chain, specifically the so-called pep (proton-electron-proton) and the main pp (like the pp-I and pp-III branches). Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The primary source of solar neutrinos is the fusion of protons in the pp chain, mainly the pp-I branch. The pp-I branch produces a helium-4 nucleus by two protons fusing, with a positron and a neutrino emitted. So that's the main source. The pp-III branch is a less significant part, I think.

So if the pp-III branch suddenly stops, what happens? Well, the pp-III process is responsible for producing a certain amount of neutrinos. If it stops, the neutrino flux from that process would drop. But the question is about the ratio of two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2).

Wait, neutrino energies from the Sun are usually in the MeV range, but I might be mixing up the exact energy ranges. So, the main neutrinos from the pp chain have energies around 500 keV to a few MeV. Each branch produces neutrinos at different energies. So the pp-I branch, which is the dominant one, emits neutrinos with energies around a few hundred keV to about 1 MeV. The pp-III branch emits higher-energy neutrinos, perhaps around a few MeV?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to remember. The pp-I branch produces neutrinos of about 0.4 MeV (so 400 keV) and up, but I'm not sure about the exact distribution. The pp-III branch, on the other hand, produces higher-energy neutrinos because it involves more mass. So if pp-III is suddenly stopped, the neutrinos from that branch would stop, affecting higher energy bands more.

So, the problem states that the pp-III branch stops, so the neutrinos from that process stop. Let's think about the flux in two bands. Band 1 is 700-800 keV, and band 2 is 800-900 keV.

Assuming that the pp-III neutrinos are more in the higher energy range, stopping them would reduce the flux in higher bands more than lower ones. But wait, what's the contribution of pp-III to these bands?

Wait, I think that the main neutrino production is from the pe-p (proton-electron-proton) reaction, which is part of the pp-I branch. The pp-III branch produces a smaller number of neutrinos but at higher energies. So, if the pp-III stops, the high-energy neutrinos (like those in band 2, 800-900 keV) would be affected more. So their flux would drop, but the lower band (700-800 keV) would be less affected.

Alternatively, maybe band 1 is lower than the main pp neutrino energies, so if pp-III produced higher energy neutrinos, then stopping pp-III would mean that the higher band (band 2) would have less flux. So the flux in band 2 would be lower than band 1.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of flux band 1 to band 2. If band 2's flux decreases more, the ratio (1/2) would increase. Or wait, no—because the pp-III process contributes to band 2 more. So if pp-III stops, band 2's flux would be lower than before, but band 1's flux remains the same (assuming other processes aren't affected). So the ratio would be band1/band2. If band2 is lower, then the ratio increases.

Wait, but I'm not considering whether the other branches are still active. The question says all other reactions remained as they were. So other neutrino production continues. So the pp-I and other branches are still running. So, the main neutrino sources (pp-I and CNO cycle) are still producing neutrinos, but the pp-III's neutrinos are gone.

So, I need to figure out what fraction of the neutrinos in each band come from pp-III.

Assuming that the majority of the neutrinos in the higher band (800-900) come from pp-III, and the lower band (700-800) comes more from pp-I. So when pp-III stops, the higher band's flux would drop significantly, while the lower band's flux remains roughly the same.

So, the flux in band 1 (700-800) is less affected, and band 2 (800-900) is more affected. So, the ratio (band1 / band2) would increase. Because band2's flux goes down, so the ratio becomes higher than before.

But what's the original ratio when pp-III is active? Let's think about the neutrino spectrum. The main neutrinos from the pp chain have a distribution that peaks around a few hundred keV, and the flux decreases at higher energies. So, the number of neutrinos at higher energies is less. Wait, but if pp-III is a minor source but emits higher-energy neutrinos, then without pp-III, the high-energy tail would drop.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the relative contributions. Let's imagine that without the pp-III, the flux in band 2 (800-900) drops by some factor compared to the flux in band 1.

If the pp-III contributes a certain fraction to each band, when it stops, that fraction is subtracted.

Alternatively, perhaps the majority of the neutrinos in band 1 and band 2 come from the dominant pp-I branch, and pp-III contributes a small fraction. So, if we remove the pp-III contribution, the change in the flux would be small in band 1 but significant in band 2.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of the two bands after pp-III stops.

Let me think of it as the flux in each band being the sum of contributions from different processes. So, flux_band = flux_ppI + flux_ppII + flux_ppIII + ... 

In the scenario, flux_ppIII becomes zero. So, for each band, the new flux is without pp-III.

Assume that the pp-III contributes mainly to the higher band (band 2). So, without pp-III, the flux in band 2 would be lower than band 1.

But what's the original flux ratio before stopping?

Wait, the original solar neutrino flux peaks around a few hundred keV and then tails off. So, the flux decreases with increasing energy. So, higher energy bands have lower flux.

But if the pp-III contributes more to higher energies than the pp-I, then when we stop pp-III, the higher energies would have a larger relative drop.

But the question is the ratio of the fluxes in the two bands after the pp-III stops. So, the flux in band 1 (700-800) may have a certain fraction from pp-III, and the same for band 2.

Wait, perhaps without the pp-III, the flux in band 2 is reduced significantly compared to band 1. Let's say that before the pp-III stopped, both bands had some contributions. Now, when it stops, band 2's flux drops, so the ratio (1/2) increases.

Wait, let me think numerically. Let's say prior to stopping, the flux in band 1 was F1, and in band 2 was F2.

Assume that F1 = a * (ppI_contribution) + b * (ppIII_contribution)
Similarly, F2 = c * (ppI_contribution) + d * (ppIII_contribution)

But without knowing the exact values, perhaps we can reason based on the energy dependence.

The pp-III neutrinos are higher energy. So, in band 2 (800-900), a larger fraction comes from pp-III than in band 1.

So, after stopping pp-III, the flux in band 2 becomes F2' = c * (ppI) + d*0. So F2' is lower than F2.

But for band 1, F1' remains a*ppI + b*ppIII, but if the ppIII contribution is lower, maybe the change is less.

Wait, but if the ppIII contributes a small amount to band 1, then the flux in band 1 doesn't change much, while band 2's flux drops by a lot.

So, the ratio F1/F2 would increase.

But I'm not sure by how much. The options are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1.

Wait, the options are A) 10, B) 0.01, C) 1, D) 0.1.

So, if the ratio increases, the answer would be greater than 1, so either A or C.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think again. If the pp-III process is stopped, the high-energy neutrinos (band 2) would have a lower flux because they lose a significant portion of their source. The lower band (band 1) would be less affected, as their main source is pp-I.

So, the flux in band 2 would drop, making the ratio (F1/F2) larger than before. Suppose initially, before stopping, F1 and F2 were similar. Now, if F2 drops by a factor of 10, then the ratio would be 10 times higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III process contributes about 10% of the neutrinos in band 1, and 90% in band 2, making the ratio 1/9 initially. But when pp-III stops, F1 drops by 10%, F2 drops by 90%. So F1 is 0.9F1_old, F2 is 0.1F2_old.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio after the stopping, so the ratio becomes (0.9F1_old)/(0.1 F2_old) =9*(F1_old/F2_old).

Wait, but I'm making this up, so without knowing the exact contributions, it's hard.

But, thinking about the Sun's neutrino spectrum. The main neutrinos from the pp chain peak around 0.4 MeV (400 keV), with flux decreasing with higher energy. So, higher energy bands have lower flux.

But the pp-III process emits higher-energy neutrinos. So, without pp-III, the high energy bands would be lower than the expected.

In our case, band 1 is 700-800 keV and band 2 is 800-900 keV. So, the neutrino flux in band 2 is lower than in band 1 under normal circumstances because it's higher energy.

But if pp-III is a significant source of neutrinos in band 2, then when it stops, the flux in band 2 would drop, making the ratio F1/F2 higher.

Alternatively, without knowing the exact numbers, perhaps the ratio is about 1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: when the pp-III branch stops, the neutrino flux in the higher energies (like band 2) is reduced more than in the lower band. So, the ratio of F1/F2 increases. So, if the original ratio was 1, then perhaps after stopping, the ratio becomes 10.

But wait, that would make the answer A) 10.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio is 1, meaning that the fluxes are similar. But I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps another angle. The neutrino spectrum from the pp-III process has a different energy distribution. For example, the main pp-I produces neutrinos in the 0.4-1 MeV range, while pp-III produces higher, say 2-4 MeV. So, in the 700-800 and 800-900 keV bands, which are about 0.7-0.8 and 0.8-0.9 MeV, the contribution from pp-III may be minimal. So stopping pp-III would have a negligible effect on these bands. That can't be, because the question states that this is a significant enough change to affect the ratio.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some crucial point. The pp-III process emits neutrinos as part of the three-body fusion of helium-3. The neutrino energies from this process are typically higher, around 2.5 MeV or so. So, in the problem, the two bands are below that. So, the neutrinos from pp-III at around 2.5 MeV would not be present in the 700-800 or 800-900 keV bands. So, stopping pp-III wouldn't affect these two bands.

Wait, that can't be right because the question is about the ratio of these bands when pp-III stops. So maybe the initial assumption is incorrect. Maybe the pp-III neutrinos contribute to these lower energy bands.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from pp-III have energies within the 0.5-1 MeV range, so stopping them would affect the lower bands more. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are emitted at about 1.4 MeV. So, the 700-800 keV band is below that, and 800-900 is also below that. So, the pp-III neutrinos are not present in these bands. So, stopping pp-III would not affect these fluxes. That would mean the ratio remains the same, so 1. So, the answer would be C) 1.

But that doesn't make sense because the question is about the ratio changing. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the neutrino energies. Let me recall: the main neutrinos from the Sun are the Electron neutrinos, right? The pp chain produces neutrinos via the pep reaction (which has ~0.4 MeV) and the main pp (about 1.4 MeV?), but I'm not certain.

Wait, no, the main pp fusion produces a helium-4 and emits a positron and a neutrino. The energy of the neutrino is approximately the mass difference. So, the mass difference for the proton and helium-4 is about 0.4 MeV, so the neutrino energy is about 0.4 MeV. But wait, that's the main pp process, which is the dominant one.

The pp-III branch involves three He-3 nuclei fusing into a C-12, which then emits two protons and two neutrinos. Each neutrino would carry away about 0.4 MeV, but I'm not sure. Or maybe each pair of neutrinos takes some energy. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III process produces higher-energy neutrinos.

Wait, perhaps each neutrino in the pp-III process has an energy around ~2.5 MeV, but I'm not exactly certain. But if that's the case, then the neutrinos from pp-III are at higher energies than the bands in question (700-800 and 800-900 keV, which are 0.7-0.9 MeV). So, the flux in these bands would not be affected by stopping the pp-III process because the pp-III neutrinos are at higher energies. Therefore, the flux ratio remains unchanged, and the answer would be C) 1.

But the question implies that the flux ratio does change, so this must not be the case. So, perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Another possibility: perhaps the neutrinos from the pp-III process have a broad spectrum, with some in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range. So, if we stop the pp-III process, the flux in both bands would decrease. But how does the flux in band 1 compare to band 2?

If the pp-III process contributes more to higher energies, then band 2 would lose a larger fraction of its flux than band 1. So, the ratio F1/F2 would increase.

But without knowing the exact contributions, it's tricky. However, perhaps the main source of neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band is pp-I, and the 800-900 keV is a mix of pp-I and pp-III.

In that case, when pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 would drop more than in band 1, making the ratio F1/F2 higher.

But I'm not sure how much higher.

Wait, let me think of an example. Suppose the original flux in band 1 is 100 neutrinos per second, and band 2 is 90. So F1/F2 would be 100/90≈1.11.

But if pp-III contributes, say, 10% to band 1 (so F1 becomes 90), and 90% to band 2 (so F2 becomes 9). Then, F1/F2 becomes 90/9=10. So the ratio would be 10.

That's option A.

So, if the pp-III contributes significantly more to band 2 than to band 1, stopping it would cause band 2's flux to drop more, leading to a higher F1/F2 ratio.

So, in this case, the ratio would be approximately 10.

Alternatively, maybe the contributions are such that without pp-III, the ratio is 10.

Therefore, the answer would be A) 10.

The question involves determining the ratio of neutrino flux between two energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) after the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops. The pp-III branch is a less significant but higher-energy neutrino production process compared to the dominant pp-I branch. Neutrinos from the pp-III branch are emitted at higher energies, typically around 2.5 MeV, but their spectrum may also extend into the lower energy bands (e.g., 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV). 

When the pp-III branch stops, the flux in the higher-energy bands (like 800-900 keV) is expected to decrease more significantly than in the lower-energy bands (700-800 keV), as the pp-III process contributes a larger fraction of neutrinos to higher energies. This would result in an increase in the ratio of flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) to flux in band 2 (800-900 keV).

Assuming that the pp-III process contributes a small fraction to band 1 and a larger fraction to band 2, the flux in band 2 would drop more significantly after the pp-III branch stops. For example, if the original flux ratio was close to 1, the removal of the pp-III contribution could increase the ratio to approximately 10. This aligns with the reasoning that the flux in band 2 is more affected than in band 1, leading to a higher ratio of flux in band 1 to flux in band 2.

Thus, the approximate ratio of the flux between the two bands after the pp-III branch stops is **10**.
