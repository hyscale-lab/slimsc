Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let's read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that behaves according to a specific wave function. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. The i here is the imaginary unit, right? The problem states that when measuring the position of the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So, I'm guessing that the wave function is zero outside this region, but I need to think about the conditions that make that happen.

Wait, but the wave function is given in a part of space where the particles can exist. So, maybe the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But the way the question is phrased, the wave function is described as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i in the region where the particle can exist. Hmm, perhaps I should consider normalization.

In quantum mechanics, the probability of finding a particle in a region is determined by the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function. Since all particles are found between x=1 and x=3, the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 must equal 1. So, I think I need to normalize the wave function to find the value of 'a'.

Let me write down the wave function: ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i. Wait, but wave functions can have both real and imaginary parts. However, when calculating the probability density, we take the absolute square, which is ψ*(x) * ψ(x). 

So, the absolute square would be |ψ(x)|² = [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i ] * [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i ] because the conjugate of -0.5i is +0.5i.

Multiplying these terms: (a/(sqrt(1+x)))² + (0.5)^2. Because when you multiply (a - ib)(a + ib) = a² + b².

So, |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, wait a minute. The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Oh, but wait, is this the entire wave function? Or is it a part of it? Because in the region where the particle exists (x between 1 and 3), the wave function is non-zero, and zero elsewhere. So the normalization integral is from 1 to 3.

So the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 must equal 1.

So, let's compute the integral:

Integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Wait, but wait again. If that's the case, the integral would have two parts. Let me split it into two terms.

Integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx = a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3.

And the integral of 0.25 dx is 0.25*(3 -1) = 0.5.

So, putting it together:

a² * [ln(4) - ln(2)] + 0.5 = 1.

Wait, ln(4) is ln(2^2) = 2 ln(2), so ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2). So:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that: ln(2) is approximately 0.6931. So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.72. Then a² ≈ 0.72, so a ≈ sqrt(0.72) = approx 0.8485.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is very close. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I correctly set up the integral? Because the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. However, for the wave function to be a valid solution, it must satisfy the Schrodinger equation and boundary conditions. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating, because the problem says that the wave function is given as such in the region where the particle exists, and zero elsewhere. So normalization is the way to go here.

Wait another thing. The wave function is complex, but when we compute the probability density, we have to take the modulus squared. So yes, as I did before.

So the calculation was correct, leading to a ≈ 0.8485, which rounds to 0.85, so option B.

To solve the problem, we need to normalize the given wave function:

The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is proportional to the absolute square of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is only found between \(x=1\) and \(x=3\), the integral of \(|\psi(x)|^2\) over this interval must equal 1 (normalization condition):

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. **First term**:  
\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3 = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right)
\]

Using the property \(\ln(4) = 2\ln(2)\), this simplifies to:

\[
a^2 \ln(2)
\]

2. **Second term**:  
\[
\int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 (3-1) = 0.5
\]

Combining both terms, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Subtracting 0.5 from both sides:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.72
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.72} \approx 0.8485
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, \(a \approx 0.85\). Comparing this result with the given options, the closest match is:

**A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6**

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
