Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star affect the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Right, I remember that stars can have sunspots which are cooler regions on their surfaces, and these spots affect the overall temperature measurements.

The star in question has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that work? Because spots are cooler, so the star appears dimmer. But the overall Teff is calculated based on the total luminosity, right?

The main part of the question deals with the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å, which I think is in the near-ultraviolet or maybe visible range. Since the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), I can use the Boltzmann equation for this.

The Boltzmann equation relates the population of two energy levels. The ratio N1/N2 is equal to (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower. So the temperature used in the Boltzmann equation would be lower, right? But wait, does the presence of spots affect the temperature of the photosphere where the Ti atoms are? Or is the Teff measured as an average, but the photosphere is still at a higher temperature where the atoms are?

Actually, the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because the spots are cooler regions, so the average Teff of the whole star goes down. But the photosphere's temperature in each region (spot or not) might be different. But in this problem, the question is about the photosphere, so maybe the temperature of the photosphere is considered the same everywhere (but when spots are present, the overall average is lower, which I guess affects the emission...). Hmm, wait, the problem states that when spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So, perhaps the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K when spots are present. But in reality, the spots themselves are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. But the problem simplifies it to an average.

Wait, maybe the effective temperature given is the average, but the actual photosphere in the unspotted regions is still at 6000 K. But the presence of spots might affect the overall flux. Alternatively, perhaps the entire photosphere is being considered as a mixture of spotted and unspotted regions, with an average temperature of 5500 K. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, the problem says when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So, perhaps the effective temperature is the average considering the spots. So, the star's total luminosity is lower because 40% of its surface is cooler. But the photosphere in the unspotted regions is 6000 K, and the spots are some lower temperature, but the problem is giving the effective temperature as 5500 K.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The problem states that when the star has 40% of its surface covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps from the observer's point of view, the star's Teff is 5500 K. But how does this relate to the photospheric temperature where the Ti atoms are? Because Ti is in the photosphere, which could be at the 6000 K when there are no spots, but when spots are present, perhaps the temperature of the photosphere (in unspotted regions) remains the same, but the spots are cooler. Wait, but the problem says that the photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. Hmm, maybe the presence of spots lowers the effective temperature because spots are cooler, but the actual photosphere in the unspotted regions is at 6000 K. So, the temperature used in the Boltzmann equation would be 6000 K in both cases, because the Ti atoms are in the unspotted photosphere. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the overall Teff is lower.

I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to clarify. When the star has spots, the average Teff is 5500 K. But the Ti atoms are in the photosphere. Does this mean that the effective temperature of the photosphere itself is 5500 K when spots are present? Or does it mean that the photosphere's unspotted regions are still 6000 K, and the spots are at a lower temperature, say, T_spot, such that the average is 5500 K. Because the star's total flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted and spotted regions.

Wait, maybe I should model the flux. The star's total flux (as seen by the observer) would be a combination of the flux from the unspotted regions and the spotted regions. The effective temperature is the temperature of a blackbody that would produce the same total flux as the star. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature is lower.

But in reality, the unspotted regions have Teff of 6000 K, and the spots have a lower Teff, say Ts. The effective temperature of the whole star is then computed based on the total emitted flux. Let me think about the formula for the effective temperature when part of the surface is at a different temperature.

The star's total luminosity is the sum of the luminosity from the unspotted and spotted regions. The luminosity of a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR² σ T^4. So, let's say the star has radius R. Without spots, L = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, which have temperature Ts. So the unspotted area is 60% of the surface: 0.6 * 4π R². The spotted area is 0.4 * 4π R².

The total luminosity would be L_total = 0.6 * 4π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 * 4π R² σ (Ts)^4.

The effective temperature T_eff is given by the condition that L_total = 4π R² σ T_eff^4.

So setting up the equation:

0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(Ts)^4 = (5500)^4.

Wait, but wait, that would be the case if the entire star's surface were at T_eff. But no, I think I need to write the equation correctly.

Wait, let me write it mathematically. The total luminosity is:

L_total = (Area_unspotted) * sigma * T_unspotted^4 + (Area_spotted) * sigma * T_spotted^4.

But Area_unspotted = 0.6 * 4π R², and Area_spotted = 0.4 * 4π R².

So L_total = 4π R² [0.6 T_unspotted^4 + 0.4 T_spotted^4 ].

The effective temperature is T_eff, so L_total = 4π R² sigma T_eff^4.

Dividing both sides by 4π R² sigma, we get:

[0.6 T_unspotted^4 + 0.4 T_spotted^4] = T_eff^4.

In the problem, when there are spots, T_eff is 5500 K. The unspotted regions are at 6000 K. So substituting:

0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(Ts)^4 = (5500)^4.

We can solve this equation for Ts. Because the spots are cooler than the unspotted regions, Ts must be less than 6000 K.

But wait, do I need to find Ts? Because the problem mentions the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. Hmm, perhaps the question is more about the change in the ratio N1/N2 when the star has spots, implying that the temperature used in the Boltzmann equation is changing.

Wait, but the Ti atoms are in the photosphere. If the star's overall Teff is 5500 K when 40% of the surface is spotted, but the unspotted regions are still at 6000 K, then the photosphere in those regions would be at 6000 K. So the temperature of the Ti atoms is 6000 K. But when the star has spots, perhaps the observed average temperature is lower, but the actual photosphere in the unspotted regions is still 6000 K. So the temperature T in the Boltzmann equation remains 6000 K. But wait, the question says when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is considered to be at 5500 K when spots are present, which would mean the Ti atoms are at 5500 K when the star is spotted. But that would contradict the fact that the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere.

This is a bit confusing. But according to the problem statement, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K in that case. So the Ti atoms are in a region where the effective temperature is 5500 K. So during the spotted case, T = 5500 K, and during the unspotted case, T = 6000 K.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. Maybe the effective temperature refers to the star's overall emission, but the photosphere itself in the unspotted regions is still 6000 K. Hmm, perhaps the question is simplifying things, and when the star has spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K, so the photosphere is assumed to be at 5500 K. That might be the case, so perhaps I should proceed under that assumption.

So, the ratio N1/N2 is given by (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). So when the star has spots, T is 5500 K, and when it doesn't, T is 6000 K.

The factor by which the ratio changes is (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_with_spots.

Which is [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) ) ) ].

The g1/g2 factors cancel out, so the factor is exp( [ -ΔE/(k*6000) + ΔE/(k*5500) ] )

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(5500) - 1/(6000) ] )

Wait, wait, because it's [ - (1/6000) + (1/5500) ].

Which is (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(5500 *6000) ) = 500/(33,000,000) ) = 1/(66,000).

So the exponent becomes (ΔE/(k)) * (1/66,000).

But wait, I don't know ΔE. The transition corresponds to a wavelength λ of 1448 Å. The energy difference between the two levels can be found using the photon energy equation: ΔE = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant, c speed of light. So let's compute ΔE.

But since we're dealing with the exponent, which is (ΔE)/(k T), but wait, let's compute it in terms of units.

Wait, let me compute (ΔE)/(k) * (1/66,000) ) ?

Wait, let's compute the exponent step by step.

Compute ΔE/(k) = (h c)/(λ k).

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.
c = 3e8 m/s.
λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.
k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10 m * 1.38e-23 )
= (1.9878e-25) / (1448e-33 * 1.38e-23)
Wait, wait, let me compute the denominator: 1448e-10 m * 1.38e-23 J/K.

Wait, 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 2.006e-30 J·m/K.

So numerator is 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (2.006e-30 J·m/K ) ) 

= (1.9878e-25) / (2.006e-30) ) K

= approx (2e-25)/(2e-30) ) = 1e5 K.

Wait, more accurately,

1.9878e-25 / 2.006e-30 ≈ (1.9878 / 2.006) * 1e5 ≈ approx 0.99 * 1e5 = ~99000 K.

So ΔE/(k) ≈ 99000 K.

Now, the exponent in the factor is [ (ΔE/(k) ) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ) ].

We computed 1/5500 -1/6000 = 1/(66,000).

So the exponent is 99000 K * (1/66000) ) = 99000 / 66000 = 1.5.

So the factor is exp(1.5) ≈ 4.4817.

Wait, what's exp(1.5)? Let me compute.

e^1.5 is e^1 * e^0.5 ≈ 2.718 * 1.6487≈ 4.4817.

So the factor is approximately 4.48, which is about 4.5. Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

Wait, but wait a minute. Because when the star has spots, the temperature is 5500 K, so the exponents are negative.

Wait, let me double-check the factor.

The ratio when no spots (N1/N2)_no_spots is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T_no_spots) )

When there are spots, it's exp( -ΔE/(k T_spots) )

So the factor is [ exp( -ΔE/(k T_no_spots) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T_spots) ) ]

Which is exp( [ -ΔE/(k T_no_spots) + ΔE/(k T_spots) ] )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T_spots) - 1/(T_no_spots) ] )

Ah, I think I made a mistake earlier in the sign. Because it's [ (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots) ].

In the previous calculation, I had 1/5500 -1/6000, which is positive because 1/5500 is larger than 1/6000.

So the exponent is positive, so the factor is exp( positive ), so the ratio (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_with_spots is exp(1.5) ≈4.48.

Which is option C (~4.5).

But wait, let me think about this. Because the ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(kT) ).

So when T increases (from 5500 to 6000), ΔE/(kT) becomes smaller (since T is in the denominator), so exp(-x) becomes larger. So N1/N2 increases with T.

When the star has spots, T is lower (5500 K), so N1/N2 decreases.

The question says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which aligns with this.

So the factor is (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_with_spots = exp(1.5) ≈4.48, so the factor is about 4.5. So option C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels using the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{N_1}{N_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the two levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{N_1}{N_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{N_1}{N_2}\right)_{\text{with spots}}}.
\]

### Step 1: Simplify the factor
The statistical weights \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) cancel out, leaving:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_{\text{no spots}}} + \frac{\Delta E}{k T_{\text{with spots}}}\right).
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{with spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 2: Compute \(\Delta E\)
The energy difference \(\Delta E\) corresponds to the transition wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\). Using the photon energy equation:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) (Planck's constant), \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\) (speed of light), and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.448 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

To express \(\Delta E\) in terms of \(k\), we use \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.448 \times 10^{-19}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 105,000 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the exponent
The temperatures are \(T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K}\) and \(T_{\text{with spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K}\). The term in the exponent is:

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{with spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}.
\]

Calculating:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx \frac{1}{66,000}.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{with spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right) = (105,000) \times \left(\frac{1}{66,000}\right) \approx 1.58.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the factor
The factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.58) \approx 4.85.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The closest option to \(4.85\) is \(4.5\), which corresponds to **Option C**.

### Final Answer:
The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately \(4.5\).
