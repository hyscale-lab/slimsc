Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we have a solution with 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2- or PO4^3-?) in the solution. The temperatures are at 25°C, and we're given the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Hmm, so I remember that H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons. The different Ka values tell us about the strength of each deprotonation step. So, the first dissociation is the strongest, the second weaker, and the third is very weak.

The problem involves two salts: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me think about what each of these salts dissociates into.

KH2PO4 (potassium dihydrogen phosphate) dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So, the H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When it dissolves, it should give Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So, that's the hydrogen phosphate ion.

Wait, but when these salts are in solution together, they can form a buffer solution because H2PO4^- can act as an acid (losing a proton to become HPO4^2-) and HPO4^2- can act as a base (gaining a proton to become H2PO4^-). This is because H2PO4^- is the acid form and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base.

So, the pH of the solution will depend on this buffer system. Since both are present, I think I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is useful for buffer solutions, and it's given by:

pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right? Or wait, sometimes people refer to PO4^3- as orthophosphate, but in this context, I think HPO4^2- is the ion in question here because that's what's present in the solution.

So, I need to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution.

Wait, no. Wait. Let me get this straight. The solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, when each dissociates, the solution will have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. So, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to HPO4^2-.

So, the plan is:

1. Calculate the moles of each salt.
2. Since the solution volume is given, find the concentrations in mol/L.
3. Use the buffer equation to find the pH.
4. Then, perhaps use that pH to find the ratio of HPO4^2- to H2PO4^-.
5. But wait, since we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation applies to their ratio.

Wait, no, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation uses the second dissociation, since we're dealing with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, H3PO4 has three dissociations. The first is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1=7.5e-3). The second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2=6.2e-8). The third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3=1.8e-12).

So, when we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, the relevant pKa is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) ≈ 7.21 (since 6.2e-8 is 6.2 x10^-8, so pKa is about 7.21? Let me double-check: log(6.2)= ~0.79, so log(6.2e-8) = 0.79 -8 = -7.21, so pKa is 7.21.

Wait, wait, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8) which is about 7.21. Right.

So, applying the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

But wait, the problem gives us the amounts of each salt. So, the moles of H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4·2H2O) will determine the concentrations.

So, first, let's calculate the moles of each.

Moles of KH2PO4 = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00734 mol.
Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.00561 mol.

Wait, wait, let me compute that:

For KH2PO4:
Molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. So 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.00734 mol.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O:
Molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.00561 mol.

Since the volume is 0.2 liters, the concentration of each ion is (moles) / 0.2.

So, [H2PO4^-] = 0.00734 / 0.2 = 0.0367 M.
[HPO4^2-] = 0.00561 / 0.2 = 0.02805 M.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Plugging in the numbers:

pH = 7.21 + log(0.02805 / 0.0367)

Let me compute 0.02805 / 0.0367. That's approximately 0.765.

log(0.765) is about -0.115.

So pH ≈ 7.21 - 0.115 = 7.095.

Wait, but the problem isn't asking for pH, it's asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I'm assuming is HPO4^2-.

Wait, but in the solution, the amount of HPO4^2- is determined by the buffer system. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of both salts affects the concentration via the pH. Or maybe not, because the amounts are fixed by the moles.

Wait, no. Wait a minute, the initial concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are 0.0367 M and 0.02805 M, respectively, but the pH will affect the ratio between these two. However, in this case, since both are present, the buffer equation will hold, and the ratio of [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is determined by the pH and pKa2.

Wait, but since we have both the acid and the base in the solution, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation relates the pH to the ratio of [base]/[acid].

So, once we calculate the pH, we can find the ratio, but wait, in this case, we can also calculate the exact concentrations because the solution is at equilibrium.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- present, so it's a buffer. But the question is, what's the concentration of HPO4^2-?

Wait, but the initial concentrations are based on the moles of each salt. So, without considering any hydrolysis or reaction, the concentration of HPO4^2- would be 0.02805 M. But considering the buffer, the pH would adjust, and some H2PO4^- might deprotonate into HPO4^2-, or vice versa.

Wait, that's where the buffer equation comes in. The ratio of [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] equals 10^(pH - pKa2), which is (because Ka2 is 6.2e-8, pKa2 is ~7.21).

Wait, but I'm not sure if the initial concentrations are exact, or if the solution's pH will cause some conversion between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, no. Wait, in reality, the solution will reach an equilibrium where some of the H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, depending on the pH. But since the solution is buffered by both ions, the pH is determined by their ratio.

So the initial concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are 0.0367 M and 0.02805 M, respectively. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation tells us that pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

So, plugging in the numbers, as I did earlier, pH is approximately 7.21 + log(0.02805/0.0367) = 7.21 + log(0.765) ≈ 7.21 -0.115 ≈ 7.095.

Wait, but if the pH is 7.095, which is less than pKa2 (7.21), that suggests that the [base]/[acid] ratio is less than 1, which matches with our ratio of 0.765.

But how does this affect the actual concentrations of HPO4^2-?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since the solution is a buffer, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will remain as they are, because they are in significant excess compared to the H+ or OH- ions. So, the actual concentrations are the initial ones: [HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M, [H2PO4^-] = 0.0367 M.

Wait, but that can't be right because the presence of the buffer will affect the degree of ionization. Or maybe in this case, the concentrations are fixed by the amounts of the salts and don't change significantly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- ions, which is the moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O divided by the volume.

Wait, but that would make the answer 0.02805 M, which is 2.805e-2 M. But looking at the options, the highest option is 6.24e-7, which is much smaller. So that can't be right. Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe the problem is more complicated. Perhaps the HPO4^2- can undergo further deprotonation, but given the Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small, so the concentration of PO4^3- would be minimal. But the problem is about orthophosphate, which I'm a bit confused about. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, isn't it? Or is HPO4^2- also called orthophosphate sometimes?

Wait, wait, I think I might have mixed up the terms. Let me clarify:

- H3PO4 is phosphoric acid.
- H2PO4^- is dihydrogen phosphate.
- HPO4^2- is hydrogen phosphate (or sometimes called orthophosphate?).
- PO4^3- is called phosphate ion or orthophosphate.

Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. I think the term "orthophosphate" refers to the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-. So, in this problem, when it asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, it's actually PO4^3-.

Ah, that makes a big difference. So, I need to find [PO4^3-] in the solution.

But wait, in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the two salts. So, in this solution, the phosphate can be in any of its forms, but the majority would be in H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because the pH is around 7.1, which is between pKa2 and pKa3.

Wait, because Ka2 is ~6.2e-8 (pKa2 ~7.21) and Ka3 is ~1.8e-12 (pKa3 ~11.74). So, at pH 7.1, which is less than pKa2, the dominant species would be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. But since the pH is 7.1, which is lower than pKa2 (7.21), the solution is slightly acidic relative to pKa2, so H2PO4^- is more prevalent than HPO4^2-.

But the question is about the concentration of PO4^3-, which is the fully deprotonated form. Since Ka3 is so small, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low.

So, to find [PO4^3-], we can consider the third dissociation step: HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so the expression is:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange to solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

But what is [H+] in the solution?

Earlier, I calculated the pH as approximately 7.095. So, [H+] = 10^(-pH) ≈ 10^(-7.095) ≈ 8.2e-8 M.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, let's get pH more accurately. Let's re-calculate pH.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M
[H2PO4^-] = 0.0367 M

Their ratio is 0.02805 / 0.0367 = approximately 0.765.

So, log(0.765) is about -0.115.

So, pH = pKa2 + (-0.115) = 7.21 - 0.115 ≈ 7.095.

So, [H+] = 10^(-7.095) ≈ 8.2e-8 M.

Now, plug into the equation for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.2e-8)

Let me compute the numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = approx 5.049e-14.

Then, divide by 8.2e-8: 5.049e-14 / 8.2e-8 = approx 6.157e-7 M.

Wait, that's about 6.16e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M. Close enough, considering possible rounding errors in the calculations.

Wait, but let me check the calculations more precisely.

First, calculate [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-]:

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007340 mol.

Molarity = 0.007340 / 0.2 = 0.0367 M.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005608 mol.

Molarity = 0.005608 / 0.2 = 0.02804 M.

Ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02804 / 0.0367 ≈ 0.7649.

log(0.7649) = approximately -0.115.

So pH = 7.21 - 0.115 = 7.095.

[H+] = 10^(-7.095) ≈ 8.24e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Plugging in:

(1.8e-12) * 0.02804 = 5.0472e-14.

Divide by 8.24e-8: 5.0472e-14 / 8.24e-8 = ?

Let me compute that:

5.0472e-14 / 8.24e-8 = (5.0472 / 8.24) * 1e-6.

5.0472 / 8.24 ≈ 0.612.

So, 0.612e-6 = 6.12e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M. That's very close.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the pH calculation.

Let me calculate the pH more accurately.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02804 M.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.0367 M.

Ratio = 0.02804 / 0.0367 = 0.7649.

log(0.7649) is more precisely:

Log(0.7649) = log(7.649e-1) = log(7.649) -1.

Log(7.649) is approximately 0.8844.

So, log(0.7649) = 0.8844 -1 = -0.1156.

So, pH = 7.21 - 0.1156 = 7.0944.

So, [H+] = 10^(-7.0944) ≈ 8.204e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02804) / (8.204e-8).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02804 = 5.0472e-14.

Denominator: 8.204e-8.

So, 5.0472e-14 / 8.204e-8 = (5.0472 / 8.204) * 1e-6.

5.0472 / 8.204 ≈ 0.6153.

So, 0.6153e-6 = 6.153e-7 M.

Rounding to three significant figures, it's 6.15e-7 M. The closest option is A) 6.24e-7 M. Hmm, but perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that [HPO4^2-] is 0.02804 M is incorrect because the solution may have some HPO4^2- from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but considering that H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and vice versa, but when we have a buffer solution, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in a certain ratio based on the pH and pKa2.

Wait, but the initial concentrations are determined by the moles of the salts, but in solution, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is determined by the buffer equation. So, perhaps the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are not exactly 0.0367 M and 0.02804 M, but adjusted based on the pH.

Wait, but I think that's the point — the buffer equation allows you to find the actual concentrations. Because the solution can't have more HPO4^2- than what's provided by the salts, but the buffer equation takes into account the pH and the ratio.

Wait, but the initial concentrations are the actual concentrations because the buffer system will not change them significantly. Because the buffer resists changes in pH, but the concentrations are set by the amounts of the salts. So perhaps the initial approach is correct, and the [PO4^3-] is approximately 6.15e-7 M.

But the option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is very close. So, perhaps due to more precise calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact value.

Let me re-calculate [H+]:

pH = 7.0944 → [H+] = 10^(-7.0944) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0944) ≈ 1e-7 * 0.8204 = 8.204e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02804) / (8.204e-8) = (5.0472e-14) / (8.204e-8) = (5.0472 / 8.204) * 1e-6.

5.0472 / 8.204 = approximately 0.6153.

So, 0.6153e-6 = 6.153e-7 M.

Hmm. The options don't have this exact value. The closest option is A) 6.24e-7.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me double-check the moles.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: molar mass is 177.99 g/mol.

1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = approx 0.005608 mol. That's 5.608e-3 mol.

In 0.2 L, concentration is 5.608e-3 / 0.2 = 0.02804 M. Correct.

KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 7.34e-3 mol. 7.34e-3 / 0.2 = 0.0367 M. Correct.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = 7.21 + log(0.02804/0.0367) → 7.21 + log(0.7649) → 7.21 -0.1156 → 7.0944.

[H+] = 8.204e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02804) / (8.204e-8) = (5.0472e-14) / (8.204e-8) = 6.153e-7 M.

Hmm, so why is option A 6.24e-7? Maybe I should carry more decimal places in the calculations.

Let me compute log(0.7649) more accurately.

log(0.7649) = log(7.649 * 10^-1) = log(7.649) -1.

log(7.649): Using a calculator, log(7) is 0.8451, log(7.6) is about 0.8808, log(7.649) is roughly 0.8842.

So, log(0.7649)=0.8842 -1 = -0.1158.

So pH =7.21 -0.1158=7.0942.

[H+] =10^(-7.0942) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0942) → 10^(-0.0942) ≈ 0.820 → [H+] = 8.20e-8 M.

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02804) / (8.20e-8) → let's calculate numerator and denominator precisely.

Numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02804 = 5.0472e-14.

Denominator: 8.20e-8.

So 5.0472e-14 / 8.20e-8 = (5.0472 / 8.20) * 1e-6.

5.0472 /8.20 = approximately 0.6156.

So 0.6156e-6 =6.156e-7 M.

Hmm. So the calculation gives 6.156e-7, which is close to option A (6.24e-7) but not exactly matching. Perhaps I made a miscalculation in the ratio.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio more accurately.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02804 M.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.0367 M.

Ratio: 0.02804 / 0.0367 = ?

Let me compute 0.02804 / 0.0367.

0.02804 ÷ 0.0367 → same as 2804 ÷ 3670 → approximately 0.7649.

Wait, but let's compute it more accurately:

3670 × 0.7649 = ?

3670 × 0.7 = 2569.

3670 × 0.06 = 220.2.

3670 × 0.0049 ≈ 17.983.

Adding up: 2569 +220.2=2789.2 +17.983=2807.183.

But 3670 × 0.7649= 2807.183.

But the actual numerator is 2804, which is less than 2807.183.

So, 2804 ÷ 3670 = 0.7649 - (3.183/3670) ≈ 0.7649 - 0.000866 ≈ 0.7640.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 2804 / 3670.

Let me compute 2804 ÷ 3670.

Well, 3670 × 0.764 ≈ 0.764 × 3670 = ?

0.7 × 3670 = 2569.

0.06 × 3670 = 220.2 → 2569+220.2=2789.2.

0.004 ×3670=14.68 → 2789.2+14.68=2803.88.

So 0.764 ×3670≈2803.88. Which is just under 2804. So 2804/3670≈0.764005.

So, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is approximately 0.764005.

So, log(0.764005) = ?

Using a calculator, log(0.764005) is approximately -0.1158.

So, pH =7.21 - 0.1158 →7.0942.

[H+] =10^-7.0942 ≈8.20e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02804) / (8.20e-8) = 5.0472e-14 / 8.20e-8 = (5.0472 /8.20) *1e-6.

5.0472 ÷8.20 = let's compute:

8.20 ×0.615 = 5.043.

So, 5.0472 -5.043=0.0042.

8.20 ×0.0005 =0.0041.

So, 0.615 +0.0005 =0.6155.

So 5.0472 /8.20 ≈0.6155.

So, [PO4^3-] =0.6155e-6 =6.155e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.16e-7 M.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: 6.24e-7 M.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step of considering the orthophosphate as PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering HPO4^2- as orthophosphate. If that's the case, then the concentration would be 0.02804 M, which is 2.804e-2 M, but that's not one of the options. So, that's not the case.

But given that the options are all around 1e-7 M, it's clear that the question is about PO4^3-.

So, perhaps the answer is option A:6.24e-7 M. But my calculation is 6.15e-7, which is close but not exactly matching. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Alternatively, perhaps I should recalculate with more precise values.

Let me recompute the numerator and denominator.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g / 177.99 g/mol= 0.005608 mol.

Volume 0.2 L → [HPO4^2-]=0.005608/0.2= 0.02804 M.

KH2PO4:1.00g /136.09 g/mol= 0.007340 mol. → [H2PO4^-]=0.007340/0.2=0.0367 M.

Ratio =0.02804/0.0367=0.7649.

pH= pKa2 + log(0.7649) → pKa2=7.2096 (exact calculation:Ka2=6.2e-8 → pKa2=7.2096).

log(0.7649)= -0.1158 → pH=7.2096-0.1158=7.0938.

[H+] =10^-7.0938 → compute this.

10^-7.0938 =10^-7 *10^-0.0938.

10^-0.0938 ≈ 0.820 → [H+] =8.20e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02804) / (8.20e-8) → (5.0472e-14)/8.20e-8 =5.0472e-14/8.20e-8 → 6.155e-7 M.

Hmm, so approximately 6.16e-7 M. The options don't have that, but option A is 6.24e-7. Wait, perhaps the problem uses more precise Ka values or exact calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the [PO4^3-] using the exact expressions.

Another approach: use the expression:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]

So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

We have [H+] =8.20e-8 M.

Ka3=1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-]=0.02804 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02804) / 8.20e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02804=5.0472e-14.

Divide by 8.20e-8: 5.0472e-14/8.20e-8 = (5.0472/8.20) * 1e-6.

5.0472 ÷8.20= 0.6155 → 0.6155e-6=6.155e-7 M.

So, 6.155e-7 M is approximately 6.16e-7, which is not exactly any option. But looking at the options:

Option A:6.24e-7.

Option B:5.48e-7.

Hmm, maybe I should check if I used the correct pKa.

Wait, pKa2 is for H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-.

But in the calculation, I used pKa2=7.21.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact value for pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)).

Wait, let me compute pKa2 precisely.

Ka2=6.2e-8 → pKa2= -log(6.2e-8)= log(1/(6.2e-8)).

log(6.2e-8)= log(6.2) + log(1e-8)=0.7924 -8= -7.2076 → pKa2=7.2076.

So, pH=7.2076 + log(0.7649) =7.2076-0.1158=7.0918.

So, [H+]=10^-7.0918=8.20e-8 M.

Wait, but that's the same as before, so [PO4^3-] would still be approximately 6.15e-7 M.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- without considering the pH effect on the ratio. But that doesn't make sense because HPO4^2- is part of a buffer system.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the initial concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will affect the pH, which in turn affects the concentration of PO4^3-.

But I think that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total phosphate concentration and then find the fraction that is in the PO4^3- form.

Wait, total phosphate would be the sum of H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-, but in this solution, the major species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because the pH is around 7.09, which is between pKa2 and pKa3.

Wait, but in any case, the calculation for [PO4^3-] is the same as before, so perhaps the answer is option A.

Wait, but the options don't have 6.15e-7. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the moles.

KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00734 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g /177.99 g/mol=0.005608 mol.

Volume is 0.2 L.

So, [H2PO4^-]=0.00734/0.2=0.0367 M.

[HPO4^2-]=0.005608/0.2=0.02804 M.

That's correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is mixing up the terms, and the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2-.

If that's the case, the concentration is 0.02804 M, which is 2.804e-2 M, but the options are around 1e-7, so that can't be.

Therefore, the correct approach is to find [PO4^3-], which yields approximately 6.15e-7 M, which is closest to option A:6.24e-7.

But wait, perhaps I should compute the values more precisely.

Let me compute 5.0472e-14 /8.20e-8 precisely.

5.0472e-14 ÷8.20e-8 = (5.0472 ÷8.20) *1e-6.

5.0472 ÷8.20 = ?

8.20 ×0.615 =5.043.

5.0472 -5.043=0.0042.

0.0042 /8.20 =0.000512.

So, 0.615 + 0.000512=0.615512.

So, 5.0472e-14 ÷8.20e-8 =0.615512e-6 =6.15512e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.155e-7 M.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: 6.24e-7 M. But 6.155 is closer to 6.16e-7, which isn't an option.

Wait, the options are:

A)6.24e-7

B)5.48e-7

C)2.81e-7

D)3.97e-7

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternative approach: perhaps the problem is not considering the buffer but expecting to use the third dissociation step for HPO4^2-.

So, in solution, we have [HPO4^2-] =0.02804 M.

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2- ] → [PO4^3- ]= (Ka3 × [HPO4^2- ]) / [H+]

But to find [H+], perhaps the problem uses a different approach.

Wait, but how else would we find [H+]? Since the solution is a buffer, we can't assume it's neutral, but perhaps the problem is using the concentration of H+ based on one of the dissociation steps.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is expecting to find the concentration of HPO4^2- without considering the buffer effect. But that doesn't make sense because the presence of both salts would create a buffer.

Wait, but perhaps the solution is not a buffer because the amounts are not in a 1:1 ratio. No, the buffer can exist even if the concentrations are not equal.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to treat the solution as a mixture and use the exact Ka expressions.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact pH by considering the contributions from both salts.

But that would complicate things, and I don't think it's necessary because the buffer equation should suffice.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- which is 0.02804 M, but that's 2.8e-2 M, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, which is HPO4^2-, and not PO4^3-.

But then the answer would be 0.02804 M, which is not an option. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the total concentration of phosphate ions, but that would include all forms, which isn't the case.

Hmm, perhaps I should reevaluate my initial assumption that orthophosphate is PO4^3-.

Upon checking, I think orthophosphate can refer to both HPO4^2- and PO4^3-, but sometimes it's specifically PO4^3-.

Wait, let me think. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, and the orthophosphate ion is PO4^3-.

So, the problem is asking for PO4^3-.

But according to my calculations, it's approximately 6.15e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with pKa3.

Wait, wait. Wait, no, because pKa3 is 11.74, which is much higher than the pH of 7.09.

So, in solution, the HPO4^2- is the dominant species, but some of it will dissociate into PO4^3- as per Ka3.

But according to my calculation, [PO4^3-] is ~6.15e-7 M.

Since option A is 6.24e-7, which is close, perhaps that's the intended answer.

But why is there a discrepancy? Let me check if I used the correct value for [HPO4^2-].

Wait, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02804 M, and [H+] is 8.20e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02804) / 8.20e-8.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values.

Let me compute 1.8e-12 *0.02804 = 5.0472e-14.

Divide by 8.20e-8 →5.0472e-14 /8.20e-8 = (5.0472/8.20) *1e-6.

5.0472 divided by 8.20 is approximately 0.6155.

So, 0.6155e-6 →6.155e-7 M.

But none of the options match that. The closest is option A, which is 6.24e-7.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the initial calculation of the ratio.

Wait, when I calculated the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-], I used 0.02804/0.0367 =0.7649.

But perhaps more accurately, 0.02804/0.0367=0.7649.

Taking the log of 0.7649 gives me approximately -0.1158.

So, pH=7.21 -0.1158=7.0942.

So, [H+]=10^-7.0942=8.20e-8 M.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this with more precision.

Compute 10^-7.0942:

The exponent is 7.0942. 10^-7 is 1e-7.

10^(-0.0942) = 10^( - (0.0942)).

Using logarithm tables, 10^(-0.0942) = 0.820.

So, [H+] = 8.20e-8 M.

Alternatively, using natural logarithm for more precise calculation:

ln(10^x)=x ln(10)= x*2.302585.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator approach, but I'm not great with exact values.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of an ICE table approach with the third dissociation, but I think that's what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of the total concentration of phosphate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply to find the concentration of HPO4^2- without considering any dissociation, but that would be 0.02804 M, which isn't an option.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: The solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, which form a buffer with pKa2 of 7.21. The pH is determined by the ratio of their concentrations.

Once I find the pH, I can find the concentration of PO4^3- via the third dissociation.

Wait, but I think I've done that.

Wait, perhaps I should compute all the steps with more precise numbers.

Let me try to compute [PO4^3-] again.

Ka3 =1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-]=0.02804 M.

[H+]=8.20e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 × [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] = (1.8e-12 ×0.02804) /8.20e-8.

1.8e-12 ×0.02804 = (1.8 × 0.02804) ×1e-12 → 0.050472 ×1e-12 =5.0472e-14.

5.0472e-14 /8.20e-8 = (5.0472 /8.20) ×1e-6.

5.0472/8.20= 0.6155.

0.6155e-6 =6.155e-7 M.

So, it's approximately 6.155e-7 M.

Given the options, the closest is option A, which is 6.24e-7.

Perhaps the problem expects rounding to three significant figures, which would make it 6.16e-7, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses more precise pKa values.

Wait, perhaps the pKa2 is more precisely 7.2096, and [H+] is 8.20e-8 M.

Wait, perhaps using exact pH:

[H+]=10^(-7.0942)= 8.20e-8 M.

So, the calculation is correct.

Thus, the answer should be option A:6.24e-7 M.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The relevant dissociation step for orthophosphate is:

\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles and concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- **KH₂PO₄**:  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.00734 \, \text{mol} \)  
  Concentration = \( \frac{0.00734}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.0367 \, \text{M} \)  

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.00561 \, \text{mol} \)  
  Concentration = \( \frac{0.00561}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.02805 \, \text{M} \)  

### Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base). The relevant \( \text{pKa} \) is for the second dissociation of H₃PO₄:

\[
\text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.21
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}\right)
\]

Substitute the concentrations:

\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + \log\left(\frac{0.02805}{0.0367}\right)
\]

\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + \log(0.7649) \approx 7.21 - 0.115 \approx 7.095
\]

### Step 3: Calculate [H⁺]
From the pH:

\[
[\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.095} \approx 8.20 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 4: Use the dissociation expression for PO₄³⁻
The third dissociation of H₃PO₄ is:

\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]

Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02805)}{8.20 \times 10^{-8}}
\]

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.049 \times 10^{-14}}{8.20 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.15 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the closest option
The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately \( 6.15 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which is closest to option **A: \( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: A**
