Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and then it's reacted with a series of reagents. I need to figure out the final product from the options A to D.

First, I'll look at the NMR data to understand the structure.

The 1H-NMR peaks are:
- 9.72 ppm, triplet (t), 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton because aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two protons, maybe adjacent to a CH2 group.
- 6.98 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. This could be aromatic protons. The doublet might be from a para-substituted benzene, perhaps with two substituents.
- 6.51 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. Another aromatic region, same as above, so maybe another para-substituted ring.
- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something else, like an OH group. Or maybe it's a conjugated double bond, but the broadness makes me think more of OH.
- 3.66 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. This is a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe it's connected to an oxygen, like OCH2.

Putting this together, the structure probably has an aldehyde group, two aromatic rings (as each has 2H in their regions), and an OCH2 group. The broad singlet at 6.27 might be a hydroxyl group that's exchanging, maybe in a phenol group.

Wait, but the formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation formula: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So (2*8+2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-9-1+1)/2= (9)/2=4.5? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should recalculate.

Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So, H is 9, N=1, O=1. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. Each degree is a ring or a double bond.

So, five could be: one ring (benzene) which is three, a double bond (like an aldehyde) and another double bond elsewhere. Or maybe two rings and a double bond, but that's less likely.

Looking at the NMR, the aldehyde is present. Then the two aromatic regions (each 2H) suggest two para-substituted benzene rings. Because each doublet in the aromatic area could be from such substitution.

Wait, but looking at the peaks: 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted benzene. So perhaps two benzene rings connected in some way.

The 3.66 ppm is a CH2 group. So perhaps the molecule has two benzene rings attached to a central chain. Let's see: perhaps it's something like benzaldehyde with substituents.

Wait, another thought: The aldehyde is at around 9.72. Then, the 6.27 could be a conjugated double bond. Wait, but that's a singlet and broad. Maybe that's a ketone group? No, wait, the aldehyde is a CHO.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a diaryl compound with an aldehyde and an OCH2 group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde connected to another benzene ring. Or maybe two 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde groups connected with a CH2 group.

Wait, but the formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the atoms. Let's say two benzene rings (each C6H5), but that would be C12, which is way too high. So maybe not two benzene rings. Alternatively, perhaps one benzene ring and another substituent.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So, 8 carbons. If one ring is benzene (6 carbons), then the remaining two carbons are in the substituent. So, for example, maybe a benzene ring with a substituent that has two carbons plus an aldehyde and an OCH2 group.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like benzaldehyde (C7H6O) attached to another group. Let's see, the formula is C8H9NO, so perhaps another substituent with two carbons and one N and O, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a coumarin derivative, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the substituents are two phenyl groups attached to a chain. Let me try to think of that.

Suppose there's a central chain: maybe something like CH2-CHO, which would account for the aldehyde and the CH2. But then, how are the two aromatic groups attached?

Wait, perhaps the structure is a 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (which is C7H6O2) but that's only 7 carbons. Hmm, but our formula is C8H9NO.

Another approach: Let me think about the reagents. The reaction steps are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl (probably a diazotization reaction, like forming a diazonium salt)
2. H2O (maybe hydrolysis)
3. Aqueous KOH with heat (probably some kind of elimination or saponification)

So the initial compound is being diazotized, then treated with water, then with KOH and heat.

Wait, wait, but diazotization is typically done with aromatic amines. So if the initial compound has an aromatic amine, it would form a diazonium salt. But the molecular formula has N, so perhaps it's an aniline derivative.

But the NMR doesn't show any NH signals, but that could be because the sample is in D2O or maybe the NH is exchanged. Alternatively, perhaps the amine is somewhere else.

Wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 9.72 ppm, which is likely the aldehyde. So the compound might have an aldehyde group and an aromatic amine.

Wait, but I might be getting confused. Let me think again.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's see: 8 carbons. An aldehyde is CHO (so 1C), benzene rings would take up 6 carbons, but 6+1=7, which leaves one more carbon. Alternatively, perhaps a chain with substituents.

Wait, the OCH2 group in the NMR is 2H, so that's a CH2 connected to something electronegative, like O. So maybe OCH2CH2– or OCH2–.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with an OCH2 group attached, but that's just a guess.

Wait, let me think about the NMR again.

The 9.72 ppm is a triplet. So the aldehyde (RCHO) is next to a CH2 group. Because the aldehyde proton (H) is a triplet, it must be coupling with two protons. So the structure would be CH2–CHO, where the CH2 is adjacent to the aldehyde. So the aldehyde is at the end, and the CH2 is next to it.

So for example, perhaps the structure is Ph–CH2–CHO, but then where are the other signals?

Wait, but the NMR shows two aromatic regions: 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H). That could be a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Alternatively, perhaps two benzene rings each with substituents.

Wait, another thought: the two doublets in the aromatic region (each 2H) could come from two para-substituted benzene rings connected in a way that their protons are each a doublet. For example, each benzene is connected to a substituent that's adjacent to another substituent, causing the coupling.

So perhaps the compound is a diphenyl compound, like diphenyl ketone or something, but with an aldehyde and an OCH2 group.

Wait, the OCH2 is at 3.66 ppm, a doublet. So that's two protons next to an oxygen. So maybe the structure is something like Ph–O–CH2–CHO.

But wait, the molecular formula would be C13H10O2, which is way more than C8H9NO. So that can't be right.

Hmmm. Another approach: Let's consider the possible structure based on the NMR.

The triplet at 9.72 is the aldehyde proton. So, the structure must have an aldehyde group adjacent to a CH2 group. So, R–CHO, where R is CH2–X.

Then the 3.66 ppm is a doublet, which is CH2–O–something. So maybe the structure is Ph–O–CH2–CHO. But that's 8 carbons? Let me count:

Ph is 6C, O, then CH2 (2C), CHO (another C). So 6+2+1=9 C? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So 8 carbons. Let's think: perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde with some substituent.

Wait, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde is C7H6O2. But our formula is C8H9NO, which has an extra carbon, more H, and an N. So perhaps there's an NH group.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any NH signals. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a diaryl compound connected via a chain that includes an aldehyde and an OCH2 group.

Wait, let's think about the reagents again. The first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl, which is used to prepare a diazonium salt. Then H2O, perhaps a hydrolysis, and then KOH and heat, which could be a saponification or elimination.

If the starting material is an aromatic amine, then the first step would produce a diazonium salt. But in the NMR, I don't see any NH signals, so maybe the amine is already part of a ring or something.

Wait, the compound has an N in the formula. So perhaps it's an aniline derivative, but the NMR doesn't show NH. Maybe it's a secondary amine or a tertiary amine? Or perhaps the N is in a ring, like a piperidine, but that's just a guess.

Wait, maybe the N is in a substituent like –NHOCH3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the N is part of an amide group. But I don't see any amide protons in the NMR. Or maybe it's an aromatic amine that's been deprotonated.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. That could be an –OH group. Like a phenol. Because phenols can exchange and give broad signals. So maybe the structure has a phenol group.

So perhaps the structure is 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde with some substituent.

Wait, let me try to sketch a possible structure. Suppose we have a benzaldehyde ring (PhCHO), with an OCH2 group attached somewhere. But then where are the other aromatic signals?

Alternatively, perhaps the compound has two benzene rings connected by a chain that includes an aldehyde and an OCH2 group.

Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So 8 carbons. Let me imagine a structure: benzaldehyde (PhCHO) is 7 carbons (6 in benzene, 1 in CHO). So the 8th carbon is possibly in a substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an OCH2 group attached to another benzene ring. But then that would be more than 8 carbons.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about the options given.

The options are A to D, all seem to be aldehydes with phenyl groups.

Looking at the options:

A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal
Structure: Ph–CH2–CH2–CHO with a double bond at position 3? Or wait, buten-al is CH2=CH–CHO.

Wait, but 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal would be Ph–CH2–CH2–CHO with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Or maybe the position is different.

Option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. So that's a four-carbon chain with a double bond at position 3, an aldehyde at the end, and a 4-hydroxyphenyl group at position 4.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is Ph–CH2–CH2–CHO with some substitution.

Wait, but perhaps the starting material is 4-hydroxy-3-phenylbut-2-enal. Then, when treated with the reagents, it undergoes some reaction.

Wait, but the initial reagents are NaNO2 and HCl, which usually are for diazotization. So the starting material must have an aromatic amine.

Hmm, maybe the starting compound is a benzylamine derivative. So, perhaps it's 4-hydroxy-3-phenylbutan-1-amine. Then, adding NaNO2 and HCl would form a diazonium salt. Then, hydrolysis would convert it to a phenol.

Wait, that's a possibility. Let me think: if the starting material is an aniline derivative with an aldehyde group and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but the formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the molecular weight: 12*8 + 1*9 +14 +16= 96 +9 +14 +16= 135 g/mol.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde with some substitution. Wait, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde is C7H6O2, which is 7 carbons. So our compound is C8H9NO—so one more carbon, and includes N.

So perhaps it's 4-hydroxy-3-(phenyl)propanal. Wait, that would be C9H8O2, which is more than 8 carbons. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with a hydroxy group and an OCH2 group attached.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde derivative with an ethyl group or something.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the reactions.

Step 1: NaNO2 and HCl. This is for diazotization, which requires an aromatic primary amine. So the starting material has an -NH2 group attached to an aromatic ring.

Step 2: H2O. This might be a hydrolysis. Diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis under certain conditions, but more commonly, they are treated with water under acidic or basic conditions to form phenols or other products.

Wait, but if the diazonium salt is treated with water, perhaps it undergoes hydrolysis to form a phenol. For example, Ar-NH2 → Ar-N2+ → Ar-OH after hydrolysis.

So the starting material would have an aromatic amine, which is converted to a phenol after the first two steps.

But wait, the initial NMR doesn't show any NH signals. So maybe the starting material's amine is not an aromatic amine but perhaps a secondary or tertiary amine. Or maybe it's a substituent elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzylamine derivative, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure of the starting material is 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde with an amine substituent.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are all aldehydes with phenyl groups. So the starting material, after reaction, becomes one of these.

The reaction steps:

1. Diazotization: so starting material has NH2 group.

2. Hydrolysis: which would convert the NH2 to OH.

3. KOH and heat: perhaps saponification if there's an ester, or elimination if there's a β-hydroxy group.

Wait, so perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde with an amino group, which is converted to a hydroxyl group after hydrolysis. Then, under basic conditions, maybe elimination occurs.

Alternatively, maybe it's a β-hydroxybenzaldehyde derivative.

Wait, let me consider that the starting material is 4-hydroxy-3-phenylbutanal. Then, the diazotization step wouldn't apply because there's no amine. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look for another approach.

The NMR shows:

- Aldehyde at 9.72 (t, 1H): Next to a CH2 group.

- Two doublets in the aromatic region: 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H). These could be two para-substituted phenyl groups. So maybe the structure has two benzene rings, each para-substituted, connected via a chain.

- The 6.27 (bs, 2H) could be a hydroxyl group, maybe on a benzene ring.

- The 3.66 (d, 2H): OCH2 group.

So perhaps the structure is something like:

Ph-O-CH2-CHO

But wait, that would be four carbons (Ph-O-CH2-CHO: benzene (6C), O, CH2, CHO — but that's 6+1+2+1=10? No, perhaps I'm not counting correctly. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO.

Ph-O-CH2-CHO: Benzene (6C), O, CH2 (2C), CHO (1C): total 6+3=9... Hmm, that can't be right, as the formula is C8.

Wait, maybe it's Ph-O-CH2-CHO, but the benzene is connected via an oxygen. So that's 6 + 3 (O, CH2, CHO) = 9 C. But our formula is C8. So maybe that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a single benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, another idea: the structure has a benzene ring with a substituent that includes an aldehyde and an OCH2 group. Maybe like Ph-CH2-CHO, but that's only 8 C? Let me count: Ph (6C) + CH2 (2C) + CHO (1C) = 9 C, which is more than our formula. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is Ph-O-CH2-CHO. But that again would be 8 C? Wait, Ph is 6C, O, CH2 (2C), CHO (1C): 6+1+2+1=10 C. No, that's too much.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-hydroxy-3-phenylbutanal. That would be:

Ph–CH2–CH(OH)–CHO?

Wait, but the molecular formula would be C8H8O3. Our compound is C8H9NO. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde with an ethyl group. But that's not matching the formula.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like benzaldehyde with an ethyl group attached, but that doesn't explain the NMR signals.

Wait, maybe the starting compound is 4-hydroxy-3-phenylpropionaldehyde. That would be Ph–CH2–CH(OH)–CHO. But I'm not sure about the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diphenylmethanol derivative. Wait, but I'm getting stuck.

Let me think about the reagents again.

Reagent 1: NaNO2 and HCl. This is for diazotization, so the starting material must have an aromatic amine. So the starting compound has an NH2 group attached to an aromatic ring.

So the starting material is an aniline derivative, with an NH2 group.

Then, step 2: H2O. This would likely hydrolyze the diazonium salt to a phenol. So, after step 2, the NH2 becomes an OH group.

So the product after step 2 would have an additional OH group.

Then, step 3: KOH and heat. This could be a base-catalyzed elimination reaction, perhaps removing a leaving group and forming a double bond.

Wait, but in the starting material, what's the structure that would allow this?

Perhaps the starting material is a substituted benzene with an amine group, an aldehyde, and an OCH2 group. Then, after diazotization and hydrolysis, the amine becomes an OH, and under basic conditions, elimination occurs, forming a double bond.

So, let me sketch this: the starting material is something like Ph–CH2–CH(NH2)–CHO.

Wait, but then step 1 would form Ph–CH2–CH(N2+Cl^-)–CHO. Then, step 2 (H2O) would replace the N2+Cl^- with OH, giving Ph–CH2–CH(OH)–CHO.

Then, step 3: KOH and heat. In basic conditions, the OH group could deprotonate, and with heat, perhaps an elimination reaction occurs. The structure would lose a water molecule, forming a double bond. So from CH2–CH(OH)–CHO, elimination would form CH2=CH–CHO.

But wait, the NMR after the reactions would show an aldehyde and a double bond.

Let me see the options again.

Option A: 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal. Structure: Ph–CH2–CH2–CH=CH–CHO? No, but that's more than 8 carbons.

Wait, but but-3-enal is CH2=CH–CH2–CHO. So 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal would have two phenyl groups on carbons 2 and 4.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph–CH2–CH2–CH=CHO. No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the product after elimination is Ph–CH2–CH2–CHO, but with a double bond formed. Hmm.

Alternatively, the initial compound is Ph–CH2–CH(NH2)–CHO, which upon diazotization and hydrolysis becomes Ph–CH2–CH(OH)–CHO. Then, under KOH and heat, the –CH(OH)–CHO would eliminate water and form a double bond, leading to Ph–CH2–CH=CHO.

Wait, but that would be a propenal derivative. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the original structure is 4-hydroxy-3-(phenylamino)butanal. Then, upon diazotization and hydrolysis, the NH2 becomes OH, and then elimination forms a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is 4-amino-3-phenylbutanal. After steps:

1. Diazotization: forms a diazonium salt.
2. Hydrolysis: converts Ar-NH2 to Ar-OH.
3. KOH, heat: elimination to form an aldehyde with a double bond.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain.

Looking back at the options, option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. Structure: CH2=CH–CHO–Ph–CH2–? No, but but-3-enal is CH2–CH2–CH=CHO. Wait, but but-3-enal would be CH2CH2CH=CHO, but I think the correct structure is CH2=CHCH2CHO, which is but-2-enal.

Wait, but the options say but-3-enal, which would be CH2CH2CH2-CH=CHO? No, aldehyde is at the end, so but-3-enal would be CH2=CHCH2CHO.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

But in any case, after the reactions, elimination would form a double bond, leading to an aldehyde with an adjacent double bond.

So, looking at the options, option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. So that's a four-carbon chain with a double bond at position 3, an aldehyde at the end, and a 4-hydroxyphenyl group at position 4.

Wait, but how does this fit with the reagents?

If the starting material is 4-(4-amino-phenyl)butanal, then:

1. Diazotization would form a diazonium salt.
2. Hydrolysis would replace the amine with OH, giving 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal.
3. Then, KOH and heat would cause elimination. But 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal already has an aldehyde, so elimination might form a double bond.

Wait, but that would require the presence of a β-hydroxy group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 4-(4-amino-phenyl)-3-hydroxybutanal. Then, after the reactions, the OH would stay, and elimination would form a double bond.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the possible structure again.

The initial NMR shows:

- Aldehyde (9.72, triplet)
- Two sets of aromatic protons (each 2H, doublets)
- Broad singlet (possibly OH)
- OCH2 (3.66, d)

So, perhaps the starting material is 4-hydroxy-3-(4-aminophenyl)butanal.

But the formula is C8H9NO, so let's count:

- 4-hydroxyphenyl group: C7H7O2
- butanal: butyraldehyde is C4H8O, but here substituents might change the count.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.

The correct answer is probably option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.

Because after the reactions, the amine is replaced by OH, and elimination forms the double bond.

So the steps would be:

1. Diazotization converts the amine to a diazonium salt.
2. Hydrolysis replaces the diazonium group with OH, giving a hydroxyl group.
3. KOH and heat cause elimination, forming a double bond adjacent to the aldehyde.

So the final product would be an aldehyde with a double bond and a hydroxyl-substituted phenyl group.

Looking at the options, option D fits this description.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound has the molecular formula **C8H9NO**, and the provided NMR data indicates the presence of an aldehyde group (triplet at 9.72 ppm), two para-substituted aromatic rings (doublets at 6.98 and 6.51 ppm), a broad singlet (6.27 ppm, likely an OH group), and an OCH2 group (doublet at 3.66 ppm). The sequence of reactions involves diazotization (NaNO2 + HCl), hydrolysis (H2O), and basic conditions with heat (aqueous KOH, heat). 

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reagents and Reaction Pathway**:
   - **Step 1 (NaNO2 + HCl)**: This step typically converts an aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt.
   - **Step 2 (H2O)**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH).
   - **Step 3 (aqueous KOH, heat)**: Basic conditions and heat likely induce elimination, forming a double bond.

2. **Structure of the Starting Material**:
   - The starting material must contain an aromatic amine (-NH2) to undergo diazotization. After hydrolysis, this amine is replaced by a hydroxyl group. The NMR data suggests the presence of an aldehyde, two para-substituted aromatic rings, and an OCH2 group.

3. **Reaction Outcome**:
   - After the first two steps, the aromatic amine is converted to a hydroxyl group, resulting in a compound with an aldehyde, two para-substituted aromatic rings, and a hydroxyl group.
   - In the final step (aqueous KOH, heat), elimination occurs, forming a double bond adjacent to the aldehyde group.

4. **Matching with the Options**:
   - **Option A (2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal)**: This structure does not match the expected elimination product, as it lacks the hydroxyl group.
   - **Option B (2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal)**: This structure has two hydroxyl groups but does not match the expected elimination pattern.
   - **Option C (3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal)**: This structure is inconsistent with the reaction sequence and the NMR data.
   - **Option D (4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal)**: This structure aligns with the reaction pathway. The hydroxyl group from hydrolysis and the double bond formed during elimination match the expected product.

### Conclusion:
The final product after the reaction sequence is **4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal**, which corresponds to **Option D**.

**Answer: D**
