Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), and I need to figure out which symmetries the operators must respect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives four options: Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these, and I need to pick the correct set that all operators in SMEFT must obey.

Wait, first, what's SMEFT? From what I remember, SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension, and they're supposed to respect certain symmetries. Symmetries are crucial because they constrain the form of the theory and what interactions are allowed.

So, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let's break down each of the four options.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, right? Because the Standard Model itself is Lorentz symmetric, and SMEFT extends it. So all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. That makes sense because without that, the theory wouldn't make sense in a relativistic context.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Wait, but in a theory like SMEFT, the operators are part of a local theory, so they should respect local symmetries. But wait, SMEFT is an effective theory where the high-energy physics is integrated out. I think SMEFT operators are built respecting the Poincare symmetry. Because, for example, the operators are written in terms of the SM fields and their covariant derivatives, which include Lorentz and gauge symmetries. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe Poincare is automatically included if Lorentz and other symmetries are respected. Or perhaps Poincare is a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz, translations, etc. So, if the operators are part of a relativistic theory, they must respect Poincare. But wait, SMEFT usually is constructed in a way that includes all the SM symmetries, which includes Poincare. So probably, yes, operators must respect Poincare. Or wait, maybe the question is about which symmetries are necessarily respected by all operators. Because some of the operators might not respect CP symmetry, but all must respect Lorentz and Poincare? Or perhaps Poincare is a larger symmetry that includes Lorentz, so if operators respect Lorentz, they might not necessarily respect Poincare? Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, the SM includes Poincare symmetry. SMEFT is an effective theory that's consistent with the SM, so the SMEFT operators must also respect the same symmetries as the SM. The SM is Poincare symmetric, so SMEFT operators must be as well. So 2. Poincare symmetry must be respected.

3. CP symmetry: The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry in general because of things like CP violation in the CKM matrix. So SMEFT operators can violate CP. But wait, the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. I think not necessarily. So operators in SMEFT might or might not respect CP. So 3 is not a must.

4. CPT symmetry: The SM is CPT symmetric. I remember that the CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant quantum theory must be CPT symmetric. So if the theory is Lorentz-invariant, it's automatically CPT-invariant. So since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must respect CPT. So 4 must be respected.

Wait, so putting it all together:

Which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect? 1, 2, and 4.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. Option D is 1,3,4. 

Wait, but wait about Poincare symmetry. Or is Poincare symmetry automatically included in the SMEFT framework? Because the question is about what the operators must respect. SMEFT operators are constructed in a way that respects the SM's symmetries. The SM is Poincare-invariant, so all SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry.

Wait, but wait. Lorentz symmetry is a subset of Poincare symmetry. So if a theory respects Poincare, it respects Lorentz. But does the converse hold? No. So for the question, which symmetries must be respected. So 1, Lorentz, must be respected, but is 2, Poincare, also required? Or is 2 automatically satisfied because the operators are constructed in a way that respects it.

Wait, perhaps I was mistaken earlier. Maybe the SMEFT operators are included respecting the SM's symmetries, which include Poincare. So all operators must respect Poincare. So 2 is also a must.

Wait, but another thought: SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory. It's built by expanding around the SM vacuum, and including higher-dimensional operators that are compatible with the SM's symmetry structure. So the SMEFT operators must respect the same symmetries as the SM. The SM has Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT operators must also respect that. So 2 is a must.

But wait, another angle: Do the SMEFT operators include terms that could break Poincare? I don't think so, because the higher-dimension operators are built from SM fields and derivatives, which respect Poincare. So yes, they must respect Poincare.

So, all operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). But wait, the question is about which must be respected by all operators. So 1, 2, and 4 — that would correspond to option C.

Looking back, the options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about Poincare. Because Poincare includes translations, which are part of the spacetime symmetries. In SMEFT, when you have higher-dimension operators, like (1/Lambda) (field)^n, the operators are constructed with all necessary symmetries. For example, they must be scalars under the gauge group and Lorentz group. So they are constructed using covariant derivatives, which respect gauge and Lorentz symmetries. So yes, Poincare is respected because the theories are built in a way that includes translation symmetry as part of the framework. Thus, all operators must respect Poincare.

Therefore, the correct answer includes 1,2,4. So option C.

To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a relativistic theory that extends the Standard Model, which itself respects Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is constructed to respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model, and the Standard Model is Poincaré-invariant, all SMEFT operators must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model, and by extension SMEFT, does not necessarily respect CP symmetry. CP violation is present in the Standard Model (e.g., in the CKM matrix), and SMEFT operators can violate CP symmetry. Thus, CP symmetry is not a symmetry that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant quantum theory must be CPT-invariant. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct option is:

**Answer: C**
