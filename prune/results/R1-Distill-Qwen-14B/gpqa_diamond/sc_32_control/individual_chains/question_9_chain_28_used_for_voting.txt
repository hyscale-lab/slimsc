Okay, so I have this question about molecular symmetry and which one has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my point groups, but let me think through this.

First, I remember that point groups are about the symmetry elements a molecule has. C3h symmetry means there's a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation around that axis and also have a mirror plane that's horizontal.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran... Hmm, the name suggests a complex structure with multiple rings. I'm not exactly sure, but triphenylene has a certain symmetry. Wait, triphenylene is like three benzene rings fused in a way, maybe like a triangle? Or perhaps it's a linear arrangement. But I'm not certain if it has C3h symmetry. Maybe if it's symmetric around an axis with three-fold rotation and a mirror plane.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran... So benzo implies a benzene ring attached. The trifuran part suggests three furan rings connected. Wait, the way the substituents are attached might influence symmetry. If the molecule has three substituents around a central axis, maybe that's a C3 element. But the presence of a mirror plane? I'm not sure. Maybe it's more of a C3v symmetry, which includes a vertical mirror plane, but not necessarily a horizontal one.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. Wait, triisopropyl borate has a boron atom with three isopropyl groups attached. Isopropyl groups are symmetric themselves, each being a CH(CH3)2. So the structure is trigonal planar around boron? But wait, boron usually has three substituents. If all three substituents are the same, that gives a C3 axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm, in the trigonal planar structure, the mirror planes would be in the plane of the molecule, perhaps. Wait, but C3h requires a horizontal mirror plane. The trigonal planar molecule usually has three vertical mirror planes (like C3v), but maybe in this case, the structure isn't planar. Wait, no, for triisopropyl borate, the structure is likely trigonal pyramidal? No, wait, no. Boron in such compounds is usually in the center with three substituents arranged in a triangle, which would be trigonal planar. Wait, but the molecule as a whole—does it have a plane of symmetry? If the molecule is flat, like a trigonal planar arrangement, then a horizontal mirror plane would pass through the boron and bisect the substituents. So if the molecule is planar, then yes, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is non-planar, but since all substituents are identical, the symmetry might be higher.

Option D: Quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic structure, I think. It's a seven-membered ring with two bridgeheads. Wait, the structure is like a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane or something? Oh wait, no, quinuclidine is actually a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane derivative, making it a cage compound. What's its symmetry? Quinuclidine has a three-fold axis? I'm not sure. Wait, I think quinuclidine is a tricyclic compound, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, I remember that quinuclidine has a three-fold rotational symmetry. If that's the case, then it might have C3 symmetry. But what about the mirror plane? If the molecule is symmetric with a horizontal mirror passing through the center, then it would have C3h. But I'm not entirely certain. I think quinuclidine's structure is such that it has a three-fold axis but may or may not have a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, so which of these options has both a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane?

Triisopropyl borate (option C) is a trigonal planar molecule around boron. So the central boron is in a plane, with three identical isopropyl groups. That would have a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane. But a horizontal mirror plane would be perpendicular to the C3 axis. Wait, no, the C3 axis is vertical, so a horizontal mirror plane would be in the plane of the molecule. Hmm, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let's think: for C3h symmetry, the molecule must have a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). The combination of these two elements would give C3h.

Another approach: the common examples of C3h symmetry. I think molecules like trimethylamine (though that's a different structure) might have such symmetry. Alternatively, molecules that are triangular with three identical substituents and a horizontal mirror would fit.

Wait, triisopropyl borate: each isopropyl group is symmetric. So if the molecule is planar around the boron, then a horizontal mirror plane would pass through the boron, reflecting each isopropyl group onto another. But wait, in a trigonal planar arrangement, the molecule is flat, so a mirror plane through the center (the boron) in a plane perpendicular to the C3 axis (like the plane of the paper) would be a vertical mirror plane, which is σv. But C3h requires a horizontal σh, which is perpendicular to the C3 axis. So if the C3 axis is vertical, the horizontal mirror would be a plane that's horizontal, like slicing through the molecule from top to bottom.

Wait, if the molecule is planar, then the C3 axis would be in the plane, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the boron would be at the center, and the three isopropyl groups sticking out in 120-degree angles around it. So the molecule is in a single plane—like a flat triangle. So the C3 axis would be perpendicular to that plane. So a horizontal mirror plane would pass through the boron and bisect each isopropyl group. So yes, the structure would have a C3 axis (perpendicular) and a horizontal mirror plane (passing through the center). So that would make the point group C3h.

But wait, another thought: for C3h, you need a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So the combination of these two would give certain symmetries. Alternatively, I'm getting a bit stuck on this.

What about the other options? Benzo[...]trifuran... Maybe it's a six-membered ring with substituents. If it's a central furan ring with three substituents, like a trifuran connected to a benzene ring. But if the substituents are in a symmetric arrangement, perhaps it has a C3 axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Not sure.

Triphenylene part: Triphenylene has three benzene rings connected in a linear fashion. Wait, no, I think triphenylene is a structure with three benzene rings fused together in a tricyclic arrangement. But I'm not certain about its symmetry. If it's a linear arrangement, perhaps it's less symmetric.

Quinuclidine, the structure is more complex. It's a bicyclic compound with a bridge, so maybe it has a three-fold axis but not a horizontal mirror plane. Or perhaps it doesn't, depending on the actual structure.

Wait, another angle: What's the structure of each option? Let me think.

Triisopropyl borate: Structure is B with three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is CH(CH3)2. So the molecule is trigonal planar around B. The three substituents are identical and at 120 degrees apart. So the structure has a C3 axis (along the B atom's axis, perpendicular to the plane of the molecule). And the molecule is symmetric across any plane that contains the B atom and bisects two substituents. So these are vertical mirror planes, which implies C3v symmetry. But C3v doesn't include a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So if the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane, that might not be the case here. Wait, because the plane of the molecule is where the substituents lie. Wait, suppose the molecule is planar, so the plane of the molecule is the "horizontal" plane. If that's the case, then a mirror plane through the B atom, in the plane of the substituents, would be a σh (horizontal). But wait, in the point group notation, the σh is a horizontal mirror plane. So if the molecule is planar, then any mirror plane in that plane would be a σh. But wait, for a trigonal planar molecule like BF3, the point group is D3h, which includes a C3 axis and multiple mirror planes, including σh.

Wait, so D3h has a C3 axis, σh, and other planes. So if the molecule has D3h symmetry, then it has a C3h subgroup. Wait, but the question is about C3h, not D3h. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe triisopropyl borate has a higher symmetry than C3h. Wait, let me think. If the molecule is flat with a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then its point group is D3h. But the question is about C3h. So maybe triisopropyl borate doesn't have C3h, but perhaps another of the options does.

Alternatively, perhaps triphenylene has C3h symmetry. Triphenylene is three benzene rings connected in a linear fashion, perhaps in a way that's symmetric. So for example, if you have three benzene rings connected in a row, the structure might have a three-fold axis going through the center, and a horizontal mirror plane. But I'm not sure about the structure.

Wait, looking up in my notes: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. The numbering might be a bit complicated, but the 'trifuran' part suggests three furan rings connected. The substituents are attached in a way that might create a symmetric structure. Alternatively, the molecule could have a central threefold axis.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, option A might be the one. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the point group for each structure.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. The structure has three identical substituents (isopropyl groups) around a central atom (B). So it's a trigonal planar molecule. Therefore, it has a C3 axis. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the molecule is planar, then the plane of the molecule itself would be a horizontal mirror plane. So yes, the molecule would have σh. Therefore, the point group would be D3h, which includes C3h. But the question is about which has C3h symmetry. So D3h is a higher symmetry group than C3h. So perhaps for the molecule to have exactly C3h, it needs to have a C3 axis and a σh plane, but without any other symmetry elements. But in reality, triisopropyl borate would have more symmetry elements, possibly making it D3h. So maybe it's not the right answer.

Wait, but the question is phrased as 'has C3h symmetry'—does that mean it's a part of a larger point group? Or does it mean that the molecule's symmetry is exactly C3h? Because if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it also has C3h as a part of its symmetry. So perhaps any molecule with a higher symmetry than C3h would also satisfy the condition. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe none of the options except one has both C3 and σh.

Let me think about each option:

Option A: Triphenyleno[...]trifuran. Hmm, triphenylene is a three-ring system, perhaps in a line. So if the molecule has three substituents in a row, it could have a C3 axis. And maybe a horizontal mirror plane. But I'm not certain.

Option B: Benzo[...]trifuran. The structure might be a benzene ring attached to a trifuran structure. If the three furan rings are arranged symmetrically, perhaps in a trigonal fashion, then it might have a C3 axis. But would it have a horizontal mirror plane? The benzene ring itself is symmetric, but the rest of the structure's arrangement is key. Not sure.

Option D: Quinuclidine. I think quinuclidine has a three-membered ring of sorts, but perhaps the symmetry is lower. It's a bicyclic structure, but I'm not certain about its point group. Maybe C2 or something else.

Wait, another thought. The C3h point group requires the presence of a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Now, the structure of triisopropyl borate is trigonal planar, which would have a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane, and a σh plane (the plane of the molecule). So yes, that would have C3h symmetry. But wait, does it have any other symmetry elements? Because if it has other mirror planes, it would belong to a higher point group.

Wait, in D3h, you have a C3 axis, a σh plane, and three vertical σv planes. So the presence of those vertical mirror planes would make it D3h, not just C3h. So if triisopropyl borate has those vertical planes, then its point group is D3h, not C3h. But the question is asking which molecule has C3h symmetry, meaning that C3h is the symmetry that the molecule has, possibly as part of a larger group. Or perhaps the question is looking for a molecule that belongs to the C3h point group, meaning it doesn't have higher symmetry.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the actual structures.

Triisopropyl borate: Structure is B with three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl group is symmetric. The molecule is planar, so the C3 axis is perpendicular to the plane. The plane of the molecule itself is a σh plane. Additionally, there are three vertical mirror planes (each containing the C3 axis and a line between two substituents). So the point group is D3h, which includes C3h as a subset.

So the question is whether any of the given options have C3h symmetry. Since triisopropyl borate has D3h, which includes C3h, perhaps it's the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the other options has exactly C3h.

Wait, what about quinuclidine. Quinuclidine has a structure that's a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane derivative. I think it's a cage-like structure. Its symmetry is such that it has a three-fold axis, but perhaps not a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, I'm not sure.

Another approach: looking for which molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror. So quinuclidine is a known structure. Let me recall: quinuclidine has a three-membered ring? No, wait, it's a seven-membered bicyclic structure. It has a bridge, so the symmetry might be lower. I'm not certain about its point group.

Benzo[...]trifuran: If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps in a trigonal fashion, then it could have a C3 axis. But whether it has a σh plane, I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the difference between C3h and D3h. In C3h, you have a C3 and a σh. In D3h, you have a C3, σh, and also three σv planes. So if a molecule only has a C3 and σh, it's C3h. If it has those plus the σv's, it's D3h.

So if the molecule in option C (triisopropyl borate) has D3h symmetry, then it doesn't have exactly C3h but a higher symmetry. So perhaps it's not the correct answer.

Looking at the other options:

Option A: Triphenyleno[...]trifuran. If the structure is such that it has three substituents arranged symmetrically, perhaps in a trigonal planar arrangement, then it might have a C3 axis. But whether it has a σh plane depends on the structure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B. Because benzo[...]trifuran... maybe it's a structure where three substituents are arranged symmetrically around a central point.

Alternatively, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the structure of triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran. I think the 'trifuran' part is three furan rings connected, and the benzo part is connected to each of them. Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the three furan rings are arranged in a way that creates a trigonal symmetry, each attached in a symmetric fashion, leading to a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror.

Alternatively, I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think of which of the options is known to have C3h symmetry.

I remember that triphenylene has a three-fold axis and a mirror plane, but I'm not sure about the exact point group.

Wait, another angle: the presence of quaternary carbons or other substituents that would break certain symmetries.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is option D: quinuclidine. Because I've heard that quinuclidine has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror. Let me think. Quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane system. The molecule has a three-membered ring fused with other rings. Wait, but does it have a three-fold axis? I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a structure that's symmetric with a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror.

Alternatively, perhaps triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (option A) has a structure that looks like a three-fold symmetry.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about what C3h looks like. The molecule should have three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror. So, for example, a trigonal prism would have C3h symmetry. But in the given options, which one resembles this.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Let me imagine the structure. It has a benzene ring attached to a trifuran system. If the three furan rings are arranged symmetrically around a benzene ring, perhaps in a trigonal fashion, then they would have a C3 axis. And if the molecule also has a horizontal mirror plane, then it would have C3h.

Alternatively, if the benzene ring is in a position that allows a horizontal mirror plane, then maybe yes.

I'm really not certain, but perhaps option C is the right one. Because the structure is symmetric, with three identical substituents. So it has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, making it C3h. But I'm not entirely sure if it's D3h instead.

Wait, another thought. In the case of triisopropyl borate, since it's a trigonal planar molecule, it should have a C3 axis, and if it has a plane of symmetry perpendicular to that axis, then it would have a σv. But for C3h, the σh is a horizontal mirror plane. So if the molecule is planar, then the plane itself is the σh, so that's present. So the point group would be D3h because it has C3, σh, and σv planes. So perhaps triisopropyl borate doesn't have C3h but a higher symmetry.

So then, which of the other options have C3h?

Going back, perhaps option B has a structure where three substituents are arranged around a central benzene ring, providing a C3 axis, and a horizontal mirror plane as well. Alternatively, maybe option A has three substituents arranged symmetrically.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the options except one have C3h. Let me think of the correct answer.

Wait, another approach: the options provided.

The options are A, B, C, D. The correct answer is one of them.

If I think that triisopropyl borate (option C) has D3h, which includes C3h, but the question is which has C3h symmetry. So perhaps the question is asking which has at least C3h, in which case option C is correct. But the other option is perhaps option B.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine (option D) has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think of what each molecule's structure is.

Benzo[...]trifuran: a benzene ring connected to a trifuran. The trifuran part would have three oxygen atoms. The way they're connected would determine symmetry. If the three furan rings are arranged symmetrically around the benzene, perhaps. Then the molecule could have a C3 axis and a horizontal plane.

Quinuclidine: I think it's a structure with a three-membered ring, but perhaps it's more of a bridge structure, making it less symmetric. Maybe it has a C3 axis but no mirror plane.

Triphenyleno[...]trifuran: three phenyl groups connected to a trifuran. If the phenyl groups are arranged symmetrically, perhaps in a trigonal arrangement, then it could have a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option A: Triphenyleno[...]trifuran.

Wait, but I'm not confident. I think I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the options, I think triisopropyl borate (option C) has D3h symmetry, which includes C3h. So the answer might be option C. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B: benzo[...]trifuran.

Wait, another approach: the question asks which molecule has C3h symmetry. I think that triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry, which includes C3h, so it would have C3h. So the answer is option C.

But I'm a bit confused because D3h is a higher symmetry group than C3h. So the molecule's symmetry is D3h, but the question is whether it has C3h symmetry, which it does as a subset.

So, the answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the symmetry elements required for **C₃h**: a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). The options are evaluated as follows:

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a trifuran system with three phenyl groups attached. If the phenyl groups are arranged symmetrically around a central axis, the molecule could have a C₃ axis. However, the presence of a horizontal mirror plane (σh) is uncertain based on the given structure. Without clear evidence of both symmetry elements, this option is unlikely to have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule includes a benzene ring connected to a trifuran system. The trifuran part suggests three oxygen atoms arranged symmetrically, potentially providing a C₃ axis. However, the benzene ring and the overall arrangement of substituents make it unclear whether a horizontal mirror plane (σh) exists. This option is also unlikely to have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option C: Triisopropyl borate  
This molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups, forming a trigonal planar structure. The molecule has a clear C₃ axis (perpendicular to the plane of the molecule). Additionally, the plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Thus, triisopropyl borate has both the C₃ and σh symmetry elements, making it a candidate for **C₃h** symmetry. However, it also has three vertical mirror planes, which would make its overall symmetry **D₃h**, not **C₃h**.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound with a complex structure. While it may have a three-fold axis (C₃), it is unlikely to have a horizontal mirror plane (σh) due to the asymmetry introduced by its bridged bicyclic framework. Therefore, it does not have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion  
Among the options, **triisopropyl borate (Option C)** is the only molecule that has both a C₃ axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). While it technically belongs to the **D₃h** point group (which includes **C₃h** as a subset), it still satisfies the condition of having **C₃h** symmetry. None of the other options clearly exhibit both required symmetry elements.

**Answer: C**
