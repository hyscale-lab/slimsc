Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out how the number of stars changes with distance based on a given relationship. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the question is asking.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the formula is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Wait, parallax is usually denoted by the letter 'p', but here it's written as 'plx', which I think is the same thing. Parallax is inversely related to distance, right? So parallax (p) equals 1 over distance (d), or p = 1/d. So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars (N) changes with distance (r), per unit range of distance. Oh, I see, so we're looking for the change in the number of stars as you move from, say, r to r+dr. It's about the density of stars in a thin shell at distance r.

So, since parallax p is inversely proportional to distance, p = 1/r. So plugging that into the given relationship: N ∝ 1/p^5 becomes N ∝ (r)^5. Because if p = 1/r, then 1/p^5 is r^5. So the number of stars is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So like, for a given thin shell at distance r, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to r^5. But wait, that doesn't seem right because I remember that the number of stars in a shell actually decreases with distance because stars are not infinitely spread out.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up things. Let's think again. The number of stars as a function of parallax is N ∝ 1/p^5. Since p = 1/r, then 1/p = r. So 1/p^5 is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. So as r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. But wait, that would imply that further away, there are more stars. That doesn't make sense because when you look further, you can see more stars, but they are spread out more. Or wait, maybe the question isn't about the total number but the number per unit volume or something else.

Wait, I think I need to relate the number of stars to the distance in terms of differential. Like, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr. Let's model that.

The number of stars in a shell is N = k * (volume) * (number density). Or wait, maybe it's more about the flux or something else.

Alternatively, the number of stars with a certain parallax contributes to the density. Since the number of stars varies as 1/p^5, and p is 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. But wait, the problem says the number varies as 1/(plx^5), which is the same as r^5. So the number of stars increases with r^5. But wait, that would mean that as you go further, you see more stars, which is counterintuitive because the density should decrease. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to model this mathematically.

Given that N ∝ 1/p^5, and p = 1/r, so N = k * r^5, where k is the constant of proportionality. But wait, the number of stars in a region shouldn't just be r^5. I think I might be missing the consideration of the volume. Because when you look at a larger distance, the volume increases, but the number of stars might not scale the same way.

Wait, no, the way the question is phrased: the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/p^5. So for each star, the number per unit parallax is 1/p^5. But how does that translate into the number per unit distance.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of the differential number of stars. Let's say that the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r is dN, and the variation is such that dN is proportional to 1/p^5. But since p = 1/r, then dN ∝ r^5. So the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but as r increases, the shell's volume increases, right? The volume of a thin shell is 4πr^2 dr. So if the number of stars in the shell is dN = (number density) * (volume). The number density here would be the number of stars per unit volume, which is probably what's given by the 1/p^5 relation.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The number of stars per unit volume (number density) is n. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/p^5. So n ∝ 1/p^5. Since p = 1/r, then n = k * r^5.

So the number density n(r) is proportional to r^5. Therefore, the number of stars in a thin shell dr is n(r) * 4πr² dr. Substituting n(r) = k r^5, we get dN = k r^5 * 4π r² dr = 4πk r^7 dr.

So the number of stars in a shell at radius r is proportional to r^7. But the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r). So for each small increase in r (dr), the number of stars per dr is dN/dr, which would be proportional to r^7.

Wait, but the options don't have r^7. The options are r^3, r^5, r^4, r^2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me try another approach. Maybe the question is simply asking for the dependence of the number of stars on distance, not considering the volume. But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, the question says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N ∝ 1/p^5. But N is the number of stars in a region. Since p = 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of r. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases as r^5.

But when I think about it, stars are spread out more as you go further, so the number shouldn't just increase without bound. Wait, perhaps the region is a fixed angular area on the sky. So the same solid angle, but varying distance. In that case, the volume increases as r squared (since the volume of a sphere is 4/3 π r^3, so the area scales as r^2).

Wait, maybe I should use the concept of flux, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's about the number density, which is stars per unit volume.

Wait, let's think step by step.

1. Parallax p is inversely proportional to distance: p = 1/r.

2. The number of stars N in a region is proportional to 1/p^5. So N ∝ 1/(p^5) → N ∝ r^5.

But wait, if N is the number of stars in a region, then as r increases, N increases as r^5. But that suggests that the number of stars increases as you go further, which seems wrong because you can't have an infinite number of stars in larger regions. So perhaps this is considering a fixed solid angle, like a small region of the sky, and how the number of stars in that region depends on distance.

Wait, for a given fixed solid angle (like a small patch), the number of stars would depend on how far you look. At a distance r, the volume of that solid angle (which is a cone) is something like (solid angle) * r^2. So the volume V = Ω * r^2, where Ω is the solid angle.

If the number density of stars is n, then the number of stars in that volume would be N = n * V = n * Ω r^2.

But according to the problem, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/p^5. Since p = 1/r, 1/p^5 = r^5. So N ∝ r^5. But substituting into our previous equation, N = (n) * Ω r^2.

Wait, so n * Ω r^2 = K r^5 → n = K r^5 / (Ω r^2) ) → n = (K/Ω) r^3.

So the number density n is proportional to r^3. Which would mean that as you go further, the number of stars per unit volume increases as r^3. That seems very high, but according to the problem statement, that's the relation.

But the question is, how does the number of stars (in a region) change with distance? Wait, perhaps the question is about the number per unit distance. Or perhaps it's about the number per unit volume, which would be the number density.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about how the number of stars in a thin shell (like a spherical shell) varies with r. Because the thickness of the shell is a small dr, the number of stars in that shell would be the number density times the volume of the shell.

The volume of a shell is 4π r^2 dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be n(r) * 4π r^2 dr.

Earlier, we found that n(r) is proportional to r^3. So substituting that in, the number of stars in the shell would be proportional to r^3 * r^2 dr = r^5 dr. So for each small increase in r (dr), the number of stars added is proportional to r^5 dr.

Wait, but the question says "per unit range of distance, r." So per unit distance (dr), the number of stars is proportional to r^5 dr. So per unit distance, the number of stars is proportional to r^5.

So looking back at the options, option B is ~r^5.

Wait, but earlier substitution suggested that N = n * V, where V scales as r^2, so n would have to scale as r^3. So the number density increases as r^3, which then implies that the number of stars in a shell scales as r^5. So the number of stars per unit distance (per dr) would go up as r^5.

So the correct answer would be option B) ~ r^5.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax \( \text{plx} \) is inversely proportional to distance \( r \) (\( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \)), this implies \( N \propto r^5 \). 

To understand how the number of stars changes with distance, consider a thin spherical shell at distance \( r \) with thickness \( dr \). The volume of this shell is proportional to \( r^2 \) (i.e., \( 4\pi r^2 dr \)). The number of stars in the shell depends on the number density of stars \( n(r) \), which is proportional to \( r^5 \) based on the given relationship. Thus, the number of stars in the shell is proportional to \( n(r) \cdot 4\pi r^2 dr \), which simplifies to \( r^5 \cdot dr \). 

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance (\( dr \)) scales as \( r^5 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is \( \sim r^5 \).
