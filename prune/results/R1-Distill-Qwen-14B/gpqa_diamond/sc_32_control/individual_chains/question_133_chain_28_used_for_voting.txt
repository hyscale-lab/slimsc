Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-, in this solution. The temperatures are at 25°C, which is standard, so I don't think that affects anything here.

Wait, but wait. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, right? Or maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think. Orthophosphate is the fully protonated form, H3PO4. But in solution, it can deprotonate into H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

The problem gives me the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So that's the first, second, and third dissociation constants.

So, the solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Hmm. Let me figure out what each of these salts dissociates into.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So, each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate (but the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O, which probably means it's the decahydrate form, but in solution, the water would dissociate, so the main ions would be Na+ and HPO4^2-.

Wait, so KH2PO4 gives H2PO4^- and Na2HPO4·2H2O gives HPO4^2-.

So in the solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. That suggests that the solution is a buffer solution because it's made from a weak acid and its conjugate base. Or wait, in this case, H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donate a proton) to become HPO4^2-, or as a base (gain a proton) to become H3PO4.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the species present. H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion, and HPO4^2- is the hydrogen phosphate ion. So the solution has a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. That would mean that we have a buffer system based on the second dissociation of H3PO4. Because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2- (that's the second dissociation, with Ka2 = 6.2e-8), or it can gain a proton to become H3PO4.

So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation might be applicable here. Because we have a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-), the pH of the solution can be determined using the pKa2, and then we can find the concentration of PO4^3- from there.

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-.

So, how do we find the concentration of PO4^3- in this buffer solution?

Hmm. Let's outline the steps I think I need to take.

1. Calculate the moles of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O in the solution.

2. Find out the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.

3. Use the buffer equation to find the pH of the solution.

4. Then, determine the concentration of PO4^3- using the Ka3 value.

Wait, but wait. Because PO4^3- is the deprotonated form of HPO4^2-, right? So, the third dissociation of H3PO4 is HPO4^2- ⇌ PO4^3- + H+.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small, so the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low compared to HPO4^2-.

So, given that, perhaps we can calculate the pH first using the buffer from H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and then use that pH to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Let me proceed step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the moles of each salt.

For KH2PO4: Molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. We have 1.00 g.

Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007346 mol.

So, moles of H2PO4^- = 0.007346 mol.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: Molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. 1.00 g.

Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005613 mol.

Each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2- and two moles of Na+ (but the Na+ is a spectator ion; we don't need it for the buffer calculation).

So, moles of HPO4^2- = 0.005613 mol.

Step 2: Find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The total volume is 0.2 L.

Concentration of H2PO4^- = 0.007346 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03673 M.

Concentration of HPO4^2- = 0.005613 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028065 M.

Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log ([base]/[acid]).

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- (since it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-). The base is HPO4^2-.

Wait, no. Wait, the buffer is H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base). So the pKa is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8.

So, pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) ≈ let me calculate that.

pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) ≈ log(6.2) + log(1e-8) → log(6.2) is about 0.7924, so 0.7924 - 8 = -7.2076. Wait, wait, no, wait: pKa is the negative log of Ka. So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8).

Calculating that: 6.2e-8 is 6.2 x 10^-8. log(6.2)=0.7924, so log(6.2e-8)=0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no: Wait, 6.2e-8 is 6.2 x10^-8, so log is log(6.2) + log(10^-8) = 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So the pKa is the negative of that, so pKa2 = 7.2076.

So, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

Plugging in the numbers:

pH = 7.2076 + log( (0.028065) / (0.03673) )

Calculate the ratio: 0.028065 / 0.03673 ≈ 0.7648.

Log(0.7648) is approximately let's see: log(0.7) is about -0.1549. Log(0.76) is approximately -0.1170. Let me calculate it more accurately.

Using a calculator, log(0.7648) = ln(0.7648)/ln(10) ≈ (-0.268)/(2.3026) ≈ -0.1164.

So pH ≈ 7.2076 - 0.1164 ≈ 7.0912.

So pH is about 7.091.

Step 4: Now, find the concentration of PO4^3-.

PO4^3- comes from the third dissociation of H3PO4:

HPO4^2- ⇌ PO4^3- + H+.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

At pH 7.091, we can find the concentration of H+ ions: [H+] = 10^(-pH) ≈ 10^(-7.091) ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

The reaction is:

HPO4^2- ⇌ PO4^3- + H+.

Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

We know Ka3 is 1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] is 0.028065 M, and [H+] is 8.23e-8 M.

Plugging in the numbers:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.23e-8.

Let me compute the numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = approx 5.0517e-14.

Then, dividing by 8.23e-8:

5.0517e-14 / 8.23e-8 = approx 6.136e-7.

Wait, that's about 6.14e-7 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is close. But I should double-check my calculations.

Wait, let me re-calculate the exact numbers.

First, let's re-calculate the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.028065 / 0.03673.

Let me compute that accurately:

0.028065 divided by 0.03673.

0.028065 / 0.03673 ≈ 0.7648.

Log(0.7648) is approximately -0.1164 as I thought.

So pH is 7.2076 -0.1164 = 7.0912.

[H+] = 10^(-7.0912) = let me calculate more accurately.

10^(-7.0912) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0912).

10^(-7) is 1e-7. 10^(-0.0912) is approximately 0.823. So [H+] is 8.23e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] =0.028065 M.

So numerator is 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 1.8 * 0.028065 = 0.050517 → 5.0517e-14.

Denominator is 8.23e-8.

So 5.0517e-14 / 8.23e-8 = (5.0517 / 8.23) * 1e-6.

5.0517 /8.23 ≈ 0.6136.

So 0.6136e-6 = 6.136e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 6.14e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is pretty close. But let me check if I made any calculation errors.

Wait, perhaps more precise calculations are needed.

Let me compute [HPO4^2-] more precisely.

Molar mass of Na2HPO4·2H2O: the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Molar mass of Na is 22.99, H is 1.008, P is 30.97, O is 16.00.

So Na2HPO4: 2*22.99 (Na) + 1*1.008 (H) + 30.97 (P) + 4*16.00 (O) = 45.98 +1.008 +30.97 +64 = 142.958 g/mol.

Then, adding 2 H2O: 2*(2*1.008 +16.00) = 2*(2.016 +16) = 2*(18.016) = 36.032 g.

So the molar mass is 142.958 +36.032 = 178.99 g/mol. Oh, wait the problem says the Mw is 177.99 g/mol. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me compute it accurately.

Wait, the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Na: 22.9905 *2 =45.981.

H: HPO4 has one H, plus 2*(H2O) has 2*2=4 H. So total H is 5, but in the formula, it's Na2HPO4·2H2O, so the H in Na2HPO4 is 1, and the 2 H2O contribute 4 H. So in total, 5 H atoms.

But for molar mass, we can compute each component:

Na2HPO4: Na (22.9905 *2) =45.981.

H: 1.008 *1 =1.008.

P:30.9738.

O: 4 *16.00 =64.00.

So, Na2HPO4: 45.981 +1.008 +30.9738 +64 = 142.9628 g/mol.

Then, 2 H2O: (2*(2*1.008 +16.00)) =2*(2.016 +16.00) =2*18.016=36.032.

So total Mw is 142.9628 +36.032 = 178.9948 g/mol. But the problem states Mw is 177.99 g/mol. Hmm, maybe the H2O is not included in the formula. Or perhaps I should just go with the given Mw of 177.99 g/mol.

Wait, the problem says Na2HPO4·2H2O has Mw 177.99 g/mol, so that's what I should use.

So, moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O is 1.00 g /177.99 g/mol = approx 0.005613 mol as before. So that's correct.

Now, for KH2PO4: 1.00 g /136.09 g/mol = 0.007346 mol.

So concentrations are correct.

Now, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [PO4^3-].

Wait, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] 

Ka3 is 1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] is 0.028065 M, [H+] is 8.23e-8 M.

So, 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = let's compute that.

1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 1.8 * 0.028065 = 0.050517 → 5.0517e-14.

Divided by 8.23e-8:

5.0517e-14 / 8.23e-8 = 5.0517 /8.23 → 5.0517 /8.23 ≈ 0.6136 → 0.6136e-6 = 6.136e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.14e-7 M.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 6.24e-7 M

Option B) 5.48e-7 M

Option D) 3.97e-7 M

Hmm. My calculation gives 6.136e-7, which is closest to option A (6.24e-7). But let's see if I made any miscalculations.

Wait another thing: when I computed [H+], I used pH =7.0912, so [H+]=1e-7.0912.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately without approximations.

Compute 10^(-7.0912):

It's 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0912).

10^(-7) is 1e-7.

Now, 10^(-0.0912) can be calculated using natural logarithm.

We can compute ln(10^0.0912) = 0.0912 * ln(10) ≈0.0912 * 2.3026 ≈0.210.

So, 10^0.0912 ≈ e^0.21 ≈1.233.

Wait, wait, no: Wait, no. Wait, 10^(-0.0912) is 1 / 10^0.0912.

Ah, so 10^0.0912 is about 1.233, so 10^(-0.0912) ≈ 0.811.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.811 = 8.11e-8 M.

Wait, that's more precise. So [H+] is approximately 8.11e-8 M.

So, let's recompute [PO4^3-]:

(1.8e-12 * 0.028065) /8.11e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.028065=5.0517e-14.

Denominator:8.11e-8.

So, 5.0517e-14 /8.11e-8 = (5.0517 /8.11) * 1e-6.

5.0517 /8.11 ≈0.6227 → 6.227e-7 M.

So that's approximately 6.23e-7 M, which matches option A (6.24e-7 M). So that's it.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the exact calculation:

5.0517e-14 divided by 8.11e-8.

5.0517e-14 / 8.11e-8 = (5.0517 /8.11) * 1e-6.

5.0517 ÷ 8.11:

Let's compute 8.11 × 0.622 = 5.049, which is close to 5.0517. So 0.622 is about right. So 0.622e-6 =6.22e-7.

So, that's 6.22e-7 M, which is very close to option A, 6.24e-7 M.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact value would be 6.23e-7, which would round to 6.24e-7, so option A is correct.

Wait, but wait. Another thing to consider: the total concentration of orthophosphate (PO4^3-) is determined by the third dissociation. But another approach is to consider that in solution, PO4^3- comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but perhaps another factor is the dilution. Are the moles correct?

Wait, the solution volume is 0.2 liters, so 200 cm³. So the concentrations are correct as calculated.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the solution is not just a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but maybe the presence of both salts leads to a different pH? But I think the way I calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch is correct because the solution is a buffer made from H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the Henderson-Hasselbalch part.

I used pKa2 =7.2076, and the ratio of [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.7648.

So pH =7.2076 + log(0.7648) =7.2076 -0.1164=7.0912.

Yes, that's correct.

So, in that case, the [PO4^3-] is around 6.2e-7 M, so option A.

But wait, another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the concentration of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- can affect the third dissociation.

Wait, but in this case, the third dissociation is HPO4^2- ⇌ PO4^3- + H+.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So at pH 7.09, which is slightly basic, the H+ is 8.11e-8.

So, the expression is [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/ [H+].

Another way to think about this is using the expression:

PO4^3- concentration = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

So, I think the calculation is correct.

So, the answer should be A) 6.24e-7 M.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and apply the relevant equilibrium expressions.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each salt
- **KH₂PO₄**:  
  Molar mass = 136.09 g/mol  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007346 \, \text{mol} \)  
  Dissociates into \( \text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- \), so moles of \( \text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- = 0.007346 \, \text{mol} \).

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  Molar mass = 177.99 g/mol  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005613 \, \text{mol} \)  
  Dissociates into \( \text{HPO}_4^{2-} \), so moles of \( \text{HPO}_4^{2-} = 0.005613 \, \text{mol} \).

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations of \( \text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- \) and \( \text{HPO}_4^{2-} \)
The total volume of the solution is \( 200.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.2 \, \text{L} \).

- \( [\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-] = \frac{0.007346 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.03673 \, \text{M} \)  
- \( [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}] = \frac{0.005613 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.028065 \, \text{M} \).

### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH
The buffer system consists of \( \text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- \) (acid) and \( \text{HPO}_4^{2-} \) (base), with \( \text{Ka}_2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \).  
The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]} \right)
\]
- \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.2076 \).  
- Ratio \( \frac{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-]} = \frac{0.028065}{0.03673} \approx 0.7648 \).  
- \( \log(0.7648) \approx -0.1164 \).  

Thus:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.2076 - 0.1164 \approx 7.0912
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( [\text{PO}_4^{3-}] \)
The third dissociation of phosphate is:  
\[
\text{HPO}_4^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{PO}_4^{3-} + \text{H}^+
\]
The equilibrium constant is \( \text{Ka}_3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \). The expression for \( \text{Ka}_3 \) is:  
\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{PO}_4^{3-}][\text{H}^+]}{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}
\]
Rearranging for \( [\text{PO}_4^{3-}] \):  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}^+]}
\]
- \( [\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.0912} \approx 8.11 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M} \).  
- Substituting values:  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028065)}{8.11 \times 10^{-8}}
\]
- Numerator: \( 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \cdot 0.028065 \approx 5.0517 \times 10^{-14} \).  
- Denominator: \( 8.11 \times 10^{-8} \).  
- \( [\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{5.0517 \times 10^{-14}}{8.11 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.23 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \).

### Final Answer
The concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately \( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
