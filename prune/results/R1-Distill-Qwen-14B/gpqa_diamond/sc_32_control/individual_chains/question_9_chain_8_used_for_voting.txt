Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me about symmetry in molecules. Hmm, I need to figure out which of the given molecules has C3H symmetry. I'm a bit rusty on my group theory, but let's try to break this down step by step.

First, I should remember what C3H symmetry means. From what I recall, C3H is a type of symmetry operation. The 'C' stands for 'cyclic', and the subscript 3 means it's a three-fold rotation. The 'H' stands for 'horizontal', which refers to the plane of symmetry. So, a molecule with C3H symmetry can be rotated 120 degrees around a certain axis, and there's a horizontal mirror plane that bisects the structure.

Let me think about each of the options provided. The options are four different molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone, and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. The options are labeled A to D, with each option being one of these molecules.

Alright, I'll go through each one.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. Triisopropyl borate has the formula (i-Pr)3BO. I remember that triisopropyl borane has a trigonal planar structure around the boron atom because boron typically has three bonds. So in triisopropyl borate, the boron is at the center with three identical isopropyl groups attached. Wait, but does this structure have a plane of symmetry? Hmm. If the three isopropyl groups are identical, the molecule should have a three-fold rotational axis. But for C3H symmetry, there needs to be a horizontal mirror plane as well. Let me visualize it. If you rotate the molecule 120 degrees around an axis perpendicular to the plane (like the boron atom's plane), the molecule would look the same. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? The mirror plane would cut through the boron atom and maybe some of the substituents. Wait, each isopropyl group is symmetric. So, does that mean that each substituent is on the same plane? I think triisopropyl borate has a plane of symmetry that's perpendicular to the three-fold axis. So perhaps it does have C3H symmetry. Or maybe it's C3V, which is a different type of symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe it's D3h symmetry, which includes a horizontal mirror plane. But wait, the question is about C3H. I'm not entirely sure, so I'll hold that thought and check the other options.

Option D is quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, specifically a tricyclic compound with a bridge structure. Its structure is a norbornane derivative, I think. Wait, norbornane has a bicyclo[2.2.1] structure. Quinuclidine is similar but with a bridge. Quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2] structure, making it quite symmetric. I remember that quinuclidine has a three-fold axis of symmetry. Let me think about its symmetry. If I rotate it 120 degrees, does it look the same? The molecule has a central nitrogen, and three equivalent bridges coming off. So, rotating it 120 degrees around the central axis should leave it unchanged. Now, does it have a mirror plane? I think quinuclidine has a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule, perhaps through the nitrogen atom and some of the bridge structures. So if the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then it would have C3H symmetry. So quinuclidine might be the correct answer.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. That's a mouthful. Let's try to parse the structure. It's a trifuran, which means three furan rings connected in some way. The substituents are in specific positions. The numbering suggests how the rings are fused. Hmm, but I'm not too familiar with this compound. Maybe it's a more complex structure with multiple ring fusions. I'm not sure about its symmetry. But since it's a benzo-fused system, perhaps it's similar to other polycyclic compounds. Alternatively, I'm not sure if it has a three-fold symmetry. Maybe it's more likely to have a higher symmetry, like D3h or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it doesn't have a three-fold axis, so it might not have C3H.

Option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. This looks like another polycyclic compound, perhaps similar to option B but with triphenylene groups. Triphenylene is a triphenylene group, which is a fused benzene ring structure. So, this molecule probably has three phenyl groups attached to a central trifuran structure. Now, if the trifuran is symmetrically attached with three phenyl groups, maybe the molecule has a three-fold axis. Let me imagine: if each phenyl is in a position that can be rotated 120 degrees around the central axis, and there's a horizontal mirror plane cutting through the center, then it would have C3H symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps it has higher symmetry.

Wait, but I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again: C3H symmetry requires the presence of a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (H). So the molecule must look the same after a 120-degree rotation and must be symmetric with respect to a horizontal plane.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: triisopropyl borate. Structure is three identical substituents around a central atom. So it's trigonal planar. Does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the molecule is planar, then a plane through the central atom (perpendicular to the plane) would be a vertical mirror plane. Wait, but the H in C3H refers to a horizontal mirror plane, which is parallel to the principal rotation axis. Wait, I might be getting this wrong.

Wait, the classification of symmetry: C3 is a three-fold rotation axis. H is a horizontal mirror plane, which is a plane perpendicular to the principal rotation axis (so a vertical plane for C3 axis). Wait, no. No, the principal rotation axis is C3, which is along, say, the z-axis. A horizontal mirror plane would be in the x-y plane. Wait, no, a horizontal mirror plane would be a plane that's perpendicular to the rotation axis (so for C3 along z, the mirror plane would be the x-y plane). So, a molecule with C3H symmetry would have a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, but how does that work? For example, benzene has a six-fold rotation axis and multiple mirror planes. But for C3H, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical with a three-fold axis and a mirror plane that's horizontal.

Another approach: let's think about the point group of each molecule.

Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar geometry. The point group is D3h. D3h has a three-fold rotation axis, three mirror planes, and a horizontal mirror plane. So yes, it does have a horizontal mirror plane, so it would have C3H symmetry as part of the D3h group. So triisopropyl borate (option C) has C3H symmetry.

Quinuclidine, I'm not so sure. Quinuclidine has a point group of C3. Because it's a tricyclic structure with a three-fold axis but no mirror planes. Or does it? Wait, quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. Let me imagine the structure: it has a central nitrogen atom, and three methylene bridges connected to it. If I rotate the molecule 120 degrees, it should look the same. Does it have any mirror planes? I think it does have a plane of symmetry that includes the nitrogen and two of the bridges. Wait, but that's a vertical mirror plane, not horizontal. So perhaps the point group is D3h, which would have a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me correct. The point group for quinuclidine is actually D3h. Because it has a three-fold rotation axis, a horizontal mirror plane, and other symmetry elements. So if that's the case, then it would have C3H symmetry.

Wait, but then both options C and D could have C3H? But that can't be the case because the question says only one is correct. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe triisopropyl borate's point group is D3h, which includes a horizontal mirror plane (H), so it does have C3H. Quinuclidine might be D3h as well. So how do I decide between them?

Wait, perhaps I should think about each molecule's structure again.

Triisopropyl borate has three identical isopropyl groups attached to a central boron. The structure is trigonal planar, so the point group is D3h. Therefore, it has a horizontal mirror plane.

Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. Let's imagine the structure: a bridgehead nitrogen. The molecule is symmetric with three identical bridges. The point group is D3h because it has a three-fold axis, a horizontal mirror plane, and other planes. So, quinuclidine also has C3H symmetry.

Hmm, so now I'm getting confused because two options might have C3H symmetry. But according to the question, only one option is correct.

Wait, let me reconsider. The question asks which molecule has C3H symmetry. But in group theory, C3H is part of a larger group. So perhaps both option C and D have C3H, but the question is more about whether the molecule has at least C3H symmetry.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think about the point groups:

- D3h has a three-fold axis, a horizontal mirror plane, and others. So it includes C3H as a symmetry operation.

- C3h is a different point group. C3h includes a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, perhaps if a molecule's point group includes C3h, it would have C3H symmetry.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the exact definitions. Maybe another approach would be better. Let's think about which of the options are known for having C3H symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate is a molecule with three identical substituents around a central atom, which is trigonal planar. So, it's highly symmetric. It definitely has D3h symmetry, which includes C3H. So option C is a contender.

Quinuclidine, as I thought earlier, has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So its point group is D3h as well. So perhaps both options C and D have C3H symmetry. But that can't be the case because the question gives four options and expects one answer.

Wait, perhaps I should look back at the options. The question lists four options, labeled A, B, C, D. The options are:

A) triphenyleno...hexaone

B) benzo...hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So the possible answers are A, B, C, D.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether triisopropyl borate has a horizontal mirror plane. So, considering the three isopropyl groups arranged symmetrically around the boron, which is in the center. The molecule is planar, so the plane of the boron and the substituents is the principal plane. So, a horizontal mirror plane would be a plane that's perpendicular to the rotation axis. Wait, no, the rotation axis is along the normal of the plane. So the three-fold rotation axis is perpendicular to the plane. So, a horizontal mirror plane would be the plane itself. Wait, the plane of the molecule is the horizontal plane, and it would serve as a mirror plane. So that would be a vertical mirror plane in this case? No, wait, I'm getting confused between the axes.

Wait, perhaps the three-fold rotation axis is perpendicular to the molecular plane. So, a plane that is the molecular plane would be a horizontal plane. So, a horizontal mirror plane would be the same as the molecular plane, which would reflect the molecule onto itself. So, yes, triisopropyl borate has such a mirror plane. So it has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

Quinuclidine, on the other hand, has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane as well. So both have C3H symmetry. But that can't be right because the question expects one correct answer.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the point groups. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: maybe only one of them has a three-fold axis with a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, triisopropyl borate is planar, so the three-fold rotation is in the plane. The mirror plane is the same as the plane of the molecule. So any rotation would be in the same plane, and the mirror plane is the same as the plane. So the symmetry elements are present.

Quinuclidine, being a three-dimensional molecule, has a three-fold rotation axis that's not in the same plane as any mirror plane. Its mirror planes might be vertical, not horizontal.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about the point group of quinuclidine. Quinuclidine's structure is a norbornane derivative, but more specifically, it's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with an NH group. The molecule has a three-fold axis through the nitrogen. So, any rotation of 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? A horizontal mirror plane would be one that's perpendicular to the three-fold axis. Since the three-fold axis is vertical (assuming the molecule stands on the nitrogen), a horizontal plane would be the plane of the paper. So, reflecting across that plane would leave the molecule unchanged. Does quinuclidine have such a plane?

Yes, I think it does. So quinuclidine would have a horizontal mirror plane. So in that case, both triisopropyl borate and quinuclidine have C3H symmetry. But that can't be right because the options only allow one correct choice.

Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken about quinuclidine's symmetry. Maybe it doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane. Let me imagine the structure. The molecule is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with a nitrogen atom. So the three bridges are symmetric. If I imagine looking along the three-fold axis (through the nitrogen), the molecule would look like a three-pointed star. Each bridge is equivalent. So, a horizontal mirror plane would cut through the nitrogen and reflect the molecule. Does that match the structure?

Wait, perhaps the horizontal mirror plane would bisect the molecule through the nitrogen and the opposite side. So, yes, it would have that mirror plane. So quinuclidine does have a horizontal mirror plane.

Hmm, so both options C and D seem to have C3H symmetry. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. Alternatively, perhaps one of them doesn't have it.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the other options as well. Let's see.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

This looks like a compound with three fused furan rings with a benzene ring attached. Wait, the name suggests a benzo-fused structure. Benzo implies a six-membered ring attached. So, perhaps it's a three-fused furan system with a benzene ring. Not sure about the symmetry here. Would the molecule have a three-fold axis? Maybe not, because the benzo group would break the three-fold symmetry. So perhaps this molecule has lower symmetry, maybe D3, but not D3h. So it might not have a horizontal mirror plane.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Triphenylene is a triphenylene group, which is a structure where three benzene rings are fused in a linear fashion. So, the molecule would have three phenyl groups attached to a trifuran. But attaching three phenyl groups symmetrically might create a three-fold axis. If the trifuran is symmetrically substituted with three phenyl groups, then perhaps the molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. But I'm not sure if triphenylene itself is symmetric enough to contribute to that.

Wait, triphenylene is a [p,p,p] tricyclic system, right? So it's symmetric in a certain way. If the three phenyl groups are attached symmetrically in the trifuran, then the overall molecule might have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So perhaps option A has C3H symmetry.

But that's getting complicated. Let me think again.

The question is to find which molecule has C3H symmetry, which requires a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

From what I recall, triisopropyl borate is a common example of a molecule with D3h symmetry, which includes C3H.

Quinuclidine, I think, also has D3h symmetry. So both options C and D would have C3H symmetry, which can't be the case because the question expects one correct answer. But wait, perhaps I'm wrong about quinuclidine's symmetry.

Wait, perhaps I should look it up. Wait, I can't actually look things up, I have to rely on my memory.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is quinuclidine. Because another example often given for C3H is triphenylamine or similar structures, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: maybe the question is about whether the molecule has a three-fold axis of rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So, which of these molecules fits that.

Triisopropyl borate (option C) has three identical substituents arranged in a trigonal planar fashion. So, it definitely has a three-fold rotation axis, and a horizontal mirror plane (the plane of the molecule itself). So yes, it has C3H symmetry.

Quinuclidine (option D) has a three-fold axis, but does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm, I think it does. So both have C3H. But the question lists four options, with only one correct answer. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I confused D3h with C3H. Let me think: C3H is a point group that includes a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. D3h is a higher symmetry group that includes C3H along with other elements like vertical mirror planes and a center of inversion.

So, if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it would have C3H as a subset. So both C and D would have C3H. But the question might be which one specifically has a three-fold rotation with a horizontal mirror plane, regardless of other symmetry elements.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options given. The question lists four options, and only one is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is option D, quinuclidine.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane. Because if the three substituents are all in the same plane, then the plane itself is the mirror plane. So, if you flip the molecule over that plane, it would look the same. So yes, triisopropyl borate has a horizontal mirror plane.

But if quinuclidine's horizontal mirror plane would be in the same plane as the nitrogen and the molecule, perhaps it's not the case.

Wait, maybe quinuclidine's point group is C3, which has a three-fold rotation but no mirror plane. But that doesn't make sense because I thought it had D3h symmetry.

I'm getting more confused. Let me try to think about the point groups again.

Point group D3h has the following symmetry elements: a three-fold axis (C3), a horizontal mirror plane (H), three vertical mirror planes (each perpendicular to the C3 axis and passing through a pair of atoms), and inversion centers if present. So, if a molecule has D3h symmetry, then yes, it has a horizontal mirror plane.

But which of the options have D3h?

Triisopropyl borate is trigonal planar with three identical substituents. So, yes, it has D3h symmetry.

Quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with a nitrogen. The molecule is symmetric with a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, it also has D3h symmetry.

Wait, now I'm really stuck because both options C and D have D3h symmetry, which includes C3H. But the question's options only allow one correct answer. So perhaps one of them is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the question is about whether the molecule has a three-fold axis in a particular direction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the other options. Let's check what the other options' structures are.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

This structure has a benzene ring fused to a trifuran system. The numbering suggests that the benzene is fused in a way that each bridge is connected. So, the molecule would have a six-membered ring fused with a three-membered ring? Wait, no, trifuran is a three-fused furan system. So, the benzo substitution would be in specific positions. But whether it has a three-fold symmetry is unclear. Probably, the benzene substitution would disrupt the three-fold symmetry, making the molecule have lower symmetry, perhaps C3 but without a mirror plane.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Triphenylene is a triphenylene group, which is a linear fusion of three benzene rings. So, the molecule would have three phenyl groups attached to the trifuran. If the three phenyl groups are in equivalent positions, then the molecule would have a three-fold axis and perhaps a horizontal mirror plane. So, it's possible that option A has C3H symmetry as well.

But this is getting too complicated. Perhaps the correct answer is option C, triisopropyl borate. Because it's a simpler structure and a classic example of a molecule with D3h symmetry, which includes C3H.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for a molecule with a three-fold axis that is horizontal. But that's unlikely because the C3H refers to the combination of a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, another angle: for a molecule to have C3H symmetry, it needs to have a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, for example, a molecule that can be rotated 120 degrees and also reflected in a horizontal plane would have C3H.

So, triisopropyl borate definitely has D3h symmetry, so it would have C3H. Quinuclidine, if it has D3h, would also have C3H. So, perhaps the answer is option C.

But wait, perhaps quinuclidine's point group is actually C3v, which would include a three-fold rotation and some vertical mirror planes but not a horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane. Let me think about its structure. If I imagine the molecule, it has a central nitrogen and three bridges. If I reflect it across a horizontal plane, would it look the same? Maybe not, because the nitrogen is in a specific position. So perhaps quinuclidine does not have a horizontal mirror plane, making its point group C3v instead of D3h.

If that's the case, then option C, triisopropyl borate, is the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about quinuclidine's symmetry. I think I'm getting stuck here and need to make a decision.

So, to sum up:

- Triisopropyl borate (option C) has D3h symmetry, so it has C3H.

- Quinuclidine (option D) may have C3v symmetry, which doesn't include a horizontal mirror plane, so it wouldn't have C3H.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about quinuclidine. Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine's point group is C3, which includes only a three-fold rotation, without any mirror planes.

In that case, option C would be the correct answer.

So, after this lengthy thinking, I think the correct answer is option C, triisopropyl borate.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which molecule has **C₃H symmetry**, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry elements. **C₃H symmetry** requires a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (H). Here's the breakdown:

---

### **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
This molecule consists of a trifuran system fused with three phenyl groups. While the trifuran core may allow for a three-fold rotational axis, the phenyl groups are likely arranged in a way that disrupts the symmetry. Additionally, there is no clear horizontal mirror plane that would reflect the molecule onto itself. Thus, this molecule does not exhibit **C₃H symmetry**.

---

### **Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
This molecule features a benzo-fused trifuran system. The benzene ring introduces asymmetry, breaking the three-fold rotational symmetry. Furthermore, there is no horizontal mirror plane that would bisect the molecule. Therefore, this molecule does not have **C₃H symmetry**.

---

### **Option C: Triisopropyl Borate**
Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar geometry with three identical isopropyl groups attached to a central boron atom. The molecule has a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (H), which is the plane of the molecule itself. This makes triisopropyl borate a classic example of a molecule with **D₃h symmetry**, which includes **C₃H symmetry**. Thus, this molecule satisfies the criteria.

---

### **Option D: Quinuclidine**
Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative with a nitrogen atom at the bridgehead. It has a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) but lacks a horizontal mirror plane. The nitrogen atom and the three-dimensional arrangement of the molecule prevent reflection across a horizontal plane that would leave the structure unchanged. Therefore, quinuclidine does not exhibit **C₃H symmetry**.

---

### **Conclusion**
Among the given options, **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) is the only molecule that exhibits **C₃H symmetry** due to its three-fold rotational axis and horizontal mirror plane.

**Answer: C**
