Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I think I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution from my studies. Let me try to break this down.

So the question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So I can probably use the Boltzmann equation here.

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), right? Here, g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy difference ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote the two energy levels as i and j. Suppose E_i is the higher energy level. So the ratio of the populations would be n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, but the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So for star_1, n_i is twice n_j? Or wait, maybe the ratio is twice. Let me clarify.

Wait, the problem states that the excitation is twice as much. So for star_1, the number of atoms in the excited state (let's say state i) compared to the ground state (j) is twice that of star_2. So for star_1, n_i1 / n_j1 = 2 * (n_i2 / n_j2). Or maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, no, perhaps it's simpler. For each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star_1, the ratio is (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star_2, it's (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But wait, the problem says that the excitation is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So maybe (n_i1 / n_j1) = 2 * (n_i2 / n_j2). Assuming g_i and g_j are the same for both stars? Because the same element, same energy levels, so g_i and g_j would be the same for both stars. So g1/g2 cancels out when taking the ratio.

So let me write the ratios.

For star_1: (n_i1 / n_j1) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: (n_i2 / n_j2) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Given that (n_i1 / n_j1) = 2 * (n_i2 / n_j2) = 2 * [exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

So substituting:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Hmm, let's take natural logarithm on both sides.

ln( exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ) = ln( 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Simplify left side: -ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + ln( exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Which is: -ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Let me rearrange this equation.

Bring the ΔE terms to one side.

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ -1/T1 + 1/T2 ] = ln(2)

Which can be written as ΔE/(k) ( (T2 - T1) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, let me see. Let me factor the terms:

-1/T1 + 1/T2 = ( - T2 + T1 ) / (T1 T2) ) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So plugging back in:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, okay, so the equation becomes:

(ΔE (T1 - T2)) / (k T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but let me check the options. The options are in terms of ln(2) equal to some expression involving T1 and T2.

Looking at the options:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But wait, in my equation, it's (ΔE (T1 - T2)) / (k T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, the given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. Let me check what k is. Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, wait a second! So ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE = k * (1 K) because 1.38e-23 J = (1.38e-23 J/K) * (1 K). So ΔE = k * T_0, where T_0 is 1 K. Interesting.

So with ΔE = k * (1 K), substituting into the equation:

( (k * 1 K) (T1 - T2) ) ) / (k T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

The k cancels out:

(1 K * (T1 - T2)) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2)

So,

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / 1 K * something? Wait, no, because the units for K would be in the numerator, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe not. Let's see: The equation is (ΔE (T1-T2)) / (k T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But since ΔE = k * 1 K, substituting:

(k*1 K (T1-T2)) / (k T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

The k cancels:

(1 K (T1 - T2)) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but K is Kelvin, which is a unit of temperature. So the left side is (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) multiplied by K. But the right side is unitless because ln(2) is unitless.

Wait, that can't be right. There's a problem here because the units don't balance. Let me think again.

Wait, no, wait. Because ΔE has units of J, which is kg·m²/s². And k has units J/K, so k*T has units J. So ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So when I write ΔE = k * T_0, T_0 must be in Kelvin.

So for ΔE = k * T_0,

T_0 = ΔE / k = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So that's correct.

So substituting back into the equation:

(ΔE (T1 - T2)) / (k T1 T2) ) = ln(2) → (k * 1 K (T1-T2)) / (k T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2) → (1 K (T1-T2)) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, the left side has units of K multiplied by (T1-T2) (unit K) divided by (T1 T2) (unit K²). So the entire left side would have units of (K²) / K² → unitless. Oh, because 1 K * (T1-T2) is K², and denominator is K². So yes, the units work out.

So,

( (T1 - T2) ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2) / 1 K ? Wait no, because 1 K is in numerator. Wait, let me re-express the equation:

After substitution, (1 K) * (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but that would mean that the left side has units of K (from the 1 K) multiplied by (K²)/(K²) )? No, wait. (T1 - T2) is K, so (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) is (K) / (K * K) ) → 1/K.

Then 1 K * (1/K) ) → unitless, which matches the right side, ln(2), which is unitless.

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / (1 K) * K → No, wait, the equation after substitution is:

(1 K * (T1 - T2)) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which is:

( (T1-T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / (1 K) → No, wait, let me re-express.

Wait, no, the equation is (1 K) * (T1-T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2). So,

( (T1 - T2) ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2) / (1 K) → which would imply units of 1/K on the right. But ln(2) is unitless, so 1 K multiplied by something with units 1/K would give unitless.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the units. Let me just proceed with the algebra.

So, from earlier, we have:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / (1 K) → which can't be right because ln(2) is unitless. So perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, perhaps a different approach. Let me go back.

We had:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Take the natural log of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Rearranging:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

ΔE/(k) ( ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2)

So,

ΔE (T1 - T2) / (k T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2)

Again, since ΔE = k * (1 K),

Substituting, we get:

(k * 1 K) (T1 - T2) / (k T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

The k's cancel:

1 K (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but ln(2) is dimensionless, so the left side must be dimensionless. Let me see the units:

1 K is Kelvin. (T1-T2) is in K. T1 and T2 are in K, so T1 T2 is K^2.

So,

( 1 K * K ) / ( K^2 ) → (K^2) / (K^2) ) → dimensionless. So that's correct.

So,

( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2) / (1 K) → No, wait, no. Because 1 K is multiplied by (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) which is (K) / (K^2) ) → 1/K.

Wait, so 1 K * (1/K) ) → unitless. So equation is:

(1 K) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

Which is:

( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / (1 K) → No, that can't be right because units don't match.

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed without units for now.

So,

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / (ΔE/k )

Wait, because from the equation:

ΔE (T1-T2) / (k T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So,

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * k / ΔE

But since ΔE = k * (1 K), then k/ΔE = 1/(1 K) → 1/K.

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (1/K) * K → because 1 K multiplied by 1/K is 1.

Wait, maybe I'm getting tangled in the units. Let me think without units for a moment.

We have:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (k) / ΔE

But since ΔE = k * T_0, where T_0 = 1 K,

Then,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * k / (k T_0) ) → T_0 is 1 K,

Which simplifies to (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / T_0

But T_0 is 1 K, so,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (1 K) → Wait, no, that's not right because ln(2) is unitless and 1 K is a unit.

Wait, maybe I should just focus on the equation without units. Let me restate:

We have:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (ln(2)) * (k) / ΔE

But ΔE = k * T_0 → T_0 = ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (ln(2)) * (k) / (k * T_0) ) = (ln(2)) / T_0

Because k cancels.

But T_0 is 1 K, so:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) / 1 → which is ln(2).

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Which matches exactly what we have here.

So the correct equation is D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann distribution is used to relate the population ratios of atoms in different energy levels to temperature. The given energy difference between the energy levels is ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J, and Boltzmann's constant is k = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K.

The Boltzmann distribution equation is:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right)
\]

For star_1 and star_2, the ratio of excited to ground state populations is:

\[
\frac{n_{i1}}{n_{j1}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad \frac{n_{i2}}{n_{j2}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, so:

\[
\frac{n_{i1}}{n_{j1}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{i2}}{n_{j2}}
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann factors:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2)
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
\frac{\Delta E (T_1 - T_2)}{k T_1 T_2} = \ln(2)
\]

Since ΔE = k \cdot T₀, where T₀ = 1 K (because ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J and k = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K), substitute ΔE = k \cdot T₀:

\[
\frac{k \cdot T₀ (T_1 - T_2)}{k T_1 T_2} = \ln(2)
\]

The k terms cancel:

\[
\frac{T₀ (T_1 - T_2)}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2)
\]

Since T₀ = 1 K, this simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2)
\]

This matches option D, which states:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

Thus, the correct equation is:

**Answer: D**
