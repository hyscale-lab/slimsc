Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Let me try to think it through. Hmm, the question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The K for Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The K for this reaction is given as 5e10, which is a really large number, so the complex is very stable.

Since the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, that means the solution has 0.02 M of this complex. The question is asking for [Ca²+], which is the free calcium ion concentration.

In such a complexation equilibrium, the total concentration of the complex (let's call it [CaEDTA^2-]) is equal to the concentration of Ca²+ that's complexed. But wait, because EDTA is in excess, the [EDTA] is much higher than [Ca²+], so most of the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex. Oh wait, but the problem states it's a stoichiometric solution. So, stoichiometric means that the amounts are exactly in the ratio. So the initial concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA would have been such that all the Ca²+ forms the complex. Wait, no. Wait, what is stoichiometric here?

Wait, the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Since the complex is 1:1 between Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, the total EDTA in solution is much higher, but in a stoichiometric solution, maybe the initial amounts are such that they form the complex without excess. Wait, not sure.

But regardless, the approach should be to use the formation constant. The formation constant Kf is given. For the reaction Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2-, Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Or wait, sometimes formation constants are given as K = [ML]/([M][L]), where ML is the complex.

So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

But wait, in solution, the concentration of EDTA isn't just [EDTA^4-], because EDTA can exist in multiple protonated forms. But the problem states that the pH is ideal, so perhaps the fraction of EDTA in the form EDTA^4- is 1, so alpha (α) is 1. So, [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the total EDTA concentration.

But wait, the solution's pH is ideal. I'm not entirely sure about this, but I think in such cases, we can assume that the EDTA is mostly in the Y^4- form, so the alpha is 1, making [EDTA^4-] = [EDTA]_total.

Wait, but in reality, EDTA has different protonated forms. At a certain pH, the dominant species is Y^4-. So if the pH is optimal, perhaps it's in a buffer where this is the case. So, I can proceed under that assumption.

So, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me write down the variables:

Let [Ca²+] = x.

Since the complex is 0.02 M, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

The EDTA concentration, [EDTA^4-], would be the total EDTA minus that used in the complex. Wait, but in a stoichiometric solution, I think the amount of EDTA is just enough to form the complex with all the Ca²+. Wait, but in that case, the initial concentrations would be Ca²+ and EDTA at 0.02 M each, but they form 0.02 M complex. So, the EDTA in solution would be in excess? Or wait, no—it's a 1:1 complex, so if the solution is stoichiometric, the EDTA is added in exactly the same amount as Ca²+ to form the complex. But that would imply that all the Ca²+ is complexed, leaving no free Ca²+ or EDTA. But that can't be the case because the K is so high, but maybe some remains.

Wait, no. Because the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the complex. That would mean that the sum of the Ca²+ and EDTA in their free forms plus the complex equals 0.02 M for the complex. But wait, no; the total EDTA would be the sum of [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-], and same for Ca. Because each Ca²+ is part of the complex. So [Ca²+ free] is x, and the complex is 0.02 M, so the total Ca is 0.02 + x ≈ 0.02 M, since x is probably very small. Similarly, the total EDTA is [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] = [EDTA]_total. But in a stoichiometric solution, I think [CaEDTA^2-] = [Ca²+ total] = 0.02 M, assuming all Ca is complexed, but that can't be because K is finite but large.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the problem differently. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. The formation constant K is given as 5e10. So, Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

But EDTA is present in excess, so [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the total EDTA concentration, which is much larger than [Ca²+]. So, perhaps [EDTA^4-] is about the same as the total EDTA concentration, which is much higher than [Ca²+], so [EDTA^4-] ≈ C_EDTA_total.

Wait, but I don't know the total EDTA concentration. Hmm. Wait, but if the solution is stoichiometric, that might mean that [EDTA]_total is equal to [CaEDTA^2-], right? Because each Ca uses one EDTA. So [EDTA]_total = [CaEDTA^2-] + [EDTA^4-]. But if the solution is stoichiometric, perhaps [EDTA^4-] is negligible compared to [CaEDTA^2-], but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is made such that the concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M, and the solution is such that the EDTA is in excess, so [EDTA^4-] is much larger than [Ca²+]. So, I can approximate [EDTA^4-] as being approximately [EDTA]_total, which is much larger than [Ca²+] and [CaEDTA], perhaps. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the solution is just 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, and the EDTA is in such excess that [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the concentration of EDTA in solution, which is not given. Hmm. That complicates things. But perhaps, since K is so large, the EDTA is in excess, so [EDTA^4-] is effectively a constant, and thus [Ca²+] can be found using the K expression.

Wait, let me think. The Kf is [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]) = 5e10.

If [CaEDTA] is 0.02 M, and [EDTA] is much larger than [Ca²+], then [EDTA] ≈ [EDTA]_total.

But without knowing [EDTA]_total, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is such that all the Ca²+ is in the complex, and the EDTA is in excess. But that's not possible because then [Ca²+] would be zero, which isn't the case. So, perhaps the concentration of [EDTA^4-] is much larger than [Ca²+], so [EDTA^4-] ≈ [EDTA]_total, but I don't know its value.

Wait, maybe there's another approach. Let me consider that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M. The total EDTA in solution is [EDTA]_total = [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-]. Similarly, the total calcium is [Ca²+]_total = x + [CaEDTA] = x + 0.02, where x is the free [Ca²+].

But without knowing the total EDTA or calcium concentrations, I can't proceed that way. Wait, perhaps the solution is made by adding the right amounts so that the complex is 0.02 M, and the EDTA is in such excess that [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to [EDTA]_total, which is much larger than [Ca²+].

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is made by dissolving 0.02 moles of Ca-EDTA in a liter. Then, the [CaEDTA] is 0.02 M. So, the EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex? No, that's not right because EDTA is usually added in excess when forming complexes.

Wait, maybe I should approach it by considering that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, which comes from the initial addition. So, the [CaEDTA] is 0.02 M.

The K expression is Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

Rearranging: [Ca²+] = [CaEDTA]/(Kf * [EDTA^4-]).

But I don't know [EDTA^4-]. Hmm. Wait, but in a solution where EDTA is in excess, [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the total EDTA concentration. But without knowing the total EDTA, I can't find [EDTA^4-].

Wait, perhaps in a stoichiometric solution, the concentration of EDTA is equal to the concentration of the complex. But that would imply that [EDTA^4-] is 0.02 M. Wait, but that might not be correct because the EDTA can't all be in the Y^4- form.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is such that the concentration of EDTA (as Y^4-) is much higher than the concentration of Ca²+, so [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the concentration of the complex, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the solution is prepared by adding exactly the same concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, so that they form the complex. But that would mean that [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are each 0.02 M, and the complex is 0.02 M. But that can't be right because the K is so large that the complex is favored, so the free [Ca²+] would be very low.

Wait, maybe I'm making this more complicated than it is. Let me consider that the solution has 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. Therefore, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the [Ca²+] is x. [EDTA^4-] is y.

Then, Kf = 0.02/(x * y) = 5e10.

So, x * y = 0.02 / 5e10 = 4e-13.

But without another equation, I can't find x. So, what else do I know? The stoichiometry is 1:1, so the total EDTA is y + 0.02. But I don't know y. Similarly, the total Ca is x + 0.02.

Wait, perhaps the solution is prepared by adding EDTA in excess, so that y is approximately a constant, say, [EDTA]_total = y ≈ C_EDTA. But without knowing that, perhaps the problem is designed in a way that the [EDTA^4-] can be assumed to be in excess, making x negligible compared to 0.02.

Wait, no, because if K is 5e10, which is very large, that means the complex is very stable, so x would be very small. So, perhaps x is negligible, and [EDTA^4-] ≈ [EDTA]_total.

But without knowing [EDTA]_total, I can't proceed numerically. Hmm, unless I make an assumption that [EDTA^4-] is much larger than [Ca²+], then [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the initial concentration of EDTA, which is in excess.

Wait, but the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So, perhaps the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- were both 0.02 M, and they form the complex, but that's not correct because the K is so high that nearly all of the Ca²+ would form the complex.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let's think differently. The K is given, so perhaps I can find [Ca²+] as sqrt( (0.02) / K ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let me write the expression again:

Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) =5e10.

So, [Ca²+] = [CaEDTA]/(5e10 * [EDTA^4-]).

But to find [Ca²+], I need [EDTA^4-], which I don't have. So perhaps I can express [EDTA^4-] in terms of [Ca²+] and [CaEDTA].

Wait, but I don't have another equation. Maybe I can assume that [EDTA^4-] is much larger than [Ca²+], so [EDTA^4-] is approximately [EDTA]_total. But without knowing [EDTA]_total, perhaps I'm stuck.

Wait, but the problem states that the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. So, perhaps the EDTA is present in such excess that [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the concentration of the complex, 0.02 M. But that would make [Ca²+] = (0.02) / (5e10 * 0.02) )= 1/(5e10) = 2e-11 M, which is not one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again: the formation constant Kf is given as 5e10. So, for the reaction Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2-, Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) =5e10.

Given that the solution has 0.02 M CaEDTA, so [CaEDTA] =0.02 M.

Let me denote [Ca²+] as x, and [EDTA^4-] as y.

So, 0.02/(x y) =5e10 → x y = 0.02/(5e10) = 4e-13.

But I need another equation. The total EDTA is y + 0.02 = [EDTA]_total.

Similarly, the total Ca is x + 0.02 = [Ca]_total.

But without knowing [EDTA]_total or [Ca]_total, I can't proceed. So perhaps the problem assumes that the EDTA is in such excess that y is approximately equal to [EDTA]_total, which is much larger than x. So, y ≈ [EDTA]_total, which is in excess, so x is negligible compared to 0.02.

Wait, but without knowing [EDTA]_total, perhaps the problem expects you to assume that all the EDTA is in the Y^4- form, and that the concentration is such that [Y^4-] is in excess, making [Ca²+] = [CaEDTA]/(Kf [Y^4-]).

But I'm stuck. Wait, perhaps the solution is to assume that [EDTA^4-] is much larger than [Ca²+], so that [EDTA^4-] is approximately the same as the concentration of the complex. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the [EDTA^4-] is so large that the term [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the concentration of the complex. No, that seems off.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed so that [EDTA^4-] is equal to the concentration of the complex. Then, [EDTA^4-] =0.02 M. Then, [Ca²+] = (0.02) / (5e10 * 0.02) )= 1/(5e10) = 2e-11 M. But that isn't one of the options. The options are 2e-2, 5e-3, 6.3e-7, 1e-2. So 2e-11 is not an option. So that approach must be incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Let me think again. Maybe the concentration of EDTA^4- is not 0.02 M, but something else.

Wait, perhaps the concentration of EDTA is much higher than the complex. So, [EDTA^4-] >> [Ca²+], so [EDTA^4-] is approximately [EDTA]_total.

But without knowing [EDTA]_total, I can't proceed. Wait, perhaps the initial solution has 0.02 M Ca²+ and 0.02 M EDTA^4-, which form the complex, but that would require that all Ca²+ is complexed, leaving no free Ca²+.

But that can't be right because K is finite. So, let me model it with that in mind. Suppose [Ca²+] is x, and [EDTA^4-] is y.

So, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But the total Ca is x + 0.02 = [Ca]_total. Similarly, the total EDTA is y + 0.02 = [EDTA]_total.

But without knowing [Ca]_total or [EDTA]_total, it's impossible to find x and y. So perhaps the problem is assuming that the EDTA is in such excess that [EDTA^4-] is much larger than [Ca²+], so [EDTA^4-] is approximately [EDTA]_total, which is much larger than 0.02 M. But without knowing [EDTA]_total, I can’t proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed such that the EDTA is present in such a high concentration that its concentration is approximately equal to the concentration of the complex. So, [EDTA^4-] = 0.02 M. Then, [Ca²+] = (0.02) / (5e10 * 0.02) )= 1/(5e10) = 2e-11 M. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed to have [EDTA^4-] = [Ca²+]. But that would make x = y.

So, substituting into the Kf expression: 0.02/(x^2) )=5e10 → x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) → x^2 =4e-13 → x= sqrt(4e-13)= 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, 2e-6.5 is 2 divided by 10^6.5, which is 10^6 is 1e6, 10^0.5 is about 3.16, so 10^6.5 = 3.16e6. So, 2 /3.16e6 = approx 6.3e-7. So, [Ca²+] is about 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That matches.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The equilibrium reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) is 0.02 M, let the free calcium ion concentration be \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x\) and the free EDTA concentration be \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = y\). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x \cdot y} = 5 \times 10^{10}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
x \cdot y = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

To solve for \(x\), we assume that the concentration of EDTA (\([\text{EDTA}^{4-}]\)) is much larger than the concentration of free calcium ions (\([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\)), meaning \(y \approx [\text{EDTA}_{\text{total}}]\). However, without explicit information about the total EDTA concentration, we proceed by assuming that the system is at equilibrium and \(y\) is approximately constant.

To simplify further, we assume that the concentration of free calcium ions is very small compared to the concentration of the complex, which is consistent with the large \(K_f\) value. Thus, we approximate \(y \approx 0.02\) M, the concentration of the complex. Substituting \(y = 0.02\) M into the equation:

\[
x \cdot 0.02 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{4 \times 10^{-13}}{0.02} = 2 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{M}
\]

This result does not match any of the provided options, so we revisit the assumption. Instead, we assume that the concentration of free EDTA is much larger than the concentration of free calcium ions, allowing us to approximate \(y \approx [\text{EDTA}_{\text{total}}]\). However, without explicit values, we solve for \(x\) directly by assuming \(x \cdot y = 4 \times 10^{-13}\) and solving for \(x\) under the assumption that \(x = y\). Substituting \(x = y\):

\[
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

This matches option C. Therefore, the concentration of calcium ions in the solution is:

\[
\boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}}
\]

Answer: C
