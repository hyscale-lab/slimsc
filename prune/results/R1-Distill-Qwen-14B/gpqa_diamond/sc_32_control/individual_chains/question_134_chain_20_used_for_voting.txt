Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some solutions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on enthalpy, but let me think through this step by step.

The problem says we're mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change is usually measured in kilojoules per mole, but the options here have kcal and kJ, so I need to pay attention to the units.

First, I should probably figure out how much acid and base we're dealing with in terms of moles. Because enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of reaction, I'll need to find out which is the limiting reactant.

Let me break down each solution:

1. HCl is a strong acid. The formula is HCl, so each mole gives one mole of H+ ions. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is moles per liter, so moles of HCl = 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 moles. So that's 0.1 moles of H+.

2. H2SO4 is sulfuric acid, a strong acid as well. But since it's diprotic, each mole releases two H+ ions. Okay, so for H2SO4, volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in solution, it completely dissociates into 2 H+ and SO4^2- ions. So yes, 0.09 moles of H2SO4 gives 0.18 moles H+.

3. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. The formula is Ba(OH)2, so each mole gives two OH- ions. The volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives two OH-, so total OH- is 0.2 moles.

Now, the neutralization reaction between acids and bases. The H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base.

Total H+ available: HCl contributes 0.1 moles, H2SO4 contributes 0.18 moles. So total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- available: Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 moles.

So when these react, the H+ and OH- will combine to form water. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

The limiting reactant here would be which one runs out first. So let's see: we have 0.28 moles H+ and 0.2 moles OH-.

If all OH- is consumed, it would require 0.2 moles H+. So after reaction, the remaining H+ would be 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles.

So OH- is the limiting reactant. Because it's less than H+.

Wait, but wait, wait. Neutralization usually requires equal moles of H+ and OH- to produce water. So any excess H+ or OH- will determine if there's excess acid or base.

In this case, since OH- is 0.2 and H+ is 0.28, OH- is the limiting reagent. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, neutralizing 0.2 moles of H+.

So the moles of H+ that remain unreacted are 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles. So the solution will be acidic because there's excess H+.

But wait, wait a second. When the problem talks about enthalpy of neutralization, that typically refers to the heat released when an acid and base are neutralized to form water. So in this case, the maximum amount of neutralization possible is 0.2 moles of H+ reacting with 0.2 moles of OH-.

But wait, no. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; when it's in solution, it dissociates completely into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH-.

So the calculations I did earlier are correct.

So the total moles of H+ from both acids is 0.28, and OH- is 0.2.

So 0.2 moles of H+ will react with 0.2 moles of OH- to form 0.2 moles of H2O.

Wait, but H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. Wait, does that affect anything? Well, in this case, each mole of H2SO4 gives two H+, so that's already accounted for in the 0.18 moles of H+.

So the neutralization is H+ + OH- → H2O. So each mole of H+ reacting with OH- releases a certain amount of heat.

The standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually given as about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-), because the reaction is exothermic. Wait, but sometimes it's per mole of acid or base. Hmm, I need to be careful here.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization (ΔH) is the enthalpy change when one mole of acid reacts with one mole of base to form water. For strong acids and strong bases, it's approximately -57 kJ/mol. But sometimes it's given per mole of H+.

Wait, no. Let me think. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually per mole of reaction. For example, HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O. The ΔH is about -57 kJ per mole of reaction, which produces one mole of water. But in this case, H+ from HCl and OH- from NaOH combine to form H2O. So each mole of H+ that reacts contributes to the enthalpy change.

So here, the reaction we have is the combined H+ and OH- from the three solutions. But the limiting factor is the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So total moles of H+ reacting is 0.2 (since OH- is 0.2). So the enthalpy change would be 0.2 moles * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options given are in kcal and kJ. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) -2.72 kcal
B) -11.42 kcal
C) -3.80 kcal
D) -16.0 kJ

Hmm, so if I have -11.4 kJ, that's close to option D, which is -16.0 kJ. Wait, but wait. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check my calculations. Wait, 0.2 moles of H+ reacting would be 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. So that would be approximately -11.4 kJ. But that's not an option. The closest option is D: -16.0 kJ. Hmm. Wait, did I make a mistake in moles?

Wait, let me recalculate the moles again.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 moles → each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles OH-.

So total H+ is 0.28, OH- 0.2.

So moles of H+ reacting is 0.2.

So 0.2 mol * 57 kJ/mol (but the sign is negative because it's exothermic, so -11.4 kJ).

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is a bit higher. So maybe I made a miscalculation in the moles.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the stoichiometry beyond just H+ and OH-.

Wait, no. The neutralization is always 1:1.

Wait, perhaps the concentration was not calculated correctly. Let me check the volumes again.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L, 0.2 M → 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L, 0.3 M → 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles, which gives 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L, 0.5 M → 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2 → each gives two OH-, so 0.2 moles OH-.

So that's correct.

Wait, but wait. Maybe the mistake is in the assumption that all H+ is from HCl and H2SO4. But wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in solution, it's fully dissociated. So in the first dissociation step, H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-.

Wait, but wait, actually, the first dissociation is complete, but the second (HSO4- → H+ + SO4^2-) is also pretty much complete for strong sulfuric acid. So yes, 0.09 moles of H2SO4 gives 0.18 moles H+.

So I think that's correct.

So the neutralization is 0.2 moles, leading to -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options again, option B is -11.42 kcal. Oh wait, wait! The options mix kcal and kJ. So perhaps the calculation is in kcal, not kJ.

Wait, because 1 cal is about 4.184 J, so 1 kJ is about 239 cal. So 57 kJ is about 13,506 cal, which is 13.5 kcal.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the units. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about 57 kJ/mol, which is about 13.5 kcal/mol.

So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ → 11.4 kJ is 11.4 / 4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal? Wait no, wait.

Wait, no. Wait, 1 kJ is 239.006 cal. So 57 kJ is 57 * 239.006 ≈ 13,504 cal → 13.504 kcal.

So per mole, it's about -13.5 kcal.

Wait, but wait, wait. I'm getting confused. Let me think:

57 kJ per mole is the same as 57,000 J per mole. Since 1 cal = 4.184 J, then 57,000 J is 57,000 / 4.184 ≈ 13,593 cal → 13.593 kcal.

So 57 kJ ≈ 13.59 kcal. So per mole of H+.

So if we have 0.2 moles reacting, the enthalpy would be 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ, which is -11,400 J → converting to kcal: 11,400 / 4184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but that's option A. But earlier I thought the neutralization is 0.2 moles, so 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ, which is 11.4 * (1 cal/4.184 J) → no, wait, 1 kJ is 239 cal, so 11.4 kJ is 11.4 * 239 cal ≈ 2723.6 cal → 2.7236 kcal. So approximately -2.72 kcal.

But wait, option A is -2.72 kcal. But wait, the problem is about the enthalpy when these three solutions are mixed. So is that correct?

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the enthalpy of neutralization is expressed per mole of acid or per mole of base, but in this case, it's per mole of H+.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that Ba(OH)2 is a dihydroxide, so each mole gives two moles of OH-.

Wait, but that was already accounted for in the calculation.

Hmm. So the total neutralization is 0.2 moles of H+ reacting with 0.2 moles OH-, so the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options have D as -16.0 kJ. So that's a big difference. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider all the H+ available and not just the neutralized part. Let me think.

Wait, no, because the neutralization only occurs for the amount that can react with the OH-. Excess H+ remains, but it doesn't contribute to neutralization; it just makes the solution acidic.

Wait, but perhaps the question is asking for the maximum possible neutralization, but that can't be because the OH- is the limiting reagent.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that the enthalpy is only from H+ and OH- combining. Because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, when it reacts with a base, the second H+ may not release as much enthalpy because it's a weaker acid in the second dissociation. Wait, but H2SO4 is a strong acid, so both dissociations are complete.

Wait, no, wait. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid in the first dissociation: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait. No, actually, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- is not correct. Wait, correction: H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-.

Wait no, no, no! Wait, actually, the first dissociation of H2SO4 is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- in aq solution? No, I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The first dissociation of H2SO4 is H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^- (which is complete). The second dissociation is HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-, which is also almost complete for concentrated solutions. So in solution, H2SO4 fully dissociates into 2 H+ and SO4^2-.

So in our calculation, 0.09 moles of H2SO4 gives 0.18 moles of H+.

So that part is correct.

So, back to the problem: the neutralization is 0.2 moles of H+ reacting, giving a ΔH of -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have that. Wait, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So, if the calculation is -11.4 kJ, none of the options match exactly. Wait, but option D is -16 kJ, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait, H+ from HCl is 0.1, from H2SO4 is 0.18. Total H+ is 0.28.

OH- is 0.2.

So the neutralization is min(0.28, 0.2) = 0.2 moles.

So ΔH is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But none of the options have that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for enthalpy of neutralization, maybe -57 kcal/mol instead of kJ.

Wait, but 57 kcal is a lot. 57 kcal is 57,000 cal, which is 238.6 kJ (since 1 kcal ≈ 4.184 kJ).

Wait, perhaps the question is using the enthalpy as -57 kcal per mole? That would change the calculation.

Wait, 57 kcal per mole is way too high because 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ, so 57 kcal is 238 kJ. So if the standard ΔH is -57 kcal/mol, then 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kcal.

Looking back at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. So that would make sense.

But why would the standard ΔH be in kcal? Because usually, it's given in kJ. So perhaps the problem is using an old unit convention.

Wait, but usually, the enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole. So if the problem presents the options in kcal, then the correct calculation would be to convert.

Wait, but wait, 57 kJ is approximately 13.5 kcal (since 57 / 4.184 ≈ 13.58).

So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * 13.58 ≈ 2.716 → approximately -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, that's confusing.

Let me summarize:

If the enthalpy per mole of H+ is -57 kJ → 57,000 J/mol.

To convert to kcal: 57,000 J / 4184 J/kcal ≈ 13.59 kcal.

So per mole → 13.59 kcal.

So for 0.2 moles → 0.2 * 13.59 ≈ 2.72 kcal, so ΔH is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Alternatively, if the problem uses -57 kcal per mole, then 0.2 moles would be -11.4 kcal (option B), but that's an unusually high value.

So which is it?

Well, the options include both kcal and kJ. So, perhaps the problem expects us to use the enthalpy in kcal, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles.

Wait, let me check the volumes again.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. 0.3 *0.3=0.09 moles → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles → 0.2 moles OH-.

So the neutralization is 0.2 moles.

So if the enthalpy is -57 kJ per mole, then total is -11.4 kJ, which is not one of the options except perhaps D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to consider both the first and second dissociation steps separately.

Wait, another thought: The H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so perhaps the second H+ doesn't release as much heat. But in reality, H2SO4 is a strong acid, so both H+ are considered fully dissociated, so no difference in the enthalpy.

Wait, but maybe the problem considers that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid and when it neutralizes, the first H+ contributes the full -57 kJ, and the second H+ only contributes half or something. Wait, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is mixing up the units, and the correct answer is option B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately -11.4 kJ converted to kcal.

Wait, no. Wait, 11.4 kJ is 11400 J. 11400 /4184 = approx 2.72 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which matches 11.4 kJ.

But then why is option B -11.42 kcal? That would be approximately -49.2 kJ.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the moles of acid and base in a different way.

Wait, another approach: perhaps calculate the total equivalents of acid and base.

HCl is a monoprotic acid, so equivalents = 0.1 moles.

H2SO4 is diprotic, so equivalents = 0.09 moles * 2 = 0.18.

Ba(OH)2 is a diprotic base (each mole gives two OH-), so equivalents = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2.

So the total acid equivalents (H+) is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

The total base equivalents (OH-) is 0.2.

So the neutralization is 0.2 equivalents. So that's 0.2 moles of H+ reacting.

So, if the enthalpy is -57 kJ per mole, 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is -11,400 J.

In kcal, that's 11,400 J / 4184 J/kcal ≈ 2.72 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal.

But why is option B present as -11.42 kcal? That would imply 49.2 kJ, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization, perhaps -57.2 kcal per mole.

Wait, 57.2 kcal is 239,000 J, which is about 239 kJ, which is way too high. So that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The key calculation is 0.2 moles of H+ reacting, leading to ΔH = 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, the only one close is D: -16.0 kJ, which is higher. So that might not be the case.

But wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Maybe it's using -40 kJ per mole.

Wait, 0.2 * (-40) = -8 kJ, which doesn't match any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the reaction produces 2 moles of H2O per mole of H2SO4. Wait, but that's not correct; each mole of H+ contributes to one mole of H2O.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each mole of H2SO4 contributes two moles of H+, so the enthalpy is 2 * (-57) per mole of H2SO4, but that's not correct. Because the enthalpy is per mole of H+.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of moles. Let me check again.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 moles → correct.

H2SO4: 0.3 *0.3 = 0.09 moles → correct. So 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 *0.5 = 0.1 moles, which → 0.2 moles OH-.

Total H+ → 0.28.

So neutralization is 0.2 H+ → 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

So which option is that?

The options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So only option D is in kJ, and it's -16.0 kJ, which is a bit off. But wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value, like -80 kJ per mole.

0.2 * (-80) = -16 kJ, which would match option D.

But why would the problem use -80 kJ per mole? That's not standard. The standard value is about -57 kJ per mole.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me think about the actual neutralization reaction considering all three solutions.

Wait, the overall reaction would be the sum of the H+ from HCl and H2SO4 reacting with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

But wait, HCl is monoprotic, and Ba(OH)2 is diprotic. Wait, perhaps the neutralization would be:

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl + H2O?

No, that's not correct. The reaction would be more accurately written as:

2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

Wait, because Ba(OH)2 has two OH- ions, so it would need two H+ ions from HCl. So for each mole of Ba(OH)2, 2 moles of HCl would be needed.

Similarly, H2SO4 provides two H+ per mole, so it can neutralize two moles of OH- per mole.

Hmm, perhaps I should approach this by considering the reaction as:

Total H+ = 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28.

Total OH- = 0.2.

So the neutralization is 0.2 H+ + 0.2 OH- → 0.2 H2O.

The enthalpy is 0.2 × (ΔH per mole of H+).

Assuming ΔH is -57 kJ/mol, so 0.2 × (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

So the correct answer would be approximately -11.4 kJ.

But none of the options match that. The closest is option D: -16.0 kJ.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for ΔH, perhaps -80 kJ per mole.

So 0.2 × (-80) = -16 kJ → which matches option D.

But why would the problem use -80 kJ? That's not the standard value.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think.

Wait, maybe the total moles of H+ reacting is more than 0.2.

Wait, no. The OH- is only 0.2 moles, so it can only react with 0.2 moles of H+.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the total moles of H+ and OH- and then calculates the excess.

Wait, the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2.

The neutralization is 0.2, so the remaining H+ is 0.08.

So the solution is acidic, but that doesn't affect the enthalpy of neutralization, which is only for the amount that reacts.

Given that, the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ, which is not one of the options except perhaps if I made a unit mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal, so 11.4 kJ is 11,400 J, which is 11,400 / 4184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal.

But why would the problem mix kJ and kcal in the options?

The options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So, the correct calculation is 0.2 moles × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ, which is option D if it were -11.4 kJ, but option D is -16.0 kJ.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the reaction in terms of equivalents. So, considering the number of equivalents of acid and base.

HCl: 0.1 equivalents (since 1 H+ per mole)

H2SO4: 0.18 equivalents (since 2 H+ per mole)

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 equivalents (since 2 OH- per mole)

So, the acid equivalents are 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

The base equivalents are 0.2.

So, neutralization is 0.2 equivalents, leading to ΔH = 0.2 × (-57,000 cal) [if using cal] → wait, but 57 kJ is 57,000 J.

Wait, wait, if the enthalpy is -57 kJ per mole, that's -57,000 J.

Converting to kcal: 57,000 J / 4184 J/kcal ≈ 13.59 kcal.

So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 × 13.59 ≈ 2.72 kcal → -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

So perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal, and the correct calculation leads to option A.

But why is option B present? Oh, because 0.2 × (-57 kJ) is -11.4 kJ, which is 11,400 J → 11,400 /4184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So option A is correct.

But the problem's options have option B as -11.42 kcal, which would be if the moles were 0.222..., but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the neutralization is not just 0.2 moles, but another factor.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the molarity of the solutions and the dilution effect on the enthalpy. But I don't think so; the enthalpy per mole is a constant.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be -2.72 kcal, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing the given solutions, we first determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions available:

1. **HCl (500 mL, 0.2 M):**  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{mol/L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Since HCl is monoprotic, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

2. **H₂SO₄ (300 mL, 0.3 M):**  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{mol/L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   As H₂SO₄ is diprotic, it contributes \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

3. **Ba(OH)₂ (200 mL, 0.5 M):**  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{mol/L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Since Ba(OH)₂ is diprotic, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

### Neutralization Reaction
The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \to \text{H}_2\text{O} \).  
- Total \( \text{H}^+ \) available = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).  
- Total \( \text{OH}^- \) available = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  

The limiting reactant is \( \text{OH}^- \), as it is present in the smaller amount. Thus, \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \) reacts with \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{OH}^- \).

### Enthalpy of Neutralization
The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) (or \( -13.5 \, \text{kcal/mol} \)) for strong acids and bases.  
- For \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \), the enthalpy change is:  
  \[
  \Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
  \]

### Unit Conversion
If the result is expressed in kcal:  
\[
-11.4 \, \text{kJ} \times \frac{1 \, \text{kcal}}{4.184 \, \text{kJ}} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Matches the calculated value when converted to kcal.  
- **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** Incorrect, as it corresponds to \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \) misinterpreted as kcal.  
- **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** Incorrect, as it does not match any valid calculation.  
- **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** Incorrect, as it overestimates the enthalpy change.

### Final Answer
The correct enthalpy of neutralization is \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \), corresponding to **Option A**.
