Okay, I have this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism. The options are four compounds, numbered 1 to 4, and the choices are combinations of these.

First, I need to remember what optical isomerism is. Optical isomerism, also known as enantiomerism, occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning they are not superimposable on their mirror image. Chiral centers are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. If a compound has at least one chiral center, it can have enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images. These enantiomers are optically active, meaning they can rotate plane-polarized light.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**

Hmm, let's visualize this structure. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring, which are the meta positions relative to the connecting bond. Also, there are nitro groups at 6 and 6' positions on each ring. Wait, I think it's 6,6' so both nitro groups are on the same side? Or no, each has their own nitro group.

Wait, but more importantly, what about the substituents on the biphenyl? The compound is a dimethyl ester of a dicarboxylic acid, so each of the two carboxylate groups is esterified with a methyl group. So, each ring has a methyl ester group (OCH3) at position 2 and a nitro group (NO2) at position 6.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the two rings are connected in a way that allows for some kind of symmetry. But if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center, then it would show optical isomerism.

Wait, biphenyl compounds can have axial chirality if the connecting single bond is between two rings with different substituents. Axial chirality is when the two rings are connected in such a way that the substituents around the bond lead to non-superimposable mirror images. So in biphenyl systems, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it can be chiral.

In this case, each ring has a methyl ester (OCH3) and a nitro group (NO2) at specific positions. Let me think: the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the two rings are asymmetric. For example, if the two rings are connected with substituents like OCH3 and NO2 on each, arranged in a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image. So if the two rings are connected in a way that their substituents are in a non-symmetric arrangement, the molecule could have axial chirality.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound has a plane of symmetry. Wait, the substituents are at 2 and 2' positions. If the two rings are connected at 1 and 1', then substituents are at 2 and 2'. Let me imagine the biphenyl: each ring has a nitro group at the 6 position. Wait, wait, the positions are 6 and 6' for nitro? Or is it 6 on one ring and 6' on the other. Wait, the way the name is written, it's 6,6'-dinitro, so each ring has a nitro group at position 6. So each ring has a nitro at 6, and each has a carboxylate ester at 2.

Wait, a biphenyl with each ring having substituents at positions 2 and 6. If the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the overall structure is not symmetrical, then it might have a chiral axis. 

Wait, maybe I should think about the possibility of meso compounds. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound and won't show optical isomerism. So if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then no optical isomerism. But if the arrangement is asymmetric, then it will.

Alternatively, perhaps each ring has substituents that make the entire molecule chiral. Let's think: the methyl ester groups are at 2 and 2' positions, and nitro groups at 6 and 6'. Wait, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a methyl ester at 2. Let me imagine each benzene ring as such: position 1 is the point where the rings connect. So positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to that. On each ring, positions 2 (meta to 1) and 6 (ortho to 1) are substituted.

Wait, perhaps the two rings have substituents in such a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that when you mirror the molecule, it doesn't look the same. So that would make it chiral, hence showing optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps because the substituents are at the 2 and 6 positions on each ring, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry. Let me think: if both rings have substituents in the same positions relative to the connecting bond, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. But wait, in this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a methyl ester at 2. So each ring is the same in terms of substituent positions. So if the arrangement is such that each ring's substituents are mirror images, the overall molecule might be symmetrical, making it not chiral.

Wait, but if the arrangement across the biphenyl axis is such that the substituents are mirror images, then the molecule might be meso, hence no optical isomerism. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is chiral.

I'm a bit confused, but maybe I should look for the presence of a chiral center.

Wait, in this compound, are there any chiral centers? The ester groups are OCH3. The carbons where the ester groups are attached: each is a carbonyl group (COOCH3). So the carbon attached to the oxygen in the ester is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's not a chiral center.

Wait, but perhaps the biphenyl's connecting bond can be a chiral axis. So, axial chirality. Axial chirality occurs when the two substituents on either side of the single bond are different and not mirror images. So if each ring has substituents arranged in a way that their positions relative to the bond create a chiral axis, then the molecule would be chiral.

In this case, each ring has a methyl ester (OCH3) and a nitro group (NO2) in certain positions. Let me imagine: the two rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. Each ring has a methyl ester at position 2 and a nitro at position 6. So on each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which are opposite each other (since in a benzene ring, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to position 1, which is the connecting point).

Wait, no. In a benzene ring, position 1 is connected to another benzene ring. The positions adjacent (ortho) are 2 and 6 on each ring. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are ortho to the connecting point. So each ring has two substituents: a methyl ester and a nitro group at the ortho positions.

Wait, but if both substituents on each ring are at the same positions, then perhaps the molecule has a symmetry plane. If the two rings are mirror images of each other, the molecule would be symmetrical. So maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound and thus not showing optical isomerism.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents in the two rings are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, leading to axial chirality. For example, if the substituents on one ring are arranged differently than on the other, but I think in this case, each ring has the same substituents.

Wait, maybe if the substituents are on the same side of each ring, leading to a situation where the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image. Let me think: imagine each ring has the methyl ester at position 2 and the nitro at position 6. If the two rings are arranged such that the methyl ester groups are on the same side relative to the connecting bond, then the molecule might be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry. For instance, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that rotating the molecule 180 degrees about the central bond would swap the substituents. In that case, the molecule would be achiral.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Maybe this compound does exhibit optical isomerism because the substituents are arranged asymmetrically around the central bond, leading to axial chirality. I'll tentatively mark this as possibly showing optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**

The molecule is an ester. Let's break it down. The acid part is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxy would mean the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be methyl ester: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Let me draw the structure: the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to OH, another CH2 group, and the COOCH3 group. So the structure would be:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3?

Wait, no, because propanoate would have three carbons. The correct structure is:

The acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: the three carbons are CH2(OH), CH2, and COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but the carbon chain is of three carbons. So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)
Carbon 2: CH2 (connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3)
Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, no. Let me think again. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

So the molecule methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that would be four carbons? No, the ester is methyl, so the acid is on the third carbon.

Wait, maybe it's better to write the structure. The ester is formed from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. So the acid is:

O

|
O=C-OCH3

on carbon 3. Carbon 2 has -OH, and carbon 1 is a CH3 group? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try again.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, meaning the structure is CH3-CH2-COOH. So the 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, which is the CH2 group. So it becomes CH3-CH(OH)-COOH.

Wait, but that's 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Then its methyl ester would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Now, looking for chiral centers. The central carbon (the CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3 (carbon 1)
- OH (hydroxy)
- COOCH3 (ester group)
- and another CH2 group? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- CH3 (carbon 1)
- OH
- COOCH3 (carbon 3)
- and what else? Wait, no. Carbon 2 is attached to three groups: CH3, OH, and COOCH3. Wait, but a carbon can only have four bonds. So carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (CH3)
- OH
- COOCH3
- And another H?

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again. The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So methyl ester is CH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, but 2-hydroxy means the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the propanoate.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 is the ester group.

The propanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, but wait, that's four carbons, but propanoate is three. Hmm, perhaps I need to reconsider.

Alternatively, perhaps it's: 

The structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, that's four carbons. No, that's butanoate if there are four. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. Then its ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Now, looking at the central carbon in the CH(OH) group. What are its substituents?

- CH3 (from carbon 1)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from carbon 3)
- And a hydrogen?

Wait, no. Carbon 2 would be attached to:

- CH3 (carbon 1)
- COOCH3 (carbon 3)
- OH
- and another bond. Wait, carbon 2 is connected to carbon 1 and 3, and has two substituents (OH and maybe another). Wait, no. Let me draw the structure:

Carbon chain: Carbon 1 (CH3) - Carbon 2 (CH(OH)) - Carbon 3 (COOCH3).

So Carbon 2 has four bonds: 

1. To Carbon 1 (CH3 group)
2. To Carbon 3 (COOCH3)
3. OH group
4. A hydrogen atom.

So the substituents on Carbon 2 are:

- CH3 (from Carbon 1)
- COOCH3 (from Carbon 3)
- OH
- H.

Wait, no. Carbon 2 is CH(OH), so connected to Carbon 1 (CH3), Carbon 3 (COOCH3), OH, and a hydrogen. So four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H.

Wait, wait. If a carbon is attached to four different groups, it's a chiral center. So in this case, Carbon 2 is attached to CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. Are these four different groups?

Yes. CH3 is a methyl group, COOCH3 is a ester group, OH is hydroxyl, and H is hydrogen. So all four substituents are different. That means Carbon 2 is a chiral center. Therefore, this molecule has a chiral center and thus can exhibit optical isomerism.

So compound 2 does show optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**

Benzophenone is an aromatic compound with two benzene rings connected by a ketone group. Its structure is Ph-CO-Ph, where Ph is a benzene ring.

Now, does benzophenone have any chiral centers or axial chirality? Benzophenone's structure is symmetrical, with the ketone group in the center connecting the two benzene rings. Each benzene ring is attached to the carbonyl group. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the carbonyl group, making the two halves mirror images. Because of this symmetry, benzophenone is not chiral. It doesn't have any chiral centers or axial chirality. So it doesn't show optical isomerism.

So compound 3 does not show optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl fumarate**

Fumarate is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid. Dimethyl fumarate is the di-ester, where each carboxylic acid group is esterified with a methyl group. The structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, fumarate is the cis isomer of maleic acid. Wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is the cis-dihydroxy form, and fumarate is the trans form. Wait, no, actually, fumarate is the trans isomer. Let me get this straight.

Wait, maleic acid is HOOC-CHCH-COOH (the cis form with the two COOH groups on adjacent carbons and the double bond between the two middle carbons. Fumarate is the trans isomer, so the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but as an ester in dimethyl fumarate: CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no. Wait, the correct structure of fumarate is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H? No, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=C(COOCH3)2, with the substituents on opposite sides of the double bond. Wait, no, the double bond is between the two carbons bearing the ester groups.

Wait, let's think again. The structure of fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when esterified with methyl, it becomes CH2=C(COOCH3)2. But wait, that's the same as the structure of trans-dimethyl fumarate, which actually is the same as the structure of dimethyl fumarate. Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, no, fumarate is the trans diastereomer. So the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, but in any case, dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with two ester groups on either end. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2, but wait, that's not correct. Wait, no: the structure is (COOCH3)2C=CH2? No, wait. Let me think: the correct structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Hmm, no, perhaps I need to think more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (COOCH3)2C=CH2, but that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's more accurate to say that dimethyl fumarate has two ester groups attached to the same carbon as the double bond.

Wait, regardless, the key point is whether the molecule has any chiral centers or whether it's a geometric isomer that allows for optical activity.

Wait, the molecule has a double bond. If the substituents on either side of the double bond are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center, then it could have optical isomerism.

Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So each of the two carbons in the double bond (C and C) have two ester groups (COOCH3) and two hydrogen atoms. So each of these carbons has two ester groups and two H's.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. The structure is (COOCH3)CH2CH2(COOCH3) but with a double bond. Or more accurately, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. No, that doesn't make sense because each carbon in the double bond would have two ester groups, which isn't possible.

Wait, perhaps it's more correct to write it as (CH2(COOCH3))2C=CH2? No, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (COOCH3)2C=CH2. But that would mean each of the carbons in the double bond has two ester groups attached. That's not possible because each carbon in a double bond can only have two substituents.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So each carbon in the double bond has two ester groups. But that would make each carbon attached to two ester groups and two hydrogens. So each carbon would have two identical groups (ester) and two H's. So each of those carbons would have the same groups: two COOCH3 and two H. So they're not chiral centers.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is not symmetric. Wait, perhaps in dimethyl fumarate, each of the double bond carbons has two different groups. Then one of them could be a chiral center.

Wait, let me think. The structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. No, wait, that's possible. So one carbon has two COOCH3 groups, and the other has two CH2 groups. No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the structure. Let me think about the possibility of geometric isomerism. Fumarate is the trans isomer, meaning that the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. But wait, if the substituents are the same on each side, then the molecule could have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, the molecule is (COOCH3)2C=CH2? No, wait, the actual structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups and two hydrogen atoms. So each carbon is attached to two identical groups (COOCH3) and two H's. So each carbon isn't a chiral center because they have identical substituents.

Wait, but if the two substituents on each carbon are the same, then no, they can't be chiral centers. Hence, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. So why would dimethyl fumarate show optical isomerism?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, but the molecule as a whole is symmetrical. So the molecule is not chiral. 

Wait, but dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate, which is the cis isomer. So if fumarate is trans, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, leading to axial chirality.

Wait, no, because in fumarate, the substituents are on opposite sides, but if they're the same groups, then the molecule is symmetrical. Let me imagine: if each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. So it would be achiral.

Wait, but wait, that's not correct. Let me consider the molecule:

The structure is (COOCH3)CH2-CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond. No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So each end of the double bond has a CH2 and a CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3). No, that doesn't make sense either.

I think I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me try a different approach. Does dimethyl fumarate exhibit optical isomerism?

I recall that maleic acid is a diacid, and its esters can have optical activity. For example, dimethyl maleate is a chiral molecule because the two ester groups are on the same side of the double bond, leading to a chiral center. Wait, no, because each carbon in the double bond would have two ester groups and two H's, so no chiral centers.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again. In dimethyl maleate, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups, so each has two identical substituents (COOCH3) and two H's. So each carbon can't be a chiral center because they have identical groups. Hence, the molecule can't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but that's not right. I think I'm confusing maleate and fumarate. Wait, maleic acid is the cis diacid, and fumaric acid is the trans diacid. Their esters would reflect that.

Wait, when you esterify maleic acid, you get dimethyl maleate, which has the two ester groups on the same side of the double bond. This would result in a molecule that's chiral because the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are not the same. Wait, but each carbon has two identical substituents.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think about each carbon in the double bond. Suppose the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So each carbon in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two H's. So for each carbon, the substituents are COOCH3, COOCH3, H, H. So they can't be chiral centers because two substituents are identical.

Wait, but if the groups are arranged in a way that creates a chiral axis or something else, then maybe. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has no plane of symmetry, leading to axial chirality.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possibility of the molecule being meso. Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, making it achiral.

No, because fumarate is the trans isomer, and if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound and hence not chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a chiral molecule because the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are in a configuration that leads to a lack of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me recall that maleate esters can be chiral. For example, dimethyl maleate is known to be a chiral molecule because the two ester groups are on the same side, leading to a chiral center.

Wait, but in that case, each carbon in the double bond would have two ester groups and two H's. So each carbon would have two identical substituents, making them not chiral centers.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe I should think about whether the molecule has a center of symmetry or a plane of symmetry.

In dimethyl fumarate, if the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are identical, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So for example, if each carbon has two COOCH3 groups, then the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. But if the substituents are different, then it's chiral.

Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, each carbon has two COOCH3 groups. So each carbon cannot be a chiral center because they have two identical substituents. So the molecule wouldn't have any chiral centers. Hence, it wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I might be wrong because I remember that fumarate is a trans diacid and its ester can have some sort of chirality. Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about the possibility of internal planes of symmetry.

In dimethyl fumarate, the structure would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond (since it's the trans isomer). If the substituents on each side are the same, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For instance, if each substituent is a COOCH3 group, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the double bond, making it achiral.

So in that case, dimethyl fumarate would not show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: sometimes, even if each substituent is the same, if the arrangement leads to no symmetry, the molecule can be chiral. For example, in the case of a double bond with identical substituents on each carbon but arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, leading to axial chirality.

Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. So the molecule would look like this: COOCH3 is on both ends of the double bond, but on opposite sides.

Wait, but if the substituents are the same on each carbon, the molecule is symmetrical. So it's not chiral.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to recall. I think that dimethyl fumarate does not have any chiral centers and is achiral. Therefore, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought that dimethyl maleate is chiral. Let me think again. Maleate is the cis isomer, so the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side. That would mean that the molecule has a chiral center, making it optically active. But fumarate is the trans isomer, which would be achiral.

Wait, that makes sense. So dimethyl fumarate is the trans diastereomer and is achiral because the substituents are arranged symmetrically. So it doesn't show optical isomerism. In contrast, dimethyl maleate is the cis isomer and is chiral.

Wait, but the question is about dimethyl fumarate. So according to this, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Another approach: perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So in this case, dimethyl fumarate wouldn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. If the substituents on each side of the double bond are identical, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So if both sides are identical, the molecule is achiral. Hence, no optical isomerism.

So, to recap:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: Maybe has axial chirality, so shows optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Has a chiral center, so shows optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone: Symmetrical, no optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: Symmetrical, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought that based on the substituents, dimethyl fumarate might be achiral. So, which of the options include compounds 1 and 2?

Looking back at the options:

Option A) 1, 2, and 4

Option B) 3 and 4

Option C) 2 and 3

Option D) 1 and 2.

But according to my analysis, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism. Wait, but I'm not sure about compound 1.

Wait, earlier I was confused about compound 1. Let me think again. If the biphenyl system has substituents arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then it would show optical isomerism. But if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then it's achiral.

The compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a methyl ester at 2.

Wait, in biphenyl systems, if the substituents are in positions that are across from each other, the molecule can have axial chirality. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that their positions relative to the central bond create a chiral axis.

In this case, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a methyl ester at 2. Let me imagine the biphenyl as two benzene rings connected at positions 1 and 1'. Each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. Now, if the substituents are arranged in a way that their positions relative to the connecting bond create a chiral axis, then the molecule would be chiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule is achiral.

Wait, but how can I determine that? Let me think about the positions. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a methyl ester at 2. So from the connecting bond (1-1'), the substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which are ortho and para positions relative to the connecting point.

But in a biphenyl, the positions 2 and 6 are on opposite ends of the ring. So perhaps the substituents are arranged such that on each ring, the nitro is in one position, and the methyl ester is in another, leading to an asymmetric arrangement.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should consider whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Suppose the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule can be mirrored, then it's achiral. If not, then it's chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is similar to dinitrophenyl compounds, which can be chiral. For example, if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral.

I think that this compound (1) would have axial chirality because the substituents on the two rings are arranged asymmetrically around the central bond. So it would show optical isomerism.

So, putting it all together:

Compound 1: shows optical isomerism

Compound 2: shows optical isomerism

Compound 3: doesn't

Compound 4: doesn't

So the correct answer would be the option that includes compounds 1 and 2. Looking at the options:

Option D) 1 and 2.

Wait, but earlier I thought that compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate) doesn't show optical isomerism. So the correct answer would be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (asymmetric arrangement around a single bond, such as in biphenyl systems).

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Each ring has a nitro group (NO₂) at position 6 and a methyl ester (COOCH₃) at position 2. The arrangement of these substituents around the central bond creates axial chirality because the substituents on the two rings are not symmetrical. This lack of symmetry results in non-superimposable mirror images, making the compound optically active.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure Ph-CO-Ph, where Ph represents a benzene ring. The molecule is symmetrical, with a plane of symmetry passing through the carbonyl group. Due to this symmetry, benzophenone does not have any chiral centers or axial chirality and is therefore not optically active.

4. **Dimethyl fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate has the structure CH₂=C(COOCH₃)₂. It is the trans isomer of the diacid fumaric acid. Each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two identical groups (COOCH₃), and the molecule has a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the compound achiral, and it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism due to axial chirality and a chiral center, respectively. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral due to symmetry. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
