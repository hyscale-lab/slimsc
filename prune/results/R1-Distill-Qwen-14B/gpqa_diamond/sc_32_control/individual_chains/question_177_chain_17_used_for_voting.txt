Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the answer step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is:

- Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2.
- The mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. So M1 = 1.5 * M2.
- The wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. That probably relates to their temperatures since the peak wavelength λ_max is given by Wien's Law, λ_max ∝ 1/T.
- The radial velocities are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. I'm not sure how this affects luminosity directly, but maybe it's a red herring or relates to Doppler shift.

The problem states that the stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies. So I should use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Wait, but what about the Doppler shift? Suppose the velocities affect the observed wavelengths. Oh, right! If a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength (as seen from Earth) shifts due to the Doppler effect. But wait, the question says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So maybe they have the same observed wavelength, but that could be due to their actual temperatures or Doppler shifts.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak emission wavelength is the same because of the Doppler effect. Hmm, but the problem says they found the same wavelengths. I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think.

So, the peak wavelength λ_max is determined by T using Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.9e-3 m·K). If the observed λ_max for both stars is the same, that could be due to their actual temperatures being the same, or because their velocities cause a shift that makes their observed λ_max same.

Wait, but the question says the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So that's the λ_max observed. So if Star_2 is moving towards or away from us, its observed λ_max would be different. But the problem says they are the same, so maybe the Doppler shifts cancel out the temperature differences.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocities are such that the Doppler shift brings their λ_max to the same observed value. Let me model that.

The Doppler effect for wavelength is given by:

λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Wait, no, the formula I remember is:

λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But wait, I'm a bit hazy. Let me think. The Doppler shift formula for receding (positive velocity away) is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But for small velocities compared to c (which is the case here, 700 km/s is about 0.23% the speed of light, since c is ~3e5 km/s), the approximation λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r/c) holds. But for more precise calculations, maybe the relativistic formula is better.

But wait, the question states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So for each star, the emitted peak wavelength (due to temperature) and the Doppler shift combine to give the same observed λ_max.

So, let's denote:

For Star_1: λ_obs1 = λ1 * sqrt( (1 + v1/c)/(1 - v1/c) )

Wait, but Star_1's radial velocity is 0, so v1 = 0. So λ_obs1 = λ1.

For Star_2: λ_obs2 = λ2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But since the observed wavelengths are the same, λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 → λ1 = λ2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But wait, λ1 is the emitted wavelength of Star_1, which is determined by its temperature T1 via Wien's law: λ1 = b / T1.

Similarly, λ2 = b / T2. So substituting:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + (v2/c)) / (1 - (v2/c)) )

The b's cancel out, so:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Let me rearrange that:

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c) )

But v2 is the radial velocity of Star_2, which is 700 km/s. Let me compute v2/c.

v2 = 700 km/s = 7e5 m/s. c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

v2/c ≈ 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.002333...

So, (1 - v2/c) ≈ 0.997666...

(1 + v2/c) ≈ 1.002333...

So (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ≈ (0.997666)/(1.002333) ≈ approximately 0.9953.

So sqrt(0.9953) ≈ approximately 0.99765.

So T1 ≈ T2 * 0.99765 → T1 ≈ 0.99765 * T2.

Hmm, so T1 is slightly less than T2. Not a huge difference, but perhaps significant.

Wait, but if Star_1's velocity is zero, then its observed wavelength is just its emitted wavelength. For Star_2, which is moving at 700 km/s, let's assume that it's moving away, so v2 is positive, leading to a redshift. So its emitted wavelength would be shorter (bluer) than the observed wavelength. Wait, no: if the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshift), so λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c). But in our case, since the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars, and Star_2 is moving away, its emitted wavelength must be shorter than Star_1's.

Wait, let's think again. If Star_2 is moving away (v2 positive), then λ_obs2 = λ2 * (1 + v2/c). So if λ_obs2 must equal λ_obs1 = λ1, then λ1 = λ2 (1 + v2/c). So λ1 = λ2 * (1 + 0.002333) → λ1 ≈ 1.002333 * λ2.

Since λ is inversely proportional to T, that implies T1 = T2 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.99766 * T2, which matches the earlier calculation.

So, T1 ≈ 0.99766 * T2.

But wait, the exact value would be better calculated. Let's compute sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) more accurately.

v = 700 km/s = 7e5 m/s.

Compute (1 - v/c) = (1 - 7e5/(3e8)) = 1 - (7/(300)) = 1 - 0.023333... = 0.976666...

Wait, wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me compute v/c accurately.

v/c = 700,000 m/s / 300,000,000 m/s = 700/3e5 = 7/(300) = 0.0023333...

So (1 - v/c) = 1 - 0.0023333 = 0.997666667...

(1 + v/c) = 1 + 0.0023333 = 1.002333333...

So (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) = (0.997666667) / (1.002333333) = approximately ?

Let me compute 0.997666667 / 1.002333333.

Hmm, 0.997666667 ÷ 1.002333333.

Let me compute this division.

Approximately, 0.997666667 ≈ 0.997666667.

1.002333333 ≈ 1.002333333.

So 0.997666667 / 1.002333333 ≈ ?

Let me compute 0.997666667 ÷ 1.002333333.

Another way: 0.997666667 ≈ 1 - 0.002333333.

Denominator is 1 + 0.002333333.

So using the approximation (1 - x)/(1 + x) ≈ 1 - 2x for small x.

Here, x=0.002333333.

So (1 - x)/(1 + x) ≈ 1 - 2x = 1 - 0.004666666 ≈ 0.995333334.

So the square root of this is sqrt(0.995333334) ≈ ?

Since sqrt(1 - 2x) ≈ 1 - x when x is small.

Because (1 - a)^2 ≈ 1 - 2a for small a.

So let's let 1 - a = 0.995333334 → a ≈ 0.004666666.

So sqrt(1 - a) ≈ 1 - a/2 → 1 - 0.004666666 / 2 ≈ 1 - 0.002333333 ≈ 0.997666667.

Which brings us back to the same value.

Wait, I think I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try a different approach. Let me compute the exact value.

Compute (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) = (0.9976666667)/(1.0023333333) = ?

Let me compute this using a calculator approach.

0.9976666667 ÷ 1.0023333333.

Let me compute 0.9976666667 / 1.0023333333.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1e6 to eliminate decimals:

= 997666.6667 / 1002333.3333.

Hmm, that's approximately 0.995334.

Wait, so sqrt(0.995334) would be around 0.997665, because (0.997665)^2 = approx 0.995334.

Yes, because (0.997665)^2 = (1 - 0.002335)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.002335) = 0.99533.

So, T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ≈ T2 * 0.997665.

So T1 ≈ 0.997665 * T2.

But wait, I'm not sure if this is accurate enough. Let's compute it more precisely.

Another approach: Let me compute the value (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) = [1 - 0.002333333]/[1 + 0.002333333] = (0.997666667)/(1.002333333).

Let me compute this division.

0.997666667 ÷ 1.002333333.

Let me approximate this as 0.997666667 / 1.002333333 ≈ 0.99533.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of fractions. 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s, and c is 3e8 m/s.

So v/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) = 7/300 ≈ 0.023333333.

Wait, wait a minute! Oh, I think I made a mistake earlier. v = 700 km/s, so 700,000 m/s. Divided by 3e8 m/s gives 700e3 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333333.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Oh, I see! I think I messed up the decimal points.

Wait, 700,000 m/s is 7e5 m/s. 3e8 m/s is 300,000,000 m/s.

So 7e5 / 3e8 = (7/3) * 1e5 / 1e8 = (7/3) * 1e-3 = approx 2.3333e-3.

So v/c = 0.002333333...

Ah, that's the correct value. So my earlier calculations were correct, and the denominator and numerator are 0.997666667 and 1.002333333 respectively.

So, the ratio is (0.997666667)/(1.002333333) ≈ 0.995333333.

The square root of that is approximately 0.997666667.

So T1 = T2 * 0.997666667.

So, T1 ≈ 0.997666667 T2.

Now, the luminosity of a star is given by L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So, for Star_1, L1 = 4π (R1)^2 σ (T1)^4.

Star_2: L2 = 4π (R2)^2 σ (T2)^4.

We need to find the ratio L1/L2.

Given R1 = 1.5 R2, T1 = 0.997666667 T2.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4) )= ( (1.5 R2 / R2 )^2 ) * ( (0.997666667 T2 / T2 )^4 )

Simplify:

= (1.5)^2 * (0.997666667)^4.

Compute each part:

1.5 squared is 2.25.

0.997666667^4: Let's compute this.

First, compute 0.997666667 squared:

0.997666667^2 ≈ (1 - 0.002333333)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.002333333 + (0.002333333)^2 ≈ 0.995333334.

Wait, more accurately: 0.997666667 * 0.997666667.

Let me compute 0.997666667 * 0.997666667.

= (1 - 0.002333333) * (1 - 0.002333333)
= 1 - 2*(0.002333333) + (0.002333333)^2
= 1 - 0.004666666 + (0.000005444)
≈ 1 - 0.004666666 = 0.995333334.

Then, square that result again to get 0.997666667^4.

So, 0.995333334 squared:

= (0.995333334)^2.

Again, using the same approach:

= (1 - 0.004666666)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.004666666) + (0.004666666)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.009333332 + 0.000021777 ≈ 0.990688445.

So, (0.997666667)^4 ≈ 0.990688445.

So, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.990688445.

Compute 2.25 * 0.990688445.

2.25 * 0.99 ≈ 2.2275.

But let's compute it accurately:

0.990688445 * 2.25.

2.25 * 0.990688445 = ?

Break it down:

2 * 0.990688445 = 1.98137689.

0.25 * 0.990688445 = 0.24767211.

Add them: 1.98137689 + 0.24767211 = 2.229049.

So approximately 2.229.

Looking at the options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Hmm, 2.229 is closest to option D, which is ~2.23.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of T1. Let me check my steps again.

Wait, perhaps using a more accurate approach for the temperature ratio.

Wait, another thing: The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ), but that's the relativistic Doppler shift. Alternatively, for small velocities, λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v/c).

Wait, but in this problem, the velocities are 700 km/s, which is about 0.23% of the speed of light. So using the approximation might be okay.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact formula for the Doppler shift. Let me reconsider.

The observed wavelength λ_obs is given by λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), where v is the radial velocity away from us. Since Star_2 has a velocity of 700 km/s away, v is positive.

So, for Star_1, since its radial velocity is zero, λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

For Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

The problem states that λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But λ_rest is related to the star's temperature via Wien's law: λ_rest = b / T.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

T1 = T2 / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which can be rewritten as:

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Which is what I had earlier.

Now, computing sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

v/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333333.

So,

(1 - 0.023333333)/(1 + 0.023333333) = 0.976666667 / 1.023333333 ≈ ?

Wait, wait a second. Oh no, I think I made a mistake earlier in which I missed a decimal point. Because 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s, and c is 3e8 m/s. So v/c = (7e5)/(3e8) = 7/(3e3) ≈ 0.002333333.

Wait, wait, wait. Now I'm really confused. Let me compute this correctly.

v = 700,000 m/s.

c = 300,000,000 m/s.

v/c = 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 7 / 300 = 0.02333333333...

Wait, no: 700,000 = 7e5, and 300,000,000 = 3e8.

So 7e5 / 3e8 = (7/3) * 1e5 / 1e8 = (7/3)*1e-3 = 0.002333333333...

So v/c is approximately 0.002333333333, which is 0.233333...%.

So, (1 - v/c) = 1 - 0.002333333333 ≈ 0.9976666667.

(1 + v/c) = 1.0023333333.

So the ratio (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) = (0.9976666667)/(1.0023333333) ≈ 0.995333333.

So sqrt(0.995333333) ≈ 0.997665.

So T1 = T2 * 0.997665.

Thus, T1 ≈ 0.997665 T2.

Now, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4).

R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R1^2 = (1.5)^2 R2^2 = 2.25 R2^2.

T1^4 = (0.997665)^4 T2^4.

Compute (0.997665)^4:

0.997665^2 ≈ (1 - 0.002335)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.002335 + (0.002335)^2 ≈ 0.99533 + 0.00000545 ≈ 0.99533545.

Then, square that again: (0.99533545)^2 ≈ (approx 0.995335)^2.

Compute 0.995335 * 0.995335:

≈ (1 - 0.004665)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.004665) + (0.004665)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00933 + 0.0000217 ≈ 0.9906717.

So, (0.997665)^4 ≈ 0.9906717.

Now L1/L2 = (2.25) * (0.9906717) ≈ 2.25 * 0.9906717.

Compute that:

2.25 * 0.9906717 ≈ ?

Let me compute:

0.9906717 * 2.25.

2 * 0.9906717 = 1.9813434.

0.25 * 0.9906717 = 0.247667925.

Adding together: 1.9813434 + 0.247667925 ≈ 2.2290113.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.229, which is approximately 2.23.

Looking back at the options:

Option D is ~2.23.

So the answer should be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \( R \) is the radius, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The ratio of luminosities is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Given Data:
- \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)
- Radial velocity of Star_2: \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)
- Observed peak wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) are the same for both stars.

### Step 1: Relating Temperatures Using Wien's Law and Doppler Shift
The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by the Doppler shift formula:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]

For Star_1 (\( v_1 = 0 \)), \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} \).  
For Star_2 (\( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)), \( \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}} \).

Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \), we equate the two:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]

Using Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{rest}} \propto 1/T \)), we find:

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{T_2} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
T_1 = T_2 \sqrt{\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( T_1 / T_2 \)
The radial velocity of Star_2 is \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), and the speed of light is \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{v}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]

Substitute into the temperature ratio:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - 0.002333}{1 + 0.002333}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.997667}{1.002333}}
\]

Compute the ratio:

\[
\frac{0.997667}{1.002333} \approx 0.995333
\]

Take the square root:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{0.995333} \approx 0.997665
\]

Thus, \( T_1 \approx 0.997665 T_2 \).

### Step 3: Compute \( L_1 / L_2 \)
Substitute \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_1 \approx 0.997665 T_2 \) into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5 R_2)^2 (0.997665 T_2)^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \cdot (0.997665)^4
\]

Compute each term:
- \( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \)
- \( (0.997665)^4 \approx 0.990672 \)

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \cdot 0.990672 \approx 2.229
\]

### Step 4: Match to Closest Option
The calculated ratio \( L_1 / L_2 \approx 2.229 \) is closest to option **D (~2.23)**.

ANSWER: D
