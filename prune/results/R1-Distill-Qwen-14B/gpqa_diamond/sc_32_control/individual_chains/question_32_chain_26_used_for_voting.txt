Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when a nucleus X is moving at 0.96c. The nucleus X is given as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I think I need to break this down step by step.

First, I should figure out what nucleus X is. Li usually refers to lithium. The standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons and 4 neutrons, making it Li-7. But in this case, it's Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, so if it has 3 neutrons, then the number of protons would still be 3? Because lithium has atomic number 3, so 3 protons. So 3 protons and 3 neutrons would make Li-6. Oh wait, no, wait. Because Li normally has 3 protons and varying neutrons. So Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons, right? So that's the nucleus we're dealing with here.

Now, the question is about the energy of the RHIC. RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so I think they're referring to the kinetic energy of the ion. But wait, in relativistic terms, energy is usually the total energy, which includes rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. Wait, no, sometimes the kinetic energy is what's given, but I need to clarify that.

The problem states the speed is 0.96c, and I need to find the energy. So probably, it's the total energy because in particle physics, when they give energy for colliders, it's often the total energy (rest mass plus kinetic). But I'm a bit unsure. Let me think.

The formula for total energy in relativity is E = gamma * m0 c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I can calculate gamma first.

Let me calculate gamma when v = 0.96c. So v is 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c². So in the denominator, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - (0.96)^2. Let me compute that. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me compute more accurately. 0.96^2 is 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

Now, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so total mass is 6 nucleons. Wait, the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², same for a neutron, around 939 MeV/c². Wait, more precisely, I think the proton is about 938.272 MeV and neutron is about 939.565 MeV, but maybe for this problem, using approximate values is okay.

But wait, when you have a nucleus, you have to account for the binding energy, right? Because the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons due to the mass defect (Einstein's equation). But wait, in this context, when calculating the total energy of the nucleus, do I need to use the exact rest mass or the sum of the individual nucleons?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Because, the rest mass of the nucleus is the sum of the rest masses of the nucleons minus the binding energy. But when considering the total energy, you use the actual rest mass. So I think I should find the rest mass of Li-6, which is known.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that each nucleon contributes its rest mass and not worry about the binding energy. But that seems unlikely because the binding energy is significant for heavy nuclei. Wait, but the problem might be simplified, maybe considering each nucleon as a free particle. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is just using the mass of a single nucleon, but that doesn't make sense because it's a nucleus of multiple nucleons. Wait, perhaps the problem is treating the nucleus as a single particle with mass equal to the sum of the masses of the individual nucleons. But that's probably not correct because it would ignore the binding energy.

Wait, but perhaps for the sake of this problem, they're assuming that the rest mass is the sum of the individual protons and neutrons. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the atomic mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the proton and neutron masses. Let me check. For Li-6, each proton is about 938 MeV/c², each neutron about 939 MeV/c². So for 3 protons and 3 neutrons, sum is (3 * 938) + (3 * 939) = 3*(938+939) = 3*(1877) = 5631 MeV. But wait, the actual mass of Li-6 is less than that because of the binding energy.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is approximating the mass as the sum of the individual nucleons. So for Li-6, that would be 6 nucleons each about 938 MeV. Oh wait, but the neutron is a bit heavier. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look up the exact mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass as m = 6 * m_p (assuming m_p is the proton mass, which is slightly less than the neutron's mass, but maybe the difference is negligible here).

Wait, but the problem gives the options in GeV, so perhaps I should proceed in terms of GeV.

Wait, the mass of a proton is about 0.938 GeV/c², and a neutron is about 0.9395 GeV/c². So Li-6 would have a mass of 3*(0.938) +3*(0.9395) = 3*(1.8775) = 5.6325 GeV/c². But wait, that's the sum of individual masses, but the actual mass of Li-6 is less due to binding energy.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is treating the nucleus as a single particle with mass m, and I should take the rest mass energy as m c², where m is the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. So I need to find the exact mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use m = 6 * m_nucleon, where m_nucleon is about 0.938 GeV/c². But perhaps that's an approximation.

Wait, let me think again. The problem is about the energy of the nucleus in the collider, which is at a speed of 0.96c. So the total energy E is gamma * m * c². So I need the mass of the nucleus.

I think the correct approach is to find the actual rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let me recall that the mass of Li-6 is approximately 6 * 1.0087 atomic mass units (AMU), but actually, it's a bit less because of the binding energy.

Wait, but to be precise, perhaps the exact value is needed. Let me think about how to calculate the rest mass of Li-6.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is given as approximately 6.013 atomic mass units. Hmm, but wait, each AMU is about 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.013 AMU * 931.5 MeV/AMU = 6.013 * 931.5 MeV. Let me compute that. 6 * 931.5 is 5589 MeV, 0.013 *931.5 is about 12.11, so total is approximately 5601.11 MeV, which is 5.601 GeV.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I should use the exact mass based on binding energy. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a single nucleon, but that would be incorrect for a nucleus. Hmm.

Let me try to think if I remember the exact mass. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the given data without worrying about the exact mass. Or perhaps the problem is using the mass as the sum of the individual nucleon masses, which is 6 nucleons each of 0.938 GeV, so 6 * 0.938 = 5.628 GeV. But that's just the sum, not considering binding.

Wait, but if I proceed with the sum, E = gamma * m c². Gamma is 3.5714, m is 5.628 GeV/c². So E = 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV ≈ 3.5714 * 5.628.

Let me compute that: 3 *5.628 =16.884, 0.5714 *5.628 ≈ let's see, 0.5 *5.628=2.814, 0.0714*5.628≈0.403, so total 2.814+0.403=3.217. So 16.884 +3.217≈20.101 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.1 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But wait, maybe the actual mass is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is higher. Because, Li-6's actual mass is 6.013213 u. Let me compute that. 6.013213 *931.5 MeV/u = let's compute this.

6 *931.5 = 5589 MeV. 0.013213 *931.5 ≈ 0.013213 *900=11.8917, 0.013213 *31.5≈0.417, total ≈12.308. So 5589+12.308=5601.308 MeV, which is 5.601308 GeV.

So using m=5.601308 GeV/c². Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 * 5.601308 GeV.

Let me calculate that. 3 *5.601308 =16.803924; 0.57142857 *5.601308.

0.5 *5.601308 =2.800654.

0.07142857 *5.601308 ≈ let's compute 5.601308 * 0.07 =0.39209156, and 5.601308 *0.00142857≈0.008 (approximately). So total ≈0.39209156 + 0.008 = 0.40009156.

So 2.800654 +0.40009156 ≈3.20074556.

Adding that to 16.803924 +3.20074556 = 20.00467 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.00467 GeV, which is approximately 20.005 GeV. Hmm, but the options don't have that exactly. Let's see the options again.

Options:
A) 18.475 GeV
B) 23.069 GeV
C) 20.132 GeV
D) 21.419 GeV

Wait, none of them are exactly 20.005, but option C is 20.132. Hmm, perhaps my approximation of the mass is a bit off. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, perhaps the exact mass is 6.013213 u. So 6.013213 *931.5 MeV/u.

Let me compute that more accurately.

6.013213 *931.5 = ?

I can compute 6 *931.5 = 5589.

0.013213 *931.5: Let's compute 0.01 *931.5 =9.315.

0.003213 *931.5: 0.003 *931.5=2.7945, 0.000213 *931.5≈0.1988, so total 2.7945 +0.1988=2.9933.

So 0.013213 *931.5 =9.315 +2.9933=12.3083.

So total is 5589 +12.3083=5601.3083 MeV =5.6013083 GeV.

So m=5.6013083 GeV/c².

So E=gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.6013083.

Let's calculate 3.57142857 *5.6013083.

Let me compute this more precisely.

3 *5.6013083 =16.803925.

0.57142857 *5.6013083.

Compute 0.5 *5.6013083=2.80065415.

0.07142857 *5.6013083.

Let me compute 5.6013083 *0.07=0.392091561.

5.6013083 *0.00142857 ≈ 0.008 (since 1/700 is about 0.00142857, and 5.6013083 * (1/700) = approx 0.008).

So 0.392091561 + 0.008 = 0.400091561.

So 0.57142857 *5.6013083 ≈2.80065415 +0.400091561=3.20074571.

So total E =16.803925 +3.20074571=20.0046707 GeV.

Hmm, so about 20.0047 GeV. But looking at the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV. But wait, that's 0.127 GeV higher. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again. Did I calculate gamma correctly?

Yes, v=0.96c. So gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

So that part is correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem treats the nucleus as a single proton or other mistake. Or perhaps the nucleus is considered as a single nucleon, which doesn't make sense because it's a nucleus of 6 nucleons.

Wait, no, wait. The nucleus is Li-6, which has 6 nucleons (3 protons, 3 neutrons). So each nucleus has 6 nucleons. So the mass would be about 6 times the mass of a nucleon, but considering binding energy, which makes it a bit less.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a single nucleon. That would be wrong, but let me see.

If I use m = 1 nucleon's mass, say 0.938 GeV/c², then E =3.5714 * 0.938= approx 3.346 GeV, which is nowhere near the options.

Hmm, but that's way too low, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass of the lithium atom, which includes electrons as well. But that seems unlikely because in heavy ion colliders, they usually refer to the nucleus, not the atom.

Wait, maybe the mistake is in the mass I'm using. Let me double-check the mass of Li-6.

Upon checking, the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.013213 atomic mass units (u). 1 u is approximately 931.494 MeV/c².

So 6.013213 u * 931.494 MeV/u = let me compute that.

6 *931.494=5588.964 MeV.

0.013213 *931.494: 

0.01 *931.494 =9.31494.

0.003213 *931.494 ≈ let's compute 0.003 *931.494=2.794482; 0.000213 *931.494≈0.1987.

So 2.794482 +0.1987≈2.99318.

So total is 9.31494 +2.99318=12.30812 MeV.

So total E for the rest mass is 5588.964 +12.30812=5601.272 MeV, which is 5.601272 GeV.

So m=5.601272 GeV/c².

So E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.601272 GeV.

Let me compute this more accurately.

3.57142857 *5.601272.

Compute 3 *5.601272 =16.803816.

0.57142857 *5.601272 = ?

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute 5.601272 * (57142857/1e8). Alternatively, I can write 0.57142857 as 4/7 (since 1/7 ≈0.142857, so 4/7≈0.57142857).

So 5.601272 *4/7 = (5.601272 *4)/7 = (22.405088)/7 ≈3.200726857.

So total E =16.803816 +3.200726857 =20.00454286 GeV, which is approximately 20.0045 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest would be option C)20.132 GeV, but that's about 0.127 GeV higher than my calculation. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in gamma or mass.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma. Let me check that again.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)=1/sqrt(1 -0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rest energy.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem uses the rest mass energy as the sum of each nucleon's rest energy, without considering binding. So for Li-6, 3 protons and 3 neutrons, each with mass about 0.938 GeV.

So m =3*(0.938) +3*(0.9395) =3*(1.8775)=5.6325 GeV/c².

Then E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.6325 GeV.

Compute that: 3.57142857 *5.6325.

3 *5.6325=16.8975.

0.57142857 *5.6325.

0.5 *5.6325=2.81625.

0.07142857 *5.6325≈0.404999 (since 5.6325 *0.07=0.394275, and 5.6325*0.00142857≈0.008043, so total ≈0.394275 +0.008043=0.402318).

So 2.81625 +0.402318=3.218568.

Total E=16.8975 +3.218568=20.116068 GeV.

That's approximately 20.116 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

So perhaps the problem expects us to use the sum of the individual nucleon masses, not considering binding energy. Because when I did that, I got approximately 20.116 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV).

But why the discrepancy? Because in reality, the rest mass of Li-6 is about 5.601 GeV, but using the sum gives 5.6325 GeV. So the difference is about 0.0315 GeV. So when multiplied by gamma (3.5714), that 0.0315 GeV becomes about 0.112 GeV. So that's why when using the sum, I get about 20.116, which is about 0.116 GeV higher than when using the exact mass.

But the options don't have 20.0045 GeV, so perhaps the problem expects me to use the sum of the individual nucleon masses, leading to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.601272 again.

Wait, 5.601272 *3.57142857.

I can compute this as 5.601272 * 357142857 /1e8.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator approach:

5.601272 *3.57142857.

Let me multiply 5.601272 by 3.57142857.

Breaking it down:

5.601272 *3 =16.803816.

5.601272 *0.5 =2.800636.

5.601272 *0.07142857 ≈5.601272 * (1/14) ≈0.400090857.

So adding 16.803816 +2.800636=19.604452, plus 0.400090857=20.00454286 GeV.

So that's about 20.0045 GeV, which doesn't match any option exactly. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the molar mass and not adjusting for Avogadro's number. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the mass of a single proton. No, that would be way too low.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me check gamma again.

v =0.96c; v²/c²=0.9216.

1 - v²/c²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857. Correct.

Hmm, another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

Wait, if the question asks for kinetic energy, then K = (gamma -1) m c².

So in that case, if m=5.601272 GeV, gamma=3.57142857.

So K = (3.57142857 -1) *5.601272 ≈2.57142857 *5.601272 = let's compute that.

2 *5.601272=11.202544.

0.57142857 *5.601272=3.2007457.

So total K=11.202544 +3.2007457=14.4032897 GeV.

But that's option A:18.475 GeV, no. Hmm, that's not matching any option except perhaps none.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the rest mass as that of a single proton, but that would be way off.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the mass of the entire nucleus as the sum of the individual nucleon masses, not considering binding. So if m=6 *0.938 GeV=5.628 GeV.

Then E=gamma *m=3.5714 *5.628= approx 20.13 GeV.

Because 3.5714 *5.628: 5 *3.5714=17.857, 0.628 *3.5714≈2.245. So total ≈20.102 GeV. But in any case, using more precise calculation, it comes to about 20.116 GeV, which is close to option C:20.132 GeV.

So perhaps the intended approach is to use the sum of nucleon masses, leading to option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) for a Li-6 nucleus moving at 0.96c, we calculate the total energy using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (\(\gamma\))
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

For \(v = 0.96c\):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus
The Li-6 nucleus consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using approximate values for the proton and neutron masses (\(m_p \approx 0.938 \, \text{GeV}/c^2\) and \(m_n \approx 0.9395 \, \text{GeV}/c^2\)), the total rest mass energy is:

\[
m = 3m_p + 3m_n = 3(0.938) + 3(0.9395) = 3(1.8775) = 5.6325 \, \text{GeV}/c^2
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
Using the formula \(E = \gamma m c^2\), the total energy is:

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.6325 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking the calculation into parts:

\[
3.5714 \times 5.6325 = 3 \times 5.6325 + 0.5714 \times 5.6325
\]

1. \(3 \times 5.6325 = 16.8975\)
2. \(0.5714 \times 5.6325 \approx 3.2186\)

Adding these together:

\[
E \approx 16.8975 + 3.2186 = 20.1161 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy (\(20.1161 \, \text{GeV}\)) is closest to option **C) 20.132 GeV**. The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding differences in the problem setup.

### Final Answer:
The energy of the RHIC for the Li-6 nucleus moving at 0.96c is approximately **20.132 GeV**.

**Answer: C**
