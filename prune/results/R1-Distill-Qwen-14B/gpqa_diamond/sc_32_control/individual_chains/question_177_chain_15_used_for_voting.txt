Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's read the problem again.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given data is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same, which I think relates to their temperatures. The radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. We're supposed to find out by how much the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. Okay, I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So if both stars are black bodies, their luminosities will depend on R squared and temperature to the fourth power.

Wait, but how do I find the temperatures of each star? The problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max ≈ constant / T. Oh wait, the exact formula is λ_max (in meters) = (2.898 × 10⁻³ m·K) / T(K). So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same, right? Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So if λ_max is the same, T is the same.

Wait, but wait. Oh, unless the Doppler effect is affecting the observed wavelengths. Because Star_2 is moving away (radial velocity is 700 km/s), which would cause a redshift. So the observed wavelength would be longer than the actual emitted wavelength.

So the observed λ_max for Star_2 would be λ_emitted * (1 + v/c), since it's moving away. For Star_1, the velocity is zero, so observed λ_max is the same as emitted. But wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max for both is the same, but their actual emitted λ_max might be different because of the Doppler shift.

So here's the plan:

1. Use the Doppler effect to find the actual temperature of each star.
2. Then compute their luminosities using L = (R² T⁴) since the constants (4πσ) will cancel out when taking the ratio.

Wait, let's structure this:

Let’s denote:
- R1 = 1.5 R2
- M1 = 1.5 M2 (but wait, mass might not be directly needed here, unless we're considering other factors. But the problem gives it; perhaps it's a red herring, or maybe it's needed for something else, but in the blackbody luminosity formula, mass doesn't come into play. So maybe that's extra info.)

But let's stick to the given data.

Both stars have the same observed λ_max. Let’s denote:

λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.

But due to Doppler shift, λ_obs for Star_2 is λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v2/c), where v2 is 700 km/s.

Similarly, Star_1's λ_obs is λ_emitted,1 (since v1=0).

But from Wien's law, λ_emitted is proportional to 1/T. So:

λ_emitted,1 = b / T1,
λ_emitted,2 = b / T2,

where b is Wien's displacement constant.

But the observed λ_max for Star_2 is λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v2/c) = λ_obs,2.

Similarly, for Star_1, λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1.

But the problem states that λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2. So:

λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v2/c).

Substituting from Wien's law:

b/(T1) = (b/(T2)) * (1 + v2/c).

We can cancel b from both sides:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c).

Let me rearrange this:

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c).

But v2 is 700 km/s. Let's compute 700,000 m/s divided by the speed of light, which is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So v2/c = 700e3 / (3e8) ≈ 0.002333...

So 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.002333.

So T1 = T2 / 1.002333 ≈ T2 * 0.99767.

Wait, but that's a small change. So T1 is slightly less than T2? Or wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Because if the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). But the observed λ_max is the same for both. So, Star_2's emitted wavelength is shorter than observed, because it's moving away. So if λ_obs,2 = λ_obs,1 = λ_emit,1, then:

λ_emit,2 * (1 + v2/c) = λ_emit,1.

But λ_emit is inversely proportional to T. So higher T gives shorter λ_emit.

So if λ_emit,2 is smaller than λ_emit,1, then T2 must be larger than T1. Wait, let's think again.

Suppose Star_2 is moving away. Its observed λ is longer than its emitted λ. Because when a star moves away, the wavelength stretches (redshift). So the observed λ for Star_2 is λ_emit,2 * (1 + v/c). 

But since both observed λs are the same, we have:

λ_emit,1 = λ_emit,2 * (1 + v/c).

Since λ_emit is proportional to 1/T, we can write:

λ_emit,1 / λ_emit,2 = (1 + v/c).

But λ_emit,1 = (1/T1) * b,
λ_emit,2 = (1/T2) * b.

So (1/T1)/(1/T2) )= (1 + v/c).

Which gives T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c).

So T2 = T1 * (1.002333).

So T2 is about 0.23% higher than T1.

Wait, that's a small difference, but perhaps significant for the luminosity calculation.

Now, with that in mind, let's compute the luminosity ratio.

Luminosity L = 4π R² σ T^4.

So the ratio L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4).

We know R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R1² = (2.25) R2².

So putting that into the ratio:

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (T1^4) / (T2^4).

But T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c) ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

So T2^4 = (T1 * 1.002333)^4.

Therefore, T1^4 / T2^4 = 1/(1.002333)^4.

Let me compute (1.002333)^4.

Calculating step by step:

1.002333^2 = (approx) 1.004666.

Then, 1.004666^2 ≈ 1.009379.

So 1.002333^4 ≈ 1.009379.

So 1/1.009379 ≈ 0.9907.

So the ratio becomes:

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907.

Calculating that, 2.25 * 0.9907.

Well, 2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275. But since it's 0.9907, which is a bit more than 0.99.

The exact value: 2.25 * 0.9907 = ?

Let me compute 2.25 * 0.9907:

0.9907 = 0.99 + 0.0007.

So 2.25 * 0.99 = 2.25 * (1 - 0.01) = 2.25 - 0.0225 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.0007 = 0.001575.

So adding together, 2.2275 + 0.001575 = 2.229075.

Approximately 2.229. So looking at the options, the closest is option D) ~2.23.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute (1.002333)^4 with more precision.

First, 1.002333 is approximately 1.0023333333.

Let me compute (1.002333)^2:

= 1.002333 * 1.002333.

Calculating:

1.002333 * 1.002333 ≈ (1 + 0.002333)^2 = 1 + 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2.

= 1 + 0.004666 + 0.00000544.

≈ 1.00467144.

Then, square that again: (1.00467144)^2.

= (1 + 0.00467144)^2.

= 1 + 2*0.00467144 + (0.00467144)^2.

= 1 + 0.00934288 + 0.00002182.

≈ 1.0093647.

So (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.0093647.

So 1 / (1.0093647) ≈ let's calculate that.

1 / 1.0093647 ≈ using approximation: 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x when x is small.

Here, x = 0.0093647. So 1 - 0.0093647 ≈ 0.990635.

But more accurately, let's compute 1 / 1.0093647.

Let me compute 1.0093647 * 0.9907 ≈ 1.0093647 * 0.9907.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator approach: the reciprocal of 1.0093647 is approximately 0.990635.

So yes, 1/1.0093647 ≈ 0.990635.

So back to the ratio:

L1/L2 = (R1²) * (T1^4) / (R2² T2^4) = (2.25) * (0.990635) ≈ 2.25 * 0.990635.

2.25 * 0.990635 = ?

Breaking it down:

2 * 0.990635 = 1.98127.

0.25 * 0.990635 = 0.24765875.

Adding together: 1.98127 + 0.24765875 = 2.22892875.

Approximately 2.2289, which is about 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check if I correctly accounted for the Doppler effect.

Because the observed λ_max is the same for both stars, so λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

But λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c).

λ_obs1 = λ_emit1.

So λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c).

And since λ_emit = b/T, we can write:

b/T1 = (b/(T2)) * (1 + v2/c).

So T1 = T2 / (1 +v2/c).

So T1 = T2 * (1 / (1.002333)) ≈ T2 * 0.997667.

So T1 is approximately 0.997667 * T2.

Which means T2 is higher than T1 by a factor of 1.002333.

Wait, but when calculating L1/L2, T is to the 4th power. So let's re-express the ratio.

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4,

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4) = (2.25) * (T1^4)/(T2^4).

But since T1 = T2 * (1/(1.002333)), so T1 = T2 * 0.997667.

So (T1/T2) = 0.997667.

So (T1^4)/(T2^4) = (0.997667)^4.

Calculating (0.997667)^4.

Hmm, let me compute 0.997667^2 first.

0.997667 * 0.997667 ≈ (1 - 0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2.

= 1 - 0.004666 + 0.00000544.

≈ 0.99533944.

Then, square that to get the fourth power: 0.99533944^2.

= (1 - 0.00466056)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00466056 + (0.00466056)^2.

= 1 - 0.00932112 + 0.0000217.

≈ 0.9907006.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So putting it all together:

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (0.9907) ≈ 2.2289, which is approximately 2.23.

So the correct answer should be option D) ~2.23.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the blackbody radiation formula for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(R\) is the radius, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The ratio of luminosities is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
From the problem, \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\). Therefore:

\[
\frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (\(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\)) are the same for both stars. Using Wien's Law (\(\lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T\)) and the Doppler effect, the relationship between the temperatures is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs},1} = \lambda_{\text{emit},1}, \quad \lambda_{\text{obs},2} = \lambda_{\text{emit},2} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

Since \(\lambda_{\text{obs},1} = \lambda_{\text{obs},2}\), we have:

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit},1} = \lambda_{\text{emit},2} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

Substituting \(\lambda_{\text{emit}} \propto 1/T\), we get:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}
\]

The radial velocity of Star_2 is \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\), and the speed of light is \(c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\). Thus:

\[
v_2/c = \frac{700 \times 10^3}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 0.002333
\]

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + 0.002333} \approx \frac{1}{1.002333} \approx 0.997667
\]

### Step 3: Temperature Ratio to the Fourth Power
The luminosity depends on \(T^4\), so:

\[
\frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4} = \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (0.997667)^4
\]

Calculating \((0.997667)^4\):

\[
(0.997667)^2 \approx 0.995339, \quad (0.995339)^2 \approx 0.9907
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4} \approx 0.9907
\]

### Step 4: Luminosity Ratio
Substituting into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} \cdot \frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.2289
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2.
