Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, the question describes a series of reactions. Let me list them out to get a clearer picture.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C, when reacted with water, reforms A and produces two acids, F (strong) and G (weak).
4. Gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

I need to figure out what E is, and then determine its molecular symmetry group from the options given.

Let me think about each reaction and the possible compounds involved.

Starting with reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red). Bright red product... Hmm. That makes me think of something like sulfur trioxide or maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe a transition metal compound. Wait, 8 equivalents—that's a lot. So maybe B is a diatomic gas, like O2 or Cl2. If A is solid, perhaps a metal oxide or something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is sulfur (solid S), and B is oxygen gas (O2). Then 8 equivalents of O2 would react with S to form SO3? Wait, but how many moles would that be? Let me think. Sulfur (S) has a molar mass of about 32 g/mol. Suppose A is S. Then, the reaction would be S + O2 → SO3? But wait, the typical reaction is S + O2 → SO2, but that's 1:1. Hmm, but maybe it's a different compound.

Wait, another angle: The product C is bright red. What compounds are bright red? Maybe something like Fe(OH)3 is reddish, but that's a precipitate. Alternatively, perhaps a chromium compound? Or maybe it's a transition metal with a high oxidation state. Oh wait, another idea: maybe C is lead dioxide (PbO2), which is dark brown, not red. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a transition metal sulfide or something else. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide. Let me think about other possibilities.

Moving on to reaction 3: C reacts with water to form A, plus two acids F and G, where F is strong and G is weak. So when C is hydrolyzed, it produces A and two acids. So if A is a metal, like Fe, then the hydrolysis might produce a metal hydroxide, but in this case, it's two acids. That suggests that C is an anhydride of two different acids. Oh! So C is probably a mixed anhydride or maybe a compound that can form two different acids when hydrolyzed.

Wait, for example, consider something like Na2CO3 reacting with water. No, that gives NaOH and CO2. Wait, but in this case, F and G are acids, so perhaps C is an acid anhydride. Another example: if C is a metal carbonate, but that would give a metal hydroxide and CO2, which is a gas, not an acid. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite or something else. Wait, maybe C is a dioxo compound, like sodium carbonate isn't, but maybe something else.

Wait, another angle: If C is a compound that when hydrolyzed gives two different oxyacids. For example, if C is something like a dichromate? Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a nitrate or sulfate. Wait, nitric acid is a strong acid, sulfuric is strong as well. But according to the problem, F is strong and G is weak. So when C is hydrolyzed, it produces F (strong) and G (weak). So perhaps C is a nitrate and another acid's anhydride.

Wait, wait. Let's think of something else. Maybe C is a sulfite? Sulfur trioxide (SO3) when reacted with water gives H2SO4. Oh, but that's a strong acid. Wait, but when I have a mixed anhydride, like say, something like (NH4)2SO3, which would hydrolyze into NH4HSO3 and H+? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound that upon hydrolysis gives two different acids. For example, if C is a mixed anhydride like H2SO3·HNO3. But that's getting complicated.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of what C could be. The initial reaction is between A and B, with 8 equivalents of B. Let's assume B is oxygen gas (O2). So A + 8 O2 → C. So for each mole of A, 8 moles of O2 are consumed. That would imply a high oxidation state for A.

If A is sulfur (S), then 8 O2 would give SO4^2-? Wait, but S in what form? Let me compute the stoichiometry. S (solid) + O2 → SO3? Or another possibility.

Wait, another approach: What about C being Fe3O4, which is a magnetic iron oxide. But I'm not sure about the color or reaction products.

Wait, maybe A is iron (Fe), and B is Cl2. Then, 8 equivalents of Cl2 with Fe would produce... FeCl3? But that's a possible reaction. But then, FeCl3 isn't bright red. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal, and B is Cl2. Let's think of a reaction where 8 Cl2 reacts with 1 A. Let's see. For example, if A is phosphorus, P + Cl2 → PCl5. That's 1 P + 5 Cl2 → PCl5. But that's 5 equivalents, not 8.

Wait, another idea: Maybe A is sodium (Na), and B is Cl2. Then, 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. But that's a 1:1 ratio, not 8. So perhaps that's not it.

Wait, maybe the product is something with a high oxygen content. Let's see, what about lead? PbO2 is dark brown, not red. So maybe another metal.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider other possibilities. What if C is a chromium compound? Chromium(VI) compounds are often colored. Like K2Cr2O7 is orange, but maybe another form.

Alternatively, maybe reaction 1 is the formation of a sulfate. If A is sulfur, then SO3 is formed with O2. Wait, but SO3 is a liquid, colorless. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about reaction 4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So D + B → H. H is a solvent—like water, ethanol, something like that. But wait, B is a gas. So D is also likely a gas. What gases combine in 1:1 to form a solvent?

Hmm, possible reactions: If B is O2 and D is H2, then H could be H2O? But O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O. But that's 2:1 ratio. Wait, but the question says 1:1 ratio. So perhaps D is something else.

Wait, another thought: What if D is Cl2 and B is H2. Then, H2 + Cl2 → 2 HCl (in the presence of light). But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe D is CO2 and B is H2O? Wait, but then CO2 and H2O would form carbonic acid, but that's a weak acid, not a solvent in the same way. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps D is NH3 and B is something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is H2O. But O2 and H2O in a 1:1 ratio would form something? Wait, O2 and H2O is just water. So that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. So, if D is Cl2, and C is something like FeCl3, then reacting with Cl2 might give some hazardous product.

Wait, but earlier I'm not sure about C yet. Let's think of possible C and E.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite or sulfate. Let's say C is Na2SO4. Then, reacting with D (maybe HCl) would form something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So perhaps C is an acid anhydride. For example, if C is something like (HO)2SO3 (which is sulfurous acid, but that's not stable), or maybe C is sodium sulfite, which when hydrolyzed gives H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH? But that would only form one acid. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: What if C is a carbonate? For example, Na2CO3. Hydrolysis would give NaOH and CO2. But CO2 is not an acid in that case—it's a gas. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride or something else. Wait, another idea: perhaps C is a sulfate. If C is Fe2(SO4)3, then hydrolysis would give Fe(OH)3 and H2SO4. But H2SO4 is a strong acid, and Fe(OH)3 is a base. Hmm, but the question says F and G are acids.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe C is a sulfite, and when it hydrolyzes, it produces H2SO3 (which is a weak acid) and another acid. Wait, but where's the other acid coming from?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound that has both sulfite and another anhydride group. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another angle: Let me think of what E could be. E is produced when C reacts with D, and it's extremely hazardous. So, E might be a toxic gas, or a highly reactive compound. For example, phosgene (but that's a gas), or perhaps something like hydrogen cyanide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe E is a carbonyl chloride or something similar. Wait, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate, and D is something else. Wait, let's think.

Wait, let's try to think of E. If E is extremely hazardous, it might be a compound like sarin gas or something else, but that's probably beyond the scope here. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly toxic gas like H2S, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is a highly reactive compound like ozone, but ozone is a gas and perhaps not formed in this reaction.

Wait, another thought: Maybe E is a heavy metal compound, like mercury(I) chloride, which is very toxic.

Alternatively, perhaps D is Cl2, and C is something like FeSO4. Then, reacting with Cl2 might produce FeCl3 and SO2. Wait, but E is a product, perhaps FeCl3 and SO2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a carbonate and D is HCl. Then, C (like Na2CO3) + HCl → NaCl, CO2, and H2O. But CO2 is a gas; but E is a product. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2SO4, but that's a liquid, not a gas.

Wait, perhaps D is SO3. Then, reaction with C could produce something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about reaction 4 again. D and B form H, a solvent. If H is a common solvent, like ethanol, water, or something else. Let's think about reactions that form solvents.

If B is O2 and D is H2, then H could be H2O. But that's a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1 as per reaction 4.

Wait, another possibility: B is CO2 and D is H2O. But that's not a reaction; they just mix.

Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is something else. For example, Cl2 + H2 → 2 HCl, but that's a 1:1 ratio of Cl2 to H2, producing HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Unless it's used as a solvent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe H is NH3. Then, D and B would have to react to form NH3. But what's B? If B is H2 and D is N2, that would require a high-energy reaction to form NH3, but the ratio would be 3 H2 : 1 N2 → 2 NH3. Not a 1:1 ratio.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working. Let me try to think of E and its symmetry group. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Wait, which of these are common for certain molecules. For example, D∞h is the symmetry group of a molecule with an infinite axis of symmetry, like a straight chain with a center of inversion. For example, something like a long hydrocarbon chain, but perhaps something else.

C2 is a two-fold rotation axis. D4h would have a four-fold rotation-reflection axis, which is more common in molecules with a square planar or similar symmetry, like some transition metal complexes.

C2v has a two-fold rotation and a vertical mirror plane. For example, molecules like H2O have C2v symmetry, but wait, H2O has D∞h? Or maybe not. Let me think: water has a structure with a central O atom and two H atoms, so its point group is C2v because it has a C2 axis (180-degree rotation) and a vertical mirror plane.

Wait, but E is the product we're interested in. So perhaps E is a molecule with C2v symmetry.

Wait, another possibility: If E is a molecule like SO2, which has a bent structure and Dihedral symmetry, but SO2 is D∞h? Or perhaps another molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like H2O, which is C2v. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but let's think: If the product E has a molecular symmetry group of C2v, which is one of the options (option D), then perhaps that's the correct answer.

But I need to tie this back to the reactions.

Wait, perhaps E is H2O, but that's unlikely because it's not extremely hazardous. Alternatively, E could be something like Cl2O or another compound.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like O3 (ozone), which has a bent structure and a certain symmetry.

Wait, but O3 has a C2v symmetry. Because ozone has a central O with two others attached in a bent structure, so yes, its point group is C2v.

Wait, but O3 is a triatomic molecule with a bent structure. Its symmetry is C2v because there's a C2 axis (180-degree rotation) and a mirror plane perpendicular to the axis.

So, if E is O3, then the symmetry group would be C2v. So option D is C2v.

But how does that tie into the reactions?

Let me try to reconstruct the reactions with E being O3.

Reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form O3. Then, what's C and D?

Wait, O3 is formed from O2 and something else. O3 is formed by the reaction O2 + energy → 2 O3, but that's a decomposition reaction. Alternatively, perhaps C is some compound that when reacted with D (like H2O) produces O3. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is another compound. Let me think of another possibility.

Wait, if E is a molecule like CO2, which has a linear structure and D∞h symmetry. But the options don't include D∞h as an option for E. Wait, looking at the options: option C is D∞h.

Wait, if E is CO2, then its symmetry group is D∞h. But then, how does that fit into the reactions?

CO2 is a linear molecule, so D∞h symmetry.

But, how would that be formed? Let me think.

In reaction 2, C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E (CO2).

If E is CO2, then let's see what C and D could be.

C is the product from reaction 1: A + 8 B → C.

Then, reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

If C is a carbonate, like CaCO3, then hydrolysis would produce CaCO3 + H2O → Ca(OH)2 + CO2. But that would give one strong acid (H2CO3 is weak, but maybe not). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, C could be a sulfite: Na2SO3. Then, hydrolysis would give 2 NaOH + H2SO3. Wait, but H2SO3 is a weak acid, so F is strong acid and G is weak. So perhaps C is a sulfite and a nitrate? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate and a nitrate mixed anhydride. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think of the possible products for each reaction.

Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red).

If B is O2, and A is S, then S + (8/4) O2 → 2 SO3. Wait, let me calculate the stoichiometry.

S + O2 → SO3.

The balanced equation is S + 3 O2 → 2 SO3, but that gives 3 equivalents of O2. But in the question, it's 8 equivalents. So if 8 O2 react with A, what's A?

Let me see: Suppose the reaction is 2 A + 8 B → 2 C. So per mole of A, 4 moles of B.

Wait, perhaps A is Fe, and B is O2. Then, Fe + O2 → FeO or Fe3O4. Wait, but Fe3O4 is a mixture of FeO and Fe2O3. But the color is black, not bright red. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: Maybe A is lead (Pb). Reaction with O2 could form PbO2, which is dark brown. But not red.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's consider what bright red products are common.

One bright red solid is mercury(II) oxide (HgO), but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps C is an iron(III) compound, like Fe(OH)3, but that's reddish-brown, not bright red.

Alternatively, maybe C is a chromium(VI) compound, like potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7), which is orange, not red.

Wait, perhaps it's a sulfide. For example, CdS is bright yellow, but not red. Alternatively, maybe a different sulfide.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a nitro compound, like a nitroso or nitro group. But I'm not sure about the color.

Alternatively, maybe C is a manganese compound. MnO2 is black, MnO is brown. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a vanadium compound. Vanadium(V) oxide is orange.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps C is something else.

Wait, let's think about reaction 3 again. C reacts with water to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So if C is an anhydride of two acids, one strong and one weak, perhaps C is a mixed anhydride.

Wait, for example, if C is (HNO3)(H2SO4), then upon hydrolysis, it would produce HNO3 (strong acid) and H2SO4 (strong acid), but that doesn't fit because G is weak.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate and another acid. Wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester, but that's a stretch.

Wait, another idea: Maybe C is sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), which upon hydrolysis gives NaOH and H2SO3. H2SO3 is a weak acid. But then, F is strong, so perhaps another acid is present. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate and a carbonate. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). If B is O2 and D is H2O, then that doesn't make sense. Another possibility: B is H2 and D is O2. Then, H would be H2O, which is a solvent. Reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So, in this case, B is O2, D is H2, and H is H2O.

So according to reaction 4, D and B are gases that react in a 1:1 ratio to form H. But the reaction I just thought of (H2 + O2 → H2O) is 2:1 for H2 to O2. So that's not 1:1.

Hmm, perhaps another reaction. Maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2. Then, Cl2 + H2 → 2 HCl (with light). HCl is a gas, not a solvent. So H can't be HCl.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is CH4. But their reaction would require high energy and not form a solvent.

Wait, perhaps B is N2 and D is H2. Then, under certain conditions, they form NH3. But the reaction is N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3. So that's a 3:1 ratio of H2 to N2, not 1:1.

Hmm, this is tricky.

Alternatively, maybe B is CO2 and D is H2O. But they don't react; they just mix.

Wait, another thought: maybe D is NH3 and B is HCl. They would react to form NH4Cl, which is a solid, but H is supposed to be a solvent. So that's not working.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2O and D is O2. But that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, maybe I should look for another approach.

Let me try to think about the possible structures of E and their symmetry groups.

If E has a symmetry group of D∞h, then it's a linear molecule with a center of inversion. Examples include CO2, HCN, etc.

If E has C2v symmetry, it would be a bent molecule with a C2 axis and mirror planes. Examples include H2O, O3.

If E has C2 symmetry, it would have a two-fold rotation axis. Examples include ethylene, etc.

If E has D4h symmetry, it would have a four-fold rotation axis with horizontal mirrors. Examples include square planar complexes.

Given that E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a gas like phosgene (COCl2), which is a toxic gas. But what's the symmetry of phosgene? Phosgene has a central carbon with two Cl and two O atoms. Its structure is similar to CO2 but with Cl substituents. Wait, no, phosgene is O=C(Cl)2, so it's a tetrahedral structure? Or is it planar?

Wait, no, phosgene has a structure where the central C is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. So the structure is trigonal planar. Wait, no, the actual structure of phosgene is a tetrahedral molecule because the C is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think. Carbon has four bonds. Double bond to O (which counts as two bonds) and two single bonds to Cl. So, four bonds in total. So, the structure is trigonal planar? Or tetrahedral?

Wait, no, the structure is trigonal planar because the double bond counts as two, so the geometry is trigonal planar with the central C attached to O (double bond) and two Cl (single bonds). So the shape is similar to SO2, which is bent and has a C2v symmetry.

So if E is phosgene (Cl2C=O), which has a bent structure, then its symmetry group would be C2v (option D). Hmm, that's possible.

But how does that fit into the reaction?

If E is Cl2C=O, then perhaps it's formed from a reaction involving Cl and C. Let me think.

Reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E.

If E is Cl2C=O, then C would have to be something that when reacts with D (maybe Cl2) forms Cl2C=O.

Wait, perhaps C is CO, and D is Cl2. Then, CO + Cl2 → ClCOCl (phosgene), but the reaction conditions would matter. Alternatively, the actual reaction could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorinated compound. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about E as O3. O3 is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry.

In reaction 2, C reacts with D to form O3. So perhaps C is O2 and D is something else that provides the additional O.

But in reaction 1, A + 8 B → C (O2?), which doesn't make sense because C is O2 in that case. Then reaction 2 would be O2 + D → O3. How?

Wait, perhaps in reaction 2, C is O2 and D is another O-containing gas, like O2 itself. But that doesn't make sense for forming O3.

Alternatively, perhaps C is another O-containing compound, like ozone, but that's getting circular.

Wait, perhaps I'm not on the right track. Let me think of another possibility.

If E is SO2, which has a bent structure and C2v symmetry. That would fit option D.

So, if E is SO2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → SO2.

Then, what would C and D be?

If C is a sulfur compound, like S, and D is O2. Then, S + O2 → SO2. But that's a 1:1 ratio in reaction 2. But in the question, reaction 2 uses 2 equivalents of D. So perhaps the reaction is S + 2 O2 → SO2. But that would require 2 O2 per S, which would make sense.

Wait, but the reaction would produce SO2, which is a gas. But in reaction 1, C is a bright red product. SO2 is a colorless gas, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe E isn't SO2.

Wait, another thought: Maybe E is Cl2O, which is a chlorinated oxide. Cl2O has a structure similar to O3, with a bent shape and C2v symmetry.

So, if E is Cl2O, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → Cl2O.

What could C and D be?

Perhaps C is ClO2 and D is something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is Cl2 and D is O2. But then, reaction would be Cl2 + O2 → Cl2O. Not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorine compound, and D is O2. Then, reaction would be C + 2 O2 → Cl2O. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Let me try to summarize what I know so far.

- Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red).
- Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous).
- Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).
- Reaction 4: B + D → H (solvent), 1:1 ratio.

From reaction 4, H is a solvent. If the reaction is between B and D to form H, which is a solvent.

If H is H2O, then B and D must react to form water. So possible reactions are:

- 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So B is O2, D is H2, H is H2O. But the ratio is 2 H2 : 1 O2 → 2 H2O. So for reaction 4, the ratio is 2:1, but the question says 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if B is H2 and D is O2, but again, same issue.

Another possibility: B is CO2 and D is H2O. But they don't react.

Hmm, maybe B is NH3 and D is something else, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps H is ethanol. But then, what's the reaction between B and D to form ethanol? It would require more specific gases.

Wait, perhaps reaction 4 is B + D → H (solvent). If H is ethanol, then B and D would have to be something like ethylene oxide and water, but that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps H is methanol. Then, B and D would have to react to form methanol. But which gases would do that? Maybe CO and H2. The reaction would be CO + 2 H2 → CH3OH. So in that case, B is H2, D is CO. Reaction 4 would be H2 + CO → CH3OH. But that's a 1:1 ratio, which fits. So B is H2, D is CO, H is CH3OH.

That could be possible. Let me see how that fits into the other reactions.

Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. B is H2, so A + 8 H2 → C (bright red).

What reaction could that be? Perhaps A is a metal, and H2 is the reducing agent. The product C is bright red.

Wait, for example, if A is CuO and H2 is the reducing agent, then CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O. But that's not forming a bright red product.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal oxide, and reaction with H2 forms a metal and water. But I'm not seeing the bright red product.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps A is a metal, and H2 is reacting to form a metal hydride. But I'm not sure about the bright red.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a non-metal, like phosphorus, and H2 is reacting via combustion. But that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps A is Fe3O4, and H2 is reducing it. Fe3O4 + 4 H2 → 3 Fe + 4 H2O. But that would give Fe, which is not bright red.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working. Let me think about reaction 3 again.

C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

If H is CH3OH, then perhaps D is CO and B is H2.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should instead think about the symmetry groups again.

The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If E is a linear molecule, it's D∞h. If E is a bent molecule, it's C2v. If E has a two-fold axis, it's C2. If E has a four-fold axis, D4h.

Given that E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a gas like phosgene, which is Cl2C=O. As I thought earlier, phosgene has a bent structure, so C2v symmetry (option D).

In that case, what would E's structure be?

Phosgene (Cl2CO) has a structure where the central carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. The molecule is planar and bent, similar to O3. So its point group is C2v.

So, if E is phosgene, then its symmetry group is C2v.

Now, does this fit into the reactions?

Reaction 2: C reacts with 2 D → E (phosgene).

If D is Cl2, then perhaps C is CO.

Reaction 2: CO + 2 Cl2 → Cl2CO (phosgene). But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry here. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is C + 2 Cl2 → Cl2CO.

But in that case, C would be CO.

In reaction 1, A + 8 B → C (CO). B is H2, as per reaction 4 (if H is CH3OH, then B is H2 and D is CO).

So reaction 1: A + 8 H2 → CO.

What reaction produces CO with H2? Maybe the reduction of a metal oxide. For example, FeO + H2 → Fe + H2O. But that produces Fe, not CO.

Alternatively, perhaps C is CO, and reaction 1 is the oxidation of a metal with H2 to produce CO. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is CO, and reaction 3 is CO + H2O → A + F + G.

What would that imply? CO + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

But CO and H2O don't react under normal conditions. Unless under high pressure or catalyst, like in the water-gas shift reaction: CO + H2O → CO2 + H2. But that's not producing acids.

Hmm, perhaps this line of thought isn't working. Maybe I should consider that E is a different compound.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible answers and what their symmetry groups are.

Option D is C2v. So the answer would be D.

But I'm not entirely certain about the reactions, but considering that E likely has a bent structure, C2v symmetry makes sense. Therefore, the answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the formation of product E, which is described as extremely hazardous. The goal is to determine the molecular symmetry group of E from the given options: **C2**, **D4h**, **D∞h**, and **C2v**.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**:  
   Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form a bright red product C.  
   - The bright red color suggests a compound like sulfur trioxide (SO₃) or a transition metal compound, but the exact identity of C remains unclear.  

2. **Reaction 2**:  
   C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous.  
   - E is likely a toxic or reactive compound. A plausible candidate is **phosgene (Cl₂C=O)**, which is a toxic gas with a bent structure and **C2v symmetry**.  

3. **Reaction 3**:  
   C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak).  
   - If C is an anhydride, its hydrolysis could yield two acids. For example, if C is a mixed anhydride like (HNO₃)(H₂SO₄), hydrolysis would yield HNO₃ (strong acid) and H₂SO₄ (strong acid). However, this does not perfectly align with the description of F and G.  

4. **Reaction 4**:  
   Gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.  
   - A plausible interpretation is that D and B could be gases like CO and H₂, respectively, forming a solvent like methanol (CH₃OH).  

5. **Symmetry Group of E**:  
   - If E is phosgene (Cl₂C=O), it has a bent structure with a two-fold rotation axis (C2) and a vertical mirror plane (σv), making its symmetry group **C2v**.  
   - This aligns with the description of E as extremely hazardous and fits the molecular geometry of phosgene.

### Conclusion:  
Based on the reactions and the molecular structure of phosgene, the symmetry group of E is **C2v**.
