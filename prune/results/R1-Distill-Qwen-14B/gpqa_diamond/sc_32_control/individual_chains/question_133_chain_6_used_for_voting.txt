Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? 

The solution has 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I remember that these are phosphate buffer components. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. 

Wait, so I think these two salts are going to form a buffer solution. Because when you mix a weak acid with its conjugate base, you get a buffer. In this case, H3PO4 is the acid, and the salts are providing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. 

Let me think about the dissociation of H3PO4. It has three dissociation steps:
1. H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
2. H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
3. HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- ions. That's the third dissociation step, which has a very small Ka. But wait, if the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, then maybe PO4^3- comes from that second dissociation? Or perhaps I need to consider all the equilibria.

Wait, no. The PO4^3- concentration would be from the third dissociation of HPO4^2-.

But wait, the solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me calculate the moles of each.

First, calculate moles of KH2PO4. Molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007346 mol. Since KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-. So moles of H2PO4^- is 0.007346.

Next, moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O. Molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 ≈ 0.005616 mol. Na2HPO4 dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-. So moles of HPO4^2- is 0.005616.

Wait, but the solution is in 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. So the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007346 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03673 M
[HPO4^2-] = 0.005616 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02808 M

So this is a buffer solution of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The buffer equation is the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. But wait, what's the relevant pKa here? Since H2PO4^- is the acid (donating a proton to become HPO4^2-), the pKa would be the second one, Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21.

Wait, but wait, the Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the acid is H2PO4^- (since it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-), and the base is HPO4^2-. So [base] is [HPO4^2-] = 0.02808 M, [acid] is [H2PO4^-] = 0.03673 M.

Wait, no, wait another second. Let me think again. The reaction is H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-. So in the buffer, H2PO4^- is the acid, and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base. So the ratio [base]/[acid] is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02808 / 0.03673 ≈ 0.764.

So pH = pKa2 + log(0.764). Let me compute log(0.764). Log(0.764) is negative. Let me calculate it: log(0.764) ≈ -0.115. So pH = 7.21 - 0.115 ≈ 7.095.

But why do I need the pH? Because the PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-: HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-. So the concentration of PO4^3- will depend on the pH and the second dissociation.

Wait, but the concentration of PO4^3- is going to be very low because Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is a very small value. So maybe the PO4^3- concentration is determined by the third dissociation step, but considering the pH of the solution.

Alternatively, perhaps we can calculate the concentration of PO4^3- using the third dissociation.

Let me think: The solution's pH is around 7.1. Let me see if that's correct. The pH is about 7.095.

The reaction for the third dissociation: HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-. The Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So, the concentration of PO4^3- will be determined by the concentration of HPO4^2- and the pH.

The expression is Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

We know Ka3 is 1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02808 M, and [H+] can be found from the solution's pH.

Wait, the pH is approximately 7.095, so [H+] = 10^(-pH) ≈ 10^(-7.095) ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

So plugging in the numbers:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / 8.21e-8.

Let me compute numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.02808 ≈ 5.0544e-14.

Divide by 8.21e-8: 5.0544e-14 / 8.21e-8 ≈ 6.155e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, option D is 3.97e-7. Hmm, 6.15e-7 is close to 6.24e-7.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the pH calculation. Let me double-check that.

Earlier, I calculated [H2PO4^-] = ~0.03673 M and [HPO4^2-] = ~0.02808 M.

So the ratio [base]/[acid] is 0.02808 / 0.03673 ≈ 0.764.

pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) = log(6.2) + log(1e-8) = 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076? Wait, wait no. Wait, 6.2e-8 is 6.2 x 10^-8, so pKa is -log(6.2e-8).

Log(6.2) is about 0.7924, so pKa2 is 7.2076.

So pH = 7.2076 + log(0.764). Log(0.764) is about -0.115, so pH ≈ 7.2076 - 0.115 = 7.0926.

So [H+] is 10^(-7.0926) ≈ 8.23e-8.

So in the calculation: 1.8e-12 * 0.02808 = 5.0544e-14.

Divide by 8.23e-8: 5.0544e-14 / 8.23e-8 = approximately 6.14e-7 M.

So that's around 6.14e-7. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. So maybe I should choose option A.

Wait, but wait another point. When I mix KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, are there any other factors? For example, the total concentration of phosphate species might affect the activity coefficients, but I think for this problem, we can ignore that and proceed with the ideal solution assumption.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the PO4^3- comes from the third dissociation, but in a solution where HPO4^2- is present. So, the concentration depends on the pH, as we've calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the step before, that is, the second dissociation.

Wait, the HPO4^2- comes from the dissociation of H2PO4^-. So maybe I should model all the equilibria.

Let me think again. In the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The system is governed by the following equilibria:

1. H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
2. HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

Since we have a buffer solution, the H+ concentration is determined by the first equilibrium, as we calculated.

But then, the second equilibrium will determine the PO4^3- concentration based on the H+ from the first step.

So, yes, the approach I took earlier is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use exact expressions.

Let me denote [HPO4^2-] as 0.02808 M, but wait, that's the initial concentration before any dissociation. But in reality, some HPO4^2- will dissociate into PO4^3- and H+.

Wait, but considering that Ka3 is very small (1.8e-12), the degree of dissociation will be minimal. So, the change in [HPO4^2-] will be negligible compared to the initial concentration. So, we can approximate [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.02808 M.

So, PO4^3- concentration is (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Plugging the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02808 M

[H+] = 8.23e-8 M

So,

PO4^3- = (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / 8.23e-8

Calculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02808 = 5.0544e-14.

Divide by 8.23e-8:

5.0544e-14 / 8.23e-8 = (5.0544 / 8.23) * 1e-6.

5.0544 / 8.23 ≈ 0.614.

So 0.614e-6 = 6.14e-7 M.

Hmm, so the concentration is approximately 6.14e-7 M.

Looking back at the options:

A) 6.24x10^-7 M

B) 5.48x10^-7 M 

C) 2.81x10^-7 M

D) 3.97x10^-7 M 

So 6.14e-7 is closest to option A (6.24e-7) but not exactly. Maybe there was some rounding during calculations.

Wait, maybe I should be more precise with the pH calculation.

Let me recalculate the pH. Let's compute it more accurately.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.03673 M

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02808 M

The ratio [base]/[acid] is 0.02808 / 0.03673 = let me compute it exactly.

0.02808 ÷ 0.03673.

Let me compute 2808 / 3673.

3673 * 0.76 ≈ 2800, so 0.764 as before.

But for more precision, let's compute 2808 ÷ 3673.

3673 × 0.764 = 3673 *0.7=2571.1, 3673*0.06=220.38, 3673*0.004=14.692. Sum: 2571.1 +220.38=2791.48 +14.692=2806.172. Close to 2808. So 0.764 gives us 2806.17, which is 1.828 less than 2808. So, 1.828 /3673 ≈ 0.000497. So the ratio is approximately 0.764 + 0.000497 ≈ 0.7645.

So log(0.7645) = ?

Using log(0.7645) ≈ ln(0.7645)/ln(10). ln(0.7645)= about -0.268. ln(10)=2.3026. So -0.268 /2.3026 ≈ -0.1163.

So pH = pKa2 + log(ratio) = 7.2076 + (-0.1163) ≈ 7.0913.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.0913) = approximately 8.23e-8 M.

So plugging back into the PO4^3- concentration:

(1.8e-12 * 0.02808) /8.23e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02808 = 5.0544e-14.

5.0544e-14 /8.23e-8 = (5.0544 /8.23 ) * 1e-6.

5.0544 ÷8.23: 8.23 × 0.614=5.05382. So 0.614.

So 0.614e-6 = 6.14e-7 M.

Which is about 6.14e-7. The closest option is A) 6.24e-7. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the molar masses.

Let me recalculate the moles:

KH2PO4: 1.00 g /136.09 g/mol.

136.09 g is the molar mass.

1.00 /136.09 = approximately 0.007346 mol, as before.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g /177.99 g/mol.

177.99 g/mol.

1.00 /177.99 ≈ 0.005616 mol.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact concentration in the solution.

Wait, the solution is 200 cm³, so 0.2 L.

So [H2PO4^-] = 0.007346 / 0.2 = 0.03673 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005616 / 0.2 = 0.02808 M.

Yes, so that part is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution is at pH where the third dissociation is significant. But considering that PO4^3- is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-, and given how small Ka3 is, the concentration would be very low.

Alternatively, perhaps the given choices are expecting the use of the Hendersen equation for the third ionization. But that doesn't make sense, as the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, not HPO4^2- and PO4^3-.

Wait, another approach: using the relation between the species in the solution.

The concentration of PO4^3- can be found via the third dissociation equation.

We have:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange this to [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

We have [HPO4^2-] = 0.02808 M, [H+] is 8.23e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / 8.23e-8.

Which is the same as before.

Wait, maybe if I use more precise numbers.

Compute 1.8e-12 *0.02808 = 5.0544e-14.

5.0544e-14 / 8.23e-8 = (5.0544 /8.23 ) *1e-6.

5.0544 /8.23 = let me compute more accurately.

8.23 ) 5.0544 

8.23 * 0.6 = 4.938. Subtract: 5.0544 -4.938=0.1164.

Bring down a zero: 0.1164 → 1.164.

8.23 * 0.014 = 0.11522.

Subtract: 1.164 -1.1522 =0.0118.

So 0.614? So 0.614e-6 is 6.14e-7.

Hmm, so why is option D 3.97e-7? That's almost half of what I got. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the orthophosphate comes from the third ion, and in the solution, the concentration of PO4^3- is determined by both the third dissociation and any other reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the total phosphate species and charge balance.

Wait, let's think about the charge balance.

The solution must be electrically neutral. So the sum of the cations' concentrations times their charges must equal the sum of the anions' concentrations times their charges.

In the solution, the main cations are K+ and Na+.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So:

[ K+ ] = 0.03673 M (from KH2PO4).

[ Na+ ] = 2 * 0.02808 M = 0.05616 M (from Na2HPO4).

So total cations: [K+] + [Na+] = 0.03673 +0.05616 =0.09289 M.

The anions are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- and PO4^3-.

[H2PO4^-] =0.03673 M.

[HPO4^2-] =0.02808 M.

[PO4^3-] = x (what we're trying to find).

The charge from anions is:

(0.03673 * 1) + (0.02808 *2 ) + (x *3 ) = [Anion charge].

Cation charge is 0.09289 *1 = 0.09289.

So:

0.03673 + 0.05616 + 3x = 0.09289.

Wait, 0.02808 *2 is 0.05616. 0.03673 + 0.05616 =0.09289. So:

0.09289 + 3x = 0.09289.

Wait, that implies that 3x=0, so x=0. But that can't be right because PO4^3- should have some concentration.

Hmm, but that suggests that PO4^3- is zero. But that's not possible because in reality, the solution would have some PO4^3- and maybe other species.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some other anions. For example, OH^- in the solution? But at pH ~7, [OH^-] is 1e-7 M. So perhaps the charge balance equation includes that.

Let me write the charge balance equation accurately.

Charge balance equation: sum (cations) = sum (anions)

Cations: K+ and Na+. 

[K+] = 0.03673 M.

[Na+] = 2 *0.02808 =0.05616 M.

So total cations: 0.03673 +0.05616 =0.09289 M.

Anions: H2PO4^- (0.03673 M), HPO4^2- (0.02808 M), PO4^3- (x), and OH^- (1e-7 M).

Charge from anions:

(0.03673 *1) + (0.02808 *2) + (x *3) + (OH^- *1) = sum.

So:

0.03673 + 0.05616 + 3x + 1e-7 = 0.09289 +3x + 1e-7.

So sum of anions' charge: 0.09289 +3x +1e-7.

Sum of cations' charge: 0.09289.

So:

0.09289 +3x +1e-7 = 0.09289.

Subtract 0.09289 from both sides:

3x +1e-7 =0.

Which implies x= - (1e-7)/3 ≈ -3.33e-8.

Wait, that can't be possible. Negative concentration? That must mean I made a mistake in the charge balance.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the solution has H+ as well, which is an anion? No, H+ is a cation. So the anions are H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-, and OH^-.

Wait, but in the charge balance, the sum of positive charges equals sum of negative charges:

Sum(cations) = Sum(anions).

Sum(cations) = 0.09289 M (from K+ and Na+).

Sum(anions) = [H2PO4^-] + 2*[HPO4^2-] + 3*[PO4^3-] + [OH^-].

So:

0.09289 = 0.03673 + 2*(0.02808) +3x + [OH^-].

Compute 0.03673 + 2*(0.02808) =0.03673 +0.05616=0.09289.

So:

0.09289 = 0.09289 +3x + [OH^-].

Subtract 0.09289 from both sides:

0 =3x + [OH^-].

Which gives:

3x = - [OH^-].

So 3x = - [OH^-].

But x is [PO4^3-], which can't be negative. So the only way this holds is if [OH^-] is negative, which it's not. Hence, there must be a mistake in this approach.

Ah, I think I see the problem. The mistake is that the HPO4^2- and PO4^3- are part of a larger system, and the charge balance isn't just between the cations and these anions. Because H+ is a cation, it contributes to the cation charge. So the correct charge balance equation should include H+.

Let me write it again:

Sum of cation charges = Sum of anion charges.

Cations: K+, Na+, H+.

Anions: H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-, OH^-.

So:

[K+] + [Na+] + [H+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] + 3[PO4^3-] + [OH^-].

We know that [K+] =0.03673, [Na+] =0.05616, [H2PO4^-]=0.03673, [HPO4^2-]=0.02808, [PO4^3-]=x, [OH^-]=1e-7 (approximate at pH 7).

So plug in the values:

0.03673 + 0.05616 + [H+] = 0.03673 + 2*(0.02808) +3x +1e-7.

Simplify left side: 0.09289 + [H+].

Right side: 0.03673 + 0.05616 = 0.09289 +3x +1e-7.

So:

0.09289 + [H+] = 0.09289 +3x +1e-7.

Subtract 0.09289 from both sides:

[H+] =3x +1e-7.

So [H+] =3x +1e-7.

But from earlier, we have [H+] =8.23e-8.

So 8.23e-8 =3x +1e-7.

Solving for x:

3x =8.23e-8 -1e-7 = (8.23e-8 -10e-8) = (-1.77e-8).

So x= (-1.77e-8)/3 ≈ -5.9e-9.

Wait, that can't be right since concentration can't be negative. So that suggests a mistake in the approach.

Ah, I think I messed up the charge balance equation. Because in reality, the solution's pH is determined by the buffer, and [H+] is not negligible compared to [OH^-], especially in neutral solution.

Wait, perhaps I should express [OH^-] in terms of [H+].

We know that [H+][OH^-] = 1e-14.

So [OH^-] = 1e-14 / [H+].

So substituting back into the charge balance equation:

[H+] =3x + (1e-14)/[H+].

Multiply both sides by [H+]:

[H+]^2 =3x [H+] +1e-14.

But from the earlier calculation, [H+] is approximately 8.23e-8. Let me plug that in.

Left side: (8.23e-8)^2 ≈6.77e-15.

Right side:3x*(8.23e-8) +1e-14.

So,

6.77e-15 ≈ 2.47e-8 x +1e-14.

Subtract 1e-14:

6.77e-15 -1e-14 = 6.77e-15 -10e-15 = -3.23e-15.

So,

-3.23e-15 ≈ 2.47e-8 x.

So x ≈ (-3.23e-15)/(2.47e-8) ≈ -1.31e-7 M.

Negative again. Hmm, that can't be right. So perhaps this approach isn't working, indicating that the assumption that [PO4^3-] is x is not correct, or that I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that [HPO4^2-] is 0.02808 M is incorrect because some of it dissociates into PO4^3-.

But earlier, we considered that because Ka3 is so small, the dissociation is negligible, so [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.02808, but perhaps this isn't true. But if the solution's pH is around 7.09, which is higher than pKa3?

Wait, pKa3 is log(1.8e-12) ≈ 11.74. So the pH is 7.09, which is much lower than pKa3. So the solution is in the range where HPO4^2- is predominantly in the form of H2PO4^-? No, wait. Because the pH is below pKa3, the predominant species would be H2PO4^- from HPO4^2-.

Wait, no: for the third dissociation, HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-. So if pH < pKa3, then the solution tends to have more HPO4^2- (since H+ is higher, shifts to left). But when pH is higher than pKa3, PO4^3- is more prevalent.

Since pH is 7.09, and pKa3 is ~11.74, pH is much lower than pKa3, so HPO4^2- remains mostly as HPO4^2-.

So the assumption that [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.02808 M is correct, as dissociation into PO4^3- is minimal. So the initial approach to calculate PO4^3- via Ka3 is valid.

But then why does the charge balance give a negative x? Perhaps because the initial assumption that [HPO4^2-] is 0.02808 M is incorrect, because some of it dissociates into PO4^3-.

Wait, but if PO4^3- is 6.14e-7 M, as calculated, then the change in [HPO4^2-] due to dissociation would be negligible, as 6.14e-7 is much smaller than 0.02808.

So perhaps the charge balance approach isn't converging because other factors are negligible compared to the initial concentrations.

Alternatively, perhaps the charge balance isn't necessary for this problem, and the initial approach is sufficient.

Given that, and that the calculation gives approximately 6.14e-7, matching option A which is 6.24e-7, I think that's the correct answer.

So the answer should be A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the system using the given data and equilibrium principles. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ (molar mass = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (molar mass = 177.99 g/mol) in 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). These salts provide H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ ions, forming a buffer system. The dissociation constants for phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) are:

- Ka₁ = 7.5 × 10⁻³  
- Ka₂ = 6.2 × 10⁻⁸  
- Ka₃ = 1.8 × 10⁻¹²  

### Step 1: Calculate moles and concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007346 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Since KH₂PO₄ dissociates into K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻, the concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ is:  
  \[
  [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{0.007346}{0.2} \approx 0.03673 \, \text{M}.
  \]

- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005616 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Since Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissociates into 2Na⁺ and HPO₄²⁻, the concentration of HPO₄²⁻ is:  
  \[
  [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{0.005616}{0.2} \approx 0.02808 \, \text{M}.
  \]

### Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base), with the relevant equilibrium constant being Ka₂ = 6.2 × 10⁻⁸. The pKa₂ is:  
\[
\text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.21.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}\right),
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + \log\left(\frac{0.02808}{0.03673}\right).
\]

The ratio \( \frac{0.02808}{0.03673} \approx 0.764 \), and \( \log(0.764) \approx -0.115 \). Thus:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 - 0.115 \approx 7.095.
\]

The hydrogen ion concentration is:  
\[
[\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} \approx 10^{-7.095} \approx 8.23 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the concentration of PO₄³⁻
The third dissociation of HPO₄²⁻ is:  
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}, \quad \text{Ka}_3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}.
\]

Using the equilibrium expression:  
\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}.
\]

Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}.
\]

Substitute the values:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02808)}{8.23 \times 10^{-8}}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:  
\[
(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02808) \approx 5.0544 \times 10^{-14}.
\]

Then, divide by \( 8.23 \times 10^{-8} \):  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.0544 \times 10^{-14}}{8.23 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.14 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately \( 6.14 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which is closest to option **A) 6.24 × 10⁻⁷ M**. The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding during intermediate calculations.
