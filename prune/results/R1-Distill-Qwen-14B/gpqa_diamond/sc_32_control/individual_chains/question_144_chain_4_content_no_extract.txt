Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The question is about a meson resonance, X. I need to find the mean decay distance. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with a specific value in meters.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that particles like mesons can decay, and their mean decay length depends on their lifetime and velocity. Oh right, decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. The formula I think is something like L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is the velocity over the speed of light, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

Wait, but how do I get tau? Oh, I think tau is related to the particle's width. The width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / tau, so tau = ħ / Γ. But wait, units might be an issue here. I need to make sure all the units are consistent.

Let me jot down the knowns:

- E_X = 8 GeV
- m_X = 1.2 GeV
- Γ_X = 320 MeV

Wait, the units for E and m are in GeV, and Γ is in MeV. I should convert them all to the same unit, probably to GeV or MeV. Maybe GeV is easier since E and m are in that.

So Γ is 0.32 GeV.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the formula for the mean decay distance. Let me think again. The mean lifetime is tau = ħ / Γ. Then, the decay length L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

But first, I need to find gamma and beta. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c²) but wait, since E is given as the total energy, yeah. Hmm, actually, E = gamma m c². So gamma = E/(m c²). But wait, E and m are in units that include c², so perhaps the calculation can be done in natural units where c=1, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, no, when you have E and m in energy terms, the formula for gamma is E/(m c²). But I think in particle physics, people often use units where c=1, so E in GeV, m in GeV/c², but when c=1, E (GeV) = m (GeV/c²) * c², so E = m, but I'm getting confused. Maybe I should proceed step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the lifetime first, then find gamma and beta, then compute L.

So, let's compute tau first. Tau = ħ / Γ. Let me remember the value of ħ. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. But ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But I need to convert this into appropriate units because Γ is given in GeV.

Wait, I think it's easier to use natural units where ħ = c = 1, but then the conversion factors when going back to meters would be needed. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula L = (c * tau) * (gamma * beta). 

Wait, maybe another approach. The mean lifetime tau is related to the particle's width by the equation tau = ħ / Γ. So, substituting the numbers, but I need to be careful about units.

Let me get all units consistent. Let's convert everything into SI units.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV. Wait, no, the width Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

But GeV is a unit of energy. So, to get tau in seconds, I need to compute ħ in GeV·s.

I recall that ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. Because 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, and ħ is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s. Wait, no, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, Planck's constant h is 6.62607015e-34 J·s. So ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

But 1 J = 1 kg·m²/s². So, to convert ħ into units of GeV·s, I need to express ħ in GeV·s.

1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 1 GeV = 1.602e-10 J.

So, ħ in GeV·s would be:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) * (1 GeV / 1.602e-10 J) )^(-1) 

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it properly.

Wait, 1 GeV = 1e9 eV = 1e9 * 1.602e-19 J = 1.602e-10 J.

So, ħ in GeV·s is:

ħ (GeV·s) = ħ (J·s) / (1 GeV / 1.602e-10 J) )

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think in terms of unit conversion.

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

We can express ħ in GeV·s by using the conversion factor between J and GeV.

1 GeV = 1.602e-10 J.

So, 1 J = 1 / 1.602e-10 GeV = approx 6.2415e9 GeV.

So, ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s = 1.0545718e-34 * (6.2415e9 GeV) ) * s 

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me correct that.

Wait, 1 J = 1/(1.602e-10) GeV = approximately 6.2415e9 GeV.

So, 1 J·s = 6.2415e9 GeV·s.

Thus, ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s = 1.0545718e-34 * 6.2415e9 GeV·s.

Calculating that: 1.0545718e-34 * 6.2415e9 ≈ (1.0545718 * 6.2415) x 1e-25.

1.0545718 * 6.2415 ≈ approximately 6.582. So, ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Yes, that's the value I remember. So, ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s.

So, tau = ħ / Γ.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

Tau = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that division: 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. Yes.

Next, I need to find the gamma factor. Gamma is E/(m c²). Wait, but in natural units where c=1, and E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c²? Or wait, in natural units, E and m have the same units when c=1.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. So, E is the total energy of the particle, which is 8 GeV. The rest mass is 1.2 GeV/c², right? So when calculating gamma, which is E/(m c²), but if E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c², then E/(m c²) would have units of (GeV)/( (GeV/c²) * c² ) ) = GeV/(GeV) )= dimensionless, which is correct for gamma.

But wait, in natural units where c=1, E (GeV) = m (GeV/c²) * c² → so E = m. So perhaps in natural units, E and m are numerically the same when c=1. So gamma would be E/m.

So, gamma = E/(m c²) → but if E is given as 8 GeV, m as 1.2 GeV/c², then E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV/c² * c² ) ) → 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is approximately 6.6667.

But wait, alternatively, when using natural units where c=1, E and m have the same numerical value, so E = m → but here E is 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV. So E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV → gamma = E/(m) = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Yes, makes sense. So gamma is 8 /1.2 = 20/3 ≈ 6.6667.

Now, beta. Beta is v/c. How to find beta?

We can use the relation between gamma, beta, and mass. The relation is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²).

Alternatively, from energy and momentum: E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

We can find p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2).

But again, in natural units, perhaps it's easier. But let's proceed.

In natural units, E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4. Wait, no, more accurately, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 → so, (pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc²)^2.

So, p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c²)^2 ) → but in units where c=1, this is p = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 ). So, in natural units, p = sqrt(8^2 - 1.2^2) GeV. Let's compute that.

8^2 =64, 1.2^2=1.44 → 64 -1.44=62.56 → sqrt(62.56)= approx 7.91 GeV.

So, p =7.91 GeV/c.

Then, beta = (p c)/(E). Because, in natural units, beta = p c / E → since E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v → so beta = v/c = (p c)/E.

So, beta = (p c) / E.

Wait, in our case, p is 7.91 GeV/c. So p c = 7.91 GeV/c * c = 7.91 GeV.

So, beta = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) ) = 7.91 /8 ≈ 0.98875.

So, beta is approximately 0.98875.

So, now we have gamma ≈6.6667 and beta ≈0.98875.

So, the decay length L is c * tau * gamma * beta.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Decay length L is the product of the particle's speed (v) multiplied by the lifetime (tau). But since the particle is moving, L = v * tau. But since v = beta c, L = beta c tau.

But wait, that's the proper time. Wait, no, the lifetime observed in the lab frame is tau_lab = gamma tau. So, the mean decay length is L = v * tau_lab = beta c * gamma tau.

Yes, that's correct. So, L = beta gamma c tau.

So, putting it all together:

L = beta * gamma * c * tau.

We have beta ≈0.98875, gamma≈6.6667, c is the speed of light ≈3e8 m/s, and tau≈2.056875e-24 seconds.

Let me compute each part.

First, compute beta * gamma: 0.98875 * 6.6667 ≈ let's see. 0.98875 *6 is about 5.9325, 0.98875*0.6667≈ 0.65916, so total approx 6.59166.

So, beta gamma ≈6.59166.

Now, c*tau: 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s → 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (3 * 2.056875) * 1e(8-24) ) → 6.170625e-16 meters.

Wait, 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3 * 2.056875 * 1e8 *1e-24 → 6.170625 * 1e-16 = 6.170625e-16 meters.

So, c tau is 6.170625e-16 m.

Then, L = beta gamma * c tau ≈ 6.59166 * 6.170625e-16 m.

Let me compute 6.59166 *6.170625.

6 * 6 is 36, 6 * 0.170625 ≈1.02375, 0.59166 *6=3.54996, 0.59166 *0.170625≈ 0.1009. So adding up: 36 +1.02375=37.02375, 3.54996+0.1009≈3.65086. Total ≈37.02375 +3.65086≈40.6746.

Wait, but that's an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps 6.59166 *6.170625 is:

Let me compute 6.59166 *6.170625.

But perhaps a better approach is to use exact multiplication.

6.59166 × 6.170625:

Break it down:

6 ×6 =36.

6 ×0.170625=1.02375.

0.59166 ×6=3.54996.

0.59166 ×0.170625≈ let's compute 0.59166 *0.170625.

0.5 *0.170625=0.0853125.

0.09166 *0.170625≈ approximately 0.015625.

So total is 0.0853125 +0.015625=0.1009375.

So all together:

36 +1.02375=37.02375.

37.02375 +3.54996=40.57371.

40.57371 +0.1009375≈40.67465.

So approximately 40.67465.

So, 40.67465e-16 m.

Wait, no, wait. Because 6.59166 * 6.170625e-16 m is 40.67465e-16 m? Wait, no, no. Oh wait, no! Wait, because 6.59166 is multiplied by 6.170625e-16. So the total is 6.59166 *6.170625e-16 = (6.59166 *6.170625) ×1e-16.

Which is 40.67465 ×1e-16 m ≈4.067465e-15 m.

Wait, wait, no, 40.67465e-16 meters is 4.067465e-15 meters, because 40e-16 is 4e-15.

So, L ≈4.067465e-15 meters.

Looking at the options:

Options are:

A)5.0223 *1e-16 m

B)4.0655 *1e-15 m

C)5.0223 *1e-15 m

D)4.0655 *1e-16 m

So, my calculation gives approximately 4.067465e-15 m, which is very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, tau calculation: I had ħ =6.582e-25 GeV·s, Γ=0.32 GeV.

Tau = ħ/Γ = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Then, gamma = E/m =8/1.2=6.666666... ≈6.6667.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) → because in terms of beta, beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E² c^4)} )= sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)}.

So, m=1.2 GeV, E=8 GeV.

So, m²=1.44, E²=64.

1 - (1.44/64) = 1 - 0.0225=0.9775.

beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887.

So that part is correct.

Then, L = beta * gamma * c * tau.

Wait, c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

c*tau = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 meters.

Then, beta gamma is 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈6.5916.

Multiply that by c tau: 6.5916 *6.170625e-16 = ?

Calculating 6.5916 *6.170625:

6 *6=36, 6 *0.170625=1.02375, 0.5916 *6=3.5496, 0.5916 *0.170625≈0.1009.

Adding up: 36 +1.02375=37.02375 → 37.02375 +3.5496=40.57335 → 40.57335 +0.1009=40.67425.

So, 40.67425e-16 m =4.067425e-15 m.

Which is about 4.067e-15 m. The option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. The slight difference may be due to more precise calculation of beta and gamma.

Wait, perhaps I used too many approximations. Let me compute beta more accurately.

Compute beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)} = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775).

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) accurately.

0.9775 → let's take a calculator approach. 0.98^2=0.9604, 0.988^2= (approx) 0.988 *0.988.

0.98 *0.98 =0.9604, 0.008 *0.98 =0.00784, 0.008*0.98=0.00784, and 0.008^2=0.000064. So (0.98 +0.008)^2 = 0.98² + 2*0.98*0.008 + 0.008²=0.9604 + 0.01568 + 0.000064=0.976144.

Hmm, but 0.9775 is higher than 0.976144. So, let's compute 0.988^2= 0.976144, which is less than 0.9775. Let's compute 0.989^2.

0.989^2 = (0.98 +0.009)^2 = 0.98² + 2*0.98*0.009 +0.009² = 0.9604 + 0.01764 +0.000081 = 0.9604 +0.01764=0.97804 + 0.000081=0.978121.

So 0.989^2 is 0.978121, which is larger than 0.9775.

So, the square root of 0.9775 is between 0.988 and 0.989.

Let me compute 0.9885^2:

0.9885 = 0.988 +0.0005.

(0.988 +0.0005)^2 = 0.988^2 + 2*0.988*0.0005 + (0.0005)^2.

We know 0.988^2 is 0.976144.

2*0.988*0.0005 = 0.988 *0.001=0.000988.

(0.0005)^2=0.00000025.

Total: 0.976144 +0.000988 =0.977132 +0.00000025=0.97713225.

But target is 0.9775.

Difference: 0.9775-0.97713225=0.00036775.

So, to find how much more than 0.9885 is needed.

Let me denote x=0.9885 + delta.

We have (0.9885 + delta)^2 ≈ 0.9775.

Approximating using delta <<1:

(0.9885)^2 + 2 *0.9885 * delta =0.9775 → 0.97713225 + 1.977 * delta=0.9775.

So, 1.977 * delta = 0.9775 -0.97713225=0.00036775.

delta=0.00036775 /1.977 ≈ 0.0001863.

So, x≈0.9885 +0.0001863=0.9886863.

So, sqrt(0.9775)=≈0.988686.

So, beta=0.988686.

Now, gamma=8/1.2=6.666666...=20/3≈6.666666667.

So, beta*gamma=6.66666667 * 0.988686.

Let me compute this accurately.

6.66666667 * 0.988686 = ?

Well, 6 * 0.988686 =5.932116.

0.66666667 *0.988686 = approx 0.66666667 *0.988686 → computing 2/3 * 0.988686 → approx 0.659124.

So, 5.932116 +0.659124=6.59124.

So beta*gamma=6.59124.

Now, tau=2.056875e-24 s.

c=3e8 m/s.

c*tau=3e8 *2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Then, L= beta gamma * c tau =6.59124 *6.170625e-16.

Compute 6.59124 *6.170625.

Let me compute this multiplication more precisely.

6 *6=36.

6 *0.170625=1.02375.

0.59124 *6=3.54744.

0.59124 *0.170625 → let's compute this.

0.5 *0.170625=0.0853125.

0.09124 *0.170625 → approx 0.01556.

So, 0.0853125 +0.01556=0.0100875? Wait, no, 0.0853125 +0.01556=0.1008725.

Wait, no, wait: 0.59124 is 0.5 +0.09124.

So 0.5 *0.170625=0.0853125.

0.09124 *0.170625 → compute 0.09124 *0.170625.

0.09 *0.17=0.0153.

0.09 *0.000625=0.00005625.

0.00124 *0.17=0.0002108.

0.00124 *0.000625=0.000000775.

Adding these:

0.0153 + 0.00005625=0.01535625.

0.0002108 + 0.000000775=0.000211575.

Total: 0.01535625 +0.000211575=0.015567825.

So, 0.59124 *0.170625=0.0853125 +0.015567825=0.100880325.

So, the four terms are:

36 (from 6*6)

1.02375 (from 6*0.170625)

3.54744 (from 0.59124 *6)

0.100880325 (from 0.59124 *0.170625)

Adding all together:

36 +1.02375 =37.02375.

37.02375 +3.54744=40.57119.

40.57119 +0.100880325=40.672070325.

So, 6.59124 *6.170625=40.672070325.

So, L=40.672070325e-16 m =4.0672070325e-15 m.

Rounded to four decimal places, that's 4.0672e-15 m.

Looking at the options again:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, so why the small discrepancy? Perhaps I should check the calculation of beta*gamma more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta*gamma. Let me compute 6.6666667 *0.988686 precisely.

6.6666667 *0.988686.

Let me compute 6 *0.988686 =5.932116.

0.6666667 *0.988686 → 2/3 *0.988686.

Compute 0.988686 /3=0.329562. Multiply by 2 →0.659124.

So, 5.932116 +0.659124=6.59124 exactly.

So that's correct.

Hmm. Then why is the answer 4.0672e-15 m, and the option is 4.0655e-15 m?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the c*tau product. Let me recalculate c*tau.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So, c*tau=3e8 *2.056875e-24 = (3 *2.056875) *1e(8-24) → 6.170625 *1e-16 → 6.170625e-16 m.

So that's correct.

So, 6.59124 *6.170625e-16 =40.67207e-16=4.067207e-15 m.

But option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Hmm, so perhaps I made a miscalculation in beta or gamma.

Wait, let me recheck gamma.

gamma = E/(m c²) → but in natural units, E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV/c² → E/(m c²) =8/(1.2) =6.666666... correct.

Beta calculation: beta = p c / E.

Wait, another approach to find beta is sqrt(1- (m^2)/(E^2)}.

But perhaps I should use the relation beta = (pc)/E, where p is the momentum.

Alternatively, let me compute p c = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) → but in natural units, with c=1, p c = sqrt(E² -m²) GeV.

So, E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV → p c = sqrt(64 -1.44)=sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV.

So, beta= (p c)/E =7.91/8=0.98875.

Wait, but earlier when I computed beta via sqrt(0.9775), I got 0.988686. Hmm, wait, that's a discrepancy. Which is correct?

Wait, because (p c)^2 = E^2 - m^2 c^4 → when c=1, (p c)^2 = E² - m²).

So, p c = sqrt(64 -1.44)=sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV.

So, beta = (p c)/E =7.91/8=0.98875.

But earlier, when I computed sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)), I got 0.988686.

Wait, let me compute m²/E² again. m=1.2 GeV, E=8 GeV → m²=1.44, E²=64. So m²/E²=0.0225.

1-0.0225=0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775)=0.988686.

Hmm, but according to the other method, beta=7.91/8=0.98875.

Wait, that's a slight discrepancy. Which is correct?

Ah, wait, because when m and E are in GeV, and when we have beta = (p c)/E → but when using natural units, perhaps the calculation is accurate.

Wait, 7.91 /8 is 0.98875.

But sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.988686.

So, which is correct?

Wait, let me compute 0.98875 squared.

0.98875^2 = (0.98 +0.00875)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98 *0.00875 +0.00875^2.

0.98^2=0.9604.

2*0.98*0.00875=0.98 *0.0175=0.01715.

0.00875^2=0.0000765625.

Adding up: 0.9604 +0.01715=0.97755 +0.0000765625=0.9776265625.

Which is higher than 0.9775. So, 0.98875^2=0.9776265625, which is higher than 0.9775.

So, the actual sqrt(0.9775)=x, where x^2=0.9775.

Given that x is between 0.988686 (x^2=0.9775) and 0.98875 (x^2=0.9776265625).

But which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact expression.

beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2 c^4)} ) = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)} ).

So, from this formula, beta should be sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64))=sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.988686.

But from the other approach, it's 7.91/8=0.98875.

So, which is correct?

Ah, perhaps because in the first approach, I neglected that E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → so, when I compute pc = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4), but if I'm using GeV for E and m, but in natural units, c=1, so E and m are in GeV and GeV/c². Wait, this is getting messy.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute beta as (p c) / E, but with p c in GeV.

Because E = gamma m c² → but when c=1, E=gamma m.

And p = gamma m v → so beta = v/c = (p c)/(gamma m c^2) ) = (p c)/(E).

So, yes, beta is (p c)/E.

Which is 7.91 GeV /8 GeV =0.98875.

But wait, in the other approach, we have beta = sqrt(1 - (m c^2)^2/(E^2)} ) → which, with c=1, is sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)} )= sqrt(0.9775)=0.988686.

But why are these two values slightly different? Because (p c) is sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4), which when divided by E gives sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2 c^4)} )= sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)} ), which is the same as the other formula.

Wait, so they should agree. So perhaps an error in calculation.

Wait, wait, I think I see the mistake.

Wait, E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV/c². So, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c²)^2 → but E and m are in different units. E is in GeV, m in GeV/c².

Wait, perhaps I should convert m into GeV as well, considering units.

Wait, the mass m is 1.2 GeV/c².

So, m c² in GeV is 1.2 GeV/c² * c² =1.2 GeV.

So, E=8 GeV.

Thus, (pc)^2 = (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 =64 -1.44=62.56 → pc=7.91 GeV.

So, beta = (p c)/E =7.91/8=0.98875.

But then, beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2 c^4)} )= sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)} ), which is sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)} )=sqrt(1 - 1.44/64)=sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.988686.

Hmm, so why are these two approaches giving slightly different beta?

Ah, because when I compute m^2, I'm using m in GeV/c². But when I compute (m c^2)^2, it's (1.2 GeV/c² * c^2)^2= (1.2 GeV)^2.

So, the formula beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2 c^4)} )= sqrt(1 - m^2/(E^2)} ).

But in reality:

m =1.2 GeV/c² → m c^2=1.2 GeV.

So, (m c^2)^2= (1.2 GeV)^2 =1.44 GeV².

E^2=64 GeV².

So, beta= sqrt(1 -1.44/64)=sqrt(0.9775)=0.988686.

But when I compute beta as (p c)/E, I get pc=7.91 GeV, E=8 GeV → beta=0.98875.

So, which is correct?

Wait, the correct approach is to use beta = (p c)/E, which is 7.91/8=0.98875.

But then, why does the other approach give 0.988686?

Ah, I think I messed up something.

Wait, let me re-calculate sqrt(0.9775).

0.9775 → let's compute it accurately.

Compute sqrt(0.9775):

0.988^2=0.976144.

0.9885^2= (0.988 +0.0005)^2=0.988^2 + 2*0.988*0.0005 +0.0005^2=0.976144 +0.000988 +0.00000025=0.97713225.

0.9775 is 0.00036775 higher.

So, each 0.0001 increase in x leads to an increase in x² of approximately 2x * delta_x.

So, let x=0.9885 → x²=0.97713225.

We need x²=0.9775 → delta_x²=0.9775 -0.97713225=0.00036775.

delta_x ≈ delta_x²/(2x) → 0.00036775/(2*0.9885)=0.00036775/(1.977)≈0.0001863.

So, x=0.9885+0.0001863=0.9886863.

So, sqrt(0.9775)=0.9886863.

But according to the other method, using (p c)/E gives 0.98875.

So, there's a discrepancy of 0.98875 -0.9886863=0.0000637.

Where is this coming from?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of pc.

Wait, pc = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2}.

E=8 GeV, m c^2=1.2 GeV → E^2=64, (m c^2)^2=1.44.

64-1.44=62.56 → sqrt(62.56)=7.91.

Which is correct.

Wait, 7.91^2=62.56?

7.91 *7.91.

7 *7=49.

7 *0.91=6.37.

0.91*7=6.37.

0.91*0.91=0.8281.

So, 7.91^2 = (7 +0.91)^2 =7^2 +2*7*0.91 +0.91^2=49 +12.74 +0.8281=49+12.74=61.74+0.8281=62.5681.

So, 7.91^2=62.5681, which is slightly higher than 62.56.

So, pc= sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV? No, because 7.91^2=62.5681. So, sqrt(62.56)=7.909999... approximately 7.91 GeV.

Wait, so maybe (pc)=7.91 GeV exactly? Because if E is in GeV and m c² is in GeV, then pc is in GeV.

So, beta = pc/E =7.91 /8=0.98875.

But according to the other method, beta is sqrt(0.9775)=0.988686.

So, there's a small discrepancy here. Which is correct?

Hmm, perhaps because using E and m in GeV and GeV/c², but when calculating in natural units, perhaps I need to consider more precise factors.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to not rely on approximations but to compute it precisely.

But for the purposes of this problem, perhaps using beta =0.98875 is more accurate because it's derived directly from the particle's energy and momentum.

So, perhaps I should proceed with beta=0.98875 and gamma=6.666666667.

Then, L= beta * gamma * c * tau.

beta*gamma=6.666666667 *0.98875=6.666666667 *0.98875.

Let me compute that precisely.

6.666666667 *0.98875.

We can compute it as 6.666666667 * (98875/1e5) → but perhaps it's easier to compute 6.666666667 *0.98875.

6.666666667 *0.98875 = ?

Let me compute 6 *0.98875=5.9325.

0.666666667 *0.98875= let's compute:

0.666666667 is 2/3.

2/3 *0.98875= (0.98875 *2)/3 =1.9775 /3=0.6591666667.

So, 5.9325 +0.6591666667=6.5916666667.

So, beta*gamma=6.5916666667.

Now, c*tau=6.170625e-16 m.

So, L=6.5916666667 *6.170625e-16.

Compute 6.5916666667 *6.170625.

Let me compute:

6 *6=36.

6 *0.170625=1.02375.

0.5916666667 *6=3.55.

0.5916666667 *0.170625= as before, 0.100880325.

So, adding all parts:

36 +1.02375=37.02375.

37.02375 +3.55=40.57375.

40.57375 +0.100880325=40.674630325.

So, 40.674630325e-16 m =4.0674630325e-15 m.

So, L≈4.067463e-15 m.

But the closest option is option B:4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, the slight discrepancy may be due to more precise calculation of beta, or perhaps I made an error in the initial values.

Wait, perhaps the initial value of tau was miscalculated.

Tau = ħ / Γ.

We had ħ =6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma=0.32 GeV.

So, tau=6.582e-25 /0.32 = (6.582 /0.32 )e-25 =20.56875e-25 s =2.056875e-24 s.

Which is correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for the mean decay length as L = c * tau * gamma * beta.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is L = c * gamma * beta * tau.

Which is what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

But I think that's the same thing.

Wait, another approach: The mean proper lifetime is tau= ħ/Γ.

The lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau.

The distance traveled is v * (gamma tau) = beta c * gamma tau.

Which is L= beta gamma c tau.

Which is what I used.

So, all steps seem correct, but the answer isn't matching exactly with option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should use exact values with more precise beta.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation of beta is 0.988686, and gamma is 6.666666667.

Beta*gamma=6.666666667 *0.988686=?

Compute precisely:

6.666666667 *0.988686.

=6 *0.988686 +0.666666667 *0.988686.

=5.932116 + (0.666666667 *0.988686).

Compute 0.666666667 *0.988686:

= (2/3) *0.988686 = (0.988686 *2)/3 =1.977372/3=0.659124.

So, 5.932116 +0.659124=6.59124.

So, beta*gamma=6.59124.

Now, c*tau=3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16 m.

So, L=6.59124 *6.170625e-16.

Compute 6.59124 *6.170625= ?

Let me compute 6.59124 ×6.170625.

Compute as:

6.59124 ×6 =39.54744.

6.59124 ×0.170625.

Compute 6.59124 ×0.1 =0.659124.

6.59124 ×0.070625.

0.07 is 0.07, 0.000625 is 0.000625.

6.59124 ×0.07=0.4613868.

6.59124 ×0.000625=0.004119525.

So, adding those: 0.659124 +0.4613868=1.1205108 +0.004119525=1.124630325.

So, 6.59124 ×0.170625=1.124630325.

Total 6.59124 ×6.170625 =39.54744 +1.124630325=40.672070325.

So, L=40.672070325e-16 m=4.0672070325e-15 m.

So, 4.0672e-15 m.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B:4.0655e-15 m.

The difference is about 0.0017e-15, which is small but not negligible. Perhaps due to rounding errors in the calculation of beta and gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for ħ.

Wait, ħ is approximately 6.58233e-25 GeV·s.

If I use 6.58233e-25, then tau=6.58233e-25 /0.32 =20.56978125e-25=2.056978125e-24 s.

So, tau=2.056978125e-24 s.

c*tau=3e8 m/s * 2.056978125e-24 s =6.170934375e-16 m.

Now, beta*gamma=6.59124.

So, L=6.59124 ×6.170934375e-16.

Compute 6.59124 *6.170934375.

6 *6=36.

6 *0.170934375=1.02560625.

0.59124 *6=3.54744.

0.59124 *0.170934375= let's compute.

Compute 0.5 *0.170934375=0.0854671875.

0.09124 *0.170934375= approx 0.01558.

So, 0.0854671875 +0.01558=0.1010471875.

Adding all four parts:

36 +1.02560625=37.02560625.

37.02560625 +3.54744=40.57304625.

40.57304625 +0.1010471875=40.6740934375e-16 m.

So, L=40.6740934375e-16=4.06740934375e-15 m.

Still around 4.0674e-15 m.

So, the options don't have this, but option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, perhaps the question expects me to use a different approach or perhaps I missed a factor somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should be done using the natural unit conversion for decay length.

Wait, another approach: The decay length L is given by (c * tau) * (gamma * beta).

So, c*tau is the product of speed of light and proper lifetime.

But wait, the proper lifetime is tau, and in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma*tau.

So, the distance is v * gamma tau = beta c gamma tau.

Which is what I've been using.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the mean decay length as L = (c * tau) * (gamma * beta).

Which is what I've done.

Wait, perhaps the answer expects using the value of beta as 0.988686 and gamma as 6.666666667, leading to beta*gamma=6.59123.

Then, L=6.59123 *6.170625e-16=40.67205e-16=4.067205e-15 m.

Which is 4.0672e-15 m.

But the option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is close but not exactly the same.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for beta and gamma.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation for beta and gamma.

Let me compute gamma=8/(1.2)=6.666666666666667.

Beta= sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)} )= sqrt(0.9775)=0.988686383.

So, beta=0.988686383.

Then, beta * gamma=6.666666666666667 *0.988686383=?

Compute 6 *0.988686383=5.932118298.

0.666666666666667 *0.988686383=0.659124255.

Total=5.932118298 +0.659124255=6.591242553.

So, beta*gamma=6.591242553.

Now, c*tau=3e8 *2.056875e-24=6.170625e-16 m.

So, L=6.591242553 *6.170625e-16=40.67207e-16 m=4.067207e-15 m.

Again, same as before.

Hmm, perhaps the answer expects using the width in MeV, but I used 0.32 GeV.

Wait, no, the width is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should use the value of Planck's constant in a different way.

Alternative approach: Decay length L is given by L = (c * ħ) / (Gamma) ) * (E/(m)) * (sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2} )).

Wait, perhaps that's another way to write it.

But I think I've covered all possible approaches.

Given that, the calculation leads me to approximately 4.067e-15 m, but the closest option is B:4.0655e-15 m.

So why is there a discrepancy? Maybe it's due to using ħ as 6.582e-25 GeV·s instead of a more precise value.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact question uses different constants.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise ħ.

The exact value of ħ is approximately 6.58233 ×10^-25 GeV·s.

Using that, tau=6.58233e-25 /0.32=20.56978125e-25=2.056978125e-24 s.

c*tau=3e8 *2.056978125e-24 =6.170934375e-16 m.

Then, beta*gamma=6.591242553.

So, L=6.591242553 *6.170934375e-16 =40.67409e-16=4.067409e-15 m.

Which is about 4.0674e-15 m.

But the option is 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects using beta=0.98875 and gamma=6.666667, leading to L=4.0674e-15, but this isn't an option. The closest is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should have used E = m + something else, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units when calculating tau.

Wait, tau= ħ / Gamma.

Wait, Gamma is given in MeV, and ħ is in GeV·s.

So, Gamma=320 MeV=0.32 GeV.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the decay length using the formula L = (c * tau) * (gamma * beta) → but perhaps the calculation should use more precise values for beta and gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: The decay length L is given by L = (c * tau) * (gamma * beta).

But perhaps, in some sources, the formula is L = (c * tau) * (gamma * beta) * c.

Wait, no, because beta is in terms of c.

Wait, no, L = v * t → v = beta c, t= gamma tau.

So, L= beta c gamma tau.

Which is what I used.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mass is given as 1.2 GeV, but in reality, it's 1.2 GeV/c², so when calculating E = gamma m c², the units could affect.

But earlier, I think I accounted for that by ensuring that when c=1, E is in GeV, m in GeV/c², so E = gamma m c² → gamma = E/(m c²) → which with c=1, is E/(m).

So, it's okay.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic relation for decay length.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Given that, I think the correct answer is approximately 4.067e-15 m, which isn't exactly any of the options, but the closest is option B:4.0655e-15 m.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.

Wait, another check: compute 7.91/8=0.98875.

But using the other method, beta= sqrt(0.9775)=0.988686.

So, a small discrepancy, but which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps the correct beta is 0.98875 because it's derived from the exact momentum and energy relation.

So, in that case, the calculated L is approximately 4.067e-15 m.

But none of the options match this exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects using beta=0.98875, leading to the calculated L around 4.067e-15 m, but the closest option is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should have used 1.2 GeV as the mass, leading to gamma=8/(1.2)=6.6666667, beta= sqrt(1 - (1.44/64)} )= sqrt(0.9775)=0.988686.

So, beta*gamma=6.6666667 *0.988686=6.59124.

c*tau=6.170625e-16 m.

So, L=6.59124 *6.170625e-16=4.067207e-15 m.

But, again, the closest option is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:5.0223e-15 m, but that's much higher.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Wait, gamma is E/(m c²) → E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV/c².

So, gamma=8/(1.2) =6.666666667.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another approach—maybe the problem is using the relativistic formula for the mean path length, which is L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation involves the particle's velocity and lifetime.

But I think I've covered all the possibilities. Given that, I think option B is the correct choice, despite the slight discrepancy in the calculation.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \) is the velocity of the particle in units of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Compute the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The width \( \Gamma \) is given as \( 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Using the reduced Planck constant \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), the proper lifetime is:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \)
The energy \( E \) and mass \( m \) are given as \( 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), respectively. The Lorentz factor is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
\]

The velocity factor \( \beta \) is calculated using the relation:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.2^2}{8^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.44}{64}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.988686.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the decay length \( L \)
The decay length is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau.
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( \beta \gamma = 0.988686 \times 6.6667 \approx 6.59124 \),
- \( c \tau = (3 \times 10^8) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m} \),

we find:

\[
L = 6.59124 \times 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m} \approx 4.0672 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated value \( L \approx 4.0672 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is very close to option **B** (\( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)). The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding differences in intermediate steps.

### Final Answer:
**B**
