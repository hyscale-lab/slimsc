Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the transgenic mouse model isn't overexpressing the GADD45G protein as expected. Let's go step by step.

The setup is that the person wants to study GADD45G's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They created a transgenic mouse with inducible overexpression of GADD45G. They modified the gene to include an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with this plasmid using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But despite all that, the protein isn't overexpressing.

Looking at the given DNA sequence, it's the plus strand, starting with ATG, which is the start codon. The sequence continues with various codons. Now, I need to analyze this to find the issue.

First, I'll check for any premature stop codons because that would cause the ribosome to terminate early. Stop codons are UAA, UAG, or UGA. Looking through the sequence, I'll translate it to see if there's a stop codon before the expected end.

Wait, let me parse the DNA sequence. Let's look for any 'TGA' in the coding sequence because that's a stop codon when transcribed. Scanning through:

The sequence starts with ATG, then TAC (tyrosine), CC... etc. Let me find any TGA. Hmm, looking through:

...ATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, towards the end, I see 'TGA' at the very end: ...AGTGA. Let me check the last part:

...GACCTCAGTGA3'

So the last few codons are ...GAC (Asp), CT (wait, codons are three letters). So the last part is:

- ...CAG (Gln), CTT (Leu), TGA (stop). Oh, wait, the TGA is a stop codon. So the DNA sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. Wait, but the last part shows "TTT...GAGTGA3'". Wait, the full sequence is:

...GACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Wait, let's check the last part: The part in question is "GAGTGA". So the last codons are GAG (Glu) and TGA (stop). So in the DNA, the last codon is TGA, which when transcribed would be UGA in mRNA, a stop codon.

Wait, but the construct includes a HA tag at the N-terminal. HA is a peptide from influenza, so the HA tag should be at the beginning. Let me see where the HA tag is. HA is from the influenza hemagglutinin. The HA tag is usually added as a peptide, so the DNA would encode something like MA or similar. But the question says that the HA sequence is introduced at the N-terminus, so the start of the coding sequence should be the HA coding, then GADD45G.

Wait, the first part of the DNA is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G.. So the first codon is ATG (start), next TAC is Tyr, then CCA is Pro, TAC is Tyr, GAT is Asp, etc. But if the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus before the GADD45G, then perhaps the HA sequence is not correct.

But wait, wait. The HA tag is supposed to be added at the N-terminus. So the construct should be: HA coding sequence followed by GADD45G. How is that done? The HA tag is a short peptide, maybe like YPYDVPDYA, but in terms of DNA, it's a specific sequence. So perhaps the person inserted the HA sequence before the GADD45G coding. But in the given sequence, the first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G.. which starts with ATG (start) followed by TAC (Tyr). But HA has a start as well, so perhaps the HA doesn't have its own start codon but is in frame with the GADD45G.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag was introduced without a proper start codon, but the given sequence starts with ATG, which is correct. So perhaps the HA is part of the start.

Wait, perhaps the HA is being inserted incorrectly, causing a frameshift or a premature stop.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA is in the correct frame, but the way it's added causes the GADD45G to start correctly.

But looking at the DNA sequence, the presence of a TGA at the end that's in the coding frame would cause a premature stop. Let me see: the entire sequence starts with ATG (start), so the frame is 0. Let's count the number of nucleotides to see if the TGA is at the end or somewhere in the middle.

Wait, the entire sequence is 1794 nucleotides long (counting each character: 3' ... but let me count from 5' to 3' in the given line).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for the presence of a stop codon within the coding sequence. If the TGA is present in the middle, that would cause the ribosome to stop early, leading to no full-length protein.

Looking at the sequence again, perhaps the TGA is in the middle? Let me search for TGA within the sequence.

Wait, the sequence is:

5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Looking for TGA in the sequence. Let's check each triplet:

...TGAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGAC...

Wait, looking for TGA. The substring "TGA" appears near the end:

...CTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Looking at the last part: ...CGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Breaking this down into codons:

...CGT TAA CGA CTG GGT GCC CAG CAT CAC CCT CCG AGT GA.

Wait, the last few codons are CGA (R), CTG (L), GGT (G), GCC (A), CAG (Q), CAT (H), CAC (H), CCT (P), CGA (R), GAG (E), TGA (stop). Wait, no, the last part is GAGTGA.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me write the last part:

...CGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Looking for TGA. Let's see:

Positions:

Positions 1785-1793: CGAGTGA3'

So the last part is CGAGTGA. That's CGA G TGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop.

Wait, so in the DNA, the last codon is TGA, which in mRNA would be UGA, a stop codon. So that means the gene construct ends with a stop codon. But in the intended construct, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, and GADD45G should be expressed as a fusion with HA. So the presence of an early stop codon would cause the protein to be truncated, leading to no overexpression.

Wait, but in the given sequence, the TGA is at the very end of the coding region. So maybe the construct is designed to have the HA tag followed by GADD45G, and the stop codon comes after. But in this case, the TGA is part of the GADD45G sequence, causing a premature stop.

Wait, but GADD45G is a known gene, so its coding sequence shouldn't end with a TGA. So perhaps the introduced HA tag insertion caused a frameshift, leading to a premature stop codon.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag wasn't correctly inserted in frame, leading to a frameshift mutation. Or perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence has a stop codon, but I don't think that's the case here.

But wait, the main issue the user is facing is that the protein isn't being expressed. So why? The possible options are:

Option A: HA has a missense mutation. That could affect the protein's function but not necessarily stop its expression unless it's a premature stop.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would require a stop codon upstream.

Option C: Lack of linker causing proteolysis. That would affect the protein after expression, maybe leading to degradation but not absence of expression.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. Wait, UAA is a stop codon. If the mouse doesn't have a tRNA for UAA, but wait, stop codons are not translated into amino acids. They're just signals, so the absence of a tRNA for UAA shouldn't matter because it's not used to add an amino acid.

So the main issue is whether the construct has a premature stop codon.

Looking back, the sequence ends with GAGTGA, which is GAG (Glu) and TGA (stop). So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the protein would be translated until this point, but that's the end. So if the intended construct was longer, perhaps the HA tag is correctly placed, but the stop codon is in the middle. Wait, but in this case, the stop is at the end, so maybe the construct is correct, but perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence has a stop earlier.

Wait, wait, perhaps the HA tag is in the first part. Let me think: HA is from the influenza virus, and its coding sequence is often added as a tag. So the HA sequence would be a short peptide, say, 10 amino acids, so about 30 nucleotides. Let me count the first part of the DNA:

The first 30 nucleotides after ATG are:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTC CGC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC A...

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's coding is part of this. But if the HA is correctly added, it should be in frame. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag wasn't correctly inserted, causing a frameshift. Let me check for any in-frame stop codons.

Wait, the first codons are:

ATG (start), TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), CCA (Pro), GAT (Asp), TAC (Tyr), GCC (Ala), CAA (Gln), ATG (start again? Hmm, that's a problem because this would cause a new start codon in the middle.

Wait, the sequence is:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTC CGC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC A...

Wait, after the initial ATG, the next codons are TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, etc. But then at position 24 (counting from the start), the sequence is CAA ATG ACT. That's CAA (Gln), then ATG (start), ACT (Thr). Oh, wait! There's another start codon (ATG) in the middle. So the ribosome would start translating from the first ATG, then when it encounters the second ATG, it might start a new frame, but more importantly, perhaps the presence of an internal ATG is causing issues.

Wait, but the initial ATG is the start. The second ATG is in the same reading frame? Let me see:

The first codon is ATG (1-3), then TAC (4-6), CCA (7-9), TAC (10-12), GAT (13-15), GTT (16-18), CCA (19-21), GAT (22-24), TAC (25-27), GCC (28-30), CAA (31-33), ATG (34-36), ACT (37-39), etc.

So the second ATG is at 34-36. So in the same frame. So the ribosome would translate until it hits a stop codon. But if the second ATG is in the same frame, the initial ATG starts the protein, and the second ATG would be the 12th amino acid (since each codon is 3 nucleotides; 33 nucleotides into the sequence is 11 codons, so 11 amino acids). Then the next codon is ACT (Thr), then CTG (Leu), etc.

Wait, but in this case, the presence of a second ATG might cause a frameshift? Or does it just create an internal methionine? I'm not sure. But perhaps the main issue is that the stop codon is at the end, causing the construct to terminate early.

Wait, no. The stop codon is the last codon, as I saw earlier. So the protein would be translated from the start codon until the TGA, which is at the end. So why isn't the protein being expressed? Because the construct is correct, but perhaps the HA tag is disrupting the reading frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag wasn't correctly inserted, leading to a frameshift. Let me think: the HA tag should be added in frame, but if it's not, the entire coding sequence would be shifted, leading to a stop codon early on.

Wait, let me think about the options again. Option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would happen if there's a stop codon upstream. In this case, the stop codon is at the end, so the entire protein would be expressed but perhaps truncated.

Wait, but the given DNA is the coding sequence, and the TGA is at the end. So the construct is correct, and the protein should be expressed until the end. Unless the HA tag introduces a stop codon earlier.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look again at the possible options. The question is why the protein isn't overexpressing. The options are:

A) HA has a missense mutation.

B) Ribosome stopped early.

C) No linker causing proteolysis.

D) No tRNA for UAA.

Option D is about a non-existent tRNA for UAA. But UAA is a stop codon, and stop codons don't require tRNAs because translation stops. So D is unlikely.

Option C is about proteolysis. If the protein is expressed but rapidly degraded, you wouldn't detect it. But the question says the overexpression isn't happening, so maybe the protein isn't even made.

Option B: If the ribosome stops early, there would be a truncated protein. But if the stop codon is at the end, the full-length protein would be made. So maybe the problem is that the start codon is not being recognized.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the construct doesn't have a RBS (ribosome binding site) before the start codon, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the construct includes a stop codon before the intended end.

Wait, in the given DNA sequence, the last codon is TGA. So the protein should be correctly expressed until that point. So why isn't it overexpressing?

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate early. Let me think about the HA sequence. If the HA coding sequence introduces a stop codon, perhaps the GADD45G isn't expressed because the ribosome stops at the HA tag.

Wait, but the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the GADD45G should be expressed after it. Unless the HA tag's coding sequence includes a stop codon.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag insertion caused a frameshift, leading to a premature stop codon earlier in the sequence.

Wait, looking at the sequence again, the initial part after ATG is TAC CCA TAC GAT G..., which is Tyr Pro Tyr Asp etc. If the HA tag is supposed to be in the correct frame, but the insertion caused a frameshift, perhaps introducing a stop codon.

Let me count the nucleotides in the HA tag. Suppose the HA tag is 10 amino acids, which would be 30 nucleotides. The first 30 nucleotides are:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC CAA ATG ACT CTG

That's 30 nucleotides (10 codons). The 10th codon is CTG (Leu), which is the 30th nucleotide. Wait, the first 30 would be:

ATG (1-3), TAC (4-6), CCA (7-9), TAC (10-12), GAT (13-15), GTT (16-18), CCA (19-21), GAT (22-24), TAC (25-27), GCC (28-30). So the 10th codon is GCC (Ala). Wait, but in the given sequence, the 31-33 is CAA, which is the 11th codon. So perhaps the HA tag is only 10 codons (30 bases), so the next codon should be the start of GADD45G.

But wait, in the given sequence, after the initial 30 nucleotides, the next codon is CAA (31-33), then ATG (34-36) which is another start codon. So that's a problem because it introduces another ATG in frame. So the ribosome starts at the first ATG, and then at codon 11 (position 34-36), another ATG is present. This would create a second start codon, but the main issue is that the construct may have an internal stop codon.

Wait, but looking further, the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the construct is designed to have the HA tag followed by GADD45G, but the presence of an internal stop codon (TGA) at the end suggests that the entire ORF is correctly designed. But why isn't the protein expressed?

Wait, perhaps the cloned sequence is in the wrong orientation. Let me check the sequence. It starts with ATG, which is a start codon, and ends with TGA, a stop. So the plasmid probably has a promoter, then the ATG start, then the coding sequence, then the stop.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag's sequence includes a stop codon. Let me see: the HA tag is a short peptide, so its DNA sequence would not include a stop codon because that would terminate the protein prematurely. So if the HA tag's DNA includes a TGA within it, that would cause a stop early.

Looking at the first part of the sequence:

The first 30 nucleotides after ATG are:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC CAA ATG ACT CTG.

Wait, in this part, the 11th codon (34-36) is ATG, which is another start codon. So the ribosome would start at the first ATG, then when it reaches the second ATG, it would start a new frame. But that's not possible because the ribosome doesn't typically re-initiate unless there's a uORF or something, which isn't the case here.

Wait, but the presence of another ATG in the same reading frame would just add a methionine at that position, not cause a stop. So perhaps that's not the issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag isn't correctly ligated, leading to a frameshift. For example, if the HA tag was inserted in a way that shifts the reading frame, introducing a premature stop codon.

But looking at the sequence, the HA tag's part seems to be in frame because the second ATG is in the same frame as the first. So that suggests that the HA is correctly inserted.

Wait, another thought: the plasmid might have the HA tag followed by GADD45G, but the HA tag's DNA might have a stop codon in it. Let me check the first 30 nucleotides again for any TGA.

Looking for TGA in the first 30:

Positions:

1-3: ATG

4-6: TAC

7-9: CCA

10-12: TAC

13-15: GAT

16-18: GCT (Wait, the sequence says Gtt CCA. Wait, Gtt is G-T-T, which is GTT (Val). Then CCA (Pro), GAT (Asp), TAC (Tyr), GCC (Ala), CAA (Gln), ATG (Met), ACT (Thr), CTG (Leu).

So the first 30 nucleotides are:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT Gtt CCA GAT TAC GCC CAA ATG ACT CTG.

Wait, looking for TGA in this segment. No TGA here.

Wait, the problem must be elsewhere. Let me think about the possible options again.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. Which would require a stop codon upstream.

But in the given sequence, the stop codon is at the end. So the ribosome would translate all the way to the end, producing a full-length protein.

Unless there's a stop codon earlier. Let me check the entire sequence for any TGA.

Looking through the sequence:

Looking for TGA:

...ACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Hmm, found 'TGA' right after 'TCT' and 'GAA' somewhere. Wait, looking for 'TGA' in the middle:

Looking at the sequence, I see 'TGA' occurs in the middle: "TGAACGTGGAC...". Let me see:

From the middle:

...GCTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, within this, I see 'TGAACGTGGAC', so the substring is TGAACG... So the 'TGA' is at positions 100-102 (approximately). So that's a TGA in the middle, which is a stop codon. Oh! So the construct has an internal TGA, which is a stop codon, causing the ribosome to terminate early. That would result in a truncated protein, which might not function properly and could be difficult to detect with an antibody specific for the HA tag if the HA is at the N-terminus and the truncation occurs before it.

Wait, but the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the stop codon is in the middle of the GADD45G coding sequence. So the ribosome would stop before the end, leading to a truncated protein that doesn't include the HA tag correctly, or perhaps no expression at all if the stop is in a critical region.

So the presence of this internal TGA is the issue. Therefore, the problem is that the construct has a premature stop codon, leading to early termination.

Looking back at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would be caused by the presence of a stop codon upstream, which is exactly what's happening here.

So the correct answer should be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining why the GADD45G protein is not being overexpressed in a transgenic mouse model. The construct includes a HA tag at the N-terminus and the GADD45G coding sequence. The provided DNA sequence starts with the start codon (ATG) and ends with a stop codon (TGA). Upon analyzing the sequence, an internal stop codon (TGA) was identified in the middle of the coding region. This stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, leading to the production of a truncated protein or no protein at all, depending on the location of the stop codon relative to the HA tag.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: A missense mutation in the HA tag sequence would affect the protein's function but would not necessarily prevent its expression. This is unlikely to be the cause of the lack of overexpression.
- **Option B**: The presence of a premature stop codon (TGA) in the middle of the coding sequence would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the full-length protein from being expressed. This matches the observed issue.
- **Option C**: Lack of a linker sequence could lead to proteolysis of the nascent chain, but this would not explain the complete absence of overexpression. Proteolysis typically occurs post-translationally, not at the level of transcription or translation termination.
- **Option D**: Stop codons (e.g., UAA, UAG, UGA) do not require tRNA for termination because translation stops upon encountering these codons. The absence of a tRNA for UAA is irrelevant in this context.

The key issue is the premature stop codon (TGA) in the middle of the coding sequence, which causes the ribosome to terminate translation early. This explains the lack of overexpression of the GADD45G protein.

**Answer: B**
