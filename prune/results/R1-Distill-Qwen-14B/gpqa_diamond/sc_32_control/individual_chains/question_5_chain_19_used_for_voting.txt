Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator P seems to have components Px, Py, and Pz, each given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, wait. So I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables like position, momentum, spin are represented by operators. And the eigenstates of these operators correspond to the possible states the system can be in when measured.

The operator P here must be a vector operator since it's given in terms of components along x, y, and z. So the operator P is a vector, and each component is a matrix. The eigenvector we're looking for is an eigenstate of the operator along direction n with eigenvalue +ħ/2. 

Wait, but how do I find the eigenvector of an operator along an arbitrary direction? I think I remember that when dealing with spin, for example, the spin operator along a direction n is given by the dot product of the vector operator (like the Pauli matrices) and the direction vector. So maybe I should find the operator P along n and then find its eigenvector.

So the direction n is in the x-z plane. That means the direction vector can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) because it's in the x-z plane, so the y-component is zero. Or wait, sometimes angles are defined differently. Wait, no, usually θ is the polar angle, measured from the z-axis. So for a direction in the x-z plane, the azimuth φ is 0 or π, but in this case, since it's arbitrary, maybe φ is zero? Or actually, the direction can be represented as (cosθ, 0, sinθ) if θ is measured from the x-axis? Hmm, maybe I should think about that.

Wait, but the problem says that the direction n is in the x-z plane, so φ can be zero without loss of generality because the problem is arbitrary. So perhaps we can represent n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Or (cosθ, 0, sinθ) if it's from the x-axis? Wait, no, polar coordinates have θ from the z-axis. So in x-z plane, the angle φ is 0 or π, but since the direction is arbitrary, perhaps the eigenvector would have components depending on θ and φ, but in this case, φ is zero. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the operator P is given as a vector operator, with components Px, Py, Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, for example, Px is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], the Pauli Y matrix, and Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

So the operator P is a vector operator, and the eigenvalue equation is P · n |ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the operator along direction n is P·n, which would be n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz.

But n is in the x-z plane, so n_y = 0. So P·n becomes n_x Px + n_z Pz. Let's model n as a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1.

Let me write out P·n. Substituting Px, Py, Pz, we get:

P·n = (n_x (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]) + (n_z (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]) )

Which simplifies to:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Because n_x and n_z are real numbers since n is a real unit vector.

Wait, let me double-check that. The first term from Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix with 0 and 1 in the first row. The second term from Pz is (ħ/2) times the diagonal matrix. So adding them together, the (1,1) element is n_z * (ħ/2), the (1,2) element is n_x * (ħ/2), and the (2,2) element is -n_z * (ħ/2). The (2,1) element is also n_x * (ħ/2).

So the matrix P·n is (ħ/2) multiplied by:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

But wait, the actual matrix for P·n would be (ħ/2) * [n_z, n_x; n_x, -n_z]. So that's the operator we need to find the eigenvectors of.

Since n is in the x-z plane, n has components (n_x, 0, n_z), where n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So, the eigenvalue equation for P·n is:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ] * |ψ> = (λ) |ψ>

But wait, the operator is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix, so when we write the eigenvalue equation, it's actually (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) * λ |ψ>, so the eigenvalue equation becomes:

( (ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] ) |ψ> = (ħ/2) * λ |ψ>

Which simplifies to:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |ψ> = λ |ψ>

So we can ignore the (ħ/2) factor for now since we're looking for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix, and then the eigenvalue λ would correspond to the eigenvalue of the operator divided by (ħ/2). But in the problem, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So when we solve, the eigenvalue for the matrix part must be +1.

Wait, because the operator's eigenvalue is (ħ/2)*λ, so if that's equal to +ħ/2, then λ must be +1.

So the matrix equation is [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] * |ψ> = (1) |ψ>.

So let's write the matrix:

A = [ [n_z, n_x],
       [n_x, -n_z] ]

We need to find the eigenvectors of A with eigenvalue 1.

The characteristic equation is det(A - I) = 0.

So A - I is:

[ n_z - 1,    n_x      ]
[ n_x,      -n_z - 1 ]

The determinant is (n_z - 1)(-n_z - 1) - (n_x)^2 = 0.

Expanding this:

(n_z -1)(-n_z -1) = (-n_z^2 -n_z + n_z +1 ) = (-n_z^2 +1 )

So determinant is (-n_z^2 +1 ) - n_x^2 = 0.

But since n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, because n is a unit vector, let's substitute n_x^2 = 1 - n_z^2.

So determinant equation becomes:

(-n_z^2 +1 ) - (1 - n_z^2) = 0 → (-n_z^2 +1 -1 +n_z^2 )=0 → 0 =0.

Wait, that can't be right. That suggests that all the eigenvalues are 1 or -1? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate the determinant.

det(A - I) = (a -1)(d -1) - bc, where A is [[a, b], [c, d]]

So a = n_z, d = -n_z. So (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) - (n_x)^2.

Expanding (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) = -n_z^2 -n_z + n_z +1 = -n_z^2 +1 + ( -n_z +n_z ) which is 0. So yeah, (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) = -n_z^2 +1.

Then subtracting (n_x)^2: determinant is (-n_z^2 +1) - n_x^2.

But n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1 → n_x^2 =1 -n_z^2.

So substituting: (-n_z^2 +1) - (1 -n_z^2 ) = (-n_z^2 +1 -1 +n_z^2 ) =0.

So the determinant is zero, meaning any λ that satisfies the equation is a solution, but since the trace is zero (Trace of A is n_z -n_z =0), the eigenvalues are 1 and -1.

So the eigenvalues are 1 and -1.

We are looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +1.

So the eigenvalue equation for A is (A - I) |ψ> = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

( n_z -1 ) ψ1 + n_x ψ2 = 0

n_x ψ1 + ( -n_z -1 ) ψ2 = 0

From the first equation: (n_z -1 ) ψ1 + n_x ψ2 = 0 → (n_z -1 ) ψ1 = -n_x ψ2.

Let me solve for ψ2 in terms of ψ1.

ψ2 = [ (1 - n_z ) / n_x ] ψ1.

Wait, but n_x can be zero. Hmm, but n is in the x-z plane, so if n_x is zero, n would be along the z-axis. But in general, n_x isn't zero, so let's proceed.

So the eigenvector can be written as ψ = [ ψ1, ψ2 ]^T = [1, (1 - n_z ) / n_x ]^T multiplied by a normalization factor.

Wait, but wait, the matrix equation has ψ1 and ψ2. Let me represent the vector as [1, (1-n_z)/n_x ].

But we need to normalize this vector.

The normalization factor is 1/sqrt( |1|^2 + |(1-n_z)/n_x|^2 ).

Wait, but n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1 → n_x^2=1 -n_z^2 → n_x = sqrt(1 -n_z^2), assuming n_x is positive. But perhaps for generality, we can just write it as n_x = sqrt(1 -n_z^2). But maybe it's better to express everything in terms of angles.

Wait, n is in the x-z plane, so it can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), assuming θ is the angle from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So substituting n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, the expression becomes (1 - cosθ)/sinθ.

Which is [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ].

Hmm, I remember that (1 - cosθ)/sinθ is equal to tan(θ/2).

So ψ2 = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] ψ1 = tan(θ/2) ψ1.

So the eigenvector components are ψ1 and ψ2 = tan(θ/2) ψ1.

So let's write the vector as [1, tan(θ/2)].

Wait, but we need to normalize this vector.

The normalization condition is |1|^2 + |tan(θ/2)|^2 = 1.

Wait, let me compute 1 + tan²(θ/2) = 1 + (sin²(θ/2)/cos²(θ/2)) ) = 1/(cos²(θ/2)).

So 1 + tan²(θ/2) = 1 / cos²(θ/2) → sqrt(1 + tan²(θ/2)) ) = 1/|cos(θ/2)|.

So the normalized vector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, because [1, tan(θ/2) ] divided by 1/cos(θ/2) gives [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, let me see. If I write the vector as [1, tan(θ/2)], then the norm is sqrt(1 + tan²(θ/2)) ) = sec(θ/2). So the normalized vector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

But wait, that's for θ between 0 and π, I suppose. Because for θ = 0, we get [1, 0], and for θ= π, [0, 1].

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors can have a phase factor, so the state is determined up to a global phase. So this seems correct.

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which matches what I've derived.

Option B is (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ). That looks like the spherical harmonics, but for spin-1/2, the eigenvectors are more like the ones in option C.

Option D is something with sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), which seems related to specific components but I'm not sure.

Option A has hbar in the components, which doesn't make sense because the eigenvectors are dimensionless, right? Or wait, no, because the operator has units of ħ/2. So the eigenvectors are vectors in a Hilbert space, which is normalized, so they don't carry units. So A's options have units of ħ, which would be incorrect.

So the correct answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The direction $\vec{n}$ is in the x-z plane, so it can be represented as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$
The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]
Substituting the given components:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
and $n_x = \sin\theta$, $n_z = \cos\theta$, we get:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \right) |\psi\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |\psi\rangle
\]
Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, we focus on the matrix:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]
The eigenvalues of this matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation:
\[
\det\left( \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - \lambda & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - \lambda \end{bmatrix} \right) = 0
\]
Expanding the determinant:
\[
(\cos\theta - \lambda)(-\cos\theta - \lambda) - \sin^2\theta = 0
\]
Simplifying:
\[
-\cos^2\theta - \lambda^2 + \lambda\cos\theta + \lambda\cos\theta - \sin^2\theta = 0
\]
Using $\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta = 1$, this reduces to:
\[
-\lambda^2 + 2\lambda\cos\theta - 1 = 0
\]
Solving for $\lambda$, the eigenvalues are:
\[
\lambda = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \lambda = -1
\]
We are interested in the eigenvalue $\lambda = 1$.

### Step 3: Find the eigenvector for $\lambda = 1$
For $\lambda = 1$, the eigenvalue equation becomes:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \psi_1 \\ \psi_2 \end{bmatrix} = 0
\]
From the first row:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)\psi_1 + \sin\theta \psi_2 = 0
\]
Solving for $\psi_2$ in terms of $\psi_1$:
\[
\psi_2 = \frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} \psi_1
\]
Using the trigonometric identity $\frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} = \tan(\theta/2)$, we have:
\[
\psi_2 = \tan(\theta/2) \psi_1
\]
The eigenvector is therefore:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \psi_1 \\ \tan(\theta/2) \psi_1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
To normalize, we impose:
\[
|\psi_1|^2 + |\psi_2|^2 = 1
\]
Substituting $\psi_2 = \tan(\theta/2) \psi_1$:
\[
|\psi_1|^2 + |\tan(\theta/2) \psi_1|^2 = 1
\]
\[
|\psi_1|^2 \left( 1 + \tan^2(\theta/2) \right) = 1
\]
Using $1 + \tan^2(\theta/2) = \sec^2(\theta/2)$, we find:
\[
|\psi_1| = \cos(\theta/2), \quad |\psi_2| = \sin(\theta/2)
\]
Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect for a normalized eigenvector.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ corresponds to spherical harmonics, not the spin-1/2 eigenvectors.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ introduces incorrect normalization factors and includes $\hbar$.

The correct answer is **Option C**.
