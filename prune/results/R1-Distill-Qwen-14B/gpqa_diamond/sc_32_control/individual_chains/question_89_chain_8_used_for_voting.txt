Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably forming an alkene. But wait, adamantane is a pretty rigid structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two bromides and form an alkene between the 1 and 3 positions? Or wait, maybe between adjacent carbons. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together in a particular way. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on carbons that are two apart, perhaps. When KOH is used, it's likely an E2 elimination, leading to the formation of a double bond. Since there are two bromines, elimination would form a double bond between the two adjacent carbons. But wait, 1 and 3 are not adjacent. Oh, wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbering. Alternatively, the structure might have the bromines on adjacent bridgehead carbons, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diene or a mono-alkene. Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. I think elimination would give an alkene, which is a colorless solid, but maybe in this case, it's a more complex structure. But the NMR data can help.

The first product's H NMR is given: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). There's also an IR peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an ester. Wait, but if KOH is used in elimination, that would form an alkene, not a carbonyl. Hmm, so maybe the initial reaction is not elimination but something else.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but wait, KOH in such conditions can also cause elimination (like E2 mechanism) which forms alkenes. But then why the IR suggests a carbonyl?

Alternatively, wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But for that, KOH would need a leaving group. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a dihalide, so maybe substitution occurs but with two bromides? That seems less likely because substitution typically occurs one at a time, and with KOH, more likely elimination.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane? But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps when KOH is used in excess, it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by another elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, considering the IR peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe the product is a ketone or an ester. How can KOH lead to a carbonyl? Oh, wait, maybe it's a Fittig reaction, but that's when two aryl halides are coupled. But adamantane isn't aromatic, so that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction is a dielimination, forming a carbonyl. Wait, if you eliminate two HBr molecules, perhaps forming a ketone. So, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr, it would form an alkene, but wait, that's elimination of two HBr from adjacent carbons, but that would give a double bond. Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that elimination forms a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that each Br is on adjacent carbons, making it a vicinal dihalide. Wait, but the numbering is 1 and 3, which are two apart. Oh, maybe in the adamantane structure, the 1 and 3 positions are adjacent? I'm not exactly sure about the structure, but perhaps in this case, the elimination leads to a bridgehead double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but then why the IR shows a carbonyl? Hmm, perhaps the product isn't just an alkene but has other functional groups.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the KOH is acting as a base for elimination, but the product isn't just an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination or something else, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. How? If each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group. Wait, but that would require two substitutions, which might not happen under KOH. Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a ketone via some elimination mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. But then the IR wouldn't show 1720 cm^-1, as epoxides have different carbonyl regions.

Wait, perhaps it's a ketone. The only way I can think of is if two adjacent Br atoms are removed as HBr, and a double bond is formed. But that wouldn't directly form a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening reaction, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's look at the NMR data for product 1. So, the NMR shows:

- 4.79 ppm (2H) as a singlet? Or maybe a triplet or something else? Wait, the question doesn't specify the splitting, just the integration and chemical shift. So 2H at ~4.8 ppm. That region is typical for CH2 groups attached to oxygen, like in ethers or ketals, or perhaps adjacent to an oxygen, like in a carbonyl group. Or maybe it's an AB system with coupling.

Wait, 4.79 is a bit upfield for an aromatic CH2, but more likely for something like an -OCH2- group, but why would that be in this compound?

The 2.41-2.23 region integrates to 10H. That's a lot of protons, maybe from a cyclohexane ring or multiple CH2 groups. Adamantane has a lot of CH2 groups, so maybe this is the bridgehead structure.

The 1.94 ppm (2H) seems like another CH2 group, perhaps adjacent to an electronegative group or in a different environment.

The IR at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong indication of a carbonyl. So maybe the product is a ketone. So, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation where two adjacent bromides are removed, but that leads to a double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-elimination to form a ketone.

Wait, another approach: let's imagine that 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon treatment with KOH, undergoes dehydrohalogenation twice, losing two HBr molecules. If the structure is such that elimination can form a ketone, perhaps.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that when the two Br atoms are removed, a carbonyl group is formed. For example, if the two adjacent carbons each lose a Br and a hydrogen, creating a double bond. But that would form an alkene, not a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a carbonyl group. Wait, maybe it's a pinacol-like elimination. Pinacol is 1,2-diol, but when treated with acid, it loses water to form a carbonyl. But in this case, we have dihalide and KOH. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is treated with a strong base, which abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbonyl through a two-step elimination. Wait, but I'm not sure about that mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the starting material isn't a dihalide but a geminal dihalide—like two bromines on the same carbon. In that case, elimination could form a carbonyl. Oh wait, that's possible. For example, if you have a geminal dihalide, like 1,1-dibromoadamantane, then treatment with a base would lead to elimination of two HBr molecules and formation of a carbonyl group. But the question states 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so that's a vicinal dihalide, not geminal.

So that approach might not work. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product isn't a ketone but an epoxide, but I don't think so because the IR for an epoxide is around 1200-1300 cm^-1 for the C-O-C stretching, and the carbonyl would be elsewhere. But the IR here is at 1720, which is more like a ketone.

Wait, maybe the product is a diol? No, because KOH is a base and more likely to cause elimination than substitution. Also, diols would have OH groups, which would show broad peaks in NMR, but the product here is a light yellow solid, and the NMR data don't show any broad singlets, except perhaps the 1.94 ppm, which is maybe a CH2 group.

Hmm, maybe the product is a cyclopropane? But a cyclopropane wouldn't have a carbonyl, so that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution, but with KOH, it's more likely elimination. So maybe the product is an alkene, but then why is there a carbonyl in the IR?

Wait, what about ozonolysis later on? Oh wait, the second step is heating with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Hmm, aluminum isopropoxide is used as a Lewis acid catalyst, perhaps for some kind of ring-opening or for inducing elimination. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, let me try to think about each step again.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid). NMR and IR suggest carbonyl and some CH2 groups.

Step 2: product 1 heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide → product 2.

Step 3: product 2 treated with ozone at -78°C, then dimethylsulfide → product 3. Then, what's the NMR of product 3, focusing on the most deshielded H.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H in product 3.

So perhaps I should figure out what each product is.

First, product 1.

If product 1 is a diene, then ozonolysis would break the double bonds into carbonyl groups. But let's see.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone. Let's imagine 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules to form a carbonyl group. How? If the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, and upon elimination, perhaps a bridgehead carbonyl forms.

Wait, another approach: think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be an -OCH2- group. Wait, but where would that come from? If product 1 is an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ether. Or perhaps an ester. But the IR at 1720 could be an ester's carbonyl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone. Let me re-examine the structure.

Assuming that 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr in an E2 elimination, forming a double bond. But if that's the case, then product 1 would be an alkene. But the IR would show a peak around 1650 cm^-1 for the C=C. However, the IR here is at 1720, which is more in line with a carbonyl.

So maybe the initial product is not an alkene but a ketone. How?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a two-step elimination. For example, each Br is eliminated, but in a way that forms a carbonyl. Wait, but I'm not familiar with that mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's usually for ketones to form esters or lactones, which doesn't fit here.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the product is a bicyclic structure with a carbonyl group. For example, if the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and elimination forms a bridge with a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane with a ketone group attached. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, and the NMR data supports that.

If product 1 is a ketone, then the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl. So, perhaps something like (CH2)CO.

But the 2.41-2.23 (10H) suggests multiple CH2 groups in a ring or similar structure. Adamantane has four six-membered rings, so perhaps the product retains some of that structure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe 1,3-dibromoadamantane eliminating two HBr forms an adamantyl group with a double bond. But how would that lead to a ketone?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclohexenone derivative. But then the IR would fit the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the NMR again.

The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be adjacent to an oxygen. Maybe it's a CH2-O-R group. If it's a ketone, perhaps the adjacent CH2 is at higher ppm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ether's CH2, like in an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the IR. 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl, maybe a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone.

So, how can 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone upon heating with KOH?

Hmm. Maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic attack, but KOH is a base, not a nucleophile in substitution. Or perhaps it's a double elimination to form the ketone.

Wait, consider that 1,3-dibromoadamantane could undergo dehydrohalogenation twice, but in a way that forms a ketone.

Wait, perhaps via a di-elimination to form a carbonyl. For example, each Br is on adjacent carbons, and each elimination forms a bond, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, imagine two adjacent carbons each with a Br. When each loses HBr, perhaps the two carbons combine, leaving a double bond. But that would form an alkene, not a ketone. Alternatively, if the two Brs are on the same carbon, losing two HBr would form a carbonyl. But the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, which are vicinal, not geminal.

Hmm, maybe I'm not getting it right. Let me think about the NMR again. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is a singlet? Or maybe a triplet? Wait, the question doesn't specify splitting, so perhaps it's a singlet. That would suggest that the two H are equivalent and not split by neighboring H.

If it's a singlet, perhaps it's a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom or a carbonyl. So maybe the structure is something like (CH2)CO. Wait, but then product 1 would be a ketone like (CH2)CO-R.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is a CH2 group adjacent to two carbonyls, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the product is an epoxide, but I don't think that fits the IR. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ether, but the IR doesn't support that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol, but that doesn't fit with the IR data either.

Wait, perhaps the initial step isn't elimination. What if it's a substitution? But KOH is more of a base than a nucleophile here. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a coupling, but I don't see how that would form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product 1 is a diketone, but I'm not sure how that would form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and the NMR data supports that. So, the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl, and the 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be the bridgehead CH2 groups in adamantane.

If product 1 is a ketone, then step 2 is treating with aluminum isopropoxide. What does that do? Aluminum isopropoxide is often used in the formation of enol ethers or in some ring-opening reactions, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and step 2 is a ring-opening or some kind of acid-catalyzed rearrangement. For example, if product 1 is a cyclopropane ketone, then heating with a Lewis acid might cause it to open into something else.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is formed via a Friedel-Crafts type reaction, but that's for arenes, and adamantane isn't aromatic.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether formed from the ketone. But how? Maybe via an acid-catalyzed dehydration, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether. Then, when ozone is bubbled through product 2, it would break the double bond into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but let's think about step 3. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide. That's a standard ozonolysis procedure, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, product 2 must have a double bond.

So, product 3 would be the ozonolysis product, which would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

So, putting it all together:

1. Product 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → ketone (since IR shows C=O).

2. Product 2: Product 1 heated with aluminum isopropoxide → forms an enol ether (if product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 could be an enol ether via acid-catalyzed dehydration).

Wait, but enol ethers are formed from ketones via acid-catalyzed dehydration, so that makes sense. So product 2 would have an enol ether structure, which is an alkene.

Then, product 2 is ozonolyzed to form product 3, which would be carbonyl-containing compounds.

But the question is about the NMR of product 3, focusing on the most deshielded H and its coupling pattern.

Wait, let me try to outline the possible structures.

Product 1: a ketone derived from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The structure could be something like bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one or similar. But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bridgehead ketone.

Product 2: Enol ether formed from product 1. That would involve converting the ketone into an enol ether (an alkene adjacent to an oxygen). So, the enol ether would have a structure like O-CH2-CH2-O, but more likely with a double bond, like CH2=CH-O-... Wait, no, enol ethers are R-O-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. Wait, no, enol ethers have the structure R-O-CH2-CH2-... Wait, no, more accurately, an enol ether is R-O-CR2=CR2, where the double bond is between the carbons attached to the oxygen.

So, product 2 would have a structure where the ketone is converted into an enol ether, introducing a double bond.

Then, ozonolysis of the enol ether would cleave the double bond. Ozonolysis typically breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, the ozonolysis would produce two carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

But wait, in the case of an enol ether (like R-O-CH2-CH2-OR'), ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. For example, an enol ether like CH2=CH-O-R would upon ozonolysis form two carbonyl compounds.

Wait, but in the enol ether, the structure is R-O-CH2-CH2-R', but with a double bond in between. Wait, no, the correct structure is R-O-CH2-CH2-R would not have a double bond. Wait, no, an enol ether has a structure like R-O-CH2-CH2-R with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. No, wait, the enol ether is R-O-CH2-CH2-OR, but that's not correct. Let me think: enol ethers are formed from ketones via dehydration to form an enol, which then loses a water molecule to form an enol ether. So, the structure would be R-O-CH2-CH2-R, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, it's R-O-CH2-CH2-R with a double bond, making it R-O-CH2-CH2-R → R-O-CH₂-CH₂-R with a double bond, which would be R-O-CH₂-CH₂-OR. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol ether has the structure R-O-CR2=CR2. So, the double bond is adjacent to the oxygen.

So, upon ozonolysis of an enol ether, the double bond would be cleaved, and each end would form a carbonyl group. So, for example, if the enol ether is R-O-CH2-CH2-O-R', ozonolysis would break the central double bond, producing R-O-CHO and R'-O-CHO, perhaps. But that depends on the structure.

But in any case, after ozonolysis, product 3 would have carbonyl groups. The question is about the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3, which would likely be near the carbonyl group.

So, let's imagine product 3 is a diketone, perhaps. The most deshielded H would be adjacent to the carbonyl, perhaps in a CH2 group next to the carbonyl.

In such a case, the H would be split based on neighboring Hs. For example, if the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, the splitting could be a triplet or more.

Wait, but let's think about the structure.

Suppose product 2 is an enol ether with a structure like O-CH2-CH2-O (but that's not correct; more accurately, the enol ether would have a double bond adjacent to an oxygen). So, perhaps it's O-CH2-CH2-O but with a double bond. Wait, no, I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol ether has a structure like O-CH₂-CH₂-O but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So, it's O-CH₂-CH₂-O but as O-CR₂=CR₂-O.

Wait, no, the correct structure is like R-O-CH₂-CH₂-O-R, but with a double bond, so it's an enol ether, which is R-O-CH₂-CH₂-O-R with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So, it's R-O-CH₂-CH₂-O-R → R-O-CH₂-CH₂-O-R, but with a double bond between the two CH₂, making it R-O-CH₂-CH₂-O-R → R-O-CH₂-CH₂-O-R with CH₂-CH₂ as CH₂=CH.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as O-CH₂-CH₂-O with a double bond, making it O-CH₂-CH₂-O but where the two CH₂ are CH₂=CH.

Wait, no, that's not right. The enol ether structure is R-O-CR₁=CR₂-OR', where the double bond is between the two carbons attached to the oxygen.

So, for example, the structure could be O-CH₂-CH₂-O but with a double bond, so O-CH₂-CH₂-O → O-CH₂-CH₂-O with the double bond between the CH₂ groups, making it O-CH₂-CH₂-O → O-CH₂-CH₂-O, but that's not correct. Alternatively, the structure is R-O-CH₂-CH₂-O-R, but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups, so O-CH₂-CH₂-O becomes O-CH₂-CH₂-O but with a double bond, which would make it O-CH₂-CH₂-O → O-CH₂-CH₂-O, but that's not possible since that would require a triple bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Ozonolysis of an enol ether would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, if the enol ether is R-O-CH₂-CH₂-O-R, then ozonolysis would break the double bond, which is between the two CH₂ groups, leading to two carbonyl groups. So, the product would be two R-O-CHO groups. But perhaps the actual structure is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol ether is R-O-CH₂-CH₂-O-R, but with a double bond between the two CH₂, making it R-O-CH₂-CH₂-O-R → R-O-CH₂-CH₂-O-R but as R-O-CH₂-CH₂-O-R → R-O-CH₂-CH₂-O-R with a double bond between the CH₂ groups. So ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups, giving R-O-CHO and R-O-CHO, perhaps. But then, the product would be two aldehyde groups attached to the same oxygen, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the enol ether is a cyclic structure, like a cyclic ether with a double bond. For example, a cyclopropane ring with an oxygen and a double bond. Then, ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol ether is more like R-O-CH₂-CH₂-O-R, but with a double bond, so it's R-O-CH₂-CH₂-O-R → R-O-CH₂-CH₂-O-R but with a double bond between the CH₂ groups. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups, giving R-O-CHO and R-O-CHO. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider that product 2 is an alkene, and product 3 is the ozonolysis product, which would have carbonyl groups.

Now, going back to product 3's NMR: the most deshielded H would be near a carbonyl group, perhaps in a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl. So, that H would be deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl.

The coupling pattern would depend on how many neighboring Hs are present. For example, if the CH2 group is next to another CH2 group, each H would couple with two Hs on the adjacent group. So, each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to a CH group with two Hs, each H would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but let's consider the structure. Suppose product 3 has a structure like (R)CO-CH2-CH2-(CO)R'. The CH2 groups next to the carbonyl would each have two Hs, and each H would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group. So, each H would be a triplet.

In that case, the most deshielded H (on the CH2 next to the carbonyl) would be a triplet due to coupling with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2.

But wait, in product 3, after ozonolysis, each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group. So, perhaps each CH2 group next to the carbonyl has two Hs, and each H is split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, the splitting would be a triplet for each H.

Wait, but wait, if each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, each H would couple with two Hs, leading to a triplet. So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

But looking at the options, option A is a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, but the splitting is more complex. For example, if each H in the CH2 is coupling with two Hs on one side and two on the other, but that would complicate the splitting.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the CH2 is next to a CH group with two Hs, leading to a doublet of triplets or something else.

Alternatively, if each H in the CH2 is coupling with two Hs on one adjacent group and one H on another, the pattern could be more complex.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of a simpler case.

If product 3 has a structure where the most deshielded H is in a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 group (like CH2-CH2), each H would couple with the two Hs on the neighboring CH2. So, the splitting would be a triplet. So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

So, the correct answer would be A) triplet.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning leading to the answer:

1. **Step 1: Reaction with KOH**  
   When 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, the IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group. This suggests that two molecules of HBr are eliminated, forming a ketone. The NMR data supports this:  
   - **4.79 ppm (2H)**: Likely a CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl.  
   - **2.41–2.23 ppm (10H)**: Protons from the adamantane framework.  
   - **1.94 ppm (2H)**: Likely a CH₂ group in a different environment.  
   Thus, product 1 is a ketone derived from 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

2. **Step 2: Reaction with aluminum isopropoxide**  
   Heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely converts the ketone into an enol ether. This involves dehydration of the ketone, forming a double bond adjacent to an oxygen atom. The resulting product (product 2) is an enol ether with a double bond.

3. **Step 3: Ozonolysis**  
   Ozonolysis of product 2 cleaves the double bond in the enol ether, forming carbonyl groups. The resulting product (product 3) is a diketone or a compound with carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely in a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **NMR Analysis of Product 3**  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is in a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen is split by the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a **triplet** coupling pattern.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet. 

Answer: A
