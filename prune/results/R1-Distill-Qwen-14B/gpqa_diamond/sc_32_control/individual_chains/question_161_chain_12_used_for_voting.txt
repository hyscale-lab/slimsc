Alright, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths of gas molecules. Hmm, okay, let's think this through. 

The scenario is that Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a vacuum pump to get an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, which is better for imaging because fewer gas molecules mean less interference, right? But some gas particles are still there, and he measures their mean free path as λ1. Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, I remember that from my studies.

Now, when he starts the electron beam, something happens. The mean free path changes to λ2. But the temperature is the same, so why would λ change? He's wondering why λ2 isn't the same as λ1.

Wait, I think the mean free path depends on the pressure and the cross-sectional area for collisions. The formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T temperature, d the diameter of the molecules, and P pressure. Oh wait, another version is λ = 1/(√2 * n * σ), where n is number density and σ is the collision cross-section.

But wait, when the electron beam is on, what's happening? The electrons are moving through the gas, and the gas molecules are there. The electrons can scatter the gas molecules. Oh, but how does that affect the mean free path of the gas particles themselves?

Wait, the mean free path of the gas molecules is about how far they go without colliding. But when the electron beam is on, maybe the electrons are causing ionization or some interaction with the gas molecules. So the gas molecules might be getting charged, acting as ions. Hmm, ions have different properties than neutral molecules. 

In a vacuum, charged particles (like ions) have different behavior. But wait, in a strong electric field, like from the electron beam, maybe the ions are getting accelerated. Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam increases the effective pressure because the electrons are interacting with the gas, causing more collisions or altering the mean free path.

Wait, but the mean free path of the gas molecules is λ1 when the electron beam is off. When the beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are getting excited or ionized, which could change their effective cross-section for collisions. If the gas becomes partially ionized, the ions might have a different mean free path than the neutral molecules.

Wait, but the question states that the mean free path λ2 is different from λ1. The temperature is the same, so T hasn't changed. But the presence of the electron beam could be introducing other factors. Let me think about the factors affecting the mean free path.

In the initial state (electron beam off), the gas molecules have a certain mean free path λ1. When the beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are bombarded by the electrons, causing them to ionize. If they ionize, they become charged particles. Charged particles in a vacuum have different behavior. But wait, in a vacuum, ions might have a longer mean free path because their collisions are less frequent if they're moving faster or if their cross-section changes.

Wait, but wait. If the gas is at a very low pressure, the mean free path is already large. When you have charged particles, like ions, their mean free path can be longer than neutral molecules because the cross-section for collisions might be smaller. Or wait, maybe the opposite. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. For charged particles, if they're in an electric field, they might be accelerated, moving faster. But the mean free path depends on the number density and the collision cross-section. If the gas is ionized, maybe the number of collisions decreases because ions might have different interactions. Or perhaps ionization doesn't directly affect the mean free path of the neutral gas molecules, but rather introduces other effects.

Alternatively, the electron beam's presence might cause more gas molecules to be in motion, maybe increasing the effective pressure or number density, but the question says the temperature is the same. Oh, but the electron beam could be heating the gas, but no, the temperature remains same as per the problem statement.

Wait, another angle: when the electron beam is active, the primary electrons are moving at high speeds, which might cause more collisions with the gas molecules. But wait, that's about the electrons. The question is about the gas's mean free path.

Wait, maybe the electron beam's electric field affects the gas. The gas molecules could get ionized, creating a plasma. In a plasma, the mean free path is generally shorter because of increased collisions between ions and electrons. But wait, in a plasma, the electrons are free, so maybe the gas's neutral molecules are less, which could affect their own mean free path.

Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam may cause the gas to be ionized, so the number of neutral gas molecules decreases. If the number density decreases, then the mean free path increases. Because mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the number density (n), since λ = 1/(n * σ), where σ is the collision cross-section. So if n decreases, λ increases.

Wait, but why would the number density decrease? If some gas becomes ionized, the number of neutral molecules (n) would decrease, as they're being ionized into ions. So the neutral molecules are fewer, so n goes down, so λ = 1/(n * σ) goes up. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

So in that case, λ2 would be greater than λ1. But the options don't have that as a direct choice. Let me look at the options again.

Options:
A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1
B) λ2 = λ1, discrepancy
C) λ2 < λ1
D) λ1 < λ2 <1.22 λ1

So if λ2 is greater than λ1, then options A or D are possibilities. But D is λ2 between 1.22 λ1 and λ1, which is not possible because λ2 is larger. Oh no, D says λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 λ1, which would mean λ2 is larger than λ1 but less than 1.22 times. So if λ2 is larger, the possible options are A or D.

Wait, but Mike is seeing λ2 as different—so why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on?

Wait, another possibility: the electron beam causes gas molecules to be excited or to move, which could increase the effective temperature, but the problem says the temperature remains the same. So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam's presence leads to more collisions between gas molecules because the beam's energy transfers to the gas, causing more movement. But if the temperature is same, the average kinetic energy is same, so same speed.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to be more ionized, so some gas becomes charged, and the neutral gas's number density decreases. So the mean free path λ for the neutral gas would increase. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

If that's the case, then λ2 > λ1. So λ2 is greater than λ1. Now, the options that have λ2 greater than λ1 are A and D.

Wait, but Mike's observation is that λ2 is different. He expects λ1, but sees λ2. So why would it change? Well, maybe the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to be in a different state.

Wait, another angle: the mean free path is calculated based on the assumption that the gas is in thermal equilibrium. When the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas is being heated by the beam, but the problem states the temperature remains same. So that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to be under a different pressure gradient or affects the vacuum pumps' performance, but the problem doesn't mention that. The pressure is given as ultra-high vacuum, same conditions.

Wait, maybe when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are being bombarded and scattered more, which increases the effective cross-section. Alternatively, the presence of the beam could cause the gas to have a different effective pressure.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes more ionization, which introduces more charged particles into the system. Charged particles would have a mean free path that's different. But wait, the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules. Wait, if the gas is partially ionized, the number of neutral gas molecules decreases, so the mean free path for the neutral gas should increase. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

So if λ2 is larger, then λ2 >= λ1. Looking at the options, option A is λ2 >= 1.22 λ1, which is a specific value. But why 1.22?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. The mean free path in electron microscopy can also be affected by the interaction with the electron beam. Oh wait, the mean free path of the electrons is different from the gas molecules. But the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that when the electron beam is on, the gas is subjected to an electric field, which causes the gas molecules to move in a particular direction, thereby changing their effective density in the sample compartment. But that's a bit abstract.

Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam could cause the gas to be in a state of excitation, leading to more frequent collisions between molecules, which would decrease the mean free path. But that would require the effective cross-section to increase, perhaps because the molecules are larger or moving faster. But if the gas is at same temperature, same speed.

Wait, maybe the electron beam's energy is causing the gas to be excited, leading to more frequent collisions. So the mean free path would decrease, so λ2 < λ1. That would make option C correct.

But earlier I thought it would increase. Hmm, conflicting possibilities.

Wait, let me think again. Mean free path is λ = 1/(n σ). So if n (number density) increases, λ decreases. How would the electron beam affect n?

Wait, the number density n is given by P/(k*T). Since pressure P is the same, and T is same, n remains same. So n doesn't change. So if n is same, then any change in λ would have to be due to a change in σ, the collision cross-section.

So σ is the effective cross-section for collisions. If the gas molecules are ionized, their cross-section might change. Neutral molecules might have a certain σ, while ions could have a different σ.

Alternatively, perhaps when ionized, the effective cross-section for neutral molecules to collide is different. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam could cause the gas to be in a different state, maybe causing more collisions between gas molecules. Or perhaps the electron beam itself is causing additional scattering, which would affect the electrons' mean free path, but the question is about the gas.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more likely to collide, so σ increases, leading to a shorter mean free path. So λ2 would be less than λ1, making option C correct.

But why would σ increase? If the gas is ionized, charged particles might have a different cross-section. Alternatively, maybe the ions have a larger effective size, so σ increases, leading to shorter λ.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think of it another way. 

In the initial state, without the electron beam, the gas has a mean free path λ1. When the beam is on, the gas's mean free path changes to λ2.

If the beam causes the gas to be ionized, the number of neutral molecules decreases. So the number density of neutral molecules is lower, leading to a higher mean free path for the remaining neutral molecules. So λ2 would be larger than λ1. So λ2 > λ1.

But if the presence of the beam causes more collisions, perhaps because the ions are moving faster or something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the presence of the beam could cause the gas to become more dense in some regions, but that would require the pressure to change, which it's not.

Wait, but pressure is the same because the vacuum is the same. So n = P/(k*T) remains same. So unless σ changes, λ stays same.

Wait, oh! Maybe when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are more likely to interact with the electrons, causing more ionization. Therefore, the number of neutral gas molecules (n) remains same, but the effective cross-section for collisions (σ) could increase because the gas is more ionized. Wait, no, if gas is ionized, the neutral molecules are fewer. So n decreases for neutral gas. So for the remaining neutral gas, n is lower, so λ increases.

Wait, but the cross-section for neutral molecules to collide with each other is σ. If the gas is ionized, maybe the neutral molecules are moving faster, increasing σ, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam introduces more energy into the system, causing the gas to have a higher effective temperature, but the problem states the temperature is same.

This is getting really confusing. Let me try to think about what the mean free path of gas molecules depends on.

The mean free path λ is given by λ = 1/(√2 n σ). So if n is the number density and σ is the collision cross-section.

In the initial state, n is fixed by pressure and temperature. So when the beam is on, if the gas is ionized, the number of neutral molecules (n) is lower, so λ2 = 1/(n' σ') where n' < n and σ' may be higher or lower.

Wait, but if the gas becomes ionized, then n' (number density of neutral gas) decreases, so 1/(n' σ') increases, so λ2 would be longer. So λ2 > λ1.

So in that scenario, λ2 is greater than λ1. So looking back at the options, option A says λ2 >=1.22 λ1. So λ2 is at least 1.22 times λ1.

But why 1.22? I'm not sure. 1.22 is approximately sqrt(5/2), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam leads to a change in the effective cross-section because the gas molecules are more likely to interact in a different way, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe when the electron beam is active, the gas is subjected to an electric field, causing the ions to move, which could affect the overall pressure distribution, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam introduces a current, which could cause some sort of gas heating, but the temperature remains same.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the electron beam scatters off the gas molecules, which effectively reduces the number of gas molecules in the path, thus increasing the mean free path. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to become more ionized, leading to a lower number of neutral molecules, so their mean free path increases.

So then λ2 would be larger than λ1. So the options would be A or D. But without more details, it's hard to say.

Wait, but the problem says that the mean free path was no longer λ1. So let's think about factors that would affect the mean free path.

If the electron beam causes the gas to ionize, leading to a lower n for neutral gas, λ increases. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

So the mean free path would be longer, so λ2 > λ1. So the only options that have λ2 greater than λ1 are A and D. But D says λ1 < λ2 <1.22 λ1, which would imply a small increase, but why would the presence of the beam cause such a specific change.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam doesn't change the mean free path of the gas molecules because factors like pressure and temperature remain same. So λ2 would be same as λ1. But that's option B. But the question says that Mike found it wasn't λ1 anymore, so B can't be correct.

So the options that are possible are A, C, D.

But according to the earlier reasoning, the presence of the beam causing ionization would lead to a longer mean free path, so λ2 > λ1. So the only option that fits is A or D. But the question doesn't provide info to distinguish between them.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam causes the gas to have a higher effective pressure, which would lower the mean free path. But that would require an increase in pressure, which the question doesn't mention.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about what makes the mean free path change. If the electron beam adds energy to the system, causing the gas to expand, that would lower pressure, but then the problem states the pressure is the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam introduces more collisions between gas molecules, which would decrease the mean free path. But how?

Wait, the beam might cause the gas molecules to be more energetic, but the same temperature. So maybe σ increases, leading to shorter mean free paths.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam's presence creates a situation where gas molecules are more likely to collide with the walls of the compartment, but that would require a change in the system.

Wait, another thought: mean free path is for molecules moving in all directions. If the electron beam is a directed beam, perhaps it affects the distribution of gas molecules, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam creates a situation where the gas is in a state of being more ionized, so the gas molecules' mean free path is determined by their interactions with the ions, which may have a different cross-section. So if the cross-section is larger, then λ would be shorter.

Wait, but the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules, which are mostly neutral if the ionization is low. If ionization is high, the number of neutral molecules is low, so their mean free path increases.

So I'm more confident now that λ2 > λ1, which points to option A or D. However, the question is why.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas to be more ionized, so the effective number of collisions between neutral molecules decreases. Therefore, the mean free path λ increases.

In that case, λ2 > λ1, so the correct option would be A or D.

But the question states that the mean free path is no longer λ1, but it's unclear by how much.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to have a higher effective pressure, but that contradicts the problem statement.

Hmm. I'm not entirely sure, but based on the reasoning, the mean free path increases when the electron beam is on. So the correct answer must be either A or D.

Wait, what's the value 1.22? I remember that in electron microscopy, the Scherer's equation relates the scattering angle to the coherence length, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas's mean free path is affected by the electron scattering. But the question is about the gas molecule's mean free path, not the electrons.

Wait, another thought: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are being hit by electrons, which could cause them to move or change their velocity. This might increase the effective number of collisions, thus decreasing the mean free path. So λ2 would be less than λ1, making option C correct.

But earlier reasoning suggested the opposite.

Wait, but the mean free path is for the gas molecules, not the electrons. So the electrons' beam would affect the gas molecules, but how?

If the electrons are causing the gas molecules to scatter more, that would increase the collision rate, leading to shorter mean free paths. So λ2 < λ1, option C.

But earlier I thought that because ionization would lower the number density of neutral gas, leading to longer mean free paths. Now I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam increases the effective pressure because as electrons collide with gas molecules, it's like adding more pressure. But pressure is force per area, and I'm not sure how that would directly affect the mean free path of the gas.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam introduces more energy into the system, causing the gas molecules to move faster, which would increase their speed. Since mean free path λ is proportional to velocity (v), because λ = v * τ, where τ is the mean time between collisions. If v increases, λ increases.

But wait, if the temperature is same, average speed of gas molecules is same. So v doesn't change. So that's not it.

Hmm, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to make a decision based on what I know.

If the electron beam causes the gas to be more ionized, neutral molecules are fewer. So for the remaining neutral molecules, the mean free path increases. So λ2 > λ1. So the options are A or D.

But the question is, which one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path of the gas molecules when the electron beam is on is longer because the electrons are contributing to the movement of gas molecules, but I'm not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam causes the gas to have a higher effective temperature, but the problem says temperature remains same.

Wait, maybe I should think about the formula for mean free path again.

λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * P)

If pressure is same, temperature same, then λ should remain same. But why is Mike seeing a change?

Wait, but perhaps when the electron beam is on, the effective pressure changes. But pressure is a measure of the force per area due to collisions. If the gas is ionized, maybe the pressure changes. Because ions have different ways of contributing to pressure.

Wait, the ideal gas law applies to neutral gases, but when you have charged particles, it's a plasma, and the behavior is different.

In a plasma, the pressure is related to the number density of ions and electrons. But if the gas becomes partially ionized, the number of neutral molecules decreases, but the number of ions increases.

But the pressure in the system is determined by the total number of particles (ions and electrons) and their momentum changes. So perhaps the pressure remains the same, but the mean free path for the neutral gas increases.

Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam may cause a change in the effective pressure experienced by the gas, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the mean free path is not just about the gas molecules colliding with each other, but also with the electrons. So when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are colliding with electrons as well, which would effectively increase the collision rate, thus decreasing the mean free path.

So if gas molecules are colliding with both other gas molecules and electrons, their mean free path would be shorter than λ1, which was calculated without considering electron collisions.

So in that case, λ2 would be less than λ1. So option C would be correct.

Ah, that makes sense. Because in the initial state, the mean free path was calculated without considering electron collisions. When the beam is on, gas molecules can collide with the electrons, leading to more frequent collisions, thus shorter mean free path.

So λ2 = λ1 / (1 + (electrons collisions considered)). So λ2 < λ1.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C: λ2 < λ1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves analyzing the change in the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in a high-resolution transmission electron microscope when the electron beam is activated. Initially, the mean free path is determined to be λ1 under ultra-high vacuum conditions, assuming no electron beam interference. However, upon activating the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ2. The task is to determine the relationship between λ2 and λ1.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mean Free Path Formula**: The mean free path λ is given by:
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} n \sigma}
   \]
   where \(n\) is the number density of gas molecules, and \(\sigma\) is the collision cross-section.

2. **Initial State (Electron Beam Off)**: The mean free path is λ1, calculated based on the gas pressure, temperature, and molecular properties.

3. **Effect of Electron Beam**: When the electron beam is activated:
   - The electron beam introduces additional interactions between the gas molecules and the electrons.
   - These interactions can cause ionization of the gas molecules, reducing the number density of neutral gas molecules (\(n\)).
   - Additionally, the presence of the electron beam increases the effective collision rate for gas molecules, as they now collide not only with each other but also with the electrons.

4. **Impact on Mean Free Path**:
   - A decrease in the number density of neutral gas molecules (\(n\)) would increase the mean free path (\(\lambda\)).
   - However, the increased collision rate due to electron interactions effectively shortens the mean free path (\(\lambda\)).
   - The combined effect is that the mean free path λ2 becomes shorter than λ1.

5. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A (\(\lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1\))**: This implies a significant increase in the mean free path, which is inconsistent with the reasoning that the electron beam reduces the mean free path.
   - **Option B (\(\lambda_2 = \lambda_1\))**: This suggests no change in the mean free path, but the problem explicitly states that λ2 is different from λ1, ruling out this option.
   - **Option C (\(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\))**: This aligns with the reasoning that the electron beam shortens the mean free path due to increased collisions.
   - **Option D (\(\lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < 1.22 \lambda_1\))**: This implies a small increase in the mean free path, which contradicts the expected decrease caused by electron interactions.

### Conclusion:
The presence of the electron beam increases the collision rate of gas molecules, effectively reducing their mean free path. Therefore, the correct conclusion is that \(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\).

**Answer: C**
