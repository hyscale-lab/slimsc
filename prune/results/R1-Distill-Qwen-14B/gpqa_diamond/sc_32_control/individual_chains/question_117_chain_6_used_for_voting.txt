Okay, so I've got this question here about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism... I remember that's when compounds can rotate plane-polarized light because they have chiral centers. Chiral centers are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, right?

The question lists four moieties and asks which show optical isomerism. Let's go through each one.

1. The first one is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Oh wait, biphenyls can have different substituents in the ortho positions. But wait, for optical isomerism, we need a chiral center. Does this compound have any? Let me think. The structure is a biphenyl group with substituents on each benzene ring. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring. So each ring has two substituents (the ester groups) and nitro groups at 6 and 6'. Hmm, but the central carbon where the two benzene rings are connected... is that a chiral center? Wait, biphenyl's central carbon is single-bonded to two benzene rings. Oh wait, no, the central atom is a carbon, but it's connected to two phenyl groups. Wait, no, the biphenyl is a single bond between the two benzene rings. So each ring is attached via a single carbon. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, the structure is 1,1'-biphenyl, so the two benzene rings are connected at the 1 and 1' positions. So the central carbon is connected to two benzene rings. So that carbon is attached to two identical phenyl groups, right? So that can't be a chiral center because it's attached to two same groups. Hmm. But wait, maybe the substituents on the rings have chiral centers. Let me look at the groups: each has a COOCH3 (carboxylate ester) and a nitro group at 6,6'. So each benzene ring has substituents at 2 and 6 positions. Wait, but on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. So each ring has two groups at opposite ends. Are those substituents causing any chiral centers? Let's see: the 2 position has a COOCH3. Wait, wait, no, the substituents on each benzene are at 2 and 6. But the COOCH3 is attached to a carbon that's part of the ester. So the ester group is O-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, the ester is O-CO-OCH3. Wait, the structure is the dimethyl ester, so each COOCH3 is attached to the benzene. So each benzene has two substituents: one at 2 and 6. So each benzene has a COOCH3 and a nitro group. Wait, but each of these substituents is a meta direction to each other? So the biphenyl structure is symmetric in some way? Maybe each substituent is on opposite sides, so perhaps there's a plane of symmetry. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the substituents might be arranged in a way that allows for stereoisomerism. Wait, but for optical isomerism, the molecule must be chiral, which requires no plane of symmetry. So if the substituents are such that the molecule isn't symmetrical, perhaps it can have enantiomers. Alternatively, maybe the substitution leads to the molecule being a meso compound if it has a plane of symmetry. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions that could lead to geometric isomerism, but that's E/Z isomerism, not optical. So maybe this compound doesn't have a chiral center, but perhaps the biphenyl system is causing some kind of axial chirality. Oh wait, axial chirality is a thing in biphenyls, right? When the two rings are connected by a single bond, the arrangement around the bond can lead to different isomers. Like in biphenyls with substituents, the substituents can be in a trans or cis arrangement around the central bond, leading to different configurations. So if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, it can have enantiomers. So in this case, the substituents are at 6 and 6' positions. Wait, but the 6 position is across from the connecting carbon. So each ring has a substituent at 6, which is opposite the point where the rings are connected. So the two nitro groups are on the opposite sides of each ring. So the overall structure would be symmetrical, right? Because each ring is symmetrical in that way. So perhaps this molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. Hence, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Let me think again. The structure is 6,6'-dinitro, so each benzene has a nitro group at position 6, which is the same as the position opposite the connecting carbon. So the two nitro groups are on opposite sides. So perhaps the molecule has two planes of symmetry. So maybe it's not chiral. So this compound might not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. The second one is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is like this: the ester is O-CO-OCH3, attached to a propanoate chain. The propanoate is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no, wait: 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the structure where the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the propanoate. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait no, propionate is CH2CH2COO, but 2-hydroxy would mean the OH is on the second carbon. So it's CH2CH(OH)COOCH3? Or wait, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HO-CH2-COOCH3, no. Wait, maybe it's CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So the structure is like CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, wait, no, the formula is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, so the propanoate is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3? Let's count. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- as the acid, so the ester is CH2CH2COOCH3. But 2-hydroxy means the OH is on the second carbon. So CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, the propanoate is CH2-CH2-COO-. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second CH2. So the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. But wait, wait, the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbon chain is three carbons, with COOCH3 on the third, OH on the second, and the first carbon is CH2. So the OH is on the second carbon, which is connected to two CH2 groups and the COOCH3. Wait, so the second carbon has: two CH2 groups (one from the first carbon and one to the third), an OH, and a COOCH3. So four different groups attached to the second carbon? Wait, the second carbon is connected to: OH, CH2CH2COOCH3 (wait, no). Let me think again. The structure: the propanoate is O=C-OCH3 attached to a CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? Wait no, maybe I miswrote. Let's number it correctly. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- as the acid, so when esterified, it's CH2CH2COOCH3. The 2-hydroxy would be the OH on the middle CH2. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the second carbon (the middle one) has:

- One OH group
- One CH2 group connected to the first carbon (CH2OH)
- One COOCH3 group connected to the third carbon (CH2COOCH3)
- And the fourth group is the other CH2 (from the middle to the first and third carbons). Wait, no, the middle carbon is connected to two CH2 groups and the OH and COOCH3? So the middle carbon is CH(OH), connected to two CH2 groups (one on each side) and the COOCH3. Wait, no, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, so the middle carbon is CH2. No, wait, the structure is: the first carbon is CH2, the second is CH(OH), and the third is COOCH3. So the second carbon is CH(OH) connected to the first (CH2-) and the third (COOCH3). So the groups attached to the second carbon are:

- OH
- CH2CH2...
Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to draw it mentally as:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, that's 1-hydroxypropanoate. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The ester would be CH2CH2COOCH3. 2-hydroxypropanoate would have an OH on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. So the second carbon has:

- CH2- (from the first carbon)
- COOCH3 (from the third)
- OH
- and another CH2 group? No, wait wait. The second carbon is CH(OH) connected to the first (CH2-) and the third (COOCH3). Wait, but that would make only three substituents. Wait no, the second carbon is CH(OH) with bonds to:

- the first carbon (CH2-)
- the third carbon (COOCH3)
- an OH
- and what else? Oh wait, I think I'm forgetting the hydrogen. So the second carbon would have:

- CH2- (from the first carbon)
- COOCH3 (from the third)
- OH
- and a hydrogen.

So four different groups: CH2-, COOCH3, OH, and H. So that carbon is a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center. So this compound would have optical isomerism. So it should show optical activity.

3. Benzophenone. Structure is two benzene rings connected by a ketone group. So, it's (Ph)2CO. So the structure is Ar-CO-Ar. Now, the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two phenyl groups. So the central carbon has:

- two phenyl groups (same)
- a double bond to O
- and another single bond to O? Wait, no. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO, which is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. So the central carbon has:

- two phenyl groups (same)
- a double bond to oxygen
- a single bond to another phenyl? Wait no, it's Ph-C(=O)-Ph. So the central carbon is the one in the ketone. So it's connected to two phenyl groups, a double bond to O, and another single bond to O? No, wait, the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. So the central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups, a carbonyl oxygen (double bond), and another oxygen as part of the carbonyl. Wait, no, the carbonyl group is C=O, so the carbon is double-bonded to O and has two single bonds to the phenyl groups. So the central carbon has three substituents: two phenyl and a double bond to O. So it's trigonal, not tetrahedral. So no chiral center. Therefore, benzophenone cannot exhibit optical isomerism. So it's not chiral.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. The structure is (Z)-butenedioic acid, so the di-ester would be CH2CH(COOCH3)CH(COOCH3)CH2. Wait, no, wait. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid. Wait no, maleic acid is cis, and fumarate is the trans form. So the di-ester, dimethyl fumarate, would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is CH2CH2(COOCH3) but with a double bond. Wait, more accurately, it's CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3? No, no, wait. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait no, wait. No, wait, maleic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's wrong. Wait, no, maleic acid is HOOC-CHCH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on adjacent carbons, and the double bond between those two middle carbons. So the structure is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. Fumarate is the trans isomer, so when it's esterified, it becomes dimethyl fumarate: CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, no, perhaps the structure is O=C-(CH2) groups.

Wait, no. Let me get this right. Maleic acid is (Z)-HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H, and fumaric acid is (E)-HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So the di-ester would be (E)-CH2COOCH3-CH2-COOCH3? Wait, no, more accurately, it's (E)-CH2COOCH2-CH2COOCH3? No, I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: the structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3. No, wait, no, the structure of fumarate is CH2CH2 with the two ester groups on opposite ends. So correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. No, wait, the correct structure is CH2-CH(COOCH3)2 with a double bond between the first and second carbons. So, it's CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: when fumarate is formed, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, with each of those carbons bearing an ester group. So each of those carbons is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. So the structure is CH2-CH2 with double bond between the two middle carbons, each attached to a COOCH3. Wait, I think it's more like:

O
||
O-C-OCH3

on each end of the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3   CH2=CH-C-O-OCH3

Wait, maybe it's:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2. No, because that would be both ester groups on the same carbon. No, for fumarate, each of the two middle carbons has an ester group. So the structure is CH2-C(COOCH3)=C(COOCH3)-CH2. No, wait, perhaps that's:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
     /
COOCH3

So, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So in dimethyl fumarate, you have a trans configuration across the double bond. Now, in terms of stereoisomerism, fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate. But here, the question is about optical isomerism. So for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it needs a chiral center or some other form of chirality, like axial chirality in biphenyls. But in dimethyl fumarate, the molecule has a double bond with substituents on both sides. The configuration around the double bond is E (trans), so the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me imagine: if I draw the double bond with the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the center of the double bond. So it can't be chiral because it's symmetrical. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is not chiral, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but wait a second. I thought that if a molecule has a double bond with two different substituents on each carbon, like in the case of (E) or (Z) configurations, it could have a plane of symmetry. So for example, if it's E, then the substituents are on opposite sides, creating symmetry. So in dimethyl fumarate, which is E, the molecule is symmetrical, so it's not chiral. Therefore, it doesn't have optical isomers.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because I remember that fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate, and both can have optical isomerism. Wait, no, no. Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid. When you esterify it, the molecule is (E)-CH2-CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate to say that dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center because the molecule is symmetrical. Let me think: the molecule has a central double bond, with each end attached to a COOCH3 group. So the structure is symmetrical with respect to the double bond. Hence, it's achiral. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm making a mistake. For dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite ends of the double bond. So the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thought: if the substituents around the double bond are the same on each carbon, then the molecule is symmetrical. But in dimethyl fumarate, each of the double-bonded carbons has two COOCH3 groups? No, no, each has one COOCH3 and one CH2 group. Wait, no, for fumarate, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The structure of maleic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, which is incorrect because maleic acid is actually HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So the correct structure is that the two carbonyl groups are on adjacent carbons with a double bond between them. So when esterified, it's (Z) or (E) depending on the isomer. So for fumarate, which is the trans (E) isomer, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure would be:

CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2-COOCH3?

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me try to write it correctly:

The structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, because then the double bond is between C1 and C2, and each of those carbons would have two COOCH3 groups, which isn't correct. Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to represent it as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
       \
CH2-CH2
       /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
     /
COOCH3

But that would imply the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side, which would be the cis configuration, which is maleate. Fumarate is the trans (E) isomer, so the COOCH3 groups are on opposite ends. So the structure would be:

CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2-COOCH3. No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me look for the correct structure. Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, which has the structure CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. No, wait, that would imply each of the double-bonded carbons has a COOCH3 group attached. No, wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so the diester would have both carboxylic acid groups converted to esters. So the structure would be CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. No, that can't be right because each double bond carbon would have two ester groups. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but that would mean each double bond carbon has two ester groups, which isn't possible because each can have only one substituent each. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps each double bond carbon has one ester group. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3. No, that can't be right because that would imply a single bond between the two middle carbons. Oh wait, no, the double bond is between C2 and C3, each of which has a COOCH3 group. So the structure is CH2-CH(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3)-CH2. Wait, but that can't be because that would make it a four-carbon chain with double bond between C2 and C3. Oh, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think simpler: the molecule has a central double bond with each end connected to a COOCH3 group. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. No, that can't be, because each carbon in the double bond can only have three substituents. Oh wait, perhaps each double bond carbon is connected to one COOCH3 group and two CH2 groups. No, this is getting too confusing. Alternatively, maybe the structure is O=C-(CH2) groups. Let me try to think differently. In any case, the key point is whether the molecule is symmetrical.

If the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. So for dimethyl fumarate, which is the trans isomer, the substituents are on opposite sides, but the molecule as a whole is symmetrical. Hence, it's not chiral and doesn't have optical isomerism. But wait, wait. Another approach: if a molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. So if dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry through the double bond, then it's not chiral. So in that case, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. So the four options are:

1: No optical isomerism.

2: Yes, because it has a chiral center.

3: No.

4: No, because it's symmetrical.

Wait, but earlier I thought 4 might have a different situation. Wait, no, dimethyl fumarate is symmetrical, so it can't be chiral.

Wait, but wait another thought: sometimes, molecules with all identical groups on each side can be meso compounds, which are achiral. So dimethyl fumarate, if it's symmetrical, would be a meso compound, hence not chiral. So no optical isomerism.

So which of the four compounds exhibit optical isomerism?

1: No.

2: Yes.

3: No.

4: No.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4.

B) 3 and 4.

C) 2 and 3.

D) 1 and 2.

Wait, according to my analysis, only 2 shows optical isomerism. So none of the options match because the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me re-examine each compound.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So the biphenyl has substituents at 2 and 2' positions on each ring. Each ring has a COOCH3 and a nitro group at 6 and 6' positions. Wait, but the 6 positions are on the same side as each other. So perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that allows for axial chirality. Biphenyls can exhibit axial chirality when the substituents on each ring are in a way that the overall structure lacks symmetry. So if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that their positions are not symmetrical, the molecule could be chiral. So in this case, each ring has a COOCH3 and a nitro group. Are these substituents arranged in such a way that the molecule is asymmetrical?

Looking at the substituents: each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2'. Wait, 6 is the para position relative to the connecting carbon. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. Wait, no, each ring is 1,1' connected, so the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So the nitro groups are at 6 on each ring. So in that case, both nitro groups are on the same side relative to the central bond. Or are they? Wait, in a biphenyl, the 6 position is the para position across from the 1 position. So if the rings are connected at 1 and 1', then the 6 positions are in the same direction relative to each ring. So each ring has a nitro group on the same side. So maybe the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule as a whole has no plane of symmetry, making it chiral. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has two planes of symmetry, making it achiral. But I'm not sure. I think in this case, the compound might exhibit axial chirality, thus showing optical isomerism. So maybe option 1 does have optical isomerism.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again. If the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, it's chiral. If the substituents are both in the same relative positions, then maybe the molecule is symmetrical. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that their positions create a chiral axis, then the molecule is chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps this structure is similar to dinitrophenyl compounds, which can be chiral. For example, 1,1'-dinitro-2,2'-dichloro-1,1'-biphenyl-4-carboxylate is a known chiral compound. So in this case, the substituents at 2 and 2' on each ring, along with the nitro groups at 6 and 6', might create a chiral center or axial chirality. So if each ring has a COOCH3 and a NO2 group, and these are arranged in such a way that the biphenyl is not symmetrical, then the molecule would have optical isomerism.

So perhaps compound 1 is chiral and shows optical isomerism.

So, if 1 and 2 are the correct ones, then option D (1 and 2) would be the answer. But wait, earlier I thought 2 is correct, 1 maybe, but not sure.

Wait, another way to approach this: checking for each compound whether it has a chiral center or a plane of symmetry.

1: Each ring in the biphenyl has two substituents: COOCH3 and NO2. The substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. The 6 is para to the connecting carbon, so both nitro groups are on the same side relative to the connecting bond. So each ring has a nitro and a COOCH3 in positions that are para to each other. So the overall molecule could have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Or maybe it doesn't. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. If each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para, then the entire structure might have a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making it achiral. So perhaps it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, to recap:

1: No.

2: Yes.

3: No.

4: No.

So the only compound showing optical isomerism is 2. But looking at the options, option D is 1 and 2. So if 1 doesn't show it, then the only correct answer is option A: 1,2,4? No, but I thought 4 doesn't. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier about compound 4. Let me think again.

4. dimethyl fumarate: I thought it's symmetrical and thus achiral. But another thought: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. But dimethyl fumarate as the E isomer would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond, which would make the molecule symmetrical. Hence, no optical isomerism.

So, the only compound that shows optical isomerism is 2.

But the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. Wait, looking back at the options:

Options:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

So if only 2 is correct, none of the options match. But that can't be, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 4. Let me think again. Maybe dimethyl fumarate can have optical isomerism.

Wait, no. Fumarate is the trans isomer, which is symmetrical, so it's not chiral. Maleate is the cis isomer, which would not be symmetrical, so it would have a chiral center. Wait, no, wait. If the substituents are cis, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, for example, in the cis isomer of butenedioic acid, the two carboxylic acid groups are on the same side. So the di-ester would have both ester groups on the same side of the double bond. So the structure would be:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, but that structure would mean that each double bond carbon is attached to two COOCH3 groups, which is impossible because each carbon in a double bond can only have three substituents. So perhaps the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3.

No, that's not right because the double bond is between C2 and C3. Let me think of the correct structure again. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioate: O=C-(CH2) groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
     /
COOCH3

In this case, the substituents are on opposite ends, making the molecule symmetrical. Hence, no chirality. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate (4) doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So back to the original problem.

So which of the four compounds have optical isomerism?

1: I'm not certain. If the substituents create a chiral environment, then yes. Otherwise, no.

Compounds 2: Yes.

So looking at the options, only option D includes 1 and 2. But I'm not sure about 1.

Alternatively, perhaps I was wrong about compound 1, and it doesn't have a chiral center. So only 2, but the options don't have that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the first compound is a case of biphenyl axial chirality. Axial chirality occurs when the substituents on each ring are arranged in a non-symmetrical way around the central bond. So if the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the arrangement around the central bond is chiral, the molecule will exhibit axial chirality and hence optical isomerism.

In compound 1, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6 positions. The nitro groups are at 6, which is para to the connecting carbon. The COOCH3 groups are at 2. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2. So the arrangement is that on each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which are meta relative to each other (since 2 and 6 are separated by 4 positions in a benzene ring). So the substituents are in a meta arrangement on each ring. 

But the question is whether the overall molecule is chiral. If the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. So if the substituents on each ring are in a non-symmetrical arrangement around the central bond, then the molecule is chiral.

In this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2. So from the central bond, each ring has a nitro and a COOCH3 in specific positions. If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that their positions relative to the central bond are not symmetrical, the molecule would be chiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents on each ring are mirror images, then the molecule would be symmetrical. But if they're not, then the molecule would be chiral.

Hmm, I'm not entirely certain, but I think compound 1 does exhibit axial chirality, thus showing optical isomerism.

So perhaps both compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism. So the correct answer is D) 1 and 2.

But wait, earlier I thought that compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate) doesn't, but perhaps I was wrong. Let me think again. Another possibility: maybe dimethyl fumarate is actually (E)-configured, which is symmetrical, so no chirality. So only 1 and 2 have optical isomerism.

So the answer would be option D: 1 and 2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound is chiral, meaning it lacks a plane of symmetry and has at least one chiral center or axial chirality.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of a biphenyl system with substituents at the 2 and 6 positions on each benzene ring. The nitro groups are at the 6 positions (para to the connecting carbon), and the carboxylate ester groups are at the 2 positions. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry due to the arrangement of the substituents, which creates axial chirality. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound includes a chiral center at the second carbon of the propanoate chain. This carbon is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), a carboxylate ester group (-COOCH3), and a hydrogen atom. The presence of a chiral center means this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone consists of two benzene rings connected by a ketone group. The central carbon in the ketone group is double-bonded to oxygen and bonded to two identical phenyl groups. Since the central carbon is not bonded to four different groups, it is not a chiral center. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure (E)-CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. The two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, creating a symmetrical molecule. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism, while compounds 3 and 4 do not. The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
