Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology, specifically dealing with transmembrane receptors, ligands, and some genetic constructs. Hmm. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question describes a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. Interesting structure details, but I'm not sure how relevant they are to the problem yet.

The main issue is about a Western blot and a fluorescent microscopy result. So the experiment setup: they used a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two coding regions, so the ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is upstream of an IRES element. Between the ligand and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and eGFP, a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. 

Wait, I remember that loxP sites are recognition sites for Cre recombinase, which causes recombination. So, the stop cassettes are probably to prevent expression of the fluorescent proteins until Cre is present. So, when Cre is introduced, it would delete the stop cassettes, allowing expression of the fluorescent tags.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and used them in a Western blot. The blot showed signals proportional to actin, meaning the loading was correct. Now, the mice are homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They cross them with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development. So the Cre would be active in neural crest cells, I think.

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal. They don't see a green signal. The green signal would come from the eGFP, which is attached to the receptor. So the eGFP isn't being expressed, or the construct isn't working.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But how does that affect expression in the Western blot or fluorescence? If they're expressed, the antibodies would detect them regardless. Also, the question is about why eGFP isn't showing up, not about the signaling relationship. So I'm not sure if this is the right choice.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. The Golgi apparatus is where proteins are modified and sent to their destinations. If stuck, the GFP wouldn't reach the cell surface, so wouldn't fluoresce. But why would that happen? Maybe a problem with trafficking. But the question is about the expression construct, so perhaps a frame issue or expression problem.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. Wait, the vectors have their own promoters. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is after an IRES, which is a internal ribosome entry site. IRES allows for translation without a strong promoter. But if the enhancer is missing, maybe the expression is low or not happening. But the Western blot showed signals, so the proteins were expressed. So the enhancer's absence may not explain the lack of GFP, unless the antibodies detected the proteins but the GFP wasn't expressed. But the question is about why eGFP isn't visible. So perhaps the problem is that the receptor-eGFP wasn't expressed, but the ligand-mCherry was.

Wait, but the Western blot—did they test for both proteins? The question states that the antibodies were against the overexpressed proteins. So if both were expressed, the blot would show signals for both. But the GFP is on the receptor, so if the receptor isn't expressed, then no eGFP. But in the Western, they saw a signal proportional to actin, which probably means the blot controls are correct. So maybe the problem is with the expression constructs.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Oh, wait, the construct: the Receptor ORF is fused to eGFP. If the fusion is not in frame, the eGFP won't be properly expressed. So the stop codon after the Receptor would prevent eGFP expression. But wait, the vector has a stop in a lox2272 cassette. So when Cre is introduced, it deletes the stop, allowing eGFP to be expressed. So if the frame is off, the eGFP might not be properly translated, leading to no green signal.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic. Ligand is first, with loxP-stop in between, so without Cre, the ligand is expressed (under CBA) and the stop prevents mCherry from being expressed. Receptor is followed by IRES, then the stop with lox2272. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact setup.

The vector has: Ligand ORF (with CBA promoter) → loxP-stop-loxP → mCherry; then, after the IRES, the Receptor ORF → lox2272-stop-lox2272 → eGFP.

Wait, no. The vector is a bicistronic construct with two cassettes. The first cassette is ligand under CBA, followed by stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP). The second cassette is the receptor under IRES, followed by another stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272).

Wait, maybe the vector is arranged as [Ligand] followed by stop, then mCherry, and then IRES, then receptor, then stop, then eGFP. Or perhaps it's in two separate cassettes, each with their own stop and loxP sites.

When Cre is introduced, it deletes the stop cassettes. So for the ligand, the stop is flanked by loxP sites. Cre would delete that, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed together. Similarly, the receptor and eGFP would be co-expressed because the stop in their cassette is between them, and Cre deletes it.

But in the experiment, the mouse construct is homozygous, and they crossed with SOX10-Cre. So Cre is expressed in neural crest cells. Therefore, in those cells, the stop cassettes should be deleted, leading to expression of ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP.

But in the fluorescence, there's no green. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

Possible reasons: Either the receptor-eGFP fusion isn't made (maybe frame shift, causing a stop codon), or the stop cassette wasn't properly deleted.

Wait, but the Western blot shows signals for the proteins. So the antibodies detected the ligand and receptor, meaning they were expressed. So the problem isn't with the expression of the proteins themselves but perhaps with the GFP.

But wait, the eGFP is only expressed if the stop cassette is removed. If the frame is wrong, the eGFP might not be expressed. Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is not functional, or the expression of the receptor-eGFP is not happening.

Wait, the vector's second ORF (receptor) is after the IRES. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so it can drive translation of the second ORF without a strong promoter. So, perhaps the IRES is not working, so the receptor isn't being expressed, but the ligand is. But the Western blot shows both proteins, since the antibodies are against both.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being correctly translated because the frame is wrong. So when Cre deletes the stop, the receptor and eGFP are in frame? Let me think: the receptor ORF is followed by the stop in a lox2272 cassette, then eGFP. So when Cre deletes the stop, the receptor is fused to eGFP. If the frames don't align, the eGFP won't be made correctly.

So the correct setup would require that the stop is deleted and the coding sequence of receptor and eGFP are in frame. If they're not in frame, the eGFP won't be expressed. So the Western blot would show the receptor (since the antibody is against it), but the eGFP won't fluoresce. Because the eGFP wasn't correctly made, the GFP won't show up.

So looking at the options: option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would explain why the GFP isn't fluorescent, but the receptor is expressed (so the Western blot shows it).

Alternatively, option C says the enhancer is missing. But the ligand is under a strong promoter (CBA), which should drive expression regardless of enhancers, but perhaps the receptor relies on an enhancer. However, the IRES is supposed to drive expression without a strong promoter. So if the enhancer is missing, the receptor might not be expressed. But the Western blot detected the receptor, suggesting it is expressed. So the enhancer issue might not be the problem.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. Well, if the protein is made and processed, it should appear at the cell surface. But if the construct is misfolded, maybe it's stuck. But the Western blot would show the protein regardless. So if the Western blot shows the receptor, but the GFP isn't, perhaps the issue is with the GFP part.

So the most likely reason is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, so the eGFP isn't expressed, but the receptor is, so the antibody detects it. Hence, no green signal in fluorescence.

The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair, with the ligand fused to mCherry and the receptor fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is positioned after an IRES element. Stop cassettes flanked by loxP and lox2272 sites prevent expression of the fluorescent proteins until Cre recombinase deletes these stops. The experiment involves crossing mice homozygous for this construct with SOX10-Cre mice, where Cre is expressed in neural crest cells. Despite successful Western blot detection of both proteins, no green signal from eGFP is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** A paracrine relationship between the ligand and receptor refers to their signaling function but does not explain the lack of eGFP fluorescence. The issue lies in the expression construct, not the signaling relationship. This option is unlikely.
  
- **Option B:** If the receptor-eGFP construct were stuck in the Golgi, eGFP would not reach the cell surface and fluoresce. However, the Western blot detected the receptor, indicating proper expression. This suggests the issue is not due to trafficking but rather expression of eGFP itself. This option is unlikely.

- **Option C:** The absence of an enhancer for ligand and receptor expression could reduce protein levels. However, the ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, and the receptor is driven by an IRES, which should allow expression without a strong promoter. The Western blot confirmed both proteins were expressed, making this option unlikely.

- **Option D:** If the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, the eGFP would not be properly translated, even if the stop cassette is deleted. This would result in no green signal under confocal microscopy, while the receptor would still be expressed and detected by the Western blot. This explanation aligns with the observed results and is the most likely reason.

### Conclusion:
The absence of a green signal is best explained by the receptor and eGFP not being in frame, preventing proper translation of eGFP.
