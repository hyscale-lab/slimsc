Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. Let's see.

The reaction given is Pi(+) at rest decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are provided: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle decays, energy and momentum must be conserved.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have such a tiny (almost zero) rest mass. So, in this case, the neutrino's mass can probably be neglected. That might simplify things a bit.

So, since the Pi(+) is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. After decay, the mu and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. But since the neutrino's mass is negligible, its kinetic energy would be much higher, I think.

Let me recall the conservation laws. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the Pi(+), which is its rest mass times c squared. But since we're working in units where c=1, it's just 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the mu and the neutrino. The mu has rest mass 105.7 MeV, so its energy will be gamma*m_mu*c², but since c=1, it's gamma*105.7. Similarly, the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy because its rest mass is negligible.

Wait, but mu's kinetic energy is (gamma -1)*m_mu. So the total energy after decay is (gamma -1)*m_mu + m_mu + E_nu. Hmm, not sure if that's the right way to approach it.

Wait, another approach: energy and momentum conservation. Since the pi is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So the momenta of the mu and nu must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me denote the mu's momentum as p. Then the neutrino's momentum is -p. But neutrino's mass is negligible, so E_nu ≈ p*c (since E² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2, and m is nearly zero). So E_nu ≈ |p| * c.

But in this problem, we're using units where c=1, so E_nu = |p|.

For the muon, E_mu = sqrt(p² c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4) / c^2. Since c=1, E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu^2). 

So the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p² + m_mu^2) + p.

But the total energy must equal the rest energy of the pi, which is m_pi c^2, so:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi.

Let me plug in the numbers. m_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV.

So, the equation is sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, this looks a bit tricky to solve for p. Let me call sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) as S. So S + p = m_pi.

But S = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2).

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root. Wait, but that might get messy. Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the equation.

Let me subtract p from both sides: S = m_pi - p.

Now square both sides:

p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (m_pi - p)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*p + p^2.

So, left side: p^2 + 105.7² = 139.6² - 279.2 p + p².

Subtract p² from both sides:

105.7² = 139.6² - 279.2 p.

Compute 139.6²: let's see, 140² is 19600, so 139.6² is (140 -0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = approximately 19488.16? Wait, but the exact value may matter. Alternatively, 139.6 *139.6.

Wait, exact calculation: 139*139 = 19321. Then 0.6^2=0.36. And cross terms: 2*(139)*(0.6)*2? Wait, no, binomial expansion for (a + b)^2 is a² + 2ab + b². So here, a=139 and b=0.6.

So (139 + 0.6)^2 = 139² + 2*139*0.6 + 0.6².

139²: let's compute 140²=19600, subtract 2*140 +1 (since (140-1)^2=140² -2*140 +1) → 19600 -280 +1=19321.

So 139.6² = (139 + 0.6)^2 = 19321 + 2*139*0.6 + 0.36.

2*139*0.6 = 278 *0.6 = 166.8.

So 19321 + 166.8 = 19487.8. Add 0.36 → 19488.16 MeV².

Similarly, 105.7² = (100 +5.7)^2 = 100² + 2*100*5.7 +5.7² = 10000 + 1140 +32.49 → 11172.49 MeV².

So plugging back into the equation:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 p.

Rearranging:

279.2 p = 19488.16 - 11172.49 → 19488.16 minus 11172.49 is let's see:

19488.16 - 11172.49 → 19488 - 11172 = 8316. 16 - 0.49 is 15.51. So 8316 +15.51 = 8331.51.

So p = 8331.51 / 279.2 ≈ Let me compute that.

Divide 8331.51 by 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 * 30 = 8376 → which is a bit higher than 8331.51.

So 279.2 * 29.8 = let's see. 279.2 * 30 = 8376 → subtract 279.2 * 0.2 → 55.84. So 8376 -55.84 = 8320.16. That's close to 8331.51.

The difference is 8331.51 -8320.16=11.35.

So 11.35 /279.2 ≈ 0.04058.

So p ≈ 29.8 + 0.04058 ≈ 29.84058 MeV/c.

Wait, so p is approximately 29.84 MeV/c.

Now, the neutrino's energy E_nu is approximately p*c. Since we're using c=1, E_nu ≈ p → about 29.84 MeV.

What about the muon's energy? E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) → sqrt( (29.84)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.84^2: 29.84 *29.84. Let's see, 30² is 900, but 29.84 is 0.16 less. So (30 -0.16)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.16 +0.16^2= 900 -9.6 +0.0256 = 890.4256.

105.7^2 is 11172.49 as before.

So E_mu = sqrt(890.4256 + 11172.49) → sqrt(12062.9156) → let's compute that.

What's sqrt(12062.9156)? Let's see, 110^2=12100, which is a bit higher. 109^2=11881.

So sqrt(12062.9156) is between 109 and 110.

Compute 109.8^2: 109^2=11881, 0.8^2=0.64, and 2*109*0.8=174.4 → 11881 + 174.4 +0.64= 12056.04.

Hmm, 12056.04 is just under 12062.9156. The difference is 6.8756.

So (109.8 + x)^2 = 12056.04 + 2*109.8 x + x² = 12062.9156.

Assume x is small, so x² can be neglected.

So 2*109.8 x ≈ 6.8756 → x≈6.8756/(2*109.8) → 6.8756/(219.6)≈0.0313.

So E_mu≈109.8 +0.0313≈109.8313 MeV.

So the muon's energy is approximately 109.83 MeV.

But wait, since the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, its kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu*c² → 109.83 -105.7 ≈4.13 MeV.

Wait, so the mu has KE ≈4.13 MeV, and the neutrino has KE≈29.84 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches closely.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes approximations can go wrong.

Hmm, p is about 29.84 MeV/c, so neutrino's KE is 29.84 MeV. Mu's KE is about 4.13 MeV. So option D is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculation of p.

Let me go back to the equation:

279.2 p = 19488.16 - 11172.49 → 19488.16-11172.49 = 8315.67.

Wait, 19488.16 minus 11172.49 is 19488.16-11172.49.

Let me compute that accurately.

19488.16
-11172.49
= ?

Subtracting:

19488.16
-11172.49
= (19488 -11172) + (0.16 -0.49)
= 8316 + (-0.33)
= 8315.67.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 times 29.8 is approximately 279.2 *30=8376 → subtract 0.2*279.2=55.84 → 8376-55.84=8320.16.

But 8320.16 is greater than 8315.67.

So 29.8 *279.2 =8320.16.

So 8315.67 is 8320.16 -4.49.

So p is 29.8 - (4.49 /279.2).

4.49 /279.2 ≈ 0.01608.

So p ≈29.8 -0.01608 =29.7839 MeV/c.

Wait, that's about 29.78 MeV/c.

So E_nu is p ≈29.78 MeV.

Then, for the muon's energy, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 )

p^2 = (29.78)^2 ≈887.0.

m_mu^2 = (105.7)^2 =11172.49.

So E_mu = sqrt(887.0 +11172.49) = sqrt(12059.49) ≈109.813 MeV.

So KE_mu is E_mu - m_mu =109.813-105.7=4.113 MeV.

Which is approximately 4.11 MeV.

So the mu's KE is about 4.11, and the neutrino's is about 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches.

So the correct answer should be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

**Reaction:**  
\[
\pi^+ \, (\text{at rest}) \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

Given:  
- Rest mass of \(\pi^+\): \(m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\)  
- Rest mass of \(\mu^+\): \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\)  
- Neutrino mass is negligible (\(m_{\nu} \approx 0\)).

### Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation:**  
   The total energy before decay is the rest energy of \(\pi^+\):  
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of \(\mu^+\) and \(\nu\):  
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation:**  
   Since \(\pi^+\) is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. Thus, the momenta of \(\mu^+\) and \(\nu\) are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:  
   \[
   |\vec{p}_{\mu}| = |\vec{p}_{\nu}| = p.
   \]

### Energy of \(\mu^+\) and \(\nu\)
- The energy of \(\mu^+\) is given by:  
  \[
  E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}.
  \]
- The energy of \(\nu\) is approximately equal to its momentum (since its rest mass is negligible):  
  \[
  E_{\nu} \approx p.
  \]

### Total Energy Equation
From energy conservation:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p = m_{\pi}.
\]  
Substituting \(m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\):  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + (105.7)^2} + p = 139.6.
\]

### Solving for \(p\)
1. Rearrange the equation:  
   \[
   \sqrt{p^2 + (105.7)^2} = 139.6 - p.
   \]
2. Square both sides:  
   \[
   p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
   \]
3. Expand and simplify:  
   \[
   p^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2p + p^2.
   \]
   Subtract \(p^2\) from both sides:  
   \[
   11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2p.
   \]
4. Solve for \(p\):  
   \[
   279.2p = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67,
   \]
   \[
   p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c.
   \]

### Energy of \(\mu^+\) and \(\nu\)
1. Neutrino energy:  
   \[
   E_{\nu} \approx p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
2. Muon energy:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
   \]
   Compute \((29.78)^2 = 887.0\) and \((105.7)^2 = 11172.49\):  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{887.0 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.49} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
3. Muon kinetic energy:  
   \[
   KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.81 - 105.7 \approx 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Results
- \(KE_{\mu} \approx 4.11 \, \text{MeV}\)  
- \(KE_{\nu} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}\).

### Matching with Options
The closest match is **Option D**: \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\).

**Answer: D**
