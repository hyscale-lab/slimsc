Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. It's about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think this through step by step.

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. A pure state would have a density matrix like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, but this one looks mixed because it's an average of two projectors.

Wait, so |0⟩⟨0| is a projector onto the state |0⟩, same with |1⟩⟨1|. So ρ is the average of these two. But what does that represent in terms of the Bloch sphere?

I remember that for a single qubit, any density matrix can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometrical way to represent qubit states, where pure states are on the surface and mixed states are inside. The representation uses the Pauli matrices. The general form of a density matrix is (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector and σ are the Pauli matrices.

Oh right! So the density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix, and r is a vector in 3D space (like (x, y, z)) that determines the position on the Bloch sphere. If r has length 1, it's a pure state; if less, it's mixed.

So, let me write down ρ again. It's (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me compute each term. |0⟩⟨0| is a diagonal matrix with 1s on the first diagonal element and 0s elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is diagonal with 1 on the second diagonal element. Adding them gives a diagonal matrix with 1s in both diagonal positions. When multiplied by 1/2, it becomes 0.5 in both diagonal positions and 0 elsewhere.

Wait, that's the same as (I)/2. Because I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so (I)/2 is [[0.5,0],[0,0.5]]. So ρ equals (I + 0·σ)/2, because when r is zero, the density matrix is just the identity scaled by 1/2.

Ah, so r must be (0,0,0). Because when r is zero, the density matrix is (I + 0)/2. Which matches ρ here.

Wait, but what's the significance of r=(0,0,0)? That would mean the state is completely mixed. Because a completely mixed state has maximum entropy and can't be distinguished from classical randomness. In the Bloch sphere, the origin corresponds to the completely mixed state, right? Because the density matrix would be (I/2), which is the maximally mixed state for a qubit.

So looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.

Let me double-check. The density matrix given in the question is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. That's the same as (I)/2. Comparing with the general form (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2, the r_x, r_y, r_z must all be zero. Hence, r is (0,0,0), which is option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. In the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is a vector in 3D space, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), it is evident that \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), as there are no additional terms involving the Pauli matrices. 

A density matrix with \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\) corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is represented by the origin in the Bloch sphere. Among the given options, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state, not a mixed state.  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a different mixed state.  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\):** Correct, as this corresponds to the completely mixed state.  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state, not a mixed state.  

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as the density matrix represents the completely mixed state, which is at the origin in the Bloch sphere.
