Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the decay of a boson. Let's see what the question says.

The problem gives a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as:

L(y) = -λf ψ_f̄ (y) (ν + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Wait, I think I misread that. Oh right, probably it's L(y) = -λ f ψ_f̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, but maybe the exact form isn't too crucial for determining the decay products. The key thing is that the boson X interacts with fermions.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. I need to find which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different fermion pairs.

So, kinematically allowed means the energy of the boson must be enough to produce the particles. Remember that for a decay X → f f̄, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion f. Because each fermion would take away some energy, and the rest would be kinetic.

Wait, but what fermions are we talking about here? The interaction is with all the fermions, right? Because in the Lagrangian, it's written as ψ_f, which I guess represents all possible fermions—like all the quarks and leptons.

So the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, as long as 2m_f ≤ m_X. Since m_X is 6 GeV, so the maximum mass of a fermion that can be produced is 3 GeV. Because each would need to be at least 3 GeV to sum up to 6 GeV. Wait, no, wait: 2m_f ≤ m_X. So m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

Wait, but what's the mass of each fermion? Let's think about the known fermion masses.

Leptons: electrons (m ~ 0.511 MeV), muons (~105.7 MeV), taus (~1.78 GeV). So tau is about 1.78 GeV, so 2m_tau is about 3.56 GeV. Oh wait, but X is 6 GeV. So tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2*1.78 = 3.56 GeV. So, yes, 6 GeV is more than 3.56 GeV, so X can decay into tau and tau anti.

Wait wait wait, no, wait. X has mass 6 GeV. So for a fermion pair, each must be less than or equal to 3 GeV. Because 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤3 GeV.

So let's list all the fermions with mass ≤3 GeV.

Quarks: let's remember their masses. Well, current quarks have masses. The masses are a bit tricky because they're given in different schemes, but approximately:

Up and down: around a few MeV each. So 2m_u ~ 2*2 MeV = 4 MeV << 6 GeV. So X can decay into u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄... wait, but what about the charm quark? Its mass is about 1.5 GeV. So 2m_c is about 3 GeV. So X can decay into c c̄ as 3 GeV is exactly 6 GeV? Wait, 2m_c = 3 GeV, so m_X =6 GeV is more than that. So yes, decay into c c̄ is allowed.

Wait, but wait, what about bottom quarks? The bottom quark has a much higher mass, around 4.5 GeV. So 2m_b is around 9 GeV, which is more than X's 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b b̄ because it doesn't have enough energy. So X can't decay into b quarks. So any option that includes b quarks is out.

So looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau tau, e+ e−.

But since X can't decay into b b̄, option A is incorrect.

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau tau, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

Wait, does this include c c̄? Yes. So c quark has m ~1.5 GeV, so 2m ~3 GeV. X is 6 GeV, so that's okay. What about the others?

s quark: mass about 95 MeV. So 2m is 190 MeV, way less than 6 GeV.

u quark: 2m ~4 MeV.

d quark: similar to u.

Tau: m ~1.78 GeV. 2m ~3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV, so allowed.

For leptons: mu is ~105 MeV, 2m ~210 MeV. e is negligible. So all these are allowed.

So option B includes c c̄, which is allowed, but wait, the top option says c c̄, but what about for the quarks, is the interaction allowed with all the quarks?

Wait, the problem statement says the interaction is with fermions, but the Lagrangian seems to be written as involving a Yukawa coupling, perhaps? The Lagrangian is L = -λ f ψ_f̄ (v + X) ψ_f. So for each fermion f, the coupling is present, so X can interact with any fermion.

So the possible decay products are all possible f f̄ pairs where 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So looking back, which fermions have m_f ≤3 GeV? Let me list them.

Leptons:

- e: 0.511 MeV → yes.

- mu: ~105.7 MeV → yes.

- tau: ~1.78 GeV → yes, since 1.78 <3 GeV.

Quarks:

- u: ~2 MeV → yes.

- d: ~5 MeV → yes.

- s: ~95 MeV → yes.

- c: ~1.5 GeV → yes.

- b: ~4.5 GeV → no, as 4.5 >3 GeV.

- t: way higher, about 173 GeV → no.

So the possible quarks are u, d, s, c.

Wait, but wait, what about the top quark? No, because its mass is way higher than 3 GeV. So in decay, X can't produce t t̄.

So the decay products possible are pairs of u, d, s, c, and the leptons e, mu, tau.

So when looking at the options, which one includes only these?

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau tau, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

Yes, that includes all the possible fermions with m_f ≤3 GeV.

Option D: includes b b̄, which is not allowed. So D is wrong.

Option C includes t t̄, which is way too heavy, so C is incorrect.

So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option B says c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau tau, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

Yes, all are allowed. So the correct answer should be B.

But wait, wait a second. Let me check the option B again. It says X can decay into c c̄, but the mass of c is 1.5 GeV, so 2m_c is 3 GeV, which is less than m_X=6 GeV. So yes, it's allowed.

So the allowed decay channels are any f f̄ where m_f ≤3 GeV. So for the options, option B includes all these possibilities except b and t, which can't be decay products.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction term in the Lagrangian indicates that \( X \) can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair \( f \bar{f} \), provided the mass of \( X \) is sufficient to account for the combined rest mass of the fermion and antifermion. This requires \( 2m_f \leq m_X \), or equivalently \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 1: Fermion Masses
The masses of known fermions are as follows:
- **Leptons**:
  - Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \approx 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \)
  - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \approx 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
  - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Quarks**:
  - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV} \)
  - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 5 \, \text{MeV} \)
  - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 95 \, \text{MeV} \)
  - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
  - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
  - Top (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

From these masses, only fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are kinematically allowed for the decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \). This includes:
- Leptons: \( e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^- \)
- Quarks: \( u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c} \)

### Step 2: Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: \( X \to b \bar{b}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, e^+ e^- \)  
  This includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.

- **Option B**: \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \)  
  This includes all allowed fermion pairs (\( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \)) and excludes \( b \bar{b} \) and \( t \bar{t} \), which are too heavy. This option is correct.

- **Option C**: \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, t \bar{t}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \)  
  This includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.

- **Option D**: \( X \to b \bar{b}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \)  
  This includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.

### Final Answer
The correct option is **B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV.

Answer: B
