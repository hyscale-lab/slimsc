Okay, so I've got this question about the Lagrangian in quantum field theory, and I'm supposed to find the mass dimension of κ and determine whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, σ matrices are related to the generators of Lorentz transformations or something like that. 

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. Remember, in QFT, each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ=c=1). So the entire Lagrangian term should have [L] = 4.

Let's break down each part. The fields ψ and ψ̄ are Dirac spinors. I think each Dirac spinor has mass dimension 3/2. Because in 4D spacetime, a spinor field ψ has dimension (4-1)/2 = 3/2. So ψ̄ would also be 3/2.

Next, σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices. Each γ matrix is dimensionless because they're just matrices, right? So σ_{μν} has the same mass dimension as the commutator, which would be the same as two γ matrices. So [σ_{μν}] = 0.

Then, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism or something similar. Wait, F is antisymmetric and has dimensions of mass squared. Because F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, and A is a vector potential, which has dimension 1. So each derivative ∂ is mass dimension 1, so F has [F^{μν}] = 2.

Putting it all together: L_int is κ times ψ̄ times σ_{μν} times ψ times F^{μν}.

The dimensions would be:
[κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = [κ] + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2.

Adding those up: [κ] + 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = [κ] + 3 + 2 = [κ] +5.

But the entire term has to have mass dimension 4, so [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1. So κ has mass dimension -1.

Wait, that seems right. So the first part of the question is [κ]_M = -1. So looking at the options, A and C have this. 

Now, the second part—whether the theory is renormalizable. Renormalizability depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constant. In renormalizable theories, the coupling has a mass dimension ≤ 0. Wait, no, wait: Let me get this right. For a theory to be renormalizable, the dimension of the coupling [g] must satisfy [g] ≥ (4-d)/2, but I might be mixing up the exact condition.

Wait, in 4 dimensions, the mass dimension of the coupling in an interaction term of the form g φ^n must be [g] = d - (n-1)*m, where m is the mass dimension of the field φ. Wait, perhaps it's better to remember that each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, and each field in the term has their own dimension. Any term where the coupling has positive mass dimension is nonrenormalizable because it introduces higher-order terms in perturbation theory, which are not manageable (i.e., you need to include an infinite number of counterterms).

Wait, but wait. The dimension of the coupling tells us. If [κ] is negative, that suggests that the term is relevant or irrelevant. Wait, no—actually, the mass dimension of the coupling is important for renormalization. Let me think again.

In a renormalizable theory, the coupling constants have a mass dimension such that the interaction terms are of renormalizable type. For a term like ψ̄ σ F ψ, which is a four-fermion interaction, perhaps, but in this case, it's a two-fermion and F term.

Wait, no, wait: Let me see. The term is quadratic in ψ? Because ψ̄ σ ψ is a scalar, but then multiplied by F. So the term is like (ψ̄ σ ψ) F. Wait, but F is a field strength tensor, which is like ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so F has two derivatives, so dimension 2.

Wait, but in terms of renormalizability, the interaction term's dimension is given by the sum of the fields and coupling.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the type of interaction. The term given is a Lorentz vector current (since σ_{μν} is a Lorentz tensor) multiplied by F^{μν}, which is the field strength tensor of electromagnetism. So this looks like a term in the interaction Lagrangian for a fermionic current coupling to a gauge field. But wait, more accurately, in QED, the interaction is e ψ̄ γ^μ ψ A_μ. So that's a term with e as the coupling, dimension 1, since [e] = [ψ̄ γ ψ A] → [e] must be 1 because [ψ] is 3/2, so [ψ̄ γ ψ] is 3, and [A] is 1; so 3 +1 =4, so e must be dimensionless? Wait, no, wait: [e ψ̄ γ ψ A] must be 4. [ψ̄ γ ψ] is (3/2)*2 =3. [A] is 1 (since A is a vector, each component has dimension 1). So [e] must be 4 - (3+1) )=0. So e is dimensionless. So in QED, the coupling is dimensionless.

In our case, the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. Let's compute the dimension of the product ψ̄ σ ψ F.

[ψ̄] is 3/2, [σ] is 0, [ψ] is 3/2, so [ψ̄ σ ψ] is 3. Then [F] is 2. So the product is 3+2=5. The entire term is κ multiplied by this product, so the term's dimension is [κ] +5. Since the term must be dimension 4, [κ] is -1, as I found earlier.

Now, for renormalizability: The interaction term is a part of the Lagrangian, and all terms must have dimension 4. So the question is about the dimension of κ. Since the dimension is negative, that would suggest that the term is nonrenormalizable. Because, in renormalizable theories, the coupling has a mass dimension ≥ 0. Wait, no. Wait, wait.

Wait, let's think about the general rule. For a term in the Lagrangian like g φ^n, the dimension is [g] + n [φ] =4. So [g] =4 - n [φ].

In four dimensions, a scalar field φ has dimension 1. So for φ^4 interaction, [g] =4 -4*(1)=0, which is renormalizable. For a φ^3 term, [g] =4 -3*(1)=1, which is superrenormalizable. For a φ^5 term, [g] =4-5= -1, which is nonrenormalizable.

So, in our case, the term is like κ (ψ̄ σ ψ) F. Let's consider the structure. Let's think of (ψ̄ σ ψ) as a scalar, say S, and F as another scalar field T. Then the term is κ S T. So the product S T has [S] =3 (since ψ has 3/2 each, and two ψs plus the σ), and [T]=2. So [S T]=5. So, [κ] must be -1.

In terms of the dimension of the coupling κ, which is -1, this is a negative dimension. Now, when the coupling has a negative mass dimension, the interaction term is nonrenormalizable. Because in renormalizable theories, the coupling's dimension must be ≥0. So since [κ]=-1 <0, the theory is nonrenormalizable.

Wait, but wait. Another way to think about it: the interaction term has a higher dimension. So the term is of higher order in terms of mass dimension. So it would require an infinite number of counterterms, making the theory nonrenormalizable.

So, putting it together: κ has [κ]_M =-1, the theory is not renormalizable.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: [κ]=-1, renormalizable. No, because we said it's not renormalizable.

Option C: [κ]=-1, not renormalizable. That's correct.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
In quantum field theory, the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 to ensure the action is dimensionless. Breaking down the dimensions of each term:
- The Dirac spinor fields $\bar{\psi}$ and $\psi$ each have mass dimension $\frac{3}{2}$.
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ tensor is a commutator of $\gamma$-matrices, which are dimensionless, so $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension 2, as it is constructed from derivatives of the gauge field $A_\mu$ (which has dimension 1).

The interaction term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must therefore satisfy:
\[
[\kappa] + [\bar{\psi}] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = 4.
\]
Substituting the dimensions:
\[
[\kappa] + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. In this case, the coupling $\kappa$ has a mass dimension of $-1$, which is negative. This indicates that the interaction term is nonrenormalizable. Nonrenormalizable theories require an infinite number of counterterms to handle divergences, making them impractical for a complete quantum description.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
