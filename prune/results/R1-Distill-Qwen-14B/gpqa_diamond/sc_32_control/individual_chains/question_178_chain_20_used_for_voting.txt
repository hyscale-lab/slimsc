Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangian density and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think it through step by step. 

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which I remember is the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. And F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, probably from electromagnetism or something like that.

Wait, the question is about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Right, to find the mass dimension, I need to figure out the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian because in four spacetime dimensions, the Lagrangian has to be dimensionless (since the action is dimensionless).

Each term in the Lagrangian should have mass dimension 4 because when you integrate the Lagrangian density over spacetime, the integral is dimensionless. So the whole expression for L_int must have mass dimension 4.

Let me break down the components:

First, ψ is a Dirac spinor. In four dimensions, a Dirac spinor has mass dimension 3/2. Because each component of ψ has dimension 3/2, right? So ψ̄ would also be 3/2.

Next, σ_{μν} is made from gamma matrices. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, I think, because they're just matrices. So [γ_μ] = 0. Since σ is a commutator of gammas, it's dimensionless too. So each σ_{μν} has dimension 0.

Then, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ plus some terms for the field A. The A field (like a gauge field) typically has mass dimension 1 in four dimensions. Because the field strength tensor involves derivatives of A, so each derivative contributes mass dimension 1. So F^{μν} would have dimension 2. Because ∂_μ A_ν has dimension [∂][A] = 1 + 1 = 2.

Putting it all together, the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν} would have dimensions equal to the sum of the dimensions of each component. 

Let me calculate each part:

ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, σ is 0, ψ is 3/2, and F is 2. So adding them up: 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = 3/2 +3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. Wait, but the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So the remaining part, which is κ, must adjust that. Because the entire term is κ multiplied by that, so the dimension of κ plus the dimensions of the rest equals 4.

So [κ] + 5 = 4 → [κ] = 4 -5 = -1. So the mass dimension of κ is -1. That would point me towards options A or C.

Now, whether the theory is renormalizable. Renormalizability depends on the operators having mass dimension less than or equal to 4 (since in four dimensions, operators with dimension ≤4 are renormalizable). Wait, the interaction term is part of the Lagrangian, which must have dimension 4. So each term in the interaction should have dimension 4.

Wait, the term is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. The dimension of this term is [κ] + 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = [κ] + 5 = 4. Which we already solved as [κ]=-1.

But to check renormalizability, I think we look at the dimension of the coupling constant. Wait, the mass dimension of the coupling constant determines the renormalizability. If the dimension is [κ] = -1, then the interaction term is dimension 4. Wait, no, because the term has dimension 4, and the coupling is part of that.

Wait, another approach: In four dimensions, a renormalizable interaction has a coupling with mass dimension ≤0. Because the general rule is that the dimension of the coupling is 4 - (sum of fields in the term). Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the superficial degree of divergence.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the power counting for renormalizability. The interaction term is L = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. Let's compute the mass dimension of this term. Each ψ is 3/2, F is 2, σ is 0, and κ is -1. So the term has dimension: 3/2 +3/2 +2 + (-1) = 3 +2 -1 =4. So that's good.

But to see if the interaction is renormalizable, I think the coupling must have a dimension such that when you consider the Feynman diagrams, the integrals don't lead to divergences beyond what can be absorbed by the existing terms in the Lagrangian.

Wait, more accurately, the theory is renormalizable if the coupling constant has a dimension greater than or equal to (4 - n), where n is the number of fields in the interaction term. Or perhaps another way: the dimension of the coupling constant [κ] must be ≥ 0 for renormalizability. Or was it ≤ ?

Wait, wait. The general rule is that the coupling constants in renormalizable theories have mass dimension ≤ (D - (sum of fields)/2), where D is the spacetime dimension. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, in four dimensions (D=4), the coupling in a term like g ψ ψ ψ would have to have [g] = mass^ (4 - 3*(3/2)) )? Wait, because each ψ is 3/2, so three ψs sum to 9/2. So 4 - 9/2 = -1/2. So [g] must be -1/2. But that's for a three-fermion interaction. Hmm.

Wait, in our case, the term is κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. Let's see, ψ̄ is 3/2, ψ is 3/2, F is 2. So summing up, the fields contribute 3/2 +3/2 +2 = 5. The term must have dimension 4, so [κ] = 4 -5 = -1.

Now, for a theory to be renormalizable, all the coupling constants in the interactions must have mass dimension ≥ 0. Because in the perturbative expansion, the coupling's dimension determines the superficial degree of divergence of Feynman diagrams. If the coupling has a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable because loop integrals would diverge more severely than can be absorbed by the existing terms.

So [κ]=-1 is negative, which suggests the theory is not renormalizable. Because the coupling has a negative dimension, which implies that the interaction becomes stronger at higher energies (since the coupling grows with energy), leading to non-renormalizable interactions. Thus, the theory would not be renormalizable.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The mass dimension of the coupling is [κ] = -1. Since in four dimensions, for a renormalizable theory, the coupling should have [κ] ≥ 0. Because when [κ] is negative, the interaction term has higher dimension, leading to a non-renormalizable theory.

So in this case, [κ]=-1 <0, so the theory is not renormalizable. That would mean the answer is either C or D.

Looking back at the options:

A) [κ]=-1, renormalizable. → No, because [κ] is -1, which is not allowed for renormalizable.

B) [κ]=1, renormalizable. → No, but we found κ is -1.

C) [κ]=-1, not renormalizable. → This matches.

D) [κ]=1, not ren... → No, because we have [κ]=-1.

So the correct answer would be option C.

To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of the Lagrangian
In four spacetime dimensions, the Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}$ must have mass dimension 4 to ensure the action is dimensionless. The term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ contributes to $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$, so its total dimension must also be 4.

### Step 2: Mass dimensions of the components
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $\frac{3}{2}$ in four dimensions. Thus, $\bar{\psi}$ also has dimension $\frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension 2, as it involves derivatives of the gauge field $A_\mu$, which has dimension 1.
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ term is constructed from the commutator of dimensionless gamma matrices $\gamma_\mu$, so it has mass dimension 0.

### Step 3: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The total mass dimension of the term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ is:
\[
\left[\bar{\psi}\right] + \left[\sigma_{\mu\nu}\right] + \left[\psi\right] + \left[F^{\mu\nu}\right] = \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must satisfy:
\[
\left[\kappa\right] + 5 = 4 \implies \left[\kappa\right] = -1.
\]

### Step 4: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have mass dimension $\geq 0$. In this case, $\kappa$ has mass dimension $-1$, which is negative. This implies the theory is not renormalizable because the interaction term has a dimension higher than 4, leading to divergences that cannot be absorbed by the existing terms in the Lagrangian.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option **C**.
