Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. And the options are the possible number of organic products formed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, and when it's used in a condensed ammonia solvent, it's often involved in dehydrohalogenation reactions, especially for aromatic compounds. Oh wait, right! It's typically used for eliminating halides to form alkenes via E2 mechanisms. But wait, wait, benzene rings with substituents can undergo different reactions. Let me think about the structure here.

The compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, the 'd' probably stands for a deuterium? Oh, right, benzene-2-d would have a deuterium in the ortho position relative to the bromine. Because benzene is a ring, so positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So the structure is bromine in position 1 and deuterium in position 2. Or wait, maybe the numbering is different. Oh wait, in benzene, positions are numbered in a way that substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So 1 and 2 are adjacent, so bromine and deuterium are on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the deuterium is in position para to the bromine? No, no, because it's 1-bromo and 2-d, so position 2 is adjacent to 1. So, the ring has Br in position 1 and D (deuterium) in position 2. So the molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene.

Now, when we treat this with NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a strong base. So, the base will abstract a proton, but wait, the solvent is NH3 (l) which is a good solvent for elimination reactions. So, dehydrohalogenation is likely here.

Wait, but the compound is an aromatic ring with Br and D adjacent. So, the reaction is probably an elimination reaction. But wait, benzene is already a stable ring, so how does elimination work here? Oh, wait a second. I think this is about forming a benzyne intermediate. Because when you have two substituents on adjacent positions, a strong base can abstract a proton (or deuterium?), leading to the formation of a triple bond, like a benzyne.

Wait, but the substituent here is Br and D. So when Br leaves, the adjacent D may be abstracted as a proton, but wait, D is not a proton, it's deuterium. So, if we have a Br and D in adjacent positions, the base (like NaNH2) will abstract a proton from a position adjacent to Br, but wait, the D is already in position 2. So perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, leading to the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, with the Br leaving.

Wait, let me think. The molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So positions 1 has Br, 2 has D. The adjacent hydrogens are in position 3. So if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, that would cause elimination of Br– and form a triple bond between 1 and 2, creating a benzyne (aryne) intermediate. Alternatively, if the D is in position 2, perhaps the base can abstract a hydrogen from position 3 or position 6, but wait, position 6 is meta to Br, so maybe only position 3 is adjacent.

Wait, benzene is a ring, so position 1 is where Br is, position 2 is D, positions 3 and 6 are adjacent to position 2, position 4 is across from position 1, etc. So when the base abstracts a proton from position 3, that's adjacent to the Br in position 1. So the elimination would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, but wait, the D is in position 2. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally. Let's imagine the benzene ring:

- Position 1: Br
- Position 2: D
- Positions 3 and 6: H
- Positions 4,5: other H's.

Wait, but if I abstract a hydrogen from position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (where D is), but also adjacent to position 2. Oh wait, position 3 is adjacent to position 2 and position 4 (but that's across from position 1). Hmm, maybe the abstracted H is from position 3, so the elimination would occur between positions 1 and 2, but position 2 has D, not H. Wait, but D is a hydrogen isotope, so perhaps it's a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. But NaNH2 is a strong base, more likely to cause elimination, especially in aromatic systems where elimination can form a triple bond (aryne).

Wait, another thought: maybe the D is not in position 2 but elsewhere. Wait, 1-bromo-2-d benzene would have Br at position 1, D at position 2. So the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Wait, if the base abstracts a H from position 3, which is adjacent to position 2, that would lead to the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, but position 2 has D, not H. Hmm, perhaps that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the D is not going to be abstracted because it's a deuterium. So the H's in position 3 and 6 are the ones that can be abstracted. So, the base (NaNH2) would abstract either the H from position 3 or position 6. Each would lead to a different aryne structure. Wait, but position 3 is adjacent to position 2, which has D, so perhaps the Hs in position 3 and 6 are both available.

Wait, but if the H is abstracted from position 3, then the Br in position 1 and the H in position 3 are on adjacent carbons (positions 1 and 3 are meta, actually. Wait, wait, no. In benzene, each carbon is attached to two adjacent carbons. So position 1's adjacent are 2 and 6. Position 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. So the H in position 3 is adjacent to position 2, which has the D.

Wait, perhaps when the base abstracts a H from position 3, elimination occurs between position 1 (Br) and position 2 (D). But wait, elimination forms a double bond, but in aromatic systems, that's a triple bond, right? Wait, no, in benzene, elimination leads to a triple bond, making the aryne. So, the Br leaves along with the H from position 3, forming a triple bond between 1 and 2. But wait, position 2 has a D, not H. So maybe that's not possible.

Hmm, perhaps the D is in position 2, so the base can't abstract a H from position 3 because position 3's H is next to D in position 2. Wait, but that doesn't necessarily prevent the base from abstracting it. Because the positions are different. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to substitution. But NaNH2 is a strong base, so substitution is less likely unless it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which usually requires activating groups. But Br is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the ring. So substitution might not be favored.

Wait, but if elimination is possible, then we can form a benzyne. Let me think about the possibilities. When the benzene ring has Br and D in adjacent positions, and the base abstracts an H from position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (D), then the Br (position 1) and the H (position 3) are two apart. Oh wait, because positions 1 and 3 are meta to each other on the benzene ring. So for elimination between 1 and 3, that would require the H to be on a carbon adjacent to the Br's carbon. Oh, wait, position 1's adjacent carbons are 2 and 6. So, if the H is abstracted from position 6, that's adjacent to position 1. So, if the base abstracts the H from position 6, which is adjacent to Br in position 1, then elimination occurs between positions 1 and 6. But wait, position 6 is adjacent to position 1.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the numbering. Let me renumber the benzene ring with Br in position 1. Then positions go 1 (Br), 2 (D), 3, 4, 5, 6. So, position 6 is adjacent to position 1. So if the base abstracts the H from position 6, that's adjacent to Br in position 1. So elimination would occur between positions 1 and 6, forming a triple bond between them, leading to a 1,2-dideutero benzene with a triple bond between 1 and 6? Wait, no, because the triple bond would form between the two adjacent carbons where elimination happened.

Wait, no. Elimination typically forms a double bond, but in aromatic systems, it forms a triple bond (aryne). So, between position 1 and 2, or 1 and 6, depending on where the H is abstracted. Wait, but position 6 has a H, right? So, if the base abstracts the H from position 6, which is adjacent to Br in position 1, then the Br leaves, and the H is abstracted, leading to a triple bond between position 1 and 6.

But position 2 has D. So, would that affect anything? Hmm.

Wait, but the original structure is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So, if the base abstracts a H from position 6, which is adjacent to Br in position 1, then elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 6. But wait, position 6 is adjacent to position 5 and 1. So, the triple bond would be between 1 and 6, making a benzyne. But then the D is in position 2. So, the triple bond would be at positions 1 and 6, and the D is at position 2. Hmm.

Wait, but the question is about the number of possible organic products. So, if the elimination occurs, how many different products could form?

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a H from position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (D). But position 3 is not adjacent to position 1 (Br), so elimination can't occur from position 1 and 3. So, the only possibility is abstraction from position 6, which is adjacent to position 1.

Wait, but in that case, the elimination would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 6, leading to a benzene ring with triple bond between 1 and 6, and the D remains in position 2. So, how many such products are possible?

Wait, perhaps the deuterium's position doesn't affect the number of products, because the triple bond can form in more than one position. Alternatively, perhaps the D is in position 2, which is adjacent to position 1 where Br is, so the only possible elimination is between positions 1 and 2.

Wait, but position 2 has D, which isn't a hydrogen. So, the base can't abstract a proton from position 2. Therefore, the only possible H to abstract is from position 3 or 6, but only if they're adjacent to Br's position.

Wait, position 6 is adjacent to position 1, so the H there can be abstracted, leading to elimination between 1 and 6. Similarly, position 3 is adjacent to position 2, but position 2 has D, and position 3's H is two away from the Br in position 1. Wait, position 3 is not adjacent to position 1. So, the only possible elimination is between position 1 and 6, forming a triple bond there.

So, the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 6, and a D in position 2. But wait, would that D affect the possibility of forming multiple products?

Alternatively, perhaps the D is in position 2, which is adjacent to position 1. So, if the base abstracts a H from position 3, which is adjacent to position 2, but position 3 is not adjacent to position 1, so elimination can't happen between 1 and 3. Similarly, position 6 is adjacent to position 1, so the H there can be abstracted, leading to elimination between 1 and 6.

Wait, but the benzyne could form in two different positions, depending on which H is abstracted. Or does the presence of the D in position 2 restrict that?

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible products. If the reaction is elimination to form a benzyne, how many unique products can form?

In benzene rings, if you have a substituent in position 1, the possible elimination positions are 1-2, 1-3, etc., but in reality, elimination occurs between adjacent positions. Wait, no, elimination in aromatic systems typically occurs between adjacent positions to form a triple bond, which requires the leaving groups to be on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but in this case, the Br is in position 1, and the D is in position 2. So, the Br is on position 1, and the adjacent position (2) has D. So, to form a triple bond, you need to eliminate Br and a H from position 2, but position 2 has D, not H. So, perhaps elimination isn't possible between 1 and 2.

Wait, that's a key point. If the Br is in position 1 and the adjacent position (2) has D, then the H that can be abstracted is from position 6, which is adjacent to position 1, or perhaps position 3, which is adjacent to position 2.

Wait, but position 3 is adjacent to position 2, which has D. So, if the base abstracts H from position 3, which is adjacent to D in position 2, but position 3 is not adjacent to Br in position 1. So elimination between 1 and 3 isn't possible because they're not adjacent.

So, the only possible elimination is from position 6, adjacent to position 1. So, the base abstracts H from position 6, Br leaves, forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. So, the product is a benzene ring with a triple bond between 1 and 6 and a D in position 2.

Wait, but that would be a single product. So, the answer would be B) 1.

But wait, another possibility: maybe the D is in position 2, but when the triple bond forms between positions 1 and 6, the ring's structure changes. But since the D is in position 2, which is adjacent to position 1, does that affect the number of possible products?

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination can occur in two different ways, leading to different structures. Wait, but in this case, the elimination is only possible in one way because the D is in position 2, blocking the other possibility.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about deuterium's effect. Deuterium is a heavier isotope, but in reactions, it can sometimes affect reaction rates. But in this case, the presence of D in position 2 doesn't directly interfere with the elimination between position 1 and 6. So, the product would be a single structure: deuterium in position 2, triple bond between 1 and 6, and the rest of the ring being H's.

But wait, could there be another product? Like, maybe the D could end up in a different position after elimination? Or perhaps the triple bond can form in more than one position?

Wait, another thought: if the D is in position 2, when the triple bond forms between 1 and 6, the ring's symmetry might lead to different products. Or maybe not, because the D is fixed in position 2. So, only one product is possible.

So, the answer would be option B) 1.

Wait, but another angle: sometimes, when you eliminate to form a triple bond, the aryne can undergo different reactions, such as [2+2] cycloadditions, but in this case, the question is about the products formed in the elimination step, not further reactions. So, the product is just the aryne.

So, only one product is formed.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base, commonly used for dehydrohalogenation reactions, particularly in aromatic systems to form benzyne (aryne) intermediates. The starting compound, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has bromine in position 1 and deuterium (D) in position 2 of the benzene ring.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d**:  
   - Bromine is at position 1, and deuterium is at position 2.  
   - Positions 3 and 6 are adjacent to position 2 (deuterium) and position 1 (bromine), respectively.

2. **Reaction Mechanism**:  
   - NaNH₂ abstracts a proton (H) from a position adjacent to the bromine to facilitate elimination.  
   - In this case, the only feasible elimination occurs when the base abstracts a proton from position 6, which is adjacent to bromine in position 1.  
   - This leads to the formation of a triple bond (benzyne) between positions 1 and 6, with the deuterium remaining in position 2.

3. **Impact of Deuterium**:  
   - The deuterium in position 2 does not interfere with the elimination process but remains fixed in its position.  
   - This ensures that the reaction produces a single product with a triple bond between positions 1 and 6 and a deuterium in position 2.

4. **Number of Products**:  
   - The reaction yields only one product because the elimination is restricted to a single pathway due to the fixed position of the deuterium and the specific geometry of the benzene ring.

### Conclusion:
The reaction produces a single organic product, making the correct answer **B) 1**.
