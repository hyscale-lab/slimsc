Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate. The solution has a certain concentration of Co(II) and SCN- ions, and I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt species. 

Wait, I remember that when metal ions and ligands combine, they form complexes, and these have stability constants called beta constants. The beta constant tells us how stable a particular complex is. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex.

The problem gives me the stability constants (beta) for different complexes. There are four beta values: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I think that each beta corresponds to a different complex. So, perhaps β1 is for the first complex, like [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for the second, and so on. But wait, wait, the way complexes form is stepwise. So the first complex is CoSCN^+ (with one SCN), the second is Co(SCN)₂^2+, and so on. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact order or the structures. 

Wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Oh, dithiocyanato means two SCN- ions. So that's probably either the β3 or β4 complex. Because the first complex is mono, the second is di, but wait, no, wait. Let me think: the stability constants are given for each step. So β1 is for the first association: Co²+ + SCN⁻ → [CoSCN]^+ (charge +1), β2 is the next step: [CoSCN]^+ + SCN⁻ → [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, and so on until the fourth complex.

Wait, but the problem gives β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, so β3 is the highest at 63. That would mean that the third complex is the most stable, right? But wait, perhaps each beta is for the overall complex. Or do they represent the stepwise formation constants? I think they are the overall formation constants for each complex. Wait, no, no, no. Wait, I think I'm mixing it up. Let me clarify: the stability constant (β) for a complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) would be the product of each step. So, the overall β for the third complex would be β1 * β2 * β3, but no, wait, that's only if they are stepwise. Or perhaps each β is the overall for the nth complex.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The stability constant for the first complex [CoSCN]^+ is β1=9. The second would be [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ with β2=40. But wait, no, wait. Wait, the way stability constants work, each β is for the nth step. So the formation of the first complex (monothiocyanato) is governed by β1. The second complex (dithiocyanato) would have a beta that's the product of β1 and β2, because each step is a separate reaction. Or wait, no, maybe each beta is the cumulative constant for the complex. Hmm, I might need to clarify this.

Wait, no, I think each β represents the stepwise formation. So, β1 is for adding the first SCN, β2 for the second, β3 for the third, etc. So the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) would be the product of β1 through βn. So for the first complex, it's β1. For the second, it's β1 * β2. For the third, β1 * β2 * β3. And for the fourth, β1 * β2 * β3 * β4. 

Wait, but wait, the problem states that the stability constants of the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So, each β is the stepwise constant for that particular step. So the first step is Co²+ + SCN⁻ → [CoSCN]^+ with β1=9. The second step is [CoSCN]^+ + SCN⁻ → [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ with β2=40. The third step is [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ + SCN⁻ → [Co(SCN)₃]^3- with β3=63. And the fourth step is [Co(SCN)₃]^3- + SCN⁻ → [Co(SCN)₄]^4- with β4=16. 

But the problem is about the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is the second complex (two SCN⁻ ions). So the concentration of [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ is what we're after. 

Wait, but wait. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Wait, I'm not sure which complex is blue. Wait, I think that the [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ is the blue complex. Or maybe it's another one. Hmm, no, I'm not certain about that. But the problem says that the blue complex is the dithiocyanato one, so that's [Co(SCN)₂]^2+.

So, to find the percentage of this species among all cobalt species, I need to calculate the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ in the total cobalt concentration.

The total cobalt concentration is given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. So, I'll need to consider the distribution of Co²+ among the different complexes based on the stability constants and the concentrations of SCN-.

I think the approach is to model the distribution of the different complexes using the stability constants and the given concentrations. The general approach for such problems is to calculate the fraction of each complex using the formula that considers the competition between the various complexes based on their stability and the ligand concentration.

The formula for the fraction of each complex is given by the ratio of the concentration of that complex to the total concentration of all complexes. The total concentration is the sum of the concentrations of all possible complexes plus the free Co²+.

But wait, when the concentration of ligand (SCN-) is high, most of the Co²+ will be complexed, and the free Co²+ will be minimal. So perhaps the free Co²+ is negligible. But I'm not sure. Let's think about it.

But given that the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is quite high, so the complexes are likely to be predominant. So, perhaps the free Co²+ is small, but I can't assume it's zero. Hmm.

Alternatively, I can model this using the stability constants and the ligand concentration to find the relative distribution of each complex.

Each complex's concentration can be expressed in terms of the free Co²+ concentration. Let's denote [Co²+] = x.

Then,

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN] 

[Co(SCN)₂]^2+ = β1 * β2 * x * [SCN]^2 

[Co(SCN)3]^3- = β1 * β2 * β3 * x * [SCN]^3 

[Co(SCN)4]^4- = β1 * β2 * β3 * β4 * x * [SCN]^4 

Wait, but wait. Wait, each step adds a SCN⁻. So for each complex, the concentration is (β1 * β2 * ... * βn) * [Co²+] * [SCN]^(n), where n is the number of SCN⁻ ions attached.

So, for each complex:

n=1: [CoSCN]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN] 

n=2: [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ = β1 * β2 * x * [SCN]^2 

n=3: [Co(SCN)3]^3- = β1 * β2 * β3 * x * [SCN]^3 

n=4: [Co(SCN)4]^4- = β1 * β2 * β3 * β4 * x * [SCN]^4 

Wait, but wait. Wait, how does the ligand concentration affect each complex? Oh, yes, each complex requires n SCN⁻ ions, so the concentration is proportional to [SCN]^n.

But in this problem, [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is 1e-1 M. Let's plug in the numbers.

So let's compute for each complex the term (β1 * β2 * ... * βn) * [SCN]^n.

Compute for each n=1 to 4:

n=1: 9 * (0.1)^1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9 

n=2: 9 * 40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6 

n=3: 9 *40 *63 * (0.1)^3 = 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680 * 0.001 = 22.68 

n=4:9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4 = Let's compute step by step.

Wait, let's compute each term step by step.

Compute the product β1*β2*...βn for each n:

n=1: β1 =9

n=2: β1*β2=9*40=360

n=3: 360 *63=22680 

n=4: 22680 *16=362880 

Now, multiply each by (0.1)^n:

n=1: 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

n=2: 360 * 0.01 =3.6 

n=3: 22680 * 0.001 =22.68 

n=4:362880 * 0.0001 =36.288 

So, the terms are 0.9, 3.6, 22.68, 36.288.

Wait, but these are the terms: each is (β1β2..βn) * [SCN]^n.

The sum of these terms will give the ratio of the total complexation, and the fraction for each complex is (term) / (sum of all terms + 1) ?

Wait, no. Because each complex's concentration is proportional to that term, but the free Co²+ is x, which is [Co²+] = x.

So, the total concentration of all Co species is x (free) + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ + [Co(SCN)3]^3- + [Co(SCN)4]^4-.

But the total Co concentration is given as 1e-2 M. So,

x + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ + [Co(SCN)3]^3- + [Co(SCN)4]^4- = 1e-2 

But each [Co... ] is (β1...βn) x [SCN]^n * x 

Wait no, no. Wait, [CoSCN]^+ = β1 x [SCN] * x ?

Wait, no. Because [CoSCN]^+ = β1 * [Co²+] * [SCN]. Similarly, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ = β1*β2 * [Co²+] * [SCN]^2.

So, let me re-express each complex in terms of x:

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 x [SCN] = 9 x (0.1) x = 0.9 x 

[Co(SCN)₂]^2+ = β1 β2 x [SCN]^2 = (9)(40) x (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 x =3.6 x 

[Co(SCN)3]^3- = β1 β2 β3 x [SCN]^3 = 9*40*63 x (0.1)^3 = 22680 * 0.001 x =22.68 x 

[Co(SCN)4]^4- = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN]^4 = 9*40*63*16 x (0.1)^4 = 362880 * 0.0001 x =36.288 x 

And the free Co²+ is x.

So, the total cobalt is:

x + 0.9 x +3.6 x +22.68 x +36.288 x = (1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288) x 

Let me compute that sum.

1 +0.9 is 1.9

1.9 +3.6 is 5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18 

28.18 +36.288=64.468 

So, the total is 64.468 x = 1e-2 M 

So, x = (1e-2) / 64.468 ≈ 1.551e-4 M 

So, x is the concentration of free Co²+.

Now, the concentration of each complex is:

[CoSCN]^+ =0.9 x ≈ 0.9 *1.551e-4 ≈1.396e-4 

[Co(SCN)₂]^2+ =3.6 x ≈3.6 *1.551e-4 ≈5.584e-4 

[Co(SCN)3]^3- =22.68 x ≈22.68 *1.551e-4 ≈3.520e-3 

[Co(SCN)4]^4- =36.288 x ≈36.288 *1.551e-4 ≈5.626e-3 

Wait, but let's compute these accurately.

Wait, but wait, let me compute each term step by step.

Compute each complex's concentration:

n=1: 0.9 * x =0.9*(1.551e-4)=1.3959e-4 

n=2:3.6 *1.551e-4=5.5836e-4 

n=3:22.68 *1.551e-4=22.68 *1.551e-4 

So 22.68 * 1.551e-4 = (22.68 *1.551) *1e-4 

22.68 *1.551: let's compute 22 *1.551=34.122, 0.68 *1.551≈1.05468 → total 35.17668. So 35.17668e-4 ≈ 3.5177e-3 

n=4:36.288 *1.551e-4 

36.288 *1.551 = let's compute: 36 *1.551=55.836. 0.288 *1.551≈0.4475. So sum is about 56.2835. So 56.2835e-4 ≈5.62835e-3 

Now, let's sum all the concentrations:

x ≈1.551e-4 

n=1:1.3959e-4 

n=2:5.5836e-4 

n=3:3.5177e-3 

n=4:5.62835e-3 

Sum all these:

1.551e-4 = 0.0001551 

n=1: 0.00013959 

n=2:0.00055836 

n=3:0.0035177 

n=4:0.00562835 

Add them up:

0.0001551 +0.00013959=0.00029469 

+0.00055836=0.00085305 

+0.0035177=0.00437075 

+0.00562835=0.0099991 

Which is approximately 0.01, which matches the total Co concentration. Good.

Now, the question is about the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, which is the nth=2 complex. Its concentration is 5.5836e-4 M.

So the percentage is (5.5836e-4 / 0.01) *100% = (0.0055836) *100% = 0.55836% ?? That can't be right. Wait, wait, that's way too low. But the options are around 16% to 42%, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait a second, perhaps I messed up the calculation for the sum or the individual terms. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, when I calculated the sum, I might have made a mistake in the initial step. Let me redo the sum:

Each term is:

n=0 (free): x =1.551e-4 

n=1: 0.9x =1.3959e-4 

n=2:3.6x=5.5836e-4 

n=3:22.68x=3.5177e-3 

n=4:36.288x=5.62835e-3 

Wait, sum all:

1.551e-4 = 0.0001551 

0.00013959 → sum so far: 0.00029469 

+0.00055836 → 0.00085305 

+0.0035177 → 0.00437075 

+0.00562835 → 0.0099991 

Which is about 0.01, which is correct. So the calculations seem right.

But then the concentration of the n=2 complex is about 5.58e-4, which is 0.00558 M. So when we divide by the total (0.01 M), that gives 5.58e-4 / 0.01 = 0.0558, or 5.58%? Wait, wait, 5.58e-4 is 0.000558, and 0.000558 / 0.01 is 0.0558, which is 5.58%.

But the options are all higher than 16%. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I swapped the beta values or considered the wrong complexes. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the dithiocyanato complex is the fourth complex, but that seems unlikely. No, the dithiocyanato would have two SCN⁻ ions, so it's the second complex.

Wait, perhaps the stepwise approach is incorrect, and the overall beta is for the nth complex, not the product of previous betas. That would change things entirely.

Wait, wait, perhaps I got the way beta values are given wrong. Maybe each β is the overall formation constant for the nth complex. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^3-, and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^4-.

In that case, the complex [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ would have a beta of β2=40. So, the approach would be different.

Wait, if each β represents the overall formation constant for the nth complex, then the concentration of each complex would be [Co^n] = βn * [Co²+] * [SCN]^n 

Wait, but [Co²+] is the free cobalt concentration, which complicates things because each complex's concentration depends on [Co²+].

So, let's model this with the assumption that each β is the overall constant for the nth complex, not the stepwise.

So, the concentration of each complex is:

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 [Co²+][SCN]

[Co(SCN)₂]^2+ = β2 [Co²+][SCN]^2

[Co(SCN)3]^3- = β3 [Co²+][SCN]^3

[Co(SCN)4]^4- = β4 [Co²+][SCN]^4

And the free [Co²+] is x.

The total cobalt concentration is x + β1 x [SCN] + β2 x [SCN]^2 + β3 x [SCN]^3 + β4 x [SCN]^4 = 1e-2 

So, factoring x:

x (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 ) = 1e-2 

So x = (1e-2) / (1 +β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, but given that [SCN] is 0.1 M, let's compute each term:

β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1 =0.9 

β2 [SCN]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4 

β3 [SCN]^3=63*(0.001)=0.063 

β4 [SCN]^4=16*(0.0001)=0.0016 

So, sum inside the denominator:

1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 =1 +0.9=1.9 +0.4=2.3 +0.063=2.363 +0.0016=2.3646 

So denominator is 2.3646. 

So x=1e-2 / 2.3646 ≈4.226e-3 M 

Wait, that's different from before. So x is about 4.226e-3 M.

Now, each complex's concentration is:

[CoSCN]^+ =β1 x [SCN] =9 *4.226e-3 *0.1 =9 *4.226e-4 = 3.803e-3 

[Co(SCN)₂]^2+ =β2 x [SCN]^2=40 *4.226e-3 *0.01=40 *4.226e-5 =1.690e-3 

[Co(SCN)3]^3- =63 *4.226e-3 *0.001=63 *4.226e-6 =2.662e-4 

[Co(SCN)4]^4- =16 *4.226e-3 *0.0001=16 *4.226e-7 =6.762e-6 

Wait, let me compute each step:

[CoSCN]^+:

9 *4.226e-3 =0.038034 

0.038034 *0.1=0.0038034 → 3.803e-3 M 

[Co(SCN)₂]^2+:

40 *4.226e-3 =0.16904 

0.16904 *0.01=0.0016904 →1.690e-3 M 

[Co(SCN)3]^3-:

63 *4.226e-3 =0.266238 

0.266238 *0.001=0.000266238 →2.662e-4 M 

[Co(SCN)4]^4-:

16 *4.226e-3=0.067616 

0.067616 *0.0001=0.0000067616 →6.762e-6 M 

Now, let's sum all the concentrations:

x=4.226e-3 

n=1:3.803e-3 

n=2:1.690e-3 

n=3:2.662e-4 

n=4:6.762e-6 

Sum:

4.226e-3 =0.004226 

+3.803e-3=0.008029 

+1.690e-3=0.009719 

+0.0002662=0.0099852 

+0.00000676≈ 0.00999196 

So the sum is approximately 0.009992 M, which is close to 0.01, so that makes sense.

Now, the question is about the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, which is the second complex. Its concentration is 1.690e-3 M.

So the percentage is (1.690e-3 / 0.01) *100% = (0.00169 /0.01)*100 =16.9% 

Wait, that's option D:16.9%.

But wait, the options are:

A)42.3%

B)25.6%

C)38.1%

D)16.9%

So the answer would be D.

But wait, earlier when I considered the first approach (where each β is stepwise), the second complex was only about 5.5%, but using this approach, with each β as an overall constant, the percentage is 16.9%.

But which approach is correct? Because the problem states that β1=9, β2=40, etc. So what's the correct way to model this?

Hmm. Another way: stability constants are typically given as the overall formation constant for the nth complex. So for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, β would be the overall constant, which is the product of the stepwise constants. Thus, β2 in that case would be β1 * β2_stepwise. But wait, the problem gives β1 to β4 as 9,40,63,16. So perhaps the way the problem presents them is the stepwise β's for each addition.

So, in the first approach, the stepwise β's, but in the second approach, each β is for the nth complex.

But I'm getting different results based on that assumption.

Wait, let me think. The stability constant for the first complex is β1=9. For the second complex, which is [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, the overall β would be β1 * β2 (stepwise). So β_total for n=2 is 9*40=360.

Wait, so if the problem gives the stepwise constants, then the overall for n=2 is 360.

In that case, the approach would be the first one I took, where the sum inside the denominator was 64.468, leading to x=≈1.55e-4, and the [Co(SCN)₂] was about 5.58e-4, which gives 5.58% as the percentage. But that's not one of the options.

But the options don't include that, so perhaps the problem states that β1 to β4 are the overall constants for each complex. So for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, β is 40. So the approach where each β is the overall constant for the nth complex gives 16.9%, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem uses the definition where the stability constant for the nth complex is the product of the stepwise constants up to n.

So β1=9, β2=9*40=360, β3=9*40*63=22680, β4=22680*16=362880.

But in that case, the denominator would be 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

Which would be 1 +9*(0.1) + 360*(0.1)^2 + 22680*(0.1)^3 + 362880*(0.1)^4 

Compute each term:

9*(0.1)=0.9 

360*(0.01)=3.6 

22680*(0.001)=22.68 

362880*(0.0001)=36.288 

Sum all terms: 1 +0.9=1.9 +3.6=5.5 +22.68=28.18 +36.288=64.468 

So denominator is 64.468. x= (1e-2)/64.468 ≈1.55e-4 M.

Then, the concentration of the second complex is [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ = β2 [Co²+][SCN]^2 =360 * 1.55e-4 * (0.1)^2 

So 360 *1.55e-4=0.0558 

Multiply by (0.1)^2=0.01 →0.0558 *0.01=0.000558 →5.58e-4 

Which is 0.000558 M. 

Then, the percentage is 5.58e-4 / 0.01 →5.58% → not matching any options.

Thus, this approach gives 5.58% which is not an option, so perhaps the correct approach is the second one, with each β being the overall constant for that complex.

So, in that case, the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but the problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16". So each β is the overall constant for the complex. Therefore, the approach where each β is the overall constant is correct. Thus, the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt complexes based on the given stability constants (β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16) and the ligand concentration [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M.

### Key Assumptions and Approach:
1. **Stability Constants**: The given β values represent the overall stability constants for the complexes:
   - β₁ = 9 corresponds to [CoSCN]⁺.
   - β₂ = 40 corresponds to [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺.
   - β₃ = 63 corresponds to [Co(SCN)₃]³⁻.
   - β₄ = 16 corresponds to [Co(SCN)₄]⁴⁻.

2. **Distribution of Complexes**: The concentration of each complex is proportional to its stability constant, the ligand concentration raised to the power of the number of ligands attached, and the free cobalt ion concentration [Co²⁺]. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of the free cobalt ion and all complex species.

3. **Free Cobalt Ion Concentration**: Let [Co²⁺] = x. The total cobalt concentration is expressed as:
   \[
   x + \beta_1 x [\text{SCN}] + \beta_2 x [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_3 x [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_4 x [\text{SCN}]^4 = 10^{-2}
   \]
   Substituting [SCN] = 0.1 M:
   \[
   x (1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4) = 10^{-2}
   \]
   Compute each term:
   - \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] = 9 \times 0.1 = 0.9 \)
   - \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \times (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \)
   - \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \times (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \)
   - \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \times (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \)
   - Total denominator: \( 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646 \)
   Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 4.226 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
   \]

4. **Concentration of Each Complex**:
   - [CoSCN]⁺: \( \beta_1 x [\text{SCN}] = 9 \times 4.226 \times 10^{-3} \times 0.1 = 3.803 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M} \)
   - [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺: \( \beta_2 x [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \times 4.226 \times 10^{-3} \times (0.1)^2 = 1.690 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M} \)
   - [Co(SCN)₃]³⁻: \( \beta_3 x [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \times 4.226 \times 10^{-3} \times (0.1)^3 = 2.662 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{M} \)
   - [Co(SCN)₄]⁴⁻: \( \beta_4 x [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \times 4.226 \times 10^{-3} \times (0.1)^4 = 6.762 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M} \)

5. **Percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺**:
   The percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)₂]²⁺}}{\text{Total Co concentration}} \times 100 = \frac{1.690 \times 10^{-3}}{0.01} \times 100 = 16.9\%.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺, among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
