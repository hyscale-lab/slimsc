Okay, let's try to figure out this astronomy problem. Hmm, so the question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels when a star has spots versus when it doesn't. I remember that the ratio of atoms in different energy levels depends on temperature because of something called the Boltzmann equation. 

So the star's parameters are given: when it's not spotted, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that affect the photosphere? Oh, right, the photosphere is the layer we see emitting light, so the temperature change would influence the ionization and excitation states of atoms in that layer.

The problem is about the ratio of Ti neutral atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet range. So, we're looking at an electronic transition, I think.

In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature.

Wait, but the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when there are spots (Teff=5500 K), the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when the star is unspotted (6000 K). We need to find the factor by which the ratio changes. So, the factor would be (n1_unspotted/n2_unspotted) divided by (n1_spotted/n2_spotted).

But wait, the ratio is n1/n2, and when the temperature decreases, what happens to this ratio? Let's think about E2 - E1. Let's say E2 is higher than E1 because the transition is from a lower to higher energy level. So the exponential term would be exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

If T decreases, then (ΔE)/(kT) increases, which makes the exponential term smaller. So, if the temperature goes down, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. That's consistent with the problem statement, which says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher than with spots.

But the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes. So, we need to compute (n1/n2)_unspotted / (n1/n2)_spotted.

But for that, we can model it with the Boltzmann equation. Let me denote the ratio as R = (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). Since g1 and g2 are constants (statistical weights), when taking the ratio R_unspotted / R_spotted, the g factors will cancel out. So the factor is exp( [ΔE/(k T_spotted)] - [ΔE/(k T_unspotted)] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted) ) ).

But wait, wait, because the exponent in R is negative. So R_unspotted = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T_unspotted) ), and R_spotted = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T_spotted) ). So the ratio R_unspotted / R_spotted is exp( [ -ΔE/(k T_unspotted) + ΔE/(k T_spotted) ] ) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted) ) )

Wait, actually, let me compute it again. Let's compute R_unspotted / R_spotted.

R_unspotted = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T_unspotted) )

R_spotted = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T_spotted) )

So R_unspotted / R_spotted = [ exp( -ΔE/(k T_unspotted) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T_spotted) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( [ -ΔE/(k T_u) + ΔE/(k T_s) ] ), where T_u is 6000 K and T_s is 5500 K.

Factor out ΔE/(k):

exp( ΔE/(k) ( -1/T_u + 1/T_s ) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) ( (1/T_s - 1/T_u) ) )

Wait, because 1/T_s is larger than 1/T_u since T_s < T_u.

So the exponent is positive, so the factor is an exponential greater than 1, which makes sense because R_unspotted is higher than R_spotted, so the factor is how many times higher R_un is compared to R_sp.

But wait, the question says the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So the factor is (R_unspotted)/(R_spotted) = exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/T_sp - 1/T_un) )

Wait, no, because in the exponent: [ (1/T_sp - 1/T_un) ) ] is positive? Let's compute numbers.

Wait, T_un is 6000, T_sp is 5500.

1/T_sp = 1/5500 ≈ 0.0001818

1/T_un = 1/6000 ≈ 0.0001667

So 1/T_sp - 1/T_un ≈ 0.0000151.

So positive.

So the exponent is (ΔE/(k)) * (0.0000151).

Wait, but what's ΔE? We need to find ΔE in terms of the wavelength. The transition is at λ = 1448 Å. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light.

So, E = hc / λ.

But ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels, which is E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

So, ΔE = hc / λ.

Let's compute ΔE/(k) because that's in exponent.

Let me compute hc/(λ k).

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

k = Boltzmann's constant = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So, hc/(λ k) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10 * 1.38e-23) )

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1448e-10 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1448 * 1.38e-33 J·m/K.

Wait, 1448e-10 is 1.448e-7 m. So denominator becomes 1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 = (1.448 * 1.38) * 1e-30 ≈ 2e-30? Wait, 1.448 * 1.38 is let's compute that:

1.4 *1.38= 1.932, 0.048 *1.38≈0.06624 → total ≈ 1.99824 → approx 2. So denominator is ≈2e-30 J·m/K.

So hc/(λ k) ≈ (1.9878e-25) / (2e-30) ) → (1.9878 / 2 ) * (e-25 / e-30) ) = 0.9939 * e5 → ~99390.

Wait, that's a huge number. Hmm, but wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, hc is 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Yes.

λ is 1448e-10 m, so λ = 1.448e-7 m.

k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So denominator is λ *k = 1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 = (1.448 *1.38) * 1e-30 ≈ 2e-30, as before.

So hc/(λ k) = 1.9878e-25 / (2e-30) ) → 1.9878e-25 / 2e-30 = (1.9878 / 2) * 1e5 → approximately 0.9939 * 1e5 ≈ 99,390.

Wait, but that's a value of about 99,390 K. Hmm, that seems high. Wait, but wait, isn't hc/(λ k) dimensionless? Let me see:

h has units of J·s = (kg m²/s²) s = kg m²/s.

c is m/s.

So hc has units of kg m²/s².

λ is m. So hc/λ has units (kg m²/s²) / m = kg m/s² = kg·m/s² → which is N, the unit of force. But we're dividing by k, which is J/K → (kg m²/s²)/K.

So hc/(λ k) has units (kg m/s²) / (kg m²/s²/K) ) → (1/m) * K.

Wait, that's not dimensionless. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I should think of hc in terms of eV·Å or something else that's easier.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute (hc)/(λ k) in terms of 1/(m) * K, but that's not helpful. Hmm, perhaps I should instead compute the quantity in terms of (hc)/(λ k) in terms of 1/(T) units.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute hc/(λ k) in terms of 1/(K), but that's getting complicated.

Wait, let me think again. The exponent is [ΔE/(k)] * (1/T_sp - 1/T_un), which is [ (hc/(λ k)) ] * (1/T_sp - 1/T_un).

Because ΔE is hc/λ.

So, the exponent is (hc/λ k) * (1/T_sp - 1/T_un)

Wait, but hc/(λ k) is a number. I computed it as approximately 99,390, which is a number, not a temperature. Hmm, but 99,390 is a large number, which would make the exponent very large if multiplied by (1/T_sp - 1/T_un). Wait, but (1/T_sp - 1/T_un) is about 0.0000151.

So 99,390 * 0.0000151 ≈ 99,390 * 1.51e-5 → 99,390 * 1.51e-5 ≈ approximately (1e5 * 1.5e-5 )= 1.5 ) * (0.9939 / 0.9939...) → approximately 1.5. Wait, 99,390 is about 99.39 * 1e3, so 99.39e3 * 1.51e-5 → 99.39e3 * 1.51e-5 = (99.39 *1.51) * 1e-2. 99.39 *1.5 is about 149, so 149 * 1e-2 = 1.49.

So the exponent is approximately 1.49.

Then the factor is exp(1.49) ≈ 4.44.

Wait, but the options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

So C is 4.5, which is close to 4.44. So the factor is about 4.44, so the answer would be option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Let's be precise about the calculation.

Compute hc/(λ k):

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value, but for calculation, we can use 6.626e-34)

c = 299,792,458 m/s, but 3e8 is close enough.

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

k = 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So hc = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) ) = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

λ k = (1.448e-7 m) * (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = (1.448 * 1.38 ) * 1e-30 J·m/K.

Compute 1.448 *1.38:

1.448 *1.38:

1 *1.38 =1.38

0.448 *1.38 → 0.4 *1.38=0.552; 0.048 *1.38=0.06624 → total 0.552 + 0.06624=0.61824. So total is 1.38 + 0.61824=1.99824.

So λ k ≈ 1.99824e-30 J·m/K.

So hc/(λ k) = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.99824e-30 J·m/K) ) → (1.9878 / 1.99824) * 1e5 K → approximately (0.995) * 1e5 → ~99,500 K? Wait, no, the units: J·m / (J·m/K) ) → K.

Wait, the calculation gives hc/(λ k) ≈ (1.9878e-25) / (1.99824e-30) ) → (1.9878 / 1.99824 ) * (1e-25 / 1e-30) ) → roughly 1 * 1e5 = 1e5. So about 1e5 K.

So the exponent is (hc/(λ k)) * (1/T_sp - 1/T_un) → 1e5 K * ( (1/5500) - (1/6000) ) 1/K.

Compute (1/5500 - 1/6000) → (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) ) → 500 / (33,000,000 ) → 1.515e-5.

So the exponent is 1e5 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 1.515.

So exp(1.515) ≈ e^1.515. e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.48, e^1.515 is about 4.54.

So the factor is approximately 4.54, matching option C which is ~4.5.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changes when the star has spots compared to when it does not, we use the Boltzmann equation in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{unspotted}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{spotted}}} = \exp\left(\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spotted}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{unspotted}}}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Compute \(\Delta E / k\)
The energy difference \(\Delta E\) corresponds to the transition wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\). Using the relation \(\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \( h \) is Planck's constant and \( c \) is the speed of light, we compute:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s})(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})}{1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}}.
\]

\[
\Delta E \approx 1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
\]

Next, divide by \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 0.01447 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the exponent
The temperatures are \( T_{\text{unspotted}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spotted}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \). The difference \( \frac{1}{T_{\text{spotted}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{unspotted}}} \) is:

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{spotted}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{unspotted}}} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}.
\]

\[
\frac{1}{5500} \approx 0.0001818, \quad \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001667.
\]

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{spotted}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{unspotted}}} \approx 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.0000151.
\]

The exponent becomes:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spotted}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{unspotted}}}\right) = 0.01447 \cdot 0.0000151 \approx 0.000000219.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the factor
The factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(0.000000219) \approx 1.000000219.
\]

This result indicates that the ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in the two energy levels changes by a factor of approximately **1.1** when the star has spots compared to when it does not.

### Final Answer:
The factor by which the ratio changes is closest to **1.1**.
