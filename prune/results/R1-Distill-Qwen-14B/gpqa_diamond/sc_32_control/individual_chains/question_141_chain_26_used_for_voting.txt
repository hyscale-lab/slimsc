Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to figure out how many possible organic products there are.

First, I'll try to recall what I know about such reactions. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. It's commonly used in conditions where we need to form aromatic rings with substituents—like in the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent, maybe via elimination or some kind of substitution.

Wait, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, I'm not exactly sure what "2-d" stands for. Oh, right, sometimes in IUPAC nomenclature, the "-d" might indicate a deuterium substitution. But wait, maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be 2-dimethylamino? Or perhaps it's a typo, and the structure is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene? Hmm, maybe I should think it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. Oh, because NaNH2 is a strong base, and if there's a good leaving group, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, where the "d" refers to something else, like a deuterium. Alternatively, maybe it's 2-dimethylaminobromobenzene, but I'm not entirely certain. Wait, perhaps the question is about a benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and another substituent at position 2. Let me try to visualize the structure.

Benzene has six positions. If the bromine is at position 1, then position 2 is adjacent to it. So the structure is bromine at 1, and something else at 2. Let's say it's a substituent like -NH2, but that's probably not right. Wait, but the question mentions treatment with NaNH2. So perhaps the starting material is benzene with a bromine and another group which can be deprotonated or involved in a reaction.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. Because sometimes, when you have a strong base like NaNH2, it can deprotonate the dimethylamino group if it's acidic enough. The dimethylamino group is an activating group, and the NH (if any) might be a good site for deprotonation.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a methyl group or something else. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the "d" stands for another substituent, like a deuterium, but that's less likely in this context.

Wait, perhaps the compound is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. So the benzene ring has bromine in position 1 and a dimethylamino group in position 2.

Now, when you treat this with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent, what happens? NaNH2 is a strong base, and in this solvent, it can act as a base for deprotonation, especially of acidic protons.

Looking at the substituents on the benzene ring, the dimethylamino group is a strong activating group, and its NH protons are somewhat acidic. But wait, the dimethylamino group is a strong base itself, but in this case, perhaps the solvent is ammonia, so maybe the solution is deprotonating something else.

Wait, another possibility: the bromide is in position 1, and the substituent in position 2 is a hydrogen. Oh, wait, that can't be because the formula is 1-bromo-2-d, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, perhaps the substituent in position 2 is a methyl group or another group that can be deprotonated. Alternatively, perhaps the "d" refers to a deuterium, but that might be a red herring.

Alternatively, maybe the "d" is a typo, and the substituent is a -CH2 group. Hmm, this is getting confusing. I'm probably overcomplicating it. Let me think about the reaction conditions again.

NaNH2 in NH3 is a common condition for elimination reactions, especially in aromatic chemistry. For example, in the formation of aromatic rings via elimination. So perhaps the bromide is leaving, and the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a new substituent.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond. But that doesn't make sense because benzene is already fully conjugated. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an -NH2 group. So the starting material is bromobenzene with an amino group in the adjacent position. But wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, and in such conditions, perhaps the amino group is deprotonated, making it a better leaving group? No, that doesn't make sense because NH2- isn't a good leaving group. Wait, perhaps under strong base conditions, the amino group is deprotonated, making the ring more activated towards elimination.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a Hunsdiecker-type reaction, but I don't think that applies here. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solvent is liquid ammonia, which is a good solvent for such reactions. NaNH2 is a strong base, so maybe it's deprotonating a hydrogen adjacent to the bromine, leading to an elimination reaction. For example, if there's a hydrogen next to the bromide, the base could abstract it, leading to the formation of a double bond and the loss of HBr as a leaving group. But in benzene, the structure is fully conjugated, so elimination would form a diene? No, that doesn't make sense because benzene already has a conjugated system.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction where the bromide leaves, and ammonia acts as a nucleophile. But NaNH2 is a source of NH2-, but in a polar aprotic solvent, perhaps SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution) occurs. But for SNAr to happen, the ring must be strongly activated towards the substitution, typically with electron-withdrawing groups in the meta positions.

Wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. So the substituents are at positions 1 (Br) and 2 (NMe2). So the ring has Br at position 1 and a strong activating group (NMe2) at position 2. The dimethylamino group is a strong activating (ortho/para) director. So if the Br is at position 1, and the NMe2 is at position 2, perhaps the ring is activated in such a way that substitution occurs.

Wait, but SNAr typically requires meta-directing groups, but the NMe2 is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So maybe in this case, the Br is in a position where substitution could occur. Wait, but the leaving group is in position 1, and the activating group is in position 2. So perhaps the ring is activated in positions 3,4,5,6? Wait, no, the activating groups direct incoming nucleophiles to their ortho and para positions. So in this case, the NMe2 group at position 2 directs incoming nucleophiles to positions 1, 3, and 6.

Wait, but the Br is at position 1, so maybe the ring is already activated in that position. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation, but I don't think NaNH2 is used for that. Alternatively, the conditions might be for elimination to form a benzene ring with a double bond, but that's not possible since benzene is already a ring of conjugated double bonds.

Wait, perhaps the substituent at position 2 is a hydroxyl group. But in that case, the base would deprotonate it, but I'm not sure how that would lead to substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group. Let's say the structure is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene. Then, treatment with a strong base like NaNH2 could abstract a proton adjacent to the methyl group, leading to elimination of HBr and forming a benzene ring with a double bond. Wait, but benzene doesn't have double bonds; it's a ring of delocalized electrons. So elimination would form a diene, which isn't possible in benzene. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a hydrogen, and the reaction is about deprotonation. If the substituent is a hydrogen, then the structure is just bromobenzene with a substituent. No, that wouldn't make sense. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is about forming aniline derivatives. Wait, if the substituent is a nitro group or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the Br is replaced by a strong base like NH2-. But in aromatic substitution, that's typically not straightforward unless the ring is activated in a way that allows for such substitution.

Wait, let's think about the positions. If the Br is at position 1, and the substituent at position 2 is a strong activating group (like NMe2), then perhaps the ring is activated in such a way that substitution can occur at position 1. But in SNAr, the leaving group is typically at a position activated by electron-withdrawing groups. Wait, but NMe2 is an activating group (electron-donating), which would not activate the ring for nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't substitution but elimination. For example, if there's a hydrogen adjacent to Br, such as in the ortho position, the base could abstract that H, leading to the formation of a double bond and elimination of HBr. But in benzene, all the positions are sp2 hybridized and already have double bonds. So that's not possible. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking about the wrong mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene, and the reaction is a Hofmann elimination. Wait, Hofmann elimination involves treating amines with a strong base, leading to the elimination of an amine and formation of an alkene. But that's for aliphatic amines, not aromatic ones.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is about forming an aromatic diamine. But I'm not sure how that would proceed with NaNH2.

Alternatively, maybe the Br is replaced by an amide group. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is about the formation of aniline from bromobenzene via amination. But in this case, the substituent is a dimethylamino group. So maybe the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by an amino group.

Wait, but in aromatic substitution, you usually need a good leaving group and activating groups. Bromide is a leaving group, but the ring must be activated for such substitution. If the ring has an activating group in the ortho or para position, that could help. In this case, the substituent is at position 2 (ortho to Br at 1).

Wait, but activating groups help in electrophilic substitution. For nucleophilic substitution, you usually need deactivating groups. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a Fittig reaction, but I think that involves coupling of aryl halides with sodium in ammonia to form biaryls. But that typically uses a metal like sodium, and the product is a biaryl. So for example, 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene reacting with sodium in ammonia would form a bond between the aromatic rings. But that would require another aryl halide, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, but the question is about treating with NaNH2, not sodium. So perhaps it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring expansion or contraction, but that's probably not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the Br is in position 1, and the substituent at 2 is a hydrogen. Then the structure is just bromobenzene. But then, what would NaNH2 do? Maybe deprotonate somewhere, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene, and the reaction is an elimination to form a nitrile or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a double bond, but that's not possible since benzene is already fully conjugated.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about what NaNH2 in NH3 does. It's a strong base, often used for deprotonation. For example, it can deprotonate alkanes to form carbanions. Or in aromatic chemistry, for forming benzynes.

Wait, benzynes! Oh, right, when an aryl halide is treated with a strong base, it can eliminate to form a benzyne intermediate. The mechanism involves deprotonation of a hydrogen adjacent to the leaving group, leading to the formation of a triple bond (or a diradical intermediate), which then can undergo cycloaddition reactions if another aryl halide is present. But in this case, the solvent is ammonia, so perhaps the benzyne would capture an amide.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene, the Br is at position 1 and NMe2 is at position 2. So positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. If the base deprotonates a hydrogen beta to Br (in the meta position?), but wait, that's adjacent. So if Br is at position 1, perhaps the hydrogen at position 2 is being abstracted. But wait, position 2 already has a substituent (NMe2), so maybe the hydrogen is at position 3? Or perhaps position 6.

Alternatively, maybe the hydrogen being abstracted is adjacent to Br, which would be position 2, but that's already occupied by NMe2. So perhaps there's a hydrogen at position 3, which is meta to Br. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the reaction of an aryl bromide with NaNH2 in NH3 can lead to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond, i.e., forming a benzyne intermediate. But for that, the halide must be adjacent to a hydrogen that can be abstracted to form the triple bond.

So, for example, if the structure is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, the base could abstract the hydrogen from the methyl group adjacent to Br, leading to elimination of HBr and forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. Then, this benzyne can react with another molecule, perhaps, but in this case, the solvent is ammonia. So maybe the benzyne would react with NH2- to form a new product.

But in the given starting material, the substituent at position 2 is NMe2, not a hydrogen. So perhaps the hydrogen is not adjacent to Br, making elimination difficult. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is such that a hydrogen is available for abstraction.

Wait, perhaps the substituent at position 2 is a hydrogen, but the formula is 1-bromo-2-d, which I'm still not entirely clear on. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group, making the structure 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene. Then, NaNH2 would deprotonate the methyl group adjacent to Br, leading to elimination of HBr and forming a triple bond (benzyne) between positions 1 and 2. Then, the benzyne could react with ammonia or other nucleophiles.

But in the presence of NaNH2 and NH3, perhaps the ammonia acts as a nucleophile. So the benzyne (a diradical or a triple bond) could react with NH2- to form a product.

Wait, if the benzyne is formed, it's a strained triple bond, which can undergo [2+2] cycloaddition reactions, but in this case, perhaps it's more about the reaction with the amide.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne would undergo trapping with an amide nucleophile. So when the benzyne is formed, the ammonia (which is deprotonated by NaNH2) provides NH2- which could attack the benzyne.

But wait, how would that attack happen? Benzyne is symmetric, so the attack could occur at either end, but in this case, the substituents might influence where the attack occurs.

Wait, but in my initial structure, the substituent is at position 2. So when the benzyne forms between positions 1 and 2, perhaps the substituent is now in a position that affects the attack.

Alternatively, perhaps in this case, the benzyne would form, and then the reaction would lead to the formation of a new ring. But I'm getting a bit lost here.

Wait, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with an amino group where the Br was. So the Br is replaced by NH2. But under what conditions would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by the amide group (NH2-). But I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, where two molecules of the starting material react to form a biphenyl structure. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: maybe the substituent at position 2 is a hydroxyl group. Then, the reaction could involve elimination of water to form a triple bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitro group. But again, I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to outline what I know:

- Starting material: 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The "d" is unclear, but perhaps it's a substituent like NMe2.

- Reagent: NaNH2 in condensed NH3.

- NaNH2 is a strong base, used for deprotonation or elimination.

So possible reactions:

1. If the substituent is such that a hydrogen can be abstracted adjacent to Br, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a triple bond (benzyne).

2. If the substituent is a good leaving group, substitution could occur, but I'm not sure about the conditions.

3. The substituent could be deprotonated, activating the ring for some reaction.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the substituent is a methyl group. So the structure is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene. Then, NaNH2 would deprotonate the methyl group adjacent to Br, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. Then, the triple bond is a benzyne, which can react with the amide ions (NH2-) in the solvent.

So, the benzyne would be a highly strained structure, and the reaction could proceed via a cycloaddition or via attack by the amide.

Alternatively, the benzyne could undergo a [2+2] cycloaddition with another benzene ring, but without another dienophile, that's not possible here.

Alternatively, the benzyne could react with NH2- to form a new product.

Wait, but the solvent is NH3, which is a nucleophile. So perhaps when the benzyne is formed, the NH2- can attack it, leading to the formation of a new ring.

But I'm not entirely sure about the outcome. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces an aromatic diamine.

Wait, perhaps the product would have an amino group where the Br was. So the Br is substituted by NH2.

But under what conditions would NaNH2 induce such substitution? SNAr requires a good leaving group and a strongly activated ring. But in this case, the substituent at position 2 is a strong activating group, which may not help SNAr because that typically requires deactivating groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't substitution but elimination followed by some kind of addition.

Wait, another thought: when benzyne is formed, it can react with an amide ion to form a new product. The benzyne has two triple bonds, so the attack could happen at either position, leading to different products.

But wait, in the starting material, the substituent is at position 2, so when benzyne forms between positions 1 and 2, the substituent is at position 2. So when the amide attacks, it would add to position 1 or 2, but position 2 already has a substituent.

Wait, perhaps the amide attacks position 3, leading to a new substituent there.

Alternatively, the attack could happen at position 2, but since it's already substituted, that's not possible. So perhaps the amide adds to position 4 or 6.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible products.

If the benzyne is formed between positions 1 and 2, then the attack by NH2- could happen at either end, leading to products where NH2 is added to position 1 or 2.

But wait, position 1 is where the Br was, and position 2 has the substituent. So if the attack is at position 1, we get a NH2 group there, and the substituent at position 2 remains. Alternatively, attack at position 2 would lead to NH2 at position 2, but that's already occupied.

Wait, perhaps the substituent at position 2 is a good leaving group, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction proceeds via a different mechanism. Maybe it's a substitution where the Br is replaced by NH2. But I'm not sure if that's feasible under these conditions.

Wait, in aromatic substitution, it's difficult to substitute Br with NH2 because it's an electrophilic substitution, but NH2 is a nucleophile. So perhaps it's not SNAr but some other mechanism.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a Ullmann coupling, but that typically requires a copper catalyst and high temperatures, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling via elimination and addition.

Wait, perhaps the Br is eliminated, forming a benzene ring with a triple bond (benzyne), and then the amide nucleophile adds to that.

So, starting with 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, we eliminate HBr to form a triple bond between 1 and 2. Then, the amide (NH2-) attacks, leading to the formation of a new product.

But in this case, the substituent at position 2 is NMe2, so perhaps the attack happens at position 3 or 4.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure and possible products. Let me try to visualize the positions again.

If the starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene, the benzene ring has Br at position 1, and NMe2 at position 2.

When NaNH2 is added, perhaps it deprotonates a hydrogen adjacent to the Br. For Br at position 1, the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. But position 2 already has NMe2, so the only available hydrogen would be at position 6. So the base abstracts the hydrogen at position 6, leading to the formation of a carbanion adjacent to Br. Then, the Br leaves, and the carbanion attacks a neighboring carbon, forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. Wait, but wait—actually, in benzene, the positions are arranged in a ring, so position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6.

So after deprotonation at position 6, the Br at 1 would leave, and the carbanion at position 6 would form a triple bond with position 1, leading to benzyne between positions 1 and 6.

Then, this benzyne could react with the amide ion (NH2-) from the solvent.

The benzyne is symmetric, so the attack could happen at either end. But given the substituents, perhaps the attack is directed.

Wait, the substituent is at position 2, which is adjacent to position 1 and 3.

So the benzyne formed would have positions 1 and 6 as triple bond. The amide ion could attack either position 1 or 6.

If it attacks position 1, we'd get an NH2 group at position 1, but originally, that's where the Br was. Alternatively, it could attack position 6, leading to NH2 at position 6.

But the starting material already has substituents at positions 1 (Br) and 2 (NMe2). So after elimination, the Br is gone, and the substituent at 2 remains, but the attack by NH2- would add NH2 at position 1 or 6.

Wait, but wait: the benzyne is a six-membered ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. So the attack by NH2- could happen at either end, leading to two possible products: one with NH2 at position 1 and the other at position 6.

But wait, position 1 is where the Br was. So after substitution, the product would have NH2 at 1 and NMe2 at 2, and possibly something else. Alternatively, the substituent at 2 might influence the regiochemistry of the attack.

Alternatively, perhaps the attack occurs at a position meta to the substituent. Hmm.

Wait, in the starting material, with substituents at 1 (Br) and 2 (NMe2), the benzyne forms between 1 and 6. Then, the amide ion could attack at position 1 or 6.

But when the attack happens at position 1 (which was the site of Br), would that lead to a new substituent there, or would it replace the Br. Alternatively, perhaps attack at position 6 would add NH2 at 6, leading to a product with substituents at 2 (NMe2) and 6 (NH2).

Alternatively, the benzyne could capture two amide ions, leading to diamines. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but perhaps each molecule of benzyne can react with one molecule of amide, leading to monosubstitution. So the possible products would be:

1. Benzene ring with substituents at position 2 (NMe2) and position 1 (NH2).

2. Benzene ring with substituents at position 2 (NMe2) and position 6 (NH2).

Wait, but where exactly would the attack happen? The substituent at position 2 is an activating group, which is ortho/para directing. So perhaps the attack by NH2- would prefer positions that are activated by the substituent.

Wait, but the benzyne is a symmetrical structure between positions 1 and 6. So the attack could happen at either end, leading to two different products. Therefore, the number of possible organic products would be two.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction results in only one product because the substituent directs the attack to a particular position.

Wait, but the substituent is at position 2, which is adjacent to position 1. So when the benzyne forms between 1 and 6, the substituent at 2 is in the ortho position to position 1, which is where the attack could be directed.

So perhaps the attack occurs predominantly at position 1, leading to a single product with NH2 at position 1 and NMe2 at position 2.

But earlier I thought there might be two possible products, but if the substituent directs the attack, maybe only one product is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the attack can happen at both positions, leading to two products.

Wait, but if the substituent is at position 2, which is meta to position 6, would it influence the attack at position 6? Hmm, perhaps not as strongly as at position 1.

So maybe the attack occurs more at position 1, leading to one main product. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but in the benzyne intermediate, the ring is symmetric, so the attack can occur at either end. So without any directing substituent in that region, both positions would be equally reactive. But the substituent at position 2 might deactivate certain positions.

Alternatively, the substituent at position 2 (NMe2) is a strong activating group, which could direct the attack to positions ortho and para to it. So the positions ortho to NMe2 are positions 1 and 3. Para would be position 5.

So in the benzyne structure, the positions available for attack are 1 and 6. Position 1 is ortho to NMe2, so it's more activated for attack. Position 6 is meta to NMe2, so less activated.

Therefore, the attack would likely occur at position 1, leading to a single product with NH2 at position 1.

But wait, if the substituent at 2 is a dimethylamino group, which is strongly activating and ortho/para-directing, then any new substituent would enter at ortho or para positions relative to it.

So, when the benzyne forms between positions 1 and 6, the substituent at 2 would direct the attack of NH2- to position 1 (ortho) or position 3 (another ortho position) or position 5 (para). But position 3 and 5 are not part of the benzyne's triple bond, so maybe the attack can only happen at position 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the attack can only happen at positions 1 and 6, which are part of the triple bond. So, the substituent at 2 directs the attack to position 1, making it the major product.

In that case, only one product would form.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent at 2 doesn't influence the attack on the benzyne, leading to two possible products.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between thinking it's one product or two.

Wait, another angle: when benzyne is formed, the triple bond is between 1 and 6. The substituent at 2 is in the ortho position relative to position 1. So the attack at position 1 would be favored due to the activating effect of the substituent at 2.

Therefore, the amide ion would attack position 1, leading to a new substituent there. So the product would have substituents at positions 1 (NH2) and 2 (NMe2).

But wait, the original Br was at 1. So after substitution, the product would have NH2 at 1 and NMe2 at 2. But could there be another product where the attack occurs at position 6, leading to NH2 at 6 and NMe2 at 2?

If the substituent at 2 doesn't influence the attack at position 6, then perhaps both products are possible. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the attack at position 6 is not favored because the substituent at 2 is meta to position 6, making that position less activated. So the attack would mainly happen at position 1, leading to a single product.

But I'm not entirely confident. If the attack is only at position 1, the number of products would be one. If it can happen at both positions, then two products.

Wait, the question asks how many possible organic products are formed. So perhaps in this case, there are two possible products, depending on where the amide ion attacks the benzyne.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to only one product due to the directing effect of the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent doesn't influence the attack, leading to two possible products.

I think I'm going to have to make an educated guess here. If the reaction forms a benzyne, which can react at two positions, and the substituent at position 2 directs the attack to position 1, then there's only one major product.

But considering the possibility of attack at both ends (positions 1 and 6), perhaps two products are possible.

Wait, but the substituent at 2 is not in the vicinity of position 6. So maybe the attack at position 6 isn't influenced by the substituent, leading to two possible products: NH2 at 1 and NH2 at 6.

But wait, position 6 is meta to the substituent at 2. So it's less activated. So perhaps the attack is more likely at position 1, leading to one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent at 2 doesn't influence the attack on the benzyne, so both positions are equally reactive, leading to two products.

Hmm, this is tricky. I'm not entirely sure, but I think the reaction would form two possible products.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in a condensed ammonia solvent. The starting material is assumed to be 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene, where the bromine is at position 1, and the dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) is at position 2. NaNH₂ is a strong base, and in this solvent, it can facilitate deprotonation and elimination reactions.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reaction Conditions**: NaNH₂ in NH₃ is known to induce elimination reactions in aryl halides, forming a benzyne intermediate. This occurs when a hydrogen adjacent to the leaving group (bromine) is abstracted, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a triple bond (benzyne) between the two adjacent positions.

2. **Structure of the Starting Material**: The bromine is at position 1, and the dimethylamino group is at position 2. The dimethylamino group is a strong electron-donating group, which activates the ring and directs substitution or elimination reactions.

3. **Formation of Benzyne**: The base (NaNH₂) abstracts a hydrogen from a position adjacent to the bromine (likely position 6, as position 2 is already occupied by the dimethylamino group). This leads to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6, creating a benzyne intermediate.

4. **Reactivity of Benzyne**: Benzyne is a highly strained and reactive intermediate. It can react with nucleophiles such as NH₂⁻ (amide ion) present in the solvent. The reaction can occur at either end of the triple bond, leading to different products.

5. **Possible Products**:
   - **Attack at Position 1**: The amide ion attacks position 1, replacing the bromine with an amino group (-NH₂). This results in a product with substituents at positions 1 (-NH₂) and 2 (-NMe₂).
   - **Attack at Position 6**: The amide ion attacks position 6, resulting in a product with substituents at positions 2 (-NMe₂) and 6 (-NH₂).

6. **Regioselectivity**: The dimethylamino group at position 2 is an ortho/para-directing group. However, in this case, the reaction at position 6 is not strongly influenced by the substituent, as it is meta to the dimethylamino group. Thus, both positions (1 and 6) are reactive, leading to two possible products.

### Conclusion:
The reaction produces two distinct organic products, depending on where the amide ion attacks the benzyne intermediate. These products are:
1. Benzene with -NH₂ at position 1 and -NMe₂ at position 2.
2. Benzene with -NH₂ at position 6 and -NMe₂ at position 2.

Thus, there are **two possible organic products**.
