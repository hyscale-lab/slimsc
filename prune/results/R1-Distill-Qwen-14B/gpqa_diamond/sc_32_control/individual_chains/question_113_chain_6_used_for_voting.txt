Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the unknown compound is based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's take it step by step.

The question gives me four possible options for the chemical formula, all with different combinations of carbons, hydrogens, and oxygens. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

The spectroscopic data includes FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I'll start by analyzing each piece of data.

Starting with the FTIR: The spectrum has a very broad peak around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but the question says it's a very broad peak. Oh, right, a very broad and strong O-H stretch is typical of either an alcohol (though alcohols usually have less broad peaks than something else) or maybe a carboxylic acid, which has a very broad O-H stretch due to hydrogen bonding.

Then, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Those look like carbonyl (C=O) stretches. The 1700 is probably a ketone or maybe an ester or a carboxylic acid. The 1650 could be an conjugated carbonyl group, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone or an ester or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. Alternatively, it could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an acid derivative.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl H are the ones attached to a double bond, so that suggests the compound has a double bond, probably in a conjugated system. So maybe an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound, like a ketone with a double bond next to it, or perhaps an ester with a double bond nearby.

Mass Spectrometry: The fragment peak is at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is a key mass. Let me think about possible fragments. The most abundant fragment ion at m/z 45 might be from a CH3CO group (which is 44 for CH3CO without the O?), no, wait. Alternatively, maybe a (CH2)2O group? Wait, 45 would be C3H7O? Or perhaps it's a fragment from an ester or a ketone.

Wait, but let's think about possible functional groups. The IR suggests either an alcohol (O-H) and a carbonyl group. So possible structures could be a ketone with an alcohol, but that's less common. Alternatively, maybe an ester (which has both an O-H in the ester group and a carbonyl). Or perhaps a carboxylic acid, which has a strong O-H and a carbonyl.

Wait, but the two carbonyl peaks in IR: 1700 and 1650. That might suggest two different carbonyl groups, but that seems unlikely. Or perhaps one is an ester (around 1700) and another is an conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring. Oh, wait, maybe the 1650 is from a conjugated double bond, like an aromatic ring. Wait, IR peaks for aromatic C=C are around 1600-1650 cm-1. So maybe the 1650 is an aromatic ring, and the 1700 is a carbonyl, like an ester or ketone.

But the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests an double bond, perhaps conjugated with a carbonyl. So maybe the structure is something like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester or something like that. Hmm.

Let's think about the possible molecular formulas. The options are:

A) C6H12O2: that would have a degree of unsaturation of (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X (halogens) or N, (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree (could be a ring and a double bond, or two rings, etc.)

B) C6H10O: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2 degrees. So two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

C) C6H10O2: (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2= (14-10)/2=2 degrees.

D) C6H12O: (2*6 +2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1 degree.

So each option has varying degrees of unsaturation. Looking at the NMR, vinyl protons suggest a double bond. So the compound should have at least one double bond, which is a degree of unsaturation.

If the compound also has a ring (another degree), then the formula must have at least two degrees. So options B and C have two degrees, while A and D have one each.

But wait, the presence of two carbonyl peaks in IR (1700 and 1650) might indicate two carbonyl groups. Wait, no, because 1700 is a carbonyl (like a ketone or ester), and 1650 could be an aromatic ring (conjugated C=C) or another carbonyl. If it's a conjugated carbonyl, maybe from an ester with a conjugated double bond.

Wait, let's think again. The two strong IR peaks: 1700 and 1650. Maybe one is a carbonyl, and the other is an aromatic ring. So then, the compound has both a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring. But wait, the problem says it's an unknown compound. Could it be something like an aromatic ester or a ketone with an aromatic ring?

Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. So the structure would have a conjugated double bond next to the carbonyl, which would explain the vinyl H in the NMR.

Another thought: If the IR peak at 1700 is a carbonyl (like an ester) and the 1650 is a conjugated double bond, then the structure might be something like methyl acrylate or similar.

But the other IR peak at 3000 is broad and strong, which could be an O-H stretch. So perhaps it's an ester with an alpha,beta-unsaturated group, but also maybe an alcohol group. Hmm, but that might complicate the structure.

Wait, no. An ester has an O-H stretch? No, wait, the ester's O-H is actually from the -COOR group. Wait, I think in an ester, the O-H is not present because the ester is formed from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol, so the O-H would have been removed. So if the IR shows a broad O-H, maybe it's a different group, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H is very broad. But then, the 1700 peak might be the carboxylic acid's carbonyl (around 1700 cm-1 is for esters and ketones, but carboxylic acids are a bit lower, around 1700 as well, but maybe a bit lower, like 1680 or so. Alternatively, maybe it's another carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone), which would have a carbonyl group and an O-H if it's a diol or something else? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: the mass spec shows a fragment at m/z 45. Let's think about possible fragments. 45 could be (CH3)2CO, which is 58, no. Wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. Let's calculate possible fragments.

45 could be: 45= (CH2O) would be 30, but that's not. Wait, maybe a methyl group with something else. Wait, 45 is 45, so let's see: 45 is 45 = C3H7O? Let's compute the formula for 45.

The molar mass of a fragment at 45 would be 45 g/mol. Let's think: possible groups.

- CH3COOH (but that's 60). No.
- Maybe (CH2)2O: (12*2)+(2*4)+16=24+8+16=48. No.
- CH2CH2O? Wait, that's same as CH2O, which is formaldehyde, 30. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is CH2=CH-O-R or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone fragment.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be an acylium ion. For example, CH3CO+ would be 43, but 45 is two more. So maybe (CH2)CO+? Let's see: (12*2)+16 +1= 45. Wait, (CH2)2CO+ would be 43 (but that's 29 for (CH2)CO, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a methyl group attached to something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cleavage product. Let me think about the molecular formula options.

The options are all C6H??O. So, the molecular formula must be one of these. Let's think about what kind of fragments would form. For example, if the molecule is something like methyl acrylate (CH2=CHCOOCH3), which is C4H6O2. But our options are C6.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diethyl ester or something similar.

Wait, maybe the compound is an ester with a conjugated double bond, like an α,β-unsaturated ester.

Another approach: Let's consider each option and see which fits the data.

Option A: C6H12O2.

Degree of unsaturation is 1. That could be a ring or a double bond. But since we have vinyl H, maybe a double bond.

But the IR shows two carbonyls, so perhaps two carbonyls. But option A has two oxygens. So maybe an ester and another carbonyl group? Or perhaps a cyclic ester with a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O.

Degree of unsaturation is 2. So maybe a ring and a double bond. But the IR suggests a carbonyl and an O-H group. So perhaps a cyclic ether with a carbonyl? Not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2.

Degree of unsaturation is 2. So perhaps a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. But the presence of vinyl H suggests a double bond. So maybe a ring and a double bond.

Option D: C6H12O.

Degree of unsaturation is 1. So a ring or a double bond. But we have a double bond from vinyl H, so maybe a double bond.

Looking back at the IR. The broad peak at 3000 is probably O-H. So the compound has an O-H group, which could be an alcohol, phenol, or carboxylic acid.

The two carbonyl peaks: 1700 and 1650. Wait, could it be a conjugated carbonyl? For example, in an ester with an adjacent double bond, like an α,β-unsaturated ester. The 1700 would be the ester carbonyl, and the 1650 could be the conjugated double bond.

Alternatively, if it's a ketone, the 1700 is the ketone, and the 1650 could be an aromatic ring. But I don't see aromatic protons in the NMR description, but the vinyl H are mentioned. So perhaps it's a conjugated system without an aromatic ring.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl H, which are typically in a double bond. So maybe the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOR or similar.

But let's think about the mass spec fragment at m/z 45. Let's consider each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. If the molecular formula is C6H12O2, the molecular weight is (12*6)+(12*1)+(16*2)=72+12+32=116. So the molecular ion would be at m/z 116. But the fragment is at 45. How does that happen? Maybe a loss of a larger fragment, but 45 is a smaller mass. Alternatively, a cleavage producing a smaller ion.

If the structure is CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH3 or something, but that's getting complicated.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight is (6*12)+(10)+(32)=72+10+32=114. So a possible fragment could be 45. Let me think. If the compound is something like an ester with a conjugated double bond, maybe it fragments into a smaller piece.

Wait, perhaps it's an ester with a three-carbon fragment. For example, if the ester is CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2, no, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is (CH2)2COO. Wait, (CH2)2COO would be 58 (12*2 + 4 +12 +16 +16? No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is CH3COOCH2. Let me calculate: CH3COO is 60, but that's too big. Hmm, I'm stuck here.

Another approach: think about the molecular formula. Let's say the structure is an ester of a diol or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment at m/z 45 could be from CH2=CH-O-R. The CH2=CHO- group has a molecular weight of 45 (CH2=CH-O is 45: 12*2 + 2*5 + 16 = 24 +10 +16=50? No, that's 50. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-O- which would be 44 (12*2 + 4 + 16=24 +4 +16=44). So maybe the fragment is CH2=CHO. Hmm, not quite 45.

Wait, maybe it's the (CH2)2O group. But that's 48. So not matching.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is (CH3)2CO, which is 58. No, that's too high.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ketene fragment, but I don't think that's common.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible structures that fit the IR and NMR data. Let's imagine the compound has a conjugated ester group. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOR.

So this would have a double bond (vinyl H), a carbonyl (ester), and if R is an ethyl group, the formula might look like C6H10O2. Let's check: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 would be C5H8O2. Wait, that's C5, but our options are C6. So maybe the R group is CH2CH2, making it C6H10O2. Let me count: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 would be C6H10O2. Yes, that's correct.

So for this structure, the IR would show a broad O-H? Wait, no, because esters don't have O-H groups. Wait, but the IR did show a broad peak at 3000, suggesting O-H. So maybe this is not an ester but a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but carboxylic acids have a broad O-H. If the compound is a carboxylic acid with a conjugated double bond, like CH2=CHCOOH, which is acrylic acid. The formula would be C3H4O2. But our options are all C6. So perhaps it's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like cyclohexene with a substituent. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the compound is a diol with a conjugated carbonyl group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: the presence of a broad peak in IR suggests an O-H. So, if it's an alcohol, then the structure would have an -OH group. But then, the two carbonyl peaks would require another group with two carbonyls. Alternatively, perhaps one is an ester and another is a ketone.

Wait, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, the two peaks could be from two different types of carbonyls. For example, an ester (1700) and an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl (1650). But I'm not certain.

Wait, the broad O-H could also be from a phenol. If the structure is a phenol derivative with a carbonyl group. For example, something like phenyl acetate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Lactones have a cyclic ester structure, so the O-H would be from the ring oxygen. Wait, no, lactones don't have an O-H; they have an ester functional group. So the O-H might come from another part, like a diol.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let's go back to the mass spec.

The fragment at m/z 45. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, then the molecular weight is 114. A fragment at 45 would mean that the rest is 114-45=69. Does that make sense?

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from breaking off a part of the molecule. For example, if the molecule is an ester with a three-carbon fragment, like CH2CH2COO-R.

Wait, let me think: CH2=CHCOO-R (where R is something else). Suppose R is CH2CH2CH3, making the formula C6H10O2. Then, during fragmentation, the molecule might break between the ester oxygen and R, leaving CH2=CHCOO- as a fragment. Wait, that would be a mass of (12*3)+(2*5)+ (16*2) = 36 +10 +32=78, which is higher than 45.

Hmm, maybe the fragment is a smaller part, like the vinyl group. CH2=CH-O would have a molecular weight of 44 (12*2 +4 +16=44). So that's close to 45. Maybe I'm missing something, like a hydrogen or an additional oxygen.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is CH3COO- (which is 60). No, that's higher than 45.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the fragment is an acylium ion. For example, the fragment could be CH3CO+ (43), but that's 43, close to 45. Maybe it's a different group.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass 45 corresponds to (CH3)2O, which is 44. Hmm, no.

Wait, another approach: m/z 45 could be a ketene fragment, but that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91, which is not our case.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me think about the possible structures again. The NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so the compound has a double bond. The IR has two carbonyl peaks and an O-H. So, perhaps the compound has both a carbonyl group and an O-H group, plus a double bond.

So, what compounds have all three? Maybe a cinnamic acid derivative, which has a benzene ring, a double bond, and a carboxylic acid group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the options don't have a benzene ring, perhaps. So maybe it's a simpler compound.

Wait, perhaps it's a diacid or an ester with a double bond. Hmm.

Another thought: The mass spec fragment at m/z 45 could be a small molecule like (CH3)2CO or something. But earlier I thought that's 58. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is (CH2)2O, which is 48. Close but not 45.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is a ketone group. So maybe a (CH2)CO+ group. Let's calculate. (CH2)CO+ would be (12*2) + (16) + 1 (for the charge)? Wait, I don't think charge affects the mass, but I'm not certain. So (CH2)CO is 12*2 + 16 + 1 (H?) No, wait, CO is 12 + 16 =28, and CH2 is 14 (12 + 2). So total would be 28 +14=42. But the fragment is at 45, so that's off by 3. Maybe it's CH2COO- (45: 12*2 + 16 + 16 +1 (from charge?) Hmm, not sure.

Wait, wait, let me think again. The molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2, which has a molecular weight of 114. If a fragment has a mass of 45, the remaining would be 114-45=69. 69 could be a C4H9O group. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a (CH2)2CO+ ion. That would be (12*2) + (2*5) +16 +1 (charge?) = 24 +10 +16=50. No.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck on this. Maybe I should think about the other data points.

The FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, which is O-H. The two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Let's think of a structure with an ester group (1700) and a conjugated double bond (1650). But then where is the O-H? Unless it's a diol or a compound with both an ester and an alcohol group.

Wait, but that would be more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hemiacetal or something else, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, another thought: the O-H could be from a carboxylic acid, which has a broad peak. Then, the two carbonyls could be from the carboxylic acid (around 1700) and another carbonyl group, perhaps from an ester or a ketone. But that would complicate the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the two carbonyl peaks are from conjugated carbonyl groups. Like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, which has a conjugated double bond. The ester carbonyl is at 1700, and the conjugated double bond's stretching could be in the 1650 region.

Wait, but then where's the O-H? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a diol with an ester group. For example, a diol ester, which would have both an ester carbonyl and an O-H from the alcohol groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic hemiacetal, but that's probably not fitting the options.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like methyl acrylate, which is an ester with a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl. Its formula would be C4H6O2. But our options are C6. So perhaps it's a longer chain, like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 (which is C6H10O2). So that's option C.

So, for this structure, the IR would show the ester carbonyl at ~1700, and the conjugated double bond (C=C) around 1650. The O-H in the ester? Wait, no, because esters don't have O-H groups. Wait, but the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which is O-H. So that suggests that the compound has an O-H group, which an ester doesn't. Hmm, so maybe this isn't the right structure.

Wait, maybe the compound is a diol with an ester group. For example, a glycolic ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a beta-diketone, which has two carbonyl groups. But that would require two ketone groups, which maybe would give two peaks around 1700. But the peaks are at 1700 and 1650, so perhaps one is a ketone and another is a conjugated group.

Alternatively, perhaps the two carbonyl peaks are from an ester and an aromatic ring. Wait, but the aromatic ring's C=C would be around 1600, not 1650. Hmm.

Another angle: the broad peak at 3000 cm-1 could be from an alcohol O-H. So the compound has an alcohol and a carbonyl group. Let's think of a structure like a secondary alcohol with a carbonyl, perhaps a ketone.

But then the two carbonyl peaks would require two different carbonyl groups. Hmm, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ketone with an alcohol group. But that also seems complicated.

Alternatively, it could be an acid derivative. Wait, but then the O-H would be from the acid.

Wait, maybe the structure is a phenol with a ketone group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an alpha-hydroxy ester, which would have both an O-H (from the alcohol) and an ester carbonyl. The conjugated double bond would explain the 1650 peak.

Wait, let's imagine the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2-OH. Hmm, but that might not fit well.

Wait, perhaps it's better to get back to the mass spec. If the fragment is at 45, and the options are C6H10O2, which is 114, then a fragment of 45 would imply that another fragment is 114-45=69. So what's a fragment with 69? Maybe a C4H9O group? Or a C3H7O group? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C6H10O2, so maybe the fragment is (CH2)2COO, which is (12*2)+(2*5)+16 +16=24 +10 +32=66, which is not 45.

Wait, perhaps it's a CH3COOCH2CH2 fragment. That would be 45 + 27=72, no.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Let me try to think of possible functional groups that would give the given data.

- Broad O-H in IR: probably an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
- Two carbonyl peaks: maybe two different carbonyl groups or one group with a conjugated system.
- Vinyl H in NMR: double bond.
- Fragment at 45: could be a small ester or something.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the compound is an ester with a vinyl group. For example, ethyl acrylate (CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3). Its molecular formula is C5H8O2. But our options are C6. So maybe it's a longer chain, like propyl something. Hmm.

Wait, but our options are C6H10O2, which would be a longer chain. Let's think: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 is C6H10O2. Yes, that fits option C. So the structure would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Let's check the spectroscopic data.

IR: Ester carbonyl around 1700 cm-1. The conjugated double bond would have a peak around 1650 cm-1. The O-H? Wait, no, because esters don't have O-H. So that doesn't fit the IR data. So perhaps this is not the right structure.

Wait, but the IR shows a broad peak at 3000 which is O-H. So, the compound must have an O-H group. So the structure must include a hydroxyl group.

Hmm, maybe it's a diol ester. For example, something like HOCH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3. But I'm not sure how that would look in IR.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a hemiacetal or something, but that's probably more complicated.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is a beta-keto ester, which has a ketone and an ester group. But that would give two carbonyl peaks, but maybe not a broad O-H.

Wait, but if the compound is a beta-keto acid, then it would have a carboxylic acid group (broad O-H) and a ketone group (1700). The 1650 could be another carbonyl or a conjugated system.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ketone with an alcohol group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like cyclohexenone with a hydroxyl group. But then the IR would show a peak at around 1700 for the ketone, and 1650 for the conjugated double bond. The O-H would be in the broad peak. But the NMR would show vinyl H, which would be protons on the double bond. That could fit.

In that case, the molecular formula would be something like C6H10O, which is option B. Let me calculate: cyclohexenone has the formula C6H10O. If there's a hydroxyl group, that would change the formula. Wait, no, because cyclohexenone is C6H10O. If there's an additional hydroxyl, that would add an O and a H, making it C6H10O2. So that would be option C.

So, the structure would be cyclohexenone with an additional hydroxyl group? But where?

Wait, perhaps it's a dihydroxy cyclohexenone, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is cyclohexanol with a ketone group. That would make it a diketone or something else. Wait, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like benzaldehyde with an ester group, but that brings in aromatic protons, which aren't mentioned in the NMR.

Wait, but the NMR only mentions vinyl H, not aromatic H. So perhaps there are no aromatic protons, so no benzene ring.

Hmm.

Let me think about the possible options again.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation 1. So a ring or a double bond. But the NMR has vinyl H, so a double bond. So the structure could be an ester with a double bond, but then where's the O-H?

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation 2. So either two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. But the presence of vinyl H suggests at least one double bond. So, maybe a ring and a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. But lactones don't have O-H groups, unless it's a diol ester.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ketone with an ester group. For example, a cyclic beta-keto ester. But I'm not sure.

Another idea: the IR peaks at 1700 and 1650 could be from a conjugated carbonyl. For example, in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, the ester carbonyl is at ~1700, and the conjugated double bond is around 1650.

But then why is there a broad O-H in the IR? Because the ester doesn't have O-H. Hmm, that's a problem.

So, maybe the structure is a diol with an ester and a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a malonic ester, which has two carbonyl groups. For example, dimethyl malonate is (CH3CO)2O, which is C4H6O4. But that doesn't fit the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=C(COOH)CH2CH2CH3. But that's a diacid, which would have two O-H groups, but the IR would show two broad peaks? Not sure.

Wait, going back to the mass spec. The fragment at 45 could be a result of the ester group breaking off. For example, if the ester is R-O-CO-O-R', the fragment could be the R'COO group.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is (CH3)COO- (which is 60) or (CH2)COO- (44). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH2=CH-O group. That would be (12*2 +4 +16) =24 +4 +16=44. So 44 is close to 45. Maybe I'm missing a hydrogen or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is CH2=CHOH (45: 12*3 + 6 +16 +1?) 36 +6 +17=60? No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a methyl group attached to something else. But I'm not seeing it.

At this point, maybe I should try to match each option's possible structure with the data.

Option C: C6H10O2.

Possible structure: an ester with a conjugated double bond and an O-H group. Wait, but esters don't have O-H. Unless it's a diol ester, which would have both an ester and an alcohol group.

Alternatively, maybe it's a beta-keto ester with an alcohol group. Hmm.

Another possibility: the structure is a diethyl maleate. Maleate has two double bonds. Let's see: diethyl maleate is (CH2CH2COOCH2CH3)2. Wait, I'm not sure about the structure, but it has two ester groups and a conjugated double bond.

The formula for diethyl maleate would be C10H16O4. That's not matching any of the options, so probably not.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe the compound is a hemiacetal ester, but that's getting too complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond and an O-H. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm going in circles. Let me think about the possible answers. The options are A, B, C, D.

The FTIR has a broad O-H (so likely an alcohol or acid), two carbonyl peaks (maybe ester and another).

The NMR has vinyl H (double bond), so the structure has a double bond.

Mass spec: 45.

Looking for a formula that includes an O-H, a carbonyl, and a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2.

If it's an ester with a double bond and an O-H, perhaps it's a diol ester. For example, something like HOCH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3. But that would have an ester (O-H from the diol) and a conjugated system.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a beta-keto ester with an O-H group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH. That would have an ester group (COO), a double bond (CH2=CH), and an O-H from the alcohol. The formula would be C7H10O3, but that's not one of the options.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is a γ-keto ester, which has a ketone and an ester group. But then where's the O-H?

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a carboxylic acid with a double bond and an ester group. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond and an O-H. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: the presence of a fragment at m/z 45. Let's think of possible esters. For example, methyl propionate is CH3CH2COOCH3, which has a molecular weight of 116. If it fragments, perhaps it breaks at the ester oxygen, giving CH3CH2COO+ (m/z 73) and CH3. That's not matching 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a (CH2)2COO group. Which is 45: (12*2)+(2*5)+16 +16=24+10+32=66. No.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere with this. Let me try to think differently.

Option C has the formula C6H10O2. The molecular weight is 114. So, if a fragment is 45, the remaining would be 114-45=69. What's a possible fragment with 69? Maybe C4H9O group? 4*12=48 +9*1=9 +16=16 → 48+9+16=73. No. Or C3H7O: 36 +7 +16=59. No. Or C5H11O: 60 +11 +16=87. No. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketone, like (CH3)2CO which is 58. No.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a propyl group, but that's 42. No.

Another angle: the IR peaks suggest the presence of an ester (1700) and a conjugated double bond (1650). The O-H could be from a diol or an acid. But in an ester, the O-H would be from the alcohol part, but in an ester, the -OH is part of the ester group and not free. So perhaps the O-H is from another group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a diol ester, which has both an ester group and an alcohol group. For example, HOCH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3. The formula for this would be C6H12O3, which is not an option. So it's not matching.

Wait, but our options don't have O3. So perhaps the O-H is from a different functional group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a beta-keto alcohol. But that's not a common structure.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclic ester with a substituent that includes an O-H. But I'm not sure.

At this point, maybe I should make an educated guess based on the data.

The FTIR suggests O-H (broad), two carbonyls, and NMR shows vinyl H. The mass spec has a peak at 45. If I think of the structure as an ester with a double bond and O-H, but the O-H doesn't fit the ester. So maybe it's a different structure.

Another possibility: the compound is a diester, but again, unsure.

Wait, considering the Mass Spec fragment at 45, maybe the formula is C6H10O2.

If the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OCH3 (but that's not right, because OCH3 would add more oxygens), perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond, but again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from losing a larger group. For example, the molecule could lose a fragment of 69 (114-45=69) and leave 45. What could 69 be? Maybe a benzene ring (78) minus 9? No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, 69 could be (CH2)3COOH, which is 72. No. Hmm.

Another thought: the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. If the structure is an ester with a double bond, perhaps the ester group is CH2=CHCOO- attached to something like CH2CH2CH3. But then, where is the O-H? Not in the ester.

Alternatively, maybe the O-H is from a hydroxyl group somewhere else in the molecule.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the ester doesn't have an O-H, but perhaps the compound is a diol ester, which would have both an ester and a hydroxyl group.

But the molecular formula for a diol ester would have more oxygens. For example, diol ester would be R-O-CO-O-R', which has two ester groups? No, diol esters typically have one ester group and two hydroxyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a diol ester with a double bond. But the molecular formula would have more oxygens, which isn't the case.

Hmm.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about the degrees of unsaturation.

Option C: C6H10O2 → 2 degrees. So either two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

The presence of vinyl H suggests at least one double bond. So perhaps a ring and a double bond.

If the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond, that would fit degrees of unsaturation 2: one ring and one double bond. But lactones don't have O-H groups unless it's a diol, which would change the formula.

Wait, but the IR has a broad O-H, which implies an O-H group. So perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) with an additional hydroxyl group, making it a diol. But that would increase the oxygen count beyond what's in option C.

Hmm.

Perhaps the correct answer is C) C6H10O2. Because it has two degrees of unsaturation, which could account for the double bond and possibly a ring. The ester group would explain the 1700 peak, and the conjugated double bond would explain the 1650. The O-H could be from another group, but I'm not sure how that fits.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a cyclic ester with a ring and a double bond, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the O-H could be from a diol, but that would require more oxygen. So perhaps it's not the case.

In conclusion, based on the data, the presence of O-H (broad peak), two carbonyls (1700 and 1650), vinyl H (double bond), and the mass fragment at 45, the most likely formula is C6H10O2. So the answer should be option C.

The problem involves identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are C₆H₁₂O₂, C₆H₁₀O, C₆H₁₀O₂, and C₆H₁₂O. Here's the analysis:

### FTIR Data:
- **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹**: Indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
- **Two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹**: These are carbonyl (C=O) stretches. The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak suggests an ester or ketone, while the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak could be a conjugated carbonyl or a double bond.

### ¹H NMR Data:
- **Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens**: Indicates the presence of a double bond, likely conjugated with a carbonyl group.

### Mass Spectrometry Data:
- **Fragment peak at m/z = 45**: This suggests a smaller fragment, possibly a methyl or ethyl group attached to an oxygen-containing functional group.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **C₆H₁₂O₂ (Option A)**:
   - Degree of unsaturation: 1 (could be a ring or a double bond).
   - Does not account for the presence of two carbonyl groups or the broad O-H peak. Less likely.

2. **C₆H₁₀O (Option B)**:
   - Degree of unsaturation: 2 (could be a ring and a double bond).
   - Does not explain the two carbonyl peaks in the IR spectrum. Less likely.

3. **C₆H₁₀O₂ (Option C)**:
   - Degree of unsaturation: 2 (could be a ring and a double bond or two double bonds).
   - Matches the data well:
     - The broad O-H peak could arise from an alcohol or carboxylic acid group.
     - The two carbonyl peaks (1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹) could correspond to an ester and a conjugated double bond.
     - The vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggest a double bond, which aligns with the conjugated system.
     - The fragment at m/z = 45 could result from a smaller fragment of the molecule.

4. **C₆H₁₂O (Option D)**:
   - Degree of unsaturation: 1 (could be a ring or a double bond).
   - Does not explain the two carbonyl peaks in the IR spectrum. Less likely.

### Conclusion:
The most consistent explanation for the given data is that the compound has two degrees of unsaturation, a broad O-H group, two carbonyl groups, and a conjugated double bond. These features align with the molecular formula **C₆H₁₀O₂**.
