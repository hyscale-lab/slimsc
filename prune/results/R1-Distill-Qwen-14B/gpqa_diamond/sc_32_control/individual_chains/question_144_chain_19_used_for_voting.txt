Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters, so it's a very small distance, which makes sense for particle decays.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance (or lifetime) is related to the particle's lifetime, which in turn depends on its width. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. But wait, for particle decay, the lifetime τ is related to the decay width Γ. I think the formula is Γ = ħ / τ. Or wait, is it Γ = ħ * (1/τ)? Because Γ is the decay rate, which is ħ times the inverse lifetime. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, wait, no. Let me get this straight. The width Γ is the total decay rate, which has units of energy. The lifetime τ is the mean lifetime, which has units of time. So the relationship is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, particles can also have a production energy E. Oh, right, because when a particle is produced with some energy, its lifetime is also affected by the Lorentz factor. Because from the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is longer than its rest frame lifetime due to time dilation. So the actual lifetime observed is γ times the proper lifetime τ_0. So τ = γ * τ_0.

Hmm, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The mean lifetime τ is the proper time, right? Or is it the dilated time? No, I think the decay width Γ is given in the particle's rest frame. Because Γ is an intrinsic property of the particle. So when the particle is moving, its lifetime from our frame is longer by a factor γ.

So the total lifetime, as observed, is τ = γ * τ_0, where τ_0 is the proper lifetime. But τ_0 is related to Γ via τ_0 = ħ / Γ. So τ = ħ γ / Γ.

But wait, what's the relation between the energy E and the mass m? Because E is the total energy of the particle, so the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. E = γ m c². So solving for gamma, γ = E/(m c²).

Wait, but units matter. Let me make sure. The mass m is given in GeV, so when I compute γ, I have to be careful with units.

Wait, the production energy E_X is 8 GeV. The mass m_X is 1.2 GeV. So E = γ m c², but since both E and m are in GeV, and c is 1 in those units (since E and m are in GeV, and c is about 3e8 m/s), but for the purpose of calculating gamma, perhaps I can just take γ = E / m. Because E in GeV, m in GeV/c², so when you multiply by c², it's GeV (since (GeV/c²) * c² = GeV). So E = γ m c² → gamma = E/(m c²) → but since E and m are in GeV, and c squared is in (m/s)^2, perhaps I need to convert units correctly.

Wait, maybe I can think in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1. But I'm not so sure about the details. Let me see.

Ok, step by step.

First, calculate the decay width Γ in appropriate units. Γ is given as 320 MeV, so that's 0.32 GeV.

So τ_0 (proper lifetime) is ħ / Γ. But wait, ħ has units of GeV·s. Because Planck's constant is 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. So τ_0 = ħ / Γ.

So τ_0 = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) → 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ let's compute that.

6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. Hmm, wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.32 is 32/100, so 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 6.582e-25 * (100/32) = 6.582e-25 * (25/8) ≈ 6.582 * 3.125e-25 → 6.582 *3.125 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds. So τ_0 is about 2.057e-24 seconds.

But wait, the actual lifetime observed is longer due to the particle's motion. The observed lifetime τ = γ * τ_0. So I need to calculate gamma, which is E/(m c²). But wait, with the units as given, perhaps I can ignore c because in natural units where c=1, E = γ m. So gamma would be E/(m) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

So gamma is approximately 6.6667.

Wait, so then τ (observed lifetime) = gamma * τ_0 = 6.6667 * 2.057e-24 s ≈ approximately 1.371e-23 seconds.

Now, the mean decay distance is the speed of the particle multiplied by the lifetime. So distance L = v * τ. But v is approximately c for high-energy particles. So L ≈ c * τ.

But wait, wait, v is beta times c. So beta is v/c. So velocity is beta c. So L = beta c τ.

Hmm, so I need to find beta as well. Beta is v/c. But beta is related to gamma by the equation gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2). So I can compute beta from gamma.

Let me compute beta. Gamma is 6.6667, so gamma squared is 44.4444. So 1 - beta^2 = 1 / gamma² ≈ 1/44.4444 ≈ 0.0225 → beta^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775 → beta ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. sqrt(0.9775) → 0.9887 is approximate. Let me compute 0.9887 squared: 0.9887^2 = (0.98)^2 + (0.0087*2 *0.98) + (0.0087)^2 → 0.9604 + 0.0171 + 0.00007569 → about 0.9775 approximately. So yes, beta is approximately 0.9887.

So now, L = beta c tau. Tau is 1.371e-23 seconds. c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So L ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 1.371e-23 s.

Let me compute that:

3e8 *1.371e-23 = 4.113e-15 meters.

Multiply by 0.9887: 4.113e-15 * 0.9887 ≈ 4.07e-15 meters.

Wait, but wait, let me compute more precisely.

0.9887 * 4.113e-15 = ?

4.113e-15 * 0.9887 → let's compute 4.113 * 0.9887 = ?

4 * 0.9887 = 3.9548

0.113 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.1118 → total ≈ 3.9548 + 0.1118 ≈ 4.0666.

So 4.0666e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m and option C is 5.0223e-15. So our calculation is closer to 4.066e-15, which would match option B.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Let me go through each step again.

Compute τ_0 = ħ / Γ.

ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So τ_0 = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666666...

Compute beta from gamma.

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) → 1 - beta^2 = 1/gamma² → beta^2 = 1 - 1/(44.4444) → 1 - 0.0225 → 0.9775 → beta ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Tau observed is gamma * tau_0 = 6.666666... * 2.056875e-24 ≈ 1.37125e-23 seconds.

Wait, let's compute 6.666666 * 2.056875e-24:

6.666666 * 2.056875 ≈ 6.666666 * 2 = 13.333332, 6.666666 * 0.056875 ≈ 0.37916665 → total ≈ 13.333332 +0.37916665 ≈ 13.712498. So 13.712498e-24 → 1.3712498e-23 seconds.

So L = beta c tau.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So beta c tau = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 1.3712498e-23 s.

Compute 3e8 * 1.37125e-23 = 4.11375e-15 m.

Multiply by 0.9887: 4.11375e-15 * 0.9887 → let's compute:

4 * 0.9887 = 3.9548
0.11375e-15 * 0.9887 → 0.11375 *0.9887 ≈ 0.1123 → so total 3.9548 + 0.1123 = 4.0671 → 4.0671e-15 m.

Wait, but the options have 4.0655e-15 as option B. So perhaps I made an approximation in beta. Let me compute beta more accurately.

Gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.66666667.

So gamma squared is (8/1.2)^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.4444444...

1 - beta^2 = 1 / gamma² → 1/(44.4444444) = 0.0225.

So beta squared is 0.9775.

Compute sqrt(0.9775):

Let me compute this more accurately. Let's find x = sqrt(0.9775).

We can write it as x ≈ 0.9887 is a rough estimate. Let me compute using the Newton-Raphson method.

We know that 0.9887^2 = (approx) 0.9775.

Wait, (0.99)^2 is 0.9801, which is higher than 0.9775. So 0.9887^2 is 0.9775, but let me compute it accurately.

Compute 0.9887 * 0.9887:

0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.

0.98 * 0.0087 = 0.008526.

0.0087 *0.98 = 0.008526.

0.0087 *0.0087 = 0.00007569.

But wait, more accurately:

Let me compute (a + b)^2 where a=0.98, b=0.0087.

(a +b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.

a^2 = 0.9604.

2ab = 2 * 0.98 * 0.0087 = 1.96 * 0.0087 = 0.017052.

b^2 = 0.0087^2 = 0.00007569.

Adding them up: 0.9604 + 0.017052 = 0.977452, plus 0.00007569 is 0.97752769.

So (0.9887)^2 ≈ 0.97752769, which is a bit higher than 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887 minus a tiny bit.

But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, 0.9887 is accurate enough.

So then, L ≈ 4.067e-15 m, which is approximately 4.0655e-15 m as per option B.

Wait, but why is option B 4.0655e-15? That's very close to our calculation. So I think the correct answer is option B.

Another way: perhaps a more precise calculation of beta.

Alternatively, maybe using beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

gamma = 8/(1.2) = 6.66666666667.

gamma squared is (8/1.2)^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.444444444.

So 1/gamma² is 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 1/gamma² is 0.9775.

Taking the square root: sqrt(0.9775) =?

We can compute it more accurately. Let's approximate.

Let me think about it numerically.

We can write that sqrt(0.9775) = x.

We can use the approximation for sqrt(a) near a=1. Let me consider a = 1 - delta, where delta = 0.0225.

Wait, no, 0.9775 = 1 - 0.0225.

So x = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) → using the expansion sqrt(1 - ε) ≈ 1 - ε/2 - ε²/(8) for small ε.

Here, ε = 0.0225, which is about 2.25% so maybe the approximation is okay.

So x ≈ 1 - 0.0225/2 - (0.0225)^2/(8).

Compute 0.0225/2 = 0.01125.

(0.0225)^2 = 0.00050625 → divided by 8 is 0.00006328125.

So x ≈ 1 - 0.01125 - 0.00006328125 = 0.98868671875.

So x ≈ 0.98868671875.

So beta ≈ 0.9886867.

So using beta as approximately 0.9886867.

Now, compute L = beta * c * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s.

Tau is 1.37125e-23 s.

So let me compute beta * c * tau:

beta = 0.9886867.

So 0.9886867 * 3e8 = 2.96606e8 m/s.

Multiply by 1.37125e-23 s → 2.96606e8 * 1.37125e-23 = ?

Compute 2.96606e8 * 1.37125e-23 = (2.96606 * 1.37125) * 1e-15.

Compute 2.96606 * 1.37125.

2 * 1.37125 = 2.7425.

0.96606 * 1.37125 → let me compute that:

0.9 * 1.37125 = 1.234125.

0.06606 *1.37125 ≈ 0.0906.

So total is 1.234125 + 0.0906 = 1.324725.

So total 2.7425 + 1.324725 = 4.067225.

So 4.067225e-15 meters.

Which is approximately 4.067e-15 m. But the option B is 4.0655e-15, which is a bit lower. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 2.96606e8 * 1.37125e-23 more accurately.

Wait, let me compute 2.96606e8 * 1.37125e-23.

= (2.96606 * 1.37125) * 1e-15.

So compute 2.96606 * 1.37125:

Let me do it step by step.

Multiply 2.96606 by 1.37125.

Break it down:

2.96606 * 1 = 2.96606.

2.96606 * 0.3 = 0.889818.

2.96606 * 0.07 = 0.2076242.

2.96606 * 0.001 = 0.00296606.

2.96606 * 0.00025 = 0.000741515.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way.

Alternatively, let me compute 2.96606 × 1.37125:

= 2.96606 × (1 + 0.3 + 0.07 + 0.001 + 0.00025) 

= 2.96606 ×1 + 2.96606×0.3 + 2.96606×0.07 + 2.96606×0.001 + 2.96606×0.00025.

Calculating each part:

2.96606 ×1 = 2.96606

2.96606 ×0.3 = 0.889818

2.96606 ×0.07 = 0.2076242

2.96606 ×0.001 = 0.00296606

2.96606 ×0.00025 = 0.000741515.

Adding all together:

2.96606 + 0.889818 = 3.855878

3.855878 + 0.2076242 = 4.0635022

4.0635022 + 0.00296606 = 4.06646826

4.06646826 + 0.000741515 ≈ 4.067209775.

So the product is approximately 4.067209775.

So 4.067209775e-15 meters is approximately 4.0672e-15 m.

But the option B is 4.0655e-15, which is slightly less. Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of gamma or beta.

Wait, let's recalculate gamma.

E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV.

Gamma = E/(m) → 8 / 1.2 = 6.66666666...

But another approach: perhaps the decay width is given as Γ, which is the total decay width, and the mean lifetime is tau_0 = ħ / (Γ c^2). Wait, no, because when you use natural units, c=1, so tau_0 = ħ / Γ. But perhaps I should include the c factors correctly.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused again. Let me think about the units.

The decay width Γ has units of GeV. The Planck constant ħ has units of GeV·s. So when you compute ħ / Γ, the units are GeV·s / GeV = s. So tau_0 is in seconds. That's correct.

But when calculating gamma as E/(m c^2), because E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c^2, so E/(m c^2) = (GeV) / (GeV/c^2 * c^2) ) → GeV / GeV = dimensionless. So gamma is E/(m c^2) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) → 8/1.2 = 6.6666666667, correct.

So perhaps the earlier calculations are correct, and the answer should be around 4.067e-15 m, which is close to option B (4.0655e-15) but perhaps I made a minor miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that the decay width is given in the rest frame should be adjusted. Wait, no, the decay width is a property of the particle, so it is rest frame.

Another thing: sometimes, the mean decay length is calculated using the velocity in terms of beta c, but perhaps sometimes people use the speed as v = beta c, so L = v * tau.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the proper time is tau_0, and the observed lifetime is gamma tau_0. Then, the distance is L = v gamma tau_0.

Wait, v is beta c, so L = beta c gamma tau_0.

But tau_0 = ħ/(Γ c²), wait, no—tau_0 is tau_0 = ħ/(Γ) when using natural units, but in proper units, perhaps I should be careful.

Wait, perhaps in proper units, since ħ has units of GeV·s, and Gamma is in GeV, tau_0 = ħ / Gamma → which is in seconds.

So tau_0 = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV → as before, 2.056875e-24 s.

Then, the observed lifetime is gamma tau_0 → 6.66666667 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.37125e-23 seconds.

The velocity v is beta c, where beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So beta is sqrt(1 - (1/(6.66666667)^2)).

Which is sqrt(1 - (9/400)) = sqrt(391/400) → sqrt(0.9775).

Which is approximately 0.988687.

So v = 0.988687 * 3e8 m/s.

Wait, but to compute L, it's v multiplied by the observed lifetime τ.

So L = v * tau.

Which is 0.988687 * 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Compute that: 0.988687 *3e8 = 2.966061e8 m/s.

Multiply by 1.37125e-23 s: 2.966061e8 * 1.37125e-23 → 4.067207e-15 m.

So 4.0672e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close. It's possible that using more precise values for ħ would bring it closer.

Wait, the exact value of ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Let me use more decimal places.

So ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So tau_0 = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = ?

6.582 / 0.32 → let's compute that.

0.32 × 20 =6.4 → 6.582 -6.4 =0.182 → 0.182/0.32 =0.56875 → so 20.56875.

So 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s.

Same as before.

So perhaps the minor discrepancy is due to using more precise beta, but it's negligible.

So the correct answer should be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the given parameters: production energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), and decay width \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). The mean decay distance \( L \) is calculated using the relation:

\[
L = \beta c \tau,
\]

where \( \tau \) is the observed lifetime, \( \beta = v/c \), and \( v \) is the velocity of the particle. The observed lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \) by time dilation:

\[
\tau = \gamma \tau_0,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( \tau_0 \) is the proper lifetime, given by:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \)
The reduced Planck constant \( \hbar \) is approximately \( 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \). Using \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \), we find:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor is given by \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \). Substituting \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the observed lifetime \( \tau \)
The observed lifetime is:

\[
\tau = \gamma \tau_0 = 6.6667 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \), we find:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.4444}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9886867.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \beta c \tau,
\]

where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Substituting \( \beta \approx 0.9886867 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau = 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 0.9886867 \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 1.37125 \times 10^{-23}.
\]

First, calculate \( 0.9886867 \times 3 \times 10^8 \):

\[
0.9886867 \times 3 \times 10^8 \approx 2.96606 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

Next, multiply by \( 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \):

\[
L = 2.96606 \times 10^8 \times 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \approx 4.0672 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 6: Match with the closest option
The calculated value \( L \approx 4.0672 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B** \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \). The minor discrepancy is likely due to rounding or approximations in intermediate steps.

**Answer: B**
