Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. They assume the stars radiate as black bodies and want to find the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Hmm, I remember that black body radiation peaks at a wavelength given by Wien's Law. The formula is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (about 2.8977719×10^-3 m·K) and T is the temperature in Kelvin. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because lambda_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

But wait, the radial velocities are given. Oh, but radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh right! The Doppler shift could cause a shift in the observed wavelength. So even if their rest wavelengths are the same, their observed wavelengths might differ because one is moving towards or away from us.

Wait, but the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed lambda_max for both stars is the same. But considering Doppler shift, their actual temperatures might not be the same. Because the observed wavelength is a combination of their intrinsic temperature and their velocity.

Let me think. The Doppler effect formula for wavelength shift is:

lambda_observed = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Wait, no, wait. The formula I remember for velocity causing a shift in wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v/c), but that's for non-relativistic speeds. But when the velocities are a significant fraction of the speed of light, you need to use the relativistic Doppler shift formula. But 700 km/s is like 0.00233c (since c is about 3e5 km/s). So that's a small fraction, but I'm not sure if we can approximate.

Wait, but the problem says that the observed lambda_max are the same for both stars. So maybe their intrinsic temperatures are different, but when considering their velocities, their observed lambda_max comes out the same.

Let me denote Star_1's velocity as v1 and Star_2's as v2. From the question, v1 is 0 and v2 is 700 km/s. So Star_2 is moving towards us (since radial velocity is positive when moving away? Wait, no, depends on the convention. Wait, radial velocity: if it's positive, it's moving away (redshift), negative is moving towards (blueshift). But in the question, Star_1's radial velocity is 0, Star_2's is 700 km/s. So Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, which would cause a redshift. But wait, if both stars have the same observed lambda_max, how does that affect their temperatures?

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let's denote:

For Star_1: observed lambda_max = lambda1_obs = lambda1_rest * (1 + v1/c) [non-relativistic approximation]
But v1 is 0, so lambda1_obs = lambda1_rest.

For Star_2: lambda2_obs = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2/c)

But since lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs, as per the question.

So,

lambda1_rest = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2/c)

But lambda_rest is given by Wien's law: lambda_rest = b / T.

So,

(b / T1) = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Simplify: (1/T1) = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

So, T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)

But wait, v2 is 700 km/s. Let's compute v2/c.

v2 = 700,000 m/s
c = 3e8 m/s

v2/c = 700e3 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.02333.

So, 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.02333.

So T1 = T2 / 1.02333 ≈ T2 * 0.977.

So, Star_1's temperature is about 0.977 times Star_2's temperature.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because Star_2 is moving away, which would cause a redshift in its light. So if its rest frame lambda_max is lower (since T is higher), but because it's moving away, the observed lambda_max would be higher. So if both observed lambda_max are the same, Star_2 must have a higher temperature, but the Doppler shift brings its observed lambda_max up to the same as Star_1.

Wait, maybe I got that reversed. Let me think again.

If a star is moving away (positive radial velocity), its emission is redshifted, so the observed lambda is longer (lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v/c)).

So Star_2 is moving away, so lambda2_obs = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2/c). Star_1 has lambda1_rest = lambda1_obs (since v1=0). So since lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs,

lambda1_rest = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2/c)

But lambda_rest is b/T, so:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

So T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)

So T1 is lower than T2 because denominator is >1. So Star_1 is cooler than Star_2.

Wait, but Star_1 has a larger radius and mass than Star_2. Hmm, but that's probably not directly relevant for the luminosity calculation, but let's make sure.

Now, the luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T^4, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Wait, but to compare the luminosities of the two stars, we can write L1 / L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4)

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2 / R2 )^2 ) * ( T1^4 / T2^4 )

Which simplifies to (1.5)^2 * (T1^4 / T2^4) )

We have T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c), so T1 = T2 * [1/(1.02333)] ≈ T2 * 0.977.

So (T1/T2) = 0.977.

So (T1/T2)^4 is (0.977)^4 ≈ let's compute this.

0.977^2 is approximately 0.9545 (since (1-0.023)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.046 + 0.0005 ≈ 0.9545), then squared again: 0.9545^2 ≈ 0.911.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately. 0.977 * 0.977 = let's compute:

977 * 977: 977^2 = (1000-23)^2 = 1e6 - 2*1000*23 + 23^2 = 1e6 - 46000 + 529 = 954,529. So 977^2 is 954,529. So 0.977^2 = 0.954529.

Then, (0.954529)^2 = ?

Compute 0.954529 * 0.954529. Let's approximate.

0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025.

But more accurately, 0.9545^2 = let's compute:

= (0.95 + 0.0045)^2 ≈ 0.95² + 2*0.95*0.0045 + (0.0045)^2 = 0.9025 + 0.00855 + 0.00002025 ≈ 0.91107.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.911.

So now,

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 0.911 = 2.25 * 0.911 ≈ 2.051.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options are around 2.23, 2.25, 2.32, etc. Hmm, perhaps my approximation is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should compute more accurately the (T1/T2)^4 value. Let me re-calculate.

v2 = 700 km/s = 7e5 m/s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

v2/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.0233333.

So 1 + v2/c = 1.0233333.

So T1 = T2 / 1.0233333 = T2 * (1 / 1.0233333) ≈ T2 * 0.97704.

So T1/T2 = 0.97704.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.97704)^4.

Let me compute 0.97704 squared: 0.97704 * 0.97704.

Compute 0.977 * 0.977:

0.977 * 0.977 = (1 - 0.023)^2 = 1 - 0.046 + 0.000529 = 0.954529.

So 0.977^2 ≈ 0.9545.

Then, (0.9545)^2 = ?

Well, 0.9545 * 0.9545.

Compute as (0.95 + 0.0045)^2 = 0.95^2 + 2*(0.95)(0.0045) + (0.0045)^2 = 0.9025 + 0.00855 + 0.00002025 ≈ 0.91107.

But let me compute it more accurately:

0.9545 * 0.9545:

0.9545 * 0.9545:

Multiply 9545 * 9545, but it's 0.9545 *0.9545 = (0.9 + 0.05 + 0.0045)²? Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, 0.9545 * 0.9545:

= (approx) 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025, but more accurately:

9545 * 9545:

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute this as:

(9545)^2 = (9500 + 45)^2 = 9500² + 2*9500*45 +45² = 90,250,000 + 855,000 + 2,025 = 91,107,025.

So 9545^2 = 91,107,025.

So 0.9545^2 = (9545/10000)^2 = 91,107,025 / 1e8 = 0.91107025.

So (T1/T2)^4 = 0.91107.

So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 0.91107 = 2.25 * 0.91107 ≈ 2.050.

Wait, but that's about 2.05. But the options are around 2.2 something. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift assumption.

Wait, wait, maybe I should use the exact Doppler shift formula instead of the approximation. Because 700 km/s is about 0.23% of the speed of light, which is small, but maybe the non-relativistic approximation isn't sufficient for the ratio.

Wait, the relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

lambda_obs / lambda_rest = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But wait, for a source moving away, the formula is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Wait no, actually the formula can be written as:

lambda_obs / lambda_rest = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But wait, wait, let me get it right. The relativistic Doppler shift when the source is moving away is given by:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, no, I think that's for transverse motion. Wait, maybe it's better to check.

Wait, the general formula is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Wait, no, I think the correct formula for a source moving away (v positive) is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think of another approach.

Alternatively, the relativistic Doppler shift for wavelength is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * ( (1 + v_r/c) ) / sqrt(1 - v_r²/c²) )

Wait, no, that's the exact expression when v_r is the radial velocity. But for v_r much less than c, this can be approximated as:

lambda_obs ≈ lambda_rest (1 + v_r/(2c)) )

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact formula for more accurate calculation.

So let's re-examine the Doppler shift.

Given that Star_2 is moving away with a radial velocity v2 = 700 km/s. So in the frame of the star, the emitted wavelength is lambda_rest. The observed wavelength is lambda_obs.

The exact formula is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But wait, no. Wait, the relativistic Doppler effect for a source moving away (v positive) is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, no, actually, the formula is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (c + v)/(c - v) )

But wait, checking this: when the source moves away, the wavelength is longer (redshifted), so lambda_obs > lambda_rest.

So for Star_2, moving away at v=700 km/s, which is 7e5 m/s.

So,

lambda_obs_Star2 = lambda_rest_Star2 * sqrt( (c + v)/(c - v) )

Wait, but isn't that for the case where the motion is perpendicular? Or is it for radial? Hmm, perhaps I should get the exact formula.

Wait, the correct formula for the Doppler shift when the source is moving directly away is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, no, another source says that the formula is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * ( (1 + (v/c) ) / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) ) )

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation for small velocities, but then the earlier approach may not be precise enough.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is correct, and the problem is that I made an error in the initial calculation. Let's try to recompute more accurately.

Wait, going back. The problem says that the observed lambda_max is the same for both stars. So:

lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2.

But lambda_obs depends on both the rest wavelength and the velocity.

For Star_1: v1 = 0, so lambda_obs_1 = lambda_rest_1 = b / T1.

For Star_2: v2 = 700 km/s, so lambda_obs_2 = lambda_rest_2 * ( (1 + v2/c) ) / sqrt(1 - (v2^2/c^2)) )

Wait, but no, that seems conflicting. Another approach: perhaps the correct Doppler shift formula is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_obs/c) / (1 - v_obs/c) )

Wait, I'm getting confused about the direction. Let me think: if the source is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So, for Star_2 moving away, v is positive.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

lambda_obs_Star2 = lambda_rest_Star2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But lambda_obs_1 equals lambda_obs_2.

So,

lambda_rest_1 = lambda_rest_2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But lambda_rest is b / T, so:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Simplify:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

=> T1 = T2 / sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Which is T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

Ok, now compute v2/c: 700,000 / 3e8 = 7e5 /3e8 = 7/(300) = approx 0.023333.

So,

(1 - v2/c) = 0.976666...

(1 + v2/c) = 1.023333...

So,

(1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) = (0.976666)/(1.023333) ≈ 0.954529.

So sqrt(0.954529) ≈ 0.977.

So T1 = T2 * 0.977.

Wait, same as before. So T1 ≈ 0.977 * T2.

So then, L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

We have R1 = 1.5 R2, so (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

T1/T2 = 0.977, so (T1/T2)^4 = (0.977)^4.

As before, 0.977^2 = 0.9545, then squared again gives approx 0.911.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.911 ≈ 2.05.

Wait, but the options are around 2.23 or so. So perhaps my approximation is wrong. Or wait, perhaps I should compute (T1/T2)^4 more accurately.

Let me compute 0.977^4.

Compute 0.977^2 first.

0.977 * 0.977:

Let me compute it accurately.

977 * 977 = ?

Compute 977 * 977:

= (1000 - 23) * (1000 - 23) = 1000² - 2*1000*23 + 23² = 1,000,000 - 46,000 + 529 = 954,529.

So 0.977^2 = 0.954529.

Now compute (0.954529)^2.

So 0.954529 * 0.954529.

Let me compute this accurately.

Compute 0.9545 * 0.9545.

Hmm, perhaps I can compute it as (0.95 + 0.0045)^2.

= 0.95² + 2*0.95*0.0045 + 0.0045².

0.95² = 0.9025.

2*0.95 *0.0045 = 0.95 *0.009 = 0.00855.

0.0045^2 = 0.00002025.

Adding these up: 0.9025 + 0.00855 = 0.91105 + 0.00002025 = 0.91107025.

So (0.954529)^2 ≈ 0.91107025.

So (T1/T2)^4 = 0.91107.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.91107 ≈ 2.25 * 0.91107.

Compute 2.25 * 0.91107.

Well, 2 * 0.91107 = 1.82214.

0.25 * 0.91107 = 0.2277675.

Adding them: 1.82214 + 0.2277675 = 2.0499075.

So approximately 2.05.

But the options don't have 2.05. The closest option is A) ~2.25, which is larger than my calculation. But that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift approach. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: maybe the Doppler shift doesn't affect the peak wavelength because the question says the observed lambda_max is the same. Wait, but the observed lambda_max is different due to Doppler shift, but the problem states that they are the same. So my initial approach must be correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed temperature, so the effective temperature used in the luminosity calculation is different.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, the stars are considered as black bodies, so their luminosities are based on their actual temperatures and sizes, not the observed. Wait, no, because the observed wavelength depends on the Doppler shift, which affects the temperature. So perhaps I should include the Doppler shift correctly.

Wait, maybe I got the Doppler formula wrong. Let's double-check.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v/c)

But this is a non-relativistic approximation. The exact relativistic formula is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Hmm, but for v=700 km/s, which is about 0.23% of c, the difference between the two formulas is small, but perhaps using the exact formula would give a more accurate result.

Let me compute using the exact formula.

v2 =700e3 m/s.

c =3e8 m/s.

So,

(1 + v2/c) = 1 + 700e3/(3e8) = 1 + 7/300 ≈ 1.023333.

(1 - v2/c) = 1 - 7/300 ≈ 0.9766667.

So,

sqrt( (1.023333)/(0.9766667) ) = sqrt( 1.04798 ) ≈ 1.02366.

So,

lambda_obs_Star2 = lambda_rest_Star2 * 1.02366.

Since lambda_obs_Star1 = lambda_rest_Star1 (no velocity).

And lambda_obs_Star1 = lambda_obs_Star2.

So,

lambda_rest_Star1 = lambda_rest_Star2 * 1.02366.

But lambda_rest is b / T, so:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * 1.02366.

So,

1/T1 = 1.02366/T2.

So,

T1 = T2 / 1.02366 ≈ 0.97666 * T2.

So,

(T1/T2) = 0.97666.

Then,

(T1/T2)^4 = (0.97666)^4.

Compute this:

0.97666^2 = (approx) 0.9539.

0.9539^2 is approximately 0.9098.

So,

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 0.9098 = 2.25 * 0.9098 ≈ 2.04.

Hmm, about the same as before. So about 2.04, but the options are all higher than 2.23. Wait, that doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the Doppler shift isn't affecting the peak wavelength in the way I thought. Because the peak wavelength depends on the temperature, and the observed temperature is affected by the Doppler shift.

Wait, but in the earlier approach, the observed lambda_max is the same, which implies that the intrinsic temperatures are different, adjusted by the Doppler shift.

Wait, perhaps I should compute T1 and T2 correctly.

Wait, another approach: using the exact Doppler shift.

lambda_obs_Star1 = lambda_rest_Star1.

lambda_obs_Star2 = lambda_rest_Star2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Since lambda_obs_Star1 = lambda_obs_Star2,

lambda_rest_Star1 = lambda_rest_Star2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Which implies,

lambda_rest_Star1 / lambda_rest_Star2 = sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But lambda_rest is b/T, so,

(T2 / T1) = sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Taking reciprocal,

T1 / T2 = sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

So,

(T1 / T2) = sqrt( (1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c) )

Which is,

(T1 / T2) = sqrt( (1 - 700e3/(3e8)) / (1 + 700e3/(3e8)) )

Compute this:

700e3 = 7e5 m/s.

v2/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/300 ≈ 0.0233333.

So,

(1 - 0.0233333) = 0.9766667.

(1 + 0.0233333) = 1.0233333.

So,

(0.9766667)/(1.0233333) ≈ 0.954529.

sqrt(0.954529) ≈ 0.97704.

So,

T1 = 0.97704 * T2.

So, (T1/T2) = 0.97704.

Which brings us back to the same point. So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.97704)^4 ≈ 0.91107.

So,

L1 / L2 = (1.5)^2 * 0.91107 ≈ 2.25 * 0.91107 ≈ 2.05.

But none of the options are near 2.05. The options are 2.23, 2.25, 2.32, etc. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that the stars are moving in such a way that their observed peak wavelengths are the same. But perhaps the velocities are causing a blueshift, and I got the directions wrong. Let me think again.

Radial velocity: if a star is moving away, its light is redshifted (lambda_obs > lambda_rest). If moving towards us, blueshifted (lambda_obs < lambda_rest).

In the problem, Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. So Star_2 is moving away, so its lambda_obs is longer than its rest lambda. But the problem says that both have the same observed lambda_max. So to have the same observed lambda, Star_2 must have a shorter rest lambda.

Which implies that Star_2's T is higher. Because lambda_rest = b/T. So if Star_2's lambda_rest is smaller, T is higher.

So, let's recompute the Doppler shift correctly.

Hmm, perhaps I should not have used the non-relativistic Doppler shift but the exact formula.

Wait, let's compute the exact Doppler shift factor.

v2 = 700 km/s = 7e5 m/s.

So,

sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) ) = sqrt( (1 + 7e5/(3e8)) / (1 - 7e5/(3e8)) )

Compute numerator and denominator inside sqrt:

Numerator: 1 + (7e5)/(3e8) = 1 + (7/300) ≈ 1.0233333.

Denominator: 1 - (7/300) ≈ 0.9766667.

So,

(1.0233333)/(0.9766667) ≈ 1.04798.

sqrt(1.04798) ≈ 1.02366.

So,

lambda_obs_Star2 = lambda_rest_Star2 * 1.02366.

But lambda_obs_Star1 = lambda_rest_Star1 = lambda_rest_Star2 * 1.02366.

So,

lambda_rest_Star1 = lambda_rest_Star2 * 1.02366.

But lambda_rest is b / T, so:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * 1.02366.

So,

1/T1 = 1.02366 / T2.

=> T1 = T2 / 1.02366 ≈ 0.97666 * T2.

Which is the same as before.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4) = (2.25) * (0.97666^4 )

Compute 0.97666^4.

0.97666^2 = (approx) 0.9539.

0.9539^2 ≈ 0.9098.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9098 ≈ 2.049.

Which is about 2.05.

But the options are higher. Wait, but perhaps I messed up the calculation of (T1/T2)^4.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (0.97666)^4 more accurately.

Compute 0.97666^2:

0.97666 * 0.97666.

Let me compute it precisely.

Compute 97666 * 97666.

Wait, that's a big number, but perhaps I can compute it as:

(0.97666)^2 = ?

Alternatively, perhaps using logarithms.

log(0.97666) ≈ ln(0.97666) ≈ -0.0237.

So,

(ln(0.97666))^2 ≈ (-0.0237)^2 ≈ 0.000561.

So,

exp(2 * ln(0.97666)) = exp(-0.0474) ≈ 0.9539.

Which matches earlier.

Then, (0.9539)^2 = ?

ln(0.9539) ≈ -0.047, so 0.9539^2 = exp(-0.094) ≈ 0.910.

So, 0.97666^4 ≈ 0.910.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.910 ≈ 2.0475.

Again, about 2.05.

Hmm, but the options are all around 2.2, 2.3.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement says that Star_1's radial velocity is 0, and Star_2's is 700 km/s, but perhaps I should consider that Star_1 is moving towards us or something else.

Wait, the problem says radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. So Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s. So the exact same calculation as before.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the Doppler shift affects the observed temperature, but the Stefan-Boltzmann law uses the observed temperature? No, no, the Stefan-Boltzmann law uses the actual temperature of the star, not the observed one.

Wait, but the observed temperature is T_obs = T_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c) ) ), right? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the Doppler effect affects the observed flux, but not the intrinsic luminosity.

Wait, the luminosity is intrinsic and depends on the star's actual T and R. The observed flux would be affected by Doppler effects, but the question is about the computed luminosity based on their black body radiation. So the calculation would be based on their actual T, not the observed T.

So, perhaps the earlier approach is correct, and the problem is that the options are wrong, but that's unlikely.

Wait, but let's think again: perhaps the problem uses the observed T to compute the luminosity, but that doesn't make sense because the observed T would be lower.

Wait, no, the problem states that the astronomers computed the luminosity based on their black body radiation. So they would use the actual T and R, not the observed.

But then, how would they find the actual T? Because the observed wavelength is the same, but the actual T is different due to Doppler shift.

Hmm, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think differently.

Alternative approach: compute the luminosity ratio without considering Doppler shift.

Wait, what if the stars have the same observed T because Doppler shift adjusts for it? No, no, because Doppler shift would change the observed wavelength, which relates to T. So the actual T must be adjusted accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is stating that the stars have the same observed brightness in the same band, but that's not the case here. The question says the wavelength at which they appear brightest is the same, which relates to the observed T.

Wait, I think the initial approach is correct, but perhaps I'm making a miscalculation in (T1/T2)^4.

Let me compute 0.97704^4 more accurately.

Compute 0.97704^2: 0.97704 * 0.97704.

Let me compute 0.97704 * 0.97704.

Well,

= (0.97 + 0.00704)^2

= 0.97^2 + 2 * 0.97 * 0.00704 + (0.00704)^2

= 0.9409 + 0.0137344 + 0.0000495

= 0.9409 + 0.0137344 = 0.9546344 + 0.0000495 ≈ 0.9546839.

So, 0.97704^2 ≈ 0.9546839.

Now, square that to get the fourth power.

0.9546839^2.

= (approx) 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025, but more accurately.

Compute 0.9546839 * 0.9546839:

Break it down as (0.95 + 0.0046839)^2.

= 0.95^2 + 2 * 0.95 * 0.0046839 + (0.0046839)^2.

0.95^2 = 0.9025.

2 * 0.95 * 0.0046839 = 1.9 * 0.0046839 ≈ 0.009000.

(0.0046839)^2 ≈ 0.00002193.

So,

0.9025 + 0.009000 = 0.9115 + 0.00002193 ≈ 0.911522.

So,

0.97704^4 ≈ 0.911522.

Thus, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 0.911522 = 2.25 * 0.911522 ≈ 2.049.

So about 2.05.

But the options are all around 2.23 or higher. So I'm not matching any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift approach. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: perhaps the Doppler shift affects the flux, but the question asks for the luminosity, not the flux. Luminosity is intrinsic, but the observed flux depends on distance and Doppler.

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention distance, so perhaps the stars are at the same distance, making flux proportional to L.

Alternatively, perhaps the observed flux affects the calculation, but the problem says they computed the luminosity, so perhaps it's based on the observed flux.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the radial velocities affect the observed luminosity because the flux is Doppler shifted, but the question says they computed the luminosity based on black body radiation, which would not account for the Doppler shift. So perhaps the Doppler shift isn't affecting the luminosity calculation, only the observed wavelength.

Wait, but how would they compute the luminosity? The luminosity depends on R and T.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler shift isn't used in calculating L, but only in determining the observed wavelength. So, the fact that the observed lambda_max are the same tells us that the intrinsic temperatures are adjusted based on Doppler, but when computing L, you use the actual T.

Wait, but according to the problem, the astronomers computed the luminosity based on black body radiation. So they would have to know T, which is determined from the observed lambda_max and the Doppler shift.

So, the observed lambda_max is the same, but the actual T is different because of the Doppler shift.

So, for Star_1:

lambda_obs_1 = lambda_rest_1 = b/T1.

For Star_2:

lambda_obs_2 = lambda_rest_2 * Doppler factor.

Since lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2,

lambda_rest_1 = lambda_rest_2 * Doppler factor.

But lambda_rest is b/T, so:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * Doppler factor.

Thus, T1 = T2 / Doppler factor.

Which brings us back to the same calculation.

So, the luminosity ratio is (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

Given R1 =1.5 R2,

(R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

T1 = T2 * [Doppler factor inverse].

So, let's compute the Doppler factor using the exact formula.

v2 =700,000 m/s.

c=3e8 m/s.

Doppler factor = sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

= sqrt( (1 + 700e3/3e8) / (1 - 700e3/3e8) )

= sqrt( (1 + 7/300) / (1 - 7/300) )

= sqrt( (307/300) / (293/300) )

= sqrt( 307/293 ) ≈ sqrt(1.04778) ≈ 1.0235.

So,

Doppler factor ≈ 1.0235.

Thus,

T1 = T2 / 1.0235 ≈ 0.9767 * T2.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.9767)^4 ≈ ?

0.9767 squared is:

0.9767^2 ≈ 0.9541.

Then, 0.9541 squared is:

0.9541^2 ≈ 0.9101.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9101 ≈ 2.047.

Still about 2.05.

But the options are all higher. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler factor is applied differently. Maybe I should have used (1 + v/c) for Star_2 since it's moving away, increasing the observed wavelength.

Wait, in the formula, lambda_obs = lambda_rest * Doppler factor.

So, for Star_2, lambda_obs = lambda_rest_2 * Doppler factor.

But lambda_obs_1 is lambda_rest_1.

Setting them equal:

lambda_rest_1 = lambda_rest_2 * Doppler factor.

Which gives:

T1 = T2 / Doppler factor.

Wait, but Doppler factor = 1.0235, which makes T1 = T2 * 0.9767.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, but the luminosity is based on the intrinsic T and R.

Another approach: perhaps the observed flux F is related to the luminosity L by F = L/(4πd²) * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity. Because the Doppler effect causes a (1 + v/c) factor in flux for non-relativistic speeds.

But I'm not certain about that. Alternatively, the flux could be affected by (1 + v/c) due to the Doppler effect.

But the question says that the luminosity is computed based on black body radiation, which depends on R and T. So perhaps the Doppler shift only affects the observed T, which is used to compute the intrinsic T.

So, perhaps the initial approach is correct, and the answer is about 2.05, but none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the Doppler shift correctly. Let me think: if Star_2 is moving away, its observed temperature is lower than its actual temperature. So perhaps in the calculation of luminosity, the actual T is higher.

Wait, because when a star moves away, its observed T is T_actual * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ), as per the earlier calculation.

Wait, from before, T_obs = T_actual * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So, T_obs_Star2 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

But for both stars, T_obs is the same because their observed lambda_max are the same.

So,

T_obs_Star1 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - 0)/(1 + 0) ) = T1.

T_obs_Star2 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Setting them equal:

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Which is the same as before.

So, same result.

Hmm, perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (0.97704)^4 more accurately.

0.97704^2 = 0.9546839.

0.9546839^2 = ?

Compute 0.9546839 * 0.9546839.

Let me compute this as:

0.9546839 * 0.9546839.

First, compute 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025.

Then, compute cross terms.

But perhaps it's easier to compute:

(0.9546839)^2 = ?

Using a calculator, 0.9546839 * 0.9546839 ≈ 0.9111.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9111.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9111 ≈ 2.049.

Still about 2.05.

But the options are all higher, so perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler shift is affecting the radius as well? No, radius is an intrinsic property, not affected by the star's motion.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the answer is around 2.05, but that's not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: perhaps the Doppler shift isn't considered, and the luminosity ratio is simply (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4, assuming same T.

But that would give L1/L2 = (2.25) * (1) = 2.25, which is option A.

But the problem states that the observed lambda_max are the same, which would imply that the temperatures are adjusted due to Doppler shift, so that approach neglects the Doppler effect, which is incorrect.

Hmm, but perhaps the question assumes that the Doppler shift is negligible, and thus T1 = T2.

In that case,

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 1 = 2.25, which is option A.

But according to the problem statement, the observed lambda_max are the same, which would require considering the Doppler shift. So that approach is perhaps wrong.

But perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the Doppler shift, given that 700 km/s is a small velocity.

But then, the correct approach would be to compute without considering the Doppler shift, which gives 2.25, option A.

But I'm not sure. The problem explicitly states that the observed lambda_max are the same, so ignoring Doppler would be against the problem's statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to say that the intrinsic lambda_max are the same, so T1 = T2. Then, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, option A.

But that's not what the problem says. The problem says the observed wavelengths are the same.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem meant that the stars have the same peak wavelengths in their rest frames, which would imply T1 = T2. But that's not what the question states.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended that the Doppler shift is not considered, and the observed lambda_max are same in their rest frames, implying same T. But that would make the problem easier, and the answer option A.

But the given options are up to 2.35, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1.5)^2 * (0.97704)^4.

Let me compute 1.5^2 = 2.25.

Compute 0.97704^4:

As before, 0.97704^2 ≈ 0.9546839.

0.9546839^2 = 0.91094.

So,

2.25 * 0.91094 = 2.25 * 0.91094 ≈ 2.049.

Hmm, no.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift factor. Because when the source is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, which suggests a lower T. But since both observed lambda_max are the same, Star_2's actual T must be higher to compensate.

Wait, let's think again.

lambda_obs_1 = lambda_rest_1.

lambda_obs_2 = lambda_rest_2 * Doppler factor.

But lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2.

So,

lambda_rest_1 = lambda_rest_2 * Doppler factor.

lambda_rest = b/T, so,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * Doppler factor.

Thus, T1 = T2 / Doppler factor.

So, if the Doppler factor is greater than 1, T1 is less than T2.

So, the ratio T1/T2 is less than 1.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

Which is 2.25 * (T1/T2)^4.

But T1/T2 is 1/Doppler factor, which is sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ).

Hmm, I think I'm going in circles.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the luminosity ratio correctly using the exact Doppler factor and precise calculations.

Let me try that.

v2 =700,000 m/s.

c=3e8 m/s.

Compute Doppler factor = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

= sqrt( (1 + 700e3/3e8)/(1 - 700e3/3e8) )

= sqrt( (1 + 7/300)/(1 - 7/300) )

= sqrt( (307/300)/(293/300) )

= sqrt( 307/293 ) ≈ sqrt(1.04778) ≈ 1.0235.

So,

lambda_rest_1 = lambda_rest_2 * 1.0235.

So,

T1 = T2 / 1.0235 ≈ 0.97666 * T2.

So,

(T1/T2) = 0.97666.

Compute (T1/T2)^4:

0.97666^4.

Compute step by step:

0.97666^2:

= 0.97666 * 0.97666.

Let me compute:

= (0.97 + 0.00666)^2.

= 0.97² + 2*0.97*0.00666 + 0.00666².

= 0.9409 + 0.0130632 + 0.000044356 ≈ 0.954007556.

Now, square that to get the fourth power:

0.954007556^2.

= (approx) 0.954^2 = (0.95 + 0.004)^2 = 0.95² + 2*0.95*0.004 + 0.004² = 0.9025 + 0.0076 + 0.000016 = 0.910116.

But more accurately:

Compute 0.954007556 * 0.954007556.

Hmm, perhaps using a calculator approach:

= 0.954007556 * 0.954007556.

Let me compute:

0.954 * 0.954 = 0.910116.

The exact value would be slightly higher because 0.954007556 is a bit more than 0.954.

But for our purposes, let's say it's approximately 0.910.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.910.

Thus,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.910 ≈ 2.0475.

Still around 2.05.

But none of the options match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, and thus the luminosity calculation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift and assume T1 = T2. Then,

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, which is option A.

But that would be incorrect because the problem states that the observed lambda_max are the same, which requires considering Doppler shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be option D) ~2.23, which is the square root of 5, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Doppler factor. Let me compute sqrt(307/293) more accurately.

307/293 = 1.04778.

sqrt(1.04778) = approximately 1.0235.

Yes.

Hmm, perhaps I should just proceed and select the closest option, but my calculation doesn't match any. Alternatively, perhaps the intended approach was to ignore the Doppler shift, leading to option A.

But I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option D) ~2.23.

Wait, but 2.23 is approximately the square of 1.5 times the fourth root of 0.911.

Wait, 1.5^2 is 2.25, and 0.911 is about 0.91, so 2.25 * 0.91 ≈ 2.047. So not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach and the correct answer is option B) ~2.32.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value using precise numbers.

Compute 0.97704^4: exact value.

0.97704^2 = ?

Compute 97704 * 97704.

Wait, 97704 * 97704 = ?

But perhaps it's easier to use a calculator approach.

But without a calculator, perhaps I can compute 0.977^4 as follows:

0.977^2 = 0.954529.

0.954529^2 = ?

Compute 0.954529 * 0.954529.

Approximate as:

(0.95 + 0.004529)^2 = 0.95^2 + 2*0.95*0.004529 + (0.004529)^2.

= 0.9025 + 0.0085835 + 0.00002053.

= 0.9025 + 0.0085835 = 0.9110835 + 0.00002053 ≈ 0.911104.

So,

0.977^4 ≈ 0.911104.

Thus,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.911104 ≈ 2.049986.

So approximately 2.05.

But the options don't include 2.05. So perhaps the problem expects us to approximate the Doppler shift as (1 + v/c), leading to a larger T ratio.

Wait, let me try using the non-relativistic Doppler shift, which is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v/c).

So,

lambda_obs_1 = lambda_rest_1.

lambda_obs_2 = lambda_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c).

Set equal:

lambda_rest_1 = lambda_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c).

Which gives:

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c).

v2/c = 700e3 / 3e8 = 7e5/3e8 = 7/300 ≈0.02333.

So,

1 + v2/c = 1.02333.

Thus,

T1 = T2 / 1.02333 ≈ 0.97704 * T2.

Which is the same as earlier.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 = 0.97704^4 ≈0.911.

Thus, L1/L2=2.25 *0.911= 2.049.

Same result.

But the options don't match.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option D) ~2.23. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1.5)^2 * (0.97704)^4 using more precise values.

Compute 1.5^2 = 2.25.

Compute 0.97704^4:

As above, approximately 0.911.

So,

2.25 * 0.911 = 2.04975.

Still about 2.05.

So, given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option B) ~2.32.

But I'm not seeing how. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the Doppler shift affects the radius as well, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem has a typo and the velocities are reversed. Like, Star_1 has velocity 700 and Star_2 has 0. Then, perhaps the calculation would give a higher ratio.

But the question states that Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to conclude that the answer is approximately 2.05, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option D) ~2.23.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the Doppler factor.

Wait, v2 = 700 km/s =7e5 m/s.

Doppler factor = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

= sqrt( (1 +7e5/(3e8)) / (1 -7e5/(3e8)) )

= sqrt( (307/300) / (293/300) )

= sqrt(307/293) = sqrt(1.04778) ≈1.0235.

So,

T1 = T2 / 1.0235 = 0.97666 * T2.

Thus,

(T1/T2) = 0.97666.

Compute (0.97666)^4.

I think I did that correctly, but perhaps I should compute it using logarithms.

ln(0.97666) = approx -0.02375.

So,

ln(0.97666)^4 = 4 * (-0.02375) = -0.095.

e^-0.095 ≈ 0.909.

Thus,

L1/L2=2.25 *0.909≈2.04.

Same as before.

So, I don't see a way to reach the options provided. Perhaps the intended answer is option D) ~2.23, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift and compute L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, option A.

But that would ignore the Doppler effect, which the problem statement says is considered.

Hmm.

After all this, I think the correct answer based on the calculations is approximately 2.05, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option D) ~2.23.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the luminosity ratio of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2 and a mass 1.5 times greater. The observed wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same, and Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, while Star_1 has no radial velocity. The goal is to compute the factor by which Star_1's luminosity exceeds Star_2's.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Wien's Law and Doppler Shift**:
   - The observed wavelength at which a star appears brightest is related to its temperature by Wien's Law:  
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \frac{b}{T}
     \]
     where \(b\) is Wien's displacement constant.  
   - For Star_1 (\(v_1 = 0\)), the observed wavelength is equal to its rest wavelength:  
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \frac{b}{T_1}.
     \]
   - For Star_2 (\(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\)), the observed wavelength is redshifted due to its motion away from the observer:  
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}.
     \]
   - Since \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\), equating the two expressions gives:  
     \[
     \frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}.
     \]
     Simplifying,  
     \[
     T_1 = T_2 \sqrt{\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}.
     \]

2. **Temperature Ratio**:
   - Substituting \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\),  
     \[
     \frac{v_2}{c} = \frac{700 \times 10^3}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 0.02333.
     \]
   - The temperature ratio becomes:  
     \[
     \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - 0.02333}{1 + 0.02333}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.97667}{1.02333}} \approx \sqrt{0.9545} \approx 0.977.
     \]

3. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   - The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:  
     \[
     L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4.
     \]
     The ratio of the luminosities is:  
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4.
     \]
   - Given \(R_1 = 1.5 \, R_2\),  
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.
     \]
   - Using \(\frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx 0.977\),  
     \[
     \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (0.977)^4 \approx 0.911.
     \]
   - Therefore,  
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times 0.911 \approx 2.05.
     \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated luminosity ratio (\(\approx 2.05\)) does not match any of the provided options (\(2.23, 2.25, 2.32, 2.35\)).  
   - The closest option is **D) ~2.23**, which may reflect an approximation or rounding in the problem setup.
