Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, let me parse that. So, the structure has a cyclohexane ring attached to another cyclohexane ring, with a hydroxymethyl group attached. And there's an aldehyde group on the cyclohexane part. So, I think the structure is something like a cyclohexane ring (let's say the main ring) with a substituent that's another cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH group, and also an aldehyde group (CHO) attached to the main ring.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw it out. So the main ring is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning there's a CHO group on it. Then, attached to that same carbon (the one with the aldehyde) is a CH(OH) group, which is connected to a cyclohexane. Or wait, maybe not the same carbon. Let me think again.

Wait, the compound is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The numbering would start at the aldehyde group, I suppose. So the aldehyde is on carbon 1. Then, the cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl is attached to that same carbon. So the structure is cyclohexane with a CH2(OH) attached, and that CH2 is connected to another cyclohexane ring. Wait, no, maybe:

Wait, the substituents are on the same carbon as the aldehyde. So, the main ring is cyclohexane, and on carbon 1 of that ring (the aldehyde carbon), there's a CH2 group that's connected to a cyclohexyl group and also has an OH group. So the structure is:

- Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde: a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group attached to one carbon.
- On that same carbon, there's a CH(OH) group which is connected to a cyclohexane ring. So the structure is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl)methyl attached to the aldehyde carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclohexane ring where one of the carbons is substituted with a group that is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, and that same carbon is also attached to an aldehyde group. Hmm, maybe the carbon with the aldehyde has two substituents: a hydroxymethyl group (which is attached to the cyclohexane) and the cyclohexane ring?

Wait, maybe I should look at the IUPAC name again. The main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is cyclohexane with a carbaldehyde group (CHO). The substituent is at position 1: cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So, the structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde where the aldehyde carbon is attached to a hydroxymethyl group that's also attached to a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, that would mean the structure is: the main ring is cyclohexane, with the aldehyde on one carbon. That same carbon also has a CH(OH) group attached to a cyclohexane. So, the structure is something like:

CHO
|
C connected to cyclohexane ring and CH(OH)cyclohexyl.

Wait, maybe this is getting too confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the target molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent which is a CH2(OH) group, and that same CH2 is connected to another cyclohexane ring, and the same carbon where the aldehyde is attached.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to think about the synthesis steps. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So that's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond to a CH2 group). So, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

Wait, wait, no: ethynyl is -C≡CH, so ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡CH substituent. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2? Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a substituent of -C≡CH.

So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Wait, no, ethynyl is R-C≡CH, so in ethynylcyclohexane, the substituent would be directly attached as R-C≡CH, so the structure is cyclohexane attached directly to a carbon that's triple-bonded to another CH group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of ethynylcyclohexane as cyclohexane with a propargyl group (CH2-C≡CH) attached.

But the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, so cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (-C≡CH) attached.

Now, the target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, what do I need to do to get from ethynylcyclohexane to that target?

Let me think about the steps needed. I need to introduce an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane ring.

So, perhaps the synthesis involves functional group transformations, maybe some cyclopropane opening or other ring-forming reactions.

Wait, wait. Let me think about possible reactions.

First, starting from ethynylcyclohexane. Let's see, what can we do with an alkyne substituent on a ring?

One possibility is to convert the triple bond into a carbonyl group. Maybe via oxymercuration or hydroxylation, but that might lead to a ketone. Alternatively, using a dihydroxylation to make a diol, but that would give us a vicinal diol.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde group. How can we introduce an aldehyde?

Another approach: perhaps we can perform a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a hydroxymethyl connected to another cyclohexane. So maybe we can form a ring through some kind of cycloaddition, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne can be converted into a carbonyl group. So, the triple bond (ethynyl group) can be turned into a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, here's an idea: in the presence of a strong base, like NaNH2, and an alkylating agent, perhaps we can perform a deprotonation and alkylation. But wait, ethynylcyclohexane's triple bond is sp-hybridized, so it's quite acidic. The protons on the triple bond (the ones on CH in -C≡CH) are acidic and can be deprotonated.

So, if we treat ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2 (a strong base), it would deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide ion. Then, maybe alkylate it with something. Option A starts with NaNH2 and methyl chloride, so perhaps that's the case.

So, step 1: deprotonate the alkyne to form the acetylide, then treat with methyl chloride (CH3Cl) to perform an alkylation. The acetylide would attack the methyl chloride, adding a methyl group to the alkyne.

Wait, but wait. Acetylide is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So, adding methyl chloride would give us a methyl group added to the alkyne.

So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-Me? Or perhaps it's CH2 added to each end.

Wait, no, wait. The alkyne is -C≡CH. Deprotonating gives -C≡C^−. Adding CH3Cl would give -C≡C-CH2Cl? No, wait, maybe the acetylide attacks CH3Cl, so the triple bond would have a CH3 group added.

Wait, the reaction of an acetylide with an alkyl halide would typically add the R group to the sp-hybrid carbon. So, for example, HC≡C-R would become RC≡C-R'.

Wait, perhaps in this case, the acetylide (from ethynylcyclohexane) would be CH2-C≡C^−. Then, adding CH3Cl would give CH2-C≡C-CH2Cl? Or is it CH2-C≡C-CH3?

Wait, no. Let's think again. The starting material is cyclohexane with a substituent of -C≡CH. When deprotonated, it becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C^−. Then, treating with methyl chloride (CH3Cl), the acetylide would attack the methyl group, so the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a propyl group attached via a triple bond. Hmm, but that's not necessarily the case. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is at the end, so the alkylation would add a methyl group to the sp-hybrid carbon.

So, the triple bond is between two carbons: one attached to cyclohexane (let's call it C1) and the other (C2) with a hydrogen (since it's ethynyl: C1≡C2H). Deprotonating C2H gives C1≡C2^−. Alkylation would add CH3 to C2, making C1≡C2CH3.

So, the product after step 1 would be cyclohexane attached to a propyne group (C≡CCH3). So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting this wrong. Or perhaps I should think about the actual reagents.

Looking at the options, option A starts with NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, maybe that's the alkylation step.

What's the next step? Let's look at option A's steps.

Option A: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, step 2 is H2 with Pd, which is hydrogenation. So, after the alkylation, the triple bond might be hydrogenated. So, if we have cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3, hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would add H2 across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond. So, cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, because hydrogenation of a triple bond (alkyne) with H2 and Pd would typically give an alkane via full hydrogenation. So, C≡C becomes CH2-CH2.

Wait, but wait, hydrogenation of an alkyne can be done in two steps: partial hydrogenation to cis-alkene (with Lindlar catalyst) or full to alkane (with H2 and Pd). So, Pd would likely fully hydrogenate the triple bond to single bond.

So, after step 2, the alkyne becomes a single bond, so the substituent would be CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the original substituent after step 1 would be CH2-C≡C-CH3. So, after hydrogenation, that becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let me think.

The substituent is CH2-C≡C-CH3. So, when hydrogenated, it becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? That can't be right. Wait, no, triple bond C≡C becomes CH2-CH2 when fully hydrogenated. So, substituent is CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would make the substituent a butyl group? No, wait, let's see:

Wait, the initial substituent after step 1 is CH2-C≡C-CH3. So, the substituent is a propyl group (three carbons) attached to the cyclohexane. So, when hydrogenated, the triple bond becomes a single bond, so the substituent becomes CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a propyl group.

Wait, but how? Because H2 and Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So, CH2-C≡C-CH3 becomes CH2-CH2-CH3. So, the substituent would be a propyl group.

But wait, that can't be right because I'm getting a propyl group, but the target molecule has two cyclohexane rings connected via a hydroxymethyl group.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think differently.

Maybe after hydrogenation, the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a propyl group. Then, next step is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe used for elimination or for epoxide opening, but not sure.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is often used in the Birch reduction or for elimination reactions, like in the formation of alkenes via dehydrohalogenation. Alternatively, maybe it's used for epoxide ring opening, but that's less likely here.

Wait, but in the target molecule, there's a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane, which is connected to another cyclohexane. So perhaps there's a ring-forming step. Maybe a Grignard or similar reaction?

Alternatively, maybe Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxide opening, but I don't see an epoxide in the current structure. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps after the alkylation and hydrogenation, the substituent is a propyl group (CH2CH2CH3), but that doesn't immediately lead to the target structure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane or something else. Hmm.

Wait, maybe after alkylation and hydrogenation, the substituent is -CH2CH2CH3. Then, Ba(OH)2 is used in some elimination reaction, perhaps forming a double bond.

Wait, maybe the next step is Ba(OH)2, which could be a base leading to elimination. If the substituent is CH2CH2CH3, perhaps it's a bromide, and Ba(OH)2 would eliminate HBr to form a double bond. But in this case, the substituent after step 2 is just a propyl group, so I don't see how elimination would proceed without a leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used in a different way. Wait, another possibility: Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of alcohols, but that doesn't fit here.

Wait, perhaps I'm going the wrong way. Let me think again about the target molecule. The target has an aldehyde group, which suggests that somewhere in the process, an oxidation is happening.

So, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let's consider that the alkyne will be oxidized to a carbonyl group. How?

One common way to oxidize alkynes to ketones is using a strong oxidizing agent like O3 (ozone) followed by reductive workup, but that usually gives diketones. Alternatively, using Hg(OAc)2 in acidic conditions (the Heyns oxidation) can oxidize terminal alkynes to ketones. Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne (since it's -C≡CH attached to cyclohexane). So, under certain conditions, perhaps it can be oxidized to a ketone.

Wait, but another approach is to use O3 followed by H2O and Zn/H2O (reductive cleavage) to get carboxylic acids. But in any case, maybe oxidation is the way to get the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group. So, using an oxidizing agent like O3 followed by something else.

Wait, looking at the reagents in the options, option C includes O3 and (CH3)2S. So, that sounds like ozonolysis followed by reductive workup.

Wait, ozonolysis of a terminal alkyne would typically give a diketone, but maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the alkyne as being converted into a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: perhaps we can convert the alkyne into a carbonyl via hydration. For example, using HgSO4 and H2SO4 (mercuric sulfate in sulfuric acid) with water. That's the hydroboration method, but I think that's more for alkenes. Alternatively, I remember that the hydration of an alkyne can be done under specific conditions to produce a carbonyl.

Wait, hydration of alkynes can be done in two ways: via acid (H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O) to give a ketone, or via base (like Hg(OAc)2, H2O, NH3) to give a carboxylic acid. So, in this case, using H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O would likely give a ketone, not an aldehyde.

But the target has an aldehyde, so perhaps there's an aldehyde formation step.

Wait, maybe the initial steps involve forming a cyclopropane ring, which upon ring-opening would form a carbonyl group. Alternatively, perhaps a Grignard reagent is involved.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the target structure again. It has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group (CHO) and a hydroxymethyl group (CH(OH)CH2-cyclohexane?), but perhaps it's more accurately a CH(OH) group attached to a cyclohexyl group and the main ring.

Wait, perhaps the key is to form a secondary alcohol, which can then be oxidized to an aldehyde.

So, first, form a secondary alcohol, then oxidize to aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diol, then some kind of elimination or oxidation.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again and see which reagent sequences might lead to the target.

Option D: 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH.

Hmm. Let's think about each step.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Methanol is a methylating agent. So, NaNH2 is a strong base, which would deprotonate the alkyne. Then, methanol would methylate the acetylide. So, ethynylcyclohexane would become cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-OCH3? No, wait, methanol is CH3OH. Deprotonating the alkyne gives the acetylide, which would attack the methyl group from CH3OH? No, wait, that's not how it works. Acetylide is a strong base and would deprotonate CH3OH, but CH3OH isn't a good electrophile for alkylation. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide would react with methanol in a nucleophilic substitution, but methanol is not a good leaving group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps NaNH2 is used to deprotonate the alkyne, and then methanol acts as a methylating agent. So, the acetylide would attack CH3-O- (but that's not a good leaving group). Alternatively, perhaps the NaNH2 is used in a deprotonation to form the acetylide, which then is quenched with methanol, leading to the substitution. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

Step 2 in option D is Li in liquid NH3. That's a typical condition for Birch reduction or for elimination reactions, perhaps forming alkenes. Alternatively, Li in NH3 is used for deprotonation to form strong bases or for elimination.

Wait, Li in liquid ammonia is also used for the formation of Grignard reagents, but that typically requires diethyl ether. Alternatively, it's used for the reduction of carbonyl groups to alkanes, but I'm not sure.

Then, step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozone followed by a reductive workup (like with Zn in aqueous acid) typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. (CH3)2S is a mild reductant, maybe used to prevent over-oxidation. So, if a double bond is present, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

Step 4 is NH4OH, which is ammonium hydroxide, perhaps used for acid workup or to form amines, but more likely in this context, it's used to protonate or adjust the pH.

Alternatively, maybe the sequence is:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and alkylation to form a longer alkyne.

2. Reduction of the alkyne to a cis-alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form aldehydes or ketones.

But I'm not exactly sure how this would connect to the target molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to form a propargyl alcohol, then perform some oxidation.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach starts with converting the alkyne into an aldehyde. So, an alkyne to aldehyde.

One way to do that is via oxidation. For example, using a strong oxidizing agent like O3 followed by reductive workup (like with Zn and H2O) could give a diketone, but that might not directly produce an aldehyde.

Alternatively, using Hg(OAc)2 in a basic solution to hydrate the alkyne into a ketone. But that would produce a ketone, not an aldehyde.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl via a different method. Wait, another method for converting alkynes to aldehydes is via the oxymercuration reaction, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a bromide, then subjected to elimination.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the target molecule's structure and see how each step would contribute.

The target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a hydroxymethyl group connected to another cyclohexane. Also, there's an aldehyde group on the same carbon.

So, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a ring expansion, where the ethynyl group is transformed into a bridge connecting two cyclohexane rings.

Wait, another thought: the target's structure suggests that the ethynyl group is converted into a CH2 group, perhaps via hydrogenation, and then some kind of ring-forming reaction occurs, creating a bridge with a hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group (C≡CH) is hydrogenated to CH2-CH2, but that would just make an ethyl group. Alternatively, maybe after hydrogenation, the substituent is further modified.

Hmm, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and alkylation.

2. Partial hydrogenation to form a cis-alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to break the double bond into two carbonyls.

4. Workup to form the aldehyde.

But I'm not exactly sure. Let me look back at the options.

Option D's reagents:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps alkylation to form a longer alkyne.

2. Li, liq NH3 → perhaps Birch reduction or elimination to form a double bond.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → workup.

So, let's imagine the steps:

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH).

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Deprotonate the alkyne to form acetylide. Then, methylate it with methanol? Hmm, but methanol isn't a good alkylating agent. Maybe I'm misunderstanding this step. Alternatively, perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by a substitution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps step 1 is forming a propargyl alcohol or some other functional group.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a deprotonation and alkylation with methanol to form cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-OCH3. But that seems unlikely, as methanol isn't a good methylating agent in this context.

Alternatively, maybe it's a deprotonation, and then quenching with methanol to form a ketone via hydration. Wait, the hydration of an alkyne can be done with HgSO4 and H2SO4 in H2O to form a ketone. But the reagent here is NaNH2 and methanol, which doesn't fit that scenario.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck here. Maybe I should think about each option's reaction steps and see which makes the most sense.

Looking at option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. I'm not exactly sure, but perhaps this is a deprotonation followed by alkylation. Maybe the acetylide attacks a methyl group from methanol, but I don't think that's feasible. Alternatively, maybe NaNH2 is used to deprotonate, and then methanol acts as a proton source, but that doesn't change the structure.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. This is a strong base, perhaps used for elimination. If after step 1, we have an alkyne with a methyl group, then treating with Li in NH3 might induce elimination, forming a double bond.

Wait, if after step 1, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3 (from alkylation with methyl chloride in option A), then step 2 (H2/Pd) would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a straight chain substituent, but that's not helpful for forming a ring.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to perform a hydrogenation to form a cis-alkene, then another reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct reagents are such that the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group. For example, using O3 followed by reductive workup to form an aldehyde.

Wait, another idea: the target has both an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group. Maybe the aldehyde is formed via oxidation, and the hydroxymethyl via some kind of dihydroxylation followed by ring-forming.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to a cis-alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form two carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form the aldehyde and hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, maybe that's possible.

So, let's go through option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate the triple bond to CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that would make a single bond, so the substituent becomes a propyl group (CH2CH2CH3).

Wait, but that doesn't help in forming a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is partial, but I think with Pd and H2, it's full hydrogenation.

Then, step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S → ozonolysis of a double bond. Wait, but after step 2, there is no double bond. So that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think again about the target molecule. It has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl attached to another cyclohexane. So, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a new ring via some kind of cyclopropane ring opening, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group, then some kind of Claisen or aldol condensation occurs to form a ring.

Wait, another angle: the target molecule has a structure where the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl groups are on the same carbon. That suggests that perhaps the aldehyde is generated from a primary alcohol via oxidation.

So, maybe the process is:

- Convert the alkyne into a primary alcohol.

- Then, oxidize the primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

But wait, how would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group, then further functionalized.

Let me think about the reagents again. Looking for a step that would introduce an aldehyde group.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Deprotonate the alkyne to form the acetylide.

2. Alkylate with a methyl group to form a longer alkyne.

3. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane.

No, that doesn't help with the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone via oxidation, then that ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde. But I don't see how that would introduce the cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to perform a cyclopropanation. For example, using a Simmons-Smith reaction to add a cyclopropane ring, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, maybe I should think about each option's steps and see which leads to the target.

Option C:

Reagents:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate the triple bond to CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → but if there's no double bond, ozonolysis won't do much.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. If after step 2, the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a single bond. So, ozonolysis wouldn't act on that. So, this option doesn't seem right.

Option B:

Reagents:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkylation with ethyl group.

2. Li/liq. NH3 → perhaps elimination to form a double bond.

3. O3/H2O → ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH → workup.

So, step 1: ethynylcyclohexane becomes ethyl-alkyne.

Wait, after alkylation with ethyl chloride, the alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Then, step 2: Li in NH3. Maybe this induces elimination, forming a double bond. So, the triple bond becomes a double bond. But Li in NH3 is typically a strong base, causing elimination.

So, CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3 → upon treatment with Li in NH3, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a double bond, forming CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? Or maybe a double bond forms between the two central carbons.

Wait, another possibility: the alkyne is first converted into a trans-alkene via deprotonation and then elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is reduced to a cis-alkene using Li in NH3.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. But then, how does that lead to the target?

Hmm, perhaps if after ozonolysis, each cleavage produces a carbonyl group. But in the target, there's an aldehyde, so maybe one of the cleavages forms an aldehyde.

Wait, but the target has a cyclohexane ring, so perhaps the cleavage is between two cyclohexane rings, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a cyclopropane, then opened to form rings.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should consider another approach.

The target molecule has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane, which is further connected to another cyclohexane. So, perhaps the alkyne is used to form a bridge between two cyclohexane rings, with a hydroxymethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a CH2OH group, then used to form the bridge.

Wait, thinking back to the reagents, Ba(OH)2 is in option A. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, often used in elimination reactions, like in the formation of alkenes from dihalides, or in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones.

Wait, perhaps after step 2 in option A, which is H2/Pd, the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, Ba(OH)2 could cause elimination, forming a double bond, but without a leaving group, that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxide ring opening, but I don't see an epoxide in this scenario.

Another thought: maybe the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation, then that carbonyl is reduced to a CH2 group, but that doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a cyclopropane ring via some cycloaddition, then the ring opens to form the necessary structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: look for the aldehyde group. The aldehyde is likely formed by oxidizing a primary alcohol.

So, steps must include:

- Forming a primary alcohol.

- Oxidizing it to an aldehyde.

So, how to form that primary alcohol from the alkyne.

Wait, the alkyne to alcohol could be done via hydration, but that would give a ketone. To get a primary alcohol, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a gem-diol (via ozonolysis and reductive workup), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a propargyl alcohol, then that is reduced to a primary alcohol.

Wait, another possibility: hydroboration of the alkyne. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether, then hydrolyzed to form a diol, which can then be oxidized.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck because I'm not considering the correct sequence.

Wait, let me think about the target molecule again. It has a structure where the aldehyde is on a carbon that's also attached to a hydroxymethyl group connected to a cyclohexane.

So, perhaps the synthesis involves creating a bridge between two cyclohexane rings via a CH(OH)CH2 group.

Wait, another approach: the ethynyl group is converted into a CH2 group, then a Grignard reagent is used to add a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is used to create a bridge via a [2+2] cycloaddition, but that's speculative.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about each option's possible products.

Option D:

Reagents:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps nothing much happens, since methanol isn't a good methylating agent. Maybe deprotonation of the alkyne.

2. Li, liq. NH3 → perhaps elimination to form a double bond.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → cleaves the double bond into two carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → workup.

So, starting with ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH).

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. NaNH2 deprotonates the alkyne to form cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C^−. Methanol (CH3OH) would then donate a methyl group, but I don't think that's feasible here. Alternatively, maybe the NaNH2 is a base for deprotonation, and the methanol is quenching the acetylide, but I'm not sure. Maybe the product after step 1 is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-OCH3, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 1, the alkyne is still as is, but now with a negative charge, and then quenched with methanol, giving cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-OCH3. But I'm not confident.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. Maybe this induces elimination, turning the triple bond into a double bond. So, the substituent becomes CH2-C=CH2.

Wait, but that would require the structure to have a triple bond after step 1, then double bond after step 2.

But the target doesn't have a double bond, so I'm not sure.

Then, step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, the substituent would become two carbonyl groups. But in the target, we have an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group, so perhaps one carbonyl is an aldehyde and the other is a ketone.

Wait, but the target has a cyclohexane ring, so maybe the ozonolysis forms a diketone, which upon workup gives two aldehyde groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis is used to form the aldehyde group.

After ozonolysis and workup, if we have a carbonyl group, then maybe some kind of ring-forming occurs.

This is getting a bit too vague. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Let me see why.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2 and methanol → maybe deprotonate and then quench with methanol, but not sure.

2. Li in liq. NH3 → perhaps forms a Grignard-like reagent or induces elimination.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S → cleaves the double bond into carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → workup, perhaps to form aldehydes.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and alkylation.

2. Reduction to cis-alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form two carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form aldehydes.

But I'm not sure how that would lead to the target.

Wait, another thought: maybe the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation, then the carbonyl is reduced to a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde. But I don't see how that would introduce the hydroxymethyl and cyclohexyl groups.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about each option's possible products and see which matches the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me think about option C.

Option C:

Reagents:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation, so the alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making CH2-CH2-CH3. So, substituent is CH2CH2CH3.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S → but there's no double bond, so ozonolysis doesn't act.

Hmm, this doesn't seem right.

Option B:

Reagents:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkylation with ethyl group, so the substituent becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2CH2CH3.

2. Li in liq. NH3 → perhaps elimination to form a double bond, making CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3 (but that's a single bond again).

Wait, no, if the alkyne is converted to a trans-alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

After step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → ethynylcyclohexane becomes something else. Maybe the acetylide is treated with methanol, leading to CH2-C≡C-OCH3, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is not effective, and the structure remains as ethynylcyclohexane.

Then, step 2: Li in liq. NH3 → perhaps this is a Birch reduction, reducing the ring. Wait, but the target is a cyclohexane ring, so that wouldn't make sense.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about the options and see which one logically follows the steps needed.

The target molecule has an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group (like a ketone) via oxidation, then reduced to an alcohol, then oxidized to an aldehyde. But I need to see how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps the correct reagents are option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol: deprotonate alkyne, then methylate, forming CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Wait, no, methanol would not be a good methylating agent. So, perhaps step 1 is just deprotonation, and no alkylation occurs.

Then, step 2: Li in liq. NH3 → this could deprotonate the alkyne further, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is transformed into a Grignard reagent, which then reacts with something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a trans-alkene via Li in NH3, then cleaved by ozonolysis into two carbonyls.

Wait, but the target doesn't have two carbonyls. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a cyclopropane, which upon ring-opening forms the necessary structure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a propargyl alcohol, then subjected to some kind of oxidation to form a carbonyl.

But I'm not certain.

At this point, maybe I should consider that the correct answer is option C, because it includes ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which would cleave a double bond into carbonyl groups. Then, perhaps the aldehyde is formed from one of the carbonyls.

Wait, but after step 2 in option C, the substituent is a single bond (from hydrogenation), so there's no double bond for ozonolysis.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess.

Based on the target molecule, I think the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and alkylation to form a longer alkyne.

2. Partial hydrogenation to form a cis-alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to cleave the double bond into two carbonyls.

4. Workup to form aldehydes.

Looking at the options, option D has ozonolysis and workup, but I'm not sure if the other steps fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D: after deprotonation and alkylation, elimination forms a double bond, which is then cleaved by ozone to form carbonyls, leading to the aldehyde and hydroxymethyl groups.

So, after considering all possibilities, I think the correct answer is option C or D. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: the target molecule has a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the aldehyde-bearing carbon. So, perhaps the ethynyl group is used to form a bridge, and the reagents form that bridge.

Wait, perhaps the correct reagents are option C:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and methyl chloride alkylation → forms CH2-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenates to CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ozonolysis → but no double bond, so nothing happens. So option C is out.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should make a guess based on the steps that make sense.

I think the correct answer is option D. So, the steps are:

1. Deprotonate alkyne, perhaps no alkylation.

2. Li in NH3 → form a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis → cleave into carbonyls.

4. Workup → form aldehyde.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps option D is the right one.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, the analysis of the options involves determining which sequence of reagents can achieve the desired transformations. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane. This suggests the need for functional group transformations, including alkyne modifications, hydrogenation, and cleavage reactions.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which reacts with methyl chloride to alkylate the alkyne, forming a longer alkyne.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Fully hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, resulting in a propyl group.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: Likely used for elimination or base-induced reactions, but no clear pathway to introduce the hydroxymethyl or aldehyde groups.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Oxidation or hydration, but this sequence does not align with the target structure.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Alkylation of the alkyne to form a longer alkyne.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Strongly basic conditions, possibly inducing elimination or forming a double bond.
3. **O₃/ H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups, but the target molecule requires specific functional groups that this sequence does not clearly produce.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup, but the overall sequence does not lead to the desired product.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Alkylation of the alkyne to form a longer alkyne.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenation of the alkyne to a single bond, resulting in a propyl group.
3. **O₃/ (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds, but there is no double bond after full hydrogenation, making this step ineffective.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: Does not contribute to forming the aldehyde or hydroxymethyl group.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne, but methanol is not a strong alkylating agent, so no significant alkylation occurs.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Strongly basic conditions, possibly inducing elimination or forming a double bond.
3. **O₃/ (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups, which could align with forming the aldehyde group.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup to stabilize the aldehyde and hydroxymethyl groups. This sequence provides a plausible pathway to the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
Option D provides the most logical sequence of reagents to achieve the desired transformations. The steps involve alkyne deprotonation, potential elimination or double bond formation, ozonolysis to cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups, and workup to stabilize the final product. While uncertainties remain, Option D aligns best with the target structure.
