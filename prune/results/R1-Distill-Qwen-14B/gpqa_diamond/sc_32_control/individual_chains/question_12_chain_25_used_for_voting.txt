Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So the question says Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) plus a neutrino. The masses given are Pi(+) at 139.6 MeV and mu(+) at 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the products.

Wait, wait. I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total momentum must be conserved. Since Pi is initially at rest, the momenta of the decay products must be equal and opposite to each other. So the muon and the neutrino will have equal and opposite momenta, but different energies because their masses are different.

Oh right, the neutrino is massless? Or is it? Wait, in some models neutrinos have mass, but I think in this context we can assume it's massless. So the neutrino would have energy equal to its momentum, because E = pc for massless particles.

The decay equation is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Since Pi is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. Let's denote the momentum of the muon as p, and the neutrino's as p as well but in the opposite direction.

The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of Pi, which is 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino. The muon's energy is sqrt(p²c^4 + m_mu²c^4) divided by c², but since we're working in units where c=1, it's sqrt(p² + m_mu²). The neutrino's energy is just p, because E = pc for it.

So putting it together: sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, that looks like an equation we can solve for p. Let me write that down more clearly.

Let me denote m_pi = 139.6 MeV, m_mu = 105.7 MeV, and p is the magnitude of the muon's momentum.

So the equation is:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi.

Let me rearrange this. Subtract p from both sides:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = m_pi - p.

Now square both sides to eliminate the square root:

p^2 + m_mu^2 = (m_pi - p)^2 = m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi p + p^2.

Subtract p² from both sides:

m_mu^2 = m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi p.

Rearrange to solve for p:

2 m_pi p = m_pi^2 - m_mu^2.

So p = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 m_pi).

Let me plug in the numbers. m_pi is 139.6, m_mu is 105.7.

Compute m_pi squared: 139.6^2. Let me calculate that. 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

m_mu squared: 105.7^2. 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49, and cross terms 2*100*5.7=1140. So (105.7)^2 = (100 +5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 +32.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

So m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 is 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 MeV².

Now, 2 m_pi is 2 *139.6 = 279.2 MeV.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that. 279.2 into 8315.67.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Let me approximate. 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30 = 8376, minus 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8. But 29 * 279.2 is 8096.8, which is less than 8315.67.

Difference is 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

Now, how much is 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783.

So p ≈ 29.783 MeV/c.

Wait, but let me be precise. Maybe using calculator steps.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.783: Let me compute 279.2 *29 = 8096.8, 279.2 *0.783 = ?

279.2 *0.7 = 195.44, 279.2 *0.08=22.336, 279.2 *0.003=0.8376. Adding these: 195.44 +22.336 = 217.776, +0.8376= 218.6136. So 279.2 *29.783 ≈ 8096.8 +218.6136 = 8315.4136, which is very close to 8315.67. So p≈29.783 MeV/c. Close enough.

So p ≈29.78 MeV/c.

Now, the muon's kinetic energy is its total energy minus its rest energy. The total energy of the muon is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) → which is sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Wait, let me compute that. 29.78 squared is approximately (30 -0.22)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.22 +0.22^2 = 900 -13.2 +0.0484≈886.848. 105.7^2 is 11172.49.

So 886.848 +11172.49 = 12059.338. Square root of that is sqrt(12059.338). Let me see, 109^2 is 11881, 110^2=12100. 12059 is between them. 110^2 is 12100, so 12059 is 41 less. So sqrt(12059) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So the muon's energy is about 109.81 MeV, its rest energy is 105.7 MeV. So kinetic energy is 109.81 -105.7 =4.11 MeV.

Wait, but the options don't have exactly 4.11. Let's look:

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's close.

Wait, but wait. The neutrino's energy is p, which is 29.78 MeV. But looking at the options, the neutrino's KE is the same as its energy since it's massless. So the neutrino's KE is 29.78 MeV, which rounds to 29.8 MeV.

So the KE of muon is approximately 4.11 MeV, which is about 4.12 when rounded. So D option is 4.12 and 29.8.

Wait, but another approach: I think I might have made a mistake in that when p is calculated, maybe I should have been more precise.

Wait, let me recompute p exactly. 

m_pi^2 = (139.6)^2 = let's compute it accurately.

139.6 *139.6:

= (140 -0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 +0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

m_mu^2 = (105.7)^2, as before, 11172.49 MeV².

So m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 =19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 MeV².

Then p = (8315.67) / (2*139.6) = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Compute that division accurately.

8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Let me do 279.2 × 29 = 8096.8.

Subtract that from 8315.67: 8315.67-8096.8=218.87.

Now, 218.87 ÷ 279.2 ≈ 0.784.

So p≈29.784 MeV/c.

So p is approximately 29.784.

So the neutrino's energy is 29.784, so around 29.8 MeV.

The muon's energy: sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

29.784^2 = (29.78)^2 ≈ 886.848.

105.7^2 = 11172.49.

Total under square root: 886.848 +11172.49=12059.338.

sqrt(12059.338) ≈ 109.813 MeV.

Rest energy of muon is 105.7, so KE = 109.813 -105.7 =4.113 MeV ≈4.11 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So D is the closest.

Wait, but let me check the other way. Could I have messed up the calculation of the kinetic energy?

Another approach: Maybe the total energy is the sum of the muon's KE plus its rest energy plus the neutrino's energy. Wait, but no, the neutrino's energy is entirely kinetic since it's massless.

Wait, maybe I should use the invariant quantity, the Mandelstam variable s. But that's probably overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps using conservation of energy and momentum directly.

Let me think again.

The initial energy is just m_pi c², which is 139.6 MeV. The initial momentum is zero.

After decay, the muon has energy E_mu = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) /c², but in units where c=1, E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2).

The neutrino's energy E_nu is p, since for massless particles, E = pc.

So the sum E_mu + E_nu = m_pi.

So sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi.

Which is the same equation as before, so the same p and E.

So the calculation is correct.

Therefore, the muon's KE is about 4.11 MeV, which is approximately 4.12, and the neutrino's KE is 29.78, which is 29.8.

Looking back at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

So the answer should be D.

To determine the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

where the \(\pi^+\) is stationary, we use the conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). The neutrino is assumed to be massless (\(m_\nu = 0\)).

### Step 1: Conservation of Energy
The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the \(\pi^+\), which is \(E_{\pi} = m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\). After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the \(\mu^+\) and the neutrino:

\[
E_\mu + E_\nu = m_{\pi^+}.
\]

The energy of the \(\mu^+\) is given by \(E_\mu = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}\), where \(p\) is the magnitude of the momentum of the \(\mu^+\). The energy of the neutrino is \(E_\nu = p\), since it is massless.

Substituting these into the energy conservation equation:

\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p = m_{\pi^+}.
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \(p\)
Rearranging the equation:

\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = m_{\pi^+} - p.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 = (m_{\pi^+} - p)^2 = m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2 m_{\pi^+} p + p^2.
\]

Canceling \(p^2\) from both sides:

\[
m_{\mu^+}^2 = m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2 m_{\pi^+} p.
\]

Rearranging for \(p\):

\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2}{2 m_{\pi^+}}.
\]

Substituting the values \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\):

\[
m_{\pi^+}^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \, \text{MeV}^2, \quad m_{\mu^+}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2,
\]

\[
m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 \, \text{MeV}^2,
\]

\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{2 \cdot 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c.
\]

### Step 3: Energy of the \(\mu^+\)
The total energy of the \(\mu^+\) is:

\[
E_\mu = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
\]

Substituting \(p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\):

\[
E_\mu = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]

\[
(29.78)^2 = 886.848, \quad (105.7)^2 = 11172.49,
\]

\[
E_\mu = \sqrt{886.848 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.338} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The kinetic energy of the \(\mu^+\) is:

\[
KE_\mu = E_\mu - m_{\mu^+} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Step 4: Energy of the Neutrino
The neutrino's energy is equal to its momentum:

\[
E_\nu = p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with Options
The kinetic energy of the \(\mu^+\) is approximately \(4.11 \, \text{MeV}\), which rounds to \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\), and the neutrino's energy is approximately \(29.78 \, \text{MeV}\), which rounds to \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\). These values match **Option D**.
