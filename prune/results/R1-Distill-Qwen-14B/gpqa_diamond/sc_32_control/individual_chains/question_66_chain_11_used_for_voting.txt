Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this SMEFT question. I remember SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's about how we extend the Standard Model using higher-dimensional operators. But I'm a bit rusty on the symmetries involved here.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let me think about each one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think that's a big one. The Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory, right? So any effective theory should respect that too. Operators in SMEFT should transform covariantly under Lorentz transformations. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, right? So it's a bigger symmetry group. But in SMEFT, the operators are classified in terms of their Lorentz indices and other quantum numbers. I'm not sure if all SMEFT operators automatically respect Poincare. Because Poincare includes momentum conservation, and in an effective theory, you might have terms that look like higher dimensions but maybe not respect translation invariance? Hmm, but SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so I think it's still supposed to have Poincare symmetry. Or maybe not. Wait, maybe the presence of higher dimension terms doesn't break Poincare because they are still local. So perhaps Poincare is respected as well. But I'm a bit confused here. Does SMEFT require Poincare symmetry? I think that yes, because the operators are written in a way that respects local symmetries, including Poincare.

Wait, but wait. Poincare includes translations. So do the operators in SMEFT respect translation symmetry? Well, all the operators are local, so yes. So maybe both Lorentz and Poincare are required. But I'm not entirely sure. I'll have to think more about this.

Then, CP symmetry (3). I remember that the SM respects CP, except for certain parts like in the CKM matrix which leads to CP violation. But in SMEFT, operators can violate CP unless they're constrained by some symmetry. Wait, but do the SMEFT operators have to respect CP? Or is it possible for them to have operators that break CP? I think the SMEFT itself doesn't enforce CP symmetry. It's a framework that allows for any possible operators, provided they have the correct Lorentz structure. So operators could violate CP. But the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if some operators violate CP, then CP symmetry (3) isn't a must, so it's not a required symmetry for all operators. So option 3 isn't a required symmetry.

Finally, CPT symmetry (4). CPT is a big one in quantum field theory. I think CPT symmetry is required in any Lorentz-invariant theory. Because Lorentz symmetry implies CPT symmetry. So any operator that respects Lorentz symmetry must also respect CPT. So in SMEFT, since all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, they must also respect CPT. So option 4 is a must.

So to recap, which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect? Lorentz (1) and CPT (4) must be respected. What about Poincare (2)? Poincare includes Lorentz plus translations. Since SMEFT is an effective theory, it's built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, which necessarily includes Poincare because it's a subset. Or wait, does being Lorentz-invariant imply Poincare-invariant? Because Poincare includes translations, which are part of the symmetry in a local field theory. So maybe all SMEFT operators respect Poincare as well.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. So the question is whether Poincare (2) is a required symmetry. If Poincare is a subset of the symmetries, but Lorentz is included in Poincare. Or wait, no, Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So if a theory has Poincare symmetry, it must have both. But if a theory only has Lorentz symmetry, but not translation, then it doesn't have Poincare. So for SMEFT, the operators are written in a way that they are local, meaning they respect translation invariance. Because in an effective theory, you can't have non-local terms. So operators are local and hence translation invariant, so Poincare is respected.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think. The SMEFT operators are written as local operators. So, for example, any operator would be a product of fields at the same spacetime point, making it Lorentz and Poincare invariant. So, yes, Poincare symmetry is also respected. So which options include 1, 2, and 4?

Looking at the options:

Option A is 1,2. No, because 4 (CPT) is also required.

Option B is 3,4. No, because 1 (Lorentz) is required.

Option C is 1,2,4. So Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. Since I think all of these are required, but wait, is Poincare actually required?

Wait, Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translations. Since SMEFT is built in a way that respects both, so yes, Poincare must be respected.

So if that's the case, which option includes 1,2,4? Option C is 1,2,4.

But earlier I thought that Lorentz implies CPT. So C must also be required. So all three: 1,2,4.

Wait, but CPT is a separate thing. So if all operators must respect Lorentz, which implies CPT, then 4 must also be respected. So the operators must respect 1,2,4. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but what about the other option, D: 1,3,4. No because 3 is CP, which isn't a required symmetry. So I think the correct options are 1, 2, and 4, which is option C.

Wait, but another point. Does SMEFT have to respect Poincare symmetry? Because SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, but Poincare includes translations. Because SMEFT is a theory that includes all the symmetries of the SM. The SM is Poincare-invariant. So yes, the SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So 2 is correct.

So the correct answer would be option C: 1,2,4.

But wait, I'm a bit unsure because I've read that the SMEFT operators are required to respect the same symmetries as the SM. The SM respects Poincare, Lorentz, and CPT. So SMEFT operators must also respect these.

So yes, all three must be respected. So the correct answer is option C.

To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is an effective field theory based on the Standard Model, which respects Lorentz symmetry. All operators in SMEFT must transform covariantly under Lorentz transformations, so Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental requirement.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since SMEFT is a local effective field theory, its operators are constructed to respect translation invariance, which implies that Poincaré symmetry is also required.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry is not necessarily respected by all operators in SMEFT. The framework allows for operators that can violate CP symmetry unless explicitly constrained by additional assumptions. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a universal requirement for all SMEFT operators.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory and is implied by Lorentz symmetry. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). 

**Option C** (1, 2, 4) is the correct choice.
