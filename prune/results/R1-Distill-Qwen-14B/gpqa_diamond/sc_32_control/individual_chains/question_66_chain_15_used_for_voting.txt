Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory). I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are 1. Lorentz Symmetry, 2. Poincare symmetry, 3. CP symmetry, 4. CPT symmetry. The choices are A) 1,2; B)3,4; C)1,2,4; D)1,3,4.

Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective field theory that incorporates all possible interactions that can be constructed from the Standard Model fields while respecting certain symmetries. Effective theories often preserve the same symmetries as the underlying theory, which in this case is the Standard Model.

Wait, let me get the symmetries straight. Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But wait, SMEFT operators are built from the SM fields, which do respect Lorentz symmetry. So all SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz. But what about Poincare? Because Poincare includes the translations, which are part of the spacetime symmetries. But SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so when you expand around a certain energy scale, you can have operators of different dimensions. Do they all have to respect Poincare? I think yes because the SM respects Poincare, so the effective theory should too.

Wait, but do operators in SMEFT necessarily have to respect Poincare symmetry? I think all the terms in SMEFT are constructed in a way that they are consistent with the Poincare symmetry. Because if they didn't, the theory wouldn't make sense as an effective field theory since it breaks microcausality or something. So both Lorentz and Poincare must be respected, which means options C and A are possible. But since the question includes both 1 and 2, which are Lorentz and Poincare, that would point to option A or C.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no. Poincare is a bigger symmetry. The question is whether operators in SMEFT must respect each symmetry. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question is about what must be respected by all operators. So if the operator is part of the SMEFT, which is built from the SM, which respects Poincare, then all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare, so Lorentz is automatically included. Wait, but the options don't have all four. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: what symmetries are automatically respected by any effective field theory? Lorentz symmetry is a spacetime symmetry and must be respected by all terms in the Lagrangian. Same with Poincare, which includes Lorentz and translations. But wait, in SMEFT, you have higher-dimensional operators, like dimension 6, 8, etc. Do those operators break Poincare symmetry? No, because they are built from the SM fields, which are Poincare invariant. So all SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which implies Lorentz.

Now, what about CP and CPT symmetry? The SM itself isn't CP symmetric. For instance, CP violation is observed in the weak interaction. So, the SM doesn't respect CP symmetry. Therefore, SMEFT doesn't necessarily have to respect CP either. Because you can have operators that violate CP. So operators in SMEFT might not respect CP symmetry. Similarly, CPT symmetry is a bigger symmetry and includes time reversal. But wait, the SM is CPT symmetric. However, in effective theories, do we require CPT symmetry? Or could operators violate CPT? I think in general, CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. Wait, but in the SMEFT, because it's a low-energy effective theory, can it have operators that violate CPT? Hmm.

Wait, I remember that the SMEFT must respect all the symmetries of the Standard Model. Because it's an effective theory derived from the SM. So the SM respects Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, but not necessarily CP. So the SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, but not necessarily CP.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let's clarify. The Standard Model is CPT symmetric. Because all the terms in the SM respect CPT. So any effective theory derived from the SM must also respect CPT symmetry. But the SM does not respect CP symmetry, as we have CP violation. So SMEFT operators can include terms that violate CP. Therefore, operators in SMEFT must respect CPT, but not necessarily CP.

So, to recap:

- Lorentz symmetry (1): Must be respected.
- Poincare symmetry (2): Must be respected since it's a subset of the SM's symmetries and the SMEFT is built from SM fields.
- CP symmetry (3): Not necessarily respected; SMEFT can include CP-violating operators.
- CPT symmetry (4): Must be respected, since the SM respects CPT, so the effective theory must also respect it.

So the symmetries that must be respected are 1, 2, and 4. But wait, wait. Because Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translational invariance. So if you respect Poincare, you automatically respect Lorentz. So the question is, are 1 and 2 both required, or just 2?

Wait, the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. So if an operator respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz. So if all operators respect Poincare, then 2 is a must, and automatically Lorentz is too. But the option C is 1,2,4 and option A is 1,2. So if the answer is that all operators must respect 1,2,4, then the correct option would be C.

Wait, but wait. The Poincare symmetry includes translations. SMEFT operators are built in a way that they have a certain scaling with energy, but all operators must be Poincare invariant. So any term in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be Poincare invariant. So yes, both Lorentz and Poincare must be respected.

So the correct answer would include 1,2, and 4, which is option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because the question includes four options, and the correct ones are 1, 2, and 4. So the choice would be option C.

But wait, looking back: the options are:

A) 1,2
B)3,4
C)1,2,4
D)1,3,4

So the correct must include 1, 2, and 4. So the answer is C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed from the Standard Model (SM) fields and must respect the same symmetries as the SM. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is a fundamental spacetime symmetry. Since the SM respects Lorentz symmetry, all SMEFT operators, being derived from the SM, must also respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. Since the SM respects Poincaré symmetry, all SMEFT operators must also respect Poincaré symmetry. This implies that Lorentz symmetry is automatically included if Poincaré symmetry is respected.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not respect CP symmetry due to CP violation in the weak interaction. Consequently, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry, as CP-violating terms can appear in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM respects CPT symmetry, and since SMEFT is derived from the SM, all SMEFT operators must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are **Lorentz symmetry (1)**, **Poincaré symmetry (2)**, and **CPT symmetry (4)**. Therefore, the correct option is:

**Answer: C**
