Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about uncertainty in the P_z operator. Let me try to think through this step by step. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the expectation values of the operator and its square. The formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²), right?

The system is given to be in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is provided as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Oh wait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the current state is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis.

Wait, if the state is already an eigenstate of P_x, but the basis is P_z's eigenstates, then the components of the state vector are the coefficients in the P_z basis. So to find the uncertainty in P_z, I probably need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ in this state.

So let me write down the state vector. It's [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Since the basis is P_z's eigenvectors, each basis state corresponds to a particular eigenvalue of P_z. Let me look at the matrix for P_z. Its diagonal entries are ħ, 0, and -ħ. Because the matrix is diagonal, each basis vector is an eigenstate with eigenvalues as the diagonal elements.

So the state is a linear combination of these eigenstates. Let me note the coefficients:

The first component is -1/2, so the coefficient of the |+ħ> state is -1/2.

The second component is 1/√2, which is the coefficient of the |0> state, because the middle eigenvalue is 0.

The third component is -1/2, coefficient of |-ħ> state.

Wait, but wait—actually, the eigenvalues for P_z are on the diagonal. The P_z matrix is diagonal, so the basis vectors are |1> = [1,0,0], |2> = [0,1,0], |3> = [0,0,1], and their eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ respectively.

So the given state is a vector in this basis. So the state is:

ψ = (-1/2)|1> + (1/√2)|2> + (-1/2)|3>

Now, since P_z is diagonal in this basis, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues.

Wait, but the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is calculated as ψ† P_z ψ.

But since P_z is diagonal and ψ is given in this basis, it's easier. The expectation value is the sum of each component squared times the corresponding eigenvalue.

So for each component a_i in ψ, ⟨P_z⟩ = sum (a_i^* a_i * λ_i), where λ_i are the eigenvalues.

Wait, but wait, the coefficients are already in the P_z eigenbasis. So each a_i is the amplitude for state |i>, whose P_z is λ_i.

So here, the coefficients are:

a₁ = -1/2, a₂ = 1/√2, a₃ = -1/2.

Eigenvalues λ₁ = ħ, λ₂ = 0, λ₃ = -ħ.

So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ would be |a1|² λ₁ + |a2|² λ₂ + |a3|² λ3.

Calculating each term:

|a1|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So term1 = (1/4) * ħ.

|a2|² = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. λ2 is 0, so term2 is 0.

|a3|² = (1/2)^2 =1/4. λ3 is -ħ. So term3 = (1/4)(-ħ) = - ħ/4.

Adding these up: (1/4)ħ + 0 + (-1/4)ħ = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Wait, that's interesting. So the expectation value of P_z in this state is zero. Hmm.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the square of the eigenvalues on the diagonal. So ⟨P_z²⟩ is sum |a_i|² (λ_i)^2.

So λ1^2 is ħ², λ2^2 is 0, λ3^2 is ħ².

So term1: (1/4)* ħ².

term2: (1/2)*0 =0.

term3: (1/4)* ħ².

So sum is (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨ P_z² ⟩ = (1/2) ħ².

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² ). But since ⟨P_z⟩ is 0, this simplifies to sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ ) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ)/√2.

Wait, that sounds right. So the uncertainty is ħ over square root of 2. Looking at the options, option B is ħ/√2.

So the answer should be option B.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\hbar$, and the state vector is given as:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, and the eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the diagonal entries of the $P_z$ matrix. Since the state $\psi$ is expressed in the $P_z$ eigenbasis, the coefficients of $\psi$ represent the probabilities of the system being in the corresponding eigenstates.

### Step 1: Calculate $\langle P_z \rangle$
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_i |a_i|^2 \lambda_i,
\]

where $a_i$ are the coefficients of $\psi$ and $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of $P_z$. The coefficients are:

\[
a_1 = -1/2, \quad a_2 = 1/\sqrt{2}, \quad a_3 = -1/2,
\]

and the eigenvalues are:

\[
\lambda_1 = \hbar, \quad \lambda_2 = 0, \quad \lambda_3 = -\hbar.
\]

The probabilities $|a_i|^2$ are:

\[
|a_1|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4, \quad |a_2|^2 = (1/\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2, \quad |a_3|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a_1|^2 \lambda_1 + |a_2|^2 \lambda_2 + |a_3|^2 \lambda_3 = \frac{1}{4} \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_i |a_i|^2 \lambda_i^2.
\]

The eigenvalues squared are:

\[
\lambda_1^2 = \hbar^2, \quad \lambda_2^2 = 0, \quad \lambda_3^2 = \hbar^2.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a_1|^2 \lambda_1^2 + |a_2|^2 \lambda_2^2 + |a_3|^2 \lambda_3^2 = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
