Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy it uses to accelerate a certain nucleus. Hmm... The question is asking for the energy when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Oh wait, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. So first, I need to figure out what that nucleus is. Let me think, Li is lithium. The standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A=6.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, you need to use relativistic equations. So the speed is 0.96c. I think the formula for kinetic energy in relativity is different from the classical one. Let me recall. Oh right, the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. And the kinetic energy is total minus rest mass. So the formula is K = (gamma - 1) * m0c².

Wait, wait, but in this problem, are they asking for the total energy or the kinetic energy? The question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." Since RHIC accelerates ions to a certain energy, I think they're referring to the kinetic energy. Or maybe it's the total energy? Hmm. Wait, sometimes in particle physics, when they say the energy of the collider, they refer to the kinetic energy each beam has. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. RHIC collides heavy ions, so each ion has a certain energy. So maybe the problem is asking for the total energy (gamma mc²), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the options are in GeV, so if the rest mass energy is small compared to the kinetic energy, perhaps they're giving the kinetic energy.

Wait, but let me proceed step by step. First, find the rest mass of Li-6. The mass of a nucleus can be found using the atomic mass. Wait, wait. For that, I need the molar mass of Li-6. Lithium's atomic number is 3. So Li-6 has a molar mass of 6 g/mol approximately. But I need the actual rest mass in kg. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus.

Alternatively, I remember that the rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which is 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass would be 3*(938) + 3*(939) = let's compute that. 3*938 is 2814, 3*939 is 2817. So total is 5631 MeV, which is 5.631 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second. Is that correct? Because when you have multiple nucleons, you have to consider binding energy. Oh, right, because the actual mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons due to binding energy (mass defect). But for the purpose of this problem, is that considered? Hmm. The problem says 'energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c'. Wait, if we're using the rest mass energy, should we use the exact mass of Li-6? Because the binding energy would affect the rest mass. But I'm not given any specific data about the mass of Li-6. So maybe I should proceed with the assumption that they're using the sum of the individual protons and neutrons. Because without specific data, it's hard to account for the binding energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the rest mass of a Li-6 nucleus. Wait, since I don't have that data, maybe the problem expects me to use the sum of the proton and neutron masses. Let me proceed with that.

So for Li-6, number of nucleons A is 6. Each nucleon (proton and neutron) has a rest mass of approximately 938 MeV/c². So the total rest mass energy is about 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. But wait, that's without considering the binding energy. So the actual rest mass would be a bit less, but perhaps for this problem, it's acceptable to proceed with this value as the rest energy.

Next, the speed is 0.96c. So I need to calculate gamma, the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute that. v is 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait. Let me compute 0.96^2 again. 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.9216, correct. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the total energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So E_total = gamma * m0c². So E_total = 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV. Let me compute that.

3.5714 * 5 = 17.857, and 3.5714 * 0.628 is approximately 3.5714 * 0.6 is 2.1428, and 3.5714 * 0.028 is about 0.100. So 2.1428 + 0.100 = 2.2428. So total is 17.857 + 2.2428 ≈ 20.1 GeV. Wait, but that's an approximate calculation. Let me do it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 * 5.628.

Let me compute 3.5714 * 5.628:

First, 3 *5.628 =16.884.

Next, 0.5714 *5.628. Let's compute 0.5 *5.628=2.814, 0.0714*5.628≈0.404.

So 2.814 +0.404=3.218.

So 16.884 + 3.218 =20.102 GeV.

So the total energy is approximately 20.102 GeV.

But wait, the options given are A) 18.475 GeV, B)23.069 GeV, C)20.132 GeV, D)21.419 GeV.

Hmm, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close to what I just calculated.

But wait, is the question asking for kinetic energy or total energy? Because if it's kinetic energy, the formula is (gamma -1) * m0c².

Wait, the problem says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So, in particle accelerators, the energy given usually refers to the kinetic energy. So perhaps I should compute the kinetic energy instead.

So, let me compute the kinetic energy. K = (gamma -1) * m0c².

Gamma is approximately 3.5714.

So gamma -1 =2.5714.

So K = 2.5714 * 5.628 GeV.

Let me compute that. 2 *5.628=11.256. 0.5714 *5.628.

0.5 *5.628=2.814. 0.0714 *5.628≈0.404.

So 2.814 +0.404=3.218.

So total K is 11.256 +3.218=14.474 GeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are around 14 GeV. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering whether the energy is kinetic or total. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the rest energy plus kinetic energy, which would be the total energy. Because in that case, my initial calculation of about 20.1 GeV would match option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the total energy. Because RHIC accelerators usually talk about the beam energy, which is the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. Hmm.

Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The total energy E is gamma * m0c², and the kinetic energy K is (gamma -1) * m0c². So if the problem is referring to the kinetic energy, then the energy would be around 14.47 GeV, but that's not an option. If it's the total energy, about 20.1 GeV, which is option C.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which seems to align with the total energy calculation. So perhaps the question is indeed asking for the total energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me double-check the rest mass calculation.

Wait, earlier I assumed the rest mass of each nucleon as 938 MeV. But actually, the mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and the neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass would be (3 *938.272) + (3 *939.565).

Let me compute that:

3 *938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.

3 *939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.

Total is 2814.816 +2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.633511 GeV.

So more accurately, m0c² is approximately 5.6335 GeV.

So gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 -0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

So total energy E = gamma * m0c² = 3.57142857 *5.6335 GeV.

Let me compute that precisely.

3.57142857 *5.6335:

Break it down:

3 *5.6335 =16.9005.

0.57142857 *5.6335 ≈ Let's compute 0.5 *5.6335 =2.81675.

0.07142857 (approx 1/14) *5.6335 ≈ 0.4024.

So 2.81675 +0.4024 ≈3.21915.

So total E ≈16.9005 +3.21915 =20.11965 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1197 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps I can consider that as the correct answer.

Wait, but considering more precise calculations, perhaps I should use exact values. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v =0.96c. (v/c)=0.96.

(v/c)^2 =0.9216.

1 - (v/c)^2 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, because 0.28^2=0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714.

So, gamma is exactly 3.5714285714. So with m0c²=5.6335 GeV, then E=3.5714285714 *5.6335.

Let me compute this more accurately.

3.5714285714 *5.6335.

Compute 3.5714285714 *5 =17.857142857.

3.5714285714 *0.6335.

Compute 3.5714285714 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.5714285714 *0.0335 = let's see.

0.03 *3.5714285714 =0.107142857.

0.0035 *3.5714285714 ≈0.012500000.

So 0.107142857 +0.0125=0.119642857.

So 2.142857142 +0.119642857 =2.2625.

Adding to the 17.857142857 gives 17.857142857 +2.2625=20.11964286 GeV.

So E ≈20.1196 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. That's very close to 20.1196.

Wait, but perhaps the precise calculation would have a more accurate gamma. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the m0c² calculation. Let me check that again.

Wait, the mass of a proton is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², neutron is 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

3 *938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.

3 *939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.

Total: 2814.816 +2818.695 =5633.511 MeV, which is 5.633511 GeV.

So that's correct. So E=3.5714285714 *5.633511 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately using exact multiplication.

3.5714285714285714 *5.633511.

Let me write it as (3 + 0.5714285714) *5.633511.

So 3 *5.633511 =16.900533.

0.5714285714 *5.633511.

Hmm, 0.5714285714 is approximately 4/7.

But let me compute 5.633511 *0.5714285714.

Let me compute 5.633511 * (4/7) = (5.633511 *4)/7 = (22.534044)/7 ≈3.21914914.

So 16.900533 +3.21914914 =20.119682 GeV.

So E≈20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. That's close but a bit higher. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the rest mass calculation. Maybe the actual mass of Li-6 is a bit less due to binding energy. Because when you form a nucleus, the binding energy causes a mass deficit. So the rest mass would be less than the sum of individual protons and neutrons.

So the binding energy for Li-6 (Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons). The binding energy can be found using the mass defect. Let's compute it.

The mass defect is (sum of individual protons and neutrons) - (mass of nucleus).

The mass of a Li-6 nucleus can be found from the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0141 g/mol. Wait, but I'm not sure of the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the mass of a Li-6 nucleus in MeV/c².

Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the mass of Li-6. I think the actual mass of a Li-6 nucleus is about 5.639 MeV/c² per nucleon? Wait, no. Let me think correctly.

Wait, the mass of a single nucleon is about 938 MeV. So 6 nucleons would be 5628 MeV. But the actual mass of the Li-6 nucleus is less because of binding energy. So the binding energy (which is the mass defect multiplied by c²) is the energy equivalent of the mass lost.

Wait, the binding energy for Li-6 is about 5.6335 GeV (sum of protons and neutrons) minus the actual rest mass of Li-6. But I don't have the exact value for Li-6's rest mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the binding energy and just use the sum of the individual nucleon masses. In that case, the calculation I did earlier holds, and the total energy is approximately 20.1197 GeV, which would match option C (20.132 GeV) if there is a slight miscalculation in the precise gamma or mass.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute gamma again.

v = 0.96c.

v²/c² =0.96^2 = 0.9216.

1 - v²/c² = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28 exactly.

So gamma = 1/0.28 = 3.571428571428571...

So that's accurate.

Now, m0c² is 5.633511 GeV.

So E=3.5714285714 *5.633511 = ?

Let me compute 3.5714285714 *5.633511.

Compute 3 *5.633511 =16.900533.

Now, 0.5714285714 *5.633511.

Compute 0.5 *5.633511 =2.8167555.

0.0714285714 *5.633511.

0.07 *5.633511 =0.39434577.

0.0014285714 *5.633511 ≈0.008074.

So adding 0.39434577 +0.008074 =0.40242.

So 0.5714285714 part is 2.8167555 +0.40242 =3.2191755.

So total E =16.900533 +3.2191755 =20.1197085 GeV.

Which is about 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at option C: 20.132 GeV. The discrepancy is about 0.0123 GeV, which is 12.3 MeV. That's about 0.06% difference. Maybe I should consider more precise values for the masses.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact values for the proton and neutron masses.

Proton mass: m_p = 938.272 MeV/c².

Neutron mass: m_n = 939.565 MeV/c².

So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Total rest mass energy: 3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) = ?

3 *938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.

3 *939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.

Sum:2814.816 +2818.695 =5633.511 MeV =5.633511 GeV.

So that's correct.

So perhaps the exact E is 20.1197 GeV, but the option is 20.132 GeV. Hmm. That's a difference of about 0.0123 GeV. Maybe I should check if I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely. Let me compute 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) more accurately.

0.96^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

So, sqrt(0.0784) =0.28 exactly. So gamma is exactly 3.5714285714.

Hmm. So perhaps the error is elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, like considering the rest energy as just the mass of the ion including electrons.

Wait, no. The nucleus is considered here; electrons are not part of the nucleus. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be the kinetic energy, but when I calculated K earlier, it was around 14.47 GeV, which isn't an option. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the total energy, which is about 20.1197 GeV, which is very close to option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 0.0123 GeV higher than my calculation. Perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.5714285714 *5.633511 more accurately.

Let me compute this multiplication step by step.

3.5714285714 *5.633511.

Let me write it as:

5.633511 *3.5714285714.

Break it down:

5.633511 *3 =16.900533.

5.633511 *0.5 =2.8167555.

5.633511 *0.07 =0.39434577.

5.633511 *0.0014285714.

Wait, 0.0014285714 is 1/700. So 5.633511 * (1/700) ≈ 0.008047873.

Wait, but let's compute 0.0714285714.

Wait, 3.5714285714 =3 +0.5 +0.0714285714.

Wait, no. 3.5714285714 is 3 +0.5 +0.0714285714.

So 0.5 is 0.5, and 0.0714285714 is 1/14.

So, 5.633511 *0.5 =2.8167555.

5.633511 * (1/14) =5.633511 /14 ≈0.40239364.

So adding these:

16.900533 (from 3) +2.8167555 (0.5) =19.7172885.

Plus 0.40239364 (from 1/14) gives 20.119682 GeV.

Which confirms the earlier calculation. So 20.119682 GeV, which is approximately 20.1197 GeV.

But option C is 20.132 GeV. So there's about a 0.0123 GeV difference. Perhaps the issue is that I'm using the sum of the individual nucleon masses, but the actual nucleus has a lower rest mass due to binding energy. If I had a more accurate rest mass, maybe the calculation would align better.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the nucleus is moving at speed v, and the energy is calculated with the rest mass of the entire nucleus, including binding energy. Let me check what the actual mass of Li-6 is.

The exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus (which is 6Li) is approximately 6.0141 atomic mass units (u). 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.0141 u *931.5 MeV/u =6.0141 *931.5 ≈5625.5 MeV, which is 5.6255 GeV.

Wait, wait. Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0141 u. So the rest mass is 6.0141 *931.5 MeV/c². Let me compute that.

6.0141 *931.5 = Let's compute 6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.0141 *931.5 ≈13.13 MeV.

So total is 5589 +13.13 =5602.13 MeV =5.60213 GeV.

So the rest mass energy is approximately 5.60213 GeV, not 5.6335 GeV. Because the sum of the individual nucleon masses (without considering binding energy) was 5.6335 GeV, but when you take into account that the actual nucleus has a lower mass (due to binding energy), the rest mass is about 5.60213 GeV.

Ah, so that's a crucial point. So I should use the actual rest mass of Li-6, which is about 5.60213 GeV, not the sum of the individual nucleon masses.

So, let me redo the calculation with m0c² =5.60213 GeV.

So E = gamma * m0c² =3.5714285714 *5.60213 GeV.

Let me compute this.

3 *5.60213 =16.80639.

0.5714285714 *5.60213.

Compute 0.5 *5.60213=2.801065.

0.0714285714 *5.60213 ≈0.4018.

So 2.801065 +0.4018 =3.202865.

So total E =16.80639 +3.202865 =20.009255 GeV.

Wait, 20.009255 GeV is approximately 20.0093 GeV.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

3.5714285714 *5.60213.

Let me compute 3 *5.60213 =16.80639.

0.5714285714 *5.60213.

Let me compute 0.5714285714 *5.60213.

0.5 *5.60213 =2.801065.

0.0714285714 *5.60213 = let me compute 5.60213 * (1/14) =5.60213 /14 ≈0.40015214.

So 2.801065 +0.40015214 =3.20121714.

So total E =16.80639 +3.20121714 =20.00760714 GeV.

Approximately 20.0076 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.008 GeV, which is close to option C's 20.132 GeV, but not quite.

Wait, but perhaps I should use more precise values for the mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, according to standard data, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.014142 u.

So m0c² =6.014142 u * 931.494 MeV/u =6.014142 *931.494 ≈ ?

Compute 6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.014142 *931.494.

0.01 *931.494 =9.31494.

0.004142 *931.494 ≈3.853 MeV.

So total is 5588.964 +9.31494 +3.853 ≈5602.132 MeV.

Which is 5.602132 GeV.

So m0c²=5.602132 GeV.

So gamma is 3.5714285714.

E =3.5714285714 *5.602132 = ?

Let me compute this precisely.

3.5714285714 *5.602132.

Break it down:

3 *5.602132 =16.806396.

0.5714285714 *5.602132.

Compute:

0.5 *5.602132 =2.801066.

0.0714285714 *5.602132.

Compute 0.07 *5.602132=0.39214924.

0.0014285714 *5.602132≈0.008007.

So sum is 0.39214924 +0.008007 =0.40015624.

So 0.5 part is 2.801066 +0.40015624 =3.20122224.

So total E =16.806396 +3.20122224 =20.00761824 GeV.

So approximately 20.0076 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) 20.132 GeV, but it's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think again. Is the nucleus moving at 0.96c, and I'm to find the energy required, which could be the kinetic energy or the total energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy. So K = (gamma -1)* m0c².

With gamma=3.5714285714, gamma-1=2.5714285714.

So K=2.5714285714 *5.602132 GeV.

Compute 2 *5.602132 =11.204264.

0.5714285714 *5.602132 = let's compute.

0.5 *5.602132 =2.801066.

0.0714285714 *5.602132=0.400156.

So 2.801066 +0.400156=3.201222.

So K=11.204264 +3.201222=14.405486 GeV.

Which is about 14.4055 GeV. But the options don't have this. So that can't be the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the total energy, which is 20.0076 GeV, but none of the options match that exactly. The closest option is C) 20.132 GeV, but that's higher than our calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the approach. Let me think again: perhaps the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, but when I computed that, it's about 14.4 GeV, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm using the wrong mass. Maybe I should use the mass of the entire ion, including electrons. But the nucleus is Li-6, which is a charged nucleus. In the ion form, it would have electrons too. Wait, but the question specifies X is the nucleus. So I think electrons are not included. So the mass of the nucleus is correct.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 5.602132 GeV, and gamma is 3.57142857, so E=20.0076 GeV, which is approximately 20.0076 GeV. But none of the options are that close. The closest option is C) 20.132 GeV, which is 0.124 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma. Let me compute gamma again. Wait, perhaps I should compute 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) more accurately.

Wait, 0.96 is 48/50. But that's not helpful. Let me compute 1 - (0.96)^2 again.

0.96^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly, since 0.28^2 =0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 =3.5714285714.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem uses a different approach. Maybe it's using the relativistic energy-momentum relation but considering the particles as non-relativistic? No, because the speed is 0.96c, which is highly relativistic.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass considering binding energy as I did earlier, but with a more precise calculation.

Wait, the exact value of the mass of Li-6 is 6.014142 u. So, m0c² =6.014142 *931.494 MeV/u.

Let me compute that.

6.014142 *931.494 = ?

Compute 6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.014142 *931.494 ≈0.014142 *930 ≈13.13 MeV.

So total is approximately 5588.964 +13.13 =5602.094 MeV, which is 5.602094 GeV.

So m0c² =5.602094 GeV.

So E = gamma * m0c² =3.57142857 *5.602094.

Compute:

3.57142857 *5.602094.

Let me compute this using a calculator approach.

5.602094 *3 =16.806282.

5.602094 *0.5 =2.801047.

5.602094 *0.07142857.

Wait, 0.07142857 is 1/14, so 5.602094 /14 ≈0.40014957.

So adding these together:

16.806282 (from 3) +2.801047 (from 0.5) =19.607329.

Plus 0.40014957 (from 1/14) gives 20.00747857 GeV.

So E≈20.00747857 GeV.

Still, that's about 20.0075 GeV.

But none of the options match this. Hmm.

Looking back at the options, option D is 21.419 GeV, which is higher. Option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close but still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the sum of individual masses without considering binding energy, leading to m0c² =5.6335 GeV. So E=3.57142857 *5.6335 =20.1197 GeV, which would match option C (20.132 GeV) if there's a slight approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the binding energy and use the sum of the individual nucleon masses, leading to E≈20.1197 GeV, which is very close to option C (20.132 GeV).

Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects the energy in the lab frame, but considering only the kinetic energy.

Wait, but earlier, when I computed K with the actual mass, I got about 14.4 GeV, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem made a mistake in the options, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the error is in the calculation of the binding energy.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is 6.014142 u, which is 6.014142 *931.494 MeV/c² =5602.094 MeV =5.602094 GeV.

So, using that, the total energy would be 3.57142857 *5.602094 = about 20.0075 GeV.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in another assumption.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nucleus is moving at 0.96c, so the gamma is correct. But perhaps the problem is considering the rest energy as the sum of the individual nucleon masses, leading to E=20.1197 GeV, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be the kinetic energy, but in that case, the answer would be about 14.4 GeV, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the problem statement. The question says, the energy of the RHIC. RHIC accelerates heavy ions to a certain energy. So the energy here refers to the kinetic energy, perhaps.

Wait, but when they say the energy, sometimes it's the total energy. I'm a bit confused about that. Let me think: in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, they usually refer to the kinetic energy per particle. Or sometimes the total energy.

Wait, but I think in this case, the answer should be the total energy, which is gamma * m0c².

Given that, with m0c²=5.602094 GeV and gamma=3.57142857, the total energy is approximately 20.0075 GeV.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended approach was to ignore the binding energy and use the sum of individual nucleon masses, leading to E=20.1197 GeV, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look at the options again. Option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close to 20.1197 GeV, so perhaps the correct option is C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using a more precise formula.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1 / sqrt(0.0784) ≈3.571428571.

But perhaps I should compute it with more decimal places.

Actually, 0.96^2 =0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, so gamma is exactly 3.5714285714.

So that doesn't change things.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the relativistic energy formula, but using the rest mass in the lab frame, which might include the binding energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons, each moving relativistically, but that complicates things further.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to simply use the formula E=gamma * m_p *c² for each nucleon, but that doesn't make sense because the nucleus is a single entity.

Hmm, I'm going in circles here. The most plausible answer based on my calculations, assuming the rest mass is the sum of the individual nucleon masses, is option C: 20.132 GeV. But if I consider the actual rest mass of Li-6, the energy is about 20.0075 GeV, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps another approach: let's compute the energy using the actual rest mass of Li-6 and see if any of the options match.

E = gamma * m0c² =3.57142857 *5.602094 ≈20.0075 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV, which is about 0.1245 GeV higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely. Let me compute 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96²) using a calculator.

Wait, more precisely, 0.96^2=0.9216.

1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

So gamma is exactly 3.5714285714.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as the non-relativistic kinetic energy formula, but that wouldn't make sense at 0.96c.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the total energy including rest mass.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is referring to the beam energy as the total energy, which is gamma * m0c², which is about 20.1197 GeV when using the sum of individual nucleon masses, leading to option C.

Given all this, I think the intended answer is option C:20.132 GeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) required to accelerate a Li-6 nucleus to a speed of \( 0.96c \), we use relativistic energy equations. The nucleus in question is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, giving it a total of 6 nucleons. The rest mass energy of Li-6 is calculated using its atomic mass, which is approximately \( 6.014142 \, \text{u} \). Converting this to energy using \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), the rest mass energy is:

\[
m_0c^2 = 6.014142 \times 931.494 \, \text{MeV} = 5602.094 \, \text{MeV} = 5.602094 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated using the formula:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
\]

Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 = 0.0784, \quad \sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28, \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} = 3.57142857.
\]

The total energy of the nucleus is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m_0c^2.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 3.57142857 \) and \( m_0c^2 = 5.602094 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
E = 3.57142857 \times 5.602094 = 20.0075 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

This calculation yields a total energy of approximately \( 20.0075 \, \text{GeV} \). However, the problem's options suggest a slightly higher value. If the problem assumes the rest mass energy as the sum of individual nucleon masses (ignoring binding energy), the rest mass energy becomes:

\[
m_0c^2 = 3 \times 938.272 + 3 \times 939.565 = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Recomputing the total energy with this value:

\[
E = 3.57142857 \times 5.633511 = 20.1197 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

This result aligns closely with option C (\( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \)), suggesting the problem may ignore binding energy. Given the options and the calculations, the most reasonable answer is:

**Answer: C**
