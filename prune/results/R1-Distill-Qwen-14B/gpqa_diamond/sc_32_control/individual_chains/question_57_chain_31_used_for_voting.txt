Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about scattering electrons and phase shifts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my scattering theory, but let me think through this.

The problem gives me phase shifts δ₀ to δ₄ as 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13° respectively. The question is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are in fm, which I think stands for fermi meters, a unit of length.

Wait, in scattering theory, I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ, ω) can be expressed using partial waves. The general formula involves a sum over all the phase shifts. Oh right, the formula is something like f(θ, ω) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) exp(iδ_l - i l π/2) - 1 ) * ( sin(lθ) / sin(θ/2) ) ) ... but I might be mixing up some terms here.

Wait, more accurately, the scattering amplitude f is given by a sum over l of ( (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} ( e^{iθ} - e^{i(l+1)π} ) ) / (2i sin(θ/2)) ) multiplied by (something with the energy?), but I'm not sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, I think the imaginary part is often connected to the optical theorem or the unitarity of the S-matrix.

Wait, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 (along the incident direction) might have a specific formula. Oh right, when θ is zero, the scattering is along the beam direction, which is the forward direction.

I recall that for the forward direction (θ=0), the expression simplifies. Let me think. The partial waves are summed up, and for each l, the term becomes (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin(l * 0) / sin(0/2). But wait, sin(0) is zero, so each term except l=0 might be zero? Or am I missing something.

Wait, no, for θ=0, the denominator sin(θ/2) becomes zero, but the numerator sin(lθ) is zero as well. So maybe I should use L’Hospital's rule or expand around θ=0. Alternatively, perhaps there's a simplified formula for the forward scattering amplitude.

Another approach: the scattering amplitude in the forward direction is often related to the imaginary part of the amplitude, which is connected to the total cross-section via the optical theorem. The optical theorem states that the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is proportional to the total cross-section.

Wait, the optical theorem says that (1/(2k)) Im(f(0,ω)) = σ_total /4π, where k is the wave number. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the sum of the individual contributions from each partial wave.

Wait, let's think about the partial wave expansion. The scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ, ω) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l + 1) e^{2i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l) ) / (k sin(θ/2)) )

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude f is given by:

Im(f) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) sin(2δ_l) sin(lθ + δ_l) / sin(θ/2)

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, for the forward direction (θ=0), sin(lθ + δ_l) becomes sin(δ_l), and sin(θ/2) is zero. So maybe using the limit as θ approaches zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the expression for the imaginary part along the beam direction (θ=0) is:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) 

Wait, does that make sense? Because when θ approaches zero, the forward scattering might involve the sum over l of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) / (something), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought. The scattering amplitude f(θ) can be written as:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) [ e^{2iδ_l} ( e^{ilθ} - e^{i(l+1)π} ) ] / ( sin(θ/2) )

But when θ is zero, e^{ilθ} = 1, and e^{i(l+1)π} is (-1)^{l+1}. So substituting θ=0, each term becomes (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} (1 - (-1)^{l+1} ) ] / (2ik * (θ/2) )

Wait, but when θ approaches zero, sin(θ/2) ≈ θ/2, so denominator is θ/(2). So maybe the expression simplifies, but I'm still not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the partial wave expansion for the amplitude. The imaginary part of the amplitude is given by:

Im f(θ) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) sin(2δ_l) (sin(lθ + δ_l)) / sin(θ/2)

But when θ is zero, sin(lθ) becomes zero, but the denominator is also zero. So perhaps using L’Hospital's rule.

Wait, let's take θ approaching zero. So let's consider the term for each l:

(2l + 1) sin(2δ_l) sin(lθ + δ_l) / (2k sin(θ/2))

As θ approaches zero, sin(lθ + δ_l) ≈ lθ, and sin(θ/2) ≈ θ/2. So the numerator becomes (2l +1) sin(2δ_l) * lθ, denominator 2k*(θ/2) = kθ.

So each term becomes (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * lθ / (kθ) ) * (1/(2)) ) ?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the limit as θ approaches zero. Let me see:

Each term in the sum for Im f(0) would be (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * [ lθ + ... ] / (k θ )

So the lθ in numerator and θ in denominator would cancel, leaving (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * l / (k) ) * 1/(2) ?

Wait, but maybe I'm complicating it. Another approach: perhaps the imaginary part at θ=0 is given by the sum over l of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) / (k), but I'm not sure.

Wait, from scattering theory, the optical theorem says that the total cross-section is related to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude.

The total cross-section σ_total is given by:

σ_total = 4π/k² Im(f(0, ω))

So if I can find Im(f(0)), I can find σ_total. But the question is about Im(f(0)), so maybe I don't need σ_total.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is just asking for the sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) divided by (2k), but I'm not certain. Let me think.

Wait, the phase shifts given are for l=0 to l=4: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55, δ₃=30, δ₄=13. So l runs from 0 to 4. Higher l's are ignored.

So I think each term in the sum is (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) for each l. Then Im(f(0)) is (1/(2k)) multiplied by the sum of these terms.

Wait, let me make sure: the formula for the imaginary part of the amplitude along the beam direction (θ=0) is:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) * sum_{l=0}^n (2l+1) sin(2δ_l)

So I can compute each (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) for l=0 to 4, sum them, multiply by 1/(2k), and that gives the imaginary part.

Wait, but what is k? k is the wave number, which is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

Wait, the electrons have energy E=50 MeV. But wait, to compute k, I need to express E in terms of appropriate units. Hmm, this could be a bit tricky.

Wait, the wave number k is given by:

k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ

But wait, in natural units where ħ = c = 1, this simplifies, but I think here E is given in MeV, so we need to work in compatible units.

Wait, the electron mass m is approximately 0.511 MeV/c². So, E=50 MeV.

So m = 0.511 MeV/c², E=50 MeV.

Let's compute k: 

k = sqrt(2 m E) / ħ

But I'm a bit confused about the units here. Let me think in terms of cgs units or something. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to remember that for non-relativistic speeds, but 50 MeV is way beyond non-relativistic. Hmm, maybe I should compute k using the formula k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ, but I need to handle the units correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relation with the wavelength. The Compton wavelength of an electron is about 2.426 × 10^-12 m. But maybe I'm complicating things.

Wait, another approach: The energy E in electron volts (eV) is related to the momentum p via E ≈ pc for high energies (relativistic case). But 50 MeV is relativistic, so E ≈ pc. So p = E/(c) = 50e6 eV * (1.602e-19 J/eV) / (3e8 m/s)

Wait, but perhaps I can find k from p = ħk, so k = p/ħ.

Wait, let me compute p first. If E=50 MeV, then in SI units that's 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.

In the relativistic case, E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ), but since E is much larger than m c² (0.511 MeV ≈ 511e3 eV, E is 5e7 eV), so E ≈ pc. So p ≈ E/(c).

So p ≈ (50e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV) / (3e8 m/s)

Wait, compute that:

50e6 * 1.602e-19 = 8.01e-13 J.

Divide by 3e8 m/s: 8.01e-13 / 3e8 ≈ 2.67e-21 kg m/s.

So p ≈ 2.67e-21 kg m/s.

Then k = p / ħ. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So k ≈ (2.67e-21) / (1.0545718e-34) ≈ 2.53e13 m^-1.

Wait, but that seems very large. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the units.

Wait, E is given in MeV, which is 50 MeV. Let me see if I can find k using another approach, perhaps using the relation with the wavelength.

Another method: The de Broglie wavelength λ is given by λ = ħ/(p). But since E≈pc, p= E/(c), so λ = ħ c / E.

Hmm, let me compute λ.

ħc ≈ 197.327 MeV fm (since 1 fm is 1e-15 m). So,

λ = ħc / E = 197.327 MeV fm / 50 MeV ≈ 3.94654 fm.

So 1/λ = k ≈ 253.6 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that makes sense because 1 fm is 1e-15 m, so 1/fm is 1e15 m^-1.

So converting 253.6 fm^{-1} to m^-1 is 253.6e15 m^-1.

Wait, but in the formula for Im(f(0)), k would be in units of 1/m. Hmm, but the options are in fm, so perhaps I can express k in terms of 1/fm.

Wait, 1 fm = 1e-15 m, so 1 fm^{-1} = 1e15 m^{-1}. So 253.6 fm^{-1} is 253.6e15 m^{-1}, which is 2.536e17 m^{-1}.

Wait, but earlier I found k ≈ 2.53e13 m^{-1} from the first approach, but this gives 2.536e17 m^{-1}. There's a discrepancy here. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the wavelength.

Wait, E = 50 MeV. The Compton wavelength of an electron is λ_c = ħc/(m c^2) = (197.33 MeV fm) / (0.511 MeV) ≈ 386 fm.

But wait, the de Broglie wavelength λ is ħ/(p) = (ħ c)/(E) when E = pc, which is true for high energies.

So λ = (197.33 MeV fm) / (50 MeV) = approx 3.9466 fm.

So 1/λ = k ≈ 253.6 fm^{-1}.

Ah, so k ≈ 253.6 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that would make k in units of 1/fm. So k ≈ 253.6 fm^{-1}.

Now, going back to the formula. Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l )

Each δ_l is given in degrees. So I need to compute sin(2δ_l) for each l.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure we're using radians or degrees. Since the phase shifts are given in degrees, I should convert them to radians before computing the sine.

So for each l: compute (2l+1) * sin( 2 * δ_l * π/180 )

Then sum all these terms and multiply by (1/(2k)).

Let me tabulate each term.

l=0: δ=90°, 2δ=180°, sin(180)=0.

l=1: δ=67°, 2δ=134°, sin(134°)=sin(180-46)=sin(46°)≈0.7193.

l=2: δ=55°, 2δ=110°, sin(110)=sin(70)=approx 0.9397.

l=3: δ=30°, 2δ=60°, sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660.

l=4: δ=13°, 2δ=26°, sin(26)≈0.4384.

Now compute each (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l):

l=0: (1) * 0 = 0.

l=1: (3) * 0.7193 ≈ 2.1579.

l=2: (5) * 0.9397 ≈4.6985.

l=3: (7) * 0.8660 ≈6.062.

l=4: (9) * 0.4384 ≈3.9456.

Sum these values: 0 + 2.1579 +4.6985 +6.062 +3.9456.

Let me add them step by step.

2.1579 +4.6985 =6.8564.

6.8564 +6.062 =12.9184.

12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

So the sum is approximately 16.864.

Now, multiply by 1/(2k). k is 253.6 fm^{-1}, so 1/(2k) =1/(2*253.6) ≈1/(507.2) ≈0.001971 fm.

So Im(f(0)) ≈ 16.864 * 0.001971 fm.

Calculating that: 16.864 * 0.001971 ≈ 0.0330 fm.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are much larger, around 177 fm, 251 fm, etc.

Hmm, something's wrong here. Let me recheck the formula.

Wait, am I missing a factor of 2π or something else? Or perhaps I got the formula wrong.

Wait, another thought. The formula I have might be incorrect. Let me revisit the partial wave expansion.

The general expression for the scattering amplitude f is:

f(θ, ω) = sum_{l=0}^\infty ( (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} (e^{i l θ} - e^{i (l+1) π}) ) / ( 2i k sin(θ/2) ) )

But when θ=0, e^{i l θ} =1, and e^{i(l+1) π} = (-1)^{l+1}.

So each term becomes:

(2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} [1 - (-1)^{l+1} ] / (2i k sin(θ/(2)) )

But this is for θ=0, which would make sin(θ/2) approach zero, so perhaps I should take the limit as θ approaches zero.

Wait, but for small θ, sin(θ/2) ≈ θ/2. So the term becomes:

(2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} [1 - (-1)^{l+1} ] / (2i k (θ/2)) )

Which simplifies to:

(2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} [1 - (-1)^{l+1} ] / (i k θ )

But wait, this seems to lead to each term having a 1/θ factor, which would be problematic as θ approaches zero. So perhaps this approach isn't right.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression for the imaginary part at θ=0 is:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^n (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

But earlier I got about 0.033 fm, which doesn't match any of the options. The options are in the hundreds of fm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units when calculating k. Let me recalculate k more carefully.

E=50 MeV, which is 50e6 eV. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so E =50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.

The rest mass energy of the electron is m c² = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV = 8.17e-14 J.

Since E is much larger than m c², we can approximate E≈pc. So p ≈ E/c = (8.01e-13 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 2.67e-21 kg m/s.

Then, k = p/ħ = (2.67e-21 kg m/s) / (1.0545718e-34 J s) 

Calculating that: 2.67e-21 / 1.0545718e-34 ≈ 2.53e13 m^-1.

Wait, that's 2.53e13 m^-1, which is 2.53e13 (1/m).

But 1 m = 1e15 fm, so 1/m = 1e-15 fm^{-1}.

So 2.53e13 m^-1 = 2.53e13 * 1e-15 fm^{-1} = 2.53e-2 fm^{-1}.

Wait, so k ≈0.0253 fm^{-1}.

That's very different from previous calculation. What did I do wrong earlier?

Wait, earlier I used λ = ħ c / E, which is 197.33 MeV fm / 50 MeV = 3.9466 fm. So 1/λ = k = 0.2536 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but this is conflicting with the previous calculation where k was about 2.53e13 m⁻¹.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the units in the second approach. Let me redo the calculation using the wavelength approach.

Using λ = ħ c / E.

ħc is 197.33 MeV fm.

E=50 MeV.

So λ = 197.33 /50 = ~3.9466 fm.

So k = 2π / λ ≈ 2π /3.9466 fm ≈ 1.6009 fm^{-1}.

Wait, because k = 2π/λ.

Wait, no, wait. k is 2π/λ, but λ is in meters. Wait, but since I'm using lambda in fermis, let's make sure the units are correct.

1 fm = 1e-15 m. So λ =3.9466 fm = 3.9466e-15 m.

So k = 2π / (3.9466e-15 m) ≈ (6.2832) / (3.9466e-15) ≈ 1.6009e15 m^{-1}.

But 1 m⁻¹ is 1e-15 fm⁻¹, so 1.6e15 m⁻¹ = 1.6e15 * 1e-15 fm⁻¹ = 1.6 fm⁻¹.

Ah, I see. So k = approximately 1.6 fm^{-1}.

Wait, this makes more sense. So earlier I messed up the units when calculating k as 2.53e13 m⁻¹. But using the wavelength approach, it's 1.6 fm⁻¹.

Wait, because:

λ = ħ c / E = 197.33 MeV fm /50 MeV = ~3.9466 fm.

So k = 2π / λ = 2π/(3.9466 fm) ≈ 1.6009 fm⁻¹.

Yes, that's correct.

So now, going back to the formula.

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

So with k ≈ 1.6 fm⁻¹.

Sum of terms was 16.864 as before.

So 1/(2k) = 1/(2*1.6) = 1/3.2 ≈ 0.3125 fm.

Multiply by sum: 16.864 * 0.3125 ≈ 5.27 fm.

But none of the options are around 5.27 fm. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im(f(0)) is different. Let me go back.

Wait, I'm now confused. Let me try to find a reference.

Upon checking my notes, I remember that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

So that seems correct.

So let's proceed.

Sum is 16.864.

k=1.6 fm^{-1}.

So Im(f(0)) = (1/(2*1.6)) *16.864 = (1/3.2) *16.864 ≈5.27 fm.

But the options are A) 87163.4 fm, B)355.351 fm, C)177.675 fm, D)251.271 fm.

Hmm, none of these match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, let me double-check the sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ) for each l:

l=0: (1) sin(180°)=0 → 0.

l=1: 3 sin(134°) → 3 * sin(134). Let's calculate sin(134°).

Sin(134) = sin(180-46) = sin(46). Let's compute sin(46°):

Using calculator: sin(46) ≈ 0.7193.

So 3 * 0.7193 = 2.1579.

l=2: 5 sin(110°) → 5 * sin(110). Sin(110)=sin(70)=approx 0.9397.

5 * 0.9397 ≈4.6985.

l=3:7 sin(60)=7*(√3/2)=7*0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:9 sin(26)=9 * approx 0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum: 0 +2.1579 +4.6985 +6.062 +3.9456 = let me add them again.

2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564.

6.8564 +6.062=12.9184.

12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

Yes, same as before.

Hmm, 5.27 fm is not an option. So perhaps my formula is wrong.

Alternative approach: Maybe the formula is (sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )) / (2k).

Wait, that's the same as what I did.

Wait, maybe I should include more phase shifts? The question says to ignore the rest beyond δ4. So l=0 to l=4 are included.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Oh, wait, perhaps the formula is (1/(2ik)) ... ?

Wait, in the formula for f, perhaps the imaginary part is (1/(2k)) times the sum. So, Im(f) would be [1/(2k)] * sum ... , which is what I did.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum in radians. Let me try that.

Wait, I used degrees in the sine function earlier. But perhaps I should convert the angles to radians first.

So 2δ_l in radians:

l=0: 180° = π radians.

l=1: 134° ≈ 2.336 rad.

l=2: 110° ≈1.91986 rad.

l=3: 60°=1.0472 rad.

l=4:26°≈0.4538 rad.

Compute the sine of each in radians.

sin(π)=0.

sin(2.336) ≈ sin(134°)=0.7193.

sin(1.91986)=sin(110)=0.9397.

sin(1.0472)=sin(60)=0.8660.

sin(0.4538)=sin(26)=0.4384.

So same as before. So no change in the sum.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (1/(k)) sum ... instead of (1/(2k)).

If I do that, Im(f(0)) = (1/(2*1.6)) *16.864 ≈5.27 fm.

No, that's the same as before.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the formula is (1/(2k)) times the sum of (2l+1) sin(δ_l) instead of sin(2δ_l).

Wait, but that doesn't fit with the optical theorem. Let me think again.

Wait, the optical theorem says that 4π/k² Im(f(0)) = σ_total.

But the sum for Im(f) would involve sin(2δ_l), because when you expand e^{2iδ_l} -1, you get 2i e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the partial wave expansion correctly.

The partial wave expansion is:

f(θ, ω) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} ( e^{i l θ} - e^{i (l+1) π} ) ] / sin(θ/2)

At θ=0, e^{i l θ}=1, and e^{i (l+1)π }= (-1)^{l+1}.

So, f(0, ω) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} (1 - (-1)^{l+1}) ] / sin(0/2)

But sin(0)=0, so denominator is zero. So we take the limit as θ→0.

Hmm, perhaps using L’Hospital's rule.

Wait, let me expand the numerator and denominator in terms of θ.

The term for each l is:

(2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} [1 - (-1)^{l+1} ] / (2i k sin(θ/2) )

As θ approaches 0, sin(θ/2) ≈ θ/2, so the term becomes:

(2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} [1 - (-1)^{l+1} ] / (2i k * θ/2 )

= (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} [1 - (-1)^{l+1} ] * 2/(2i k θ )

= (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} [1 - (-1)^{l+1} ] / (i k θ )

But as θ → 0, each term would have a 1/θ factor, implying that the amplitude may diverge. That can't be right, so perhaps the sum of all terms leads to a cancellation of θ in the denominator.

But I'm not sure how to proceed. Perhaps another approach is needed.

Alternatively, considering the imaginary part of f(0), which is Im(f(0)).

The imaginary part comes from the imaginary component of each term in the sum. So, each term would contribute Im( ... )

Each term in the sum is (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} [1 - (-1)^{l+1} ] / (i k θ )

At θ=0, perhaps we can write this as:

(2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} [1 - (-1)^{l+1} ] * θ / (i k θ^2) ) = ... Hmm, not sure.

Another approach: the imaginary part is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) (1 - (-1)^{l+1}) )

Wait, because [1 - (-1)^{l+1} ] can be written as 2 if l is even, 0 if l is odd.

Wait, let's see:

For l even: (-1)^{l} =1, so (-1)^{l+1}= -1. So [1 - (-1)^{l+1} ] = 1 - (-1) =2.

For l odd: (-1)^{l+1}=1, so [1 -1 ]=0.

Wait, wait, let me check:

Wait, for l=0, even: (-1)^{0+1}= (-1)^1 = -1. So 1 - (-1) = 2.

l=1, odd: (-1)^{2}=1. 1-1=0.

l=2, even: (-1)^3= -1. 1 - (-1)=2.

l=3, odd: (-1)^4=1. 1-1=0.

l=4, even: (-1)^5= -1. 1 -(-1)=2.

So for even l, [1 - (-1)^(l+1)] =2, for odd l, it's zero.

So only even l contribute. So the sum for Im(f(0)) would be:

(1/(2k)) * sum_{even l} (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * 2 )

Wait, because [1 - (-1)^{l+1} ]=2 for even l.

So the formula becomes:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) * sum_{even l} (2l+1) * 2 sin(2 δ_l )

= (1/(2k)) * 2 sum_{even l} (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l )

= (1/k) sum_{even l} (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l )

Ah! So this changes things. I think I was missing the factor of 2 for even l's.

So, let's recompute the sum, considering only even l's.

Which l's are even? l=0,2,4.

Compute (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) for each even l.

l=0: 1 * sin(180°)=0.

l=2:5 sin(110°)=5 * 0.9397≈4.6985.

l=4:9 sin(26°)=9 * 0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum for even l's: 0 +4.6985 +3.9456=8.6441.

Now, multiply by (1/k): k=1.6 fm^{-1}.

So Im(f(0))= 8.6441 / 1.6 ≈5.4025 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, the options are much larger. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait, perhaps the formula is (1/(2k)) times the sum, which includes all l, but with [1 - (-1)^{l+1} ].

Wait, perhaps the formula doesn't involve sin(2δ_l), but rather e^{2i δ_l} -1.

Wait, another approach: The partial wave expansion for f(θ, ω) is:

f(θ, ω) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} (e^{i l θ} - e^{i (l+1) π} ) ] / sin(θ/2)

At θ=0, this becomes:

f(0, ω) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} (1 - (-1)^{l+1} ) ] / (θ/2 )

Because sin(θ/2) ≈θ/2 when θ is small.

So,

f(0, ω) ≈ (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l} (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} (1 - (-1)^{l+1}) * 2 ] / θ

= (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l} [ (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} (1 - (-1)^{l+1}) * 2 ] /θ 

= [ sum_{l} (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} (1 - (-1)^{l+1}) ] / (i k θ )

Now, taking the imaginary part:

Im(f(0, ω)) = Im [ sum_{l} (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} (1 - (-1)^{l+1}) ] / (k θ )

Because Im(1/(i k θ )) = 1/(k θ ), since i is in denominator.

But wait, 1/(i k θ ) = -i/(k θ ). So the imaginary part would be [ sum terms * (-i) ] * (1/(k θ )).

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute Im of each term.

Each term in the sum is (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} (1 - (-1)^{l+1} )

The imaginary part of this term is (2l+1) [ sin(2δ_l) (1 - (-1)^{l+1}) ]

So Im(f(0)) = [ sum_{l} (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) (1 - (-1)^{l+1}) ] / (k θ )

But wait, this seems to introduce a 1/θ term, which would go to infinity as θ approaches zero. But that can't be right. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for Im(f(0)) is:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l} (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) (1 - (-1)^{l+1}) )

Because (1 - (-1)^{l+1}) is 2 for even l, 0 for odd l.

So, let's compute this:

For each even l:

l=0: (2*0+1) * sin(180) *2 → 1 *0 *2=0.

l=2:5 * sin(110) * 2 →5 *0.9397 *2≈5 *0.9397 *2=9.397.

l=4:9 * sin(26) *2 →9 *0.4384 *2≈9 *0.8768≈7.8912.

Sum: 0 +9.397 +7.8912 =17.2882.

Multiply by (1/(2k)).

k=1.6 fm^-1.

So 1/(2*1.6) =0.3125 fm.

Im(f)=17.2882 *0.3125 ≈5.4025 fm.

Same result as before.

Hmm, but the options are about 177 fm, 251 fm, etc. So I'm off by a factor of about 33.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Earlier, using λ= ħc/E=197.33/50 ≈3.9466 fm. So k=2π/λ≈1.6 fm⁻¹.

But in another approach, I calculated k as 1.6 fm⁻¹, which seems correct.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the formula should have a factor of 2π somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= (sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) (1 - (-1)^{l+1}) )) / (2k (1 - cos θ) )

But when θ approaches zero, 1 - cos θ ≈θ²/2.

Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Im(f(0)) = (sum_{l even} (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) *2 ) / (2k )

Which would be:

sum_even = 4.6985 +3.9456=8.6441. Multiply by 2: 17.2882.

Divide by 2k: 17.2882/(2*1.6 )=17.2882/3.2≈5.4025 fm.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be:

Im(f(0)) = (sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ) / (2k )

But that would give 16.864/(3.2)≈5.27 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ) / (k )

Which would be 16.864/1.6≈10.54 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (1/(2k)) times the sum over l of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) (1 + (-1)^{l} )

Wait, but let me think: for [1 - (-1)^{l+1} ]= 1 + (-1)^{l}.

Wait,

[1 - (-1)^{l+1} ] =1 + (-1)^l.

Because (-1)^{l+1}= - (-1)^l.

So 1 - (-1)^{l+1} =1 + (-1)^l.

So the sum becomes sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) (1 + (-1)^l )

Which for even l (since 1 + (-1)^Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm. The question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I remember from my notes that scattering amplitude has both real and imaginary parts, and they relate to the differential cross-section in some way.

The given phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And they say to ignore the rest, so I guess higher phase shifts beyond δ₄ don't matter here.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by some formula involving the phase shifts. I think the formula is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ [ (u_l)(e^{2iδ_l} - 1) ] * something with spherical harmonics. Oh right, but in the case of elastic scattering and when considering the forward direction (θ=0), the expression might simplify.

Wait, wait. For the imaginary part along the incident direction, which is θ=0°, the formula for the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is (1/(2k)) * Σ [ sin(2δ_l) * (2l + 1) ] / (something). Or maybe more accurately, the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/(2k)) times the sum over l of sin(2δ_l) multiplied by (2l + 1).

Wait, let me think. The general expression for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) (2l +1) P_l(cosθ) ], where P_l are the Legendre polynomials. The imaginary part of f(θ) would then involve the imaginary part of each term.

At θ=0°, P_l(cos 0) is P_l(1) which equals 1 for all l, right? Because P_0(1)=1, P_1(1)=1, etc. Wait no—Wait, no, P_l(1) is 1 for any l. Because the Legendre polynomial P_l(x) evaluated at x=1 is always 1. So for each l, the term becomes (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * (2l+1).

So the scattering amplitude f at θ=0 is (1/(2ik)) multiplied by the sum over l of (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * (2l + 1). Then, the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/(2k)) multiplied by the sum of [Im(e^{2iδ_l} - 1)] * (2l + 1).

Wait, let's compute each term. e^{2iδ_l} is cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l). So e^{2iδ_l} - 1 = (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2δ_l). The imaginary part of this is sin(2δ_l), because the real part is (cos(2δ_l)-1), which doesn't contribute to the imaginary part of f(0) when we take Im(f(0)).

So Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) * sum over l of [ sin(2δ_l) * (2l + 1) ].

Hmm. Now, what's k? Oh, k is the wave number of the electrons. The electrons are at 50 MeV. I need to compute k. I remember that the relation between the energy E and the wave number k is E = (ħ² k²)/(2m), but wait, for electrons, units can be tricky.

Wait, let's get the formula right. The Compton wavelength might come into play here. The wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/(ħ). Or perhaps E = (ħ² k²)/(2m_e c²) if we're using natural units with c and other constants.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in terms of the electron's energy. Let me think about the units. E is given in MeV. Let's see, the rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV. So E (50 MeV) is much larger than the rest mass, so relativistic effects are important. Hmm, but wait, this is about an electron with kinetic energy 50 MeV, but in reality, the total energy would be E = K + m c². So in this case, K =50 MeV, so E ≈ 50.511 MeV, but perhaps for high E, we can approximate E ≈ 50 MeV.

Wait, the formula for the de Broglie wavelength is λ = h / (p), where p is the momentum. And k is p/ħ. So k = p / ħ.

The relativistic energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2. So p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

But E is 50 MeV, and m c² is 0.511 MeV, so E ≈ 50 MeV is much larger than m c². So I can approximate p ≈ E/(c). Then, p ≈ (50 MeV)/(c).

Wait, but let's get precise. Let me compute p in terms of E.

E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 )

So (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2 )^2 => p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2 )^2 ) / c.

So plug in E=50 MeV and m c²=0.511 MeV. So E^2 is (50)^2 = 2500 (MeV)^2, and (m c^2)^2 is (0.511)^2 ≈ 0.261 (MeV)^2. So E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ≈ 2500 - 0.261 ≈ 2499.739 (MeV^2).

So p = sqrt(2499.739) / c ≈ 49.9974 MeV/c.

So p ≈ 50 MeV/c.

Then, k = p/(ħ c) * c? Wait, no, wait. k is p/(ħ), but p is in units of MeV/c. So let's make sure I get the units right.

Wait, Planck's constant ħ has units of J·s. But perhaps it's easier to express everything in terms that make the calculation easier. Let's think in terms of natural units where c=1, but perhaps that's complicating.

Alternatively, let's compute k. Since k is p/(ħ), where p is in kg·m/s. So I need to convert p into SI units.

But that's going to be a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps use the relation k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ, but wait, that's the non-relativistic formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the relativistic expression.

Wait, perhaps the formula for k in terms of the electron's energy is known. Let me think. The Compton wavelength for the electron is λ_c = 2πħ/(m_e c). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express k as (E)/(ħ c) * sqrt(1 - (m c^2)/E ). But since E is 50 MeV and m c^2 is 0.511 MeV, the term (m c^2)/E is about 0.01, so sqrt(1 - 0.01) ≈ 0.99499.

Wait, let me compute that. So E is about 50 MeV, so m c² is 0.511 MeV, so (m c²)/E ≈ 0.511/50 = ~0.01022.

So sqrt(1 - 0.01022) ≈ 0.9949.

So p ≈ E/(c) * sqrt(1 - (m c^2)/(E)).

Wait, but E is the total energy. So E = gamma m c².

Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to compute the momentum p in terms of E.

p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 )

So p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c.

But E is in MeV, and m c^2 is 0.511 MeV.

So E =50 MeV.

p = sqrt(50^2 - (0.511)^2) MeV/c ≈ sqrt(2500 - 0.261) ≈ sqrt(2499.739) ≈ 49.9974 MeV/c.

So p ≈ 50 MeV/c.

Now, Planck's constant ħ is approximately 197.327 MeV·fm. Wait, yes, because 1 fm is 1e-15 meters. So ħ c is about 197.3 MeV·fm.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me make sure.

The value of ħ c in units of MeV·fm is 197.327 MeV·fm. So ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So k is p/(ħ).

p is in units of MeV/c. ħ is in MeV·fm/(c), since ħ c is 197.33 MeV·fm. So ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c.

So p is (50 MeV/c).

So k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV·fm)/c ) ) = (50) / (197.33 fm) ) ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Wait, let me compute that. 50 / 197.33 is approximately 0.253.

So k ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So 1/(2k) would be 1/(2 * 0.253) ≈ 1/0.506 ≈ 1.976 fm.

So 1/(2k) ≈ 1.976 fm.

Now, going back to the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) * sum [ sin(2δ_l) * (2l + 1) ]

So for each l, compute sin(2 δ_l) * (2l +1 ), then sum all contributions, then multiply by 1.976 fm.

Wait, what are the l values here? The given phase shifts are δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, δ₄. So l=0,1,2,3,4.

So compute each term:

l=0: δ₀=90°. sin(2*90°) = sin(180°) = 0. So this term is 0.

l=1: δ₁=67°. 2δ=134°. sin(134) is sin(180-46)= sin(46)≈0.7193. So term is 0.7193 * (2*1 +1 )= 0.7193 *3≈ 2.1579.

l=2: δ₂=55°. 2δ=110°. sin(110)= sin(70)≈0.9397. Term: 0.9397 *5=4.6985.

l=3: δ=30°. 2δ=60°. sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660. Term:0.8660 *7≈6.062.

l=4: δ=13°. 2δ=26°. sin(26)≈0.4384. Term: 0.4384 *9≈ 3.9456.

Now sum all these terms:

0 (l=0) + 2.1579 (l=1) +4.6985 (l=2) +6.062 (l=3) +3.9456 (l=4) = let's add them step by step.

2.1579 +4.6985 =6.8564

6.8564 +6.062 =12.9184

12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

So sum is approximately 16.864.

Multiply by 1/(2k)=1.976 fm.

So Im(f(0))=16.864 *1.976 ≈ let's compute:

16 *2=32. 0.864 *1.976≈ 1.708.

So 16 *1.976=31.616; 0.864 *1.976≈1.708.

Total: approx 31.616 +1.708≈33.324 fm.

Wait, but wait: 16.864 *1.976.

Wait, maybe better to compute it accurately:

16.864 × 1.976.

Let me compute 16 *1.976=31.616.

0.864 × 1.976:

0.8 *1.976=1.5808.

0.064 *1.976≈0.126464.

So total 1.5808 +0.126464=1.707264.

So 31.616 +1.707264=33.323264 fm.

So approximately 33.323 fm.

Wait, but none of the options are near 33 fm. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm. So my calculation gives about 33 fm, which isn't among the options. That's a problem.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation somewhere?

Let me double-check the steps.

First, the formula for Im(f(0)).

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) * sum [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ]

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the formula. Oh wait, perhaps I forgot that in the formula, the sum is over l, and each term is (2l+1) multiplied by the imaginary part of [e^{2iδ_l} -1], which is sin(2δ_l).

But wait, for each l, the term is (e^{2iδ} -1) = (cos 2δ -1) + i sin 2δ. So the imaginary part is sin 2δ. So that part is correct.

Wait, but when I calculated 1/(2k) as 1.976 fm, I think that's the correct value. But let me make sure.

k = p/(ħ). p is 50 MeV/c. ħ c is 197.33 MeV·fm. So ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm)/c.

So, p is in MeV/c.

So, k = p/(ħ) = (50 MeV/c) / ( 197.33 MeV·fm /c ) ) = 50/(197.33) 1/fm ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So 1/(2k) = 1/(2 *0.253) = 1/0.506 ≈1.976 fm.

Yes, that part is correct.

Then, let's recheck the sum of the terms.

Compute each term:

l=0: δ=90° → 2δ=180° → sin(180)=0 → term 0.

l=1: δ=67 → 2δ=134. sin(134)=sin(180-46)=sin(46)≈0.7193. So (2l+1)=3 → 0.7193 ×3≈2.1579.

l=2: δ=55 → 2δ=110. sin(110)=sin(180-70)=sin70≈0.9397. (2l+1)=5 → 0.9397 ×5 ≈4.6985.

l=3: δ=30 → 2δ=60 → sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660. (2l+1)=7 → 0.8660 ×7≈6.062.

l=4: δ=13 → 2δ=26 → sin(26)= approximately 0.4384. 2l+1=9 → 0.4384 ×9≈3.9456.

So adding them: 2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564. 6.8564 +6.062=12.9184. 12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

So sum is 16.864.

Multiply by 1/(2k)=1.976 fm → 16.864 ×1.976 ≈33.323 fm.

But none of the options match that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for Im(f(0)). Let me think again.

The general formula for f(θ) is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) P_l(cosθ).

At θ=0, P_l=1 for all l, so f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1).

The imaginary part of f(0) is Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum [ Im(e^{2iδ_l} -1) ] (2l+1).

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute Im(f(0)).

f(0) is (1/(2ik)) sum (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1).

So Im(f(0)) = Im [ (1/(2ik)) sum (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) ]

Hmm, because 1/(2ik) is a complex factor. Let me compute it.

1/(2ik) = -i/(2k) since 1/i = -i.

So, 1/(2ik) = (-i)/(2k).

So, f(0) = sum (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) * (-i)/(2k).

So f(0) as a function of these terms is a sum of terms each multiplied by (-i)/(2k).

The imaginary part of f(0) would then be the imaginary part of each term in the sum.

Each term is (e^{2iδ_l} -1) * (-i) / (2k) * (2l+1).

Let me compute (e^{2iδ} -1) * (-i) = (-i)(e^{2iδ} -1) = (-i e^{2iδ} +i).

So, the imaginary part of this is the coefficient of i.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the imaginary part of the entire expression.

Alternatively, let's compute each term's contribution to the imaginary part.

Let me think. Let me write (e^{2iδ} -1) as A + i B, where A = cos(2δ) -1, B = sin(2δ).

Then, (e^{2iδ} -1)* (-i) = (A + i B)(-i) = -i A + B.

So, the imaginary part is B, since -i A is purely imaginary, and B is real. Wait, no: 

Wait, (A + i B) * (-i) = -i A -i^2 B = -i A + B. Because i^2 is -1.

So, the result is B + (-i A). So the entire expression is (B) + (-i A).

So, when considering the term in f(0), which is [ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) * (-i) ] * (2l+1) / (2k).

This term's imaginary part is (2l+1) * B / (2k), because the real part is B/(2k) and the imaginary part is (-A)/(2k).

Wait, no. Because the expression is [ (e^{2iδ} -1) * (-i) ] / (2k) * (2l+1) = [ (-i (e^{2iδ} -1) ) * (2l+1) ] / (2k).

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1).

So, 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k), so f(0) = [ -i/(2k) ] * sum (e^{2iδ_l} -1)(2l+1).

So each term in the sum is multiplied by -i/(2k).

So, for each term, the contribution to f(0) is [ -i (e^{2iδ} -1) (2l+1) ] / (2k).

To get the imaginary part of f(0), we can compute the imaginary parts of each of these terms.

Each term is [ -i (e^{2iδ} -1) (2l+1) ] / (2k).

Let me write (e^{2iδ} -1) as [ cos(2δ) -1 ] + i sin(2δ).

So, (e^{2iδ} -1) = C + i D, where C = cos(2δ) -1 and D = sin(2δ).

Then, multiplying by -i gives:

-i (C + i D ) = -i C - i^2 D = -i C + D.

So the term becomes [ (-i C + D) * (2l+1) ] / (2k).

The imaginary part of this is [ (-C) * (2l+1) ] / (2k) .

Because the term is [ D (2l+1) ] / (2k) + [ (-C (2l+1)) / (2k) ] i.

So the imaginary part of each term in the sum is [ (-C (2l+1)) ] / (2k).

But C is [ cos(2δ) -1 ].

So, Im(f(0)) is the sum over l of [ (- (cos(2δ) -1) (2l+1) ) ] / (2k).

Wait, but earlier, I thought the imaginary part was sum [ sin(2δ) (2l+1) ] / (2k).

But now, according to this, Im(f(0)) is sum [ (1 - cos(2δ)) (2l+1) ] / (2k).

Hmm, this is different from what I did before. So where did I make the mistake earlier?

Ah, I think I confused the formula. The correct expression for Im(f(0)) is sum [ (1 - cos(2δ_l)) (2l+1) ] / (2k).

Wait, but that's different from before. So the earlier approach that I thought was correct might be wrong.

Wait, that complicates things. Let me reevaluate.

So the correct formula for Im(f(0)) is sum [ (1 - cos(2δ_l)) (2l+1) ] / (2k).

Hmm, but this changes everything. Let me recompute all the terms.

So, for each l:

Term = (1 - cos(2δ_l)) * (2l +1) / (2k) 

Wait, but 2k is 0.506 fm⁻¹, so 1/(2k) is approximately 1.976 fm.

So let's compute each term:

l=0: δ=90°. 2δ=180°. cos(180) = -1. So 1 - (-1) =2. So term: 2 *1 (since 2l+1=1) → 2 *1=2. Multiply by 1.976 fm: 2 *1.976 ≈3.952 fm.

l=1: δ=67°. 2δ=134°. cos(134)=cos(180-46)= -cos(46)≈-0.6947. So 1 - (-0.6947)=1 +0.6947=1.6947. (2l+1)=3 → term:1.6947 *3=5.0841. Multiply by 1.976 →5.0841 *1.976 ≈10.08 fm.

l=2: δ=55°. 2δ=110°. cos(110)=cos(180-70)= -cos70≈-0.3420. So 1 - (-0.3420)=1.3420. (2l+1)=5 →1.342 *5=6.71. Multiply by 1.976 → 6.71 *1.976 ≈13.26 fm.

l=3: δ=30°. 2δ=60°. cos(60)=0.5 →1 -0.5=0.5. (2l+1)=7 →0.5 *7=3.5. Multiply by 1.976 →3.5 *1.976≈6.916 fm.

l=4: δ=13°. 2δ=26°. cos(26)≈0.8988. So 1 -0.8988=0.1012. (2l+1)=9 →0.1012 *9≈0.9108. Multiply by 1.976 →0.9108 *1.976≈1.800 fm.

Now sum all these contributions:

l=0:3.952

l=1:10.08 → sum so far 14.032

l=2:13.26 → sum 27.292

l=3:6.916 → sum 34.208

l=4:1.800 → total sum 36.008 fm.

Wait, that's about 36 fm. But the options are around 178 fm, 251 fm, etc. So that's not matching either.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should check if I got the formula right. Let me look up the formula for the scattering amplitude.

The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) (2l+1) P_l(cosθ) ]

So Im(f(θ)) = Im [ (1/(2ik)) Σ ... ]

But 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k).

So f(θ) = -i/(2k) Σ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) P_l(cosθ).

Then, Im(f(θ)) is the imaginary part of this.

Each term in the sum is (-i/(2k)) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) P_l(cosθ).

So for θ=0°, P_l(1)=1.

So each term is (-i/(2k)) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1).

The imaginary part of each term is the imaginary part of [ (-i/(2k)) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) ].

Let me compute this.

(e^{2iδ} -1) = (cos2δ -1) + i sin2δ.

Multiply by (-i/(2k)):

(-i/(2k)) [ (cos2δ -1) + i sin2δ ] = (-i/(2k))(cos2δ -1) + (-i^2/(2k)) sin2δ

= (-i (cos2δ -1) )/(2k) ) + (sin2δ)/(2k).

So the imaginary part is (cos2δ -1)/(2k) multiplied by (-1), because the first term is -i times something, which contributes to the imaginary part as negative the real part.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute Im(f(0)) as the imaginary part of each term.

The term is: (-i/(2k)) * (C + i D), where C = (cos2δ-1) and D=sin2δ.

So:

(-i/(2k)) * (C + i D) = (-i C)/(2k) - (i^2 D)/(2k) )

= [ (-i C) + D ] / (2k )

So the real part is D/(2k), and the imaginary part is (-C)/(2k).

So Im(f(0)) is the sum over l of [ (-C) (2l +1) ] / (2k ), where C = cos(2δ_l) -1.

Wait, but that would make Im(f(0)) = sum [ (1 - cos(2δ_l)) (2l +1) ] / (2k ), because -C = -(cos2δ -1) = 1 - cos2δ.

Wait, that makes sense. So yes, Im(f(0)) = sum [ (1 - cos(2δ_l)) (2l +1) ] / (2k ).

So I should have used that instead of sin(2δ).

So my initial approach was incorrect, and I should have used 1 - cos(2δ) instead of sin(2δ).

So let's recalculate everything.

So, Im(f(0)) = sum [ (1 - cos(2δ_l)) (2l +1) ] / (2k )

Again, compute each term.

Given:

k ≈0.253 fm⁻¹ → 1/(2k) ≈1.976 fm.

Compute each term:

l=0: δ=90°. 2δ=180°. cos(180)= -1 →1 - (-1)=2. (2l+1)=1. Term: 2 *1 =2. Multiply by 1.976: 2 *1.976=3.952 fm.

l=1: δ=67°. 2δ=134°. cos134= cos(180-46)= -cos46≈-0.6947. 1 - (-0.6947)=1.6947. (2l+1)=3 →1.6947 *3 ≈5.0841. Multiply by 1.976:5.0841 *1.976 ≈10.08 fm.

l=2: δ=55°. 2δ=110°. cos110= -cos70≈-0.3420. 1 - (-0.3420)=1.342. (2l+1)=5 →1.342 *5=6.71. Multiply by 1.976 →6.71 *1.976≈13.26 fm.

l=3: δ=30°. 2δ=60°. cos60=0.5 →1 -0.5=0.5. (2l+1)=7 →0.5 *7=3.5. Multiply by 1.976→3.5 *1.976≈6.916 fm.

l=4: δ=13°. 2δ=26°. cos26≈0.8988. 1 -0.8988=0.1012. (2l+1)=9 →0.1012 *9≈0.9108. Multiply by 1.976 →0.9108 *1.976≈1.800 fm.

Now sum all contributions:

l=0:3.952

l=1:10.08 → sum 14.032

l=2:13.26 → sum 27.292

l=3:6.916 → sum 34.208

l=4:1.8 → sum 36.008 fm.

Wait, that's about 36.008 fm. Still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of k.

E is 50 MeV. The electron's rest mass is 0.511 MeV, so E is much larger. So relativistic calculations are needed.

The momentum p is given by p = sqrt( (E/c)^2 - (m c)^2 )^(1/2). Wait, no, the correct formula is p = sqrt( (E/(c))^2 - (m c)^2 ) ) / c. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to write it properly.

The energy E is related to momentum p by E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

E is 50 MeV, m c² is 0.511 MeV.

So p = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2 ) / c ≈sqrt(2500 - 0.261) / c ≈49.997 MeV/c.

Now, ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm.

So, ħ c ≈197.33 MeV fm → ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

So, k = p/(ħ) = (49.997 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV fm)/c ) ) = (49.997)/(197.33) (fm⁻¹) ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

So, 1/(2k) = 1/(2 * 0.253 ) ≈1.976 fm.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude multiplied by something else. Or perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, the problem says "the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction." So when θ=0, it's along the beam direction.

Wait, but in the formula, Im(f(0)) is the imaginary part, but perhaps we're to find the imaginary part in terms of the differential cross-section.

Wait, the differential cross-section is given by |f(θ)|², but that's not directly relevant here. The question is about Im(f(0)).

Wait, maybe I'm missing a factor of 2.

Wait, let me recheck the formula for f(θ).

Another source says that the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l +1) P_l(cosθ).

Thus, Im(f(θ)) is the imaginary part of that. So, perhaps when θ=0, the formula is correct as before.

Wait, but if the calculation results in ≈36 fm, and the options are much higher, perhaps I missed a factor.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for Im(f(0)) should have a factor of 2 because the sum is multiplied by 1/(2k), but perhaps I'm missing a factor from the derivative or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the units of k.

Wait, k is in units of 1/fm. So 1/(2k) would be fm.

Each term in the sum is (1 - cos(2δ)) * (2l+1) → dimensionless, multiplied by 1/(2k) in fm.

So the result is in fm, which matches the options.

But according to the calculation, the sum is 36 fm, but the options are around 177 fm, 251 fm, etc.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (1 - cos(2δ)).

Wait, let me recompute each term again.

l=0: δ=90° → 2δ=180° → cos= -1 →1 - (-1)=2.

(2l+1)=1 → 2 *1=2. 2 *1.976=3.952 fm.

l=1: δ=67° → 2δ=134° → cos(134)≈-0.6947.

1 - (-0.6947)=1.6947.

(2l+1)=3 → 1.6947 *3=5.0841. Multiply by 1.976 →5.0841 *1.976 ≈10.08 fm.

l=2: δ=55° →2δ=110° → cos(110)≈-0.3420.

1 - (-0.3420)=1.3420.

(2l+1)=5 →1.3420 *5=6.71. 6.71 *1.976≈13.26 fm.

l=3: δ=30° →2δ=60° → cos60=0.5 → 1-0.5=0.5.

(2l+1)=7 →0.5 *7=3.5. 3.5 *1.976≈6.916 fm.

l=4: δ=13° →2δ=26° → cos26≈0.8988 →1-0.8988≈0.1012.

(2l+1)=9 →0.1012 *9≈0.9108. 0.9108 *1.976≈1.800 fm.

Adding them all gives 3.952 +10.08 +13.26 +6.916 +1.8 = let's compute:

3.952 +10.08=14.032

14.032 +13.26=27.292

27.292 +6.916=34.208

34.208 +1.8=36.008 fm.

Hmm. So 36.0 fm. But none of the options are near this value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another possibility is that the formula for Im(f(0)) is sum [ sin(2δ_l) (2l+1) ] / (2k).

Wait, but earlier, that led to around 33 fm, which also doesn't match any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for Im(f) is (1/(2k)) sum [ sin(δ_l) ] × something. Or perhaps I've mixed up the factors.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is asking for the total cross-section instead of the scattering amplitude. No, the question specifies the scattering amplitude.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the term (1 - cos(2δ)) as 2 sin²δ.

Because 1 - cos(2δ) = 2 sin²δ.

So, Im(f(0)) = sum [ 2 sin²δ_l (2l+1) ] / (2k ) → sum [ sin²δ_l (2l+1) ] / k.

So, let me compute it that way.

k ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

So, compute each term as [ sin²δ_l (2l+1) ] / 0.253.

So,

l=0: sin²90 =1 →1 *1=1 →1/0.253=3.952 fm.

l=1: sin²67 ≈ (0.9205)^2≈0.8474 →0.8474 *3=2.542 →2.542/0.253≈9.99 fm.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait no, because the formula is sum [ (2l+1) * sin²δ ] / k.

So,

l=0: 1 *1 →1/0.253≈3.952 fm.

l=1: 3* sin²67 →3 * (sin67)^2.

sin67≈0.9205 → sin²≈0.8474. So 3*0.8474=2.542. 2.542/0.253≈9.99 fm.

l=2:5 * sin²55 →5*(0.8192)^2=5*(0.6710)=3.355. 3.355 /0.253≈13.25 fm.

l=3:7 * sin²30 →7*(0.5)^2=7*(0.25)=1.75. 1.75/0.253≈6.917 fm.

l=4:9 * sin²13 →9*(0.22495)^2=9*(0.0506)=0.4554. 0.4554 /0.253≈1.800 fm.

Now sum all these:

3.952 +9.99=13.942

13.942 +13.25=27.192

27.192 +6.917=34.109

34.109 +1.8=35.909 fm.

Still about 35.9 fm. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Another possibility is that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by (1/(2k)) sum [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ].

So let's recompute that way.

Each term is (2l+1) sin(2δ).

Compute each term:

l=0: sin(180)=0 → term 0.

l=1: sin(134)=sin(46)=0.7193. 3 *0.7193≈2.158. Multiply by 1.976 →2.158 *1.976≈4.27 fm.

l=2: sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9397.5 *0.9397≈4.6985. Multiply by 1.976 →4.6985 *1.976≈9.30 fm.

l=3: sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660.7 *0.8660≈6.062. Multiply by 1.976 →6.062 *1.976≈12.00 fm.

l=4: sin(26)=0.4384.9 *0.4384≈3.9456. Multiply by 1.976 →3.9456 *1.976≈7.80 fm.

Now sum all:

4.27 +9.30=13.57

13.57 +12=25.57

25.57 +7.80=33.37 fm.

Still about 33 fm. Not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption about the formula is incorrect. Let me think again.

Another approach is to consider that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude f(θ=0) is proportional to the sum of (2l +1) times sin(2δ_l), multiplied by 1/(2k).

But according to the options, the correct answer is 177.675 fm (option C), which is about 178 fm. Let's see if that could be achieved.

Wait, that would be about 5 times larger than our previous estimate of 36 fm. So perhaps I forgot a factor of 5 or something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let's recheck.

Wait, earlier, I calculated k as 0.253 fm⁻¹. Let me recheck.

E=50 MeV, m=0.511 MeV.

p = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) / c ≈50 MeV/c.

ħ c =197.33 MeV fm.

k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / ( (197.33 MeV fm)/c ) ) =50/197.33 ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is different. What if the formula is f(θ) = (1/k) sum ... ? Let me think.

Wait, another source says that the scattering amplitude is given by f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (e^{2iδ_l} -1)(2l+1) P_l(cosθ).

If that's the case, then the earlier approach is correct.

But I'm stuck because none of the calculations match the options.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the scattering amplitude's imaginary part in terms of the optical theorem, which relates the imaginary part to the total cross-section. But I'm not sure how that would directly give the imaginary part at θ=0.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians instead of degrees. Oh! I almost forgot that possibility. Did the question give the phase shifts in degrees or radians?

The question says δ_o=90°, etc., so they are in degrees. So I must convert degrees to radians when computing the sine and cosine.

Ah, that's a crucial mistake I made earlier. All calculations were done in degrees, but in reality, the functions should be computed using radians.

So, let's recompute all the terms correctly, converting degrees to radians.

Let me start over.

First, compute each sin(2δ_l) correctly, using radians.

Wait, no: earlier, I was using the formula Im(f(0)) = sum [ (1 - cos(2δ_l)) (2l+1) ] / (2k )

But if δ is in degrees, then 2δ is in degrees, which I must convert to radians before computing cos and sin.

So, let's recompute each term with this correction.

Compute for each l:

l=0: δ=90° → 2δ=180° → radians: π → cos(π) =-1 →1 - (-1)=2.

Term:2 *1=2 →2 *1.976=3.952 fm.

l=1: δ=67° →2δ=134° → radians: 134 * π/180 ≈2.34 radians.

cos(134°) = cos(2.34) ≈-0.6947.

1- (-0.6947)=1.6947. Multiply by (2*1+1)=3 →1.6947 *3=5.0841 →5.0841 *1.976≈10.08 fm.

l=2: δ=55° →2δ=110° → radians ≈1.91986 radians.

cos(110°)=cos(1.91986)= approx -0.3420.

1 - (-0.3420)=1.342. Multiply by5 →6.71 →6.71 *1.976≈13.26 fm.

l=3: δ=30° →2δ=60° → radians≈1.0472.

cos(60°)=0.5 →1 -0.5=0.5. Multiply by7→3.5 →3.5 *1.976≈6.916 fm.

l=4: δ=13° →2δ=26° → radians≈0.4538.

cos(26°)=cos(0.4538)≈0.8988 →1 -0.8988=0.1012.

Multiply by9→0.9108 →0.9108 *1.976≈1.800 fm.

So, same as before, sum is 36.008 fm.

Wait, but the options are way higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, not degrees. But the question specifies degrees with the degree symbol.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used sin(δ_l) instead of sin(2δ_l).

Wait, going back to the formula.

If the formula for Im(f(0)) is sum [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] / (2k ), but with δ in radians.

Let me recalculate with degrees converted to radians.

Compute each term as (2l+1) sin(2δ) where δ is in degrees, but converted to radians.

l=0: δ=90° →2δ=180° → radians=π → sin(π)=0 → term=0.

l=1: δ=67° →2δ=134° → radians=2.34 → sin(2.34)≈0.7193. (2l+1)=3 →3 *0.7193≈2.158 → multiply by1.976→2.158 *1.976≈4.27 fm.

l=2: δ=55° →2δ=110° → radians≈1.91986 → sin(1.91986)=0.9397. (2l+1)=5 →5 *0.9397≈4.6985. Multiply by1.976→4.6985 *1.976≈9.30 fm.

l=3: δ=30° →2δ=60° → radians=1.0472 → sin(1.0472)=√3/2≈0.8660. (2l+1)=7 →7 *0.866≈6.062. Multiply by1.976→6.062 *1.976≈12.00 fm.

l=4: δ=13° →2δ=26° → radians≈0.4538 → sin(0.4538)=0.4384. (2l+1)=9 →9 *0.4384≈3.9456. Multiply by1.976→3.9456 *1.976≈7.80 fm.

Sum all:

4.27 +9.30=13.57

13.57 +12=25.57

25.57 +7.80=33.37 fm.

So about 33.37 fm. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another approach is to consider that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is proportional to the sum [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ] divided by something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum [ (2l +1) sin(δ_l) ].

Wait, that would change everything.

Let me try that.

Compute each term as (2l+1) sin(δ_l) → then multiply by 1/(2k)=1.976 fm.

l=0: δ=90° →sin(90)=1 →1 *1=1 →1 *1.976=1.976 fm.

l=1: δ=67° →sin≈0.9205 →3 *0.9205≈2.7615 →2.7615 *1.976≈5.46 fm.

l=2: δ=55° →sin≈0.8192 →5 *0.8192≈4.096 →4.096 *1.976≈8.08 fm.

l=3: δ=30° →sin=0.5 →7 *0.5=3.5 →3.5 *1.976≈6.916 fm.

l=4: δ=13° →sin≈0.22495 →9 *0.22495≈2.02455 →2.02455 *1.976≈4.00 fm.

Sum:1.976 +5.46=7.436 →+8.08=15.516 →+6.916=22.432 →+4.00=26.432 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Perhaps the correct approach is to compute the sum as the given options suggest and see which one fits.

Looking at the options, option C is 177.675 fm, which is about 178 fm. Let's see what would that imply.

If Im(f(0))=177.675 fm, then sum [ (1 - cos(2δ_l)) (2l+1) ] = Im(f(0)) * 2k.

2k= 2 *0.253=0.506 fm⁻¹.

So sum = 177.675 fm *0.506 fm⁻¹ ≈ 177.675 *0.506 ≈89.91 fm × fm⁻¹ → unitless? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the sum being sum [ (1 - cos(2δ_l)) (2l+1) ] = Im(f(0)) * 2k.

Wait, Im(f(0)) = sum [ ... ] / (2k ).

So sum = Im(f(0)) * 2k.

If Im(f(0)) is 177.675 fm, then sum would be 177.675 * 2 *0.253 ≈177.675 *0.506 ≈ 89.91.

Hmm, let's compute what each term contributes to sum.

Wait, for sum [ (1 - cos(2δ_l)) (2l+1) ] to be ~90.

Looking back, in our previous calculation, sum was ~36 when using 1 - cos(2δ).

But 36 is much less than 90. So perhaps the phase shifts are given in a different way, or perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the sum should include a factor of (2l+1) multiplied by sin^2(δ_l) times 2, which would give a sum of about 90.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is option C, 177.675 fm, which is about 177.7 fm.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the sum with the correct use of radians for the phase shifts.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in computing 1 - cos(2δ) in radians.

Let me recompute each term using radians.

l=0: δ=90° → π/2 radians. 2δ=π → cos(π)=-1 →1 - (-1)=2. (2l+1)=1 →2 *1=2. Multiply by 1.976 →3.952 fm.

l=1: δ=67° → 67*(π/180)=1.16937 radians. 2δ=134°=2.3408 radians. cos(2.3408)=approx -0.6947.

1 - (-0.6947)=1.6947. Multiply by3=5.0841 →5.0841 *1.976≈10.08 fm.

l=2: δ=55° →55*(π/180)=0.95993 radians. 2δ=110°=1.91986 radians. cos(1.91986)= approx -0.3420.

1 - (-0.3420)=1.342. Multiply by5=6.71 →6.71 *1.976≈13.26 fm.

l=3: δ=30° →30*(π/180)=0.52359 radians. 2δ=60°=1.0472 radians. cos(1.0472)=0.5 →1 -0.5=0.5. Multiply by7=3.5 →3.5 *1.976≈6.916 fm.

l=4: δ=13° →13*(π/180)=0.22689 radians. 2δ=26°=0.45377 radians. cos(0.45377)= approx 0.8988.

1 -0.8988=0.1012. Multiply by9=0.9108 →0.9108 *1.976≈1.800 fm.

Sum is 3.952 +10.08 +13.26 +6.916 +1.800= 36.008 fm.

Hmm. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again. Another possibility is that the formula for the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is sum [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ] / (2k ).

But let's compute that.

Each term is (2l+1) sin(δ_l).

l=0:90° → sin=1 →1*1=1 →1 *1.976=1.976.

l=1:67°→ sin≈0.9205 →3 *0.9205=2.7615 →2.7615 *1.976≈5.46.

l=2:55→ sin≈0.8192 →5 *0.8192=4.096 →4.096 *1.976≈8.08.

l=3:30→ sin=0.5 →7 *0.5=3.5 →3.5 *1.976≈6.916.

l=4:13→ sin≈0.22495 →9 *0.22495=2.02455 →2.02455 *1.976≈4.00.

Sum:1.976 +5.46=7.436 +8.08=15.516 +6.916=22.432 +4.00=26.432 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is sum [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ] multiplied by (1/(2k)).

But that gives 26.432, not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be sum [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ] multiplied by (1/k).

1/k ≈3.952 fm.

So compute each term:

l=0:1*1 →1 *3.952=3.952 fm.

l=1:3*0.9205=2.7615 →2.7615 *3.952≈10.90 fm.

l=2:5*0.8192=4.096 →4.096 *3.952≈16.17 fm.

l=3:7*0.5=3.5 →3.5 *3.952≈13.83 fm.

l=4:9*0.22495=2.02455 →2.02455 *3.952≈8.00 fm.

Sum:3.952 +10.90=14.852 +16.17=31.022 +13.83=44.852 +8.00=52.852 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option C, 177.675 fm. But I can't see where that would come from with the given phase shifts and the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for Im(f(0)) is sum [ (2l+1) ] multiplied by some factor. But I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is (1/(2k)) sum [ (2l+1) ] × something else.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let me think about the expression for the differential cross-section.

The differential cross-section is given by dσ/dΩ = |f(θ)|².

But the question is about Im(f(0)), not the cross-section.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(θ)) = (1/(2k)) sum [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) P_l(cosθ) ]

At θ=0, P_l=1, so Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ]

So let's compute that.

Each term is (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) → then multiply by 1.976.

l=0: sin(180)=0 → term 0.

l=1: sin(134°)=sin(134)=0.7193 →3 *0.7193=2.158 →2.158 *1.976≈4.27 fm.

l=2: sin(110)=0.9397 →5 *0.9397=4.6985 →4.6985 *1.976≈9.30 fm.

l=3: sin(60)=0.8660 →7 *0.866=6.062 →6.062 *1.976≈12.00 fm.

l=4: sin(26)=0.4384 →9 *0.4384=3.9456 →3.9456 *1.976≈7.80 fm.

Total sum:4.27 +9.30 +12.00 +7.80 =33.37 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sum [ (2l+1) ] × sin(2δ_l) × (1/(k)).

Then,

sum = (4.27 +9.30 +12.00 +7.80) →33.37 →33.37 * (1/0.253) ≈131.86 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option C, 177.675 fm, but I can't find a way to get to that number with the given phase shifts.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing k. Let me recheck.

E =50 MeV.

m = 0.511 MeV.

p = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) / c ≈50 MeV/c.

ħ c =197.33 MeV fm.

k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm /c ) ) =50/(197.33) →≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

1/(2k) =1/(2 *0.253) ≈1.976 fm.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for Im(f(0)) is sum [ (2l+1) ] × sin(δ_l) × (1/(2k)).

Wait, let's compute that.

Each term is (2l+1) sin(δ_l) → multiply by 1.976.

l=0:1 *1 →1.976.

l=1:3 *0.9205=2.7615 →5.46.

l=2:5 *0.8192=4.096 →8.08.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5 →6.916.

l=4:9 *0.22495=2.02455 →4.00.

Sum:1.976 +5.46=7.436 +8.08=15.516 +6.916=22.432 +4.00=26.432 fm.

Not matching.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck and can't find a way to get to any of the options. Perhaps I should look for a different approach, but I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess that the correct answer is option C, 177.675 fm, but I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \), for elastic electron scattering at an energy of \( 50 \, \text{MeV} \), given the phase shifts \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \). The formula for \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \) is derived from the scattering amplitude:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (e^{2i\delta_l} - 1) (2l + 1),
\]

where \( k \) is the wave number of the electrons. The imaginary part is given by:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) \sin(2\delta_l).
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( k \)
The wave number \( k \) is related to the electron's momentum \( p \) by \( k = p / \hbar \). The momentum \( p \) is derived from the relativistic energy-momentum relation:

\[
E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2,
\]

where \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \) is the total energy, \( m c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \) is the electron's rest energy, and \( \hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm} \). Solving for \( p \):

\[
p = \frac{\sqrt{E^2 - (m c^2)^2}}{c} \approx \frac{\sqrt{50^2 - 0.511^2}}{c} \approx \frac{50 \, \text{MeV}}{c}.
\]

Thus, \( k = p / \hbar = \frac{50}{197.33} \, \text{fm}^{-1} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1} \). Consequently:

\[
\frac{1}{2k} \approx \frac{1}{2 \times 0.253} \approx 1.976 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the sum \( \sum (2l + 1) \sin(2\delta_l) \)
For each \( l \), compute \( (2l + 1) \sin(2\delta_l) \), where \( \delta_l \) is in degrees and must be converted to radians for accurate computation:

1. **\( l = 0 \):** \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ \), \( 2\delta_0 = 180^\circ \), \( \sin(180^\circ) = 0 \). Contribution: \( 0 \).
2. **\( l = 1 \):** \( \delta_1 = 67^\circ \), \( 2\delta_1 = 134^\circ \), \( \sin(134^\circ) \approx 0.7193 \). Contribution: \( 3 \times 0.7193 \approx 2.158 \).
3. **\( l = 2 \):** \( \delta_2 = 55^\circ \), \( 2\delta_2 = 110^\circ \), \( \sin(110^\circ) \approx 0.9397 \). Contribution: \( 5 \times 0.9397 \approx 4.6985 \).
4. **\( l = 3 \):** \( \delta_3 = 30^\circ \), \( 2\delta_3 = 60^\circ \), \( \sin(60^\circ) \approx 0.8660 \). Contribution: \( 7 \times 0.8660 \approx 6.062 \).
5. **\( l = 4 \):** \( \delta_4 = 13^\circ \), \( 2\delta_4 = 26^\circ \), \( \sin(26^\circ) \approx 0.4384 \). Contribution: \( 9 \times 0.4384 \approx 3.9456 \).

Summing these contributions:

\[
\sum (2l + 1) \sin(2\delta_l) \approx 0 + 2.158 + 4.6985 + 6.062 + 3.9456 \approx 16.864.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \)
Multiply the sum by \( \frac{1}{2k} \approx 1.976 \, \text{fm} \):

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) \approx 16.864 \times 1.976 \approx 33.323 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with options
The calculated value of \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \approx 33.323 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest plausible answer based on the given options is **C) 177.675 fm**, which is approximately 5 times larger than the computed value. This discrepancy suggests either an error in the problem setup or a misinterpretation of the formula.
