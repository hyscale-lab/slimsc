Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through it again.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows ester group absorption. So, esters usually have strong absorption around 1740 cm^-1, I think. That's a key point.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: six signals. Let me break that down. Two aromatic H signals. Wait, di-substituted aromatic rings can have different substitution patterns. If it's para-substituted, the aromatic protons would be two sets, maybe two doublets each integrating for two Hs. Or if it's ortho, maybe more complex splitting. But the problem says two signals, so maybe para substitution because the aromatic protons are equivalent in two groups.

Then, two vinyl-H signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl groups are like CH2=CH, but wait, if it's a double bond adjacent to something else. Oh, maybe a substituted ethylene group or part of a ring. Wait, but in this case, it's part of an ester perhaps? Or maybe a styrene group. But wait, esters are R-O-CO-O-R, no. Wait, no, the ester functional group is R-O-CO-R. So maybe the aromatic ring has an ester substituent.

Wait, but the di-substituted ring would have two substituents. Let's think: one substituent could be an ester group, and the other substituent perhaps something else. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a vinyl group, but that might not fit with the NMR description.

Wait, the NMR has two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet and another a doublet of quartets. Hmm. Let me think about what that implies. A vinyl group (like CH2=CH-) would have protons that are split based on neighboring groups. For a doublet, maybe each proton is split by one neighboring proton. But wait, in a vinyl group, each CH2 would have two protons, but if it's a CH2 adjacent to a CH, maybe.

Wait, let me think about a structure. Suppose the ring has an ester group and another substituent, maybe a vinyl group attached. Alternatively, maybe the ring has two ester substituents? No, because it's di-substituted, so two substituents. But the problem says the FTIR shows ester groups, so one substituent is an ester. What's the other substituent?

Wait, the NMR also shows two signals for CH3 groups. Each CH3 would likely be a triplet or something, but in this case, two different CH3 signals. So maybe the ester group has two different methyl groups attached.

Wait, the ester functional group is O-CO-O, no, wait. Ester is R-O-CO-R'. So the structure would be something like Ar-O-CO-R, where Ar is the aromatic ring. Wait, no, Ar is di-substituted. Alternatively, Ar could be attached to an ester group as part of the substituent.

Alternatively, maybe the ester is part of another group attached to the ring. Let me think about the possible structures.

Suppose the aromatic ring is substituted with an ester group and another group, perhaps a vinyl group. Wait, but that would account for the vinyl Hs. Alternatively, maybe the ester is part of a side chain.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the NMR signals. Six signals in total.

- Two aromatic H signals: so the ring has two sets of equivalent Hs. For a di-substituted benzene, if it's para-substituted, the aromatic Hs would be two sets, each as doublets. For example, if substituents are at para positions, the ring would have two H environments, each with two Hs (so two doublets in NMR). That fits the two aromatic signals.

- Two vinyl H signals: one doublet, another doublet of quartets. Let's think about a vinyl group next to another group. For example, if you have a structure like CH2=CH-O-CO-..., but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the vinyl group might be part of a substituent attached to the ring.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methylene group attached to an ester. Let me think: the substituent could be O-CO-O-R, but that's not quite right. Maybe a substituent like -O-CO-CH2CH2-O-... Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group attached via an oxygen, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another approach: the substituent could be an ester group, which is an O-CO-O-R group. But wait, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So perhaps the substituent is O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group.

Wait, but the aromatic ring is di-substituted. So perhaps one substituent is O-CO-R, and the other substituent is something else. Alternatively, both substituents are ester groups? No, because di-substituted would have two substituents, but the question says ester group (singular) is present. Oh wait, the FTIR shows presence of ester group, so at least one. But could there be two ester groups? Maybe, but the substituents could be ester and another group.

Wait, the NMR has two CH3 groups. So perhaps the ester group is something like O-CO-OCH2CH3? No, that's an ester but would have more signals. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible structures. We have a di-substituted benzene ring. Each substituent could be an ester group or another group.

Wait, another possibility: the aromatic ring has two substituents. One is an ester group, and the other is a vinyl group attached to something else. But then, the vinyl's protons would be next to other substituents.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group, and the other substituent is a group with a vinyl and CH3 groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a di-substituted benzene ring, with one substituent being an ester group (like O-CO-CH2CH3) and the other substituent being a vinyl group attached to a methyl group or something.

Wait, let's think about the CH3 groups: two signals. Each integrating for 3 H, likely. So two different methyl groups. For example, in an ester like O-CO-OCH2CH3, but that's an ethyl ester, which would have a triplet for the CH2 and quartet for the CH3. Wait, but in the NMR, the signals are for CH3, two of them. So perhaps two different methyl groups attached elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH3)2, but that would have a single CH3 signal, unless there's another methyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group connected to a methyl group. Like CH2=CH-O-CO-... Hmm.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. The compound's formula is one of the options provided: C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

Each option has a different degree of unsaturation. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here.

For C11H12O2: C=11, H=12, O=2. DoU = (2*11 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (24-12)/2 =6. DoU of 6. Could be: one ring (from benzene) is 4 DoU (3 double bonds equivalent?), plus an ester (which has a double bond, so +1), plus maybe a vinyl group (another double bond, +1). Wait, benzene has 3 DoU (each double bond is one DoU, but a ring with three double bonds is three DoU, but benzene actually has three double bonds in a ring, so 4 DoU? No, wait, benzene is one ring plus three double bonds, so DoU is 4 (each double bond is a DoU, and the ring is another). Wait, no, the formula for DoU is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. For benzene: C6H6. DoU is (2*6 +2 -6)/2 = (14-6)/2=4. So benzene contributes four DoU. The ester group (R-O-CO-R') has an ester linkage which is a double bond (so +1 DoU). So if the molecule has a benzene ring (4 DoU), an ester (1 DoU), and possibly a double bond elsewhere (like a vinyl group, another DoU), that would be 6 DoU. So looking at the options:

Option D: C11H12O2: DoU is (2*11 +2 -12)/2 = (24-12)/2=6. So that matches.

Option A: C11H14O2: DoU= (24-14)/2=5. So that's 5 DoU. If benzene is 4, then ester is 1, so that sums to 5, but then where else? Hmm, perhaps no additional double bonds but maybe a ring.

Wait, but if the substituent(s) have a double bond, that would add another DoU. So for option D, 6 DoU would require benzene (4) plus ester (1) plus another double bond (1) elsewhere. That would fit.

So the structure could have a benzene ring, an ester group, and a vinyl group (another double bond). So that would account for the DoU.

Now, looking at the NMR:

- Two aromatic H signals: probably para substitution on the benzene ring, leading to two sets of equivalent Hs. Each set might be a doublet, integrating for two H each.

- Two vinyl H signals: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. That makes me think of a vinyl group adjacent to an oxygen or another group that causes splitting.

Wait, a vinyl group near an electrondonating group might cause coupling. Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is next to an ester group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group and another substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. Or maybe the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-... Hmm, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a group like O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-... No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, let me think about the splitting patterns. One vinyl H is a doublet (so each H is coupled with one other H), and the other is a doublet of quartets (so each H is coupled with two H's each split into quartets). Wait, a quartet is from coupling with a CH2 group. So if the vinyl H is attached to a CH2 group, that might cause a quartet.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the vinyl group is part of a substituent like CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-... But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a methyl ester, but that wouldn't account for the vinyl Hs.

Wait, another thought: the substituent could be an ester group (like O-CO-R) where R is a vinyl group with a methyl substituent. For example, O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-... But I'm stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group connected to an oxygen, like OCH2CH2O, but that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-R. So the substituent is an ester where the R is an aromatic ring, but that seems complicated.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3. So the structure is benzene with two substituents: one is an ester group (O-CO-CH3) and the other is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3?), but that seems a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl ester. For example, CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is benzene with two substituents: one is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ethyl ester) and the other is a vinyl group attached to something else. But that might not explain the NMR.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a styryl group, like CH2=CH- attached to the ring. But that wouldn't explain the ester.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group, and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a CH3.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to draw it out in my mind.

The benzene ring is di-substituted. Let's say one substituent is O-CO-OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Ester would be O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group. So, substituent could be O-CO-CH2CH3.

But then, what's the other substituent? It's a di-substituted ring, so another substituent.

Wait, maybe the other substituent is a vinyl group connected to another methyl group. So, substituent is CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-CH3? No, that's getting too long.

Alternatively, the substituent could be O-CO-CH(CH3)2, but that would have a single CH3 environment, but the NMR has two CH3 signals.

Alternatively, the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH2-O-CH2CH3? No, that seems too complex.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows two CH3 groups. So perhaps the ester group has two different methyl groups attached. Wait, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So R and R' could each be methyl. So O-CO-OCH3 would be a methyl ester. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the ester would be R-O-CO-R' where R and R' are different.

Wait, maybe the ester is something like CH3-O-CO-CH2CH3. Then, the substituent on the benzene would be O-CO-CH2CH3, but that would give a CH2CH3 group. But in the NMR, the CH3 groups would appear as a triplet for the CH2 and a triplet for the other CH3? Hmm, but the NMR shows two CH3 signals. So perhaps the ester substituent is CH3-O-CO-CH2CH2- something?

No, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached to the ester. Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH3)2. But then, the CH(CH3)2 would have two CH3 groups, but they are equivalent, so only one signal. But the NMR shows two CH3 signals, so they must be non-equivalent.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester?), but that would have a CH2CH2CH3 group, which would have more signals than just two CH3.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is an ester where R and R' are different methyl groups. For example, R-O-CO-R' where R is methyl and R' is another group with a CH3. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH2-O-R, but that doesn't directly involve CH3 groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. So the substituent would be CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-R. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, considering the vinyl Hs: one is a doublet, another a doublet of quartets. Let's think about how that would happen. The doublet might come from a vinyl proton that's next to another vinyl proton (coupling with one neighbor). The doublet of quartets could be from a proton that's next to two groups, each providing splitting. For example, if a proton is next to a CH2 group and a double bond, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps it's a structure like CH2=CH-O-CO-R attached to the benzene. Then the vinyl protons would be split by adjacent groups. For example, the H on CH2 would be next to the CH-O, and the H on CH-O would be next to the CH2 and any other substituents.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the possible splitting.

If the structure is CH2=CH-O-CO-R attached to the benzene ring, then the protons on the CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH. So each would be a doublet. Wait, but the NMR shows one doublet and another as a doublet of quartets.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 is next to an oxygen, and the protons on the CH2 are split by the oxygen's neighboring groups. Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to an electrondonating group, causing a triplet or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that the vinyl group is part of a substituent that has branching, like CH2=CH-CH(CH3)2 or something similar.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to count the number of protons each signal represents.

In the NMR, we have:

- Two aromatic H signals: let's say each integrates to 2 H, since a di-substituted benzene with para substituents would have two sets of two H each. So that's 4 H accounted for.

- Two vinyl H signals: perhaps each integrating to 2 H, but the problem says 'two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)'. Wait, no, the problem says two signals: one is a doublet, another a doublet of quartets. So each signal could be integrating to 1 H or 2 H.

Wait, a vinyl group typically has two H (as in CH2=CH). So perhaps each of these two signals corresponds to two H each. So that's 4 H.

Then, two signals for CH3 groups: each integrating to 3 H, so 6 H.

Wait, but the aromatic ring has 6 H normally. If the ring is di-substituted (two substituents), then the aromatic H would be 4 H (because two substituents take the place of two H each, but depending on substitution pattern). Wait, no. Benzene has six H. For a para-disubstituted benzene, the substituents are opposite each other, so each substituent replaces one H. So the remaining H are two sets of two each. So that's four H on the ring. So the first two signals (aromatic) account for four H.

Then, the vinyl H signals: two signals, each integrating to 2 H. So that's four more H.

The CH3 signals: two signals, each 3 H. So 6 H.

Total H so far: 4 (aromatic) +4 (vinyl) +6 (CH3) =14 H.

Wait, but the options for H are 12, 14, etc. So if the formula has 14 H, that would match option A (C11H14O2) or B (C12H14O2).

Wait, but let's check the options:

Option A: C11H14O2 → H=14

Option B: C12H14O2 → H=14

Option C: C12H12O2 → H=12

Option D: C11H12O2 → H=12

So if the total H is 14, then the formula must be either A or B.

But wait, the aromatic ring has six H normally, but substituents replace some. For a di-substituted benzene, if it's para, two substituents each replace one H, so 6-2=4 H left, which matches our earlier count. So the substituents account for 2 H each (since each substituent replaces one H).

Wait, no. Each substituent replaces one H, so two substituents replace two H, leaving four aromatic H.

So the aromatic H are four. The vinyl H are four (two signals each integrating to two H). The CH3 groups are six H. That sums to 14 H. So the formula must be either A or B.

Now, what about the number of carbons?

The options are:

A) C11H14O2 → 11 C

B) C12H14O2 →12 C

The benzene ring has six C. The substituents add more C.

Each substituent: let's say one substituent is an ester group, which is O-CO-R. R is an alkyl group.

If the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (ethyl propyl ester?), that would add more C.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ethyl ester), which would add two C from the ethyl group. So substituent is O-CO-CH2CH3: that's 3 C (O, C, O, but wait, the substituent is attached to the ring as O-CO-CH2CH3. So the substituent contributes 3 C (the O-CO- part is part of the substituent, but the R is CH2CH3, which is two C.

Wait, the substituent is O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group. Let's say R is CH2CH3 (ethyl). So the substituent would contribute 3 C (O, C, O, and R has two C). Wait, perhaps the substituent adds three C: the O is part of the ring, the carbonyl C, and the R group.

Wait, perhaps each substituent adds three C: O-CO-CH2CH3 would add 3 (the COO part plus the CH2CH3? Or maybe O-CO-R is two C (COO and R).

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-R, where R is a methyl group. Then substituent adds two C (COO and R).

But in any case, the total C would be 6 (ring) + substituents.

Since the compound is di-substituted, each substituent adds some C.

Let's say substituent 1 is O-CO-R (ester), which contributes (number of C in R + 2: COO. Wait, O-CO-R: the substituent has O-CO-R, which is 2 C (the COO part is one C, but R has its own C).

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ethyl ester). That would contribute three C: O-CO-O-CH2CH3. No, wait: the substituent is O-CO-R, so R is CH2CH3. So substituent contributes (COO- is two C, plus R is two C). So substituent 1: 4 C? No, because O-CO-R would be two C (the COO part) plus R's C. Let's see: R is CH2CH3 has two C. So substituent is O-CO-CH2CH3, which has 3 C (O, C, O, and the two CH2CH3 C's? Wait, no. Let me count: the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH3. So the O is attached to the benzene, then a C=O, then an O connected to CH2CH3. So the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2CH3? No, that would be incorrect. Wait, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So substituent would be O-CO-R', where R' is CH2CH3.

So substituent on benzene is O-CO-CH2CH3. That substituent has three C: the O is part of the ring, then COO (one C), and the R' is two C (CH2CH3). So substituent adds (1 C from COO and 2 C from R'), but wait, the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH3, which is three C (the O-CO- is two C, and the CH2CH3 is two C? No, wait, the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH3. So the substituent has three C: O (attached to the ring), C (from COO), and then the CH2CH3 has two C. So that's three C in the substituent. So substituent 1 adds three C.

Substituent 2: perhaps a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, like CH2=CH-CH2-... Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, substituent 2 could be a CH2CH3 group, but that would have a triplet in NMR, but the problem states no CH2 signals, only CH3.

Wait, the NMR has no signals corresponding to CH2 groups. So any CH2 groups would have to be equivalent and perhaps not show up, but that's unlikely. Or perhaps the CH2 groups are in a symmetrical environment and their peaks are overlapping or not observed. But that's less likely.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent doesn't have any CH2 groups.

Wait, substituent 2 could be a methyl group attached via an oxygen, like OCH3. Then, substituent 2 is OCH3, which contributes one C. So substituent 2 is OCH3.

Wait, but that would make the total substituent C: substituent 1 (3 C) + substituent 2 (1 C) → 4 C. Benzene is 6 C. So total C: 6 +4 =10. But the options have 11 or 12 C.

Hmm, not matching. So perhaps substituent 2 is a larger group.

Wait, substituent 2 could be a vinyl group connected to a methyl group, like CH2=CH-CH2-... But that would have CH2 groups, which would show up as signals in the NMR, but the problem states no CH2 signals. So perhaps substituent 2 is a group without any CH2.

Wait, substituent 2 could be a CH3 group attached via an oxygen, like OCH3. Then substituent 2 contributes one C.

So substituent 1: O-CO-CH2CH3 → 3 C (COO- is 2 C, but wait, no. O-CO-CH2CH3: the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH3, which has three C (the COO is one C, and the CH2CH3 is two C). So substituent 1 contributes three C.

Substituent 2: OCH3 → contributes one C.

So total C: 6 (ring) +3 +1 =10. But the options have 11 or 12.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 2 is a larger group. Let's say substituent 2 is a CH2=CH group attached to something else. But that would require more C.

Alternatively, substituent 2 could be a CH2 group attached to another substituent. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, making the substituent CH2=CH-CH3. So substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3. That substituent has three C (CH2, CH, CH3). So substituent 2 contributes three C.

Substituent 1: O-CO-CH2CH3 → three C.

So total substituent C: 3 +3 =6.

Ring:6 → total C:6+6=12. That fits option B (C12H14O2) or C (C12H12O2).

Wait, substituent 1: O-CO-CH2CH3 → that's three C (COO is two C, and CH2CH3 is two C. Wait, no: O-CO-CH2CH3 is substituent, which is O-CO-R where R is CH2CH3. So COO is one C (the carbonyl), and R has two C. So substituent 1 has 1 (COO) +2 (R) = three C.

Substituent 2: CH2=CH-CH3 → three C (CH2, CH, CH3).

Wait, but benzene has six C. So 6 +3 +3 =12 C. That fits option B (C12H14O2) or option C (C12H12O2).

Now, what about the H count:

Substituent 1: O-CO-CH2CH3 → CH2CH3 has five H (but wait, no. CH2CH3 has two CH2 groups. Wait, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3. So the CH2CH3 group has 2 +3 =5 H? Or wait, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3. So the ethyl group would have two CH2 groups? No, ethyl is CH2CH3. So substituent 1 brings in 2 (from CH2) +3 (from CH3)=5 H.

Wait, but the NMR has two CH3 signals, each integrating to 3 H. So substituent 1 has a CH2CH3 group, which would have a triplet for the CH2 and a triplet for the CH3. But the NMR shows two CH3 signals, which would account for the CH3 from the CH2CH3 group and another CH3 from substituent 2.

Wait, substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3. So that's a propenyl group. The CH3 at the end would be a triplet or something else.

Wait, but substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3. The CH2=CH- group would have two H (each as a doublet), and the CH3 would be a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2.

But in the NMR, we have two CH3 signals. So substituent 1's CH3 (from CH2CH3) and substituent 2's CH3 (from CH2=CH-CH3) would give two CH3 signals.

So substituent 1: O-CO-CH2CH3 → brings in 2 H (CH2) and 3 H (CH3).

Substituent 2: CH2=CH-CH3 → brings in 2 H (CH2=CH) and 3 H (CH3).

So substituent 1 contributes 5 H (2+3), substituent 2 contributes 5 H (2+3). But in the NMR, the vinyl H signals are two signals, each integrating to 2 H. That would be 4 H from substituent 2. And the CH3 signals are two, each integrating to 3 H → 6 H.

Wait, substituent 1's CH2CH3 would have 2 H (CH2) and 3 H (CH3). But the CH2 would be split into a quartet or something, but the problem states no CH2 signals. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1's CH2CH3 is a symmetric group, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH(CH3)2. Then, substituent 1 has a single CH3 group (since both are equivalent). But the NMR requires two CH3 signals. So that can't be the case.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester). That would bring in a CH2CH2CH3 group. The CH2CH2CH3 would have two CH2 groups, which would produce CH2 signals, but the problem says there are none. So that's not possible.

Hmm, maybe substituent 1 isn't an ethyl ester but a methyl ester. So substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3. That's a methyl ester. So substituent 1 contributes two C (COO and CH3). So substituent 1 brings in two C.

Substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)2. No, that's getting too complicated and would have more CH3 signals.

Wait, let's try substituent 1 as O-CO-CH3 (methyl ester), which brings in 2 C (COO and CH3). Substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-CH3. No, that seems too long.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, like CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3. Then, substituent 2 would have a CH2=CH-O- group. The substituent 2 would contribute CH2=CH-O- which brings in a double bond (another DoU) and a CH3 from the ester.

But let me count the H for substituent 2: CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3. The CH2=CH would have 2 H (each as a doublet), and the O-CO-CH3 would have 3 H as a singlet. So substituent 2 brings in 2+3=5 H.

Substituent 1: O-CO-CH3 → brings in 3 H (the CH3) and the COO is just C and O.

So substituent 1 contributes 3 H (from CH3), substituent 2 contributes 5 H (2 from CH2=CH and 3 from O-CO-CH3). But that's 8 H from substituents.

The aromatic H is 4.

So total H:4 (aromatic) +8 (substituents) =12 H.

But earlier analysis suggested that the H count would be 14, but this scenario only adds up to 12. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a larger group. Let me see. Another approach: perhaps the compound is methyl vinyl ether acetate or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-CH2CH3. But that would bring in more H.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-CH2CH3. Then substituent 2 would have CH2=CH-O- and a CH2CH3 group.

But this is getting too complicated, and I'm not making progress. Let's try to summarize what I have so far.

We have a di-substituted benzene ring:

- One substituent is an ester group (O-CO-R), which contributes to the DoU and brings in R's structure.

- The other substituent brings in the vinyl H and CH3 groups.

The NMR shows:

- 4 aromatic H (two signals, each 2 H).

- 4 vinyl H (two signals, each 2 H).

- 6 CH3 H (two signals, each 3 H).

Total H=14. So the formula must have 14 H. That points to options A (C11H14O2) or B (C12H14O2).

Now, how many C?

Benzene:6 C.

Substituent 1 (ester): O-CO-R. Suppose R is CH2CH3 (ethyl). So substituent 1 brings in 3 C (COO and CH2CH3).

Substituent 2: let's say it's CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-..., but that's getting too long. Alternatively, substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3, which brings in 3 C.

Total substituent C:3 (ester) +3 (vinyl CH2CH3?) →6 C.

Total C:6 (benzene) +6 =12 C. So formula is C12H14O2 → option B.

Wait, but substituent 2 being CH2=CH-CH3 would add three C. Substituent 1 (ester) adds three C. So total substituent C is six. Plus benzene's six, making twelve C. So the formula would be C12H14O2.

So the answer would be option B: C12H14O2.

The problem involves identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group, which typically absorbs around 1740 cm⁻¹. The 1H NMR spectrum provides the following information:

1. **Two aromatic-H signals**: This suggests a para-substitution pattern on the benzene ring, leaving two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, each integrating to 2 H.

2. **Two vinyl-H signals**: One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. This indicates the presence of a vinyl group (CH₂=CH) adjacent to other substituents, causing the observed splitting patterns.

3. **Two –CH₃ signals**: Each integrates to 3 H, indicating two distinct methyl groups in the structure.

4. **No –CH₂ signals**: This implies that any methylene groups in the structure are either equivalent or not observed.

### Key Analysis:
- **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**  
  The compound must account for the aromatic ring (4 DoU), the ester group (1 DoU), and the vinyl group (1 DoU), totaling 6 DoU. This matches the molecular formulas provided in the options.

- **Hydrogen Count:**  
  The total number of hydrogens is 14, as calculated from the NMR signals:
  - Aromatic-H: 4 H (2 signals, each integrating to 2 H).
  - Vinyl-H: 4 H (2 signals, each integrating to 2 H).
  - –CH₃ groups: 6 H (2 signals, each integrating to 3 H).

- **Carbon Count:**  
  The benzene ring contributes 6 carbons. The ester group (O-CO-R) and the vinyl group (CH₂=CH) add the remaining carbons. For the formula **C₁₂H₁₄O₂**, the substituents account for 6 carbons (3 from the ester group and 3 from the vinyl group).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **C₁₁H₁₂O₂ (Option D):**  
  This formula has only 12 hydrogens, which is inconsistent with the NMR data (14 hydrogens total).

- **C₁₁H₁₄O₂ (Option A):**  
  This formula has 14 hydrogens but only 11 carbons, which is insufficient to account for the benzene ring (6 carbons), the ester group, and the vinyl group.

- **C₁₂H₁₂O₂ (Option C):**  
  This formula has only 12 hydrogens, which is inconsistent with the NMR data (14 hydrogens total).

- **C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (Option B):**  
  This formula has 14 hydrogens and 12 carbons, which is consistent with the benzene ring (6 carbons), the ester group (3 carbons), and the vinyl group (3 carbons).

### Conclusion:
The chemical formula that matches the given spectral data and the structural analysis is **C₁₂H₁₄O₂**.
