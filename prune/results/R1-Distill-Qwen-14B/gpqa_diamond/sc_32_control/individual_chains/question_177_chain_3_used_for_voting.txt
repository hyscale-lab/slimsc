Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The question gives some parameters, and I need to calculate how much more luminous Star_1 is compared to Star_2.

Alright, let's break down the information given. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So, R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So M1 = 1.5 * M2. Interesting, same factor for both radius and mass. But wait, the question is about luminosity, so I don't think the mass directly comes into play here unless it's related to other factors like temperature or something else.

The next part says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, then T1 = T2. That makes sense.

The radial velocities are given: Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity is the component of the star's velocity along the observer's line of sight. A radial velocity of zero would mean that, from our perspective, Star_1 isn't moving towards or away from us. So no Doppler shift there. But Star_2 is moving away (or towards) at 700 km/s. But wait, the problem is about their intrinsic brightness, their luminosity, not their observed brightness (apparent brightness). Radial velocity affects the observed wavelengths due to Doppler effect, but since the question is about the stars' actual temperatures and thus luminosity, maybe the radial velocity doesn't directly affect the calculation? Hmm, maybe I should think more about this.

Wait, but the problem mentions that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. Since they used spectroscopy, which measures the observed wavelengths, the radial velocity would affect the observed λ_max. But the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is same for both. But wait, wait. Because of their different velocities, the intrinsic λ_max (from their temperatures) would be different, but when observed, because of Doppler shift, they appear at the same λ_max. Oh, that's probably important.

Wait, let me think again. So for each star, the observed λ_max (what the astronomer measures) is the same. Let's call this observed λ_observed. Now, the intrinsic λ_max for each star (λ_rest) depends on their temperatures. So, λ_observed is related to λ_rest via the Doppler effect formula.

The Doppler shift formula for light is λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ), assuming v_r is much smaller than the speed of light. Wait, but 700 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light. The speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, so 700 is about 0.0023 of c, which is small but not negligible for precise calculations. So the relativistic Doppler effect might be needed. Alternatively, perhaps a non-relativistic approximation would be sufficient. Hmm. Let me think about the Doppler formula.

In non-relativistic terms, the Doppler shift is approximately λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c ), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, if the star is moving away, v_r is positive, so the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). Conversely, if a star is moving towards us, the wavelength would be shorter (blueshifted). But in this problem, Star_1 has v_r = 0, so λ_observed1 = λ_rest1. Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away, so the observed λ_observed2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + 700/(c)). Wait, but Star_1's observed λ is λ_rest1, and Star_2's observed λ is λ_rest2*(1+700/c). But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same, so λ_observed1 = λ_observed2.

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + 700/c )

Wait, that's the equation. But λ_rest is related to temperature via Wien's law: λ_rest = b / T. So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + 700/c )

Simplify: T1 = T2 / (1 + 700/c )

Wait, that's because when you rearrange the equation,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + 700/c )

So, T1 = T2 / (1 + 700/c )

But 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s. The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So 700,000 m/s divided by 3e8 m/s is about 0.002333. So 1 + (700,000 / 3e8) is approximately 1.002333.

So,

T1 ≈ T2 / 1.002333 ≈ T2 * (1 - 0.002333) approximately, using the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x for small x.

But wait, 1/(1.002333) is approximately 0.997668. So T1 ≈ 0.997668 * T2.

So the temperature of Star_1 is about 0.997668 times that of Star_2.

Wait, but the problem states that the observed wavelengths at which they appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is same for both. But their rest wavelengths are different, so their temperatures must be different. Therefore, T1 and T2 are not the same. That's a bit confusing because earlier I thought that if λ_max is the same, T must be same, but that's in their rest frames. But since they have different velocities, their observed λ_max can be same even if rest λ_max is different.

So, in this problem, the observed λ_max is same. So each star's λ_rest is Doppler shifted into the same observed λ_max. So the two stars have different intrinsic temperatures.

Therefore, I need to calculate T1 and T2 based on their Doppler shifts.

Wait, perhaps I should write the exact Doppler formula. Since the velocities are significant, maybe the relativistic formula is better.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula is λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ), where v is the radial velocity. But wait, v is positive if moving away, negative if moving towards. So for Star_2, if it's moving away, v is positive. For Star_1, v is zero.

So,

For Star_1:
λ_observed1 = λ_rest1 * sqrt( (1 + 0)/(1 - 0) ) = λ_rest1.

For Star_2:
λ_observed2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Since λ_observed1 = λ_observed2,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Which can be rearranged to:

λ_rest1 / λ_rest2 = sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But λ_rest = b / T, so:

( b / T1 ) / ( b / T2 ) ) = sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Simplify:

T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

So,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

Hmm. Let's compute this with v2 being 700 km/s. Let me compute the value.

First, v2 = 700,000 m/s. c is 3e8 m/s.

v2/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

So,

(1 - v2/c) = 1 - 0.023333 ≈ 0.976667.

(1 + v2/c) = 1 + 0.023333 ≈ 1.023333.

So,

(1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) = (0.976667)/(1.023333) ≈ let's compute it.

0.976667 / 1.023333 ≈ 0.9547.

Taking the square root: sqrt(0.9547) ≈ 0.977.

So,

T1 ≈ T2 * 0.977.

Wait, so T1 is about 0.977 times T2.

Now, the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T^4.

So, the luminosity depends on the radius squared and the temperature to the fourth power.

Star_1's luminosity (L1) is:

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4

Similarly, L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4

The ratio L1/L2 is:

(R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4 )

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.

So,

(R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T1 is 0.977 T2, so T1/T2 = 0.977.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.977)^4.

Let me compute (0.977)^4.

0.977 squared is approximately 0.977 * 0.977.

0.977 * 0.977:

Let me compute 0.97^2 = 0.9409, 0.977^2 is a bit more.

0.977 * 0.977:

= (0.97 + 0.007)^2 = 0.97² + 2 * 0.97 * 0.007 + (0.007)^2

= 0.9409 + 0.01358 + 0.000049 ≈ 0.9409 + 0.01358 = 0.95448 + 0.000049 ≈ 0.9545.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 0.977 is larger than 0.97, so 0.977^2 should be a bit larger than 0.9409.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 0.977 * 0.977 in a more accurate way.

0.977 * 0.977:

Compute as (977)^2, then divide by 1e6.

977 * 977.

Let me compute 977 * 977:

Compute 977 * 900 = 879,300.

977 * 70 = 68,390.

977 *7 = 6,839.

Wait, wait, actually, 977 * 977:

It's easier to note that (1000 -23)^2 = 1000² - 2*1000*23 + 23² = 1,000,000 -46,000 + 529 = 954,529.

So 977^2 = 954529.

So 0.977^2 = 954529e-6 ≈ 0.954529.

So, 0.977^2 ≈ 0.9545.

Then, 0.977^4 is (0.9545)^2.

Compute 0.9545^2.

Again, (954.5)^2 = let's compute 954.5 * 954.5.

But perhaps compute 0.95^2 = 0.9025.

Wait, 0.9545 ≈ 0.95 + 0.0045.

So (0.95 + 0.0045)^2 = 0.95² + 2*0.95*0.0045 + (0.0045)^2.

= 0.9025 + 0.00855 + 0.00002025 ≈ 0.9025 + 0.00855 = 0.91105 + 0.00002025 ≈ 0.91107.

So approximately 0.911.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.911.

Putting it all together:

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (0.911) ≈ 2.25 * 0.911.

Let me compute that.

2.25 * 0.9 = 2.025.

2.25 * 0.011 = 0.02475.

Total ≈ 2.025 + 0.02475 = 2.04975.

Wait, that's approximately 2.05. But wait, that's not matching any of the options given. The options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

Hmm, that's a problem. My calculation is leading me to about 2.05, but the options are higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my approach. Let me go back.

Wait, in the Doppler effect, I assumed that Star_2 is moving away. But if Star_2 is moving towards us, the Doppler shift would be blueshift. But the observed λ_max would be shorter. However, in the problem, the observed λ_max are the same. So, if Star_1 is not moving (v_r=0), and Star_2 has v_r=700 km/s, which direction is it moving? If Star_2 is moving towards us, the observed λ_max would be smaller, but if they both have the same observed λ_max, then Star_1 must have a higher temperature, perhaps.

Wait, let me think again. So, Star_1's observed λ_max is λ_rest1, and Star_2's observed λ_max is λ_rest2 * (sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )).

If Star_2 is moving towards us, v is negative because it's moving towards us. So v = -700 km/s.

So, let's try that.

v2 = -700,000 m/s.

So,

(1 + v2/c) = 1 + (-700e3)/(3e8) = 1 - 0.002333 ≈ 0.997667.

(1 - v2/c) = 1 - (-700e3/3e8) = 1 + 0.002333 ≈ 1.002333.

So, (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) = 0.997667/1.002333 ≈ 0.99537.

So the sqrt of that is sqrt(0.99537) ≈ 0.99768.

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * 0.99768.

But λ_rest = b / T, so:

(b / T1) = (b / T2) * 0.99768.

Simplify: T1 = T2 / 0.99768 ≈ T2 * 1.00233.

Hmm, that would mean T1 is about 1.00233 times T2. So, higher temperature than Star_2.

Wait, now that makes sense. Because if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ_max is blueshifted, so shorter than its rest λ_max, so λ_observed2 = λ_rest2 * 0.99768.

But since λ_observed1 = λ_observed2, then λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * 0.99768.

Which implies that T1 = T2 / 0.99768 ≈ T2 * 1.00233.

So, T1 is a bit higher than T2.

Ah, so I think I made a mistake in the direction of the velocity. So the previous calculation was wrong because I assumed Star_2 was moving away, but perhaps it's moving towards us.

So, with T1 = 1.00233 * T2.

Now let's recalculate the luminosity ratio.

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4)/(R2² T2^4) = ( (1.5 R2)^2 / R2^2 ) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= (2.25) * ( (1.00233)^4 )

Compute (1.00233)^4.

Let me compute 1.00233 squared first.

1.00233^2 ≈ 1.00466.

Then, square that: (1.00466)^2 ≈ 1.00933.

Wait, more accurately:

1.00233^2 = 1 + 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 1.00466 + 0.00000543 ≈ 1.004665.

Then,

(1.004665)^2 = (approx) 1.004665 * 1.004665.

Compute this:

= 1 * 1 = 1

1 * 0.004665 = 0.004665

0.004665 * 1 = 0.004665

0.004665 * 0.004665 ≈ ~0.0000217.

Sum all terms:

1 + 0.004665 + 0.004665 + 0.0000217 ≈ 1 + (0.00933) + 0.0000217 ≈ 1.00935.

So, (1.00233)^4 ≈ 1.00935.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00935 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00935.

Calculating that:

2.25 * 1 = 2.25.

2.25 * 0.00935 ≈ 0.0210375.

Total is approximately 2.25 + 0.0210375 = 2.2710375.

So, about 2.27 times.

Looking at the options, none exactly match that. Wait, option B is ~2.32, C is ~2.35, D is ~2.23, A is ~2.25.

Hmm, 2.27 is close to 2.25 and 2.23. Let me see if I can be more precise in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate (1.00233)^4 more accurately.

Compute 1.00233^4:

First, compute 1.00233^2: let's use a calculator approach.

1.00233 * 1.00233.

= 1 + 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2.

= 1 + 0.00466 + 0.00000543.

= 1.00466543.

Now, square that: (1.00466543)^2.

= (1 + 0.00466543)^2.

= 1^2 + 2 * 1 * 0.00466543 + (0.00466543)^2.

= 1 + 0.00933086 + (approx) 0.00002176.

So, 1 + 0.00933086 = 1.00933086 + 0.00002176 ≈ 1.00935262.

So, (1.00233)^4 ≈ 1.00935262.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00935262 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00935262.

Compute 2.25 * 1.00935262.

2.25 * 1 = 2.25.

2.25 * 0.00935262 = 0.021037.

So, total is approximately 2.25 + 0.021037 = 2.271037.

So about 2.271.

Hmm, none of the options exactly match that. But let's look at the options again.

Options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Doppler shift. Maybe I should use more precise numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact ratio without any approximations.

Let me recompute T1 and T2 more accurately.

Given that λ_observed1 = λ_observed2.

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Wait, but v2 is the radial velocity of Star_2. If Star_2 is moving towards us, v2 is negative.

So, v2 = -700,000 m/s.

So,

(1 + v2/c) = 1 + (-700e3)/(3e8) = 1 - 700e3/(3e8) = 1 - (7e5)/(3e8) = 1 - 7/(300) = (300-7)/300 = 293/300 ≈ 0.9766667.

(1 - v2/c) = 1 - (-7e5/3e8) = 1 + (7e5/3e8) = 1 + 7/(300) = 307/300 ≈ 1.0233333.

So,

(1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) = (293/300) / (307/300) )= 293/307 ≈ 0.9544.

Then, the square root of this is sqrt(293/307) = sqrt(0.9544).

Compute sqrt(0.9544):

Let me see, 0.977^2 = 0.9545, as earlier. So sqrt(0.9544) ≈ 0.977, as before.

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * 0.977.

Which implies:

λ_rest1/λ_rest2 = 0.977.

Since λ_rest = b/T, (λ_rest1)/(λ_rest2) = (T2)/(T1) = 0.977.

So,

T1 = T2 / 0.977 ≈ T2 * 1.0235.

Wait, wait, because T1 = T2 / (λ_rest1/λ_rest2) )= T2/(0.977) ≈ 1.0235 T2.

Wait, that's a better approach. Because (λ_rest1)/(λ_rest2) = (b/T1)/(b/T2) )= T2/(T1) = 0.977.

So, T2 = 0.977 T1 → T1 = T2 / 0.977 ≈ T2 * 1.0235. So, T1 is about 2.35% higher than T2.

Hmm, that changes things. Earlier, I thought T1 was higher, but perhaps I switched the ratio.

Wait, let me make sure.

We have λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 -v/c) )

But with v = -700e3 m/s, so (1 + v/c) = (1 - 700e3/(3e8)) = 293/300 ≈ 0.9766667.

(1 - v/c) = 1 + (700e3/(3e8)) = 307/300 ≈ 1.023333.

So,

sqrt( (293/300)/(307/300) ) ) = sqrt(293/307) ) ≈ 0.977.

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * 0.977.

Which implies that λ_rest1 is shorter than λ_rest2. Since shorter wavelengths imply higher temperatures (since λ_rest is inversely proportional to T), that means T1 is higher than T2.

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * factor → factor is 0.977. So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * 0.977 → 1/T1 = 0.977 / T2 → T1 = T2 / 0.977 ≈ 1.0235 * T2.

So, T1 ≈ 1.0235 T2.

So, now, the luminosity ratio is:

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4)/(R2² T2^4 )

= ( (1.5 R2)^2 / R2^2 ) * ( (1.0235 T2 )^4 / T2^4 )

= 2.25 * (1.0235)^4.

Compute (1.0235)^4.

Compute (1.0235)^2 first:

1.0235^2 = 1.0235 * 1.0235.

Let me compute it:

1.0235 * 1.0235.

= (1 + 0.0235)^2 = 1 + 2*0.0235 + (0.0235)^2.

= 1 + 0.047 + 0.00055225 ≈ 1.04755225.

Then, square that result:

(1.04755225)^2.

= (1 + 0.04755225)^2.

= 1^2 + 2*(1)*0.04755225 + (0.04755225)^2.

= 1 + 0.0951045 + 0.0022612.

= 1.0973657.

So, (1.0235)^4 ≈ 1.0973657.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.0973657 ≈ 2.25 * 1.0973657.

Let's compute that:

2 * 1.0973657 = 2.1947314.

0.25 * 1.0973657 = 0.2743414.

Total is 2.1947314 + 0.2743414 = 2.4690728.

Wait, that's about 2.469.

Hmm, but that's higher than any of the options. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (1.0235)^4.

Wait, let me compute 1.0235^4 more accurately.

Wait, 1.0235^2 = (1.0235 * 1.0235). Let's compute step by step.

1.0235 * 1.0235:

1 * 1 = 1.

1 * 0.0235 = 0.0235.

0.0235 * 1 = 0.0235.

0.0235 * 0.0235 = 0.00055225.

Adding them up:

1 + 0.0235 + 0.0235 + 0.00055225 = 1 + 0.047 + 0.00055225 = 1.04755225.

So that's correct.

Now, 1.04755225^2.

Compute 1.04755225 * 1.04755225.

We can write this as (1 + 0.04755225)^2.

= 1 + 2*0.04755225 + (0.04755225)^2.

= 1 + 0.0951045 + 0.0022612.

= 1.0973657.

So, that's correct.

So, (1.0235)^4 is indeed approximately 1.0973657.

So, 2.25 * 1.0973657 ≈ 2.469.

Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should use the exact Doppler shift formula without any approximations.

Because earlier, I assumed that v is small compared to c, but 700 km/s is about 0.23% of c, which is small but not negligible if it's leading to a big discrepancy in the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler effect and assume that the stars have the same temperature because their observed λ_max is the same. But that can't be right, because if they have the same observed λ_max, but different velocities, their temperatures are different.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, the observed λ_max is same. So their temperatures are different, and the Doppler effect must be considered.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact expression without any approximation. Let's try that.

Given that λ_observed is same for both stars.

For Star_1: λ1_obs = λ1_rest * sqrt( (1 + v1/c)/(1 - v1/c) )

But v1 is 0, so λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

For Star_2: λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Given λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But λ1_rest = b / T1, and λ2_rest = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Cancel b on both sides:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

So,

T1 = T2 / sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

= T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

But v2 is 700 km/s, which is 7e5 m/s.

So,

v2/c = (7e5)/(3e8) = 7/(300) ≈ 0.0233333.

So,

(1 - v2/c) = 1 - 0.0233333 = 0.9766667.

(1 + v2/c) = 1 + 0.0233333 = 1.0233333.

So,

(1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) = 0.9766667 / 1.0233333 ≈ 0.9544.

Taking the square root gives sqrt(0.9544) ≈ 0.977.

So,

T1 = T2 * 0.977.

Wait, that's different from before. Wait, earlier I thought T1 was higher because I considered the direction, but according to this, T1 = T2 * 0.977, implying T1 is lower than T2.

But that can't be, because if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ_max should be blueshifted, so λ_observed is less than λ_rest. But the problem states that both have the same observed λ_max.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think: Star_1 has v_r=0, so λ_obs1 = λ_rest1. Star_2 has v_r=700, so λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * Doppler factor.

If Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ is less than λ_rest2, so λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), but with v negative, since it's moving towards us.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should correct the formula.

The Doppler shift formula when moving towards the observer (v is positive towards us) is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Because when approaching, the wavelength is blueshifted, so λ_obs < λ_rest.

Wait, let me clarify.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula when the source is moving towards the observer at speed v is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So, for Star_2, which has v_r = 700 km/s (assuming it's moving towards us, so v is positive), λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

And since λ_obs1 = λ_rest1, because v_r=0.

Given that λ_obs1 = λ_obs2,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So,

λ_rest1 / λ_rest2 = sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Which equals sqrt( (1 - 0.023333)/(1 + 0.023333) ) = sqrt(0.976667/1.023333) ≈ sqrt(0.9544) ≈ 0.977.

So,

(λ_rest1)/(λ_rest2) = 0.977.

But λ_rest = b / T, so (T2)/(T1) = 0.977 → T1 = T2 / 0.977 ≈ 1.0235 T2.

Ah, so correct approach gives T1 = 1.0235 T2.

So, the earlier approach was correct, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

So, with T1 = 1.0235 T2.

Now, the L1/L2 ratio:

L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4 )/( R2^2 T2^4 ) ) = ( (1.5 R2)^2 / R2^2 ) * ( (1.0235 T2 )^4 / T2^4 )

= (2.25) * (1.0235)^4.

Earlier, I computed (1.0235)^4 as approximately 1.0973657.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.0973657 ≈ 2.25 * 1.0973657.

Let me compute 2.25 * 1.0973657.

Breaking it down:

2 * 1.0973657 = 2.1947314.

0.25 * 1.0973657 = 0.2743414.

Adding together: 2.1947314 + 0.2743414 = 2.4690728.

So, approximately 2.469.

But that's not matching any of the options, which are all lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (1.0235)^4. Let me recompute that.

Compute (1.0235)^4.

First, compute (1.0235)^2.

1.0235 * 1.0235:

= (1 + 0.0235)^2 = 1 + 2*0.0235 + (0.0235)^2.

= 1 + 0.047 + 0.00055225 = 1.04755225.

Then, (1.04755225)^2.

= (1.04755225) * (1.04755225)

Compute 1.04755225 * 1.04755225:

Let me compute it step by step.

1 * 1 = 1.

1 * 0.04755225 = 0.04755225.

0.04755225 * 1 = 0.04755225.

0.04755225 * 0.04755225 ≈ 0.0022612.

Now, sum all terms.

1 + 0.04755225 + 0.04755225 + 0.0022612 ≈ 1 + (0.0951045) + 0.0022612 ≈ 1.0973657.

So, correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler effect is being considered in the wrong direction.

Wait, if Star_2 is moving away, then v is positive, and the observed λ would be redshifted.

So, let's try that.

v_r = +700 km/s (moving away).

Then, λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which would be longer than λ_rest2.

So, in this case, since λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 and λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt(1.023333/0.9766667) = λ_rest2 * sqrt(1.047).

Wait, sqrt(1.047) ≈ 1.023.

So,

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * 1.023.

But λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

So, λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 → λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * 1.023.

Which implies,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * 1.023 → T1 = T2 / 1.023 ≈ 0.977 T2.

So, T1 is lower than T2.

So now, luminosity ratio:

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (T1^4 / T2^4 ) = 2.25 * (0.977)^4.

Earlier, I computed (0.977)^2 = 0.9545, so (0.977)^4 ≈ 0.9545^2 ≈ 0.911.

So,

2.25 * 0.911 ≈ 2.05.

Which is about 2.05, but that's not matching any options either.

Hmm, this is confusing. Perhaps the problem doesn't consider the Doppler shift and assumes same T, but that's not likely because they have same observed λ_max. Or perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the non-relativistic Doppler shift (which is λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v/c) ) for the shift, but that's an approximation.

Wait, let me try the non-relativistic approach.

If Star_2 is moving towards us, the Doppler shift is λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 - v/c ), because when moving towards, the observed wavelength is shorter.

So, λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 - v/c )

Similarly, λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

Given λ_obs1 = λ_obs2,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 (1 - v/c )

So,

( λ_rest1 )/( λ_rest2 ) = 1 - v/c → (b/T1)/(b/T2) )= 1 - v/c → T2 / T1 = 1 - v/c → T1 = T2 / (1 - v/c )

v/c is 700e3 / 3e8 = 7e5 /3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 - 0.023333 ) ≈ T2 / 0.976667 ≈ 1.0242 T2.

Hmm, which is similar to the relativistic calculation.

So,

T1 ≈ 1.024 T2.

Then, L1/L2 = (1.5^2) * (1.024)^4.

1.5^2 is 2.25.

Compute (1.024)^4.

1.024^2 = 1.048576.

1.048576^2 ≈ 1.101996.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 1.101996 ≈ 2.25 * 1.102 ≈ 2.4795.

Again, around 2.48, which is not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler effect and just calculate it based on radius and same temperature, but that would give L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, which is option A.

But that seems unlikely because the problem states that they have the same observed λ_max, which implies their temperatures are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't consider the Doppler effect and just sets the temperatures equal, but that would be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the stars are moving, but their velocities are small enough that the Doppler effect on the luminosity is negligible compared to the effect of radius.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the stars have the same intrinsic temperature because the observed λ_max is same, but that can't be true because of Doppler shift.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says, "assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So, the correct approach is:

1. Find T1 and T2 based on the observed λ_max, which are the same.

2. Compute L1 and L2 using L = 4π R² σ T^4.

So, the steps are:

a) Use the Doppler shift to find the relation between T1 and T2.

b) Compute L1/L2.

But earlier calculations don't match the options. Perhaps there is a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the luminosity ratio as follows.

Given that L ∝ R² T^4.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4 )/( R2² T2^4 )

= ( (1.5 R2)^2 / R2^2 ) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= 2.25 * (T1/T2 )^4.

Earlier, from Doppler effect, T1 is T2 multiplied by a factor.

In the case where Star_2 is moving towards us, T1 = T2 / 0.977 ≈ 1.0235 T2.

So,

(T1/T2 )^4 = (1.0235)^4 ≈ 1.09736.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.09736 ≈ 2.469.

But again, this is not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using non-relativistic Doppler and the velocities are small, so that T1 ≈ T2.

But that would give L1/L2 = 2.25, which is option A.

But the problem specifically says that the observed λ_max are the same, which would imply different T's unless they have same T, which would require same λ_rest, meaning same T, but that's only possible if their velocities are zero.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't require using the Doppler effect, but instead assumes that the stars have the same intrinsic temperature, but that would be incorrect because their observed λ_max are same, but their velocities are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about the intrinsic luminosities, not the observed flux. So, the Doppler effect affects the observed flux, but the intrinsic luminosity is L = 4π R² σ T^4.

But the problem says, "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So, they compute L1 and L2, which are intrinsic.

But how?

They have same observed λ_max, which is due to Doppler shift. So the intrinsic λ_rest would be different, leading to different T's.

So I think the correct approach is:

1. Use the Doppler shift to find T1 and T2.

2. Compute L1/L2.

But in my earlier calculation, it's not matching any of the options.

Wait, let me try another approach.

From the problem, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same.

Using Wien's law,

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So, for Star_1, since v_r1 = 0, λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

For Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Set λ_obs1 = λ_obs2,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But λ_rest = b / T.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

So,

T1 = T2 / sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

= T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

v2 is 700 km/s.

v2/c = 700e3 / 3e8 = 7e5/3e8 = 7/300 ≈ 0.023333.

So,

(1 - v2/c) = 0.9766667

(1 + v2/c) = 1.0233333

So,

(1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) = 0.9766667 / 1.0233333 ≈ 0.9544.

Square root is sqrt(0.9544) ≈ 0.977.

So,

T1 = T2 * 0.977.

Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier.

Wait, no, because v2 is positive (moving away), so Star_2 is moving away, so its observed λ is longer.

Hmm, but the problem states that the observed λ_max are same.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that Star_2 is moving towards us, which would make λ_obs2 smaller than λ_rest2. But for Star_1, λ_obs1 = λ_rest1. So, to have λ_obs2 = λ_obs1, Star_2's λ_rest must be longer than Star_1's. So, Star_2 is hotter.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let's try to approach this systematically.

If Star_2 is moving towards us (v_r = +700 km/s, meaning approaching), then:

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Because when the source is moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength is shorter.

So,

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Set this equal to λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Which implies,

λ_rest2 = λ_rest1 / sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

= λ_rest1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

λ_rest2 = λ_rest1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which implies that T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Because λ_rest = b/T.

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

= T1 * sqrt(0.9766667/1.0233333 )

= T1 * sqrt(0.9544) ≈ T1 * 0.977.

So, T2 ≈ 0.977 T1.

So, T1 is higher than T2.

Now, compute L1/L2.

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4.

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4 )/( R2² T2^4 )

= ( (1.5 R2)^2 / R2^2 ) * (T1^4 / (0.977 T1 )^4 )

= 2.25 * (1/(0.977)^4 )

Compute (0.977)^4.

Earlier, we found that (0.977)^2 ≈ 0.9545.

So,

(0.9545)^2 ≈ 0.911.

So,

1/(0.911) ≈ 1.097.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.097 ≈ 2.469.

But again, this is not matching any options.

Hmm, but another approach: perhaps the problem is not considering the Doppler effect because the velocities are low, and thus the change in temperature is negligible. So, T1 ≈ T2.

In that case, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, which is option A.

But why would the problem mention the velocities if they're negligible? That seems inconsistent.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the problem differently. Let's think about the flux received by the observer.

The luminosity is intrinsic, but the flux observed depends on distance and any Doppler effects.

But the problem says, "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So, the question is about intrinsic luminosities, not observed fluxes.

But how do they compute the luminosity? Using the observed data.

Wait, the observed λ_max gives the effective temperature, which is affected by Doppler shift. So, the stars' effective temperatures can be determined from their observed λ_max.

So, for Star_1, observed λ_max is λ_rest1.

For Star_2, observed λ_max is λ_rest2 * Doppler factor.

But since the observed λ_max are same, we can calculate T1 and T2.

Wait, but this is what I tried earlier. So perhaps the correct approach is leading to an answer not in the options, which suggests that I might have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the radial velocities are not causing a Doppler shift in the peak wavelength because the problem states that the stars are moving with radial velocities, but their peak wavelengths are the same. So, perhaps the Doppler effect is being ignored, and the temperatures are considered the same.

But that would give L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25, which is option A.

But the problem gives the velocities, so I think that would be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the stars' temperatures are same, because the observed λ_max are same, but that's only true if they have same velocities, which they don't. So that can't be.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me summarize:

Given:

- R1 = 1.5 R2

- M1 = 1.5 M2 (probably not relevant here)

- λ_obs1 = λ_obs2

- v1 = 0, v2 = 700 km/s.

The goal is to compute L1/L2.

L = 4π R² σ T^4.

But T is determined by λ_rest, which is determined via Doppler shift.

So, the steps are:

1. Find T1 and T2 such that λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

2. Compute L1/L2.

From step 1,

λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Set equal: λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Which implies,

T1 = T2 / sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

= T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

v2/c is 7e5 /3e8 = 7/300 ≈ 0.02333.

So,

(1 - v2/c) = 0.9766667.

(1 + v2/c) = 1.023333.

So,

sqrt(0.9766667 / 1.023333 ) = sqrt(0.9544) ≈ 0.977.

So,

T1 = T2 * 0.977.

So, T1 is lower than T2.

Wait, that can't be. If Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ is longer, so its λ_rest must be shorter. So, T2 would be higher.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

If Star_2 is moving away, the observed λ is longer than λ_rest2. So,

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which is longer than λ_rest2.

But λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

If λ_obs1 = λ_obs2,

then,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which implies,

λ_rest1 > λ_rest2 → T1 < T2.

So, T1 is lower than T2.

So, in that case,

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4 )/(R2² T2^4 )

= (2.25) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= 2.25 * (0.977)^4.

Earlier, (0.977)^2 = 0.9545 → (0.977)^4 = 0.911.

So,

2.25 * 0.911 ≈ 2.25 * 0.911 ≈ 2.049.

Which is approximately 2.05.

But that's not matching any options.

Wait, the options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

Hmm. 2.05 is close to 2.25 but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (0.977)^4.

Wait, 0.977^4.

Compute 0.977^2 = 0.9545.

0.9545^2 = (approx) 0.911.

Wait, perhaps more accurately:

0.9545 * 0.9545.

= (0.95 + 0.0045)^2.

= 0.95² + 2*0.95*0.0045 + (0.0045)^2.

= 0.9025 + 0.00855 + 0.00002025 = 0.91107025.

So,

(0.977)^4 = 0.91107025.

So,

2.25 * 0.91107025 ≈ 2.25 * 0.911 ≈ 2.049.

So, roughly 2.05.

But again, that's not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering v as 700 km/s in the wrong direction.

If Star_2 is moving towards us, v_r = -700 km/s.

Then,

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + (-700e3)/(3e8) )/(1 - (-700e3)/(3e8) ) )

= λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - 0.023333)/(1 + 0.023333) )

= λ_rest2 * sqrt(0.976667/1.023333) ≈ λ_rest2 * 0.977.

Set equal to λ_obs1 = λ_rest1,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * 0.977 → λ_rest2 = λ_rest1 / 0.977 → T2 = T1 * 0.977.

So, T2 = 0.977 T1.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25) * ( (T1)^4 / (0.977 T1)^4 )

= 2.25 * (1 / (0.977^4) )

= 2.25 * (1/0.91107025)

≈ 2.25 * 1.0973657 ≈ 2.469.

Which again is not matching.

I'm really stuck here. Perhaps I should consider that the problem is expecting us to ignore the Doppler shift and assume same T, leading to L1/L2 = 2.25, which is option A.

But that seems to ignore the information given about the velocities and the observed λ_max. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to consider only the radius, and not the temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the observed brightness (apparent brightness) is same, but the question is about luminosity, which is intrinsic.

But the problem states that the astronomers computed the luminosities, so they must have accounted for the Doppler effect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is making a mistake in the setup, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value of L1/L2 without any approximations.

Let me compute (1.0235)^4 without approximation.

Compute (1.0235)^4:

First, 1.0235^2 = 1.04755225.

Then,

1.04755225^2 = ?

Let me compute 1.04755225 * 1.04755225.

I can break this down:

= (1 + 0.04755225)^2

= 1^2 + 2*1*0.04755225 + (0.04755225)^2.

= 1 + 0.0951045 + 0.0022612.

= 1.0973657.

So,

(1.0235)^4 ≈ 1.0973657.

So,

2.25 * 1.0973657 = ?

2.25 * 1 = 2.25.

2.25 * 0.0973657 = 0.2193735.

So,

Total is 2.25 + 0.2193735 = 2.4693735 ≈ 2.469.

But that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the non-relativistic Doppler shift formula, which is λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v/c).

Wait, for Star_2 moving away,

λ_obs2 ≈ λ_rest2 (1 + v/c )

Set equal to λ_obs1 = λ_rest1,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 (1 + v/c )

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + 0.023333 )

So,

λ_rest2 = λ_rest1 / 1.023333 → λ_rest2 ≈ 0.977 * λ_rest1.

Thus,

T2 = T1 * 0.977.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (T1^4 / (0.977 T1 )^4 )

= 2.25 * 1/(0.977^4 )

= 2.25 / 0.91107 → 2.25 / 0.91107 ≈ 2.469.

Same result as before.

Hmm.

At this point, I think the correct answer based on the calculations is approximately 2.47, but that's not an option. The closest option is B) ~2.32, but that's not close. Maybe there's a calculation mistake, but I don't see where.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift calculation. Let me re-express the formula correctly.

The correct relativistic Doppler shift formula when the source is moving away is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Set them equal,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which means,

λ_rest1 / λ_rest2 = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

(λ_rest1 / λ_rest2)^2 = (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c )

Which can be rearranged as,

(λ_rest1 / λ_rest2)^2 (1 - v/c ) = 1 + v/c.

Let me let x = λ_rest1 / λ_rest2.

Then,

x^2 (1 - v/c ) = 1 + v/c.

Bring all terms to one side,

x^2 (1 - v/c ) - (1 + v/c ) = 0.

Substitute v/c = 7/300 ≈ 0.023333.

So,

x^2 (0.9766667) - 1.0233333 = 0.

So,

x^2 = 1.0233333 / 0.9766667 ≈ 1.047.

So,

x = sqrt(1.047) ≈ 1.023.

So,

λ_rest1 / λ_rest2 ≈ 1.023 → λ_rest2 ≈ λ_rest1 / 1.023.

Which implies,

T2 = T1 * 1.023.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (1.023)^4.

Compute (1.023)^4.

(1.023)^2 = 1.046529.

(1.046529)^2 ≈ 1.095.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 1.095 = 2.46875.

Again, around 2.469.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to compute the luminosity ratio based on the observed flux, which would involve the Doppler effect in the flux calculation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the flux received by the observer is F = L / (4π d² ), but I don't think that's relevant here because the problem is about luminosity, not flux.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the Doppler effect on the observed flux, which would dim or brighten the star, but again, the question is about luminosity.

I think the correct approach leads to L1/L2 ≈ 2.47, but since that's not an option, perhaps the problem expects us to use the non-relativistic Doppler shift and calculate based on that.

But with non-relativistic Doppler shift,

λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v/c )

So,

λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 (1 + v/c )

Set equal,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 (1 + v/c )

→ λ_rest2 = λ_rest1 / (1 + v/c )

→ T2 = T1 (1 + v/c )

Because λ_rest is inversely proportional to T.

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + 0.023333 ) = 1.02333 T1.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25) * ( T1^4 / (1.02333 T1 )^4 )

= 2.25 * (1/(1.02333^4 )).

Compute 1.02333^4.

1.02333^2 ≈ 1.0473.

1.0473^2 ≈ 1.0964.

So,

1/1.0964 ≈ 0.912.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.912 ≈ 2.052.

Again, not matching the options.

I'm really stuck here. Perhaps the intended answer is option B) ~2.32, but I can't see how to get that.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact (1.0235)^4.

Compute 1.0235^4.

Compute step by step:

1.0235^2 = 1.04755225.

1.04755225^2:

= (1.04755225) * (1.04755225)

= 1*1 + 1*0.04755225 + 0.04755225*1 + 0.04755225^2.

Wait, more accurately, perhaps using a calculator-like approach.

1.04755225 * 1.04755225:

= 1.04755225 * 1 = 1.04755225

1.04755225 * 0.04755225

= (approx) 0.04975.

So, sum:

1.04755225 + 0.04975 ≈ 1.09730225.

So,

1.0235^4 ≈ 1.0973.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.0973 ≈ 2.469.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to use the non-relativistic Doppler shift, leading to L1/L2 = 2.47, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem made a mistake in the options, and the correct answer is not listed. But that's unlikely.

Another approach: perhaps the problem is considering that the stars' temperatures are the same because the observed λ_max are same. So, T1 = T2.

In that case, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, which is option A.

But that would ignore the Doppler effect, which seems inconsistent with the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the Doppler effect only affects the observed flux, not the temperature. But that's not correct because the observed peak wavelength depends on the Doppler shift.

Given that I can't find a way to get any of the given options, I think the intended approach is to ignore the Doppler effect and assume same temperature, leading to option A.

But I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the luminosity is proportional to R^2 T^4, and considering that the observed λ_max same implies T_obs same, but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for luminosity in terms of observed parameters, such as apparent brightness, but I don't think so.

Wait, considering the problem again:

The problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor.

So, they must have accounted for the Doppler shift in their calculations.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Doppler shift factor.

Let me compute the exact (1.0235)^4.

1.0235^2 = 1.04755225.

1.04755225^2 = ?

Compute it accurately:

1.04755225 * 1.04755225.

Break it into (1 + 0.04755225)^2.

= 1^2 + 2*(1)*0.04755225 + (0.04755225)^2.

= 1 + 0.0951045 + 0.0022612.

= 1.0973657.

So,

(1.0235)^4 ≈ 1.0973657.

So,

2.25 * 1.0973657 = 2.25 * 1.0973657 ≈ 2.469.

But that's not an option. The options are A:2.25, B:2.32, C:2.35, D:2.23.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate (1.0235)^4 more accurately.

Compute 1.0235^2 = 1.04755225.

Now, 1.04755225^2:

Compute 1.04755225 * 1.04755225.

Using more precise method:

1.04755225
×1.04755225
-------------

Let me compute it step by step.

1.04755225 × 1.04755225 =

= 1.04755225 × 1 = 1.04755225

+ 1.04755225 × 0.04 = 0.04190209

+ 1.04755225 × 0.007 = 0.00733286575

+ 1.04755225 × 0.00055225 = ?

Wait, perhaps it's getting too time-consuming, but I can accept that (1.0235)^4 is approximately 1.0973657.

Thus, the calculation leads to L1/L2 ≈ 2.469.

But none of the options match. Hence, I think the problem expects the answer to be approximately 2.25, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of T1 and T2.

Wait, another way: perhaps the problem expects to compute the ratio using the observed λ_max as same, implying the same temperature, but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the Doppler effect on the luminosity as a factor, but I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent on this, I'll proceed to select the closest option to my calculation.

But since none match, perhaps the intended answer is option B) ~2.32, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (1.0235)^4. Let me compute it precisely.

Compute 1.0235^4.

We have:

1.0235^2 = 1.04755225.

1.04755225^2:

= 1.04755225 * 1.04755225.

Let me compute this using more precise steps.

Multiply 1.04755225 × 1.04755225.

Break it into:

= (1 + 0.04755225) × (1 + 0.04755225)

= 1 × 1 + 1 × 0.04755225 + 0.04755225 × 1 + 0.04755225 × 0.04755225.

= 1 + 0.04755225 + 0.04755225 + 0.0022612.

= 1 + (0.0951045) + 0.0022612.

= 1.0973657.

So, again, 1.0973657.

Thus, 2.25 * 1.0973657 ≈ 2.469.

I think the correct answer based on the calculation is approximately 2.47, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option B) ~2.32.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use the Doppler factor as (1 + v/c) for temperature, but not considering the relativistic effect.

Wait, let's compute it that way.

Assume T is affected by the Doppler shift as T_observed = T_intrinsic * (1 + v/c).

For Star_2 moving away, T_obs2 = T2 * (1 + v/c) = T2 * 1.02333.

But since the observed λ_max are same, the observed temperatures are same, so T_obs1 = T_obs2.

For Star_1, T_obs1 = T1.

For Star_2, T_obs2 = T2 * 1.02333.

Set equal: T1 = T2 * 1.02333.

Thus, T1 = 1.02333 T2.

Now, compute L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4 )/( R2² T2^4 )

= (2.25) * (1.02333)^4.

Compute (1.02333)^4.

1.02333^2 = approx 1.0473.

1.0473^2 ≈ 1.0964.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 1.0964 ≈ 2.468.

Again, same result.

So, perhaps the problem's options are incorrect, or I'm missing something.

Given the options, and the closest being option B) ~2.32, but I can't reach that number. Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial Doppler shift assumption.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But when the source is moving towards the observer, v is positive, so the observed wavelength is shorter.

So, for Star_2 moving towards us (v_r = 700 km/s):

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, no, if the source is moving towards, v is positive, and the formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, no, that's when the source is moving away. When the source is moving towards, the formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Ah, so I think I made a mistake earlier. The correct formula when the source is moving towards the observer is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So, for Star_2 moving towards us (v_r = +700 km/s), we have:

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Set this equal to λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Which implies,

λ_rest2 = λ_rest1 / sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

= λ_rest1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

λ_rest2 = λ_rest1 * sqrt( (1 + 0.023333)/(1 - 0.023333) )

= λ_rest1 * sqrt(1.023333 / 0.9766667 )

≈ λ_rest1 * sqrt(1.047) ≈ λ_rest1 * 1.023.

Thus,

λ_rest2 ≈ 1.023 λ_rest1 → T2 = T1 / 1.023 ≈ 0.977 T1.

Now, compute L1/L2.

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (T1^4 / (0.977 T1)^4 )

= 2.25 * (1/(0.977^4 )).

Compute (0.977)^4 ≈ 0.911.

So,

2.25 / 0.911 ≈ 2.469.

Again, same result.

I'm really stuck. I think the intended answer is option A) ~2.25, but I can't see how that's correct with the given parameters.

Wait, an alternative approach: perhaps the problem is considering that the observed λ_max are same, so the intrinsic T's are same, and so the L ratio is just (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

So, option A.

But that seems to ignore the Doppler shift, which I think is part of the problem's intent.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that the correct answer is approximately 2.47 and the closest option is not present, but since that's not the case, I'll have to proceed.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, based on their given properties. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2 and a mass 1.5 times that of Star_2. The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, and Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, while Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s. The stars are assumed to radiate as blackbodies.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Wien's Law and Doppler Effect**:
   - The observed wavelength at which a star appears brightest is given by Wien's law:  
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
     \]
     where \(v\) is the radial velocity and \(c\) is the speed of light. Since the observed wavelengths (\(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\)) are the same for both stars, the intrinsic wavelengths (\(\lambda_{\text{rest}}\)) must differ due to the Doppler effect.

2. **Relating Temperatures**:
   - Using Wien's law, \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} = b/T\), where \(b\) is Wien's displacement constant and \(T\) is the temperature. For Star_1 (\(v_1 = 0\)) and Star_2 (\(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\)), the relationship between their intrinsic temperatures is derived as:
     \[
     T_1 = T_2 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}
     \]
     Substituting \(v_2/c = 700 \times 10^3 / 3 \times 10^8 \approx 0.02333\), the temperature ratio becomes:
     \[
     T_1 \approx T_2 \cdot 0.977
     \]

3. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   - The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:  
     \[
     L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
     \]
     where \(R\) is the radius and \(T\) is the temperature. The ratio of the luminosities is:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
     \]
     Substituting \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\) and \(T_1 = 0.977 T_2\), the ratio becomes:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{1.5 R_2}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = 2.25 \cdot (0.977)^4
     \]
     Calculating \((0.977)^4 \approx 0.911\), the luminosity ratio is:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \cdot 0.911 \approx 2.05
     \]

4. **Revisiting the Doppler Direction**:
   - If Star_2 is moving toward the observer (rather than away), the Doppler shift formula changes, and the temperature ratio becomes:
     \[
     T_1 = T_2 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
     \]
     This leads to \(T_1 \approx 1.0235 T_2\). Recomputing the luminosity ratio:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot (1.0235)^4
     \]
     With \((1.0235)^4 \approx 1.097\), the ratio becomes:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \cdot 1.097 \approx 2.47
     \]

5. **Final Considerations**:
   - The calculated luminosity ratio depends on the direction of Star_2's motion. If moving away, the ratio is approximately \(2.05\); if moving toward, it is approximately \(2.47\). Neither matches the provided options exactly. However, if the problem assumes the same intrinsic temperature (ignoring Doppler effects), the ratio simplifies to:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = 2.25
     \]
     This corresponds to **Option A**.

### Conclusion:
The problem's phrasing suggests that the Doppler effect is intended to be considered, but the exact calculations do not align with the provided options. If the Doppler effect is ignored and the stars are assumed to have the same intrinsic temperature, the luminosity ratio is \(2.25\), corresponding to **Option A**.

Answer: A
