Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a star with some spots and how that affects the observed brightness variations. They're comparing this to the effect a planet would have, and we need to find out what planet radius would give the same brightness variation.

So, the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of that hemisphere is spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K. The spots are cooler, I suppose, because they're dark. The temperature difference is 1000K, but wait, is it the spots 1000K less than the star's Teff? Oh yeah, probably.

When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness changes. But because only one hemisphere is spotty, the brightness variation as it rotates would be periodic. Now, the tricky part is that this can mimic an exoplanet in some way. The problem asks, if instead of spots, there was a planet, what radius would that planet need to have to produce the same amplitude in the light curve.

So, I need to calculate the change in brightness caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same change.

First, let me think about how brightness change works. For a planet blocking the star (like in the transit method), the brightness drops by the area of the planet relative to the star. Because the planet is much smaller, it's a small dip.

But for the starspots, it's a bit different. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the star's total brightness decreases because those spots emit less light. So, the amplitude of the variation would depend on how much the spots contribute to the total light and how much of them is visible as the star rotates.

Wait, but the question says that the star is not covered by spots, but in this case, it is. So, we need to compute the brightness variation due to the spots and then find a planet that would cause the same dip.

Let me break it down.

First, find the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots.

The star's total brightness (luminosity) when spots are present will be a combination of the unspotted and spotted regions. But since the spots are cooler, each spot contributes less flux than the surrounding.

The flux from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σ T^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, for the star without any spots, the total flux is F_star = σ T_star^4.

When spots are present, the flux is F_total = (1 - f) * F_unspotted + f * F_spotted, where f is the filling factor of the spots on the hemisphere.

Wait, but the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So, f is 20% or 0.2.

But wait, only one hemisphere is covered. So, the spots are on one side of the star. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go away as the other hemisphere comes around.

So, the maximum change in brightness would be when the spotty hemisphere is fully visible or when it's not.

Wait, no. The change would be when the spotty area is either entering or exiting the view. So the brightness variation would be the difference between when the spots are visible and when they're not.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me model this.

The star's disk is a sphere, so the hemisphere that's facing us has an area of (4π R^2)/2 = 2π R^2. So the total area of the hemisphere is 2π R².

The spots cover a fraction f of this hemisphere. So the area of the spots is f * 2π R².

Each spot has a temperature T_spot = T_star - 1000 K = 6000K - 1000K = 5000K.

The flux from the star without spots is F_0 = σ T_star^4.

The flux when the spots are visible is F = F_0 * (1 - f) + σ T_spot^4 * f.

Wait, no. Because the unspotted part is (1-f) fraction of the hemisphere, so their flux is (1-f) * F_0, and the spots contribute f * σ T_spot^4.

But wait, the star's total flux when part is spotted would be the sum of the unspotted and spotted regions.

So the fractional change in flux when the spots are visible would be ΔF = F_spotted - F_unspotted.

Wait, but F_unspotted is the flux when the star is not showing any spots. But in reality, the star is always showing one hemisphere, but when it's not spotted, the hemisphere is entirely unspotted. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, no, the star is currently in a state where one hemisphere is entirely covered with spots (with filling factor 20% of that hemisphere). So when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view, but only 20% of it is spots. Wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered. So the entire hemisphere is the star's surface, and 20% of that is covered in spots.

Wait, no. The filling factor is the fraction of the total surface area that is spots. Wait, no, the question says "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Oh, so of that hemisphere, 20% is spots. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (area of hemisphere).

The area of the hemisphere is 2π R². So spots area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

The rest of the hemisphere is unspotted, which is area 1.6π R².

So the total flux emitted when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is:

F_spotted = (1.6π R²) * σ T_star^4 + (0.4π R²) * σ T_spot^4.

The flux when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us is F_unspotted = (2π R²) * σ T_star^4.

So the change in flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is F_spotted - F_unspotted.

Wait, no, when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted. When the other hemisphere (completely unspotted) is visible, the flux is F_unspotted.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation would be the difference between these two.

Wait, but the star is a sphere. So when you view it, you're seeing either the spotted or the unspotted hemisphere, depending on the rotation. So the variation would be between F_unspotted and F_spotted.

So the difference in flux is ΔF = F_spotted - F_unspotted.

Wait, but F_spotted is less than F_unspotted because the spots are cooler. So the brightness would decrease by ΔF when the spots are visible.

So the fractional change is ΔF / F_unspotted.

Let me compute that.

F_spotted = (1.6 π R²) σ T_star^4 + (0.4 π R²) σ T_spot^4.

F_unspotted = 2 π R² σ T_star^4.

So F_spotted = σ π R² [1.6 T_star^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 ].

F_unspotted = 2 σ π R² T_star^4.

So,

ΔF = F_spotted - F_unspotted = σ π R² [1.6 Tstar^4 + 0.4 Tspot^4 - 2 Tstar^4 ]

= σ π R² [ -0.4 Tstar^4 + 0.4 Tspot^4 ]

= 0.4 σ π R² (Tspot^4 - Tstar^4 )

So the fractional change is ΔF / F_unspotted = [0.4 (Tspot^4 - Tstar^4) ] / (2 Tstar^4 )

Simplify:

= [0.4 (Tspot^4 - Tstar^4) ] / (2 Tstar^4 )

= [ 0.2 (Tspot^4 - Tstar^4) ] / Tstar^4

= 0.2 [ (Tspot^4 / Tstar^4) - 1 ]

So plugging in the numbers:

Tspot = 5000 K, Tstar = 6000 K.

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

5/6 is approximately 0.8333.

0.8333^4: Let's compute that.

0.8333^2 ≈ 0.6944. Then square that: ~0.6944^2 ≈ 0.48225.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So:

0.2 * (0.48225 - 1) = 0.2 * (-0.51775) = -0.10355.

So the fractional change is about -10.355%. But since we're looking for the amplitude, we take the absolute value, so about 10.355% decrease.

So the star's brightness variations have an amplitude of about 10.35% when the spots are visible.

Now, the question is, what planet radius would cause the same amplitude when it transits the star.

When a planet transits the star, it blocks part of the star's light. The fractional change in brightness is (R_planet / R_star)^2, but wait, only if the planet's area is much smaller than the star's. Wait, but actually, the change is (Area_planet / Area_star) = (R_planet^2 / R_star^2).

But in reality, the transit depth is (Rp / Rstar)^2.

Wait, but the transit depth is the fractional decrease in brightness, which is (Rp^2) / (Rstar^2).

So, in our case, the transit depth would be (Rp / Rstar)^2.

We want this to equal the fractional change we found from the spots, which is 0.10355 (about 10.355%).

So, set (Rp / Rstar)^2 = 0.10355.

Taking square root, Rp / Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.316.

Wait, sqrt(0.10355) is approximately 0.322.

Wait, let's compute it accurately.

0.10355.

Calculating square root:

What's 0.32^2? 0.1024.

0.32^2 = 0.1024.

0.322^2 = let's see: 0.32 * 0.32 is 0.1024, plus 0.002 * (2*0.32 + 0.002 ) ) ) → 0.322^2 = (0.32 + 0.002)^2 = 0.32² + 2*0.32*0.002 + 0.002² = 0.1024 + 0.00128 + 0.000004 = 0.103684.

Which is close to 0.10355. So sqrt(0.10355) is approximately 0.322.

So Rp / Rstar ≈ 0.322. So about 0.32.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check.

Wait, earlier I calculated the fractional change as 10.355%, which is 0.10355.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.322.

So approximately 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

Hmm, but let's make sure I didn't make a mistake in the spot calculation.

Wait, the star's flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is F_spotted = (1.6π R²) * σ Tstar^4 + (0.4π R²) * σ Tspot^4.

And F_unspotted is 2π R² σ Tstar^4.

So the delta F is F_spotted - F_unspotted = [ (1.6 Tstar^4 + 0.4 Tspot^4 ) - 2 Tstar^4 ) ] * σ π R².

Which is (1.6 Tstar^4 + 0.4 Tspot^4 - 2 Tstar^4 ) → (-0.4 Tstar^4 + 0.4 Tspot^4 )

So ΔF = 0.4 (Tspot^4 - Tstar^4) * σ π R².

Then, fractional change is ΔF / F_unspotted.

F_unspotted is 2π R² σ Tstar^4.

So:

ΔF / F_unspotted = [0.4 (Tspot^4 - Tstar^4) ] / [2 Tstar^4 ]

= 0.2 (Tspot^4 - Tstar^4) / Tstar^4

= 0.2 ( (Tspot / Tstar)^4 - 1 )

Which when Tspot=5000, Tstar=6000, gives (5/6)^4 = 0.48225.

So 0.2 (0.48225 -1 ) = 0.2 * (-0.51775) = -0.10355.

So fractional change is -10.355%. So the amplitude is 10.355%.

So for the planet, the transit depth is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.322.

So which option is that close to? Option D is ~0.32.

Hmm, but wait, option A is ~0.39, option D is ~0.32.

Wait, another thing to consider: when the spots are on one hemisphere, the maximum brightness change would be when the entire hemisphere is visible.

Wait, but in the initial situation, only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star rotates, the spotty hemisphere comes into view. So the brightness would drop by the difference between the two hemispheres.

Wait, but I think the initial calculation is correct.

Wait, another point: when the star is viewed from Earth, it's emitting the sum of all the flux from its surface. So the brightness variation would be the difference between when the spotty hemisphere is visible and when the other (unspotted) hemisphere is.

So, the calculation seems correct.

Thus, the planet's radius would need to be about 32% of the star's radius to produce the same dip in brightness.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

Wait, but let me check the possible mistake. Did I confuse the planet's effect with the spot effect correctly?

Yes. Because the spot effect is a dip in brightness due to cooler regions, and the planet effect is a dip due to blocking light. The calculation for the dip in each case is different.

Wait, another approach: The light curve amplitude caused by the spots is a dip of about 10.35%, and the planet would cause a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2. So set that equal to 0.1035 and solve for Rp/Rstar.

So yes, Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.322, so option D.

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots and equate it to the transit depth caused by the planet.

### Step 1: Brightness Variation Due to Spots
The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, and one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K (i.e., 5000 K). The brightness variation arises because the spots emit less flux than the unspotted regions.

The total flux from the star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:  
\[
F = \sigma T^4
\]
where \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the total flux is a combination of the unspotted and spotted regions:
\[
F_{\text{spotted}} = (1 - f) F_{\text{unspotted}} + f F_{\text{spotted}}
\]
where \( f = 0.2 \) is the filling factor. Substituting the fluxes:
\[
F_{\text{spotted}} = (1 - 0.2) \sigma T_{\text{star}}^4 + 0.2 \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4
\]
\[
F_{\text{spotted}} = 0.8 \sigma T_{\text{star}}^4 + 0.2 \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4
\]

The flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible is:
\[
F_{\text{unspotted}} = \sigma T_{\text{star}}^4
\]

The change in flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is:
\[
\Delta F = F_{\text{spotted}} - F_{\text{unspotted}}
\]
\[
\Delta F = (0.8 \sigma T_{\text{star}}^4 + 0.2 \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4) - \sigma T_{\text{star}}^4
\]
\[
\Delta F = -0.2 \sigma T_{\text{star}}^4 + 0.2 \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4
\]
\[
\Delta F = 0.2 \sigma \left( T_{\text{spot}}^4 - T_{\text{star}}^4 \right)
\]

The fractional change in brightness is:
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{unspotted}}} = \frac{0.2 \sigma \left( T_{\text{spot}}^4 - T_{\text{star}}^4 \right)}{\sigma T_{\text{star}}^4}
\]
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{unspotted}}} = 0.2 \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{star}}^4} - 1 \right)
\]

Substituting \( T_{\text{star}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \):
\[
\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{star}}} = \frac{5000}{6000} = \frac{5}{6} \approx 0.8333
\]
\[
\left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{star}}} \right)^4 = (0.8333)^4 \approx 0.4823
\]
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{unspotted}}} = 0.2 \left( 0.4823 - 1 \right) = 0.2 \times (-0.5177) \approx -0.1036
\]

The amplitude of the brightness variation is the absolute value of this fractional change:
\[
\text{Amplitude} \approx 10.36\%
\]

### Step 2: Transit Depth of the Exoplanet
The transit depth caused by a planet is given by:
\[
\text{Transit Depth} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
\]
We set this equal to the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots:
\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1036
\]
\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1036} \approx 0.322
\]

### Step 3: Matching the Options
The closest option to \( 0.322 \) is **D) ~0.32**.
