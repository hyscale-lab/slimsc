Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The problem says we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because when you measure probabilities, you need the state to be normalized (i.e., the sum of the squares of the amplitudes should be 1).

Wait, the question says it's "proportional", so maybe I should normalize it before proceeding. Let me note that down. So the state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let me denote these as coefficients. So the coefficient for |up> is (1+i), and for |down> is (2 - i). 

To normalize, the square of the magnitude of each coefficient is calculated. So for |up>, |1+i|² is (1)² + (1)² = 2. For |down>, |2 -i|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5. So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Next, the question is about measuring the eigenstates of an operator whose matrix representation A is given by A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, what does that look like? Let me think. For a 2x2 system (since we have up and down states), the matrix A would have 0 on the diagonal and hbar/2 on the off-diagonal.

So, matrix A is:
[ 0,   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2,  0 ]

Hmm, wait, no. Because for a 2x2 matrix, each diagonal element A_ii is zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So yeah, that's correct.

I remember that when an operator is represented as a matrix, the eigenstates correspond to its eigenvectors, and the eigenvalues are the corresponding values. So to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix A.

Wait, but the question asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates. Oh, wait, for any observable, the eigenstates form a basis, and the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude when the state is expressed in that basis.

So first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A. Then, express |alpha> in terms of these eigenvectors and compute the probabilities.

Alternatively, maybe we can diagonalize matrix A. Let me think. The matrix A is a 2x2 symmetric matrix. So its eigenvectors will be orthogonal.

The general form for a 2x2 matrix with zero diagonal and a off-diagonal elements is:

A = [ [0, a], [a, 0] ]

For our case, a = hbar/2.

The eigenvalues of such a matrix can be found by solving det(A - λ I) = 0.

So the determinant is ( -λ ) ( -λ ) - (a)^2 = λ² - a² =0.

So λ² = a² → λ = ±a.

So the eigenvalues are λ_+ = a = hbar/2 and λ_- = -a = -hbar/2.

Now, the eigenvectors can be found for each eigenvalue.

For λ = a = hbar/2:

We solve (A - (hbar/2) I) |v> = 0.

The matrix becomes:
[ -hbar/2, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]

Which simplifies to equations:

- (hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [1, 1]^T.

Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2:

The matrix becomes:
[ hbar/2, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, hbar/2 ]

Which gives equations:

(hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0 → v1 +v2 =0 → v2 = -v1.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [1, -1]^T.

But wait, these eigenvectors are not normalized. So to normalize them, for [1,1], the magnitude is sqrt(1^2 +1^2 )= sqrt(2), so the normalized eigenvectors are (1/sqrt(2)) [1,1]^T and (1/sqrt(2)) [1,-1]^T.

But wait, the matrix A is for the spin operator, but in the z-basis. So the eigenstates of this operator are these vectors, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

So the eigenstates are:

|eigen+> = (1/sqrt(2)) (|up> + |down> )

|eigen-> = (1/sqrt(2)) (|up> - |down> )

Wait, let me make sure. Because the eigenvectors are [1,1] and [1,-1], which correspond to (|up> + |down> ) and (|up> - |down> ), right? Since the basis is |up> and |down>.

So the eigenstates are |eigen+> and |eigen-> as I wrote.

Now, the state |alpha> is in the z-basis, with components (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

We need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates |eigen+> and |eigen->.

Because when we measure the operator (which has eigenstates |eigen+> and |eigen->), the probabilities are the square of the coefficients in this basis.

So let's write |alpha> in the eigen basis.

Let me denote |eigen+> = (|up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2) = (1/sqrt(2)) (|up> + |down> )

Similarly, |eigen-> = (|up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2).

We can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |eigen+> and |eigen->.

Let me write |alpha> = c_+ |eigen+> + c_- |eigen->.

So, substituting:

|alpha> = c_+ ( |up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2) ) + c_- ( |up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2 )

Let me group the terms:

= [ (c_+ + c_- ) / sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (c_+ - c_- ) / sqrt(2) ] |down>

But we already know that |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So, we can set up equations:

( c_+ + c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (1 + i ) / sqrt(7 )

( c_+ - c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i ) / sqrt(7 )

Let me write these as two equations:

Equation 1: (c_+ + c_- ) = sqrt(2/7) (1 + i )

Equation 2: (c_+ - c_- ) = sqrt(2/7) (2 - i )

Hmm. Let me solve these equations for c_+ and c_-.

Adding equations 1 and 2:

2 c_+ = sqrt(2/7) ( (1 + i) + (2 -i) )

= sqrt(2/7) (3 + 0i )

So c_+ = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7 ) = 3 * sqrt(2) / (2 * sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

2 c_- = sqrt(2/7) ( (1 + i ) - (2 - i) )

= sqrt(2/7) ( -1 + 2i )

So c_- = (sqrt(2/7) ( -1 + 2i )) / 2

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to solve for c_+ and c_-.

Alternatively, I can express c_+ and c_- in terms of the given expressions.

Alternatively, maybe I can write the coefficients as:

c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (2 sqrt(2)) ) * sqrt(7)
Wait, perhaps another approach is to express |alpha> in terms of |eigen+> and |eigen->.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate. Because the coefficient c_+ is the inner product <eigen+ | alpha>, and similarly for c_-.

Yes, that's right. Because |alpha> = c_+ |eigen+> + c_- |eigen->, so the inner product <eigen+ | alpha> is c_+.

So let's compute c_+ = <eigen+ | alpha>

=eigen+ is (|up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2)

So <eigen+ | alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up | + <down | ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) <up|down> + (1+i)/sqrt(7) <down|up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) <down|down> ]

But <up|down> is 0, so that simplifies things.

So:

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) *1 + (2 -i)/sqrt(7)* 1 ]

= (1/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7))) [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [3 + 0i ] → 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, c_- = <eigen- | alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] acting on |alpha>

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <up|down> - (1+i)/sqrt(7) <down|up> - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <down|down> ]

Again, <up|down> is 0.

So:

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

= (1/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7))) [ (1 + i) - (2 - i) ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1 - 2) + i (1 + 1) ) ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (-1) + 2i ]

So c_- = ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14 )

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|² and |c_-|².

Calculating |c_+|²:

c_+ = 3 / sqrt(14 )

So |c_+|² = (9) / 14 ≈ 0.642857, which is about 0.643, which is 9/14.

Similarly, |c_-|² = | (-1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14) |² = [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.357.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.643 and 5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, but the options don't have 9/14 as 0.64. Let me look at the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 ... 

Option B) 0.54, 0.46...

Option C) 0.28, 0.72...

Option D) 0.61, 0.29...

Hmm. 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64. So the first part of the answer would be 0.64 and 0.36? Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is around 0.357. So the probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36. That's very close.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of c_+ and c_-.

Wait, let me recalculate c_+.

c_+ is (3) / sqrt(14 )

Because sqrt(14) is about 3.7417, so 3 /3.7417 is about 0.8019. Then, the square is (0.8019)^2 ≈ 0.643, which matches 9/14.

Wait, 9/14 is exactly about 0.642857.

So, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

So 9/14 is approximately 0.64, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357. But the options have 0.36 as the second option, which is 5/14 is about 0.357, so 0.36 is a possible rounded figure.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the inner products.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of c_+.

c_+ = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 +i ) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7 )

Which is (1/sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) [ (1 +i + 2 -i ) ]

Which is (3) / (sqrt(14) )

So |c_+|^2 is 9/(14) = 0.642857.

Similarly, c_- is [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2) sqrt(7) )

Which is [ (1 -2) + (i +i ) ] = (-1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14 )

So |c_-|^2 is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357.

So probabilities are 9/14 (≈0.643) and 5/14 (≈0.357).

Looking back at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36. So that's a good match for the first part.

Now, the average value of the operator. The average value is the expectation value, which is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is the operator whose eigenstates are |eigen+> and |eigen->, with eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2, the expectation value is |c_+|^2 * (hbar/2) + |c_-|^2 * (-hbar/2).

Which is (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2 )

= [ (9/14 -5/14) ) ] (hbar/2 )

= (4/14) (hbar/2 )

= (2/7) (hbar/2 )

= hbar /7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A says average is hbar /7.

So option A matches the probabilities and the average.

Wait, but let me see if any other option matches this.

Option A) 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

Yes.

Wait, but let me also compute the expectation value another way, to make sure.

Alternatively, compute <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

The state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

The operator A has matrix elements A_ij as given.

So A is represented as:

[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

So when we compute A |alpha>, we get:

A |alpha> = [0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (hbar/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |up>
          + [ (hbar/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>

So,

A |alpha> = [ (hbar/2)(2 -i) / sqrt(7) ] |up> 
          + [ (hbar/2)(1 + i ) / sqrt(7 ) ] |down> 

Then, <alpha | A | alpha> is the inner product of |alpha> and A |alpha>.

So,

<alpha| A |alpha> = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7) , (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ [ (hbar/2)(2 -i) / sqrt(7) ], [ (hbar/2)(1 + i ) / sqrt(7 ) ] ]

Which is (1-i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2)(1 +i)/sqrt(7)

Factor out (hbar/2) / 7.

So,

= (hbar/2) / 7 [ (1 - i)(2 -i) + (2 + i)(1 + i) ]

Compute each term:

(1 - i)(2 -i ) = 2*(1) + 1*(-i) - 2i + i^2 = 2 -i -2i -1 = (2-1) + (-3i) )= 1 -3i.

(2 +i)(1+i) = 2*(1) + 2i +i*(1) +i^2 = 2 +2i +i -1 = (2-1) +3i = 1 +3i.

So adding them: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So,

<alpha| A |alpha> = (hbar/2) /7 * 2 = (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar /7.

Which confirms the earlier result.

So the average is hbar/7, and the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A is '0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7'.

But wait, let me also check if the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

9/14 is about 0.642857, which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places.

5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded.

So the first part is correct.

So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but in the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. So that matches.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves an electron in a quantum state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. To proceed, the state is normalized by dividing by the normalization factor, which is determined as follows:

The coefficients of |up⟩ and |down⟩ are (1+i) and (2-i), respectively. The squared magnitudes of these coefficients are |1+i|² = 2 and |2-i|² = 5. The total squared magnitude is 2 + 5 = 7, so the normalization factor is 1/√7. Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |up⟩ + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |down⟩.
\]

The operator in question has a matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is a symmetric matrix, and its eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0. The eigenvalues are λ = ±\(\frac{\hbar}{2}\). The corresponding eigenvectors are:

\[
|eigen+⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|up⟩ + |down⟩), \quad |eigen-⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|up⟩ - |down⟩).
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates, the state |α⟩ is expressed in terms of |eigen+⟩ and |eigen-⟩. The coefficients are calculated as:

\[
c_+ = \langle eigen+ | α \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
c_- = \langle eigen- | α \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
|c_+|^2 = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad |c_-|^2 = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

The average value of the operator is calculated as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = |c_+|^2 \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + |c_-|^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, comparing the results with the options:

- The probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357, which round to 0.64 and 0.36.
- The average value is \(\frac{\hbar}{7}\).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
