Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and water) to produce 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options given are A, B, C, D, each pairing A and B reagents.

Hmm. Let me think about each reaction one by one.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one is reacting with NaCN and reagent A. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. When ketones react with CN- (from NaCN), under certain conditions, they form cyanohydrins. Wait, what's a cyanohydrin? I remember that a cyanohydrin is formed when a carbonyl group reacts with cyanide. The reaction is typically done under acidic conditions because the cyanide ion is a good nucleophile, but it might not react quickly without some acid catalysis.

So the reaction would be: ketone + NaCN → cyanohydrin. The mechanism probably involves protonation of the carbonyl oxygen to make it a better leaving group, then attack by CN-.

So the reagent A here is likely an acid, because the formation of cyanohydrins usually requires acidic conditions. Looking at the options, A could be either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Because NaHSO3 (sodium bisulfite) is a source of H+ and HSO3^- ions. Wait, but NaHSO3 is a weaker acid than H3O+ (which is strong). Alternatively, maybe the reaction can be done with just NaCN and H+.

In the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures to make sure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding a cyanide would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So yeah, that's the cyanohydrin.

Cyanohydrin formation typically uses an acid catalyst. So reagent A must be an acid. The options for A are either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Now looking at the second reaction: the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Wait, that's a bit complex. The structure would have a benzyl group attached to a phenyl ring, connected via a butanenitrile chain, with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile.

The product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) has been converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). So the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid.

What conditions are needed for that? I recall that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The typical reagents for this are either strong acid (like HCl) with water, or perhaps a strong base. Wait, wait.

Wait, nitrile hydrolysis can occur under acidic or basic conditions. Let me think: acidic conditions would typically use HCl with heat, perhaps. Basic conditions might use something like NaOH and heat, followed by acid workup. Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid, which is more likely obtained under acidic conditions. Alternatively, maybe the reaction uses a strong acid catalyst.

In the second reaction, reagent B is H2O and B. So the reaction is hydrolysis of the nitrile. So under what conditions does nitrile hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid?

Alternatively, another possibility: maybe the nitrile is first converted into an amide, but that doesn't seem relevant here. Or perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.

Wait, maybe the reagent B is a strong acid, like HCl, which provides the H+ needed for the hydrolysis. Because in the second reaction, when you have a nitrile group, adding HCl and water would protonate the nitrile, leading to hydrolysis. But wait, I'm a bit hazy on the exact conditions. Let me think in more detail.

Nitrile hydrolysis can be done in two main ways: using H2O with a strong acid (like conc. HCl) and heat, or using H2O with a strong base (like KOH or NaOH) and heat, followed by acid workup.

So in this reaction, they're using H2O and reagent B. So the options for B are either HCl or CH3COOH (from the options). Wait, the options for B are either HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are:

Option A: A = H3O+, B= HCl

Option B: A = H3O+, B= CH3COOH

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B= HCl

Option D: A = NaHSO3, B= CH3COOH

Wait, the second reaction's reagent B is either HCl or CH3COOH. So which one is correct for nitrile to carboxylic acid.

I think that the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles typically uses HCl and water. Because when you have a nitrile, adding HCl and H2O (with perhaps some heating) would protonate the nitrile, leading to a series of steps where water attacks, and eventually you get the carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, maybe using H2SO4 as the acid. But in the options, we have HCl and CH3COOH.

So in the second reaction, B must be HCl if the hydrolysis is acid-catalyzed. Because if B is CH3COOH, which is a weaker acid, maybe it's not strong enough. Or perhaps under certain conditions, CH3COOH can still act as a catalyst.

Wait, but when dealing with nitriles, for the hydrolysis to acid, the usual reagent is HCl in water. For example, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids is often done with HCl and water, sometimes with heat.

So B would be HCl.

Going back to the first reaction. Reagent A is for the cyanohydrin formation. As I thought earlier, that requires an acid. So A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Which one is it? NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and HSO3^- ions. H3O+ is a strong acid. Let me think about the conditions for cyanohydrin formation.

Cyanohydrin formation generally uses a mild acid catalyst because the reaction is sensitive to strong acids. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's done under neutral conditions but with some acid. NaHSO3 is a mild acid since HSO3^- is a weak acid (pKa around 1.99, I think). Wait, no, H2SO3 (sulfurous acid) has pKa around 1.99, but HSO3^- is a weaker acid. So NaHSO3 would be a source of H+ in solution. 

Wait, but in the first reaction, the reagent is NaCN and A. So if A is H3O+, that's a strong acid, which might protonate the carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction uses NaHSO3 as the acid. Or H3O+.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the reaction conditions for cyanohydrin formation.

Cyanohydrins are formed when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with cyanide in the presence of an acid. The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. The nucleophilic cyanide then attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin.

The typical reagents for this are an acid, like HCl, H2SO4, or even H3O+.

In the first reaction, the reagents are NaCN and A. So NaCN is providing the cyanide ion, and A is the acid. So A must be an acid. So the options for A are either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Which is correct? I think that in the cyanohydrin formation, the acid can be a strong acid. For example, HCl is often used. But in the options, if A is H3O+ (which is H+ in water), that would provide the necessary acidic conditions.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+.

Now, looking at the options, which option has A as H3O+ and B as HCl? That's option A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me look at the product. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the cyanide added to the ketone, forming a secondary alcohol and the nitrile group.

Another thought: sometimes, when you have a ketone reacting with a nitrile under certain conditions, you might form a different product, but in this case, it's a straightforward cyanohydrin.

Now, the second reaction. The nitrile group is converted into a carboxylic acid. So the reagent B is HCl, as I thought.

So putting it together: the first reaction uses H3O+ (A is H3O+), and the second uses HCl (B is HCl). So the correct option would be option A.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. Option A says A is H3O+, B is HCl. So that fits.

But wait, another possibility is that the first step uses NaHSO3 as the acid. Let me think about that. NaHSO3 is a source of H+ as well. So perhaps it could be used as a mild acid. But then, what would the second reaction require?

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction uses H3O+ (which is just acid) and the second uses HCl as the acid for hydrolysis.

So the correct option is A: A is H3O+, B is HCl.

Wait, but let me think if there's any other possibility. Are there any other reagents that could be used?

Wait, another point: in the first reaction, the product is a secondary alcohol and nitrile. If the reaction were under basic conditions, would that be possible? No, because cyanide is a strong base, so maybe the reaction needs an acid to facilitate the nucleophilic attack.

So yes, acidic conditions are needed. So A must be an acid.

So in the options, the correct pair would be A = H3O+ and B = HCl, which is option A.

Wait, but another option is D: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH.

Wait, why would someone choose D?

Wait, perhaps in the second reaction, the conversion of nitrile to carboxylic acid requires a strong acid. If B is HCl, that's a strong acid. If B were CH3COOH, which is a weak acid, would that work?

I'm not sure, but I think that for the hydrolysis of nitriles to acids, a strong acid is necessary. So B should be HCl.

So the correct answer is option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the suitable reagents for two reactions:

1. **Reaction 1**: Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.  
   - This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, where the ketone reacts with cyanide under acidic conditions.  
   - Acidic conditions are required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic for the cyanide ion to attack.  
   - The options for A are H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) and NaHSO₃ (a mild acid). H₃O⁺ is more likely to provide the necessary acidic conditions for this reaction.  

2. **Reaction 2**: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (in the presence of H₂O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.  
   - This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.  
   - Nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid typically requires strong acidic conditions, such as HCl in water.  
   - The options for B are HCl (a strong acid) and CH₃COOH (a weak acid). HCl is more suitable for this reaction as it provides the necessary strong acidic environment.  

By analyzing the reagents and the reactions, the correct pairing is **A = H₃O⁺** for the first reaction and **B = HCl** for the second reaction. This corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A
