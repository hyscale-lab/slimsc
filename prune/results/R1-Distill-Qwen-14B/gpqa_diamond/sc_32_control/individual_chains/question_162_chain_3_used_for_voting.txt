Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. I remember that in general relativity, metrics often describe the geometry of spacetime, and that when you have a metric like this, it can sometimes represent a sphere or a hyperboloid, depending on the signature.

Pseudosphere... oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. In 2D, it's like a saddle shape. The metric might be representing something like that. I think the area would involve integrating over the surface, maybe using the metric to compute the area element.

Wait, the area element in 2D is usually sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Let me get the metric tensor from the given ds². The ds² is expressed in terms of dx and dy, so it's a 2-dimensional metric. The metric tensor components are g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), g_yy is the same, and g_xy and g_yx are zero since there are no cross terms.

So the determinant of the metric tensor g would be (32/(4 - x² - y²)) * (32/(4 - x² - y²)) - 0 (since off-diagonal terms are zero). So determinant g = (32)^2 / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

Wait, but when computing the area in 2D, the area element dA is sqrt(g) dx dy. So here, sqrt(g) would be 32/(4 - x² - y²). Because sqrt of (32/(4−x²−y²))^2 is 32/(4−x²−y²). 

So the area would be the integral of sqrt(g) over the region where the metric is defined. But wait, I should check the domain where the metric is valid. The denominator is 4 - x² - y². For the metric to be real, 4 - x² - y² must be positive, because otherwise you'd have a negative or zero denominator which would be bad. So 4 - x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² < 4. So the domain is a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

So the area A is the integral over x and y where x² + y² < 4 of (32)/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy. Hmm, how do I compute that? Let's switch to polar coordinates because of the circular symmetry. So x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy becomes r dr dθ. 

So substituting, the area becomes the integral from r=0 to r=2 (since x² + y² <4 → r<2), and θ from 0 to 2π. The integrand becomes 32/(4 - r²) * r dr dθ.

Wait, 32/(4 - r²) multiplied by r dr dθ. Let's factor out the constants. 32 is a constant, so the integral becomes 32 ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [ r dr / (4 - r²) ) ].

Let me compute the θ integral first: ∫0^2π dθ = 2π. Then the r integral is ∫0^2 (r dr)/(4 - r²).

Hmm, let me think about the r integral. Let me make a substitution u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr. When r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (r dr)/(4−r²) = ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ (-du/2) / u ].

Which is (-1/2) ∫(4 to 0) (1/u) du. That's the same as (1/2) ∫(0 to4) (1/u) du. So that's (1/2) [ln u ] from 0 to4. Wait, but wait, when u approaches 0, ln u approaches negative infinity. Oh no, that's a problem. Because r goes up to 2, so u=4−(2)^2=0. So the denominator approaches zero as r approaches 2.

Wait, but what's the integral? Let's recast it: ∫0^2 (r dr)/(4−r²) = ∫ (r dr)/(4−r²) from r=0 to 2.

Wait, maybe I did something wrong in substitution. Let me try again. Let u = 4 - r². Then du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) ( (-du/2) ) / u → (1/2) ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u) (-du). Wait, integrating from 4 to 0 would give me ∫4^0 (1/u) (-du) = ∫0^4 (1/u) du. So the integral becomes (1/2) ∫0^4 (1/u) du. But that diverges because ∫ near u=0, the integral of 1/u blows up.

Wait, but that can't be right because in the original problem, the denominator is 4−x²−y², which approaches zero as r approaches 2. So the integrand becomes infinite as r approaches 2. Does that mean the area is infinite? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. But perhaps I'm confusing the metric. Alternatively, maybe the metric represents something else. Let me think about the metric given.

Wait, the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So the line element is scaled by that factor, but in 2D. Wait, perhaps this is a 2D metric, so the surface is embedded in some higher-dimensional space. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 2D surface with a certain curvature.

Wait, another approach: compute the Gaussian curvature from the metric. The Gaussian curvature K can be found from the metric components. The formula involves the determinant of the Ricci tensor or some other combination, but perhaps a simpler way is to compute the Gaussian curvature from the metric.

Alternatively, for a metric diagonal in 2D, ds² = A(x,y) (dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature K is given by (1/(2A)) [ (d/dx (∂A/∂y) ) - (d/dy (∂A/∂x) ) ].

Wait, in this case, A(x,y) = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So ∂A/∂x = 32 * (2x)/(4 - x² - y²)^2. Similarly, ∂A/∂y = 32 * (2y)/(4 - x² - y²)^2.

Then, d/dx (∂A/∂y) is the derivative with respect to x of (32 * 2y)/(4 - x² - y²)^2. Since y is treated as a constant when taking derivative w.r. to x, it's 32*2y * derivative of (1/(4−x²−y²)^2) w.r. to x.

The derivative of (4−x²−y²)^(-2) w.r. to x is (-2)(4−x²−y²)^(-3) * (-2x) ) → 4x (4−x²−y²)^(-3).

So d/dx (∂A/∂y) = 32 * 2y * [4x/(4−x²−y²)^3] = (32 *2y *4x) / (4−x²−y²)^3 = 256 x y / (4−x²−y²)^3.

Similarly, d/dy (∂A/∂x) would be the derivative of (32 * 2x)/(4−x²−y²)^2 w.r. to y. That's 32*2x * derivative of (4−x²−y²)^(-2) w.r. to y → 32*2x * [ (-2)(-2y) (4−x²−y²)^(-3) ) ].

Wait, wait. Let me compute that correctly. The derivative of (4−x²−y²)^(-2) with respect to y is (-2)(4−x²−y²)^(-3) ) * (-2y) → 4y (4−x²−y²)^(-3).

So d/dy (∂A/∂x) = 32 * 2x * 4y/(4−x²−y²)^3 = 32*8xy / (4−x²−y²)^3 = 256 xy/(4−x²−y²)^3.

So the difference between d/dx (∂A/∂y) and d/dy (∂A/∂x) is zero, because both are 256xy/(denominator). So the numerator becomes zero. So K = (1/(2A)) [ 0 ] → K = 0.

Wait, but that's confusing because I thought a pseudosphere has constant negative curvature. So if K is zero, that's not a pseudosphere. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the derivatives. Let me recalculate d/dx (∂A/∂y). A is 32/(4−x²−y²). ∂A/∂y = 32 * (2y)/(4−x²−y²)^2. Then d/dx of that is 32 * 2y * d/dx [ (4−x²−y²)^(-2) ]

Which is 32 * 2y * (-2)(4−x²−y²)^(-3) * (-2x) → 32 * 2y * (4x)/(4−x²−y²)^3 → (256 x y)/(4−x²−y²)^3.

Similarly, for ∂A/∂x = 32*(2x)/(4−x²−y²)^2. d/dy of that is 32 * 2x * (-2)(4−x²−y²)^(-3) * (-2y) → 32 * 2x * (4y)/(4−x²−y²)^3 → 256 x y/(4−x²−y²)^3.

So the difference is zero. So the Gaussian curvature K is (1/(2A)) * (0) → K=0. Hmm, that suggests the surface is flat, but that can't be right because a pseudosphere is curved.

Wait, maybe I should think about this differently. Wait, the metric given is in 2D, but perhaps it's part of a higher-dimensional spacetime. Alternatively, maybe it's a metric on a 2D surface embedded in 3D or 4D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the given metric represents a 2D surface with a specific area. Let me think again about the area integral.

The area A is the integral of sqrt(det g) dx dy. We had sqrt(g) = 32/(4−x²−y²). So the integral is ∫∫ [32/(4−x²−y²)] dx dy, integrated over x² + y² <4.

Changing to polar coordinates, x² + y² = r², so the integral becomes ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4−r²)] r dr dθ.

Which is 32*2π ∫0^2 [ r/(4−r²) ] dr.

Let me compute that integral. Let u = 4−r², du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ ( -du/2 ) / u ] → (1/2) ∫ (from 0 to4) (1/u) du.

Which is (1/2) [ ln(u) ] from 0 to4 → (1/2)(ln4 - ln0). Wait, but ln0 is negative infinity. So the integral becomes (1/2)(ln4 - (-infty)) → (1/2)(infinity) → infinity.

So the area is infinite. But that can't be right because a pseudosphere should have finite area. Or am I misunderstanding the problem?

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps I'm miscalculating something. Alternatively, maybe the given metric isn't for a compact surface like a regular sphere but something else. Or maybe the pseudosphere in question has infinite area, like a hyperbolic plane.

Wait, but pseudospheres are finite surfaces, like the tractricoid. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused between different models. Alternatively, maybe the given metric is for a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area, but the question refers to a pseudosphere, which is finite.

Wait, maybe I should think about the metric's form in terms of known coordinate systems. The metric is ds² = (32)/(4−x²−y²) (dx² + dy²). Hmm, 4 is 2 squared, so perhaps it's scaled with radius 2.

Wait, another thought: in the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic geometry, the metric is ds² = 4/(1−x²−y²)^2 (dx² + dy²). But our metric is 32/(4−x²−y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me compare.

Let me see: 32/(4−x²−y²) = 8/( (4−x²−y²)/4 ) → but wait, perhaps scaling variables. Let me define u = x/2, v = y/2. Then x = 2u, y=2v. Then x² + y² = 4(u² + v²).

So substituting into the metric: 32/(4−4u²−4v²) ) (dx² + dy²) = 32/(4(1−u²−v²)) ) * (4 du² +4 dv²) ) → 32/(4(1−u²−v²)) *4 (du² + dv²) → (32 *4)/(4 (1−u^2 −v^2)) ) (du² + dv²) → (32)/(1−u²−v^2) (du² + dv²).

Wait, but the Poincaré disk metric is usually written as ds² = 4/(1−u²−v²)^2 (du² + dv²). So our transformed metric is 32/(1−u^2−v^2) (du² + dv²), which is different. So perhaps it's a different model or scaling.

Alternatively, maybe the metric is conformally related to the Poincaré disk. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the area is infinite because the surface extends to infinity within the disk of radius 2.

But the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. If the metric in the given coordinates covers a disk of radius 2, but the surface itself is a pseudosphere, perhaps the area is finite. But according to the integral, we have an infinite area, which would imply option D) +infty.

Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating the area. Let me double-check the integral. The integral of 32/(4−x²−y²) over x²+y² <4. In polar coordinates, it's 32 ∫0^{2pi} dθ ∫0^2 [r/(4−r²)] dr.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the integral. Let me compute the r integral again. Let u =4−r^2 → du=−2r dr → r dr=−du/2. So the integral becomes ∫ (r dr)/(4−r²) )= ∫ ( (-du/2) ) / u → (-1/2) ∫ du/u.

The limits: when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes (-1/2) ∫4^0 du/u → (-1/2)( ln u evaluated from 4 to 0 ) → (-1/2)( ln0 - ln4 ) → (-1/2)( (-infinity) - ln4 ) → (-1/2)( -infty ) → positive infinity. So the integral is infinite.

So the area A is 32 * 2π * (infinite). So the area is infinite, which would correspond to option D) +infty.

But wait, the options are:

A) 0

B)4π(x²+y²)

C)4π(x²−y²)

D)+infty

So the correct answer would be D) +infty.

But wait, why is the area infinite? The pseudosphere should have finite area. Oh wait, perhaps I'm confusing the 2D surface of a pseudosphere (tractricoid) with the given metric. The tractricoid has finite area, but maybe the given metric represents a different kind of surface.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric actually represents a sphere with a coordinate singularity at r=2, making the area computation tricky.

Wait, but let's think: the given metric is a 2D metric. So the surface is a 2D surface. If the area integral diverges, that means the surface isn't compact; it's infinite in extent within the coordinate system. So perhaps it's the hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area.

But the question mentions a pseudosphere. Oh wait, a pseudosphere is a finite surface, but perhaps the metric given isn't that of a pseudosphere but of a hyperbolic plane. So the area would be infinite.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is mistakenly referring to a hyperbolic plane as a pseudosphere, but that's probably not the case. 

Wait, another thought: the metric for a 2-sphere in 3D is ds²= (r²)(dx² + dy²)/(x² + y²), but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe this is a 2D hyperbolic space, which has an infinite area.

So considering all this, the area would be infinite, so the answer is D.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

and the task is to compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\). 

### Key Observations:
1. **Domain of the Metric**: The metric is defined for \(4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0\), which corresponds to the region \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). This is a disk of radius 2 in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane.

2. **Area Element**: In 2D, the area element is given by \(\sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy\), where \(\det g\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. For the given metric, the determinant is:
   \[
   \det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
   \]
   Thus, the area element becomes:
   \[
   dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
   \]

3. **Polar Coordinates**: To compute the area, switch to polar coordinates where \(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\), and \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\). The integral for the area becomes:
   \[
   A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
   \]

4. **Simplifying the Integral**:
   - The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta\) evaluates to \(2\pi\).
   - The radial integral \(\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr\) is computed using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), which transforms the integral into:
     \[
     \int_4^0 \frac{-16}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
     \]
     This integral diverges because \(\int \frac{1}{u} \, du\) approaches infinity as \(u \to 0\).

5. **Conclusion**: The area integral diverges, indicating that the area of the surface described by the metric is infinite.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is clearly not zero.
- **B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this is not the result of the area computation.
- **C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this is not the result of the area computation.
- **D) \(+\infty\)**: Correct, as the area integral diverges.

### Final Answer:
The area of the pseudosphere described by the given metric is infinite.
