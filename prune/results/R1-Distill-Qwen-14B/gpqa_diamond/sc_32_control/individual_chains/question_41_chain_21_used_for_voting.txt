Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Right, I remember that when a medium is moving, it affects how light propagates through it, but wait, isn't the speed of light in a medium dependent on the medium's properties and not the motion of the medium itself? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

So the setup is: a light beam is moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame.

Wait, okay. Let me think about this. I know that the speed of light in a medium is generally given by v = c/n. But when the medium is moving, does that affect the speed of light as observed in the lab?

Wait, no, I think the speed of light inside the medium is always c/n, regardless of the medium's motion. Oh but wait, that's in the rest frame of the medium. What about from the lab's perspective when the medium is moving?

Hmm, this might be a case where I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because if the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, and light is moving at v_light relative to the glass, then the lab would see a different speed. 

Wait a second, the light's speed in the glass is c/n. But the glass is moving towards the observer. So, from the lab's frame, the speed of the light would be the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity relative to the glass, but wait, in which direction.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is also moving in the same direction as the glass (since the beam is propagating through the glass towards the observer). So the glass's velocity is v (towards observer), and the light's speed in the glass is c/n in the same direction. So would the lab measure the speed as v + (c/n) ?

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because in relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. Oh right, the relativistic velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²), but wait, but this is when you have velocities in the same direction. But wait, in this case, the medium is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving at c/n in the medium's frame. So from the lab frame, the light's speed would be u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c²))? 

Wait, but u is the speed of light in the medium's frame, which is c/n. So substituting, u' = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify that denominator: (1 + (v/(n c)) )

So the numerator is (c + n v)/n.

Wait, so u' would be ( (c + n v)/n ) / (1 + v/(n c) )

Which is [ (c + n v) / n ] * [ 1 / (1 + v/(n c) ) ]

Hmm, let's compute this. Let me factor out terms.

Wait, let me write the denominator as (n c + v ) / (n c )

So the entire expression becomes [ (c + n v) / n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

Simplify that: [ (c + n v) * n c ] / [ n (n c + v) ) ]

Wait, the n in the numerator and denominator cancels out. So we have [ (c + n v) * c ] / (n c + v )

Let me factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: c (c + n v )

Denominator: n c + v → same as c n + v.

Wait, so numerator is c(c + n v) = c² + c n v.

Denominator is n c + v. Hmm, perhaps I can factor something else.

Wait, maybe factor out n from the denominator? Not sure. Let me see.

Wait, the expression is [c (c + n v)] / (n c + v )

Hmm, perhaps factor out n from denominator: n (c) + v = n (c) + v → no, not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let me write the denominator as n c + v = c (n) + v. Hmm.

Wait, maybe we can factor c from numerator and denominator? Let's try:

Numerator: c (c + n v )

Denominator: c (n) + v → perhaps factor c out of denominator: c(n + v/(c)).

But that might not help directly. Alternatively, perhaps factor v from the denominator, but that's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps it's better to factor n out of the denominator. Wait, denominator is n c + v = n (c) + v → not much.

Wait, let me think about the options given. The options are:

A) (1 +n v)/(n +v )

B) 1

C) (1 +n v)/(n -v )

D) (1 -n v)/(n +v )

Wait, but I have c=1 in the problem, so let's substitute c=1.

So u' = [ (1 + n v ) * 1 ] / (n + v )

Because with c=1, c=1.

Wait, because earlier steps:

We had u' = [c (c +n v)] / (n c + v )

Substituting c=1, gives [1*(1 +n v)] / (n *1 + v) = (1 +n v)/(n +v )

Which is option A. So the speed of light is (1 + n v )/(n +v )

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Because in the problem, the glass is moving towards the observer. Oh wait, the beam is moving toward the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is toward the observer.

Wait, so in the lab frame, the glass is moving toward the observer at speed v. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the light's velocity in the lab frame should be higher than c/n.

Wait, but according to the calculation, with the relativistic addition, the speed is (1 +n v)/(n +v ). Which for small v (non-relativistic), would that make sense?

Wait, if v is small, say, non-relativistic, then (1 +n v)/(n +v ) ≈ (1 +n v) / (n (1 + v/n )) ) → approximately (1 +n v ) (1 - v/n ) / n → (1 +n v - v - v²/n ) /n → (1 + v (n-1) ) /n → as v approaches zero, it goes to 1/n, which is correct since c/n is 1/n when c=1.

Wait, but wait, I thought that in the non-relativistic limit, the speed of the light in the lab would be approximately (c/n + v ). So if c=1, it's (1/n + v ). But the expression I have is (1 +n v)/(n +v ) ≈ (1 +n v )/(n (1 + v/n )) ) → (1/(n) ) (1 +n v )/(1 + v/n ) → [ (1 +n v) / (n (1 + v/n )) ) ] → [ (1 +n v) ] / (n +v ) → Wait, perhaps my earlier approximation is not correct.

Wait, let me compute (1 +n v)/(n +v ) when v is small.

Let me write it as:

(1 +n v) / (n +v ) = [1 +n v ] / [n (1 + v/(n) ) ]

= [1/(n)] * [1 +n v ] / [1 + v/n ]

= [1/(n)] * [1 +n v ] [1 - v/n + (v/n)^2 - ... ] (using 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x )

= [1/(n)] [1 +n v - v/n + (v^2)/(n) - ... ]

Wait, but this seems a bit messy, perhaps a better approach is to expand numerator and denominator as a series in v.

Wait, for small v, (1 +n v) ≈ 1 +n v.

Denominator (n +v ) ≈ n (1 + v/n ) ≈ n (1 + v/(n )).

So (1 +n v)/(n (1 +v/n )) )= [1/(n)] (1 +n v) (1 - v/n + (v^2)/(n²) - ... )

Multiply out:

= [1/(n)] [ (1)(1) + (1)(-v/n ) + (n v)(1) + (n v)(-v/n ) + ... ]

So terms up to first order in v:

= [1/(n)] [1 - v/n + n v + higher order terms ]

= [1/(n)] [ 1 + (n v - v/n ) ]

= [1/(n)] [1 + v (n - 1/n ) ]

Hmm, but that doesn't seem to match the non-relativistic limit as I thought earlier. Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-relativistic limit (v << c=1) would give u' ≈ (1 +n v )/(n +v ) ≈ (1)/(n) + (v ) (n)/(n^2 ) ) → 1/n + v/(n )

Wait, because (1 +n v ) ≈ 1 and denominator n +v ≈n, so first approximation is 1/n. Then, considering next terms, maybe.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the Taylor expansion for (1 +n v)/(n +v ), treating v as small.

Let me write it as (1 +n v) / (n (1 + v/(n)) ) = (1/(n)) ) * [1 +n v ] * [1/(1 + v/n ) ]

Using the expansion 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x + x² - ..., for small x.

So,

= (1/n) [1 +n v ] [1 - v/n + (v^2)/(n²) - ... ]

Multiply them out:

= (1/n) [ (1)(1) + (1)(-v/n) + (n v)(1) + (n v)(-v/n ) + ... ]

= (1/n) [ 1 - v/n +n v - v² + ... ]

= (1/n) [ 1 + (n v - v/n ) + ... ]

= (1/n) [ 1 + v (n - 1/n ) + ... ]

= 1/n + v (n - 1/n ) /n + ... 

= 1/n + v (1 - 1/(n²) ) + ... 

Wait, for small v, the speed is approximately 1/n + v (1 - 1/n² ). Hmm, but in the non-relativistic case, the speed should approach (c/n + v ), since the medium is moving at v. So when c=1, it's (1/n + v ). But according to this, it's 1/n + v (1 - 1/n² ), which for n=1 is 1/1 + v (1 -1 )= 1 + 0 =1, which is correct, since for n=1, the glass is vacuum, and the speed is c=1, which works.

But wait, when n is large, say n is much larger than 1, then 1/n is small. So the speed would be 1/n + v (1 - 1/(n² )) ≈ 0 + v(1) )= v. But that doesn't make sense, because in reality, the speed of light in the medium is v_light = c/n. If the medium is moving towards the observer at speed v, the lab frame would see the light moving at v_light + v, but only in non-relativistic cases. But in reality, relativistic effects would make it different.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The calculation using the relativistic addition formula gives (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which matches option A.

Wait, let me check the setup again. The light is in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the relative velocity in the lab frame is based on adding the velocities using the relativistic formula.

Wait, wait a moment: the formula I used, (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c² ), is correct when the velocities are in the same direction. Because u is the velocity of the light in the medium's frame, and v is the velocity of the medium relative to the lab.

So the lab sees the light moving at u' = (u + v )/(1 + (u v)/c² )

But in the medium's frame, the light's speed is u = c/n =1/n (since c=1).

So substituting, u' = ( (1/n ) + v ) / (1 + ( (1/n ) v ) ) 

= (1 + n v ) / (n + v ), since multiplying numerator and denominator by n.

Which is option A.

So the correct answer should be A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic principles. The light beam propagates through a glass medium with an index of refraction \( n \), and the glass itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the beam, toward the observer. The speed of light in the glass relative to the glass's rest frame is \( u = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( c = 1 \) in this problem. 

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

we substitute \( u = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \):

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{1}{n} v}{1}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n (1 + \frac{v}{n})}
\]

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \) matches the derived expression.
- **Option B**: \( 1 \) is incorrect because it does not account for the medium's motion or the refractive index.
- **Option C**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \) is incorrect because the denominator should not be \( n - v \).
- **Option D**: \( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \) is incorrect because the numerator should not involve subtraction.

The correct answer is **Option A**.

Answer: A
