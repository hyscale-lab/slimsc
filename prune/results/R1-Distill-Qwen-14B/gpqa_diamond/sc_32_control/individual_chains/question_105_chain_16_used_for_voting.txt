Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Hmm. Let me read it again carefully.

So, the question is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The setup is that when we observe the star, the brightness variations due to rotation look like an exoplanet transiting. The task is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as these spots.

Wait, the key here is to compare the photometric signal from the spots to that from a planet transit. Because when a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. Similarly, the spots cover part of the star's surface, which changes the observed brightness as the star rotates.

So first, I need to figure out the change in brightness caused by the spots, then compare that to the change caused by a planet transit.

I remember that the change in brightness (the relative flux) is calculated as the area blocked divided by the area of the star. But wait, for a planet transit, yes, it's (Rp/Rstar)^2 because the area is proportional to the square of the radius.

But for the spots, it's a bit different. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, they contribute less to the total brightness. But wait, the star is rotating, so the spots come into and out of view, modulating the light curve.

Wait, the problem states that the effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K. But for the photometric effect, the spots would appear darker, so the flux from that area is lower.

But how does this affect the overall brightness? Let's think in terms of flux. The flux from a star is proportional to the area times the temperature to the fourth power. So for the whole star, the flux is F = sigma * Teff^4. But when part of the star is covered by spots, that part's flux is sigma * T_spot^4.

So the total flux without spots is F_total = sigma * (Teff)^4 * (4 pi Rstar^2), but the actual calculation would be considering each part. But when spots are present, the flux from the spot area is less.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the fractional change in brightness when the spots are present.

Wait, the filling factor is 20%, so 0.2 of one hemisphere. Wait, the star's surface is divided into two hemispheres, and one is entirely covered in spots. Wait, no, no. The problem says 'one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%'. So the entire hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface, but the spots only cover 20% of that hemisphere. So the spots take up 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1, or 10% of the total surface area of the star.

Wait, no. Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that is covered in spots. So if the hemisphere is 50% of the star's area, then the spots cover 20% of that, which is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1, or 10% of the total star's surface.

But wait, perhaps I should think of it as the spots covering 20% of the visible hemisphere when the star is rotating. Hmm, no, the problem says the filling factor is 20%, meaning that the spots cover 20% of the entire hemisphere. Let me clarify.

So the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So its surface area is 4 pi R^2. The hemisphere is 2 pi R^2. So if the filling factor is 0.2, the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this step by step.

The star's surface area is A = 4 pi Rstar². Half of this is one hemisphere, so 2 pi Rstar². The spots cover 20% of this hemisphere, so their area is 0.2 * 2 pi Rstar² = 0.4 pi Rstar².

Each spot has a temperature of 5000 K, and the rest of the star is at 6000 K.

So when the spot is visible (i.e., when that part of the star's surface is facing us), the flux from that area is less than normal.

The question is about the relative change in brightness when the spots are in view. But since the star is rotating, the spots come into and out of view, causing a periodic variation.

But since the problem states that the situation resembles an exoplanet transit, which causes a dip in brightness when it passes in front of the star, we can model the effect of the spots as a similar dip in brightness.

Wait, no. Because the spots are cooler, they contribute less flux. So the dip in brightness when the spots are in the line of sight is due to the lower flux from that part of the star. But when the spots are on the far side, the star's brightness returns to normal.

Wait, no. The star's brightness as seen from Earth varies as the spots rotate into and out of view. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is lower than when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us. So the star's brightness changes as it rotates.

But the problem says that this variation would be similar to that caused by a planet transiting the star. So we need to find the planet radius that would cause a dip of the same amplitude.

Wait, but wait. The transit method measures a dip in brightness equal to (Rp/Rstar)^2, because the planet blocks that fraction of the star's light. But in this case, the spots are causing a dip. So how much dip do the spots cause?

The dip depends on the change in flux due to the spots. Let me model this.

The total flux from the star when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is F = (area_unspotted * Teff^4 + area_spotted * T_spot^4) / (4 pi Rstar^2) * sigma. But wait, actually, the flux is the sum of each part's contribution.

Wait, the star emits flux as F = sigma T^4 per unit area. So the total flux without any spots is F0 = sigma * Teff^4 * (4 pi Rstar^2) / (4 pi) ) = sigma * Teff^4 * Rstar^2.

Wait, no, wait. The total flux is F = sigma * T^4 * A, where A is the area. So for the entire star, F0 = sigma * Teff^4 * 4 pi Rstar^2.

When the spots are visible, the flux is F = (4 pi Rstar^2 - A_spots) * sigma * Teff^4 + A_spots * sigma * T_spot^4.

So F = F0 - A_spots * sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

The fractional change in flux is (F - F0) / F0 = [ - A_spots sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / (sigma Teff^4 4 pi Rstar^2 )

Simplify: (F - F0)/F0 = [ - A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / (4 pi Rstar^2 Teff^4 )

A_spots is the area of the spots, which is 0.4 pi Rstar^2 (as per earlier calculation).

So substituting:

(F-F0)/F0 = [ -0.4 pi Rstar^2 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / (4 pi Rstar^2 (6000^4) )

Simplify the terms:

The Rstar^2 and pi terms cancel out.

So:

= [ -0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / (4 *6000^4 )

= [ -0.4 ( (6^4 -5^4) *10^12 ) ] / (4 *6^4 *10^12 )

Wait, let me compute 6000^4 -5000^4. Let me compute 6^4 and 5^4.

6^4 = 1296; 5^4 = 625.

So 6^4 -5^4 = 1296 -625 = 671.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 671 * (10^3)^4 = 671 * 1e12 = 6.71e14. Hmm, but perhaps I should compute the ratio.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute everything in terms of units relative to Teff.

Let me compute the numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 0.4 * (6000^4 - 5000^4 ) = 0.4 * 671e12 * (1e3)^4.

Wait, perhaps I should keep the numbers in terms of thousands.

Wait, 6000 K = 6 *10^3, 5000=5e3.

Let me compute (6e3)^4 - (5e3)^4 = (6^4 -5^4) * (1e3)^4 = (1296-625) *1e12 = 671 *1e12.

So the numerator is 0.4 *671e12 = 268.4e12.

Denominator is 4 * (6e3)^4 =4 * 1296e12 = 5184e12.

So the fractional change is:

[ -268.4e12 ] / [5184e12 ] = -268.4 / 5184 ≈ -0.0517.

So the fractional change is about -5.17%: meaning the brightness is 5.17% lower when the spots are visible.

Wait, but wait. Actually, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the star is dimmer, so the brightness is lower. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is about 5.17%.

But wait, the problem is that when only one hemisphere is spotty, the spots come into view as the star rotates. So the brightness variation would be modulated as the spots come into and out of view.

But the maximum dip would be when all the spots are visible, right? So the maximum dip is about 5.17% of the star's flux.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F = F0 * [ (A_unspotted T_eff^4 + A_spotted T_spot^4) ] / (A_total T_eff^4 )

Because when the star isn't rotating, the entire star emits at T_eff, so F0 = A_total * sigma T_eff^4.

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the unspotted area is 2 pi R^2 * (1 - 0.2), because the hemisphere is 2 pi R^2 and 20% is covered. Wait, no. Wait, the spotted hemisphere is 20% filled with spots, so the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible and when the non-spotty is visible.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the average flux when the star is viewed from a certain hemisphere.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think: when the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F1. When the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F2.

The average flux would be (F1 + F2)/2, but the variation between them would be the amplitude.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the difference in flux between when the star is spotted and when it's not. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the variation in brightness between the two hemispheres is the difference between F2 (non-spotty hemisphere) and F1 (spotty hemisphere).

Wait, but the star might be rotating such that the spotty hemisphere alternates with the non-spotty. So the maximum brightness occurs when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when the spotty is.

Wait, no, because the spotty hemisphere is cooler, so the flux is lower when it's facing us.

So the maximum flux is when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, and the minimum when the spotty is.

Wait, but the star's surface is a mix of spots and non-spots. So when you look at the star, you see both hemispheres perhaps, depending on the viewing angle.

Wait, no, if the star is rotating, then the hemisphere that's facing us changes over time. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, you see the spots, and when the other hemisphere (non-spotty) is facing us, you don't.

Wait, but each point on the star's surface is at a certain temperature. So if the star has one hemisphere (say, the front) with spots, and the other (back) without spots, then as it rotates, the front and back hemispheres come into view.

Wait, perhaps the star's brightness is modulated as the spotty hemisphere comes into view. So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is lower.

So the maximum dip is when the entire spotted area is blocking as much light as possible. But wait, the spots are part of the hemisphere, so when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute less.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to model the brightness as the sum of the flux from the parts visible.

Wait, let's model the star as having two regions: the spotted hemisphere and the non-spotted hemisphere.

The spotted hemisphere has an area of 2 pi R^2, with 20% of that covered in spots (so 0.4 pi R^2 of spots and 1.6 pi R^2 of normal surface).

The non-spotted hemisphere has an area of 2 pi R^2, all at Teff.

When the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux from the spotted hemisphere is (0.4 pi R^2)*sigma T_spot^4 + (1.6 pi R^2)*sigma T_eff^4.

The flux from the non-spotted hemisphere is 2 pi R^2 * sigma T_eff^4 (but wait, if the other hemisphere isn't spotted, then when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the non-spotted is on the back and not visible. Or is the star a sphere, so only the front hemisphere is visible? Or do we see the entire surface as it rotates? Hmm, I think when a star is viewed edge-on, you see the entire surface, but when face-on, perhaps you only see the front. Wait, no, when a star is face-on, you see the whole surface, but when edge-on, the rotation causes parts to come into view.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think of it this way: when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the light we receive comes from that hemisphere. The other hemisphere (non-spotted) is on the back, so we don't see it.

Wait, no, that's not correct. No, because the star's surface is a sphere, and when viewed from a certain direction, you see the entire surface, but as it rotates, different parts come into view.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as the star being divided into two halves: one with spots (front hemisphere) and the other without (back hemisphere). As the star rotates, the front and back hemispheres come into view.

Wait, but when the front is facing us, the back is not, and vice versa. No, that's not right either. Wait, no, because when the star rotates, we see a different part of its surface.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's surface is divided into two halves, each with a different temperature. One hemisphere has spots (lower T), and the other is normal T.

So when the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, we receive less flux because the spots are cooler. When the other hemisphere is facing us, the flux is higher.

But the average flux would be the sum of the flux from both hemispheres, but wait, no, because each hemisphere is either facing us or not, so during rotation, each part contributes based on visibility.

Wait, perhaps the star's observed flux alternates between the flux from the spotty hemisphere and the non-spotty.

Wait, but that's only if the star is viewed such that we see each hemisphere in turn. But in reality, as a star rotates, parts of both hemispheres come into view, depending on the viewing angle.

Hmm, perhaps the brightness variation is sinusoidal, with a maximum when the non-spotty part is most visible, and a minimum when the spotty part is.

But perhaps a simpler approach is to calculate the maximum dip in brightness that occurs when the entire spotted area is blocking the maximum possible light.

Wait, but the question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation. So the maximum dip in brightness would be when the maximum amount of the star's surface is covered by the spots as seen from Earth. But in this scenario, the entire hemisphere is spotted, but only 20% of the hemisphere is actually spots.

Wait, no, the entire hemisphere is spotted with a filling factor of 20%. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots, and the flux is lower.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is that the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spotted and non-spotted hemispheres come into view. So the brightness variation would be the difference between when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible (maximum brightness) and when the spotty is visible (minimum brightness).

Wait, but the star's surface is a mix of both. Hmm, perhaps when the star is viewed face-on, the entire surface is visible, but as it rotates, different parts come into view. But that's complicating. Alternatively, perhaps the observed brightness is the sum of the fluxes from each hemisphere as they become visible.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the average flux is the sum of the flux from both hemispheres. The flux from the spotty hemisphere is its area multiplied by T_spot^4, and the non-spotty's flux is its area multiplied by T_eff^4.

So the average flux is F_avg = (A_spotted * T_spot^4 + A_non-spotted * T_eff^4) * sigma.

But the maximum and minimum flux would be when one hemisphere is entirely visible.

Wait, perhaps the star's brightness variation depends on which hemisphere is facing us. So when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_non-spotty = (2 pi R^2) * sigma T_eff^4.

When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotty = (2 pi R^2 - A_spots) * sigma Teff^4 + A_spots * sigma T_spot^4.

Wait, but wait, the entire spotty hemisphere is 2 pi R^2, of which 20% is covered in spots. So A_spots is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

So F_spotty = (2 pi R^2 - 0.4 pi R^2) * sigma Teff^4 + 0.4 pi R^2 * sigma T_spot^4.

Simplify:

= (1.6 pi R^2) sigma Teff^4 + (0.4 pi R^2) sigma T_spot^4.

The non-spotty hemisphere's flux is F_non-spotty = 2 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

The difference in flux between F_non-spotty and F_spotty is:

Delta_F = F_non-spotty - F_spotty
= 2 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 - [1.6 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 + 0.4 pi R^2 sigma T_spot^4 ]
= (2 - 1.6) pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 - 0.4 pi R^2 sigma T_spot^4
= 0.4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 - 0.4 pi R^2 sigma T_spot^4
= 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

The fractional change is Delta_F / F_non-spotty = [ 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / (2 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 )

Simplify:

= [0.4 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / (2 Teff^4 )

= [0.2 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / Teff^4

= 0.2 ( 1 - (T_spot / Teff)^4 )

Plug in the numbers: Teff = 6000 K, T_spot =5000 K.

(T_spot / Teff )^4 = (5/6)^4.

Compute 5/6 is approximately 0.8333. 0.8333^4 is approximately:

0.8333^2 = approx 0.6944. Then squared again: 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So:

0.2 (1 - 0.4823) = 0.2 * 0.5177 = 0.10354.

So the fractional change is about 10.354%. But wait, that's the difference when comparing the two hemispheres. So the maximum brightness is F_non-spotty, and the minimum is F_spotty, which is 10.35% less.

Wait, but wait a second! Because the star emits from both hemispheres when viewed from any angle. So perhaps I'm miscalculating. Because when the star rotates, the hemisphere facing us changes, but the other hemisphere is still present. Wait, no, perhaps the brightness depends on whether the spots are on the front or the back.

Wait, maybe I should think of the star as having a certain fraction of its surface covered by spots, regardless of the hemisphere. Because if only one hemisphere is spotty, but when viewed edge-on, you'd see parts of both hemispheres as the star rotates.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots are visible and cause a dip in brightness. The dip's amplitude is 10.35% as calculated. But when the star is viewed such that the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is higher.

But then, the maximum dip would be when the spotty hemisphere is entirely visible. But when the star is observed from an angle, perhaps only part of the spotty hemisphere is visible, leading to a varying dip.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplified by considering that the star's rotation causes the entire spotty hemisphere to come into view, leading to a dip of 10.35% as calculated.

But then, the question is to find the planet radius that would cause the same amplitude in brightness variation. The transit method's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So if the dip from the spots is 10.35%, then the planet would need to cause a dip of 10.35% as well.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035.

Taking the square root: Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

Wait, but wait a minute. Wait, the dip from the spots is 10.35%, so the planet's dip should be the same. So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217, which is approximately 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.32.

But wait, no. Because maybe I made a mistake in calculating the dip.

Wait, let me go back. The dip I calculated was F_non-spotty - F_spotty = 0.1035 F_non-spotty.

But perhaps the average dip is 0.0517 because when the star is viewed from a certain angle, only a fraction of the spots are visible. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the dip as a percentage of the star's total flux, which could be lower if the spots are only on a hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps I should model the brightness without considering which hemisphere is being viewed. Let me think about it differently.

The star has an effective temperature of 6000 K. The spots are cooler, 5000 K, and cover 20% of one hemisphere (so 10% of the entire star's surface area).

So when the star is viewed without any spots, the total flux is F0 = sigma Teff^4 * 4 pi Rstar^2.

But when the spots are present, the flux is F = F0 - (area_spots * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )) * sigma.

The area of the spots is 0.2 * (2 pi Rstar^2) ) = 0.4 pi Rstar^2.

So F = F0 - 0.4 pi Rstar^2 * sigma * (6000^4 -5000^4 )

The fractional change is (F - F0)/F0 = [ -0.4 pi Rstar^2 sigma (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [ sigma Teff^4 4 pi Rstar^2 ) ]

Simplify:

= [ -0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / (4 * 6000^4 )

Compute 6000^4 -5000^4 = (6^4 -5^4) * 1e12 = (1296 -625) *1e12 = 671e12.

So:

= [ -0.4 * 671e12 ] / [4 * 1296e12 ]

= [ -268.4e12 ] / [5184e12 ]

= -268.4 / 5184 ≈ -0.0517, which is -5.17%.

So the dip in brightness is approximately 5.17%.

Wait, that's different from the 10% I previously calculated. So which is correct?

Ah, I think I messed up the earlier approach by considering only the flux from each hemisphere. The correct approach is to compute the total flux change due to the spots covering 10% of the star's surface (20% of a hemisphere, which is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 or 10% of the star's surface area).

The fractional change in flux is (delta F)/F0 = [ - (A_spots) (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / (4 pi Rstar^2 Teff^4 )

Which gives us 5.17% dip.

So now, the dip from the spots is 5.17%.

The dip from a planet transit is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517.

Taking the square root gives Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.227.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. The options are 0.07, 0.11, 0.32, 0.39.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the area of the spots.

Wait, the problem states that the star's radius is equal to the Sun's radius. The filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere.

So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2 pi Rstar²) = 0.4 pi Rstar².

But wait, the star's total surface area is 4 pi Rstar², so 0.4 pi Rstar² is 0.4/(4) = 0.1, or 10% of the star's total surface.

So the delta F is 0.4 pi Rstar² * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) sigma / (4 pi Rstar^2 sigma Teff^4 )

= (0.4 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )) / (4 Teff^4 )

= (0.4/4) (1 - (T_spot/Teff)^4 )

= 0.1 (1 - (5/6)^4 )

As before, (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

0.1 * 0.5177 = 0.05177, so delta F/F0 = 5.177%.

So the dip is about 5.18%.

Then, for the planet, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2276.

Hmm, that's about 0.228, but that's not one of the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B is ~0.07, option C is ~0.11, D is ~0.32, which is about 0.32.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in considering whether the spots are on one hemisphere and how that affects the observed flux. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the observed dip is not 5.17% but something else. Because when the star is viewed edge-on, you see both hemispheres, but as it rotates, the spots come into and out of view. So the average dip would be the same as when the entire spotted hemisphere is viewed.

Wait, perhaps the dip amplitude is half of what I thought. Because when the star is at a certain angle, only part of the spotty hemisphere is visible.

Wait, no. The problem states that the star's one hemisphere is covered in spots, and as it rotates, the spots come into view, making the brightness vary. So when the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is fully visible, the dip is maximal.

But perhaps the amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between when the star is at maximum brightness (non-spotty hemisphere) and when the spotty is visible. So the amplitude is 5.17% of F0.

But the options don't have a value close to 0.228. So perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the flux when the spots are only partially visible. For example, when the star is viewed edge-on, the entire surface is visible, and the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere, which is 10% of the total area. So the dip would be 5.17%, as before.

But the planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517, so Rp/Rstar is about 0.227.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area. Let me recheck.

The filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (area of hemisphere).

Hemisphere area is 2 pi R^2.

So spots area is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

Total star area is 4 pi R^2.

So the fraction of the star's area covered by spots is 0.4 pi R^2 / 4 pi R^2 = 0.1, so 10%.

So the dip is 10% of the star's area, each spot area contributing (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4) per unit area.

So the dip is:

delta F = (A_spots) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) * sigma / (4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 )

= (0.4 pi R^2) (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / (4 pi R^2 6000^4 )

= 0.4 * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / (4 *6000^4 )

= 0.4 * (671e12) / (4 * 1296e12) )

= 0.4 * 671 / 4 * 1296.

Wait, 671/1296 is approximately 0.5177.

So 0.4 *0.5177 /4 = (0.20708)/4 = 0.05177, so 5.177%.

So the dip is 5.177% of the star's flux.

So the planet's radius must produce a (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2276.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Hmm. 0.227 is between 0.11 and 0.32. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation caused by the spots as a function of the spot coverage and the temperature difference, but the planet's effect is a simple occultation, which is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the radius of the planet that would cause the same change in brightness as the spots, which is 5.177%.

So Rp^2 = 0.05177 Rstar^2.

Rp = 0.2276 Rstar.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation as the difference between when the spots are in front and when they're behind, which would be twice the dip I calculated, but that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the amplitude as the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness, which would be 5.177% as the dip.

Wait, perhaps another approach: think about the brightness change when the spots are on the visible hemisphere.

The star's total luminosity without spots is L0 = 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

With spots covering 10% of the surface, the luminosity is L = L0 - 0.1 L0 * (1 - (T_spot / Teff)^4 )

= L0 * [ 1 - 0.1 (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ]

Which is what I calculated earlier, leading to a 5.177% dip.

So the amplitude is 5.177%, which is the dip.

So the planet's amplitude must be the same, so (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

So Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2276.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem is that the star's rotation causes the spots to appear only when a certain part is facing us, leading to a different calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that only one hemisphere is spotty, so the maximum dip is when the entire spotty hemisphere is visible, meaning that the area is 2 pi R^2 * 0.2.

Wait, then the area is 0.4 pi R^2, but when the entire hemisphere is facing us, the area contributing to the dip is 0.4 pi R^2.

But then, the dip would be:

delta F = (0.4 pi R^2) (6000^4 -5000^4) / (4 pi R^2 6000^4 )

= 0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4) / (4 * 6000^4 )

= 0.4 * 671e12 / (4 *1296e12 )

= (0.4 * 671) / (4 * 1296 )

= 268.4 / 5184 ≈ 0.05177, same as before.

So same result.

Hmm. Since none of the options match 0.227, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about the dip in brightness but about the overall variation, considering the rotational modulation. Maybe the amplitude is calculated differently.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the brightness variation is due to the spots rotating in and out of view, which could create a periodic brightness change with a certain amplitude. The amplitude of this variation could be the same as that caused by a planet transit.

But the dip from the spots is 5.17%, which is the same as the planet's dip. So the planet's radius is sqrt(0.0517) Rstar, which is ~0.227 Rstar, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the spot area. Let me recheck.

The problem says the star's radius equals the Sun's. The filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2 pi R^2) = 0.4 pi R^2.

So the area fraction is 0.4 pi R^2 / (4 pi R^2) ) = 0.1, or 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, so the calculation is correct, leading to a dip of 5.17%.

So the planet's radius would need to be sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.227 Rstar.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the dip but the variation in brightness when the star rotates. The star's brightness would vary as the spots come into and out of view, causing a periodic signal. The amplitude of this signal is the same as that caused by a planet.

Wait, perhaps the variation in brightness is due to the spots being on one hemisphere, leading to a maximum when the spotty hemisphere is facing us. So the brightness variation is from F_non-spotty to F_spotty.

The dip is the difference between F_non-spotty and F_spotty, which is 10.35% of F_non-spotty, as calculated earlier.

Wait, so earlier when I considered the two hemispheres, the dip was 10.35%.

So if that's the case, then (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.3217, which matches option D) ~0.32.

Ah, yes! I think I see where I went wrong earlier. The initial approach considered the star's entire surface and the 10% spots, leading to a 5.17% dip. But perhaps the problem is considering that when the star's spotty hemisphere is fully visible, the dip is 10.35%, which would correspond to a planet of radius 0.32.

So let me recalculate that.

When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F_spotty = (0.8 * 2 pi R^2) * sigma Teff^4 + (0.2 * 2 pi R^2) * sigma T_spot^4.

Because the spotted hemisphere is 20% covered with spots, so 80% is normal.

So F_spotty = (1.6 pi R^2) sigma Teff^4 + (0.4 pi R^2) sigma T_spot^4.

The non-spotty hemisphere's flux is F_non-spotty = 2 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

The difference is F_non-spotty - F_spotty = 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

Divided by F_non-spotty, the fractional change is [ 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / (2 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 )

= 0.4 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / (2 Teff^4 )

= 0.2 (1 - (5/6)^4 )

As before, (5/6)^4 is approximately 0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

So 0.2 * 0.5177 = 0.1035, which is a 10.35% dip.

So the dip is 10.35% when the spotty hemisphere is facing us.

So the planet must cause the same dip of 10.35%, so (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

Which is approximately 0.32, matching option D.

So the correct answer is D) ~0.32.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve as the observed brightness variation caused by the spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Same as the Sun, \( R_{\text{star}} \).
   - Effective Temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a **filling factor of 20%**.
   - Spots Temperature: \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Spot Area**:
   - The total surface area of the star is \( 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - One hemisphere has an area of \( 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - The spots cover 20% of this hemisphere, so the area of the spots is:
     \[
     A_{\text{spots}} = 0.2 \times 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2.
     \]
   - The fraction of the star's total surface area covered by spots is:
     \[
     \frac{A_{\text{spots}}}{4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2} = \frac{0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2}{4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2} = 0.1 \, \text{(10% of the star's surface)}.
     \]

3. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The flux from a star is proportional to the area and the fourth power of the temperature:
     \[
     F \propto A T^4.
     \]
   - The total flux without spots is:
     \[
     F_0 = 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4.
     \]
   - When the spots are visible, the flux is reduced. The fractional change in flux is:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{A_{\text{spots}} (\sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 - \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4)}{4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4}.
     \]
   - Substituting \( A_{\text{spots}} = 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \):
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 (6000^4 - 5000^4)}{4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 6000^4}.
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{0.4 (6000^4 - 5000^4)}{4 \times 6000^4}.
     \]
   - Compute \( 6000^4 - 5000^4 \):
     \[
     6000^4 = 1296 \times 10^{12}, \quad 5000^4 = 625 \times 10^{12}, \quad \text{so } 6000^4 - 5000^4 = 671 \times 10^{12}.
     \]
   - Substitute:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{0.4 \times 671 \times 10^{12}}{4 \times 1296 \times 10^{12}} = \frac{268.4}{5184} \approx 0.05177 \, \text{(5.17% dip)}.
     \]

4. **Exoplanet Signal**:
   - The brightness variation caused by a planet transit is:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2.
     \]
   - To match the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots (5.17%), set:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.05177.
     \]
   - Solve for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.05177} \approx 0.227.
     \]

5. **Revisiting the Amplitude**:
   - The problem states that the brightness variation resembles the rotational modulation of spots. When the spotty hemisphere is fully visible, the dip is larger. The flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotty}} = (0.8 \times 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2) \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 + (0.2 \times 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2) \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4.
     \]
   - The flux when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible is:
     \[
     F_{\text{non-spotty}} = 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4.
     \]
   - The difference in flux is:
     \[
     \Delta F = F_{\text{non-spotty}} - F_{\text{spotty}} = 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4).
     \]
   - The fractional change is:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{non-spotty}}} = \frac{0.4 (T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4)}{2 T_{\text{eff}}^4}.
     \]
   - Substituting \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \):
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{non-spotty}}} = \frac{0.4 (6000^4 - 5000^4)}{2 \times 6000^4} = 0.2 (1 - (5/6)^4).
     \]
   - Compute \( (5/6)^4 \approx 0.4823 \):
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{non-spotty}}} = 0.2 (1 - 0.4823) = 0.2 \times 0.5177 = 0.1035 \, \text{(10.35% dip)}.
     \]
   - To match this amplitude, set:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1035.
     \]
   - Solve for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3217 \, \text{(approximately 0.32)}.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately **0.32**. This matches **option D**.
