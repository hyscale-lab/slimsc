Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find which energy difference option allows us to clearly distinguish between the two levels.

Hmm, right. I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state relates to the uncertainty in energy. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle comes into play here. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

So, the formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. But wait, in practice, people often just use ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt) as an estimate for the uncertainty in energy. Since the lifetimes here are the Δt, I can use that to find the minimum energy difference needed for the levels to be distinguishable.

Wait, but the lifetimes given are for each state. Or wait, no, actually, when you have a state with a certain lifetime, the uncertainty in its energy is inversely proportional to that lifetime. So a shorter lifetime (like 1e-9 s) means higher uncertainty in energy, right? Because if a state doesn't last long, we can't measure its energy very precisely.

So, to clearly distinguish between E1 and E2, their energy difference must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Or wait, maybe each has their own uncertainty, so the energy difference should be bigger than each individual uncertainty? Or maybe the maximum of the two? Hmm.

Wait, no, I think the correct approach is that the energy difference ΔE must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for either state. Because if ΔE is much larger than the uncertainties, then the two levels can be resolved. But if ΔE is smaller than the uncertainty, then the lines would overlap, and you can't distinguish them.

So let me calculate the uncertainties for each state.

The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

But wait, the options are given in eV, so I'll need to convert the energy uncertainty into eV.

The energy uncertainty ΔE is approximately ħ / (2Δt).

So for E1, Δt1 is 1e-9 seconds:

ΔE1 = ħ / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2e-9 s) )

Calculating that:

1.0545718e-34 divided by 2e-9 is 5.272859e-26 J.

Convert that to eV. Since 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J.

So ΔE1 = (5.272859e-26 J) / (1.60218e-19 J/eV) ≈ 3.29e-7 eV. So about 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, for E2, Δt2 is 1e-8 seconds:

ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * 1e-8) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-8) = 5.272859e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.272859e-27 / 1.60218e-19 = approximately 3.29e-8 eV.

So the uncertainties are 3.29e-7 eV for E1 and 3.29e-8 eV for E2.

Wait, but which one matters here? Because to distinguish E1 and E2, their energy difference must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, I think. Because if the difference is smaller than the sum, the two states might overlap in their energy ranges, making them indistinguishable.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think of it as the energy difference needs to be greater than each individual uncertainty. Because if ΔE is bigger than the larger of the two uncertainties, then it's definitely larger than both. Alternatively, if the energy difference is bigger than the sum, perhaps that's even more certain.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that for each state, the energy isn't precisely known—if the state's lifetime is short, the energy is uncertain. So when you have two states, their energies have uncertainties. The minimum energy difference between the two should be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties for them to be resolvable.

Or maybe, just the maximum uncertainty between the two? Because the state with the longer lifetime (E2, 1e-8 s) has a lower energy uncertainty, so the dominant uncertainty comes from the shorter-lived state (E1). So the required ΔE between E1 and E2 should be larger than the uncertainty of the shorter-lived state. Because that's the larger uncertainty.

Wait, let's think about this: if E1 has a larger uncertainty (3.29e-7 eV) and E2 has a smaller (3.29e-8 eV), then for the two energies to be distinct, they need to be separated by more than the larger uncertainty. Because if their separation is less than the larger uncertainty, then E1 and E2 could overlap within the uncertainty of the higher one. So the required ΔE should be larger than 3.29e-7 eV.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are 1e-9, 1e-11, 1e-4, 1e-8 eV.

So 3.29e-7 eV is about 3e-7 eV, which is larger than all the options except C (1e-4 eV). So the only option that's larger than 3e-7 is C, which is 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in calculating ΔE. Because the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt), but I might have messed up the exponents.

Let me recalculate ΔE1 for E1.

Δt = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = ħ / (2Δt) = (1.05457e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = 1.05457e-34 / 2e-9 = 5.27285e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So,

5.27285e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = 5.27285e-26 / 1.602e-19 = approximately 3.29e-7 eV.

Yes, that's correct.

Similarly, for Δt = 1e-8 s (E2), ΔE2 = ħ/(2*1e-8) = 1.05457e-34 / 2e-8 = 5.27285e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.27285e-27 / 1.602e-19 = 3.29e-8 eV.

So, the energy uncertainties are 3.29e-7 eV and 3.29e-8 eV for E1 and E2 respectively.

Now, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So the difference ΔE = E2 - E1 (assuming E2 is higher, which it probably is since the lifetime is longer, but not necessarily. Wait, longer lifetime implies lower energy uncertainty, but not necessarily higher energy. Hmm, but the actual energy levels could be either way, but for the purpose of distinguishing, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for either state, or the sum? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach. The energy levels can be considered as having a certain uncertainty (ΔE1 and ΔE2, as above). The energy levels should not overlap, so the separation between them should be more than the sum of the uncertainties. Because if the separation is less than the sum, the two levels could overlap, making it impossible to distinguish them.

So, the minimum energy difference required is (ΔE1 + ΔE2). Let me calculate that.

ΔE1 = 3.29e-7 eV, ΔE2 = 3.29e-8 eV.

Sum is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV.

Wait, but the options don't have such a value. The closest option is C) 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 3.6e-7. Alternatively, perhaps I was wrong about adding them. Maybe we just take the larger uncertainty, as that's the dominant one.

Because if the energy difference is larger than the larger uncertainty (3.29e-7 eV), then it's definitely larger than the sum as well. Because the sum would be 3.6e-7, which is a bit more than 3.29e-7. So if the difference is larger than 3.29e-7, the sum is about the same ballpark.

Wait, but looking at the options, the only option larger than 3.29e-7 is C) 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 is 1e-4 = 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. Which is way larger than 3.29e-7 eV, which is about 0.000000329 eV.

So if the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, which is about 300 times larger than the sum of the uncertainties, then yes, they can be distinguished.

Now, looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.000000001 eV → way too small.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → much larger than the required 3.6e-7 eV.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV → smaller than the required 3.29e-7 eV.

Wait, because 3.29e-7 eV is larger than 1e-8 (which is 0.00000001), so D is 0.00000001, which is smaller than 0.000000329. So D is too small.

So the only option that is larger than the required 3.29e-7 eV is C.

Therefore, the correct answer is C.

To distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), their energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than the uncertainties in their respective energies. The uncertainty in energy for each state is determined by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t},
\]

where \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). Converting the result to electron volts (1 eV = \( 1.60218 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)), the energy uncertainties for the two states are calculated as follows:

1. For \( E_1 \) with \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 5.272859 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to eV:
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{5.272859 \times 10^{-26}}{1.60218 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For \( E_2 \) with \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 5.272859 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to eV:
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{5.272859 \times 10^{-27}}{1.60218 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

To distinguish the two states, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, evaluating the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** This is \( 0.000000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** This is \( 0.00000000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is even smaller. Not sufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** This is \( 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **C**.
