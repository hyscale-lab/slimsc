Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question lists four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are combinations of these four. I remember that optical isomerism, also known as enantiomerism, occurs when a compound has a chiral center — a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. So, the presence of a chiral center is key here.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are nitro groups on the 6 position and carboxylate groups on the 2 position on each ring. Wait, but the main thing is the structure. Since it's a biphenyl, the two phenyl rings are connected. But is there a chiral center here? The substituents are symmetrical perhaps? Let me visualize: if each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group, but their positions are such that maybe each substituent is in a specific position. Wait, the formula is dimethyl, so the ester groups are on each phenyl. For each ring, the positions are 2 and 6. So, each ring has two substituents. Now, considering the structure, does it have a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are opposite each other, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. Alternatively, if the arrangement around the central bond allows for a plane of symmetry, then there might not be a chiral center. Wait, but if the substituents are in such a way that each phenyl group is identical, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center. Wait, but I'm not sure. Another thought: sometimes, if a molecule has a central axis with identical groups on both sides, it might not be chiral. So in this case, each ring has two substituents, but are they arranged symmetrically? If the substituents on each ring are in the same positions relative to the central bond, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. Or perhaps each substituent is on the same side? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should come back to this one after looking at the others.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break this down. The structure is an ester: the acid part is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the formula would be CH3COOCH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3CH(OH)COO-, but as an ester, it would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: so the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the acid is propanoic acid with a hydroxyl group on the second carbon. So the structure would be O
       |
O-CO-OCH3
       |
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? No, maybe I should draw it. The ester is R-O-CO-R', where R is methyl, and R' is the propionic acid part with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So R' is CH2CH(OH)CH3. So the ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is O
     |
O-CO-OCH3 connected to a CH2-CH(OH)-CH3 group. Now, looking at the chiral centers. The central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is attached to what? Let's see: the carbon is CH(OH), attached to two CH2 groups. Wait, no. Wait, let's number the carbons. The ester part is O-CO-OCH3, so the R' is CH2CH(OH)CH3. Wait, the structure is CH3-O-CO-O-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? No, no. Wait, no, the ester is O-CO-O, with the O attached to the methyl (R-O-) and the COO attached to the R' group, which is 2-hydroxypropane. So R' is CH2CH(OH)CH3. Wait, that is, the R' is CH2CH(OH)CH3. So, the R' is a three-carbon chain: the middle carbon (second) has the hydroxyl. So the structure around that carbon is: hydroxyl, two CH2 groups, and the ester group? Let me think again. The carbons are: the middle carbon is connected to a hydroxyl, a CH3 (from CH2CH(OH)CH3), a CH2 group from the ester COO, and another CH2. Wait, no. Let me think of the structure. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Oh wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then, as an ester, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3O-CO-CH2CH(OH)CH3? No, wait. Wait, the propanoate is CH2CH(OH)COO- attached to methyl. So the structure would be O
         |
O-CO-OCH3
         |
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, but that would make the central carbon (the one with OH) connected to: CH2 (from methyl ester?), no. Wait, maybe the structure is:

The ester is O-CO-O, with the left O connected to methyl and the right O connected to CH2CH(OH)CH3. So the carbonyl is connected to the ester oxygen and to the R' group, which is CH2CH(OH)CH3.

So the R' group is CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So that's a three-carbon chain: the first carbon is connected to the carbonyl, the second has the OH, and the third is CH3.

Wait, that would make the second carbon (the one with OH) connected to:

- One CH2 group (from the first carbon, which is attached to the carbonyl),

- One OH,

- One CH3 (third carbon),

- And one CH2 group (from the first carbon on the other side? Or wait, maybe it's CH2-CH(OH)-CH3, which is a three-carbon chain. So the second carbon is connected to:

- The carbonyl group (from the ester),

- Two CH2 groups (actually, wait, no. Let's number them. The carbonyl is at position 1. Then position 2 is CH2, position 3 is CH(OH), position 4? No, wait, no. Wait, the R' group is CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So that's three carbons: positions 1 (attached to COO), 2 (OH), 3 (CH3). So carbon 2 is attached to:

- Carbon 1: CH2,

- Carbon 3: CH3,

- OH,

- And the hydrogen. Wait, no, in the structure, carbon 2 would have bonds to:

- Carbon 1: which is a CH2 connected to the COO group,

- Carbon 3: a CH3,

- OH,

- And a hydrogen? No, wait, no. Let's see: the structure is CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So carbon 2 is CH(OH), connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH2,

- Carbon 3: CH3,

- OH,

- And another hydrogen? Or is it CH2-CH(OH)-CH3, which would mean carbon 2 has two CH2 groups? No. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the structure. Let me write it correctly.

The R' group is 2-hydroxypropanoate: so the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COO-? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. If the hydroxyl is on the second carbon, then it's CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: so the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2CH(OH)CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of the propanoate. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- A hydroxyl group (-OH),

- Two CH2 groups (from C1 and C3),

- And the carbonyl group (from COOCH3). Wait, no, the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the carbon with OH is attached to:

- CH2-,

- CH2COOCH3,

- OH,

- And another CH2? Or wait, no, each carbon in the chain is connected in a row. So the structure is:

CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? No, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of it another way. The compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the ester is formed from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. The structure would be:

The carboxylic acid part is CH2CH(OH)COOH (if it's propanoic acid with OH on C2). Wait, no: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. If the OH is on the second carbon, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the C2) is attached to:

- An OH,

- A CH2- group (from the CH2 on the left),

- A CH2COOCH3 group (from the right),

- And a hydrogen? Or no, wait, the structure is:

COOCH3 is attached to the CH2-CH(OH)-CH2- group? I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think of the actual structure. The molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 (the ester group),
attached to a CH2-CH(OH)-CH3 group.

So the COOCH3 is connected to the CH2 group, which is connected to the CH(OH) group, which is connected to CH3. So the carbon in the middle (the CH(OH)) is attached to:

- One CH2 group (from the COOCH3 side),

- One CH3 (from the end),

- One OH,

- And another CH2 (from the other side?), but wait, maybe I'm double-counting. Alternatively, the CH(OH) is connected to:

- COOCH3 via a CH2,

- A CH3,

- An OH,

- And another CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the two CH2 groups are adjacent, with OH on the first. So the central carbon is the one with OH, but that's the first CH2. Wait, then the C connected to OH is CH2, so that's two CH2 groups, which would have two identical substituents. So that carbon can't be a chiral center because it's connected to two CH2 groups. Hmm, but wait, the OH is on the second carbon. Oh wait, no, in 2-hydroxypropanoate, the OH is on the second carbon of the three-carbon chain. So the structure is:

CH2-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, but that can't be right because the propanoate would be three carbons. So the structure is: 

COOCH3 is attached to the first carbon, then the second carbon has the OH, and the third is a CH3.

So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH(OH)-CH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- COOCH3 via a CH2,

- CH3,

- OH,

And another CH2? No, I'm getting myself confused. Let me number the carbons from the COOCH3 end:

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: connected to carbon 1, has a hydroxyl and a CH3.

Wait, no, the structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, maybe it's:

The ester is O-CO-OCH3 connected to a three-carbon chain. The chain is CH2-CH(OH)-CH3, but attached where? The first carbon is attached to the COOCH3 group. So the structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

So the four groups attached to the second carbon (the one with OH) are:

- CH2COOCH3,

- CH3,

- OH,

- and a hydrogen. Wait, no, wait: each carbon in a chain is tetrahedral. So the second carbon is attached to:

- The first carbon (which is CH2 connected to COOCH3),

- The third carbon (CH3),

- OH,

- and maybe a hydrogen? Or is it attached to another CH2 group? No, because in the chain, it's CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So the middle carbon (CH(OH)) has:

- Two CH2 groups (on either side),

- An OH,

- And a CH3?

Wait, no, that can't be right. The middle carbon is attached to:

- The first CH2 (from the left),

- The third CH3 (from the right),

- OH,

- And a hydrogen. Because the chain is CH2-CH(OH)-CH3, the middle carbon has four bonds: two CH2 (no, actually, each CH2 is a single bond, so the middle C is connected to:

- One CH2 (left),

- One CH3 (right),

- One OH,

- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So the middle carbon:

- Has two CH2 groups? No, because the left is CH2 (from COOCH3), and the right is CH3. So the middle carbon is CH(OH), connected to:

- CH2 (left),

- CH3 (right),

- OH,

- and a hydrogen? Or maybe another CH2?

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me approach this differently. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different groups attached. If the second carbon in 2-hydroxypropanoate has four different groups, then it's chiral, leading to optical isomerism.

So the second carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- A CH2 group (from the left, connected to the COOCH3),

- A CH3 group (from the right),

- An OH group,

- And a hydrogen.

Wait, that would make four different groups. So the four substituents are: CH2COOCH3, CH3, OH, and H. So that is four distinct groups. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center. So compound 2 does show optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. So two benzene rings connected to a ketone group. The structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers? The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, which means it's a carbonyl group. So it's sp2 hybridized, not sp3. Therefore, it can't be a chiral center because it's trigonal planar. Also, the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the carbonyl group, making it achiral. So benzophenone doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Fumaric acid has a trans configuration in the double bond. The structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH but wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So the structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is (Z), and fumaric acid is (E). So the structure is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, with the double bond in the trans configuration. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester: (CH3O)2C-CH=CH-CO(O)OCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, but the double bond is between the two middle carbons. So when made into the dimethyl ester, it becomes MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me. So the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait, no, the double bond is between the two CH groups. Wait, the structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. So the molecule has a double bond with substituents on either side. Now, for geometric isomerism, but we are considering optical isomerism here. Does this structure have any chiral centers?

Wait, the molecule has two ester groups on either end, but the central double bond is between the two CH groups. Each of these CH groups is attached to an ester group (OOCMe) and a hydrogen. So each of the two carbons in the double bond is connected to:

- An ester group,

- A hydrogen,

- And two other groups (the other carbon in the double bond and perhaps a methyl group? No, wait, no. Wait, each carbon in the double bond is connected to:

- One ester group,

- One hydrogen,

- And two CH groups from the double bond.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 attached to two CH groups connected by a double bond.

Wait, no, it's O
        ||
O-C-OCH3-CH=CH-C-O-C-OCH3. Hmm, no, wait. The structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, so dimethyl fumarate would be (E)-dimethylbut-2-enedioate. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3, but with a double bond. No, wait, no. It's CH2=CH connected to two COOCH3 groups.

Wait, no, the correct structure is CH2=CH with each CH connected to a COOCH3. So each of the carbons in the double bond has:

- One COOCH3 group,

- A double bond to the other carbon,

- And two H's.

So each carbon is CH, so each has a double bond, and two H's.

Wait, so each of these carbons is bonded to:

- COOCH3,

- Double bond to another CH,

- Two H's.

So each carbon is CH2? No, wait, in a double bond, each carbon is bonded to two other atoms. So in CH2=CH, each carbon is connected to two H's and two other carbons (the double bond). But in the case of fumarate, each of the two CH groups is attached to a COOCH3 and a COOCH3 on the other end? No, wait, the double bond is between the two CH groups, each attached to a COOCH3.

So structure is:

MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. So the two central carbons are double-bonded. Each of them is attached to:

- One COOCH3 group,

- One CH,

- And two H's.

Wait, no. Each is attached to one COOCH3, one H, and the double bond to the other CH.

Wait, no, perhaps each is attached to:

- COOCH3,

- H,

- H,

And double bond to the other.

So each carbon in the double bond has two H's, a COOCH3, and a double bond. So each is CH2, but in a double bond, it's actually CH2 in a double bond? Wait, no, each would be CH2 if they have two H's, but with a double bond, they can't have two H's each.

Wait, the structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Each CH is attached to:

- COOCH3,

- H,

- H,

And double bond. So each of the two CH groups in the double bond has two H's. That would mean each has three substituents: COOCH3, two H's, and the double bond. Wait, that can't be, because each CH can't have four bonds.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Each carbon in the double bond (like in but-2-ene) is connected to two other carbons and two H's. So in the case of dimethyl fumarate, each of these CH's is connected to a COOCH3 group.

So the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3)

Wait, no, that would be if each CH is connected to a COOCH3. So each of the two CH groups in the double bond has a COOCH3. So each has:

- Two H's,

- One COOCH3,

- And a double bond to the other CH.

So each of these carbons is CH, not CH2, because they have one COOCH3, one H, and two bonds in the double bond. Wait, no, each carbon in the double bond (like in CH2=CH2) has two CH2 groups. But in this case, each is connected to a COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps each of the two CH groups in the double bond has:

- One COOCH3,

- One H,

- And two bonds in the double bond.

So each carbon is attached to:

- COOCH3,

- H,

- and two CH groups via double bond. Wait, no, each is bonded to the other. So each is connected to the COOCH3, a H, and double bonded to the other CH.

Wait, but that would mean each carbon has three substituents: COOCH3, H, and the double bond. Hmm, but in reality, each carbon in the double bond is connected to two other carbons, but in this case, each is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH via the double bond. Oh wait, perhaps each of the two CH groups is bonded to COOCH3 and another CH via a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I should imagine the structure as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 is attached to a CH, which is double-bonded to another CH, which is attached to another O-C-OCH3. So each CH has:

- One O-C-OCH3,

- One H,

- And double bond to the other CH.

So each CH has three substituents: O-C-OCH3, H, and the double bond (which is two substituents, but in a double bond, each bond is a substituent). So each CH has two substituents from the double bond, plus the O-C-OCH3 and H. Wait, that makes four bonds: COOCH3, H, and two from the double bond. So each is attached to COOCH3, H, and two bonds to the adjacent CH. So each is CH, with two substituents: COOCH3 and H, and two bonds in the double bond.

In that case, each of these two CH groups is attached to two H's? No, because if each has one H and one COOCH3, and the double bond, that's three substituents. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, each CH is bonded to:

- One COOCH3,

- One H,

- And two bonds to the other CH.

Ah, that makes four bonds in total. So each CH has:

- COOCH3,

- H,

- Two bonds to the other CH (so each CH is bonded to the other CH via a double bond).

In that case, each CH is bonded to three groups: COOCH3, H, and the other CH (as part of the double bond). So each has three substituents. But wait, that can't be. A carbon must have four bonds. So perhaps each CH is bonded to COOCH3, H, and two CH groups via single bonds? No, because it's a double bond. Hmm, perhaps each of the two CH groups in the double bond is bonded to a COOCH3, a H, and the other CH via double bonds. That would account for four bonds each.

If that's the case, then each of the two carbons in the double bond has two substituents: COOCH3 and H, along with the double bond. But then each would have only two substituents, which doesn't make sense because each carbon needs four bonds.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck again. Let me think differently. Does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? Fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CO(O)OCH3? No, no, it's O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO(OCH3). So each of the two central carbons is attached to a carbonyl group (O=C-OCH3), a CH group, and a hydrogen.

Wait, no. The structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe. Each CH is attached to a COOCH3 group and has a double bond to the other CH. So each CH has:

- One COOCH3,

- One H (since each CH is CH),

- And two bonds to the other CH via the double bond.

So each CH has three substituents: COOCH3, H, and the double bond. Wait, that would mean each has three, but they need four. I'm getting myself confused again. Perhaps another approach: does dimethyl fumarate have any stereogenic centers?

Actually, the molecule has a double bond with geometric isomerism (cis or trans), but that's not related to optical isomerism. For optical isomerism, you need a chiral center. So if any of the atoms in the molecule has four different groups attached, it would be chiral.

In dimethyl fumarate, looking at the two central carbons (each in the double bond), each is attached to:

- COOCH3,

- H,

- and two CH groups connected by double bonds.

Wait, but in a double bond, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons. So each CH in the double bond is connected to:

- COOCH3,

- H,

- and two bonds to the adjacent CH.

Wait, so each CH has substituents: COOCH3, H, and two CH groups (but that's the same group, so it's not four different groups). So no chiral centers here.

Hmm. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, right? Or does it?

Wait, another thought: maybe the substituents on each end are different. Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, each end is a COOCH3 group. So the two substituents on each CH are the same. So each CH has:

- COOCH3,

- H,

- and two bonds to the same group (another CH with COOCH3 and H). So no, each CH isn't bonded to four different groups. So the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. If the substituents on either side of the double bond are different, but in this case, they're the same (both COOCH3). So no, no chiral centers.

Wait, but wait a second. If the two ester groups are on the same side of the double bond, would that create a plane of symmetry? Or perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, so even if the substituents are same, no chiral centers.

So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain. Let me think again. The structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Each CH in the double bond is attached to:

- COOCH3,

- H,

- and two bonds to the other CH.

So each CH has substituents:

- COOCH3,

- H,

- CH,

- and another CH? No, because each is bonded to the same group on either side.

I think I'm confident now that dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Going back to the first compound:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Biphenyl structures can sometimes have axial chirality. Wait, axial chirality is when the molecule has a chirality due to the arrangement around a single bond, like in biphenyls.

In a biphenyl system, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that they are not symmetrical, then the molecule can have axial chirality, leading to enantiomers.

In this case, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. So each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2.

Wait, the substituents are 6-nitro and 2-carboxylate on each ring.

But let me imagine the structure. Each ring is connected by a single bond. Let's place the two rings such that one is on top and the other is attached below. Each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. So, on each ring, the substituents are at the 2 and 6 positions, which are para to each other.

Wait, no, 2 and 6 are adjacent to each other on the ring. Wait, no, in a benzene ring, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent. So each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2.

Wait, but if each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, and the rings are connected at position 1 and 1', then the arrangement could lead to axial chirality.

Let me consider the substituents. Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. So looking at one ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which are adjacent. So on each ring, two substituents are next to each other.

When the two rings are connected, the arrangement around the central bond can lead to different configurations. If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then the molecule can be chiral.

In this compound, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So each ring has two substituents on adjacent positions. When connected to another ring, the substituents can be arranged such that they are either both on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans), leading to different stereoisomers.

But wait, for axial chirality, the substituents on each ring must be different. In this case, each ring has the same substituents: a nitro and a carboxylate. So each ring has two substituents which are the same as the other ring's substituents. So maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, but wait. The substituents on each ring are same: nitro and carboxylate, but their positions are 2 and 6. So each ring has two substituents that are mirror images of each other. So when you connect two such rings, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical.

Alternatively, maybe the arrangement around the central bond leads to a chiral axis, making the molecule chiral.

I'm a bit stuck on this. Let me think of a similar structure. Biphenyl compounds with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring are often used in the context of atropisomerism, which is axial chirality. If the substituents are in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it can exhibit axial chirality.

In this case, each substituent on the ring is a nitro and a carboxylate group. Since nitro and carboxylate are different groups, but each ring has the same substituents, the arrangement could lead to axial chirality. Because the substituents are in positions 2 and 6, which are adjacent, it's possible that the two rings can adopt different configurations around the central bond, leading to enantiomers.

Wait, but if the substituents on each ring are the same, then when you rotate the rings, the arrangement might not lead to a chiral structure. Because flipping the molecule could make it superimposable on its mirror image.

Alternatively, if the substituents on each ring are different, then the molecule can have axial chirality. But in this case, they're the same. So perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

Wait, but each ring has two substituents: one nitro and one carboxylate. So each ring is asymmetrical. The two rings are connected at position 1 and 1'. So the substituents on each ring are in positions 2 and 6, which are adjacent. So when looking down the central bond, the substituents are arranged in a way that could lead to two different enantiomers.

Wait, perhaps each substituent on one ring is opposite that of the other ring, leading to a symmetrical structure. So, the nitro on one ring is opposite the nitro on the other ring, and the same for the carboxylate. That would lead to a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged such that they are on the same side, then the molecule would lack a plane of symmetry and be chiral.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule have a plane of symmetry, then it's achiral.

In this case, if the nitro groups are on the same side and the carboxylates are on the same side, then perhaps there's a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if they are on opposite sides, the molecule would be chiral.

Wait, but I'm not confident about this. Let me think of another example. For example, 1,1'-biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring.

If the substituents are all the same type on each ring, then the molecule might be symmetrical. But if each ring has different substituents in the same positions, then it's more likely to be chiral.

Alternatively, the arrangement could lead to no plane of symmetry. So in this case, since each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate, which are different groups, the molecule might be chiral.

Wait, but each ring has the same substituents. So the arrangement could have a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral.

Hmm, I'm really not certain about this one. But I think that if the substituents on each ring are not identical (i.e., one ring has nitro and the other has something else), then the molecule is chiral. But in this case, each ring has the same substituents. So maybe it's achiral.

Alternatively, if the arrangement of substituents on the two rings is such that the molecule as a whole isn't symmetrical, then it is chiral.

But I'm not entirely confident. If I have to make a decision, I'll say that this compound (1) does exhibit optical isomerism because the arrangement around the central bond could lead to two enantiomers.

So to recap:

1. I'm not entirely sure, but suspect it might exhibit optical isomerism.

2. Yes, because there's a chiral center.

3. No, because no chiral centers.

4. No, because no chiral centers.

Wait, but earlier I thought that dimethyl fumarate didn't have any chiral centers. So looking back, the four compounds:

Which ones exhibit optical isomerism?

Compound 1: Maybe yes.

Compound 2: Yes.

Compound 4: No.

So if the question is which of the options lists the correct compounds, the options are:

Option A) 1,2,4.

But compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism, so option A is incorrect.

Option D) 1 and 2.

If both 1 and 2 are correct, then D is an option.

But I'm not confident about compound 1.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, when substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it can have axial chirality. So if the substituents are in such a way that the two rings are not symmetrical, the molecule is chiral.

In compound 1, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group. If these substituents are arranged in a way that they are not symmetrical across the central bond, then the molecule is chiral.

But I'm not entirely certain, but I think for the purpose of this question, compound 1 does exhibit optical isomerism.

So which options have 1 and 2? Option D is 1 and 2.

So the correct answer would be option A if 1,2,4 are correct, but I think 4 isn't. So if only 1 and 2 are correct, then option D is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 4 doesn't have any chiral centers, so option D (1 and 2) would include only those two.

Wait, but I'm now confused again. Let's see.

So, the four compounds:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate → possibly optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate → yes.

3. Benzophenone → no.

4. Dimethyl fumarate → no.

So the correct answer would include 1 and 2. Looking at the options:

Options:

A) 1,2,4 → includes 4 which I think is wrong.

B)3 and4 → both wrong.

C)2 and3 → only 2 is correct.

D)1 and 2 → both correct.

Thus, option A is wrong because 4 isn't correct. So option D is the correct choice.

To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Optical isomerism occurs when such a chiral center exists, leading to enantiomers.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. The substituents are a nitro group (-NO₂) and a carboxylate ester (-COOCH₃). The arrangement of these substituents around the central bond can lead to axial chirality, as the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. This makes the compound capable of exhibiting optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound includes a chiral center at the second carbon of the propanoate chain. This carbon is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl (-OH), a methyl (-CH₃), an ester group (-COOCH₃), and a hydrogen (-H). Since it has a chiral center, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone consists of two benzene rings connected by a ketone group. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, making it sp² hybridized and trigonal planar. A chiral center cannot exist in this structure, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, with a trans (E) configuration in the central double bond. The two carbons in the double bond are each bonded to a carboxylate ester group (-COOCH₃) and a hydrogen (-H). Since these carbons are not bonded to four different groups, there are no chiral centers. Thus, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism due to the presence of chiral centers or axial chirality. Compounds 3 and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: D**
