Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step.

The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Each particle can move along the x-axis in a tube. When they measured the position, all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function must be zero outside this region, right?

Hmm, wait. Or is it that the wave function isn't zero, but the probability is zero outside that region? Because in quantum mechanics, the wave function itself isn't necessarily zero, but the probability density is. The probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function.

So, the wave function is given as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me make sure I'm reading it right. Oh, the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by -0.5i? No, wait, the way it's written, it's the entire expression (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. So ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1+x)] - (0.5)i.

Wait, I think that's correct. So ψ(x) is a complex function. To find the probability density, I need to compute the absolute square of ψ(x), which is ψ*(x) * ψ(x). So, [a / sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i] multiplied by [a / sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i], since the complex conjugate of ψ(x) would be the real part minus the imaginary part. Wait, no. Let me think: ψ(x) is real_part + imaginary_part i. So the conjugate is real_part - imaginary_part i. So in this case, ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the conjugate would be (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i.

When I multiply them, I get (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2, because the cross terms (the ones with i) will cancel out. So, the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it correctly. Let's denote ψ = A + B i, where A is a/sqrt(1+x), and B is -0.5. So ψ* = A - B i.

Then, ψ* ψ = (A - B i)(A + B i) = A² + B². Because (A + B i)(A - B i) = A² - (B i)^2 = A² + B² since i^2 is -1 and the negative cancels.

So yes, the probability density is |ψ(x)|² = (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

But wait, the problem says that when they measured the particles, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. That implies that the probability is zero outside this interval. So, the probability density must be zero for x < 1 and x > 3.

But according to our expression, the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. How can this be zero? Well, that's impossible unless a² is negative, which can't be because a is a real number. So there's something I'm missing here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the wave function. Let me read the question again. The wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5i. So it's a function that's a real term minus an imaginary constant. But that's a bit odd because usually, the wave function would depend on x in both real and imaginary parts. Hmm. Or perhaps the wave function is time-dependent, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait a second. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the wave function. Maybe the entire expression is a function of x, so the real part is a / sqrt(1 + x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) + (-0.5)i.

Then, the probability density is |ψ(x)|² = (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

Wait, that can't be zero, because each term is positive. So this suggests that the wave function's probability is always non-zero, which contradicts the measurement results that particles are only found between x=1 and x=3.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Another approach: perhaps the wave function given is only valid for x between 1 and 3. So outside that range, the wave function is zero. But wait, in the given expression, it's non-zero for x > -1, but the measurements are between 1 and 3. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside 1 and 3. But the given function isn't zero outside that range, so that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is such that the probability density is zero outside 1 and 3. So the wave function must be zero outside that interval. But that's not what the given ψ(x) is.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is given as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) * e^{-i 0.5}, which would be a complex function. But the question writes it as (a/sqrt(1+x)) − 0.5i, which implies that it's a sum of a real term and an imaginary term, not a product.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about normalization. The wave function must be normalized so that the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx over all space is 1.

But according to the problem, the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3. So perhaps the given ψ(x) is correct only in that region, and zero elsewhere. But the question says that in the part of space where the particle can exist, the wave function is given as that. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside x=1 to 3.

But then, in the region x=1 to x=3, the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So, the probability density in that region is as I computed earlier: (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But that can't be zero. So the only way for the particle to be found only between 1 and 3 is if the probability density is zero outside this region, which would mean the wave function is zero outside. But inside, the probability isn't zero, but the given wave function isn't zero there.

This is confusing. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) multiplied by a complex exponential, but that's not what's given here. The given ψ is a real term plus an imaginary term.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the wave function is expressed in such a way that the probability is zero outside x=1 and x=3. So, in that case, the wave function must be zero outside, but within that interval, it's non-zero.

But the given wave function doesn't vanish outside 1 and 3. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside, and the expression given is for the region between 1 and 3. But the problem states that the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i in the part of space where it can exist. So perhaps the region where it can exist is between 1 and 3? Because the measurements only find particles there.

Wait, that would make sense. So the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i for x between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise.

Wait, but then when calculating the normalization, the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx must equal 1.

So let's compute |ψ(x)|², which is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx must equal 1.

Wait, but that integral is from 1 to 3. Let's compute it.

Let me denote the integral as I:

I = ∫ (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx from 1 to 3.

We can split this into two integrals:

I = a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3 + 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3.

The first integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 is ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to3.

So that's ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So I = a² * ln(2) + 0.5.

But I must equal 1, because the wave function is normalized.

So, a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Solving for a²:

a² = (1 - 0.5) / ln(2) = 0.5 / ln(2).

Then a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2)).

Wait, what's the numerical value of that?

Let me compute this:

ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7209.

Then sqrt(0.7209) ≈ 0.849.

So a is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that would be the correct answer.

To determine the value of \( a \), we analyze the wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), which is valid for \( x \) between 1 and 3. The probability density is given by \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \). Since the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the wave function must be normalized over this interval.

The normalization condition requires that the integral of the probability density over \( x \) from 1 to 3 equals 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx + \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 1.
\]

1. The first integral is \( a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx \). The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \), so:

\[
a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3 = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2).
\]

2. The second integral is \( 0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5 \).

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{1 - 0.5}{\ln(2)} = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \), we find:

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7209.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7209} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately 0.85, which corresponds to option B.
