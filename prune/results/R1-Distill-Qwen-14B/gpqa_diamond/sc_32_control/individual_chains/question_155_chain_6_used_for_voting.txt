Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the standard deviation formula. So, ΔP_z is the square root of the expectation value of P_z squared minus the square of the expectation value of P_z.

Wait, but wait. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x, right? The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Oh, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, I think that means the given state is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. That should make things easier because in that basis, the expectation value of P_z would just be the eigenvalue corresponding to the state.

But wait, maybe I should double-check. So, the state is a vector in the P_z basis. So, to find the expectation value of P_z, I don't need to do any complicated matrix multiplications because the state is already an eigenstate of P_z? Or wait, no. The state is an eigenstate of P_x, not of P_z. So, the state is a superposition of the P_z eigenstates. Therefore, calculating the expectation value of P_z would involve some work.

Let me think. The expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is given by the state vector ψ† multiplied by P_z multiplied by ψ. Since the state is given in the P_z basis, which is the same as the computational basis here, the matrix representation of P_z is diagonal. Oh wait, looking at the matrix for P_z, yes it's diagonal. The matrix is:

P_z = [[ℏ, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, -ℏ]]

So, the diagonal elements are ℏ, 0, -ℏ. Now, the state is a column vector [ -1/2 ; 1/√2 ; -1/2 ]. Let me write that as a column vector ψ = [a, b, c]^T, where a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2.

To compute ⟨P_z⟩, I can take the inner product of ψ with P_z ψ. Alternatively, since P_z is diagonal, ψ† P_z ψ is simply a* (ℏ a) + b* (0*b) + c* (−ℏ c). Wait, but since ψ is a real vector here, the complex conjugate doesn't matter. So,

⟨P_z⟩ = a^2 * ℏ + b^2 * 0 + c^2 * (-ℏ) 
= ( (1/4) * ℏ ) + 0 + ( (1/4) * (-ℏ) )
= (1/4 - 1/4) ℏ 
= 0.

Hmm, interesting. So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Well, since P_z is diagonal and real, P_z² is just the square of each diagonal element. So,

P_z² = [[ (ℏ)^2, 0, 0 ],
         [ 0, 0, 0 ],
         [ 0, 0, (−ℏ)^2 ]]

Which simplifies to [[ℏ², 0, 0],[0,0,0],[0,0,ℏ²]]

So, ⟨P_z²⟩ is calculated as ψ† P_z² ψ.

Which is a^2 * ℏ² + b^2 * 0 + c^2 * ℏ²
= ( (1/4) * ℏ² ) + 0 + ( (1/4) * ℏ² )
= (1/4 + 1/4) ℏ² 
= (1/2) ℏ².

So now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ − (⟨P_z⟩)^2) 

Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, (⟨P_z⟩)^2 is zero. So,

ΔP_z = sqrt( (1/2) ℏ² ) 
= sqrt( (ℏ²)/2 )
= (ℏ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, so the uncertainty is ℏ/sqrt(2), which would correspond to option B. But let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, the given state is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Let me square each component:

a^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4
b^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2
c^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4

So, when calculating ⟨P_z²⟩, it's a²*(ℏ²) + b²*(0) + c²*(ℏ²) = (1/4 + 1/4)*ℏ² = (2/4) * ℏ² = 1/2 ℏ². So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. The state given is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ℏ. Does that affect anything? Let me think. Since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, but we're measuring P_z, which doesn't necessarily commute with P_x. So the uncertainty principle comes into play here.

But for the calculations, I think the method I used is correct because I've correctly calculated ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ in the given state.

So, the uncertainty would be sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩^2) = sqrt( (ℏ²/2) - 0 ) = ℏ/sqrt(2). So the answer should be option B.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Expectation value of $P_z$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix representation of $P_z$ is diagonal:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Since the state is expressed in the $P_z$ basis, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar + 0 - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of $P_z^2$
The matrix representation of $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar^2.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Uncertainty $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, we have:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
