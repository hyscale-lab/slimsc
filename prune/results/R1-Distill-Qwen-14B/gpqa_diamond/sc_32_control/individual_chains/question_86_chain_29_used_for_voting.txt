Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that a chemist did two reactions. Each reaction used a different reducing agent on an unknown compound, and both resulted in the same product, which is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The options give different possibilities for the starting materials A and B.

Hmm, I remember that reducing agents like LiBH4 and BH3 are used for different types of reductions. Wait, LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3, right? Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, no, actually, BH3 is often used as a milder reducing agent, maybe for ketones or something. Or wait, maybe I should think about the specific reactions these agents are involved in.

Wait, another point: when you reduce a ketone, you get a secondary alcohol. But in this case, the product is a pyranone. Wait, pyran is a six-membered ring with an oxygen, like a cyclic ether. The product is tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So that's a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ketone with some substituents.

Wait, wait, when you have a ketone that's part of a ring, like a cyclic ketone, and you reduce it, maybe you're opening the ring. Or perhaps the starting material is an ester or another group that can form a ring upon reduction.

Wait, another thought: the product is a pyran-2-one. So that's a six-membered ring with oxygen and a ketone group. The substituents are 4-ethyl. So the ring has substituents at position 4, which is an ethyl group, and the ketone is at position 2.

So, the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So it's a bicyclic compound, maybe? Or perhaps it's a six-membered ring with an oxygen and a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Lactones are cyclic esters, and upon reduction, they can form diols or other structures. Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. Wait, LiBH4 is used for reducing esters to alcohols. So, if you have a lactone, which is an cyclic ester, and you reduce it, what happens?

Wait, lactone reduction with LiBH4: I think when you reduce a lactone (cyclic ester) with LiBH4, it gets converted into a diol. Because the ester group would be reduced to a glycol. Wait, but in this case, the product is a pyranone, which is a cyclic ketone. Hmm.

Wait another angle: maybe the starting materials are esters which, upon reduction, form the cyclic hemiacetal or something else. Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diketone or another structure that upon reduction forms a ring.

Wait, perhaps the reaction involves the reduction of a carbonyl group adjacent to an ether. Let me think about the mechanism. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an ester group.

Wait, wait, looking at the options, the possible starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid in different enantiomeric forms. So, structure-wise, this is a pentanoic acid with an ethyl group on C3, an isobutoxy group on C5, and a ketone (oxo) group on C5. Wait, that seems a bit conflicting because if C5 has both an isobutoxy and a ketone, how does that work?

Wait, wait, I think pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. So, position 1 is the COOH, then 2, 3, 4, 5. Wait, but that's not possible because pentanoic acid has 5 carbons, so positions 1 (COOH), 2, 3, 4,5 would be the methyl end? Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think. Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH? No, wait, that's longer. The structure is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. So the carboxylic acid is at the end. So, the positions are 1 (COOH), 2, 3,4,5 as the CH2 groups.

Wait, but the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the pentanoic acid has substituents on carbons 3 and 5. Carbon 3 has an ethyl group, and carbon 5 has both an isobutoxy and a ketone (oxo) group. Wait, but each carbon can't have two substituents unless it's a branching.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH - CH2 - CH(CH2CH2CH3) - C(OCH(CH2CH3)2) - O

Wait, wait, maybe the structure is:

The pentanoic acid is:

CH2(COOH) - CH2 - C(ethyl) - C(ketone and OCH2CH(CH2)2?) - CH3?

Wait, maybe it's better to draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is something like:

The pentanoic acid is CH2(COOH)-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O)-O-isobutyl?

Wait, that would make sense: the acid is at position 1, then position 2 is CH2, position 3 is CH with ethyl, position 4 is C=O connected to an isobutoxy group.

Wait, so the starting material is a pentanoic acid with substituents at positions 3 (ethyl), and position 5 (isobutoxy and a ketone? Or maybe position 4? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, the structure is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So pentanoic acid is five carbons, starting with COOH. So positions are 1 (COOH), 2, 3, 4, 5.

So, position 3 has an ethyl substituent, position 5 has both an isobutoxy and a ketone.

But wait, position 5 is the last carbon, which is a methyl group. So having both an OCH2CH(CH2CH3)2 (isobutoxy) and a ketone (O) doesn't make sense because the last carbon is CH3. So perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's 5-isobutoxy-5-oxo, meaning that on carbon 5, there's an isobutoxy group and a ketone. But wait, a ketone implies a carbonyl group, so the carbon would need to be connected to two other carbons. But if it's the fifth carbon of a pentanoic acid, which is the methyl end, the structure would be R-CO-O-R', but that doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is that the acid is at C1, then C2 is CH2, C3 is CH2 with ethyl, C4 is C(O)O-isobutyl, and C5 is just a methyl. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a six-membered ring, but the starting material is a linear molecule that cyclizes upon reaction.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an ester or an acid that upon reduction forms the cyclic hemiacetal or something. Let me think about the reactions.

When LiBH4 is used with an ester, like in the case of a lactone, the ester group is reduced to a diol. So, for example, a cyclic ester (lactone) would open up and form a diol when treated with LiBH4. Wait, but wait, LiBH4 might not reduce esters. Oh, no, wait, LiBH4 can reduce esters to alcohols. Let me think: esters are typically reduced by LiBH4 to the corresponding alcohols. So, for example, an ester RCOOR' is reduced to RCH2OR' (but that's not correct; more accurately, the ester is reduced to a primary alcohol if it's an aliphatic ester. Wait, no, correction: LiBH4 reduces esters to glycols if it's a cyclic ester (lactone), but for acyclic esters, it reduces them to the corresponding alcohols. Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, I remember that BH3 is used for more selective reductions, like of ketones, while LiBH4 is stronger and can reduce esters and amides as well.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone ester. For example, a diketone with an ester group that upon reduction forms a cyclic hemiacetal. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters that upon reduction form the cyclic hemiacetal. Wait, let's think about the product: it's a 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the structure is a six-membered ring with an oxygen, and a ketone group at position 2. The substituents at position 4 are ethyl.

So, the ring is O-C-C-C-C-C. The ketone is at position 2, which is the second carbon after the oxygen. So, the ring is:

O
||
C2=O
C3
C4 (ethyl)
C5
C6
C1 (ether oxygen)

Wait, perhaps the product is formed via a ring-forming process. So, maybe the starting material is a diacid or an ester that can cyclize upon reduction.

Wait, another thought: the product is a pyranone, which is a cyclic ketone. To form that, perhaps the starting material is a diketone that can undergo a ring-closing via a reduction. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diester or another structure that upon reduction forms a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are alpha-keto esters, which upon reduction form the cyclic structure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a cyclic hemiacetal. Let me think: when a gamma-keto ester is treated with a reducing agent, maybe it undergoes a reduction that forms a cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, but in the problem, the product is a pyran-2-one, so the ketone is part of the ring. So, the reduction must have formed a ring structure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester with a structure that allows ring formation upon reduction. For example, if the ester is at the end of a chain that can form a six-membered ring when reduced.

Alternatively, when a carbonyl is reduced, like a ketone, it becomes an alcohol. But if the starting material is an ester, perhaps the ester group is reduced to an alcohol, which then forms a ring upon elimination of the leaving group.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone, so maybe the reduction isn't of a ketone but of something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones) which, upon reduction, form diols. But I'm not sure how that would form a pyranone.

Wait, another angle: the product is (R) configuration. So the reduction must have been stereoselective. The starting material's configuration would dictate the product's configuration.

Looking at the options, the starting materials A and B are either (S) or (R) configurations of the same compound. So, when treated with different reducing agents (LiBH4 and BH3), they produce the same product (R) configuration. That suggests that the reaction may involve some kind of stereoselective reduction.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 (like BH3·THF) are different in their reducing abilities and how they affect stereochemistry. For example, BH3 is typically a reagent that would reduce ketones to secondary alcohols with anti addition (like in the hydroboration-oxidation of alkenes), but wait, that's for alkenes, not ketones. Wait, no, BH3 is used for ketone reductions, sometimes with different stereochemistry than other reagents.

Wait, when you have a ketone and you use BH3 followed by H+, you get a secondary alcohol. But what about the stereochemistry? Well, in the case of cyclic ketones, perhaps the approach of the borohydride would determine the configuration.

Wait, but in this problem, the product is a cyclic ketone, so maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester or another group that upon reduction forms the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester. For example, an ester with a ketone group adjacent to it. When reduced, the ester group could be converted into an alcohol, and the ketone into another alcohol, but that's not making a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an ester substituent. Upon reduction, the ester becomes an alcohol, leading to ring formation.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a ketone group. Upon reduction, the ester is converted to a diol, and the ketone is reduced to an alcohol. But how would that form a pyranone?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a 5-membered cyclic ester (gamma-lactone) with a ketone somewhere, and upon reduction, it forms a 6-membered ring.

Wait, let me think about the product structure again. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the ring is six-membered, with the ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4.

So, perhaps the starting material is a six-membered ring lactone (or another group) which, upon reduction, forms the pyranone.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me approach this differently. Since the product is the same from two different reactions, maybe the difference is in the stereochemistry of the starting material. The starting materials A and B are enantiomers, perhaps.

So, the reaction of A with LiBH4 gives (R)-product, and reaction of B with BH3 gives (S)-product? Or wait, in the question, both reactions give (R)-product. So, both A and B, when treated with their respective reagents, give the same (R) configuration.

Wait, the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the starting materials must have configurations that, upon reduction, lead to (R).

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are alpha-keto esters, and their reduction leads to the formation of the cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal which, upon oxidation, gives the pyranone. But that doesn't fit because the question says that the reactions are reductions.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the reducing agents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters to alcohols. BH3 is less strong and typically doesn't reduce esters unless they are activated. Wait, no, BH3 is usually used for ketones and aldehydes. Wait, but LiBH4 is generally a stronger reducing agent and can reduce esters, while BH3 might not. Or is it the other way around? No, I think LiBH4 can reduce esters, while BH3 (like in BH3·THF) is for ketones and alkenes.

Wait, so if the starting material is an ester, then treating it with LiBH4 would reduce the ester to an alcohol. But if the starting material is a ketone, then treating it with LiBH4 would reduce it to a secondary alcohol.

Wait, but the product is a pyranone (a cyclic ketone), so maybe the starting material is an ester that upon reduction forms a cyclic alcohol which then somehow forms the ketone. That doesn't make sense because LiBH4 would reduce the ester to an alcohol, not form a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed via a ring-closing reaction during reduction. For example, if the starting material is a beta-keto ester, reduction could lead to a ring formation.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, which upon reduction with LiBH4 forms a cyclic hemiacetal. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is at a position that allows for ring closure when the carbonyl is reduced.

Wait, let's consider the structure of the starting material: (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O)-OCH(CH2CH3)2.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me try to write the structure step by step.

Pentanoic acid: CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no. Let me number from the COOH end.

Carbon 1: COOH

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: CH(CH2CH2CH3) [ethyl group]

Carbon 4: C(O) [since it's 5-oxo]

Wait, wait, 5-oxo would be on carbon 5. But wait, the chain is only five carbons, so the fifth carbon is a methyl group. So, 5-oxo would imply a ketone on the fifth carbon, which isn't possible in a straight chain because the fifth carbon is the end. So, perhaps the structure is cyclic.

Alternatively, maybe it's a 5-membered ring. Hmm, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (a lactone) with an ethyl group and an isobutoxy group. Let's think about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an amino acid derivative, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, another approach: since both reactions yield the same product, the difference must be in how the reducing agents affect the starting material's configuration.

Assuming that the starting material has a chiral center, the product's configuration depends on how the reduction proceeds.

If the starting material is an ester, and the reducing agent reduces it to an alcohol, the configuration of the starting material's chiral center would influence the product's stereochemistry.

So, for example, if the starting material is (R) configuration, and the reduction forms a new chiral center, the product's configuration would depend on the mechanism.

Wait, but the product is a pyranone, which is a cyclic ketone. So, perhaps the reduction isn't of a ketone but of a different group.

Hmm, perhaps the starting material is a hemiacetal or another functional group that upon reduction forms the cyclic ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone. Wait, but I'm getting stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are alpha-keto esters, which upon reduction form cyclic structures.

Wait, now I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should think about the options given.

The options are all about the starting materials A and B being either (S) or (R) configurations of the same compound: 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, A and B are the same compound but in different enantiomeric forms.

But when you reduce A with LiBH4 and B with BH3, you get the same (R) product. So, perhaps the configuration of the starting material dictates the product's configuration.

Wait, but if both A and B are the same compound, then why would their reactions with different reagents give the same product? Unless the reagents don't affect the stereochemistry.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read.

The question says that two different reactions are performed. Each uses a different reducing agent on unknown compounds, and both give the same product. So, the product is the same from two different starting materials, each treated with a different reagent.

Wait, wait, no: the question says that the chemist took two unknown compounds (A and B) and treated them separately with two different reducing agents. So, both A and B are different compounds, each treated with a different reagent, and both give the same product.

Wait, no, the product is the same in both cases. So, A is treated with LiBH4 and H+ to give the product, and B is treated with BH3 and H+ to give the same product.

So, both A and B are different starting materials, when treated with different reagents, give the same product.

Wait, but the options given for A and B are either the same compound (same configuration) or different configurations.

Looking at the options:

Option D says A is (R) and B is (S) of the same compound.

So, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers, and depending on which reagent is used, they produce the same product.

Wait, but why would enantiomeric starting materials give the same product upon reduction? Unless the reaction doesn't create new chiral centers but retains one.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to inversion or retention of configuration.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are diastereomers, and the reagents determine the product's configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material doesn't affect the product's configuration because the reaction is stereospecific in a way that both enantiomers of starting material give the same product.

But that seems unlikely. So, perhaps the key is to determine whether the reduction leads to retention or inversion of configuration.

Wait, another thought: the product is a pyranone, which is a cyclic ketone. So, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone ester, and the reduction breaks the ester to form the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a 5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let me think about that structure.

So, the structure is:

COOH - CH2 - CH(CH2CH2CH3) - C(O)OCH2CH(CH2CH3)2.

Wait, no, the substituent on C5 (the fifth carbon) is isobutoxy and oxo. But a five-carbon chain can't have C5 as a carbonyl because that would require the fifth carbon to have two other carbons attached, which it can't. So perhaps the structure is cyclic.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester with a substituent. For example, a gamma-lactone with substituents that form the pyranone upon reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester. When reduced, the ester is converted to an alcohol, and the ketone is also reduced, but in a way that forms a ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, but I'm not making much progress here. Maybe I should think about the possible stereochemistry aspects.

The product is (R) configuration. So, the starting material must have a configuration that, upon reduction, leads to R.

If the starting material is (S), and the reduction leads to retention of configuration, then the product would be S. But in this case, the product is R.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction inverts the configuration.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, which isn't a chiral center necessarily. Wait, the product is (R) configuration at which center? The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the ethyl is at position 4, and the ketone is at position 2. Is there a chiral center in the product?

Yes, the product has a chiral center at position 4. Let me think: the structure at position 4 is attached to three different groups. Let me imagine the structure.

The product is a six-membered ring: positions 2 is the ketone (O), position 4 is the ethyl group. So, the ring has the structure:

O=C-O-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-

Wait, perhaps the structure is more accurately:

O
||
C2
O
|
C1-O
C3
C4 (with Et)
C5
C6

Hmm, perhaps the chiral center is at position 4. So, the groups attached are:

- The ring (two carbons from the ring)
- An ethyl group
- A hydrogen (if it's a chiral center)

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure about the structure. The exact structure might not matter for the stereochemistry part.

So, the product is R configuration at that center. So, the starting material's configuration, when reduced, leads to R.

If the starting material is (R), then perhaps the reduction leads to the same R configuration. Or maybe it leads to S.

But without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester with a chiral center, and when reduced, the configuration is retained or inverted.

Wait, another approach: consider that LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and might proceed via a different mechanism than BH3.

Wait, when you reduce an ester with LiBH4, it typically reduces the ester to a primary alcohol. But if the ester is part of a ring, like a lactone, then the reduction would break the ring and form a diol.

Wait, but this is getting me nowhere. Perhaps I should look for a pattern in the options.

Looking at the options, the only possibility where A and B are enantiomers is option D: A is R, B is S. So, if A is R and treated with LiBH4, gives R product, and B is S and treated with BH3, also gives R product. So, the reagents would have to cause inversion in one case and retention in the other.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents cause different outcomes in terms of stereochemistry.

Wait, another thought: LiBH4 is a more powerful reducing agent and may cause more extensive reduction, perhaps leading to different stereochemistry than BH3.

Wait, but in the case of ketone reductions, BH3 would add in a way that follows anti-Markovnikov addition, but for esters, it's different.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible reactions.

If the starting material is an ester, say, RCOOR', and it's treated with LiBH4, it would reduce the ester to RCH2OH and R'OH (probably, but I'm not exactly sure). Or maybe it reduces the ester to an alcohol without breaking the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), and upon reduction with LiBH4 or BH3, it opens the ring to form a diol, which then cyclizes again under certain conditions to form the pyranone.

Wait, another angle: The product is a cyclic hemiacetal. To form that, you'd need a diol and a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone ester, and upon reduction, the ester is reduced to an alcohol, allowing the ring to form.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. When reduced, the ester is converted to an alcohol, and the ketone is also reduced, leading to the formation of a diol which then forms a cyclic structure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is something like:

O
||
CO-O-R
|
CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-COOH

But I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible stereochemistry outcomes. The product is R configuration. So, whichever starting material leads to that when reduced.

If the starting material is R, and the reduction doesn't change the configuration, then the product would be R.

If the starting material is S, and the reduction inverts the configuration, then the product would be R.

So, which reagent causes retention or inversion?

Wait, in the case of ketone reductions, BH3 would add in a certain way, but perhaps with esters, the mechanism is different.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not a ketone reduction but an ester reduction. So, when an ester is reduced with LiBH4, it forms a primary alcohol. The configuration of the starting material would influence the configuration of the product.

Wait, but if the starting material is a chiral ester, then the reduction would depend on the configuration. If the ester is at a chiral center, the LiBH4 would reduce it to an alcohol, possibly retaining the configuration or inverting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction proceeds with retention of configuration.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option D: A is R, B is S.

If A (R) is treated with LiBH4 and gives R product, and B (S) is treated with BH3 and gives R product, then perhaps both reactions lead to retention of configuration.

But why would both reagents cause retention?

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material is opposite, and the reagents cause opposite stereochemical outcomes.

Wait, but without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to say. I think I'm overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D because the starting materials are enantiomers, and depending on the reagent, they produce the same product. But why would that be the case?

Wait, perhaps the reagents cause the same configuration in the product regardless of the starting material's configuration. But that would imply that the reaction doesn't depend on the starting material's configuration, which is possible if the reaction is not stereoselective.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's configuration depends on the starting material's configuration in a specific way. For example, if the starting material is R, and the reagent is LiBH4, it gives R product. If the starting material is S and the reagent is BH3, it also gives R.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps when the starting material is R and treated with LiBH4, the product is R. When the starting material is S and treated with BH3, the product is R. So, the reagents cause different outcomes based on the starting material.

But without knowing the exact mechanism, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D, where A and B are enantiomers, and the reagents lead to the same product.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not stereoselective, so both enantiomers of starting material give the same product.

But that's possible if the product's configuration isn't influenced by the starting material's.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's configuration is determined by the reducing agent's approach.

Hmm. I'm not entirely sure, but based on the options, I think the correct answer is D: A is R, B is S.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves two reactions where different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, are used to reduce two unknown starting materials, A and B, to produce the same product: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The task is to determine the correct starting materials A and B from the given options.

### Key Observations:
1. **Product Structure**: The product is a six-membered cyclic ketone (pyranone) with a ketone group at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. The product has an (R) configuration at the chiral center.
2. **Reducing Agents**: 
   - **LiBH4**: A strong reducing agent that can reduce esters to alcohols.
   - **BH3**: Typically used for selective reductions, such as reducing ketones to secondary alcohols.
3. **Starting Materials**: The options suggest that A and B are enantiomers of the same compound: (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid or (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

### Analysis:
- The starting materials are enantiomers, meaning they differ in configuration at the chiral center. The configuration of the starting material will influence the stereochemistry of the product.
- The product's (R) configuration suggests that the stereochemical outcome of the reduction depends on the starting material's configuration and the reducing agent used.
- **Option D** proposes that A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This is consistent with the idea that the two enantiomers, when reduced with different reagents, produce the same (R)-configured product. This could occur if the reduction mechanism leads to retention or inversion of configuration in a way that results in the same final product.

### Conclusion:
Based on the stereochemical considerations and the options provided, the correct starting materials are **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid** and **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.

Answer: D
