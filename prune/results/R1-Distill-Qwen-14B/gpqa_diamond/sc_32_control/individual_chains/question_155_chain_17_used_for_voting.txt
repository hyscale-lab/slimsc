Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the uncertainty in P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable, like P_z, when the system is in a state |ψ⟩, is given by the formula ΔP_z = sqrt⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩ − ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩². Right? So I need to calculate both the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared.

But wait, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x, which means that when you measure P_x, you'll get a specific eigenvalue. The given state is a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). I'll call this vector |ψ⟩.

The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which makes sense because when working with eigenstates, it's often easier in the basis where the operator is diagonal. So the operators P_x, P_y, and P_z are being represented in this basis.

Now, I need to find the expectation value of P_z. The expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩. Let me write down P_z matrix again. It's diagonal, right? The first diagonal element is ħ, the second is 0, and the third is -ħ. So P_z = [[ħ, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -ħ]].

To compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩, I can calculate each component. The vector |ψ⟩ is [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ].

So let's compute each term:

The first term is (-1/2)² * ħ, but wait no, wait. Let me think. Because when you multiply |ψ⟩ by P_z, each component is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element. So P_z |ψ⟩ would be:

First component: (-1/2) * ħ
Second component: (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 = 0
Third component: (-1/2) * (-ħ) = (ħ/2)

Then, |ψ⟩^† P_z |ψ⟩ is the inner product of |ψ⟩ with this resulting vector.

So let's compute each term:

First element of |ψ⟩ is -1/2, multiplied by first element of P_z |ψ⟩ which is (-1/2) ħ. Wait no, perhaps better to compute the inner product directly.

Wait no, maybe I should compute it as ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ = sum_{i} ψ_i^* (P_z)_{i,j} ψ_j.

But since P_z is diagonal, (P_z)_{i,j} is zero unless i=j. So it's sum_i ψ_i^* (P_z)_ii ψ_i.

So for each diagonal element:

i=1: (P_z)_11 = ħ, ψ_1 is -1/2. So term is (-1/2)^* * ħ * (-1/2).
i=2: (P_z)_22=0, so term is 0.
i=3: (P_z)_33 = -ħ, ψ_3 is -1/2. So term is (-1/2)^* * (-ħ) * (-1/2).

So let's calculate each:

i=1: ( -1/2 ) * ħ * ( -1/2 ) = (1/4) ħ
i=3: (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) = (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) → Wait, let me compute each step.

Wait, more precisely: for i=3, it's ψ_i^* which is the conjugate of (-1/2), which is (-1/2) (since real number), multiplied by (P_z)_{33} which is -ħ, multiplied by ψ_i which is (-1/2). So:

(-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) = (-1/2) * (-ħ) = (ħ/2), then multiplied by (-1/2) gives -ħ/4.

Wait wait, maybe I should compute each term:

i=1: ψ_1 is -1/2, (P_z)_{11} is ħ, so term is (-1/2) * ħ * (-1/2) = (1/4) ħ.

i=2: term is 0.

i=3: ψ_3 is -1/2, (P_z)_{33} is -ħ. So term is (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) = (-1/2) * ( (-ħ) * (-1/2) ) → Wait, wait, no, the multiplication order is ψ_i^* * (P_z)_ii * ψ_i.

So for i=3:

ψ_i^* = (-1/2)^* = (-1/2) because real.

(P_z)_33 = -ħ.

ψ_i = (-1/2).

So term is (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) = ?

Let me compute step by step:

Multiply the three terms:

(-1/2) * (-ħ) = (ħ/2), then (ħ/2) * (-1/2) = - ħ/4.

So i=1 gives 1/4 ħ, i=3 gives -1/4 ħ.

So the sum is (1/4 ħ) + 0 + (-1/4 ħ) = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is 0. Interesting.

So the expectation value of P_z is zero. That's helpful.

Now, I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩, which is ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩. Again, since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is also diagonal, with elements (ħ)^2, 0, and (ħ)^2. Wait, no. P_z squared is [[ħ^2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, ħ^2]] since (-ħ)^2 is ħ^2.

So, same approach as before. Each term is ψ_i^* (P_z^2)_{i,i} ψ_i.

i=1: (ħ^2) * (-1/2)^2 = ħ^2 * (1/4)
i=2: 0
i=3: ħ^2 * (-1/2)^2 = ħ^2 * (1/4)

So sum is (1/4 ħ²) + (1/4 ħ²) = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ħ².

Putting it all together, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt( (1/2) ) ħ.

Which is ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, that's option B.

Alternatively, let me double-check my steps.

Wait, wait. The initial state |ψ⟩ is a column vector (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me verify the normalization. The sum of squares is ( (-1/2)^2 ) + ( (1/√2)^2 ) + ( (-1/2)^2 ) = (1/4)+(1/2)+(1/4) = 1. So it's normalized.

Calculating ⟨P_z⟩:

Each term:

i=1: (-1/2) * ħ * (-1/2) = (1/4) ħ
i=2: 0
i=3: (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) = (-1/4) ħ
So sum is 1/4 ħ -1/4 ħ = 0.

Yes, that's correct.

⟨P_z^2⟩:

i=1: (1/4) ħ²
i=2: 0
i=3: (1/4) ħ²
Sum: (1/2) ħ².

So the variance is (1/2) ħ², so uncertainty is sqrt(1/2) ħ = ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle,
\]

where $| \psi \rangle$ is the given state vector $(-1/2, 1/\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$ and $P_z$ is the diagonal matrix:

\[
P_z = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\hbar & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -\hbar
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Since $P_z$ is diagonal, the calculation simplifies to:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_{i} \psi_i^* (P_z)_{i,i} \psi_i.
\]

- For $i=1$: $(P_z)_{1,1} = \hbar$, $\psi_1 = -1/2$, so the term is $(-1/2) \cdot \hbar \cdot (-1/2) = \hbar/4$.
- For $i=2$: $(P_z)_{2,2} = 0$, so the term is $0$.
- For $i=3$: $(P_z)_{3,3} = -\hbar$, $\psi_3 = -1/2$, so the term is $(-1/2) \cdot (-\hbar) \cdot (-1/2) = -\hbar/4$.

Summing these terms:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \hbar/4 + 0 - \hbar/4 = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \hbar^2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_{i} \psi_i^* (P_z^2)_{i,i} \psi_i.
\]

- For $i=1$: $(P_z^2)_{1,1} = \hbar^2$, $\psi_1 = -1/2$, so the term is $(-1/2)^2 \cdot \hbar^2 = \hbar^2/4$.
- For $i=2$: $(P_z^2)_{2,2} = 0$, so the term is $0$.
- For $i=3$: $(P_z^2)_{3,3} = \hbar^2$, $\psi_3 = -1/2$, so the term is $(-1/2)^2 \cdot \hbar^2 = \hbar^2/4$.

Summing these terms:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \hbar^2/4 + 0 + \hbar^2/4 = \hbar^2/2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\hbar^2/2 - 0^2} = \sqrt{\hbar^2/2} = \hbar/\sqrt{2}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\hbar/\sqrt{2}$.
