Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem says that a chemist did two reactions using two different reducing agents on unknown compounds A and B. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. The task is to figure out what A and B are, given the options.

Hmm, wait a minute. So reaction 1: A is treated with LiBH4 and H+ to give the R enantiomer. Reaction 2: B is treated with BH3 and H+ to give the S enantiomer. I think the key here is understanding how the reducing agents affect the stereochemistry of the product.

I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually used in certain conditions. Wait, but BH3 is a milder reducing agent, right? Or is it the other way around? Oh yeah, BH3 (like BH3·THF) is a milder reagent and typically leads to different stereochemical outcomes compared to LiBH4.

Wait, no, actually, I think both are used for reductions, but in different contexts. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, more powerful, and can reduce things like carbonyl groups to alcohols. BH3 is used for the same, but maybe under different conditions. Oh, wait, I'm confusing with something else. Oh right, BH3 is used in the hydroboration reaction, but here in this problem, it's probably being used as a reducing agent for a carbonyl group.

Wait, more accurately: both LiBH4 and BH3 (with H+ workup) can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. But I think the key is whether the reduction is stereoselective. Oh wait, wait: when a carbonyl is reduced to an alcohol, the configuration of the resulting chiral center depends on the method of reduction. But wait, in this case, the starting material would have to have a carbonyl group, perhaps. Because when you reduce a carbonyl to an alcohol, you're making a new chiral center if the carbonyl was adjacent to other substituents.

Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's imagine the structure. Pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. 2H-pyran-2-one is a lactone, right? Because 2-one means a ketone in the ring. So the structure would be a cyclic ester, like a gamma or delta lactone.

Wait, when you reduce a lactone, you break the ring. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the product is a ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a carbonyl that, upon reduction, becomes a secondary alcohol, but the product here is a ketone. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't a reduction of a ketone but something else.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a ketone, and the reducing agents are used in some other context. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an ester or a lactone.

Wait, no, let's think again. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the structure would be a six-membered ring with one oxygen (like a tetrahydropyran ring), with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4.

So, the product is a cyclic ketone. How would that form from a reaction? Let me think about possible reactions. Maybe the starting material is an acyclic ketone that underwent a ring-forming reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal that is being opened and then reduced. Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), but when you reduce it, you get a diol or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let's think differently. The reactions involve reduction of a carbonyl group. So the starting material must have a carbonyl group that, upon reduction, forms an alcohol. But the product is a ketone, so that suggests that the starting material's carbonyl group was something else. Wait, no: the product is (R) or (S) 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a ketone. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if you reduce a ketone, you get a secondary alcohol, not another ketone. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide or something else. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of the reduction of a lactone. A lactone is an ester ring. When you reduce a lactone with LiBH4, does that open the ring? Or perhaps the reaction is a reduction of a cyclic ketone to a secondary alcohol, but that doesn't fit the product structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone group. Wait, another angle: perhaps the starting material is a ketone that is part of a larger ring, and upon reduction, it becomes an alcohol, but the product is a different structure.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an ester, which upon reduction becomes a diol. But I'm getting confused. Let's try to think about the reagents.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters to alcohols. Wait, no, LiBH4 typically doesn't reduce esters to alcohols; for that, you usually need something like LiAlH4. Wait, LiBH4 does reduce ketones to secondary alcohols and aldehydes to primary alcohols, but esters? Hmm, I think esters are not reduced by LiBH4 under normal conditions. But maybe under certain conditions, like high temperatures or with other catalysts.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), which, upon reduction, opens the ring. Let me imagine that. So, a lactone (ester) has a carbonyl group. If you reduce that with LiBH4, would it become a diol? Because when you reduce an ester, you typically get a glycol. Wait, no, wait: reducing an ester with LiBH4 would typically not go to completion; LiAlH4 is better for esters. But maybe in this problem, it's a specific case.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone, but that doesn't fit because the product is a ketone. Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the reactions are not reductions but something else? No, the question says they're reducing agents.

Wait, alternative approach: the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's consider the structure as a six-membered ring with an oxygen (so tetrahydropyran), a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

So, the ring is a chair or boat structure with the substituents. When this is formed, perhaps it's via a condensation reaction, like a Claisen or similar.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal or something similar. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. Because when a gamma-keto ester undergoes a reduction, it can form a cyclic hemiacetal, which would then become a cyclic ketone upon some rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the mechanism of the reduction. Let's think about the product being a cyclic ketone, so when you reduce a carbonyl, you get an alcohol. But the product is a ketone, so that doesn't fit. So maybe the starting material is an acetal or something else that, when reduced, forms the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the key is the stereochemistry. The products are enantiomers, R and S. So the starting materials must have some chiral centers that influence the product's configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting compounds A and B are esters with a chiral center adjacent to the ester group. When they are reduced, the configuration of that chiral center will determine the configuration of the new chiral center in the product.

Let's think about the reduction of an ester. When an ester is reduced, under certain conditions, it can become a diol. But how would that form a cyclic ketone? Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, another approach: the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's imagine how that might form from a reduction. If the starting material has a gamma-keto ester structure, perhaps upon reduction, the ester is converted into a diol, which then cyclizes to form a ring with a ketone.

Wait, for example, if you have a gamma-keto ester like CH2-CO-O-R, then reducing the ester part might break it down. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, and upon reduction, it forms something else. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester. When a beta-keto ester is reduced, it can form a secondary alcohol. But how does that lead to a cyclic ketone?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone ester. Like a cyclic beta-keto ester. When reduced, it could form a diol, which then cyclizes to form a ring with a ketone. Hmm. For example, something like a six-membered ring where the reduction of a carbonyl forms a new structure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the stereochemistry of the reduction. The reagents are LiBH4 and BH3 with H+ workup. I remember that in the reduction of carbonyl groups, the stereochemistry of the resulting alcohol can depend on the method of reduction. For instance, using BH3 followed by H2O2 and then acid (the typical hydroboration-oxidation) leads to anti-Markovnikov addition and specific stereochemistry based on the starting alkene. But in this case, both reagents are being used for reducing a carbonyl group, not an alkene.

Wait, wait, no. LiBH4 and BH3 are both used for carbonyl reductions. But I think BH3 is used in the formation of alkenes via hydroboration, but when used as a reducing agent, perhaps the conditions are different. Alternatively, perhaps the BH3-Lewis acid (like in BH3·THF) is used for reducing esters or ketones.

Wait, but in the problem, both reactions are reductions. So perhaps the difference between LiBH4 and BH3 lies in the way they affect the stereochemistry of the product.

Wait, when reducing a ketone with a chiral center adjacent, how does that affect the product's configuration? Let me think. If the starting material has a chiral center, the reduction could lead to retention or inversion of configuration, depending on the mechanism.

Wait, in the reduction of a ketone (R2C=O) to R2CH(OH), the alcohol's configuration is determined by the approach of the hydride. For ketone reductions, the hydride typically approaches from the less hindered side, leading to an alcohol with the opposite configuration if the starting chiral center was in a certain way.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a carbonyl group, and when reduced, it forms a new chiral center. The configuration of this new center will depend on the reducing agent used.

Wait, but in the products, the configurations are R and S. So the starting materials must have some configuration that, upon reduction with different reagents, leads to either R or S.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal, and upon reduction, the ring is opened, and the configuration is determined by the reagent.

Wait, wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester with a chiral center. When the ester is reduced, the resulting alcohol would have a new chiral center, whose configuration depends on the reduction method.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting material is an acyclic ester, which upon reduction and cyclization forms the cyclic ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a lactone (cyclic ester). When reduced, the ester is converted into a diol. Then, the diol could open the ring, and perhaps under certain conditions, cyclize again to form a cyclic ketone. But I'm not certain about that.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the structures in the options and see if any patterns emerge. The options are all 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acids with different configurations.

Wait, so the options are A, B, C, D, each with different configurations. Let me write them.

Option A: A and B are both (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Option B: Both A and B are (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Option C: A is (S), B is (R).

Option D: A is (R), B is (S).

So both starting materials are the same compound but with opposite configurations? Or do they have different configurations?

Wait, the products are R and S enantiomers. So the starting materials must have specific configurations that lead to the R and S products upon reduction.

So, the starting materials are A and B, which are treated with different reducing agents, leading to opposite configurations.

Wait, perhaps when A is treated with LiBH4, it leads to R, and B (same or different starting material) with BH3 leads to S.

So the key is how each reducing agent affects the configuration of the product.

Wait, perhaps LiBH4 leads to retention of configuration, and BH3 leads to inversion? Or vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps the reducing agent's strength affects the reaction pathway. LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent, so perhaps it leads to a different stereochemistry.

Wait, another thought: in the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, the hydride would attack the carbonyl carbon. The approach of the hydride (from LiBH4 or BH3) could be from the same face or opposite face, leading to retention or inversion of configuration.

Wait, but in a ketone, the carbonyl is planar, so the hydride could attack from either face, leading to a racemic mixture. But in the case of a chiral starting material, perhaps the existing chiral centers would influence the approach.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester, like CH3-CO-CH2-COOR, and when reduced, it forms a secondary alcohol. The configuration of the new alcohol would depend on the approach of the hydride.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on the exact mechanism. Maybe I should think about the stereochemistry of the product based on the starting material's configuration.

Suppose the starting material A is (R) configuration, and when reduced with LiBH4, it produces (R) product. Alternatively, LiBH4 could lead to inversion, so if starting material is R, the product would be S.

Wait, but the product is (R) when A is treated with LiBH4. So perhaps the starting material's configuration (R) leads to (R) product, implying same configuration. Or perhaps opposite.

Alternatively, perhaps LiBH4 and BH3 have different selectivities in the reduction of the same starting material. So, if A is a certain configuration, treating with LiBH4 would produce R, and treating with BH3 would produce S.

Wait, but in the problem, the two starting materials A and B are treated with different reagents, leading to R and S products, respectively.

So, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers, and the different reagents cause the product to have opposite configurations.

Wait, if A is R and B is S, then when A is reduced with LiBH4, maybe it leads to R product, and B with BH3 leads to S product. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the key is that LiBH4 and BH3 lead to opposite configurations when reducing the same starting material.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain about that. Let me think about the actual reduction mechanisms.

In the case of a ketone being reduced to a secondary alcohol, the configuration of the new chiral center is determined by the approach of the hydride. For a prochiral ketone (where the carbonyl is between two different groups), the hydride can attack from either face, leading to a racemic mixture. But if the starting material is chiral, perhaps the existing chiral center affects the approach, leading to a specific configuration.

Alternatively, in some cases, the reducing agent can influence the face from which the hydride attacks, leading to diastereoselectivity or enantioselectivity.

Wait, but in the problem, the same starting material (A and B) might have opposite configurations. So when A is treated with LiBH4, it gives R, and when B is treated with BH3, it gives S.

Hmm, perhaps the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent determine the product's configuration.

Wait, another angle: The starting materials are (R) or (S) 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

The structure would be something like:

CH2CH2-C(O)-O-C(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the structure as:

The pentanoic acid is CH2CH2-C(O)-O-R, where R is isobutoxy.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2-C(O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2 where the CH2 is connected to another CH2 or something else.

Wait, perhaps the 5-oxo part is a ketone, so at position 5, making it a gamma-keto ester.

So, the structure would be:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH ?

Wait, no, that doesn't fit. Let me think again.

The compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the pentanoic acid has 5 carbons.

So, positions 1 to 5: COOH is at position 1, then CH2, then CH(CH2CH3) (ethyl group at position 3?), then C(O)OCH(CH2)2 (isobutoxy group) at position 5, and a ketone (oxo) at position 5.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(COOH)-CH2-C(O)-O-CH2CH(CH2CH3) ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it as:

Position 1: COOH
Position 2: CH2
Position 3: CH(CH2CH3)
Position 4: C(O)OCH(CH2CH3)2 (isobutoxy)
Position 5: O (from oxidation state?)

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's a beta-keto ester. So the structure might be CH2-CO-O-CH(CH2CH3)2, with an ethyl group attached.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (3-ethyl)-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the pentanoic acid has a ketone at position 5, and an isobutoxy group also at position 5. That would make it a cyclic ester, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-CH(CH2CH3)2

Wait, no, that doesn't fit the description.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH2-C(O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2, but with another substituent.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction.

The product is a cyclic ketone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, perhaps the starting material, when reduced, loses the ester group and forms the cyclic structure.

Wait, but wait, if the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, reducing it could lead to a cyclic hemiacetal, which upon further reaction forms the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Maybe I should think about the reduction of a gamma-keto ester.

Gamma-keto esters have the structure RCO-COOR', and upon reduction, they can undergo various reactions. For example, reducing the ketone part could lead to an alcohol, but I'm not sure how that would form a cyclic structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction leads to the cleavage of the ester and the formation of a diol, which then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, another approach: the product has a six-membered ring. So, perhaps the starting material, when reduced, forms a diol that can cyclize into a six-membered ring with a ketone.

Wait, let's imagine the starting material is an ester, say, RCOOR', and upon reduction, it becomes RCH2OH and R'OH, but I'm not sure how that would form a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), which upon reduction, opens the ring. But I'm not sure how that would form the product.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the stereochemistry first. The products are R and S enantiomers, so the starting materials must have configurations that lead to opposite configurations upon reduction with different reagents.

Let me think: if a starting material is R configuration, and when reduced with LiBH4, it gives R product; when the same starting material is reduced with BH3, it gives S product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents cause the opposite configuration in the product.

Wait, I think that in the reduction of a ketone, the configuration of the product depends on the approach of the hydride. If the starting material has a certain configuration, the hydride could attack from the same face (leading to same configuration) or opposite face (leading to opposite configuration), depending on the reducing agent.

So, perhaps LiBH4 and BH3 lead to opposite configurations when reducing the same starting material.

So, for example, if starting with an R configuration, LiBH4 gives R in product, and BH3 gives S.

In the problem, A is treated with LiBH4 to give R, and B is treated with BH3 to give S. So, if A and B are enantiomers, then treating each with the different reagents would lead to the desired products.

Wait, no. Because if A is R and B is S, then using LiBH4 on A would give R, and BH3 on B would give S. But that depends on whether the reagents cause same or opposite configurations.

Wait, but perhaps the reagents cause the product configuration to be the same as the starting material. So, if A is R, LiBH4 gives R; B is S, BH3 gives S.

But in that case, A and B would have to be different compounds. Wait, but in the options, the starting materials are either same or enantiomers.

Looking at the options, options C and D have A and B as enantiomers. Option C has A as S and B as R. Option D has A as R and B as S.

So, if A is R and B is S, and when A is reduced with LiBH4 gives R, and B is reduced with BH3 gives S, then that would match the problem's scenario.

Wait, but how do the reagents affect the configuration? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

I think that in the reduction of a beta-keto ester, the stereochemistry of the new chiral center is influenced by the existing configuration. So, perhaps the approach of the hydride is influenced by the neighboring group.

Wait, for example, in the reduction of a beta-keto ester, the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the configuration of the adjacent chiral center affects the approach.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the key is that when using LiBH4, the reduction leads to retention of configuration, and BH3 leads to inversion.

So, if the starting material's configuration is R, LiBH4 would make the product R, and BH3 would make it S.

Alternatively, the opposite could be true.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let's think about this.

Assume that LiBH4 leads to retention of configuration, and BH3 leads to inversion.

So, if starting material A is R, treated with LiBH4 gives R product. Starting material B is S, treated with BH3 gives S product.

But in the problem, A is treated with LiBH4 to give R, and B is treated with BH3 to give S.

Wait, but in that case, A and B would have to be enantiomers. So, their configurations are opposite.

Looking at the options:

Option D: A is R, B is S.

So, if A is R, LiBH4 gives R product, and B is S, BH3 gives S product.

Yes, that would fit.

Alternatively, if the reagents cause the opposite effect, but I'm not sure.

Another possibility: If the hydride attacks the same face in both cases, but the starting materials have opposite configurations, leading to opposite products.

Wait, perhaps LiBH4 and BH3 induce different facial attacks on the carbonyl.

But I'm not sure about the exact mechanisms. Maybe I should look at the options again.

The products are R and S. So, option D has A as R and B as S, which are enantiomers. If LiBH4 reduces A to R and BH3 reduces B to S, then that would match.

Alternatively, if the starting materials are the same, which is not the case in the options except for A and B.

Wait, in options A and B, both A and B are the same configuration. So, if A and B are same, then reducing with different reagents would produce same product, which isn't the case. So those options can be ruled out.

So, the correct option must be either C or D.

In the problem, A is treated with LiBH4 to give R, and B with BH3 to give S.

Assuming that the reagent determines the configuration: if A is R and treated with LiBH4 gives R, and B is S and treated with BH3 gives S.

So, the correct starting materials would be A as R and B as S, which is option D.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the starting materials might be enantiomers. So, if the starting materials are enantiomers, their reduction with different reagents would produce the required enantiomers.

Thus, the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves two reactions where unknown compounds A and B are treated with different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, to produce enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. The task is to determine the starting materials A and B from the given options.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reagents and Stereochemistry**:  
   - LiBH4 and BH3 are reducing agents, but they can influence the stereochemistry of the product differently.  
   - The products are enantiomers (R and S), indicating that the starting materials must have specific configurations that lead to opposite configurations in the products depending on the reducing agent.

2. **Structure of the Products**:  
   - The product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, is a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. This suggests that the starting materials are likely related to a gamma-keto ester or a similar structure that can form this cyclic ketone upon reduction.

3. **Options Analysis**:  
   - The options provide four possibilities for the starting materials A and B, all of which are (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.  
   - Options A and B suggest that A and B are the same compound, which would not produce enantiomeric products when treated with different reagents. Thus, these options can be ruled out.  
   - Options C and D suggest that A and B are enantiomers (A = S, B = R in C; A = R, B = S in D). This aligns with the requirement for enantiomeric products, as the reagents would produce opposite configurations based on the starting material's stereochemistry.

4. **Reagent-Specific Effects**:  
   - LiBH4 and BH3 can influence the stereochemistry of the product by affecting the approach of the hydride ion to the carbonyl carbon.  
   - If A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and treated with LiBH4, it would produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Similarly, if B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and treated with BH3, it would produce (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This matches the problem's description.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting materials are A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, as these enantiomers, when treated with LiBH4 and BH3, respectively, produce the required enantiomeric products.

**Answer: D**
