Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let's break down each part.

First reaction: Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So, when a ketone reacts with cyanide, what typically happens? I remember that in the presence of a base, ketones can undergo a substitution reaction. Oh right, the CN- acts as a nucleophile. But wait, how does that happen in ketones?

Wait, butanone plus NaCN. So sodium cyanide is a source of CN- ions. Since ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition, the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. So the mechanism would be the CN- adding to the carbonyl, forming a cyanohydrin, which is what the product seems to be. So the product is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached. So that makes sense.

But what reagent A is needed for that? The reaction conditions for forming a cyanohydrin typically involve using a strong acid or a base. Wait, no, wait. I think that for the formation of cyanohydrins, you usually use an acid catalyst. Because the acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. Then the CN- can attack, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin.

So, when NaCN is added to a ketone under acidic conditions, it forms the cyanohydrin. So reagent A would have to be an acid, probably H3O+ (which is a common acid catalyst). So in the options, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a source of H+ and HSO3^-.

Wait, the reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. So if A is H3O+, that makes sense because the acid would protonate the ketone, making it more reactive towards nucleophilic attack by CN-.

So in the options, looking at option A: A is H3O+, that's a possibility. Option D has A as NaHSO3. So which is correct?

Wait, another thought: sometimes, when using HCN, the reaction is done under acidic conditions. But NaCN in aqueous solution would give CN- and Na+ ions. So in the presence of an acid like H3O+, the ketone is protonated, making it more electrophilic, and the CN- can attack.

So for the first reaction, the correct A is H3O+.

Now moving to the second reaction. The product from the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, no, the second starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Wait, that's a bit more complex. So the starting material is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group.

The reaction is with reagent B and water to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, how does a nitrile group turn into a carboxylic acid? Well, typically, nitriles are converted to carboxylic acids via hydrolysis. But under what conditions?

Nitrile hydrolysis can be done in acidic or basic conditions. For example, in acidic conditions, using H2SO4 and heat, the nitrile converts to an amide which then becomes a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, in basic conditions, like with aqueous NaOH, you might get a different product, like a carboxylate.

Wait, but the product here is a carboxylic acid, not a salt. So if the reaction is done under acidic conditions, after hydrolysis, the acid would protonate to form the carboxylic acid.

So the second reaction uses reagent B and water. So what's B? If the reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, then the conditions are H3O+ or HCl (acidic).

Looking at the options, option A has B as HCl. Option B has B as CH3COOH (acetic acid), which is also an acid. So which one is correct?

Wait, but another possibility: nitrile hydrolysis under certain conditions. For primary nitriles, hydrolysis in acid (like with H2SO4 and heat) yields carboxylic acids. If you have a secondary or tertiary nitrile, like in this case, it's more complex. But in our case, the nitrile is attached to a carbon that's connected to a hydroxyl group and a benzyl group.

Wait, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the nitrile is on a carbon that's also attached to a hydroxyl group and a butane chain. So it's a secondary nitrile, I think.

Wait, but for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, the mechanism typically goes through an amide or an imidamide intermediate. So in acidic conditions, the nitrile would first protonate, then add water to form an amide, and then further hydrolyze to the carboxylic acid.

So, the conditions for this reaction would be aqueous acid. So if the reagent B is HCl, which is a strong acid, then adding water would provide the necessary H+ and H2O to drive the hydrolysis.

Alternatively, if B is H3O+ (like in option A), but in the options, option A is for reagent A, not B. Wait, for the second reaction, reagent B is used with water.

So in the second reaction, it's 2-hydroxybutanenitrile derivative plus B + H2O. So the conditions would need to be acidic. So B could be HCl (option A) or CH3COOH (option B).

Wait, but in the options, the choices for B are either HCl, CH3COOH, or others. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) A=H3O+, B=HCl
B) A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH
C) A=NaHSO3, B=HCl
D) A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH

So for the first reaction, I think A must be H3O+ (acid). So looking at options A and B for the first part.

Now for the second reaction, the B reagent is either HCl or acetic acid. So which one would facilitate the nitrile to carboxylic acid conversion?

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Another thought: sometimes, HCl in aqueous solution is used as a catalyst for such reactions. Alternatively, using a strong acid like HCl would protonate the nitrile, making it more reactive towards water attack.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is done under basic conditions, but no, because the product is a carboxylic acid, which is formed under acidic conditions, not basic, because in basic conditions, the product would be the conjugate base (carboxylate).

So for the second reaction, the presence of H2O and an acid (B) would be needed. So in the options, B must be an acid.

Looking at the options, option A: B is HCl (a strong acid). Option B: B is acetic acid (a weak acid). Which is more likely?

In some cases, strong acids are used to drive the reaction. For example, using HCl as the acid. Alternatively, sometimes a catalytic amount of acid is sufficient, like H2SO4.

Wait, but the reaction is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile plus B (H2O) → 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So it's the hydrolysis of the nitrile group.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible reagents in each option.

In the first reaction, if A is H3O+ (as in options A and B), then that fits with the acid-catalyzed addition of CN- to the ketone.

In the second reaction, B is either HCl or acetic acid.

So the second reaction needs an acid. So both options A and B are possibilities, but which acid would be used?

Wait, another thought: the second reaction is a hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. The typical reagents for this are strong acid and heat, or a strong base. Wait, wait, no. Wait, nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid is usually done in acidic conditions. Let me recall: when nitriles are hydrolyzed with strong acid (like H2SO4) and water, they form carboxylic acids. Alternatively, using a base (like NaOH) would give a carboxylate, which when acidified becomes the acid.

So, in the second reaction, the reagent B is the acid. So if B is HCl (as in option A), that would make the solution acidic, facilitating the hydrolysis.

Alternatively, if B is acetic acid, that's a weak acid. But perhaps it's enough as a catalyst.

Wait, but I'm not too sure. Another angle: the first option for reagent A is H3O+ as in options A and B. So if the first part is correct with A=H3O+, then the second part's B would be either HCl or acetic acid.

Which of these conditions would lead to the formation of the carboxylic acid from the nitrile?

In the presence of HCl (a strong acid), the nitrile would be protonated, making it more susceptible to attack by water. So the reaction would proceed through the addition of water.

So, for the second reaction, B is HCl, which is option A.

Wait, looking at the options, option A says reagent B is HCl. Option B says B is acetic acid.

So putting it all together: first reaction uses H3O+ (A) and the second uses HCl (B). So the correct option would be option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the options. Option A is A=H3O+ and B=HCl. So that would fit.

But wait, another thought: sometimes, the first part uses NaHSO3 as a reagent. What's that for?

Wait, wait, the first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN. So the product is a cyanohydrin. For that, we usually use an acid catalyst. Sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3) is a source of H+ and HSO3^-.

Wait, does the reaction proceed under acidic conditions when using NaHSO3? Because NaHSO3 would dissociate into Na+ and HSO3^- in solution. HSO3^- is a weak acid, so it can donate a proton.

Wait, but if A is NaHSO3, then the solution would be acidic because HSO3^- can act as an acid. So would that also work?

So perhaps the first reaction could be run with either H3O+ or NaHSO3 as the acid catalyst. So which one is correct?

Hmm, but the options are such that in options C and D, A is NaHSO3.

Wait, but the product in the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That's a cyanohydrin formed from butan-2-one and NaCN. The conditions for this can be either acidic or basic? Wait, no, I thought it's usually done under acidic conditions.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the presence of a base, the carbonyl might deprotonate, but CN- is a stronger base than the enolate, so maybe the reaction can proceed without acid. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: in the presence of a base, the ketone's alpha hydrogen might be abstracted by the base, leading to an enolate. But then, the enolate is a stronger base than CN-, which is a weaker base. So maybe CN- can't attack in basic conditions. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is done under neutral conditions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me recall: the cyanohydrin formation typically uses an acid catalyst. For example, in the presence of H2SO4, the ketone is protonated, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, allowing CN- to attack.

So in that case, the correct A would be H3O+ or H2SO4, but in the options, the choices are either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ as well. Because in solution, it can donate a proton, making the solution acidic. So perhaps either H3O+ or NaHSO3 could work as the acid catalyst for the first reaction.

But looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+; options C and D have A as NaHSO3.

So which one would be correct for the first reaction?

Wait, but the first reaction's product is a cyanohydrin. If the conditions are acidic, both H3O+ and NaHSO3 would provide the necessary H+.

But wait, NaHSO3 is a weaker acid than H3O+. H3O+ is a strong acid, while NaHSO3 has a pKa around 1.8, which is also quite strong. Wait, but H3O+ is a stronger acid, but maybe either would work.

But in the context of the question, the options have either H3O+ or NaHSO3 as reagent A.

So if the first reaction uses NaHSO3 as the acid, then the correct option would be C or D.

But I thought the first reaction requires an acid, so maybe it can be either.

Wait, but maybe there's another consideration. What about the possibility of the formation of side products?

Wait, in the first reaction, if A is NaHSO3, then the solution would have HSO3^- ions. Could that affect the reaction?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction uses HCN in an aqueous solution with a catalyst. Wait, but the question says the reagent is NaCN, so the CN- comes from that.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is done under basic conditions. Wait, but that wouldn't make sense for the formation of a cyanohydrin because the mechanism typically requires acidic conditions.

So, in any case, the first reaction needs an acid. So the options are either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Now, looking back to the possible answers, if the first reaction uses H3O+, then the correct option is A or B.

The second reaction uses B, which is either HCl or something else.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck on whether the second reaction uses HCl or acetic acid as the reagent.

Another approach: what's the role of H2O in the second reaction? The presence of water is for hydrolysis.

So the second step is nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. For that, the typical reagents are strong acid (like HCl in H2O) under heat.

So, for the second step, B is HCl. So that would point to option A: A = H3O+, B=HCl.

So putting it all together:

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + H3O+ → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Second reaction: the nitrile compound + HCl (in H2O) → the carboxylic acid.

So the correct option is A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Yes, that seems to fit.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the correct reagents for two reactions:

1. **Reaction 1**: Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.  
   - Butan-2-one is a ketone, and NaCN provides the nucleophile CN⁻. For the formation of a cyanohydrin, an acid catalyst is typically required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by CN⁻.  
   - Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) and NaHSO₃ (a source of H⁺) can both act as acid catalysts. However, H₃O⁺ is the more straightforward and commonly used acid for this type of reaction.

2. **Reaction 2**: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B and H₂O to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.  
   - This reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Such hydrolysis typically requires acidic conditions to facilitate the reaction.  
   - Among the options, HCl (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this reaction, as it provides the necessary acidic environment for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  - H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction as an acid catalyst. HCl is suitable for the second reaction as it provides the acidic conditions needed for nitrile hydrolysis.  
  - This option is consistent with the requirements of both reactions.

- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  - While CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is an acid, it is a weak acid and less effective than HCl for driving the hydrolysis of the nitrile group in the second reaction.  
  - This option is less favorable.

- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  - NaHSO₃ can act as an acid catalyst for the first reaction, but H₃O⁺ is more commonly used. HCl is suitable for the second reaction.  
  - This option is less favorable compared to Option A.

- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  - NaHSO₃ can act as an acid catalyst for the first reaction, but CH₃COOH is a weak acid and less effective for the second reaction.  
  - This option is the least favorable.

### Conclusion:
The most suitable reagents for the given reactions are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, as they align with the requirements of both reactions.
