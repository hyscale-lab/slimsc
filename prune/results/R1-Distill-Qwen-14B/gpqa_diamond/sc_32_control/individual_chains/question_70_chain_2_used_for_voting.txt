Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The problem talks about a series of reactions, and I'm supposed to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry groups, but let me try to break this down. First, I think I need to figure out what the compounds A, B, C, D, E, etc., are based on the reactions given.

Let me start with the reactions.

Reaction 1: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, A + 8B → C. Bright red product—maybe something like copper(II) sulfate? Or perhaps sulfur? Wait, no, sulfur is bright red when powdered. Alternatively, maybe a transition metal compound. Another thought: 8 equivalents is a lot. For example, if A is copper, and B is oxygen, but I'm not sure. Or maybe A is sodium, but that's probably too simple.

Wait, another possibility: solid A could be a metal, and B could be a diatomic gas. For example, if A is sodium (Na) and B is Cl2. But 8 equivalents of Cl2? That doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe A is Fe and B is O2? Let me think.

Wait, another approach. Let's look at reaction 3: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is reacted with water, it breaks down into A, F, and G. 

If F is a strong acid and G is a weak one, maybe F is H2SO4 (strong) and G is HNO2 (weak)? Or another combination. Alternatively, perhaps F is HCl (strong) and G is H2S (but that's a weak acid). Or maybe F is H2SO4 and G is H3PO4? Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, considering that C is reacting with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E. And E is extremely hazardous. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents like H2O, ethanol, maybe something else. Hmm.

So, let's try to map this.

Let me think about the possible compounds.

First, let's think about reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G.

If F is a strong acid and G a weak one, perhaps F is H2SO4 and G is HNO3? Or maybe HCl and HCOOH? Wait, but let me think about what C could be. C is formed from A and 8 equivalents of B. So perhaps A is an oxide or another compound.

Wait, maybe A is a metal, like copper. Let's say A is copper metal. B might be sulfur, but sulfur as a gas? Not sure. Alternatively, B could be oxygen. Let's see: if A is Cu and B is O2, 8 equivalents would be a lot. But Cu plus O2 in solid form—maybe forming CuO? But how would that fit with other reactions?

Alternatively, perhaps A is sodium (Na), B is Cl2. Let's see: Na reacts with Cl2. 8 equivalents of Cl2? For sodium, the reaction is 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. So 8 moles of Cl2 would require 16 moles of Na, but that would form 16 moles of NaCl. But product C would be NaCl? Or perhaps some other compound.

Wait, but product C is a bright red solid. Sodium chloride isn't red. Hmm. So maybe A is a metal, and B is another gas that forms a colored compound.

Another thought: perhaps A is sulfur. But sulfur is a solid, and reacting with a gas. Let's see. If B is O2, then A (sulfur) + O2 would form SO3? No, sulfur burning in O2 forms SO2 or SO3. But SO3 is a liquid or gas, not solid. Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms something else.

Wait, let's think about reaction 3 again. If C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, gives two acids. For example, maybe C is an ammonium salt, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate or sulfate.

Wait, let's think of C as a sulfide. For example, if C is CuS or something. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a mixed salt.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with D (gas), 2 equivalents produce E, which is extremely hazardous. What's an extremely hazardous product? Maybe something like phosgene, sarin, or other nerve agents, but perhaps more likely something like SO2 or something else. Another possibility is HCl gas, but that's not extremely hazardous in small amounts. Or maybe E is a highly toxic gas like HCN? Or perhaps E is something like NO or NO2.

Wait, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So D and B react to make H, a solvent. Examples of solvents include H2O, ethanol, acetone, etc.

So, possible reactions:

If B is Cl2, D could be something that reacts with Cl2. But what would form H, a solvent? For example, if B is Cl2 and D is H2O, then H could be HCl (but that's a gas, not a solvent). Alternatively, if D is something else.

Wait, another angle. D and B form H, a solvent. Let's say B is O2. Then D could be something like C (carbon). But C isn't a gas. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2. Then H would be H2O, a solvent. That makes sense. So, B is O2, D is H2. Then, D reacts with B (O2) in a 1:1 ratio to form H2O. That's possible.

So, reaction: D (H2) + B (O2) → H (H2O, a solvent).

So B is O2, D is H2.

Now, let's go back to reaction 1: A reacts with 8 equivalents of O2 to form C (bright red). What solid reacts with O2 in such a way? Maybe a transition metal. For example, copper reacts with O2 to form CuO, but that's black. Iron reacting with O2 can form Fe3O4, which is black. Hmm. What about lead? Lead oxide can be red. Lead(II,IV) oxide is dark brown, but perhaps another form? Alternatively, maybe vanadium? Vanadium pentoxide is a bright orange.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is sulfur (which is a solid) and B is O2. Sulfur burning in O2 produces SO3? Or SO2. But SO3 isn't a solid. Wait, perhaps C is SO3, but that's a gas. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps A is something else.

Wait, another possibility: C is PbO2, which is dark brown. Not red. Hmm.

Another possibility: maybe C is mercury(II,IV) oxide? No, that's red? Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a different oxide.

Alternatively, perhaps A is Fe, and B is O2, forming Fe3O4, which is a black solid. Not bright red.

Wait, another approach: the reaction of C with water gives A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid.

Suppose C is a nitrate salt. For example, if C is AgNO3. When AgNO3 reacts with water, it dissociates into Ag+ and NO3^-; but that doesn't form acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite or sulfate.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide. If C is a sulfide, then reacting with water would produce H2S (weak acid) and the corresponding metal hydroxide. But F is a strong acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed carbonate and sulfate? Not sure.

Wait, another angle: maybe C is a metal oxide. For example, if C is CuO, which is black, but the product is red. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide of a transition metal that's red. For example, CuS is black, but maybe another sulfide. Alternatively, As2S3 is red.

Wait, As2S3 is a red solid. But does As react with O2 to form As2S3? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps C is something else.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal, and B is a halogen. For example, A is Na, B is F2. 8 equivalents of F2 would require 4 moles of Na (since 2 Na + F2 → 2 NaF). But then, 8 F2 would need 16 Na? That would make 16 NaF. But I'm not sure if that fits the other reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps A is carbon, but reacting with O2 would form CO or CO2, which are gases, not solids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is of a metal with another gas. Let's think about a reaction where a metal reacts with a diatomic gas to form a bright red solid.

Wait, what about vanadium pentoxide (V2O5)? It's an orange solid, but not red. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfide. Sulfides of some metals are red. For example, CdS is yellow, As2S3 is red.

Wait, if the first reaction is something like As (solid) + S (gas? No, S is solid. Not possible.) Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: maybe A is a metal and B is another element. Let's think of the reaction where A is Fe and B is S. Fe reacts with S to form FeS, which is black. Not red. Or FeS is black, FeS2 is also black.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck on this. Maybe I should try to think of E and work backwards.

E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. D is H2 (since earlier I thought D is H2, as B is O2, and D + B → H2O). So, C reacts with H2 in 2 equivalents to produce E.

What could E be? If C is a metal oxide, reacting with H2 could produce metal and water. But that's probably not an extremely hazardous product.

Alternatively, if C is a sulfate salt, reacting with H2 might produce something else. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: C is a nitride. Let's say C is Fe3N. Reacting with H2 might produce NH3 and metal. But that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate. If C is CaCO3, reacting with H2 might not do much. Or perhaps, if C is a sulfite, reacting with H2 might produce SO2, but that's a gas.

Wait, but E is produced in the reaction of C with D (H2). And E is extremely hazardous. What's a product of a metal oxide reacting with H2? For example, if C is Fe3O4 and reacts with H2, it would form Fe and H2O. But that's not hazardous.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide. Let's say C is CuS. Reacting with H2 might not do much. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitro compound. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with water, it gives A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, perhaps C is a salt that contains two different acid components. For example, maybe it's a sulfite and another anion.

Wait, another thought: suppose C is CuSO4·5H2O, which is blue. Doesn't fit the bright red. Alternatively, maybe C is PbCrO4, which is yellow. Not red.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide of a transition metal. Let's say it's CoS. CoS is a black solid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a vanadium compound. Vanadyl sulfate is a yellow crystalline solid. Not red.

Alternatively, maybe C is an oxide of a transition metal that forms two different acids upon hydrolysis. For example, perhaps it's a mixed oxide.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide of a transition metal that when it reacts with water, it produces a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, suppose C is FeS. Reacting with water might not do much, but if it's more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate. For example, if C is Ca(NO3)2, but when it reacts with water, it just dissolves into ions. That doesn't produce acids necessarily.

Wait, another idea: perhaps C is a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3. Reacting with water doesn't do much, but if it's a more reactive carbonate, perhaps it can produce CO2 and the corresponding base. But that would produce a base, not an acid.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach. Let's think about the possible symmetry groups and what compounds have those.

The options are:

A) C2: This is the dihedral group of order 4, which includes a 180-degree rotation and two reflections.

B) D4h: The dihedral group of order 8, which includes a square planar symmetry with horizontal mirror planes and inversion.

C) D∞h: This is the symmetry of a linear molecule with an infinite number of symmetry operations, like O2 or HCN.

D) C2v: The group has a C2 axis and two vertical mirror planes. It's common in molecules like H2O (but H2O has C2v symmetry).

Wait, E is extremely hazardous. So, what are some extremely hazardous substances? Maybe sarin gas, but that's an organophosphate. Alternatively, phosgene (which is O=C(Cl)2) is highly toxic. Phosgene has a symmetry structure. Let me think about its structure.

Phosgene is O=CCl2. The molecule is planar, with the central carbon double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. So, it's trigonal planar. Its symmetry group would be D∞h? Or perhaps C2v?

Wait, no, the symmetry of phosgene is D∞h. Because it's linear (no, it's planar, but the molecule has a center of symmetry. Wait, no, the molecule is planar with a trigonal arrangement. Hmm. Let me think again.

Phosgene's structure is O=C(Cl)2. The central carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. So, the molecule is planar, with the C=O and two C-Cl bonds in the same plane. The molecule has a C2 axis perpendicular to the plane, because if you rotate 180 degrees, the two Cl atoms swap places. Also, there are two mirror planes: one vertical through the C=O bond, and another through the other C-Cl bond? Or maybe more.

Wait, perhaps it's D∞h? Or maybe D2h. Alternatively, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the point group of phosgene is D∞h because of the infinite symmetry in the plane. No, that's not right. Wait, D∞h is the symmetry group of linear molecules like CO2 or HCN, which have a center of symmetry and an infinite number of mirror planes perpendicular to the main axis.

Phosgene isn't linear, it's planar trigonal. So, the symmetry group would be D3h? Or maybe C2v.

Wait, let me think about the symmetry elements of phosgene. The molecule has a C2 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. It has a mirror plane that includes the C=O bond and the central C. It also has another mirror plane that includes the other C-Cl bond and the central C. So, perhaps the point group is C2v.

Wait, C2v has a C2 axis and two vertical mirror planes. Yes, so in phosgene's case, if the molecule has a C2 rotation (180 degrees) and two mirror planes (each containing the C=O and one C-Cl), then the point group is C2v.

Alternatively, maybe it's D3h? No, D3h would have more symmetry elements, like three mirror planes. But phosgene has two mirror planes, so maybe C2v is correct.

So, if E is phosgene, its symmetry group would be C2v. But looking at the options, option D is C2v. So, is that the answer?

But wait, let me think if E could be something else with a different symmetry group.

Another possibility for E is a highly toxic gas like HCN. HCN is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. So, if E were HCN, the symmetry group would be D∞h, which is option C.

Hmm. So I'm a bit torn between options C and D.

How can I figure out what E is?

Let me recap the reactions.

A + 8B → C (bright red solid)

C + 2D → E (extremely hazardous)

C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)

D + B → H (solvent)

Earlier, I thought B is O2 and D is H2. So let's go with that for now.

So, B is O2, D is H2.

Then, in reaction 1: A + 8 O2 → C (bright red solid). So, A is a metal that reacts with O2 in a 8:1 ratio. Wait, 8 equivalents of O2. That would mean 8 moles of O2 per mole of A. So, if A is a metal with a valency that requires O2 in that ratio.

Wait, for example, if A is Fe, oxidation state +3. The reaction could be Fe + O2 → Fe3O4. The stoichiometry for Fe3O4 is 3 Fe + 2 O2 → Fe3O4. So that's 3 Fe per 2 O2. But in the problem, 8 O2 per 1 A. So 8 O2 per mole of A.

So, let's say A is a metal that, when oxidized, uses 8 moles of O2 per mole.

Wait, perhaps A is P? Let me see. P reacts with O2 to form P4O10. The reaction is P4 + 5 O2 → P4O10. So for each mole of P4, 5 moles of O2 are used. So if A is P, then 8 O2 would require (8/5) moles of P4. But that doesn't fit the 8 equivalents.

Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur. Sulfur reacts with O2 to form SO3. The reaction is S + 3 O2 → 2 SO3. But that's for S8 forming 8 SO3. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide. Let's think about a metal that when oxidized uses 8 O2 per mole.

Wait, another approach: the product C is a bright red solid. Maybe it's a sulfide of a transition metal. Wait, CdS is yellow, As2S3 is red. So if A is As, and B is S (but S is a solid, not a gas). So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is PbO2, which is dark brown. No, not red.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride? Not sure.

Wait, back to reaction 3: C reacts with water to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid).

If F is a strong acid, like H2SO4, and G a weak acid, like HNO2, then C might be a sulfonate or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate salt that upon hydrolysis releases nitric acid (HNO3, strong) and another acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: suppose C is ammonium sulfide ((NH4)2S). Reacting with water would produce NH3 (a weak base, so maybe not, but the problem says acids). Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, if C is a sulfate salt, like Na2SO4, reacting with water wouldn't produce acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester? Not sure.

Another thought: if C is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Reacting with water doesn't produce acids. But if it's a carbonate of a heavier metal, perhaps it can hydrolyze into a strong acid and a weak one.

Wait, for example, maybe C is a mixed carbonate. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite. If C is Na2SO3, then it hydrolyzes to H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). But the problem says two acids are formed.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride. For example, if C is NH2OH (hydroxylamine?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfamide. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfonamide. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a phosphate. Let's think: if C is (NH4)3PO4. Reacting with water would produce H3PO4 (weak acid) and NH4OH (weak base), but the problem says two acids. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another approach: perhaps C is a nitrate. Let's say C is Ca(NO3)2. Reacting with water would dissociate into Ca²+ and NO3^-; but that doesn't give any acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfonate salt, like Na2SO4. No, that's a neutral salt.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should go back and try to think of E's structure. Because if E is phosgene (O=CCl2), its point group is C2v (option D). But if E is HCN, which is D∞h (option C), that's a possibility.

Wait, but HCN is a linear molecule, so it's D∞h. Phosgene isn't linear, so it's C2v. So, which one is more likely?

Now, looking at reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of H2 (assuming D is H2) to produce E.

So, if C is something that when reacted with H2 gives something like phosgene or HCN.

Wait, let's think about if C is a sulfide. Suppose C is SO2Cl2 (thionyl chloride). Reacting SO2Cl2 with H2? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is something that upon reaction with H2 produces HCN.

Wait, perhaps C is a cyanide salt. For example, if C is NaCN, reacting with H2 would produce HCN and NaH. But HCN is a gas, so perhaps E is HCN.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrile, like CH3CN. Reacting with H2 could produce CH3CH2NH2 (maybe, but that's not HCN).

Wait, another angle: perhaps C is a metal cyanide. For example, Fe(CN)6^3- or something. Reacting with H2 might not produce HCN directly.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorosulfite. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorate. For example, if C is KClO3, which is a bright red solid? Wait, KClO3 is a pale yellowish solid. Hmm, not red.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is PbCrO4, which is yellow. Not red. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide of a transition metal that's red. Wait, maybe As2S3 is a red solid.

If C is As2S3, then reaction 2 with H2 (2 equivalents) would produce something. As2S3 + H2 → ?

As2S3 + H2 might produce As and H2S. But that doesn't lead to E being HCN or phosgene. So probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitro compound. Let me think.

Wait, another possibility: maybe E is Cl2O, phosgene is OCl2. Wait, OCl2 is dichloride oxide, which is similar to phosgene.

Wait, no, phosgene is O=CCl2, which is CCl2O.

Wait, if C is COCl2, and when it reacts with H2, perhaps it produces HCl and CO. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorate, like KClO3. Then, reacting with H2 would produce KCl and H2O. But that's not dangerous.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress here. Let me try to think of E's possible structure and symmetry.

If E's symmetry group is D∞h, then it's a linear molecule. So E could be HCN, phosgene isn't linear. Wait, phosgene is planar but not linear, so D∞h wouldn't fit.

Wait, no, D∞h includes linear molecules. Phosgene isn't linear; it's planar but trigonal. So its symmetry is C2v. HCN is linear, so it's D∞h.

So, if E is HCN, then its symmetry group is D∞h (option C). If E is phosgene, it's C2v (option D). 

Which one is more likely?

Looking at reaction 2: C + 2 H2 → E.

If E is HCN, then C would have to be something that when reacted with H2 produces HCN. For example, if C is NH2Cl (ammonia chloride?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrile, like CH3CN. Reacting with H2 might produce CH3CH2NH2 (but that's not HCN).

Wait, another possibility: if C is a cyanide salt, like K4[Fe(CN)6], and reacting with H2 would produce HCN. But the stoichiometry isn't clear.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonyl, like Fe(CO)5. Reacting with H2 might produce CO, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorinated compound, like CCl2F2, which upon reaction with H2 could produce HCl and F2? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is HCl gas. But HCl isn't extremely hazardous in small amounts. It's a common acid.

Alternatively, maybe E is something like Cl2O (phosgene? No, phosgene is O=CCl2), which is dichloride oxide.

Wait, ClO2 is chlorine dioxide, which is a dangerous gas. Its structure is bent, so the symmetry group would be C2v.

But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps E is SO2, which is a toxic gas. Its structure is bent, so symmetry group C2v. So, the symmetry group would be C2v (option D).

Hmm. So, if E is SO2, then what is C?

Looking back, reaction 2 is C + 2 H2 → SO2.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because SO2 plus H2 would require a catalyst and high temperature to produce H2S and H2O? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reactions again.

Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red solid). If B is O2, and A is a metal that forms a red oxide. Wait, perhaps A is iron, and C is FeO(OH), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps A is a metal, B is Cl2. So, 8 equivalents of Cl2 per mole of A. The reaction could be A + 4 Cl2 → ACl4, but I'm not sure.

Wait, for example, if A is Sn (tin), then Sn + Cl2 → SnCl4. But SnCl4 is a liquid or gas, not a solid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is Ti. Ti reacts with Cl2 to form TiCl4, which is a liquid or gas, not a solid.

Hmm. Maybe I'm on the wrong track. Let me think of the other reactions.

Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G.

If F is H2SO4 (strong) and G is HNO2 (weak), then C must be a sulfate and nitrite salt. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, F could be HCl (strong) and G could be H2S (weak). Then, C would be a sulfide salt, like Na2S. Reacting with water would produce 2 NaOH + H2S↑. But NaOH is a strong base, not acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but the problem says F and G are acids. So, if C is a sulfide, then reacting with water would produce a strong base (like NaOH) and H2S, which is a weak acid. But the product is acids, so perhaps C is a different kind of salt.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate and sulfate. For example, a mixed salt like Ca(NO3)2·(SO4). But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester. For example, if C is something like CH3SO3H. Reacting with water would just dissociate into ions, but that doesn't produce two acids.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me think about E again.

If E has a D∞h symmetry group, it's a linear molecule. The options for E being a linear, extremely hazardous substance could be HCN, CO, or NO. But CO and NO are gases but not extremely hazardous in small amounts (though they are toxic). Alternatively, maybe phosgene is the right choice, but its symmetry is C2v.

Alternatively, perhaps E is ClF3, which is a highly toxic gas. ClF3 has a trigonal pyramidal structure, so its symmetry group is C3v, which isn't one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps E is O3 (ozone), which has a bent structure, so C2v symmetry. Ozone is a toxic gas, but I'm not sure if it's extremely hazardous.

Wait, the problem says E is extremely hazardous. Phosgene is a well-known highly toxic gas, so maybe E is phosgene.

If E is phosgene (O=CCl2), its symmetry group is C2v (option D). So the answer would be D.

But earlier I thought if E is HCN, the symmetry group is D∞h (option C).

I'm a bit confused, but given the options, and the fact that E is formed by reaction of C with H2, perhaps E is HCN, which has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, another point: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. If B is O2 and D is H2, then H is H2O, a solvent. That fits.

So, reaction 2: C + 2 H2 → E.

If H2 is in excess, maybe C is a compound that, when hydrogenated, gives HCN. For example, if C is a nitrile, like CH3CN, which upon hydrogenation produces CH3CH2NH2 (which is not HCN). Alternatively, perhaps C is a cyano group attached to something else.

Wait, another possibility: C is NaCN. Reacting with H2 would produce HCN and NaH. But would that require 2 equivalents of H2? Let me think.

The reaction would be 2 NaCN + H2 → 2 HCN + 2 NaH.

That's plausible. So, if C is NaCN, then reaction with H2 would produce HCN (E) and NaH.

But then, what is C? C is NaCN, which is a white solid, not bright red. Hmm. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but the problem says C is a bright red solid. So that can't be the case.

Alternative approach: perhaps C is a sulfide, which upon reaction with H2 produces H2S (weak acid) and a metal. But that leads to E being H2S, which isn't extremely hazardous.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitro compound. For example, C could be a nitrobenzene derivative, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. I'm stuck again. Given the time I've spent, I think I should make an educated guess based on the earlier points.

If E is phosgene, its symmetry group is C2v (option D). If E is HCN, it's D∞h (option C).

Given that the question's reaction 3 produces two acids, and if E is phosgene, which is O=CCl2, perhaps C is a chlorosulfuric acid derivative. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorosulfonate ester. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and E is CO2, which is linear (D∞h symmetry). But CO2 isn't extremely hazardous in small amounts.

Wait, another extremely hazardous compound is sarin gas, which is an organophosphate. But its structure is more complex, and I'm not sure about its symmetry group.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a nerve agent like VX, but I don't know its structure well.

Hmm. I think I'll have to go with the earlier point that if E is phosgene, its symmetry group is C2v, which is option D. So the answer would be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of chemical reactions, and the goal is to determine the molecular symmetry group of compound E. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. This suggests that A is likely a metal or a compound that forms a colored oxide or sulfide. The bright red color of C could hint at a transition metal compound, though no definitive identification is made.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. Gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Based on the reasoning, B is identified as O₂ (oxygen gas), and D is identified as H₂ (hydrogen gas), making H as H₂O (water), a common solvent.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (a strong acid) and G (a weak acid). This suggests that C is likely a salt that dissociates into a metal hydroxide and two acids upon hydrolysis.

4. **Identifying E**: Since E is extremely hazardous, candidates include highly toxic gases like phosgene (O=CCl₂) or HCN (hydrogen cyanide). Phosgene is planar and has **C₂v** symmetry, while HCN is linear and has **D∞h** symmetry.

5. **Symmetry Group Analysis**:
   - If E is phosgene (O=CCl₂), its structure is planar with a central carbon atom double-bonded to oxygen and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. It has a **C₂v** symmetry group due to a C₂ axis and two vertical mirror planes.
   - If E is HCN, it is a linear molecule with a single bond between H and C, and a triple bond between C and N. Linear molecules like HCN belong to the **D∞h** symmetry group, which includes an infinite number of mirror planes perpendicular to the molecular axis.

6. **Final Consideration**: The problem does not provide enough information to definitively identify E, but based on the reasoning, phosgene (O=CCl₂) is a plausible candidate for E, given its planar structure and **C₂v** symmetry. This aligns with the reaction conditions and the description of E as extremely hazardous.

Based on the analysis, the molecular symmetry group of E is **C₂v**.
