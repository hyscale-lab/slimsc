Okay, so I have this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem gives me the Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2) [γ_μ, γ_ν]. I'm supposed to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

First, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of a term in the Lagrangian is important because it determines the renormalizability. If the dimension is positive, the term could lead to non-renormalizable interactions because higher-order terms might not be manageable.

So, let's break it down. Since the Lagrangian is in natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the mass dimension of the action is zero. The Lagrangian density has dimensions of [Mass]^4 because the integral over four spacetime dimensions (dx^4) has [Mass]^-4, so the integrand must have [Mass]^4 to make the action dimensionless.

Each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So for L_int = κ ψ̄ σ ψ F, each field and coupling contributes to the total dimension.

Let me list the fields and their dimensions:

- ψ is a Dirac spinor. The Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the Dirac equation has mass dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ (which is ψ† γ^0) also has 3/2.

- F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. The field strength tensor F has the same dimension as the electromagnetic field A. The photon A has dimension 1, because it's a vector potential with derivative terms. The field strength is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each derivative adds a mass dimension of 1, and A has 1, so F is [∂][A] = (1)(1) = 1. Wait, no, wait. Wait, A is a vector field, so in four dimensions, the field strength tensor F has the same dimension as ∂μ Aν, which is [∂][A] = (1)(1) = 1? Or wait, no, because F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ; each term is [∂][A], so F also has dimension 1.

Wait, but F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for a gauge field. For electromagnetism, A has dimension 1. So F would be ∂ A, which is dimension 2? Wait, no. Wait, in four dimensions, the field strength tensor F_{μν} is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. Each derivative is dimension 1, each A is dimension 1, so F has dimension 2.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The gauge field A has mass dimension 1 because the field tensor F is (∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ). So each ∂ is dimension 1, each A is dimension 1, so F has dimension 2. So F^{μν} has dimension 2.

Wait, but in the Lagrangian, F^{μν} would be in a term like F^2, which would have dimension 4, correct. Because, like the Maxwell Lagrangian is -1/4 F_{μν} F^{μν}, which is dimension 4, since each F is dimension 2.

Wait, but in this problem, the Lagrangian term is κ ψ̄ σ F. So each part:

ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, ψ has 3/2, σ_{μν} is made of γ matrices, which are dimensionless. So ψ̄ σ ψ would have dimension 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. Then F is dimension 2. So the total dimension of the term is [κ] + 3 + 2 = [κ] +5.

But the whole Lagrangian must have dimension 4, so [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1.

Wait, that's the calculation. So κ has mass dimension -1.

Now, regarding renormalizability. A theory is renormalizable if all the couplings have mass dimension ≤4 - (sum of fields' dimensions). Wait, no, more precisely, in four dimensions, a term in the Lagrangian is renormalizable if each coupling's dimension is greater than or equal to zero. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the dimension of the coupling is actually (4 - sum of fields' dimensions) because each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So for a term like g ψ̄ ψ ψ̄ ψ, which would have four fields: 3/2 each. So 4*(3/2) =6, so coupling g would have dimension 4 -6 = -2. But that's not a renormalizable term because the coupling's dimension is negative.

Wait, but in our case, the term is κ ψ̄ σ F. Let me calculate the dimension again:

Each ψ̄ is 3/2, ψ is 3/2, so together they contribute 3. F is 2. So the term is κ * [3 + 2] = κ *5. Because the term is scalar, I think the sum is 3+2=5, so [κ] = 4 -5 = -1. So yes, that gives [κ]=-1.

But for renormalizability, the coupling's dimension should be >=0. Because if it's negative, the interaction becomes relevant, leading to non-renormalizable terms. Because in four dimensions, a coupling with negative mass dimension implies that the interaction term is of higher dimension, hence not renormalizable. So, if [κ] is -1, which is less than zero, the term is non-renormalizable.

Wait, so the term in the Lagrangian with dimension 4 has a coupling with dimension -1. So that term is non-renormalizable. So the theory can't be renormalized because the coupling has a negative mass dimension. So the theory is not renormalizable.

Wait, but let me think again. I remember that in four dimensions, a term is renormalizable if its mass dimension is less than or equal to 4. Wait, no, wait. The field terms in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. Each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. The coupling constants' dimension is determined by this. So for each term, the product of the coupling and the fields must equal 4. So if the sum of the fields' dimensions in a term is S, then the coupling's dimension is (4 - S). For the term to be renormalizable, the coupling's dimension must be ≥0. Because if it's negative, then as you go to higher energies (or shorter distances), the coupling's strength grows, leading to Landau poles and making the theory not predictive at high energies.

So in our case, the sum of the fields in the term is: ψ̄ (3/2) + ψ (3/2) + F (2) → 3/2 + 3/2 = 3, plus F's 2 → 5. So 4 -5 = -1. So the coupling κ has dimension -1. That's negative, so the term is non-renormalizable.

So the answer is that the mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.

Looking at the options:

Option C says [κ]_M = -1. Theory not renormalizable. So answer is C.

To determine the mass dimension of \(\kappa\) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \(\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]\), and the fields involved are \(\bar{\psi}\), \(\psi\), and \(F^{\mu\nu}\).

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The Dirac spinor \(\psi\) and its adjoint \(\bar{\psi}\) have mass dimension \(\frac{3}{2}\).
- The field strength tensor \(F^{\mu\nu}\) for a gauge field has mass dimension \(2\), as it is derived from the gauge field \(A_\mu\) (dimension \(1\)) and its derivatives (\(1\) each).

### Step 2: Mass dimension of \(\kappa\)
The Lagrangian density must have mass dimension \(4\) in four spacetime dimensions. The term \(\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}\) contributes as follows:
- \(\bar{\psi}\) and \(\psi\) each have dimension \(\frac{3}{2}\), so their combined contribution is \(\frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3\).
- \(F^{\mu\nu}\) has dimension \(2\).
- The total dimension of the term is \([ \kappa ] + 3 + 2 = [ \kappa ] + 5\).

To ensure the Lagrangian has dimension \(4\), we solve:
\[
[ \kappa ] + 5 = 4 \implies [ \kappa ] = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Here, \(\kappa\) has mass dimension \(-1\), which is negative. This indicates that the interaction term is non-renormalizable because the coupling grows uncontrollably at high energies, leading to issues like Landau poles. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of \(\kappa\) is \(-1\), and the theory is not renormalizable.
