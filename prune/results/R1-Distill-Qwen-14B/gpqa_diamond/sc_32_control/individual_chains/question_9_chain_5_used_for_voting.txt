Alright, so I've got this question here about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry stuff, but let's think it through.

Okay, so first, I remember that point groups are used to describe the symmetry of molecules. C3h symmetry... Wait, what's C3h? I think it's one of the dihedral groups. Dihedral groups are like the symmetry elements of a regular polygon. So C3h would have a three-fold rotation axis and a mirror plane or maybe something else. Or wait, no, C3h is actually a point group that includes a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. Or maybe it's a combination of a C3 rotation and a horizontal mirror. I'm a bit confused right now.

Wait, the C3h group. I think it's a symmetry group that has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule should have a three-fold rotational symmetry and also be symmetric with a mirror plane that's horizontal. Or perhaps it's a combination of those elements. Alternatively, maybe it's the group that includes inversion as well, but I'm not too sure. I think I'll need to check that.

So the question gives four options: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, another compound with a long name, and another. The options are labeled A to D.

Let me think about each molecule's structure.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. That's a mouthful. Trifuran suggests three furan rings connected somehow. The substituents are triphenylene groups attached at certain positions. Hmm, furan is a five-membered ring with two double bonds, right? If there are three connected furan rings, perhaps in a symmetric arrangement.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. So similar structure but with benzo groups attached. Benzo would be benzene rings attached at certain positions.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. That's a boron atom connected to three isopropyl groups and an oxygenate group (like O-R). The structure is like [B(OCH2CH(CH3)2)3]. So it's a trigonal planar around boron, but each isopropyl is a bulky group. I think the molecule is symmetrical, but what kind of symmetry? Each isopropyl is the same, so it might have a three-fold axis. But does it have a mirror plane? Let's see, the molecule is symmetric with a central B, and three identical substituents. So if you rotate 120 degrees, it looks the same. So C3 symmetry. But does it have a mirror plane? Hmm, if you look at it from the top, there's a plane of symmetry through the boron and perhaps one of the isopropyl groups. Wait, no, because each is the same, maybe it's higher symmetry. Wait, triisopropyl borate's structure is symmetric. The molecule is trigonal planar, but does it have a mirror plane? I'm not sure. Wait, another thought: triphenyl borate would have a certain symmetry, but triisopropyl... maybe it's C3v symmetry or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's Td or something, but I'm not certain.

Option D: quinuclidine. I know quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, like a cube-shaped amine. Wait, quinuclidine's structure is a bridged bicyclic compound, with a bridgehead nitrogen. The structure is a cube-like, so it's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. What's the symmetry here? I think quinuclidine has a three-fold axis because the molecule is symmetric when rotated 120 degrees. It also has mirror planes. Wait, so quinuclidine's point group is Td, I think. Because it has multiple planes of symmetry and a three-fold rotation axis. Or maybe it's D3h. Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's C3h symmetry.

Wait, point groups: C3h is a dihedral group with a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, perhaps it's the same as D3h but without some elements. Or maybe I should think of the molecule's symmetry operations.

Let me consider each option's structure.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. So, three isopropyl groups attached to a boron atom. The molecule is symmetrical with a three-fold axis through the boron atom. Each isopropyl is the same, so rotating 120 degrees would leave it looking the same. So it definitely has a C3 axis. Now, what about mirror planes? If you have a plane that goes through the boron and one of the isopropyl groups, would that be a mirror plane? Because the molecule is symmetrical when reflected over that plane. Since there are three identical substituents, there are three such planes, each bisecting one isopropyl group. So that would give three mirror planes, each containing the C3 axis. So the point group would be D3h, perhaps? Because D3h has a C3 axis, three mirror planes, and a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, but I'm not sure about the horizontal mirror. Alternatively, maybe the molecule doesn't have a horizontal mirror, but has a vertical mirror. Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with a nitrogen at one bridgehead. Its structure is quite symmetric. The molecule has a three-fold rotation axis, and multiple planes of symmetry. I think its point group is Td, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's D3h as well. Wait, D3h has a C3 axis, three C2 axes perpendicular to it, three mirror planes, and a horizontal mirror plane. If quinuclidine has a plane that's perpendicular to the three-fold axis, then it might have D3h symmetry. But if it only has the C3 axis and some mirrors, perhaps it's D3h. Alternatively, I'm getting confused.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. So, three furan rings connected with benzo substituents. The numbers suggest the positions where the benzene rings are attached. If the molecule has three substituents arranged symmetrically, perhaps it has a three-fold axis. Let me imagine: three benzene rings attached to a central structure in a symmetrical way. Maybe each benzene is at 120-degree positions. So, the molecule could have a C3 axis. But what about mirror planes? If the molecule is such that each substituent is symmetric, then perhaps it has C3 symmetry. But I'm not sure about the mirror planes. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is flat, leading to a higher symmetry.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. This has three triphenylene groups attached. Triphenylene is a fused benzene ring structure. The arrangement could be symmetric. So, maybe each triphenylene is attached in a way that creates a three-fold symmetry. If all three are attached in a symmetrical fashion, the molecule could have a three-fold axis.

Wait, all these options have some kind of three-fold symmetry, maybe. So I need to figure out which one has the mirror plane as well, making it C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a molecule with a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, triisopropyl borate: the structure is a planar with three identical groups around boron. So, when you look along the C3 axis (through B), the substituents are arranged in a trigonal planar fashion. Now, does it have a mirror plane perpendicular to the C3 axis (a vertical plane) or a horizontal plane?

Wait, the mirror plane in C3h symmetry is a horizontal plane. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry that is horizontal, meaning cutting through the molecule in a way that reflects the top and bottom.

Triisopropyl borate, being a flat molecule with the boron in the center and three isopropyl groups, doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane because the molecule is flat—it lies in a plane. Wait, no, the plane of the molecule is itself the horizontal plane. So, if the molecule is in a plane, any reflection across that plane would be a mirror. Hmm, maybe that's a horizontal mirror.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about each option's point group.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. The structure is trigonal planar around boron. Each isopropyl is the same. So the point group is D3h? Because it has a C3 axis, three mirror planes (each containing the C3 axis and one of the substituents), and a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to the C3 axis.

Wait, but triisopropyl borate is a flat molecule, so the plane of the molecule itself is the horizontal mirror. So it does have a horizontal mirror plane. So the point group would be D3h.

But wait, I thought D3h is the point group for something with a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror. So perhaps triisopropyl borate is D3h.

Quinuclidine, on the other hand, has a three-fold axis, but I think it's Td symmetry because it's more symmetrical in 3D. Td has a three-fold axis and multiple other symmetry elements.

Wait, but the question is about C3h symmetry. So which of these molecules falls into C3h?

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again. The point groups: C3h has a three-fold rotation axis (C3), a horizontal mirror plane (σh), and the combination of these gives a three-fold improper rotation (S3). So the elements are E, C3, σh, and S3.

In D3h, the symmetry is higher. It includes not only C3 and σh but also three vertical mirror planes (each containing the C3 axis), and inversion. Alternatively, D3h has more symmetry elements.

So the question is which molecule has exactly the symmetry elements of C3h, not higher. So which of the options lacks the additional symmetry elements beyond C3 and σh.

Looking at the options:

Option C: triisopropyl borate. If it's D3h, that's a higher symmetry than C3h, so the answer isn't this. But wait, if the molecule only has C3 and σh, then it would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, I'm confused. Let me think about the structure of triisopropyl borate. It has a central B connected to three isopropyl groups. The molecule is trigonal planar, so all substituents are in the same plane. So any reflection through that plane would be a mirror. So that would be a horizontal mirror plane. Now, does it have any other mirror planes?

In the structure of triisopropyl borate, each isopropyl is identical. So, if you imagine a mirror plane going through the B and one isopropyl, that would be a vertical mirror. So there are three such vertical mirrors. So the point group would have C3, three σv (vertical mirrors), σh (horizontal mirror), and maybe others. So that's D3h symmetry, which includes more elements than C3h.

Wait, but C3h only includes C3, σh, S3, and E. So if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it would have more elements than C3h. So triisopropyl borate is D3h, so it doesn't have just C3h.

Then, let's look at quinuclidine. If quinuclidine has Td symmetry, that's higher than C3h as well. Td includes four C3 axes, three C2 axes, etc. So it also doesn't fit.

What about the other options, B and A?

Option B: benzo[...]trifuran... It's a trifuran with benzo substituents. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically around a central point, perhaps it has a three-fold axis. If the molecule is flat, maybe it has a horizontal mirror plane. So if it has C3 and σh, then it would be C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps it's D3h again if there are vertical mirror planes.

Option A: triphenyleno[...]trifuran. Similar to B, but with triphenylene groups. I'm not sure if this has a three-fold symmetry.

Wait, I think I need to count the symmetry elements for each.

Option D: quinuclidine. Its structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with a nitrogen. It's symmetric, but I'm not exactly certain about its point group. I think it's Td symmetry because it has multiple planes of symmetry. So that's higher than C3h, so it's not the answer.

So, back to the options, the only one that could have exactly C3h symmetry is either option B or option A.

Let me think about the structures again. Option B: benzo groups attached to a trifuran. If the substituents are arranged in a symmetrical way, each 120 degrees apart, then the molecule would have a C3 axis. If it also has a horizontal mirror plane, then C3h.

But if the molecule is flat, then the plane of the molecule would be the horizontal mirror plane. So if the structure allows for that, then yes.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that it only has C3 and the horizontal mirror, but no vertical mirrors. So the point group would be C3h.

Wait, but for a molecule with three substituents arranged symmetrically, like in a trigonal planar arrangement, it's more likely to have D3h symmetry, which includes vertical mirrors as well. So if a molecule has three substituents arranged symmetrically, it's more likely to have D3h symmetry.

Hmm. So perhaps none of these molecules are exactly C3h. But the question says one of them is. So perhaps I need to think again.

Wait, another approach: C3h symmetry implies that the molecule has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So, the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also be symmetric across a horizontal plane. So, for example, a molecule that is flat (all atoms in one plane) and has three substituents arranged symmetrically.

Wait, triisopropyl borate is flat? The boron is in the center, and the three isopropyl groups are attached. Each isopropyl group is (CH(CH3)2) attached to O. So the molecule is planar around the boron, but each isopropyl group is a three-dimensional structure. So the overall molecule isn't planar, but the arrangement around the boron is trigonal planar. Wait, but the isopropyl groups themselves are in a plane? No, the isopropyl group is a CH2 connected to two CH3 groups. So each isopropyl is like a CH(CH3)2 group attached to O.

Wait, so the entire molecule is not planar. But the central boron is trigonal planar. So, the molecule has a three-fold axis (C3), and if it has a horizontal mirror plane, it would be C3h.

But I'm not sure if the mirror plane exists. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a mirror plane, making it just C3.

Wait, but the question asks about C3h symmetry, which includes the mirror plane.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Another thought: C3h symmetry is found in certain molecules like 1,3,5-trioxane or similar structures with three substituents arranged symmetrically in a plane with a horizontal mirror.

Looking at the options, the third and fourth options (A and B) are more complex with furan rings and substituents. Maybe one of them is flat with substituents arranged symmetrically.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. The structure has three furan rings connected, and each has benzo substituents. The numbering suggests that the substituents are attached in a way that each is in a corner of a triangle. So, the molecule might be flat, with each benzene at 120 degrees from each other. In that case, it would have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, point group C3h.

Alternatively, if the molecule is not flat, it might not have the horizontal mirror.

Wait, furan is a five-membered ring, so connecting three furan rings in a symmetric way could lead to a flat structure. If all three are attached at the same points, maybe the molecule lies in a plane, allowing for a horizontal mirror plane.

If that's the case, the molecule would have a three-fold rotational symmetry and a horizontal mirror, making it C3h.

So, looking at the options, option B is benzo[...] and option A is triphenyleno.

Wait, another approach: the third option is benzo-trifuran, the fourth is triphenyleno-trifuran.

I think the triphenyleno version might have more substituents that could break the symmetry. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B. Because the benzo groups are attached symmetrically, leading to C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, if the molecule is flat, then it's probably C3h.

Wait, another thought: the presence of a horizontal mirror plane. A horizontal mirror plane would require that the top and bottom of the molecule are mirror images. So if the molecule is flat, the plane of the molecule is the horizontal mirror.

So, if a molecule is flat and has a three-fold rotational symmetry, it would have C3h.

So, which of the options is flat?

Triisopropyl borate: the boron is in the center, with three isopropyl groups. The isopropyl groups are not flat, but the boron is in a trigonal planar arrangement. So the molecule is not flat, but the central part is.

The other options: the furan-based molecules are likely to be flat, given that furan is a planar ring. So if three furan rings are connected symmetrically, the whole molecule would be flat. So, the molecule would have a horizontal mirror plane.

So, in that case, the molecule would have C3h symmetry.

So, looking at the options, which options are flat?

Options B and A are both trifuran derivatives, so they are flat.

Which of these would have C3h symmetry?

Benzo has three benzene rings attached. Triphenyleno also has three substituents. So, both are symmetric.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Let me think: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Looking at the substituents: each triphenylene is attached to a position in the trifuran. Triphenylene is a fused benzene ring; it's a planar structure. If the substituents are attached symmetrically at each corner of the trifuran, the molecule would have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about how the substituents are attached. For example, in option B, the benzo groups are attached at positions 1,2-c; 3,4-c'; 5,6-c''. So each benzene is attached to different positions on the trifuran, perhaps leading to a more symmetric arrangement.

Alternatively, the key is that in C3h symmetry, the molecule must have a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, no, looking at the options again. The question is to choose which molecule has C3h symmetry.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the point groups of each molecule.

Triisopropyl borate: D3h symmetry. So not C3h.

Quinuclidine: Td symmetry. So not C3h.

Option B: benzo[...]trifuran.

If the substituents are arranged in a symmetric way, and the molecule is flat, then it would have C3h symmetry.

So, I think the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Wait, the numbering suggests that the ketone groups are at positions 1,3,4,6,7,9. Hmm, maybe that's a bit complicated. But regardless, the structure is such that the three substituents are symmetric.

So, I think the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry elements. **C₃h** symmetry consists of a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σᵦ). The molecule must appear identical after a 120° rotation and must also be symmetric across a horizontal plane.

### Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
- This molecule consists of three triphenylene groups attached to a trifuran core. Triphenylene is a planar fused benzene structure, and the trifuran core is also planar. If the triphenylene groups are symmetrically arranged at 120° intervals, the molecule has a three-fold rotational axis (C₃). 
- However, the presence of additional substituents or asymmetries in the triphenylene groups could break the symmetry, making it unlikely to have a horizontal mirror plane (σᵦ). Thus, this molecule does not clearly exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

#### **Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
- This molecule has three benzo groups attached to a trifuran core. The trifuran core is planar, and the benzo groups are likely arranged symmetrically at 120° intervals. This arrangement gives the molecule a three-fold rotational axis (C₃).
- Additionally, the molecule lies in a plane, making the plane of the molecule itself a horizontal mirror plane (σᵦ). Therefore, this molecule satisfies the requirements for **C₃h** symmetry.

#### **Option C: Triisopropyl Borate**
- This molecule has a boron atom at the center, bonded to three identical isopropyl groups. The trigonal planar arrangement around boron gives the molecule a three-fold rotational axis (C₃). However, the molecule is not flat, and the isopropyl groups introduce asymmetry, preventing the existence of a horizontal mirror plane (σᵦ). Thus, it does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

#### **Option D: Quinuclidine**
- Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bridged structure and a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead. While it has a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and multiple planes of symmetry, its complex three-dimensional structure and additional symmetry elements (e.g., vertical mirror planes) make it belong to the **Td** point group, not **C₃h**.

### Conclusion:
The molecule that exhibits **C₃h** symmetry is **Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**, as it has a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

**Answer: B**
