Okay, so I have this astronomy problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a star with some dark spots and how the brightness variations caused by these spots compare to those caused by an exoplanet. The goal is to find the radius of the exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spots.

Alright, let's break down the problem. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so R_star = R_sun. The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K, so their temperature is 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K, I guess.

When the star rotates, these spots come into and out of view from our perspective, causing the observed brightness to dip periodically. Similarly, an exoplanet transiting in front of the star would block some light, causing a dip too. The question is asking what size (radius) of planet would cause the same dip in brightness as the spots do.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the photometric variations are due to the spots, but if we ignore the spots (the "if the star was not covered by spots" part), what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve.

So, I need to compute the relative brightness change (delta F / F) caused by the spots and the planet, then set them equal and solve for R_planet / R_star.

Let me think about the brightness variation from the spots first.

The star emits a certain amount of flux. When part of its surface is cooler (spots), that part contributes less flux. The total flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the spotted area and the unspotted area.

But wait, since it's a hemisphere covered, the area covered is half the star's surface. But the filling factor is 20%, which means that 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered by spots. So the total spotted area is 0.2 * (pi R^2) because a hemisphere is half the sphere, so area is 2 * pi R^2 for the full sphere—wait, no. Wait, the surface area of a sphere is 4 pi R^2. So a hemisphere is 2 pi R^2. So the total area of the hemisphere is 2 pi R^2. The filling factor is 20%, so the area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2 pi R^2) = 0.4 pi R^2.

Wait, but in reality, the spots are on one hemisphere, so the maximum coverage is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * (2 pi R^2) = 0.4 pi R^2. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then move away, causing a dip in brightness.

But the star emits flux based on the temperature. The total flux without any spots is F_total = sigma * Teff^4 * (4 pi R^2) / (4 pi d^2), but wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the star's luminosity. But perhaps a better approach is to compute the fraction of the star's flux that is blocked or reduced due to the spots.

Alternatively, let's model the change in flux due to the spots. When a spot is on the surface, it contributes less flux. The difference between the star's flux and spot's flux is what affects the observed brightness.

When the spots are on the visible hemisphere, they reduce the total flux. The amount of flux reduction depends on the area of the spots and their temperature.

The flux from the star without spots is F0 = sigma * Teff^4 * (4 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2), but since we're dealing with relative changes, maybe we can ignore the distances and just focus on the relative areas and temperatures.

Wait, the star's total flux F0 is proportional to the surface area times the flux per unit area. The flux per unit area (sigma T^4) depends on temperature. So the star's total flux is F0 = (sigma T_eff^4) * (4 pi R^2) / (4 pi) — wait, no, the 4 pi comes from the surface area of the sphere, but when viewed from Earth, the flux is integrated over the visible hemisphere. Hmm, perhaps I should model the flux more carefully.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the flux as the sum of the unspotted and spotted regions.

The star's total flux without spots is F0 = sigma * Teff^4 * 4 pi R^2 / (4 pi D^2) ) = sigma Teff^4 R^2 / D^2.

Wait, actually, the flux from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4 pi R^2 sigma T^4. But when observed from a distance D, the flux we receive is F = L/(4 pi D^2) = R^2 sigma T^4 / D^2.

Wait no, wait. L = 4 pi R^2 sigma T^4. So F = L/(4 pi D^2) = (4 pi R^2 sigma T^4) / (4 pi D^2) ) = (R^2 sigma T^4) / D^2.

So F0 = (R^2 sigma Teff^4 ) / D^2.

But when spots are present, the flux is F = F0 - (flux lost due to spots).

The spots are cooler, so each spot emits less. The area of spots is A_spots = filling factor * hemisphere area. Wait, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So A_spots = 0.2 * (2 pi R^2) ) = 0.4 pi R^2.

Each spot's area contributes sigma T_spot^4 to the flux. So the flux from the spots is A_spots * sigma T_spot^4.

Wait, but when the spots are on the hemisphere facing us, their flux is F_spots = A_spots * sigma T_spot^4.

But wait, the total flux from the star without spots is F0 = sigma Teff^4 * (4 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2) ) = (sigma Teff^4 R^2 ) / D^2. Because 4 pi R^2 is the surface area, and F = L/(4 pi D^2).

Wait, maybe a different approach is better. The relative change in flux when the spots are visible is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots multiplied by the relative brightness difference between the spotted and unspotted regions.

Wait, perhaps the fractional change in flux (delta F / F0) is equal to the area of the spots (as a fraction of the star's surface) multiplied by (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)).

Wait, because each spot's area contributes less flux. So the total flux when spots are present is F = F0 * [ (1 - f) * 1 + f * (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) ] where f is the filling factor.

Wait, no. Let me think: each part of the star's surface contributes to the flux. The unspotted area is (1 - f) of the hemisphere, but wait, the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star isn't rotating, we see a certain amount of spots.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's model the maximum dip in brightness when the entire spotted hemisphere is facing us, but since the spots are only 20% of that hemisphere, the dip would be based on the area of the spots.

Alternatively, since the star is rotating and only one hemisphere is spotty, the maximum effect is when the spotty hemisphere is fully visible. So the area of the spots is as a fraction of the star's surface, which is (0.2 * 2 pi R^2) ) / (4 pi R^2) ) = (0.4 pi R^2) / (4 pi R^2) ) = 0.1. So 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots.

Wait, wait, that calculation would be the case if the spots were spread over the entire star. But no, the problem states that one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the total area of the spots is 0.2 * (2 pi R^2) ) = 0.4 pi R^2.

The total area of the star is 4 pi R^2. So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (0.4 pi R^2) / (4 pi R^2) ) = 0.1, 10%.

So f = 0.1 is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots.

But when the star rotates, only the spotted hemisphere is visible. Wait, no, because it's a rotating star, the hemisphere that's facing us changes. So when the star is viewed from Earth, the spotted hemisphere will rotate into view and out of view, causing the observed brightness to dip when spots are in front.

But wait, the maximum dip occurs when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible. So the area contributing to the dip is 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, but the star is viewed as a disk. The flux is proportional to the area covered by the cooler regions. So the fractional change in flux (delta F / F0) is equal to (fraction of area covered by spots) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)).

So delta F / F0 = f * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

Let me compute this. Given f = 0.1, T_spot = 5000 K, T_eff = 6000 K.

So T_ratio = 5000 / 6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

T_ratio^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.482.

So 1 - T_ratio^4 ≈ 0.518.

So delta F / F0 = 0.1 * 0.518 = 0.0518 or about 5.18% dip.

Wait, but wait. Because the spots are on one hemisphere, when the star rotates, we see the other hemisphere (unspotted) when the spots are on the far side. So the brightness should vary based on how much of the spotted area is visible.

Wait, no. Because the star is rotating, the spots come into view as the star rotates. But the maximum dip is when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, that 10% of the star's surface (spots) contribute less flux.

So the maximum dip is 5.18% of the star's flux.

Wait, but wait, maybe the calculation is correct. So the delta F is 0.0518 F0.

Now, the exoplanet's effect: when it transits in front of the star, it blocks some of the star's light. The dip in flux is approximately the area of the planet's disk relative to the star's disk.

The area of the planet is pi R_planet^2, and the area of the star is pi R_star^2. So the fractional dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

So we need to find R_planet such that (R_planet / R_star)^2 ≈ 0.0518.

So R_p / R_s = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ sqrt(0.05) ≈ 0.2236.

Wait, more accurately:

0.0518 = (Rp/Rs)^2 → Rp/Rs = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2278.

But wait, the options don't have 0.2278. Let me check the options.

Looking back, options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32.

Hmm. None of these match 0.2278. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait a second, perhaps the way I calculated the spots' effect is incorrect. Let me re-examine.

The problem says the star has a radius equal to the Sun, and the spots are on one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20% (so area 0.2 of the hemisphere). So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2 pi R^2) = 0.4 pi R^2.

The area of the entire star is 4 pi R^2, so the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 0.4 pi R^2 / 4 pi R^2 = 0.1, or 10%.

But when the star rotates, the spots come into view. So when the star is viewed from Earth, the spots will cover a part of the star's disk. So the maximum dip occurs when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible.

Wait, no, the star is a sphere, and the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the side with spots comes into view, the other side is the unspotted. So the maximum area of spots we can see is 0.4 pi R^2, but wait, no. Because the hemisphere is 2 pi R^2, and the spots are 0.2 of that. So when the hemisphere is facing us, the spots are 0.4 pi R^2 in area. So the fractional area is 0.4 pi R^2 / (4 pi R^2) ) = 0.1.

Wait, but that's the same conclusion as before. So the dip is 5.18% when the spots are fully visible.

But the exoplanet's dip is (Rp/Rs)^2, so we have Rp/Rs = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2278.

But the options are all in the 0.07, 0.11, 0.32, 0.39 range. So 0.227 is not among them. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should think about the photometric variation as the star rotates, considering the spots on one hemisphere. So the star's brightness variation is due to the change in the visible area of the spots as the star rotates. Wait, but the problem states that the star has one hemisphere covered, so when it rotates, the spots come into view and block the light, causing a dip.

Wait, perhaps I should model the maximum dip as when the entire spot area is in front of us. So the dip is f_spot * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)), as before. So 0.1 * 0.518 ≈ 0.0518.

But the exoplanet's dip is when it transits, so the dip is (Rp / R*)^2.

So, to get the same dip, the planet must have (Rp / R*)^2 = 0.0518. So Rp / R* = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2278, which is approximately 0.23. But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made an error in the spot calculation.

Alternatively, maybe the spot calculation is different. Let me consider that the star's surface is divided into two hemispheres, each with an area of 2 pi R^2. One hemisphere has spots covering 20% of its area, so 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2. So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the spots cover 0.4 pi R^2, which is 0.4 pi / 4 pi = 0.1, or 10% of the entire star's surface. So the maximum dip is 10% of the star's flux being reduced by the spots.

Wait, but the star's flux is proportional to the sum of the flux from spotted and unspotted areas. So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the total flux is:

F = (Area_unspotted * sigma T_eff^4 ) + (Area_spotted * sigma T_spot^4 )

= [ (1 - 0.1) * 4 pi R^2 ] * sigma T_eff^4 / (4 pi D^2) ) + [0.1 * 4 pi R^2 ] * sigma T_spot^4 / (4 pi D^2) )

Wait no, because the spotted area is 0.1 of the star's surface. So the total flux when the spots are visible would be:

F = (1 - 0.1) * sigma T_eff^4 * R^2 / D^2 + 0.1 * sigma T_spot^4 * R^2 / D^2

= sigma R^2 / D^2 [ 0.9 T_eff^4 + 0.1 T_spot^4 ]

The original flux without any spots would be F0 = sigma T_eff^4 R^2 / D^2.

So the ratio F / F0 = 0.9 + 0.1 (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )

So the fractional change is delta F/F0 = F - F0 = F0 ( [0.9 + 0.1 (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) ] -1 )

= F0 ( -0.1 + 0.1 (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) )

= F0 * 0.1 ( T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 - 1 )

Which is the same as before. So this approach is correct.

So delta F/F0 = 0.1 * ( (5000/6000)^4 - 1 ) / 1.

Wait, no: 0.1 * ( (5000/6000)^4 - 1 ) = 0.1 * ( (5/6)^4 - 1 )

Wait, (5/6)^4 is approximately 0.482, so 0.482 -1 = -0.518.

So delta F/F0 = 0.1 * (-0.518) = -0.0518.

So the dip is about 5.18% of the original flux.

Now, the exoplanet scenario: when the planet transits, the dip is (Rp/R*)^2.

So we set (Rp/R*)^2 = 0.0518 → Rp/R* = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2278, which is approximately 0.23. But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the options include 0.32 (option D) and 0.11 (option C). Let me think again. Wait, maybe I should consider that the planet's transit causes a dip in brightness when it moves in front of the star, but the star's spots cause a dip when the spots are on the near side. But the problem says the star's brightness variation is due to rotational modulation (so spots are rotating into view), and this situation can resemble an exoplanet.

So perhaps the amplitude of the brightness variation is what we should compare. So the star's variation is the dip due to the spots, which is 5.18% as calculated. The planet's variation is (Rp/R*)^2. So to have the same amplitude, (Rp/R*)^2 = 0.0518 → Rp/R* ≈ 0.2278. But that's not among the options.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the spot calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K. The filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere, so the area is 0.2 * (2 pi R^2) )= 0.4 pi R^2. But when the star is viewed from Earth, only one hemisphere is visible at a time. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots, but when it rotates, the unspotted hemisphere comes into view.

Wait, but the star's flux without spots is based on the entire surface, while when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is based on the unspotted part of that hemisphere and the spotted part. Hmm, perhaps I should model it differently.

Wait, perhaps the star's brightness when the spotty hemisphere is visible is F = (unspotted part of the hemisphere) * sigma T_eff^4 + (spotted part) * sigma T_spot^4.

But the unspotted part of the hemisphere is 80% of the hemisphere, since the filling factor is 20%. So the unspotted area on the visible hemisphere is 0.8 * 2 pi R^2 = 1.6 pi R^2.

The spotted area is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

So the total flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is:

F = (1.6 pi R^2) * sigma T_eff^4 + (0.4 pi R^2) * sigma T_spot^4.

The original flux (without any spots) would be when the entire star is at T_eff, so F0 = 4 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4.

So the ratio F / F0 = [ (1.6 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4 ) + (0.4 pi R^2 sigma T_spot^4) ] / (4 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [1.6 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4 + 0.4 pi R^2 sigma T_spot^4 ] / (4 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4 )

Cancel out terms:

= [1.6 T_eff^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 ] / (4 T_eff^4 )

= (1.6 + 0.4 (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) / 4

= (1.6 + 0.4 (5000^4/6000^4 )) /4

Compute 5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(5/6)^4 ≈ 625/1296 ≈ 0.4823.

So 0.4 * 0.4823 ≈ 0.1929.

So numerator becomes 1.6 + 0.1929 ≈ 1.7929.

Divide by 4: 1.7929 /4 ≈ 0.4482.

So F = 0.4482 F0. So the flux when spots are visible is 44.82% of F0? That can't be right because the star is emitting less when spots are visible, so F should be less than F0. Wait, but the calculation gives F = 0.4482 F0, which is less than F0, so the dip would be 1 - 0.4482 = 0.5518, or 55.18% dip. That's a much larger dip than before, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, that can't be correct, because 1.6 is 80% of 2 pi R^2, but 4 pi R^2 is the whole star. So perhaps I should model it differently. Maybe the F when the spotty hemisphere is visible is the sum of the unspotted part (80% of the hemisphere) and the spotted part (20% of the hemisphere).

But if the star's entire surface emits F0, and when the spotty hemisphere is visible, we see 80% of that hemisphere's area at T_eff and 20% at T_spot.

So the flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is:

F = ( (1 - f) * A_hemi + f * A_hemi * (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) * sigma T_eff^4 / (4 pi D^2 )

Wait, perhaps I should express everything in terms of the star's total flux.

Total flux without spots: F0 = sigma T_eff^4 * (4 pi R^2) / (4 pi D^2 ) = sigma T_eff^4 R^2 / D^2.

When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

F = [ (1 - f) * (2 pi R^2) * sigma T_eff^4 + f * (2 pi R^2) * sigma T_spot^4 ] / (4 pi D^2 )

= [ 2 pi R^2 sigma ( (1-f) T_eff^4 + f T_spot^4 ) ] / (4 pi D^2 )

= [ R^2 sigma ( (1-f) T_eff^4 + f T_spot^4 ) ] / ( 2 D^2 )

So, F = ( R^2 sigma T_eff^4 )/(2 D^2 ) * [ (1 -f ) + f ( T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) ]

But F0 = ( R^2 sigma T_eff^4 ) / D^2.

So F = (F0 / 2 ) * [ (1 - f ) + f ( T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) ]

So the fractional flux is F / F0 = [ (1 - f ) + f ( T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) ] / 2.

Ah, that makes more sense. Because when the spotty hemisphere is visible, it's only half the star's surface we're seeing (the hemisphere), so the flux is half the sum of the entire star's flux. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the flux from the visible hemisphere when it's the spotty one, and compare it to the flux when the unspotty hemisphere is visible.

When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

F_spotty_hemi = (1 - f) * (2 pi R^2) * sigma T_eff^4 + f * (2 pi R^2) * sigma T_spot^4.

When the unspotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

F_unspotty_hemi = 2 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4.

So the average flux would be the average of these two, but the brightness variation is the difference between F_unspotty_hemi and F_spotty_hemi.

Wait, because the star rotates, when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotty_hemi, and when the unspotty is visible, it's F_unspotty_hemi. So the maximum dip occurs when F_spotty_hemi is observed.

So delta F = F_unspotty_hemi - F_spotty_hemi.

Which is:

delta F = [ 2 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4 ] - [ (1-f) * 2 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4 + f * 2 pi R^2 sigma T_spot^4 ]

= 2 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4 [ 1 - (1-f) - f ( T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) ]

= 2 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4 [ f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) ]

So delta F = 2 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4 f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

The original flux F0 is (sigma T_eff^4 4 pi R^2 ) / (4 pi D^2 ) ) = sigma T_eff^4 R^2 / D^2.

Wait, perhaps better to compute the fractional change.

delta F / F0 = [ 2 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4 f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) ] / ( sigma T_eff^4 R^2 / D^2 )

Wait, no, because F0 is the flux when no spots are present. But when the star is viewed from Earth, it's the average of the two hemispheres. Wait, maybe I'm getting tangled up.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum dip is when the spotty hemisphere is directly facing us. So the flux is F_spotty_hemi, and the average without spots would be F_unspotty_hemi = 2 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4.

Wait, perhaps the dip is (F_unspotty_hemi - F_spotty_hemi)/F_unspotty_hemi.

But F_unspotty_hemi is 2 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4.

F_spotty_hemi = (1-f)*2 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4 + f * 2 pi R^2 sigma T_spot^4.

So dip = [ F_unspotty_hemi - F_spotty_hemi ] / F_unspotty_hemi.

= [ 2 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4 - ( (1-f) 2 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4 + f 2 pi R^2 sigma T_spot^4 ) ] / ( 2 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4 )

= [ 2 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4 [1 - (1-f) - f (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) ] ] / ( 2 pi R^2 sigma T_eff^4 )

= [ f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) ].

So dip = f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

Which brings us back to the earlier calculation.

With f=0.1, T_spot=5000 K, Teff=6000 K.

So dip ≈ 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.1 * (1 - 0.482) ≈ 0.1 * 0.518 = 0.0518.

So same as before. So dip is about 5.18% of F0.

So for the exoplanet, dip is (Rp/R*)^2.

Set (Rp/R*)^2 = 0.0518 → Rp/R* ≈ 0.2278.

But the options don't have this. The closest option is D) 0.32, but that's larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the dip. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps the filling factor is not 0.1. Because the star's radius is equal to the Sun's, and the area of the spots is 20% of a hemisphere.

So the area of a hemisphere is 2 pi R^2.

The area of spots is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

The total surface area of the star is 4 pi R^2.

So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 0.4 pi R^2 / 4 pi R^2 = 0.1 or 10%.

But when the star rotates, the spotty hemisphere comes into view, so the observed area of the spots is 10% of the star's surface. So the dip is 10% of the star's area, each spot being cooler.

So the dip is 0.1 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) = 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.0518.

So same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it as (Rp/R*) = sqrt(dip) → sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2278. So 0.2278 is about 0.23, which is approximately 0.23. Looking at the options, option D is 0.32, which is larger. Option C is 0.11, which is smaller.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the dip is 5.18%, and the planet's dip is (Rp/R*)^2 = 5.18% → Rp/R* = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2278, which is 0.228.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another possibility: the problem says that the star has an effective temperature of 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So the spots' temperature is 5000 K.

But when calculating the fractional change in flux, perhaps the formula is (Area_spots / Area_star) * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff )^4 ).

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (Area_spots / Area_visible_hemi) * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff )^4 ).

Wait, because when the star rotates, the spots are on the visible hemisphere, so the area of the spots as a fraction of the visible area is (0.4 pi R^2) / (2 pi R^2) ) = 0.2 or 20%.

So the fractional change would be 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.2 * 0.518 = 0.1036 or about 10.36% dip.

Wait, that's a much larger dip. Let me see where that comes from.

Wait, perhaps when the star's visible hemisphere is the spotty one, the area of the spots is 0.4 pi R^2, and the visible area is 2 pi R^2. So the fraction is 0.4 pi R^2 / 2 pi R^2 = 0.2.

So the dip would be 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.2 * 0.518 ≈ 0.1036.

So the dip is about 10.36%.

Then, the exoplanet's dip is (Rp/R*)^2 = 0.1036 → Rp/R* = sqrt(0.1036) ≈ 0.322.

Which is approximately 0.32, which is option D.

Ah, so this makes sense. So perhaps the mistake was in considering the area of the spots relative to the entire star's surface, but actually, when the star is viewed from Earth, only the visible hemisphere is seen. So the fraction of the visible area covered by spots is 20% (0.2), not 10% of the entire star.

So the dip calculation should be based on the fraction of the visible hemisphere covered by spots.

So the dip would be 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.2 * 0.518 ≈ 0.1036.

So the planet's dip is (Rp/R*)^2 = 0.1036 → Rp/R* ≈ 0.322, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the star's dark spots, we analyze the photometric effects caused by both the spots and the planet.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \)
   - Effective Temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \)
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Temperature of spots: \( T_{\text{spot}} = T_{\text{eff}} - 1000 \, \text{K} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation from Spots**:
   - The area of the star's surface covered by spots is 20% of the visible hemisphere.
   - Fraction of the visible hemisphere covered by spots: \( f = 0.2 \).
   - The fractional change in flux due to the spots is given by:
     \[
     \Delta F / F_0 = f \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right)
     \]
   - Substituting values:
     \[
     \Delta F / F_0 = 0.2 \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right)
     \]
     \[
     \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \approx 0.482 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \Delta F / F_0 = 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.482) = 0.2 \cdot 0.518 = 0.1036
     \]
   - Thus, the fractional brightness variation due to the spots is approximately \( 10.36\% \).

3. **Brightness Variation from an Exoplanet**:
   - When an exoplanet transits the star, the fractional brightness variation is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius:
     \[
     \Delta F / F_0 = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
     \]
   - To match the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, we set:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1036
     \]
   - Solving for \( R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1036} \approx 0.322
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.32 \). This matches option **D**.
