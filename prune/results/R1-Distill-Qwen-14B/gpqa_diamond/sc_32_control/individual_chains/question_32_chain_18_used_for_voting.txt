Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and figuring out the energy of the nuclei being accelerated. The question says that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. I need to find the energy from the given options.

First, I need to understand what nucleus X is. The problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, wait. Lithium usually has 3 protons. So, if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because protons plus neutrons give the mass number. So Li-6 has 6 nucleons in total? Wait, no. Wait, Li normally has atomic number 3. So 3 protons. If it's Li with 3 neutrons, that's 3 + 3 =6, so Li-6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

Next, I need to calculate the energy of these nuclei when they're moving at 0.96c. I remember that in relativistic physics, the energy of a particle is given by the total energy formula, which includes the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. The formula is E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is calculated as 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let me plug that in.

So, v = 0.96c. So, v² is (0.96)^2 * c². Let me compute 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.9216. So v²/c² is 0.9216.

Then, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, let's see, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

So gamma = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.57142857... Wait, let me compute that accurately. 1 divided by 0.28. So 0.28 is 28/100, which is 7/25. So 1/(7/25) =25/7 ≈3.57142857.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6. The atomic mass of Li-6 needs to be found. Wait, I think the atomic mass is approximately the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons. Each proton is about 938 MeV/c², same for neutrons. So Li has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So total rest mass energy would be 6 * 938 MeV. Wait, but wait, that's the sum of individual particles, but when they form a nucleus, there's a mass defect due to binding energy. But in particle physics, when using the rest mass of the nucleus, it's the atomic mass. So perhaps I should look up the exact atomic mass of Li-6.

Wait, I don't have the exact value, but perhaps I can approximate. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the sum of the masses of the nucleons without considering binding energy. Wait, but that might not be accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem provides the mass of the nucleus as Li-6, but I'm not given that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can proceed with the given information. Let me think; perhaps the problem expects using the rest mass of a single nucleon as 938 MeV/c² and then multiply by the number of nucleons. But that's an approximation.

Wait, the actual atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0176 * 931 MeV (wait, wait, 1 u is about 931 MeV/c²). Let me compute that.

So 6.0176 u * 931 MeV/u ≈ 6.0176 * 931 ≈ let's compute that.

6 * 931 =5586 MeV

0.0176 *931 ≈ let's approximate.

0.01 *931=9.31; 0.0076 *931= approx 7.07. So total for 0.0176 is about 16.38. So total mass is approximately 5586 +16.38= 5602.38 MeV.

Wait, but wait, 6.0176 u is the mass of Li-6. So 6.0176 *931 = let me compute that more accurately.

Compute 6 *931 = 5586.

0.0176 *931: 0.01 *931=9.31; 0.0076*931= (0.007 *931)=6.517 and 0.0006*931=0.5586. So 6.517 +0.5586=7.0756.

So 9.31 +7.0756=16.3856.

So 5586 +16.3856=5602.3856 MeV. So that's approximately 5602.3856 MeV, which is 5.6023856 GeV. So m0 c² is about 5.6024 GeV.

Wait, but wait, this is the rest energy of the nucleus. So E = gamma * m0 c².

Gamma is approximately 3.5714, so E = 3.5714 * 5.6024 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3 times 5.6024 is 16.8072. 0.5714 *5.6024 is approximately, well, 0.5 *5.6024=2.8012. And 0.0714 *5.6024 ≈0.4011. So adding 2.8012 +0.4011=3.2023. So total E is about 16.8072 +3.2023=20.0095 GeV.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. 3.5714 multiplied by 5.6024.

Let me compute 3.5714 *5.6024.

3 *5.6024=16.8072.

0.5714 *5.6024: let's compute 0.5 *5.6024=2.8012.

0.0714 *5.6024: Let me compute 5.6024 × 0.07 = 0.392168; 0.0014 ×5.6024=0.00784336. So total about 0.392168 +0.00784336=0.40001136.

So adding 2.8012 +0.40001136=3.20121136.

Total E=16.8072+3.20121136=20.008411 GeV.

So approximately 20.0084 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made an approximation in the mass. Let me check if I used the correct rest mass.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem uses the rest mass of a single proton as 938 MeV and a neutron as 940 MeV, but that's an approximation. Alternatively, maybe the exact mass is given, but it's not provided in the question, so perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass of the nucleus as approximately 6 * 938 =5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

If m0 c² is 5.628 GeV, then E=3.5714 *5.628.

Compute that: 3 *5.628=16.884.

0.5714 *5.628 ≈ 3.208 (because 0.5 *5.628=2.814; 0.0714 *5.628≈0.403. 2.814+0.403=3.217).

So total E≈ 16.884+3.217=20.101 GeV.

Which is about 20.101 GeV, which matches option C (20.132 GeV) pretty closely. But wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, I approximated gamma as 3.5714. Let me compute gamma again.

v=0.96c.

1 - v²/c² = 1 - (0.96)^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So 1/0.28 is exactly 3.57142857...

So gamma is exactly 25/7, which is approximately 3.57142857.

So accurate.

Now, another approach: Maybe I should use the exact rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus.

The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.017152534 u. So 6.017152534 u multiplied by 931.494 MeV/u gives the rest mass energy.

Wait, let me compute that.

6.017152534 * 931.494 MeV.

First, compute 6 *931.494=5588.964 MeV.

0.017152534 *931.494 ≈ let's compute:

0.01 *931.494=9.31494

0.007152534 *931.494 ≈ compute 0.007 *931.494=6.520458; 0.000152534 *931.494≈0.14204.

So 6.520458 +0.14204≈6.6625.

So 9.31494 +6.6625 ≈15.9774 MeV.

So total m0 c²=5588.964 +15.9774=5604.9414 MeV=5.6049414 GeV.

So m0 c² ≈5.6049414 GeV.

Now, E = gamma * m0 c².

gamma=3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 *5.6049414 = ?

Let me compute this accurately.

3.57142857 *5.6049414.

Break it down:

3 *5.6049414 =16.8148242.

0.57142857 *5.6049414.

Compute 0.5 *5.6049414 =2.8024707.

0.07142857 *5.6049414. Let me compute 5.6049414 *0.07142857.

0.07142857 is approximately 1/14. So 5.6049414 /14 ≈0.400353.

So 0.07142857 *5.6049414 ≈0.400353.

So 2.8024707 +0.400353≈3.2028237.

So total E =16.8148242 +3.2028237≈20.0176479 GeV.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately without approximating.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6049414.

I can split 3.57142857 into 3 + 0.5 + 0.07142857.

So 3 *5.6049414 =16.8148242.

0.5 *5.6049414=2.8024707.

0.07142857 *5.6049414.

Let me compute 5.6049414 *0.07142857.

Since 0.07142857 is 1/14, 5.6049414 * (1/14) ≈0.400353.

So adding the three parts: 16.8148242 +2.8024707=19.6172949 +0.400353=20.0176479 GeV.

So E≈20.0176 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher.

Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass.

Wait, the exact value of Li-6's mass is 6.017152534 u.

Wait, 6.017152534 *931.494 MeV/u.

So 6 *931.494=5588.964 MeV.

0.017152534 *931.494 = let's compute precisely.

0.01 *931.494=9.31494.

0.007152534 *931.494.

Let me compute 0.007*931.494=6.520458.

0.000152534 *931.494= approx 0.000152534 *900=0.13728, and 0.000152534 *31.494≈0.00482. So total ≈0.1421.

So 6.520458 +0.1421=6.662558.

So 9.31494 +6.662558=15.977498 MeV.

So total mass energy is 5588.964 +15.977498=5604.9415 MeV=5.6049415 GeV.

So E=gamma * m0 c²=3.57142857 *5.6049415 GeV.

Let me compute this product accurately.

3.57142857 *5.6049415.

Let me write it as:

3.57142857 = 25/7.

So 25/7 *5.6049415 = (25 *5.6049415)/7.

25 *5.6049415 =140.1235375.

Divide by 7: 140.1235375 /7 =20.01764821 GeV.

So E≈20.0176 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. So why the discrepancy? Did I miscalculate?

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is taken as the sum of the individual masses of the nucleons without considering binding energy. Let me compute that.

Each proton is 938.272 MeV (approx), and each neutron is about 939.565 MeV.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So total rest mass would be 3*(938.272 +939.565) MeV.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, each proton is 938.272 MeV, each neutron 939.565 MeV.

So 3 protons: 3 *938.272 =2814.816 MeV.

3 neutrons:3 *939.565=2818.695 MeV.

Total: 2814.816 +2818.695=5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

So m0 c²=5.633511 GeV.

Now, gamma is 3.57142857.

So E=3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Compute 3 *5.633511=16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511.

0.5 *5.633511=2.8167555.

0.07142857 *5.633511 ≈0.40467 (since 5.633511 *0.07142857≈0.40467).

So 2.8167555 +0.40467=3.2214255.

Adding to 16.900533 gives 20.121958 GeV.

So E≈20.122 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but earlier when I used the exact atomic mass, I got around 20.0176 GeV, but when using the sum of individual proton and neutron masses, I get about 20.122 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the sum of individual masses, not considering the binding energy. Because in high-energy physics, sometimes they approximate the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the individual nucleons because the binding energy is much smaller than the rest mass.

Wait, but the binding energy of Li-6 is about 6 * binding energy per nucleon. The binding energy per nucleon for light nuclei can be roughly estimated. For example, for helium-4, it's about 28 MeV. For lithium, maybe around 10 MeV per nucleon. So 6 *10=60 MeV, which is 0.06 GeV. So the rest mass using the sum would be higher by about 0.06 GeV. So 5.628 GeV (sum) vs 5.604 GeV (exact), which is a difference of about 0.024 GeV. So the exact calculation gives about 20 GeV, the sum gives 20.122 GeV.

Given the options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV, which is very close to 20.122 GeV.

Wait, but why the discrepancy? Let me recompute.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing gamma. Let me compute gamma again.

v=0.96c.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass used in the problem is 6 *938 MeV, which would be 5.628 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.628 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.628.

3 *5.628=16.884.

0.57142857 *5.628.

0.5 *5.628=2.814.

0.07142857 *5.628 ≈0.403.

Adding 2.814+0.403=3.217.

So total E=16.884+3.217=20.101 GeV.

So about 20.101 GeV. So option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher.

But why is there a difference? Maybe I should compute 3.57142857 *5.628 exactly.

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.628.

Another approach: 3.57142857 multiplied by 5.628.

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.628 = ?

Let me break 5.628 into 5 + 0.6 + 0.02 +0.008.

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.02=0.0714285714.

3.57142857 ×0.008=0.02857142856.

Adding all together: 17.85714285 +2.142857142=20.0, plus 0.0714285714=20.07142857, plus 0.02857142856=20.10000000 GeV.

So exactly 20.1 GeV.

So, 3.57142857 ×5.628=20.1 GeV. So E=20.1 GeV.

But option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's a bit of a difference. So perhaps the calculation using the exact sum is 20.1 GeV, which is not exactly any option. Or perhaps the problem expects rounding to three decimal places.

Wait, the options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419

Wait, my calculation using the sum of individual masses gives E=20.1 GeV. But option C is 20.132, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the rest mass, like 5.62 GeV or similar.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the exact atomic mass of Li-6, which is 6.017152534 u.

So, 6.017152534 u × 931.494 MeV/u = ?

Let me compute that without approximations.

6.017152534 ×931.494.

Let me compute 6 ×931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.017152534 ×931.494.

Let me compute 0.017152534 ×931.494.

Compute 0.01 ×931.494=9.31494.

0.007 ×931.494=6.520458.

0.000152534 ×931.494 ≈0.1421.

So 9.31494 +6.520458=15.835398 +0.1421=15.9775 MeV.

So total mass energy is 5588.964 +15.9775=5604.9415 MeV=5.6049415 GeV.

So E=gamma × m0 c²=3.57142857 ×5.6049415 GeV.

Let me compute this accurately.

3.57142857 ×5.6049415.

Let me compute 3 ×5.6049415=16.8148245.

0.57142857 ×5.6049415.

Compute 0.5 ×5.6049415=2.80247075.

0.07142857 ×5.6049415= let's compute 5.6049415 ×0.07142857.

0.07142857 is 1/14, so 5.6049415 ÷14= approx 0.400353.

So adding 2.80247075 +0.400353=3.20282375.

So total E=16.8148245 +3.20282375=20.01764825 GeV.

So E≈20.0176 GeV.

But none of the options are exactly this. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, perhaps using the kinetic energy instead of the total energy.

Wait, the question says, 'the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)'. RHIC accelerates ions to a certain energy. I think in particle physics, the energy typically referred to is the kinetic energy (K), not the total energy (E). So maybe I should compute the kinetic energy instead of the total energy.

Wait, let me think. The total energy E is gamma mc², and the kinetic energy K is (gamma -1) mc².

So, if the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, then K= (gamma -1) * m0 c².

In that case, let's compute K.

Gamma is 3.57142857, so gamma -1 =2.57142857.

So K=2.57142857 ×5.6049415 GeV.

Compute that.

2.57142857 ×5.6049415.

2×5.6049415=11.209883.

0.57142857 ×5.6049415=3.2028237 (as before).

So K=11.209883 +3.2028237=14.4127067 GeV.

But none of the options are near 14.4 GeV. So probably, the question is asking for the total energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the rest mass as 6 ×938 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

So, E=gamma ×5.628.

3.57142857 ×5.628.

Let me compute this.

3.57142857 ×5.628 = ?

3 ×5.628=16.884.

0.57142857 ×5.628=3.217.

So total E=20.101 GeV.

Which is close to option C (20.132 GeV) but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is more precise.

Wait, let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.628.

3.57142857 ×5.628 = ?

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.628.

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.028=0.100000000 (since 3.57142857 ×0.028 =0.10000000).

So 0.6 part is 2.142857142, 0.028 part is 0.1.

So 2.142857142 +0.1=2.242857142.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.242857142=20.100000 GeV.

So E=20.1 GeV. So option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 0.032 GeV higher.

Hmm, perhaps the question expects us to use more precise values for gamma or the mass.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute 1 - v²/c².

v=0.96c.

v²/c²=0.96^2=0.9216.

So 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So the exact value of gamma is 25/7.

Now, the mass of Li-6 is 6.017152534 u.

So 6.017152534 ×931.494 MeV/u=5.6049415 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 ×5.6049415=20.0176 GeV.

But none of the options match exactly. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Is the nucleus moving at 0.96c, and the energy given is the kinetic energy, not the total energy?

Wait, in high-energy physics, often when they refer to the energy of a collider, they mean the kinetic energy per particle. Let me check.

Wait, in the RHIC, the energy per ion is typically given as the kinetic energy, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.

Wait, if the question is about the total energy, it's E=gamma m c². If about kinetic energy, then K=(gamma-1)m c².

In our earlier calculation, using the sum of the masses (5.628 GeV), the total energy is 20.1 GeV, and the kinetic energy is about 14.47 GeV. But the options don't include that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total energy using the exact mass and exact gamma and see which option it aligns with.

E=gamma * m0 c²=3.57142857 ×5.6049415=20.0176 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 20.132, which is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, 20.0176 is closer to option C than any other option. Wait, but 20.0176 is about 20.018 GeV, which is 20.018, and the option C is 20.132. That's a difference of 0.114 GeV, which is 114 MeV. That's a significant difference. But perhaps the problem uses the sum of the individual nucleon masses.

Wait, if using the sum approach, the E was 20.101 GeV, which is still about 0.03 GeV below option C.

So perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recheck the gamma calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact expression for gamma.

Gamma =1/sqrt(1 -v²/c²).

v=0.96c.

v²=0.9216 c².

So gamma=1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the speed.

Wait, no, the speed is given as 0.96c.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, based on the sum of individual masses.

But according to the exact calculation, using the atomic mass, it's about 20.0176 GeV, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the sum of the individual masses, leading to 20.1 GeV, which is option C (20.132 GeV) when rounded to four decimal places.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it using the exact numbers.

Wait, let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.628.

3.57142857 ×5.628.

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.628.

Breaking it down:

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.628.

3.57142857 ×0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.028=0.100000000.

So 2.142857142 +0.1=2.242857142.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.242857142=20.100000 GeV.

So if the question uses the sum of individual nucleon masses, E=20.1 GeV. But option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to be done without considering the binding energy, leading to E=20.1 GeV, which is closest to option C.

But looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. My calculation using sum gives 20.100 GeV. Perhaps the slight difference is due to more precise intermediate steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 20.132 GeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the nucleus X (Li-6) is moving at a speed of \( v = 0.96c \), we calculate the total energy \( E \) using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m_0 \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
\]
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]
\[
\sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28
\]
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} = 3.57142857
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy \( m_0 c^2 \)
The nucleus X is Li-6, which has a mass of \( 6.017152534 \, \text{u} \). Using \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), the rest mass energy is:

\[
m_0 c^2 = 6.017152534 \times 931.494 \, \text{MeV} = 5604.9415 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6049415 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
Using \( E = \gamma m_0 c^2 \):

\[
E = 3.57142857 \times 5.6049415 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this into components:

\[
3 \times 5.6049415 = 16.8148245 \, \text{GeV}
\]
\[
0.57142857 \times 5.6049415 = 3.20282375 \, \text{GeV}
\]
\[
E = 16.8148245 + 3.20282375 = 20.01764825 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.0176 \, \text{GeV} \). However, none of the options match this value exactly. The closest option is **C) 20.132 GeV**, which likely accounts for slight differences in approximations or assumptions about the rest mass.

### Conclusion
Based on the calculations and the provided options, the best match is:

**Answer: C**
