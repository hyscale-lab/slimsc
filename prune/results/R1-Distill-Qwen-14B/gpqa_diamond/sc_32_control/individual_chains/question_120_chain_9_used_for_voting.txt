Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula for distance in parsecs is distance = 1 / plx, where plx is in arcseconds.

Wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. So, that probably means the number density of stars is uniform in space. Like, same number per cubic parsec everywhere. I think uniform distribution here implies that the actual number of stars doesn't drop off with distance, but it's spread out the same everywhere.

But how does parallax come into play? Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So as distance increases, parallax decreases. So if I consider a small change in parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, I should figure out how many stars fall into that range.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So it's the number of stars that have parallaxes in a small range dplx. Let's think about that.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a volume element depends on the volume. But in terms of parallax, how does the volume change with parallax? Let's model this.

The distance d is 1/plx. So, if parallax changes by dplx, what's the change in distance, dd? Let's see: plx = 1/d, so dplx = - (1/d^2) dd. Hmm, that might come in handy. Let me think about it in terms of differentials.

So, dplx = - (1/d²) dd → dd = -d² dplx. But since d is a positive quantity and dplx is a small positive change, perhaps I should take absolute values. So, the change in distance is proportional to d squared times the change in parallax. Wait, but we're interested in the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx, which would correspond to d and d + dd, but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe I should express the volume in terms of distance and find how volume changes with parallax.

In 3D space, the volume between distance d and d + dd is (4π/3)( (d+dd)^3 - d^3 ). But for small dd, this can be approximated as 4π d² dd. So the volume element is proportional to d squared times dd. But since we're looking at a change in parallax, perhaps we can express this in terms of dplx.

Since d = 1/plx, dd = -d² dplx. So, the volume element becomes 4π (d^2) * (-d^2 dplx) ). Wait, that would be 4π (d^2) * (d^2 dplx) ) but with the negative sign indicating direction—maybe I can ignore the sign for the magnitude.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The volume element between d and d + dd is 4π d² dd. So, substituting dd from above: dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx. Because plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So, dd = - (d²) dplx.

So, the volume element is 4π (d^2) * ( -d² dplx ). The negative sign just indicates direction, so for the magnitude, it's 4π d^4 dplx. But wait, d is 1/plx, so d = 1/plx → d^4 = (1/plx)^4. So the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

But wait, the number of stars in that volume depends on the number density, which is uniform. Let's say the number density is n stars per cubic parsec. So, the number of stars in the volume element would be n * volume element. So, number of stars = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, it's (number of stars) / dplx. That would be n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx / dplx = n * 4π (1/plx^4).

Wait, but 4π is a constant factor. So the number of stars per unit parallax range is proportional to 1/plx^4. So, the number goes as 1 over plx to the fourth power.

Looking at the options, option A says ~ 1/plx^4, which matches. Option D is ~1/plx^3, which is not what we got.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check.

Another approach: if the number density of stars is uniform, then the number of stars in a spherical shell of radius d and thickness dd is proportional to the surface area (4πd²) times the thickness (dd) times the number density. So N = n * 4π d² dd. But since we're looking at how this relates to parallax, which is plx = 1/d.

Expressing d in terms of plx: d = 1/plx. So, dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

So, substituting into N: N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/plx^2 dplx )

The negative sign just tells us about the direction, but since we're considering the magnitude, it's N = n *4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars per unit parallax range (dplx) is N/dplx = n *4π (1/plx^4).

So again, the result is proportional to 1/plx^4, which is option A.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes when you have a transformation of variables, you have to consider more than just the substitution. Let me think in terms of differentials.

The number of stars in a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx is the same as the number of stars in a shell from d to d + dd, where d = 1/plx and dd is the change in d.

The volume of that shell is 4π d² dd. So, the number of stars is n * 4π d² dd.

Express in terms of plx: d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

Substitute into N: N = n *4π (1/(plx)^2) * ( -1/(plx)^2 dplx )

Again, magnitude is proportional to 1/plx^4 * dplx. So, per unit dplx, it's 1/plx^4. So the answer is A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density of stars is constant in space. The number of stars in a spherical shell of radius \( d \) and thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \).

Expressing \( d \) in terms of parallax, \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), and substituting \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \), the volume element becomes:

\[
dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}.
\]

Substituting this into the expression for the number of stars in the shell, we get:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 \cdot |dd| = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}.
\]

Simplifying, the number of stars in the shell is proportional to:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide by \( d\text{plx} \), resulting in:

\[
\frac{N}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \), which corresponds to option A.
