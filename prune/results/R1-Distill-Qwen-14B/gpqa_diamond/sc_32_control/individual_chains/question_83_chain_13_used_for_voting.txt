Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration and pH calculations. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I'll need to calculate both pH values and see which option matches.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. So first, I should calculate the concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and after adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So, M2 would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me do that math: (0.05 * 20) /40 = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, the titration with NaOH. The reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base). The balanced equation should be CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. 

Now, for the equivalence point. At equivalence, moles of NaOH added equal moles of CH3COOH. Let's see; first, find the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. Volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L) and concentration is 0.025 M. Moles = Molarity * Volume = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. So, to reach equivalence, we need 0.001 moles of NaOH.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So, the volume needed would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. But wait, the question is about the equivalence point pH, so I don't need the exact volume for that part. 

At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted into acetate ions (CH3COO^-), which is the conjugate base. So the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate. Sodium acetate dissociates completely in water: CH3COO^- + Na+ → Na+ + CH3COO^-. The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water to produce OH^- ions, making the solution basic.

To find the pH at equivalence, I'll need the Kb of acetate. Since I know the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5, I can find Kb using Kw = Ka * Kb. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, wait. Let me compute that again. 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is equal to (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9. 1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405, so Kb is about 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate ions in solution at equivalence: The total volume is the initial diluted volume (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added (which we calculated as 10 cm³, right? Because 0.001 moles at 0.1 M is 10 cm³). So total volume is 50 cm³ (0.05 L). The moles of acetate are 0.001 moles, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

So, acetate ion concentration is 0.02 M. Now, setting up Kb expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-] produced:

Kb = x^2 / (0.02 - x) ≈ x^2 / 0.02, since Kb is very small.

So x^2 = Kb * 0.02 → x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) → around 3.288e-6 M. 

[OH^-] is approximately 3.288e-6 M. Then pOH is -log(3.288e-6). Let's calculate that. Log(3.288) is about 0.516, so pOH = 5.484. So pH = 14 - 5.484 ≈ 8.516. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 8.52. But let me double-check because sometimes we might have made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me verify the Kb calculation again. Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5, so Kb is (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (10^-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1e-9)/(1.85) → 5.405e-10. That's correct.

And the concentration of acetate is 0.001 moles in 0.05 L → 0.02 M. So the approximation holds because x is much smaller than 0.02. So the OH- is about 3.288e-6 M, pOH is ~5.48, so pH is 8.52. So the equivalence point pH is around 8.52.

Now, the other part is the pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. Let's find how much NaOH is added.

Total moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. 25% of that is 0.00025 mol. Moles of NaOH added is also 0.00025 mol (since it's 1:1). So let's figure out the concentrations.

The solution at 25% titration: some of the acetic acid is converted to acetate. Let's use a ICE table.

Initial concentrations:
[CH3COOH] = (0.001 - 0.00025) / (0.04 + V_NaOH). Wait, what's the total volume here? The initial solution was 40 cm³, and we added V_NaOH. Wait, how much NaOH have we added?

Moles of NaOH added is 0.00025 mol. The concentration is 0.1 M. So volume = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L → 2.5 cm³. So total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So in the solution:

Moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed: 0.00025 mol.

So concentrations:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = let's calculate that. 0.00075 / 0.0425 → approximately 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 → about 0.005882 M.

So now, the solution is a buffer solution of acetic acid and acetate. So we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5 → pKa ≈ 4.73 (since log(1.85)=0.267, so 5 - 0.267=4.733, but I'll use 4.73 for simplicity).

Plugging in the concentrations:

pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)

Let me compute that ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253.

Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52. So the pH at 25% is around 4.26, and equivalence is 8.52. So option A would be the one.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me double-check the calculation for the concentrations. Because when you add NaOH, you're adding a strong base, which will neutralize some of the acetic acid. The resulting solution after 25% titration would have excess acetic acid and some acetate. 

Alternatively, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is correct here because it's a buffer solution. The ratio of [A^-]/[HA] is (moles of acetate)/(moles of acetic acid). Since moles of acetate is 0.00025 and acetic acid is 0.00075, the ratio is 1/3, so log(1/3) is indeed about -0.477.

So the pH is 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.25. Which is near option A's 4.26. So that's the first pH value.

So the two pH values are approximately 4.26 and 8.52. Looking at the options:

Option A says 4.26; 8.52. That matches.

Wait, let me look at the options again:

Option D: 4.57; 6.92

Option B: 3.17; 6.73

Option C: 4.73;7.

Hmm, so option A is the one that matches our calculations.

Wait, but why isn't the equivalence point pH higher in some cases? Wait, no, because sodium acetate is a weak base, so the pH at equivalence is around 8.5, which is what we got.

So I think the correct answer is option A.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³, and it is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the new concentration is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \times 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we calculate the pH at the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized by NaOH, forming acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻), which hydrolyze in water to produce OH⁻ ions. The moles of acetic acid initially are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH₃COOH} = 0.025 \times 0.04 = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

At equivalence, the total volume is the sum of the diluted acetic acid volume (40.00 cm³) and the NaOH volume (10.00 cm³, calculated from \( V = \frac{\text{moles}}{\text{concentration}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} \)), giving a total volume of 50.00 cm³. The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The \( K_b \) of acetate is calculated using \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \). Using the expression for \( K_b \):

\[
K_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}]} \implies [OH^-]^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
[OH^-] = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[OH^-] = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48,
\]

and the pH at equivalence is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

Next, we calculate the pH at 25% titration. At this point, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 2.50 \, \text{cm³} = 42.50 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH₃COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]

and the moles of acetate formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH₃COO⁻} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH₃COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}]}{[\text{CH₃COOH}]}\right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73 \). Substituting the concentrations:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log\left(\frac{0.00588}{0.01765}\right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at equivalence is 8.52. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) 4.26; 8.52.**
