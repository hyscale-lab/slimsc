Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, right? So it's P = P_x + P_y σ_y + P_z σ_z? Hmm, no, wait. Actually, the components are matrices. Oh right, each component P_x, P_y, P_z is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

The problem gives me each component:

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]].
P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]].
P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]].

So the operator P is a vector operator, and the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n would have components (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), because in the x-z plane, the angle φ would be 0 or π, but since it's arbitrary, maybe φ is 0? Or perhaps any direction in x-z plane, so the angle φ is arbitrary but we can choose a coordinate system where n is along some angle, say, θ from the z-axis.

Wait, but the eigenvector is along the direction n. Oh wait, no, wait. The operator is for the component of spin along n. So the operator P here is actually the spin operator along an arbitrary direction n. But wait, the operator given in the problem is for each component, so the spin operator S is given by S = (S_x, S_y, S_z), and the component along n would be S·n = S_x n_x + S_y n_y + S_z n_z. Oh wait, but perhaps the operator P is the spin operator along n, so P = n·σ (times ħ/2), since σ is the Pauli matrices.

Wait, but the question says "the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane." So P is the operator for the component of spin along n. So P would be (ħ/2) times (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). Since n is in the x-z plane, n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). So n_x and n_z can be expressed in terms of an angle θ. Let's say n is at an angle θ from the z-axis, so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Because in spherical coordinates, the components are (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since it's in the x-z plane, φ=0 or φ=π, but perhaps we can just take φ=0 for simplicity.

So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, and n_y = 0. So the operator P would be (ħ/2) [ sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ].

Wait, but σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So substituting, P becomes:

(ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that matrix:

First, sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] is [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]].

Then cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] is [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]].

Adding these two matrices together:

Top-left: cosθ
Top-right: sinθ
Bottom-left: sinθ
Bottom-right: -cosθ.

So P matrix is (ħ/2) * [[ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ].

We need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so the equation is (P - (ħ/2)I ) |v> = 0.

Let me write out the matrix (P - (ħ/2) I ):

Each element is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix elements I wrote before, subtracted by (ħ/2) times identity matrix.

Wait:

P is (ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ].

So P minus (ħ/2) I is:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ - 1, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ - 1 ] ].

Wait, because I is the identity matrix with 1s on the diagonal. So when we subtract (ħ/2) I, each diagonal element of P is (ħ/2)*element, and then subtract (ħ/2)*1. So for the top-left element:

P has (ħ/2)*cosθ. Subtract (ħ/2)*1. So that element becomes (ħ/2)(cosθ -1).

Similarly, the top-right and bottom-left are (ħ/2) sinθ, and bottom-right is (ħ/2)(-cosθ -1).

But since we're dealing with the eigenvalue equation, the matrix equation is:

[ (ħ/2)(cosθ -1)   (ħ/2) sinθ ] [a]   = 0
[ (ħ/2) sinθ        (ħ/2)(-cosθ -1) ] [b]

Since the determinant of (P - λ I) must be zero for non-trivial solutions, but perhaps it's easier to set up the equations and find a ratio between a and b.

Let me write the equations:

( (ħ/2)(cosθ -1) ) a + ( (ħ/2) sinθ ) b = 0
( (ħ/2) sinθ ) a + ( (ħ/2)(-cosθ -1) ) b = 0

We can factor out ħ/2 from each equation:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
sinθ a + (- cosθ -1 ) b = 0

So from the first equation: (cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] * b.

Hmm, perhaps we can write a in terms of b.

Alternatively, let's look for non-trivial solutions (a, b not both zero). So the ratio a/b = [ - sinθ ] / [ cosθ -1 ].

Wait, but [ cosθ -1 ] can be rewritten using the trig identity: 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), so cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(θ/2).

Similarly, sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So substituting:

a/b = [ - 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] / [ -2 sin²(θ/2) ) ]

The negatives cancel, and 2 cancels:

a/b = [ sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] / [ sin²(θ/2) ) ] = cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) = cot(θ/2).

So a = b cot(θ/2).

Wait, that's interesting. So the ratio a/b is cot(θ/2). So the eigenvector can be written as (a, b) = (cot(θ/2), 1 ), but scaled appropriately.

Wait, but let's check this. Let's take b = 1, then a = cot(θ/2). So the eigenvector is [ cot(θ/2), 1 ].

But we need to normalize this vector. So the normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, eigenvectors are generally taken as unit vectors, so we need to find a and b such that |a|² + |b|² =1.

Given a = cot(θ/2), and b=1, let's compute |a|² + |b|².

But wait, cot(θ/2) could be complex? No, because θ is a real angle here. So a is real, b is real, so the normalization is (cot²(θ/2) ) + 1 = csc²(θ/2), because 1 + cot² x = csc² x.

So the normalization factor is 1 / sqrt( csc²(θ/2) ) ) = |sin(θ/2)|.

So the normalized eigenvector would be [ cot(θ/2) sin(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, let's compute that:

cot(θ/2) = cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2).

So the first component is [ cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2) ] * sin(θ/2) = cos(θ/2).

The second component is sin(θ/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, so the components are [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

But wait, let me double-check. Let me substitute:

a = cot(θ/2) = cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2).
b = 1.

After normalization, the vector is (a * sin(θ/2), b * sin(θ/2)) ), because sin(θ/2) is the normalization factor.

So a * sin(θ/2) = [ cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2) ] * sin(θ/2) = cos(θ/2).

b * sin(θ/2) = 1 * sin(θ/2) = sin(θ/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, especially with spin-1/2 particles, the spin-up state along an arbitrary direction is often written as [ cos(θ/2), e^{i φ} sin(θ/2) ], because the general spherical coordinates have φ as the azimuthal angle. But in this problem, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so φ=0 or π, perhaps.

But wait, in the problem statement, the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, which is the x-z plane, so φ is either 0 or π, but in our case, perhaps the angle is such that the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which matches this. But wait, option B is (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ). But that doesn't match. So perhaps option C is the correct one.

Wait, but let's think again. The eigenvector we found is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but why? Because when we wrote the ratio a/b = cot(θ/2), that led to a = cos(θ/2), b = sin(θ/2) after normalization.

But let me think about the eigenvalue equation: (P - (ħ/2) I ) |v> = 0.

So substituting the matrix we found earlier:

The matrix (P - (ħ/2) I ) is:

(ħ/2) [ cosθ -1, sinθ ] in the first row.
[ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] in the second row.

So the equations are:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
sinθ a + ( - cosθ -1 ) b = 0

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the equations.

From the first equation:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0 → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ - 1) ] b.

But cosθ - 1 = - (1 - cosθ ) = -2 sin²(theta/2).

And sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So substituting:

a = [ - (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) ] / [ -2 sin²(theta/2) ) ] * b.

The negatives cancel, and 2 cancels, so:

a = [ sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / ( sin²(theta/2) ) ] * b.

Which simplifies to:

a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] * b → a = cot(theta/2) * b.

So if we let b = 1, then a = cot(theta/2).

The vector is [a, 1] = [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

But to normalize, the magnitude squared is a² + b² = cot²(theta/2) + 1 = [ cos^2(theta/2) / sin^2(theta/2) ) ] + 1 = [ cos^2 + sin^2 ] / sin^2 = 1/sin^2(theta/2) → so the normalization factor is sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), 1 * sin(theta/2) ].

Which simplifies to [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

Looking at the options again:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

Hmm, but in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi is 0. So the eigenvector would have e^{i phi} as 1, but since option C doesn't have that factor, perhaps that's correct.

Wait, but wait a second. The eigenvector I found is for the eigenvalue +ħ/2, which is the spin-up state along n. But I'm not considering any phase factors here. Do I need to consider that?

But in the problem, we're asked for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So the answer would be (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

Alternatively, let's think about another approach. The spin matrices are:

S_x = ħ/2 [[0,1],[1,0]]
S_y = ħ/2 [[0,-i],[i,0]]
S_z = ħ/2 [[1,0],[0,-1]]

The operator we're dealing with is S·n, where n is in the x-z plane.

So n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), perhaps. So S·n would be S_x sinθ + S_z cosθ.

So S·n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ].

As before, which is the same as the matrix we had earlier.

The eigenstates of S·n are the eigenstates with eigenvalues ±ħ/2.

So for the eigenvalue +ħ/2, the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), and for -ħ/2, it's ( -sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ), perhaps? Wait, let me think again.

Wait, for the spin-up state along z, the eigenvector is (1, 0), which corresponds to theta=0. Plugging into our expression, cos(0/2)=1, sin(0/2)=0. So that works.

For theta=pi/2, n is along x. So the eigenvector should be (0,1) for spin-up along x. Wait, no, wait: no, for S_x, the eigenstates are |+x> = (|0> + |1> ) / sqrt(2), and |−x> = (|0> - |1> ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, but according to our expression for theta=pi/2, cos(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2, and sin(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2. So the vector is (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2), which is |+x> as expected.

Yes, that seems correct.

So the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which matches option C.

To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the operator \( \vec{P} \) for a muon along an arbitrary direction \( \vec{n} \) lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue \( +\hbar/2 \). The operator \( \vec{P} \) is constructed from its components:

- \( P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \),
- \( P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix} \),
- \( P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \).

Since \( \vec{n} \) lies in the x-z plane, it can be parametrized as \( \vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta) \). The operator \( \vec{P} \) along \( \vec{n} \) is given by:

\[
\vec{P} = \vec{n} \cdot \vec{\sigma} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \sigma_x + \cos\theta \sigma_z \right),
\]

where \( \sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \) and \( \sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \). Substituting these, the matrix representation of \( \vec{P} \) becomes:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \( +\hbar/2 \), we solve the eigenvalue equation:

\[
\left( \vec{P} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I \right) |v\rangle = 0,
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix. Subtracting \( \frac{\hbar}{2} I \) from \( \vec{P} \), the matrix becomes:

\[
\vec{P} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvector \( |v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} \) satisfies the system of equations:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0,
\]
\[
\sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0.
\]

From the first equation, we find:

\[
a = \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta - 1} b.
\]

Using the trigonometric identities \( \cos\theta - 1 = -2\sin^2(\theta/2) \) and \( \sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2) \), the ratio simplifies to:

\[
a = \cot(\theta/2) b.
\]

Choosing \( b = 1 \), the eigenvector becomes \( |v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). To normalize it, we compute:

\[
|a|^2 + |b|^2 = \cot^2(\theta/2) + 1 = \csc^2(\theta/2).
\]

The normalization factor is \( \sin(\theta/2) \), so the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches option C. The other options are incorrect because:

- Option A does not involve trigonometric functions of \( \theta/2 \).
- Option B introduces an extra phase factor \( e^{i\phi} \), which is not relevant here since \( \vec{n} \) lies in the x-z plane.
- Option D introduces unnecessary factors of \( \hbar \), which are not part of the eigenvector.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
