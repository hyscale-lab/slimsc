Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So, I guess I'm dealing with special relativity here because the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light.

I remember that when dealing with relative speeds in relativity, you can't just subtract the velocities like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is something like (v1 - v2) divided by (1 - (v1 v2)/(c squared)). Wait, but wait—if both are moving in the same direction, then the relative speed would be the difference between their speeds divided by 1 minus their product over c squared.

Wait, no, actually, let me get that straight. The formula is u = (u1 - u2)/(1 - (u1 u2)/(c²)). Since both are moving in the positive x-direction, I think u1 is 0.6c and u2 is 0.5c, so the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

Wait, but the denominator becomes 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. The numerator is 0.1c. So the relative speed is (0.1c)/(0.7) = (1/7)c, which is approximately 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c, which is about 0.14 times the speed of light. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's a start.

Now, the other part is the total energy of the system. Since these are relativistic speeds, I should be using the total energy formula for each astronaut, which is gamma multiplied by m c squared. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 is Gamma1 * m_rest * c². Wait, wait, the astronaut's mass is 2m, so E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Similarly, for the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75). Let me compute that. Sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660. So 1/0.866 is about 1.1547.

So E2 = Gamma2 * 3m c² = 1.1547 *3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Now the total energy E_total is E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 m c² + 3.464 m c² = 5.964 m c². Rounding that, it's approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc², which is way off. So the correct option should be C.

Wait a second, let me double-check the velocity calculation. u = (0.6c -0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/c²) = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. Yep, that's correct.

So the relative speed is approximately 0.14 c, and the total energy is approximately 5.96 m c². So the correct option is C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
