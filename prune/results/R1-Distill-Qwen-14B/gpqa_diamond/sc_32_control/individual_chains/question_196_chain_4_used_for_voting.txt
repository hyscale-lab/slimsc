Okay, so I've got this question about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my physics, but let me think through this. Alright, the question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic context.

So, the setup: it's a 1-dimensional system, mass m, maximum amplitude A. The force is F = -kx, obeying Hooke's law. But since it's relativistic, I guess we have to consider how the speed approaches the speed of light, c.

Wait, in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a spring is (1/2)kA², so the kinetic energy is also (1/2)kA². Then, KE = (1/2)mv²_max². So solving for v_max, we get v = sqrt(kA²/m). But that's the non-relativistic case.

But this is a relativistic scenario, so I can't use that formula directly. Relativistic mechanics uses energy considerations where total energy includes rest mass energy. So the total energy E is gamma mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. But wait, in the case of a harmonic oscillator, the total energy comes from the potential energy at maximum displacement, right?

So at maximum amplitude A, all the energy is potential. In classical terms, it's (1/2)kA², but relativistically, does that change? Hmm, maybe not, because in the relativistic context, the potential energy might still be treated the same, but the kinetic energy is different because of the gamma factor.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The potential energy in the spring is given by U = (1/2)kx², which is the same as the classical case, I think. So when x is at maximum A, U = (1/2)kA². At that point, the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is (1/2)kA².

But when the mass is moving, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. Instead, it's the relativistic formula: KE = (gamma - 1)mc².

So the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. At maximum speed, the potential energy is zero (because kinetic is maximum), so E = (gamma) mc². But wait, no, wait. Because when the mass is at x=0, it's moving the fastest, right? So at x=0, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. So the total energy E is (gamma) mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but earlier, I thought E is (1/2)kA². So setting E = (gamma) mc² = (1/2)kA². So solving for gamma would give me the relation between v and the parameters.

Wait, no, actually, when the mass is at maximum displacement A, its speed is zero, so all energy is potential. Then, when it's at the equilibrium position (x=0), the speed is maximum, and all energy is kinetic. So the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So total energy E is (gamma) mc², which equals the potential energy (1/2)kA².

So setting them equal: (gamma) mc² = (1/2)k A².

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me think again. Oh wait, actually, in the non-relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and that's equal to the kinetic energy at maximum speed, which is (1/2)mv_max². So the maximum speed is sqrt(kA²/m). But relativistically, the total energy when the mass is at A is (1/2)kA², which should equal the total energy when it's at x=0, which is (gamma) mc².

So: (1/2)kA² = gamma mc².

So gamma = (k A^2)/(2 m c²) * ... Wait, no. Wait, (1/2)kA² = gamma mc². So solving for gamma: gamma = (k A^2)/(2 m c²) * (1/(1/2))?

Wait, wait, let's do the math correctly. (1/2)kA² = gamma mc². So gamma = (k A²)/(2 m c²) * 1/(1/2) ? Wait, no, that's not correct. Let's rearrange it:

gamma = (1/2 k A²) / (m c²) ) * 2 ?

Wait, no. Let me write it as:

gamma = ( (1/2) k A² ) / ( m c² )

So gamma = (k A²) / (2 m c² )

Wait, but gamma is also equal to 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Hmm. Let me square both sides to get rid of the square root:

1/(1 - v²/c²) ) = (k² A^4) / (4 m² c^4 )

So, 1 - v²/c² = (4 m² c^4 ) / (k² A^4 )

Wait, no. Wait, that would be taking reciprocal on both sides.

Wait, let's take reciprocal:

(1 - v²/c²) = (2 m c²)^2 )/(k² A^4 )

Wait, wait, perhaps a different approach. Let's denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) as some variable to simplify. Let me call that term x: x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2). Then, gamma = x.

So, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = x.

So, 1 - v²/c^2 = 1/(x^2)

So, v²/c^2 = 1 - 1/(x^2).

But v_max² = c² (1 - 1/x² )

Wait, x is (k A^2) / (2 m c² ), so 1/x is (2 m c²)/(k A^2 )

So, v_max² = c² [ 1 - (2 m c²)/(k A^2 ) ] ?

Wait, that can't be right because if (k A^2)/(2 m c²) is large, then 1/x² is small, and v approaches c, which makes sense.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me go through it again.

From gamma = (1/2 k A^2)/(m c^2 )

Wait, (1/2 k A^2) is the potential energy, which is equal to the total energy E. So E = gamma m c².

So gamma = E/(m c²) = (1/2 k A²) / (m c² )

So, gamma = k A²/(2 m c² )

Hmm, okay. Then, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = k A²/(2 m c² )

Let me call this term for simplicity: Let’s say (k A²)/(2 m c² ) = G. So gamma = G.

So, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ) = G → sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/G → 1 - v²/c² = 1/G² → v²/c² = 1 - (1/G² )

So, v_max² = c² (1 - 1/G² )

But G is (k A²)/(2 m c² ), so G² is [k² A^4 ] / [4 m² c^4 ]

So, 1/G² = 4 m² c^4/(k² A^4 )

Thus, v_max² = c² [ 1 - (4 m² c^4)/(k² A^4 ) ) ]

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Let me factor it differently.

v_max² = c² [ (k² A^4 - 4 m² c^4 ) / (k² A^4 ) ) ]

Hmm, but this seems a bit messy. Maybe I should express it another way.

Wait, another approach. Let me solve for v in terms of gamma.

From gamma = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So, square both sides: 1/(1 - v²/c²) = (k² A^4 )/(4 m² c^4 )

Multiply both sides by denominator:

1 = [ (k² A^4 )/(4 m² c^4 ) ] (1 - v²/c² )

So,

1 = (k² A^4 / (4 m² c^4 )) ) - (k² A^4 v^2 )/(4 m² c^6 )

Hmm, this seems getting complicated. Maybe it's better to express v_max in terms of gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps we can rearrange the equation:

gamma = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

gamma = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 )

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = (k A²) / (2 m c^2 )

Let me take reciprocal on both sides:

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 2 m c² / (k A² )

Then square both sides:

1 - v^2/c^2 = (4 m² c^4 ) / (k² A^4 )

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - (4 m² c^4 ) / (k² A^4 )

Multiply both sides by c^2:

v^2 = c^2 [1 - (4 m² c^4 )/(k² A^4 ) ]

Wait, but that looks like v^2 = c² (1 - [something]). So for v_max to be real, the term in the brackets must be positive. So 1 must be larger than (4 m² c^4 )/(k² A^4 )

Which implies that (k A^2 )/(2 m c² ) must be greater than 1, otherwise 1/(gamma ) would be larger than 1, which isn't possible. Because gamma must be >= 1. So if (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) <1, then the equation would give v^2 negative, which is impossible. So perhaps in reality, the maximum amplitude A is such that (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) >=1. Otherwise, the system wouldn't oscillate in a real sense.

But perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's get back to the main equation.

So,

v_max² = c² [ 1 - (4 m² c^4 )/(k² A^4 ) ]

Hmm, but that doesn't look like any of the options given. Let me look at the options again.

Option C is v_max = sqrt( k A^2/m ), which is the classical result. But that can't be the correct answer here because it's the relativistic case.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m ))^2 )

Wait, that looks complicated. Let me calculate 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m ))². Wait, that denominator would be (1 - k A^2/(2 m )) squared. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps expressing v_max in terms of gamma.

We have v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma² )

Because from gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ), so sqrt(1 - v²/c² )=1/gamma → 1 - v²/c² = 1/gamma² → v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma² → v = c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma² )

So substituting gamma = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

v = c sqrt( 1 - [ 2 m c²/(k A² ) ]² )

Wait, that gives v_max = c sqrt( 1 - ( (2 m c^2 )/(k A² ) )^2 )

Hmm, which can be rewritten as:

v_max = c sqrt( [ (k A² )^2 - (2 m c^2 )^2 ] / (k A² )^2 )

Which simplifies to:

c * sqrt( (k² A^4 - 4 m^2 c^4 ) ) / (k A² )

Which is:

c * sqrt( k² A^4 -4 m² c^4 ) / (k A^2 )

Hmm, but none of the options exactly match this. Let me look again at the options.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, that can't be right because the units don't match. Wait, no, the denominator inside the square root is 1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ), which is a dimensionless quantity, so the 1/(...) is also dimensionless. So this would be sqrt(1 + something), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the expression for gamma as:

gamma = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So, 1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(gamma^2 )

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/gamma^2 = (gamma^2 - 1)/gamma^2

So,

v = c * sqrt( (gamma^2 -1 ) ) / gamma

Which can be written as c * sqrt( 1 - (1/gamma^2) )

Wait, but that's what I had before.

Alternatively, perhaps using the expression for gamma in terms of v.

Wait, perhaps let me try expressing v in terms of the given options.

Looking at option A:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m ))^2 )

But that would require that (k A²)/(2m) is a term. Wait, but in our expression, gamma is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), so perhaps that's different.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an expression that can match the form I have.

We have:

v² = c² [ 1 - (4 m² c^4 )/(k² A^4 ) ]

Wait, perhaps factor this differently. Let me write it as:

v^2/c^2 = 1 - (4 m^2 c^4) / (k^2 A^4 )

Hmm, let me make the denominator k^2 A^4 = (k A^2 )².

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ (k^2 A^4 ) - 4 m^2 c^4 ] / (k^2 A^4 )

Which is,

v^2/c^2 = [ (k A^2 )^2 - (2 m c^2 )^2 ]/(k A^2 )^2 = [ (k A^2 - 2 m c^2 )(k A^2 +2 m c^2) ]/(k A^2 )^2

Not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write v_max in terms of gamma.

We have gamma = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So, v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2 )

Which would be v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - (2 m c^2 )^2 / (k A^2 )^2 )

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps another approach: non-relativistic limit.

If the amplitude is small, then (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) is <<1, so gamma is approximately 1. Then v_max ≈ c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1)^2 ) =0. Which can't be right.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, that can't be right because in the non-relativistic case, v_max should approach sqrt(kA^2/m ), so perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the non-relativistic case. So when v is much less than c, we can approximate gamma as 1 + (1/2)(v^2/c^2 ), but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the energy approach. The total energy E is (1/2)k A², which in relativity is the sum of the rest energy and kinetic energy. So,

E = gamma m c^2 = (1/2)k A^2.

So, gamma = (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

So, gamma = (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

But gamma is also 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ), so,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = (k A² )/(2 m c^2 )

Hmm. Let's let's denote (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) as G for simplicity.

So,

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1/G

So,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/G²

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/G^2

Which gives,

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/G^2 )

But G is (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ), so G² is (k² A^4 )/(4 m^2 c^4 )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - (4 m^2 c^4 )/(k² A^4 ) )

Hmm, this is the same expression I had earlier.

Looking at the options, none of them seem to match this exactly. Let me check the options again.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2m ))^2 )

Hmm, that might be a possibility. Let me compute the term inside.

If I have 1/(1 - x)^2 , where x is (k A²)/(2m )

So,

1 + [1/(1 - x)^2 ] = [ (1 - x)^2 + 1 ] / (1 -x )^2

Wait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can manipulate the expression for v_max.

Wait, perhaps I can write 1 - (4 m² c^4 )/(k² A^4 ) as (k² A^4 - 4 m^2 c^4 )/(k^2 A^4 )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (k^2 A^4 -4 m^2 c^4 ) / (k^2 A^4 ) )

Which is,

v_max = c * sqrt( (k^2 A^4 -4 m^2 c^4 ) ) / (k A^2 )

Hmm, but I don't see any option that looks like this.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Let me re-examine the options.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, but that would be:

sqrt(1 + [1/(1 - x)] ), where x = (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

Let me compute that expression.

1 + 1/(1 -x ) = ( (1 -x ) +1 ) / (1 -x ) ) = ( 2 -x )/(1 -x )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2 -x )/(1 -x ) )

Hmm, not sure.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Hmm, let me compute that.

Inside the square root: 1 - [1/(1 + y)^2 ] where y = (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1 - [1/(1 + y )^2 ] = [ (1 + y )^2 -1 ] / (1 + y )^2 ) 

The numerator: (1 + 2y + y^2 ) -1 = 2y + y^2 = y(2 + y )

So,

= [ y (2 + y ) ] / (1 + y )^2 

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ y (2 + y ) ] / (1 + y )^2 )

= c * sqrt( y (2 + y ) ) / (1 + y )

Hmm, but I don't know if this leads me to the expression I have.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Maybe the total energy is not just the potential energy. Wait, in a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy might have a different form.

Wait, no, because the force is F = -k x, which is the same as the classical case, so the potential energy U is (1/2)k x². So the approach should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy includes both kinetic and potential, but at maximum displacement, the kinetic is zero, so E = U = (1/2)k A².

Wait, but in relativity, the total energy is gamma m c². So,

gamma m c² = (1/2)k A^2.

So, gamma = (k A² )/(2 m c² )

So, same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can rearrange the expression for v_max in terms of gamma. So,

v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2 )

Gamma is (k A² )/(2 m c² )

So,

1/gamma = (2 m c^2 )/(k A^2 )

So,

1/gamma^2 = (4 m² c^4 )/(k² A^4 )

So,

v_max = c sqrt(1 - (4 m^2 c^4 )/(k² A^4 ) )

Hmm.

Looking back at the options, perhaps none of them match exactly, but maybe I can factor it differently.

Wait, let's factor numerator and denominator.

v_max = c * sqrt( [k^2 A^4 - 4 m^2 c^4 ] ) / (k A² )

= c * sqrt( (k A² )^2 - (2 m c^2 )^2 ) / (k A^2 )

Hmm, that looks similar to sqrt(a^2 - b^2)/(a), which is sqrt(1 - (b/a)^2 )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - ( (2 m c^2 )/(k A^2 ) )^2 )

Which is the same as,

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - ( 2 m c^2 / (k A^2 ) )^2 )

Hmm.

Looking at the options again, perhaps option A is a possibility if I can relate it.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m ))^2 )

Wait, but in our expression, the term inside the sqrt is 1 - [something squared], while option A has 1 + something.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think about the energy.

Wait, perhaps in relativistic terms, the potential energy is not (1/2)kx². Maybe I need a relativistic expression for the potential energy. But I think that in this problem, it's given that F = -kx, so the potential energy is the same as classical, because F is the negative gradient of the potential. So U = integral of F dx = (1/2)k x². So, that part should be correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the total energy includes both the rest energy and the kinetic energy, but when the mass is at maximum displacement, the kinetic energy is zero, so E = rest energy + potential energy.

Wait, wait, that would be E = m c^2 + (1/2)k A^2.

But that doesn't make sense because when the oscillator is at rest (not moving), the potential energy is (1/2)k A^2 and the rest energy is m c². But when it's moving, the total energy would be higher than m c² because of the kinetic energy.

But in the problem, the maximum speed is when the kinetic energy is maximum, which occurs when the potential energy is zero. So,

E = kinetic energy + rest energy.

At maximum displacement, E = rest energy + potential energy.

So,

E = m c² + (1/2)k A².

At maximum speed, E = gamma m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor for the maximum speed.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the total energy E is the same whether the mass is at maximum displacement or maximum speed. So,

At maximum displacement, E = m c² + (1/2)k A^2.

At maximum speed (x=0), E = gamma m c².

So setting them equal,

gamma m c² = m c² + (1/2)k A^2.

Then,

gamma = 1 + (1/2 k A^2 )/(m c² )

Hmm, that's different from what I had earlier. That changes everything. So I think I made a mistake earlier by not including the rest energy in the potential.

Wait, that makes a lot more sense. Because the rest energy (m c² ) is a separate component. So, in that case, the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy when the mass is at maximum amplitude.

So,

E = m c² + (1/2)k A^2.

And when the mass is at x=0, the total energy is gamma m c^2.

So,

gamma m c^2 = m c^2 + (1/2)k A^2.

So,

gamma = 1 + ( (1/2)k A^2 )/(m c^2 )

= 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Hmm, okay. So that expression for gamma is different from before. Now, gamma would be greater than 1.

So, gamma = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Hmm, then,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Let me let x = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1 + x.

So,

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1/(1+x )

Square both sides:

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1 +x )^2

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + x )^2

= [ (1 + x )^2 -1 ] / (1 +x )^2

= (1 + 2x + x^2 -1 ) / (1 + x )^2

= (2x + x^2 ) / (1 + x )^2

So,

v^2 = c^2 (2x + x^2 ) / (1 + x )^2

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this.

= c^2 x (2 + x ) / (1 + x )^2 

But x = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v^2 = c^2 ( (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) ( 2 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) ) / ( 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 

Simplify numerator and denominator.

Let me factor (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) as x.

So,

v^2 = c^2 x (2 + x ) / (1 +x )^2 

But x is (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) * ( 2 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )) ] / [ (1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ]

Hmm, perhaps I can simplify this expression.

Let me factor the denominator:

(1 + x )^2 = 1 + 2x + x^2.

In the numerator:

x (2 +x ) = 2x + x^2 = x (x +2 )

Not sure if this helps.

Wait, maybe express the numerator and denominator in terms of x.

So, numerator: x (2 +x )

Denominator: (1 +x )^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ x (2 +x ) ] / (1 +x )^2 )

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write v in terms of x.

v = c * sqrt[ x (2 + x ) ] / (1 +x )

But that might not directly match any of the options.

Let me look at the options again.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m ))^2 )

Hmm, perhaps this is a clue.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the expression for v^2.

v^2 = c^2 [ x (2 +x ) ] / (1 +x )^2.

But x = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) ( 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Hmm, this looks complicated, but let me try to manipulate it.

Let me denote y = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v^2 = c^2 * y (2 + y ) / (1 + y )^2

But 2 + y = 2 (1 + y/2 )

Hmm, not sure. Maybe expand the numerator.

v^2 = c² y (2 + y ) / (1 + y )²

= c² y ( (2 + y) ) / (1 + y )^2

Hmm, perhaps factor the numerator and denominator.

Hmm, perhaps if I factor 2 + y = (1 + y ) +1.

Wait,

2 + y = (1 + y ) +1.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * y [ (1 + y ) +1 ] / (1 + y )^2

= c^2 * [ y (1 + y ) + y ] / (1 + y )^2

= c^2 [ y (1 + y ) + y ] / (1 + y )^2

= c^2 [ y (1 + y + 1 ) ] / (1 + y )^2

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think differently.

Alternatively,

v^2 = c^2 [ y (2 + y ) ] / (1 + y )^2

Hmm.

Let me compute this for small y. Let's say y is very small, so we can approximate.

So,

v^2 ≈ c^2 [ y * 2 ] / (1 )^2 = 2 c^2 y.

But y = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), so,

v^2 ≈ 2 c^2 * (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) = (k A^2 )/( m )

Which gives v_max ≈ sqrt( k A²/m ), as expected in the non-relativistic limit.

So, the expression seems to make sense.

But I'm not seeing how this connects to the options. Let me re-examine the options.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m ))^2 )

Hmm, let's compute the term inside.

Compute (1 - (k A^2)/(2m )):

= [ (2m - k A^2 ) ]/( 2m )

So,

1/(1 - (k A^2 )/(2m ))^2 = [ (2m )/(2m -k A^2 ) ]^2

So, 1 + [ (2m )^2 ]/(2m -k A^2 )^2 )

= [ (2m -k A^2 )^2 + (2m )^2 ] / (2m -k A^2 )^2

= [4 m^2 -4 m k A^2 +k^2 A^4 +4 m^2 ] / (2m -k A^2 )^2

= [8 m^2 -4 m k A^2 +k^2 A^4 ] / (2m -k A^2 )^2

Hmm, not sure. Maybe this is not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression is option B.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Hmm, let me compute the inside.

Let me compute 1/(1 - x ), where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1 + 1/(1 -x ) = (1 -x +1 ) / (1 -x ) )= (2 -x )/(1 -x )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2 -x )/(1 -x ) )

Hmm, where x is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

(2 -x ) = 2 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

(1 - x ) = 1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Hmm, perhaps this can be connected to the expression I have for v^2.

Wait, from earlier, v^2 = c^2 [ x (2 +x ) ]/(1 +x )^2

Which is,

v^2 = c^2 * x (2 +x ) / (1 +x )^2

But x = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

x (2 +x ) = [ (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ] * [ 2 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]

= [ (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ] * [ (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) ]

= [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps express the options in terms of gamma.

Wait, we have gamma = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

gamma = 1 + x

So,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/gamma^2 )

= c sqrt( (gamma^2 -1 ) / gamma^2 )

= c sqrt( ( (1 + x )^2 -1 ) / (1 + x )^2 )

= c sqrt( (1 + 2x +x^2 -1 ) / (1 +x )^2 )

= c sqrt( (2x +x^2 )/(1 +x )^2 )

Which is,

c * sqrt( x (2 +x ) ) / (1 +x )

Which is the same as before.

But looking at the options, perhaps I can manipulate this to match option A or B.

Wait, let's think, perhaps I can write the expression under the square root as:

(v/c )^2 = (2x +x^2 )/(1 +x )^2 

= [x (2 +x ) ]/(1 +x )^2 

= [ x (2 +x ) ] / (1 +x )^2 

Hmm, not matching any option.

Wait, maybe I can write this as:

(v/c )^2 = [x (2 + x ) ] / (1 + x )^2 

= [ x ( (1 + x ) + 1 ) ] / (1 +x )^2 

= [ x (1 + x ) + x ] / (1 + x )^2 

= [ x (1+x ) ]/(1+x )^2 + x/(1+x )^2 

= x/(1+x ) + x/(1+x )^2 

Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor something else.

Wait, perhaps this could be rewritten as:

(v/c )^2 = [ x (2 + x ) ] / (1 + x )^2 

= [ x ( (1 + x ) +1 ) ] / (1 + x )^2 

= x/(1 +x ) + x/(1+x )^2 

Hmm, but I'm not seeing a clear match.

Wait, looking at option B again:

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

So,

(v/c )^2 = 1 + 1/(1 - x ), where x = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

= [ (1 -x ) +1 ] / (1 -x )

= (2 -x )/(1 -x )

So,

(v/c )^2 = (2 -x )/(1 -x ) 

Which is,

(2 - x )/(1 -x ) 

= [ (1 -x ) +1 ] / (1 -x )

= 1 + 1/(1 -x )

Hmm, but this is the same as option B's expression. So,

v = c * sqrt( (2 - x )/(1 - x ) )

But from our earlier derivations, (v/c )^2 is different. So unless our earlier approach is wrong, option B can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps my initial setup was incorrect. Let me re-express.

In the initial approach, I considered the total energy E = m c^2 + (1/2)k A^2, and E also equals gamma m c^2.

But perhaps I should have considered that when the mass is at maximum amplitude, all the energy is potential, so E = (1/2)k A^2, and when it's at maximum speed, E = gamma m c^2.

But that can't be correct because when the mass is at rest, the energy would be just m c^2, but when it's moving, the energy is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the oscillator's energy without the rest mass energy. But that would be non-relativistic treatment.

Hmm, perhaps that's the case. Maybe the problem assumes that the rest mass energy is negligible, which would bring us back to the initial approach.

Wait, that would be the case if the problem is considering the energy in the oscillator as purely potential and kinetic, without the rest energy. But that's not consistent with relativity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is formulated in a way that the kinetic energy is (gamma -1 ) m c^2, but that would complicate things.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can express v_max in terms of gamma.

From gamma = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

gamma -1 = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

gamma -1 = x 

We have,

v = c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2 )

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express it as,

v = c sqrt( (gamma^2 -1 ) ) / gamma 

= c sqrt( x (2 +x ) ) / (1 +x )

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can express this as,

v = c * sqrt( x (2 +x ) ) / (1 +x )

Which is,

v = c * sqrt( [x (2 +x ) ] ) / (1 +x )

Hmm.

Looking at the options, perhaps none of them match, but perhaps I can manipulate the given options to see if any can be transformed into this.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

So,

Inside the square root, it's 1 + 1/(1 - y ), where y = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

= [ (1 -y ) +1 ] / (1 - y )

= (2 - y )/(1 - y )

So, this becomes sqrt( (2 -y )/(1 -y ) )

Hmm.

Wait, in our expression, (v/c )^2 = x (2 +x )/(1+x )^2, where x = y = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

(v/c )^2 = y (2 +y ) / (1 +y )^2 

Which can be written as:

= (y (2 + y )) / ( (1 + y )^2 )

= [ y * (2 + y ) ] / ( (1 + y )^2 )

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps if I can manipulate this expression to match something in the options.

Wait, suppose I write,

y = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

y (2 + y ) = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) * [ 2 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]

= [ k A^2 (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 )^2 

Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can express the numerator and denominator in terms of 1 + y.

So,

y (2 +y ) = y (1 + y +1 )

= y (1 + y ) + y 

So,

[ y (2 +y ) ] / (1 + y )^2 = [ y (1 + y ) + y ] / (1 + y )^2 

= y/(1 + y ) + y/(1 + y )^2 

Hmm, but I don't see how that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the given options have terms like 1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), which is (1 - y ), and perhaps I can relate that to our expression.

But I'm not seeing a direct connection.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the expression for v_max in terms of the options.

Let me compute option B's expression.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - y ) )

Where y = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v_max = c sqrt( (2 - y )/(1 - y ) )

So,

(v_max/c )^2 = (2 - y )/(1 - y )

But our expression is,

(v/c )^2 = y (2 + y )/(1 + y )^2 

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can write y (2 + y ) = y ( (1 + y ) +1 )

= y (1 + y ) + y 

So,

= y (1 + y ) + y 

So,

y (2 + y ) = y (1 + y ) + y 

Thus,

(v/c )^2 = [ y (1 + y ) + y ] / (1 + y )^2 

= y (1 + y )/(1 + y )^2 + y / (1 + y )^2 

= y/(1 + y ) + y/(1 + y )^2 

Hmm, not helpful.

At this point, none of the options seem to match the expression I have for v^2/c^2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me go back.

In the relativistic scenario, the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. At maximum displacement, the mass is momentarily at rest, so all the energy is potential. So,

E = (1/2)k A^2 + m c^2 

At maximum speed, the mass is at x=0, so all the energy is kinetic and rest energy.

So,

E = gamma m c^2 

Thus,

gamma m c^2 = m c^2 + (1/2)k A^2 

So,

gamma = 1 + (1/2)k A^2/( m c^2 )

Hmm, that's the same as earlier.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1 / [ 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]

So,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 / [ 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2 

Thus,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1 / [ 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2 

= [ (1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ))^2 

The numerator is,

(1 + 2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) + (k A^2 )^2/( (2 m c^2 )^2 )) -1 

= 2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) + (k A^2 )^2/( (2 m c^2 )^2 )

= (k A^2 )/( m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4 )/(4 m^2 c^4 )

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ (k A^2 )/( m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4 )/(4 m^2 c^4 ) ] / (1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps factor out (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) from the numerator.

So,

(k A^2 )/( m c^2 ) = 2 (k A^2 )/( 2 m c^2 )

Similarly,

(k^2 A^4 )/(4 m^2 c^4 ) = [ (k A^2 )/( 2 m c^2 ) ]^2 

So,

Numerator: 2 x + x^2, where x = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Denominator: (1 +x )^2 

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ 2x +x^2 ]/(1 +x )^2 

Which is,

= x (2 +x )/(1 +x )^2

Wait, same as before.

Hmm.

So, I think none of the options match this, but perhaps I can manipulate it to look like option D.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

So,

(v/c )^2 = 1 - 1/(1 +x )^2, where x= (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

= [ (1 +x )^2 -1 ]/(1 +x )^2 

= [ 1 + 2x +x^2 -1 ]/(1 +x )^2 

= (2x +x^2 )/(1 +x )^2 

Which is same as our expression.

So,

(v/c )^2 = (2x +x^2 )/(1 +x )^2 

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2x +x^2 )/(1 +x )^2 )

= c * sqrt( x (2 +x ) )/(1 +x )

Which is the same as option D's expression.

Wait, let me compute option D again.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

So,

Inside the sqrt: 1 - 1/(1 +x )^2 = [ (1 +x )^2 -1 ]/(1 +x )^2 = (2x +x^2 )/(1 +x )^2 

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2x +x^2 )/(1 +x )^2 )

Which is same as our derived expression.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( x (2 +x ) )/(1 +x )

So, option D matches.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which we've determined is correct.

So the correct answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and force \( F = -kx \), we start by considering the conservation of energy. The total energy \( E \) of the system is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement. At maximum amplitude \( A \), the potential energy is \( U = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and the total energy is:

\[
E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

At maximum speed, when the mass is at \( x = 0 \), all the energy is kinetic, and the total energy is given by the relativistic expression:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( E \), we have:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

Dividing through by \( mc^2 \), we obtain:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Let \( x = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + x
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + x)^2
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + x)^2}
\]

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + x)^2}
\]

Substituting \( x = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we find:

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
\]

This matches the expression given in **Option D**. The other options do not align with the derived result. For example:

- **Option A** incorrectly includes a term \( \frac{1}{1 - \frac{kA^2}{2m}} \), which does not match the derived expression.
- **Option B** incorrectly adds terms in a way that does not correspond to the relativistic energy conservation.
- **Option C** is the non-relativistic result and does not account for the Lorentz factor.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
