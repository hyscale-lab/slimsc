Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, it's about finding the uncertainty in P_z given a state that's an eigenstate of P_x. I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through this step by step.

First, the setup: the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The question is about the uncertainty ΔP_z. I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the expectation value of the square minus the square of the expectation value. So ΔP_z = sqrt(<P_z²> - <P_z>²).

Wait, right. So I need to compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ and ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩. Then, subtract the square of the first from the second, take the square root, and that's the uncertainty.

But wait, the basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the given state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z? Or is it in another basis? Let me check the problem statement again. Oh, right, it says the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state is given in the P_z eigenbasis.

Wait, but the state is an eigenstate of P_x, not of P_z. So the state is a superposition of the P_z eigenstates. So when we compute <P_z>, it's the expectation value in that state, which might not be an eigenstate of P_z, leading to some uncertainty.

Wait, but if the basis is the P_z eigenbasis, then the state is expressed in terms of |m> where P_z |m> = mħ |m> (assuming the eigenvalues are mħ, perhaps m=+1, 0, -1). Let me check the matrix for P_z.

P_z matrix is [[ħ, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0,0,-ħ]]. So the eigenvalues are +ħ, 0, -ħ. So the basis states are |+> = [1, 0, 0], |0> = [0,1,0], and |-> = [0,0,1]. The given state is a vector ψ = [-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2]^T.

So to compute <P_z>, I can take the inner product of ψ with P_z ψ, or since in the P_z basis, each component corresponds to the eigenvalue. Let me think: since the state is a combination of |+>, |0>, |->, the expectation value <P_z> would be the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Wait, in the P_z basis, the state ψ can be written as a linear combination of |+>, |0>, |->. The components of ψ in this basis are the coefficients. So the square of each component gives the probability of measuring that eigenvalue. So ψ's components are:

a_+ = -1/2 → |a_+|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 → contribution to <P_z> is (1/4)*ħ (since P_z eigenvalue for |+> is +ħ).

a_0 = 1/√2 → |a_0|² = 1/2 → contribution is (1/2)*0 = 0.

a_- = -1/2 → |a_-|² = 1/4 → contribution is (1/4)*(-ħ).

Wait, so <P_z> is (1/4)*ħ + 0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0. So the expectation value of P_z is zero.

Hmm, but wait, this is the expectation value. But since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, which doesn't commute with P_z, the uncertainties would be non-zero.

Now I need to compute <P_z²>. Since P_z is diagonal in its eigenbasis, P_z squared is just the square of each eigenvalue on the diagonal. So for each component |m>, P_z² |m> = (mħ)^2 |m>.

So <P_z²> is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by (mħ)^2.

So let's compute each part:

For |+> (m=+1), |a_+|² * (ħ)^2 = (1/4) * ħ².

For |0> (m=0), |a_0|² * (0)^2 = 0.

For |-> (m=-1), |a_-|² * (ħ)^2 = (1/4) * ħ².

So <P_z²> = (1/4 + 0 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

Now, <P_z> is 0, so <P_z>² is 0. Therefore, ΔP_z = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt( (ħ²)/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, that's one of the options. Looking at the choices, option B is ħ/√2.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is the given state correctly written in the P_z basis? The state is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Let me check normalization. The sum of the squares is (-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1/4 + 1/4) + 1/2 = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So it's normalized, that's correct.

So the calculation seems correct. The uncertainty is ħ/sqrt(2), which is option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The given state is expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, where the basis states are $|+\rangle = [1, 0, 0]^T$, $|0\rangle = [0, 1, 0]^T$, and $|-\rangle = [0, 0, 1]^T$. The state is:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $+\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ for the states $|+\rangle$, $|0\rangle$, and $|-\rangle$, respectively. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_{m} |a_m|^2 \cdot m\hbar,
\]

where $|a_m|^2$ are the probabilities (squared magnitudes of the components of $\psi$). The components of $\psi$ are:

\[
a_+ = -\frac{1}{2}, \quad a_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad a_- = -\frac{1}{2}.
\]

The probabilities are:

\[
|a_+|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |a_0|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |a_-|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ squares the eigenvalues of $P_z$, so its eigenvalues are $(+\hbar)^2 = \hbar^2$, $0^2 = 0$, and $(-\hbar)^2 = \hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_{m} |a_m|^2 \cdot (m\hbar)^2.
\]

Using the probabilities and eigenvalues:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, we have:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \hbar = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
