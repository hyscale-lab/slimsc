Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let's read it carefully.

The question is: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino. The rest mass of Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, but I think in these problems, they're often considered massless unless stated otherwise. So I'll assume the neutrino here has negligible mass.

The problem is asking for the kinetic energies of the product particles. So the products are muon and neutrino. But wait, neutrino's mass is almost zero, so it's just the muon that has significant mass here.

Let me think about conservation laws. Since Pi is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum after decay must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu. But since the neutrino's mass is negligible, its energy would be approximately equal to its momentum (in units where c=1, E = p for massless particles).

But wait, how do I approach this? Maybe I should use conservation of energy and momentum.

The initial energy is just the rest mass of Pi, which is 139.6 MeV.

After decay, energy is the sum of the energies of mu and nu. The energy of each particle is the total energy, which includes their rest mass and kinetic energy. But neutrino's rest mass is zero, so its energy is just its kinetic energy plus any rest mass energy (which is zero). Wait, no: the neutrino's total energy is sqrt(p²c^4 + m²c^4). But if m is negligible, E ≈ pc. So the neutrino's energy is kinetic energy plus rest mass energy (which is zero). So E_nu = K_nu + 0, so E_nu = K_nu.

But the muon has both rest mass and kinetic energy. So E_mu = K_mu + m_mu c². Wait, no. The rest mass energy is m_mu c², which is 105.7 MeV. So E_mu = K_mu + 105.7 MeV.

So the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = (K_mu + 105.7) + K_nu.

This must equal the initial energy, which is 139.6 MeV. So:

K_mu + 105.7 + K_nu = 139.6

So K_mu + K_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.

Now, for conservation of momentum. The momentum vectors must cancel. Let's denote the magnitude of momentum of mu as p, and that of nu as p. Because they must be equal and opposite.

So for the muon, total energy squared is (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2. So,

E_mu² = (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2

Similarly, for the neutrino, E_nu² = (p c)^2 (since m_nu is ~0)

But wait, E_mu is K_mu + 105.7, and E_nu is K_nu.

So, (K_mu + 105.7)^2 = (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2

And, (K_nu)^2 = (p c)^2

So substituting the second equation into the first:

(K_mu + 105.7)^2 = (K_nu)^2 + (105.7)^2

Expanding the left side:

K_mu² + 2 * K_mu * 105.7 + 105.7² = K_nu² + 105.7²

Subtract 105.7² from both sides:

K_mu² + 2 * 105.7 * K_mu = K_nu²

But from earlier, we know that K_mu + K_nu = 33.9. Let me write K_nu = 33.9 - K_mu.

So substitute K_nu into the equation:

K_mu² + 2*105.7*K_mu = (33.9 - K_mu)^2

Expand the right side:

= 33.9² - 2*33.9*K_mu + K_mu²

So,

K_mu² + 211.4*K_mu = 1149.21 - 67.8*K_mu + K_mu²

Subtract K_mu² from both sides:

211.4*K_mu = 1149.21 -67.8*K_mu

Bring all terms to one side:

211.4*K_mu +67.8*K_mu - 1149.21 =0

279.2 * K_mu = 1149.21

K_mu = 1149.21 / 279.2

Let me compute that. Hmm, 279.2 times 4 is 1116.8, which is about 1149.21 - 1116.8 = 32.41 left. So 4 + (32.41/279.2) ≈ 4 + 0.116 → 4.116 MeV.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Wait 279.2 *4 = 1116.8. 1149.21 -1116.8 = 32.41.

32.41 / 279.2 ≈ 0.116.

So K_mu ≈ 4.116 MeV.

Then K_nu = 33.9 - 4.116 ≈ 29.784 MeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches closely.

Wait, but wait a second. Because in the beginning, the neutrino's energy is considered as K_nu, but in reality, the neutrino's energy is its kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy. But since its rest mass is considered zero, E_nu = K_nu.

But wait, another approach: since the pion is at rest, the decay products must have equal and opposite momenta. Let me think about the invariant mass.

Wait, perhaps using the energy and momentum conservation equations. Let me denote the muon as m and the neutrino as n.

Conservation of energy: E_pion = E_m + E_n.

E_pion = m_pion c² = 139.6 MeV.

E_m = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 )

E_n = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_n c²)^2 ) ≈ p c (since m_n ≈ 0)

So,

139.6 = sqrt( p² c^4 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c

Let me let x = p c.

So,

139.6 = sqrt( x² + (105.7)^2 ) + x

Let me subtract x from both sides:

139.6 - x = sqrt(x² + 105.7²)

Square both sides:

(139.6 - x)^2 = x² + 105.7²

Expand the left side:

139.6² - 2*139.6 x + x² = x² + 105.7²

Subtract x² from both sides:

139.6² - 279.2 x = 105.7²

Compute 139.6^2: 139.6 *139.6. Let's approximate: 140²=19600, 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 - 0.4)^2=140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4²=19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

Similarly, 105.7^2: Let me compute 105^2=11025, 0.7^2=0.49, and 2*105*0.7=147. So 105.7^2=11025 + 147 +0.49=11172.49.

So,

19488.16 - 279.2 x = 11172.49

Subtract 11172.49 from both sides:

8315.67 = 279.2 x

So x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that.

279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So 29.86?

Wait, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30=8376 minus 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8. Hmm, but 8315.67 is between 29 and 30 times.

Compute 8315.67 / 279.2 = let's see, 279.2*29=8096.8, subtract that from 8315.67:

8315.67 -8096.8=218.87.

218.87 /279.2 ≈ 0.783.

So x ≈ 29.783 MeV/c.

So x = p c ≈29.783 MeV/c.

Wait, but earlier in the initial approach, I had K_mu=4.116 and K_nu=29.784. Which matches.

So the kinetic energy of the muon is K_mu=4.116 MeV, and the neutrino's kinetic energy is about 29.78 MeV.

Which corresponds to option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

Wait a moment, but wait. The neutrino's energy is x =29.783 MeV. But that's E_nu. Since E_nu = K_nu, because m_nu is negligible, then K_nu is 29.783 MeV. Wait, but from the earlier equation, K_mu + K_nu =33.9 MeV. So 4.116 +29.783≈33.9, which matches.

So the KE of mu is ~4.12 MeV, and KE of nu is ~29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 and 29.8, which matches.

To determine the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \ ( \text{at rest} ) \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

we use conservation of energy and momentum. The rest mass of the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is \(139.6 \, \text{MeV}\), and the rest mass of the muon (\(\mu^+\)) is \(105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). The neutrino (\(\nu\)) is assumed to have negligible mass.

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino:
\[
E_{\text{final}} = E_{\mu^+} + E_{\nu}.
\]

The energy of the muon is:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = K_{\mu^+} + m_{\mu^+} c^2 = K_{\mu^+} + 105.7 \, \text{MeV},
\]
where \(K_{\mu^+}\) is the kinetic energy of the muon. The energy of the neutrino is approximately equal to its kinetic energy since its rest mass is negligible:
\[
E_{\nu} \approx K_{\nu}.
\]

Equating the total energy before and after the decay:
\[
139.6 = K_{\mu^+} + 105.7 + K_{\nu}.
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
K_{\mu^+} + K_{\nu} = 33.9 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Conservation of Momentum
Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum after the decay must be zero. The momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:
\[
p_{\mu^+} = p_{\nu}.
\]

The total energy of the muon is related to its momentum by:
\[
E_{\mu^+}^2 = (p_{\mu^+} c)^2 + (m_{\mu^+} c^2)^2.
\]

Substituting \(E_{\mu^+} = K_{\mu^+} + 105.7\) and \(p_{\mu^+} c = p_{\nu}\), we get:
\[
(K_{\mu^+} + 105.7)^2 = (K_{\nu})^2 + (105.7)^2.
\]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[
K_{\mu^+}^2 + 2 \cdot 105.7 \cdot K_{\mu^+} = K_{\nu}^2.
\]

Using \(K_{\nu} = 33.9 - K_{\mu^+}\), substitute into the equation:
\[
K_{\mu^+}^2 + 211.4 \cdot K_{\mu^+} = (33.9 - K_{\mu^+})^2.
\]

Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
K_{\mu^+}^2 + 211.4 \cdot K_{\mu^+} = 1149.21 - 67.8 \cdot K_{\mu^+} + K_{\mu^+}^2.
\]

Canceling \(K_{\mu^+}^2\) from both sides:
\[
211.4 \cdot K_{\mu^+} = 1149.21 - 67.8 \cdot K_{\mu^+}.
\]

Combining terms:
\[
279.2 \cdot K_{\mu^+} = 1149.21.
\]

Solving for \(K_{\mu^+}\):
\[
K_{\mu^+} = \frac{1149.21}{279.2} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Substituting \(K_{\mu^+} = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) into \(K_{\mu^+} + K_{\nu} = 33.9\):
\[
K_{\nu} = 33.9 - 4.12 = 29.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energy of the muon is \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\), and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\). This matches option D.
