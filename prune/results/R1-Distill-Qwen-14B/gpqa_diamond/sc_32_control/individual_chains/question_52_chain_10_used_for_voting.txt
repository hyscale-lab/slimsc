Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about stars with spots and the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when a star has spots, it affects its overall temperature. The problem says that without spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but wait—does the spot temperature affect this ratio? I think the spots are cooler regions, right? But the question says the photosphere's effective temperature decreases, so the star is emitting less total radiation because part of its surface is at a lower temperature.

The main point here is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is given by the Boltzmann equation, which relates the populations of two energy levels. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) and E is the energy difference between levels. Since the problem mentions the wavelength of 1448 Å, which is in the near UV, I can find the energy difference from that.

Wait, let me compute the energy difference ΔE. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. Wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1.448e-7 meters. So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) ≈ let's calculate that.

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divided by 1.448e-7 m gives 1.373e-18 J per photon. Hmm, but we need this in terms of k*T. Oh, right, because the exponent in Boltzmann is ΔE/(kT). So let's compute the energy in eV to make it easier, since k is in eV per K.

Wait, 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So E in eV is (1.373e-18 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 8.57 eV. That's a big chunk. So delta E is about 8.57 eV.

But wait, what's the transition for Ti? I think Ti I (neutral titanium) has a line around 1448 Å. The exact energy might not be needed if we're just looking at the ratio and the change due to temperature.

The ratio n2/n1 depends on temperature. The higher the temperature, the more the higher energy level is populated. So when the star's temperature is higher (without spots), the ratio n2/n1 should be higher. But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K vs 6000 K). So without spots, Teff is higher, so the ratio is higher. But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So the ratio is lower when the star has spots. So the ratio without spots is higher than with spots. So the factor is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots.

Wait, but the question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. So it's (n2/n1)_no_spots divided by (n2/n1)_spots.

So the ratio depends exponentially on 1/T. Let me think about the Boltzmann factor. The ratio is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). But wait, wait. The Boltzmann equation for the ratio n2/n1 is (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So if ΔE is positive, higher temperature reduces the exponent, making the ratio larger.

Wait no: If energy level 2 is higher than level 1, then E2 = E1 + ΔE. So E2 - E1 = ΔE. So the exponent is negative, because it's -(positive)/(k T). So higher T makes the exponent less negative, so the ratio increases.

So when the star's Teff increases, the ratio n2/n1 increases because the exponential term becomes larger.

In our problem, when the star doesn't have spots, Teff is 6000 K. With spots, Teff is 5500 K. So at 6000 K, the ratio is higher than at 5500 K.

So the factor is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.

But since the ratio is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), the actual ratio between the two would be exp( [ΔE/(k T1)] - [ΔE/(k T2)] ), because when you take the ratio, the g factors might cancel if they are the same for both cases, which I think they are because it's the same element and same levels being considered.

Wait, let me write it properly. The ratio for each case is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So when taking the ratio of the two ratios:

(n2/n1)_T1 / (n2/n1)_T2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, because:

exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let me compute that again. Let me write (n2/n1)_T1 = A exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and (n2/n1)_T2 = A exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ), where A is (g2/g1). So the ratio is [A exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [A exp(-ΔE/(k T2)))] = exp( (-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, that's:

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

So, substituting T1 = 6000 K, T2 = 5500 K.

Wait, but wait, the question is, when the star has spots, the Teff is 5500 K. So T2 is 5500. So T1 is higher, 6000. So 1/T2 is larger than 1/T1. So (1/T2 - 1/T1) is positive. So the exponent is positive. So the factor is e raised to a positive number. So the ratio (n2/n1)_T1 / (n2/n1)_T2 is e^{...}.

Wait, but wait, because when the star has spots, the Teff is lower, so T2 is 5500 K. So when we have spots, T is 5500 K; no spots, 6000 K.

So, the ratio (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Calculating the exponent:

ΔE = hc/λ. Let's compute this. Wait, but earlier I had E = 8.57 eV. Let me make sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute ΔE/(k) in terms of temperature to find the exponent.

Wait, let me compute ΔE/(k) first. Let me compute E = hc/λ.

h=6.626e-34, c=3e8, λ=1448e-10 m.

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

Now, k is Boltzmann's constant: 1.38e-23 J/K.

So E/(k) = 1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 ≈ approximately (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e5 → approx 0.995 * 1e5 ≈ 99,500 K.

So E/(k) ≈ 99,500 K.

So now, the exponent becomes (E/k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000).

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4, 1/6000≈1.667e-4.

Difference is (1.818e-4 - 1.667e-4) = 0.151e-4 = 1.51e-5.

Multiply by E/k: 99,500 K * 1.51e-5 1/K → 99,500 * 1.51e-5 = let's compute that.

99,500 * 1.51e-5 = (99500) * (0.0000151) → 99500 * 1.51e-5 ≈ 1.50245 ≈ approximately 1.5.

So the exponent is about 1.5.

So the factor is e^1.5 ≈ what?

e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is e^1 * e^0.5 ≈ 2.718 * 1.6487 ≈ 4.48.

Wait, more accurately, e^1.5 is approximately 4.4817.

So the ratio (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500 ≈ 4.48.

Looking at the options, option C is 4.5. So the factor is approximately 4.5.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation because sometimes I might have a miscalculation.

Wait, E/k: 1.373e-18 J / 1.38e-23 J/K = (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e5 = approximately 0.995 * 1e5 = 99,500 K. Correct.

Then, 1/5500 -1/6000 = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) ) * 1/(5500 × 6000) ?

Wait, no, wait: 1/5500 = 1/(5.5e3) ≈ 1.818e-4, 1/6000≈1.6667e-4.

Difference: 1.818e-4 - 1.6667e-4 = 0.1513e-4 = 1.513e-5.

Multiply that by E/k (99500 K):

99500 * 1.513e-5 = (99500 * 1.513) * 1e-5.

Compute 99500 * 1.513:

Approximate 100,000 *1.513 = 151,300. Subtract 500 *1.513 = 756.5 → 151,300 -756.5 ≈ 150,543.5.

Multiply by 1e-5: 150543.5e-5 = 15.05435.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it's 1.5. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait, no, I think I messed up the exponents.

Wait, 99500 is 9.95e4. So 9.95e4 * 1.513e-5 = (9.95 *1.513) * 1e-1.

9.95 *1.513 = approx 15.05.

Multiply by 1e-1: 1.505.

Ah, okay, so the exponent is about 1.505.

So e^1.505 is approximately e^1.5 which is about 4.48, as I had earlier.

So the factor is approximately 4.5, which is option C.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_2 \) and \( g_1 \) are the degeneracies of the energy levels, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The ratio of the populations depends exponentially on the temperature.

### Step 1: Energy difference (\( \Delta E \))
The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). Using the relation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we calculate:

\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
E \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, \( \Delta E \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV} \).

### Step 2: Temperature dependence
The ratio of the populations at two temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) is given by:

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Here, \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) (no spots) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \) (with spots). Substituting \( \Delta E \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV} \) and \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \approx \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99,500 \, \text{K}.
\]

The term \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) is:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.818 \times 10^{-4} - 1.667 \times 10^{-4} = 1.51 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) \approx 99,500 \times 1.51 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.5.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the factor
The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\exp(1.5) \approx 4.48.
\]

This corresponds closely to option **C) ~4.5**.

### Final Answer:
The factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels changes is approximately **4.5**.
