Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these synthesis problems. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize the structure. So, it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane ring. And there's also a formyl group (carbaldehyde) attached. So, maybe it's structured like this: the cyclohexane ring has a CH2-OH group connected to another cyclohexane, and a CHO group as well.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond to a carbon, which is connected to another carbon). So, it's cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2- something? Wait, no, ethynyl is C≡C- group. So ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group attached. Or wait, ethynyl is CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So the molecule is cyclohexane with a triple bond to a CH2 group? No, wait, ethynyl is the substituent, so it's cyclohexane-C≡C-H? Hmm, maybe it's more like:

Structure of ethynylcyclohexane: Cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a triple bond to a CH2 group, or perhaps a triple bond with a hydrogen. Wait, perhaps it's cyclohexane attached to a CH2-C≡CH group? No, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. Ethynyl group is -C≡CH. So, ethynylcyclohexane should have a cyclohexane with a substituent that's a triple bond to a CH2 group? Or is it that the cyclohexane is directly attached to the triple bond?

Wait, perhaps it's cyclohexane-C≡CH. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a triple bond attached, where the triple bond is between two carbons. Oh wait, ethynyl is a substituent where the cyclohexane is attached to a carbon that's triple bonded to another carbon. So the structure is cyclohexane-C≡CH. So the starting material is 1-ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with a terminal alkyne group.

Our target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is in turn attached to another cyclohexane. Oh wait, wait. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main ring is cyclohexane. Attached to it is a CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group and a CHO (aldehyde) group. So the main ring has two substituents: a -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl and a -CHO.

Hmm, how can I get from ethynylcyclohexane to that structure? Let me think about the possible reactions and steps.

Looking at the options, the reagents are given in each option. Let me see what each reagent does.

Option A:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd
3. Ba(OH)2
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation, perhaps for alkynyl groups. Methyl chloride would be a methylating agent. So step 1 could be a double deprotonation to form a conjugate base, but I'm not sure.

Option B:
1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/ H2O
4. NH4OH

NaNH2 is again a strong base. Ethyl chloride as the methylating agent, but wait, ethyl chloride is an alkylating agent for substitution. Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base, used for elimination or for deprotonating to form strong bases, perhaps for forming alkyne metalations.

Option C:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate
3. O3/ (CH3)2S
4. Ba(OH)2

H2 and Pd would be hydrogenation. O3 is for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. (CH3)2S is a reductive work-up for ozonolysis, perhaps giving aldehydes or ketones. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination or epoxide ring opening.

Option D:
1. NaNH2, methanol
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/ (CH3)2S
4. NH4OH

Methanol as a methylating agent? Or maybe it's an alkylation.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is an alkyne. So maybe the first step is to functionalize the alkyne.

So, what can we do with an alkyne? One approach is to functionalize it by adding groups, perhaps via hydroamination, but more commonly, maybe we can add a methyl group or other substituents.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, and when combined with an alkyl halide like methyl chloride, perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation. But ethynyl groups are acidic because of the sp-hybridized carbon. So, maybe the first step is deprotonating the ethynyl group to form a -C≡C^- which can then react with an electrophile.

So in step 1, using NaNH2 and methyl chloride, perhaps we're adding a methyl group to the alkyne. But wait, ethynylcyclohexane has a terminal alkyne (C≡CH), so deprotonating with NaNH2 would give a cyclohexyl acetylide. Then, adding methyl chloride would methylate it, but wait, methyl chloride is a primary alkyl halide. Acetylide is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So the acetylide would attack methyl chloride, leading to a di-substituted alkyne: cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. So after deprotonation and alkylation, it becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. So now it's a propargyl group attached to cyclohexane.

Wait, but looking at the target molecule, perhaps we need a substitution where the alkyne is converted into something else. For example, perhaps we can perform a hydrogenation or some addition.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is then attached to the main cyclohexane. Oh wait, perhaps the hydroxymethyl group comes from adding a hydroxyl group to a methyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

Let me think about the possible steps.

First, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a methyl group in some way. Or maybe it's used to form a ring via some cyclization.

Wait, another approach is to think about the target molecule. It's a cyclohexane with two substituents: a hydroxymethylcyclohexyl group and a formyl group.

Wait, so the structure is cyclohexane with a substituent that's a CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group and a CHO group. So, perhaps the main ring is cyclohexane, and the substituents are -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl and -CHO.

So, maybe the synthesis involves adding a methyl group via alkyne alkylation, then hydrogenating the alkyne to a CH2 group, then perhaps adding a hydroxyl group, and then oxidizing to a formyl group.

Wait, but let me think again. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane-C≡CH.

Suppose step 1 is deprotonating the alkyne and methylating it. So, using NaNH2 and methyl chloride would give cyclohexyl-C≡C-Me.

Then, perhaps hydrogenating the alkyne to a single bond. Using H2 and a catalyst like Pd (step 2 in option A is H2/Pd). So, after hydrogenation, the triple bond becomes a single bond, so cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me. Wait, but wait, hydrogenation of an alkyne can give either cis or trans depending on conditions. But if we have H2 and Pd, perhaps it's a catalytic hydrogenation that adds two hydrogens across the triple bond, converting it to a single bond. So, cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me would become cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me? Wait, no, after hydrogenation, the triple bond (C≡C) becomes a single bond, but each carbon gains two hydrogens. So, cyclohexyl-C≡C-Me becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me? Wait, but that would require adding four hydrogens. Oh wait, hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and Pd would first hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond (allylic hydrogenation), but then under high pressure, it can go all the way to single bond. So the product would be cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me?

Wait, but let me think again. The starting material is cyclohexane-C≡CH. After deprotonation and alkylation with methyl chloride, it becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-Me. Then, hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond. So, the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond with two CH2 groups? Or perhaps the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me in a single bond.

Wait, no. When you hydrogenate an alkyne (C≡C) with H2 and a catalyst like Pd, you get the cis alkene first, and then further hydrogenation gives the single bond. So, the product would be a single bond between the two carbons, each with two hydrogens. So, cyclohexane-C(H2)-C(H2)-Me? No, more accurately, the alkyne becomes a single bond, so the structure becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me.

Wait, but if the starting alkyne is cyclohexane-C≡C-H, adding methyl would make cyclohexane-C≡C-Me. Then hydrogenation would make cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me.

Hmm, but how does that help us get to the target? The target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to cyclohexane, so maybe we need to form a ring or some kind of substitution.

Wait, perhaps after adding a methyl group, we then perform a ring-forming reaction. Alternatively, maybe introducing an alcohol group.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into an enol ether or something else.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is attached to the main cyclohexane. So, perhaps the hydroxymethyl group comes from an epoxide opening or some kind of substitution.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into an epoxide after some steps, but that seems less likely.

Wait, let me think about each option's steps. Let's go through each option step by step.

Option A:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: This would deprotonate the ethynyl group to form the acetylide, which would then react with methyl chloride to give cyclohexyl-C≡C-Me.
2. H2/Pd: Hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond, so cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me.
3. Ba(OH)2: Maybe a base-induced elimination. So cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me treated with a strong base like Ba(OH)2 might cause elimination, perhaps forming an alkene or some other structure.
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O: These are conditions for acid-catalyzed hydration, perhaps of an alkene.

Wait, let's see. After step 2, we have cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me. Then step 3 with Ba(OH)2: perhaps elimination to form cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe Ba(OH)2 is for epoxidation, but I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening or something else.

Alternatively, maybe step 3 is a Birch reduction or something else, but not sure. Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right path.

Option B:
1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride: So, similar to before, but with ethyl chloride. The ethynyl group is deprotonated to form the acetylide, which reacts with ethyl chloride to give cyclohexane-C≡C-Et.
2. Li in liquid NH3: Li metal in liquid ammonia is a strong base. It can be used to deprotonate compounds or for elimination. Wait, perhaps for deprotonating to form a stronger base, like in the formation of a Grignard reagent, but that's not likely here. Alternatively, this could be for an elimination reaction, like converting an alkyne into an alkene, but I'm not sure.
3. O3, H2O: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.
4. NH4OH: Work-up after ozonolysis, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps in step 2, we have an alkyne that's being deprotonated and then something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a deprotonation followed by elimination, but I'm not sure.

Option C:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: same as before, leading to cyclohexane-C≡C-Me.
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: Another hydrogenation step. Wait, after step 1, we have the alkyne as C≡C-Me. Hydrogenation would reduce it to CH2-CH2-Me. So the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me.
3. O3/(CH3)2S: Ozonolysis followed by reductive work-up with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, but if after step 2, we have single bonds, then perhaps this step doesn't do much unless there's a double bond. Unless step 2 didn't fully hydrogenate the alkyne, but that's unlikely.
Hmm, maybe this path isn't right.

Option D:
1. NaNH2, methanol: So, perhaps the acetylide is formed (deprotonation of ethynyl group), and then methanol acts as an electrophile. Wait, but methanol is a poor electrophile for alkylation. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. Hmm, not sure. Or perhaps it's a formylation, but I'm not certain.
2. Li in liquid NH3: Again, a strong base. Perhaps for elimination or deprotonation.
3. O3/(CH3)2S: Ozonolysis and reductive work-up.
4. NH4OH: Work-up.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting alkyne is functionalized to introduce a carbonyl group. Let me think about the target molecule. It has a formyl group (CHO) and a hydroxymethyl (CH(OH)-cyclohexyl) group.

Perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a CH2 group, then oxidized to a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe after some alkylation and hydrogenation, we form a diol and then oxidize.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the target structure. It has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is on the main cyclohexane. Also, a formyl group on the main ring.

So, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a CH2 group, then used to form a ring via some kind of cyclization. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is used to form a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, maybe the first step is to add a methyl group to the alkyne, then hydrogenate it to a single bond, then perform some kind of oxidation or ring-forming.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an epoxide, which upon ring-opening would form a diol, but that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps after adding a methyl group, the molecule is hydrogenated to form a CH2 group. Then, a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation to form a ketone, but that's not among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps after alkylation and hydrogenation, an elimination step forms a double bond, which is then ozonolyzed to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, looking at option C's steps: step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyls. So if after step 2 we have a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

But how would we get a double bond? Step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Wait, Pd on CaCO3 is used for hydrogenation, typically. So perhaps after step 1, the alkyne is alkylated and then hydrogenated to a single bond.

Wait, maybe step 3 is where the double bond comes from. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the first step is alkylation to make the alkyne more substituted, then step 2 is partial hydrogenation to a cis double bond, then step 3 is ozonolysis, which would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but the target has a formyl group, which is a CHO. So perhaps one of the ozonolysis products is a CHO group.

So, let's try to outline this path:

1. Starting with ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH).
2. Deprotonate with NaNH2 and alkylate with methyl chloride to get cyclohexane-C≡C-Me.
3. Partially hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis double bond using H2 and Pd (maybe with low H2 pressure). So now we have cyclohexane-C=C-Me (cis).
4. Ozonolysis of the double bond would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. But wait, ozonolysis of a cis double bond would give two carbonyl groups on the same side. But in our case, the structure is cyclohexane-C=C-Me, so ozonolysis would break between C and C-Me, giving two fragments. Wait, but the main ring is cyclohexane, so cleavage would probably break the ring, which I don't think is desired.

Hmm, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternative approach: Maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone. For that, perhaps we can use a hydrohalogenation followed by elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps after alkylation and hydrogenation, we have a cyclohexane with a CH2CH2Me group. Then, treatment with Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, could cause elimination to form a double bond. So step 3 in option A is Ba(OH)2, which would eliminate H2O, leading to a double bond. But wait, where would the hydroxyl group come from? Maybe the molecule has a hydroxyl group already. Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxidation, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe the alkylation and hydrogenation give a diol, which upon treatment with acid would form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting off track. Let me think about each option again.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol: Maybe this is a deprotonation followed by alkylation, but methanol is a poor alkylating agent. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not seeing it. Or maybe it's a way to form an enol ether.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the first step is deprotonating the alkyne to form the acetylide, then reacting with methanol. But methanol is a weak electrophile; perhaps it would methylate the acetylide, giving cyclohexane-C≡C-OCH3. But that's a methyl ester group, which I'm not sure would help.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is forming the acetylide and then performing a substitution with methanol, but that doesn't seem right.

Option B's steps:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride: So, acetylide formed and then alkylated with ethyl chloride to make cyclohexane-C≡C-Et.
2. Li in liquid NH3: Maybe this is for deprotonating the ethyl group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be a Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings. Alternatively, perhaps it's for elimination, forming an alkene from the alkyne. So, using Li in NH3, the alkyne could be converted into an alkene via deprotonation and elimination. So cyclohexane-C≡C-Et would become cyclohexane-C=C-Et.
3. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, cyclohexane ring with a C=C-Et would become two carbonyls. But in this case, the main ring would have a carbonyl group, perhaps leading to a formyl group.
4. NH4OH: Work-up, perhaps aqueous work-up after ozonolysis.

So, after ozonolysis, what would we get? The double bond in the side chain would break, and each end would form a carbonyl. So, cyclohexane-C=C-Et would break into cyclohexane-C=O and Et-O=O? No, wait, ozonolysis of a C=C-Et would give two carbonyl compounds. So the main ring would have a carbonyl group, perhaps as a ketone, and the ethyl part would form an aldehyde or ketone.

But our target has a formyl group (CHO) on the main ring. So perhaps ozonolysis of the ethyl chain would produce a CHO group.

Wait, let's think: the structure after step 2 would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-Et? No, step 2 is converting the alkyne into an alkene. So the structure is cyclohexane-C=C-Et. Ozonolysis would break the C=C into two carbonyl groups. So the main ring would have a carbonyl group attached, and the ethyl part would also have a carbonyl.

Wait, but the main ring is cyclohexane, so if the C=C is between the ring and the ethyl group, ozonolysis would break it into two parts: the ring part would have a carbonyl, and the ethyl would have a carbonyl.

In that case, the product after ozonolysis would be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (CHO on the ring) and ethanal (CH3CHO). Then, in step 4, with NH4OH, perhaps the work-up would protonate the carbonyls, but I'm not sure what exactly would happen here.

But the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps this isn't the right path.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's consider each possible step for each option.

Another angle: The target has both a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to cyclohexane. Maybe one of the steps is an oxidation to form the aldehyde.

Looking at the options, step 3 in option C is O3 with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive work-up that would produce aldehydes and ketones without over-oxidizing. So if there's a double bond, ozonolysis would form carbonyl groups.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group.
2. Partial hydrogenation to form a double bond.
3. Ozonolysis to form a carbonyl group, perhaps the aldehyde.
4. Then, a Ba(OH)2 step for elimination or ring formation.

Wait, but let me outline this:

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane.

Step 1 (option C): NaNH2 and methyl chloride. Deprotonate to form acetylide, then methylate to get cyclohexane-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond, producing cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me.

Wait, but that's a single bond, not a double bond. So how would ozonolysis in step 3 work? It requires a double bond. So perhaps step 2 isn't a full hydrogenation. Maybe it's hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkene.

Wait, maybe step 2 is hydrogenating the alkyne to a cis-alkene. So cyclohexane-C≡C-Me becomes cyclohexane-C=C-Me (cis).

Then, step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, the cyclohexane-C=C-Me would break into two carbonyl compounds.

Wait, but the main ring is cyclohexane, so the cleavage would occur between the two carbons. So one part would be cyclohexane-C=O, and the other would be Me-C=O. But that would form a ketone on the main ring (cyclohexanone) and a methyl ketone (acetone). That doesn't help us get a formyl group.

Hmm, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a step where a substituent is added to the ring to facilitate the formation of the aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is used in a different way.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the target molecule is formed via a cyclopropane ring opening or some kind of cycloaddition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether, which upon hydrolysis forms a carbonyl.

Hmm, getting stuck here. Let me think about the possible steps for each option.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol: Perhaps the acetylide is formed, then treated with methanol. But methanol is a poor electrophile; maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. Alternatively, perhaps it's a formylation, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another possibility: NaNH2 is a strong base that can deprotonate the alkyne, forming the acetylide. Then, methanol could act as an electrophile, perhaps undergoing alkylation to form an ether. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide reacts with methanol to form a ketone. Wait, but that doesn't seem feasible. Maybe it's more likely that the acetylide would react with an alkyl halide, not an alcohol.

So maybe this option isn't the right path.

Option B:

After step 2, with Li in NH3, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an alkene. Then, ozonolysis would form carbonyl groups, leading to a formyl group on the main ring.

But I'm not sure how the hydroxymethyl group would form.

Alternatively, perhaps the target molecule is formed via a conjugate addition or some kind of ring-forming reaction.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the initial steps add a methyl group to the alkyne, then hydrogenate it to a single bond, which is then epoxidized. Then, acid-catalyzed ring-opening forms a diol, which upon oxidation could form a carbonyl.

But the options don't include an epoxidation step, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 in option A is used for elimination to form a double bond, which is then hydrated to form a diol. Then, oxidation could form a carbonyl.

Wait, but the target has both an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think about the overall process again.

The target has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to cyclohexane. So perhaps the alkyne is converted into a methyl group, which is then oxidized to a formyl group, while another part is modified to form the hydroxymethyl group.

But wait, oxidation of a methyl group (CH3) to a formyl (CHO) requires a strong oxidizing agent, like KMnO4 under acidic conditions.

Wait, let me think about the steps in option C:

Step 1: Alkylation to form cyclohexane-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Full hydrogenation of the alkyne to a single bond: cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me.

Step 3: Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. But ozonolysis requires a double bond. So unless step 2 didn't fully hydrogenate, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the step.

Wait, maybe step 2 in option C is not hydrogenation. Wait, the option says H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Pd on CaCO3 is usually for hydrogenation, but perhaps it's for something else.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation of a different functional group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the part where the cyclohexane ring undergoes some substitution or addition. Maybe the alkyne is converted into a diol, which then forms a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an epoxide, which upon ring-opening forms a diol, which then is oxidized.

But again, the options don't have an epoxidation step, so probably not.

Alternative plan: Let's think about the target molecule. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The main ring has a substituent that is a CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group and a CHO group.

So, perhaps the synthesis involves adding a methyl group to the alkyne, then introducing an oxygen to form the hydroxymethyl group, and then oxidizing a CH2 group to CHO.

Wait, but how would that happen?

Another approach: Maybe the alkyne is first converted into a ketone, then the ketone is used to form a secondary alcohol, which upon oxidation becomes a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the reagents again.

Looking at option D:

After step 1 (NaNH2, methanol), perhaps the acetylide is formed and then reacts with methanol. But I'm not sure. Then step 2 is Li in NH3, which is a strong base. Maybe this is for deprotonating a compound to form a strong base, which could then attack somewhere else.

Alternatively, perhaps Li/NH3 is used for alkyne to alkene conversion, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the target's structure comes from a cyclopropane intermediate. For example, if the alkyne is converted into a cyclopropane via some reaction, then upon ring-opening, forms the necessary substituents. But I don't recall any such reaction in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is used in a conjugate addition to form a substituent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider each option's steps in order and see which sequence could lead to the target molecule.

Let me try option B:

Step 1: NaNH2, ethyl chloride. So, acetylide formed and then ethylated to cyclohexane-C≡C-Et.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. This could be a deprotonation or elimination. Maybe converting the alkyne into an alkene. So, cyclohexane-C≡C-Et becomes cyclohexane-C=C-Et.

Step 3: Ozonolysis with H2O. Ozonolysis would cleave the C=C into two carbonyl groups. So, cyclohexane-C=C-Et would become cyclohexanone and acetaldehyde.

Step 4: NH4OH. Perhaps this is a work-up to form the aldehyde from the ozonolysis products.

But the target has a hydroxymethyl group, so perhaps I'm missing a step that adds the hydroxyl group.

Wait, maybe after ozonolysis, the main ring has a carbonyl group (cyclohexanone), and the ethyl part becomes an aldehyde. But the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to the ring, not an aldehyde.

Hmm, this isn't matching up.

Another thought: Perhaps the hydroxymethyl group comes from an epoxide opening. If somewhere in the steps, an epoxide is formed and then opened with acid to form a diol, which is then treated to form the hydroxymethyl group.

But the options don't have an epoxidation step, so perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, looking back at the target, the substituents are a hydroxymethylcyclohexyl and a formyl group on cyclohexane. So, perhaps the formyl group is from the alkyne being converted into a formyl group via oxidation.

But how?

Wait, another approach: Maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then oxidized to a formyl group. For that, we need to hydrogenate the alkyne to a ketone. But I don't see a reagent in the options that would do that.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone via a hydrohalogenation and elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via a process like oxymercuration, but that's not in the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think about each option's sequence.

Option C:

Steps:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: cyclohexane-C≡C-Me
2. H2/Pd: cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me
3. O3/(CH3)2S: but unless there's a double bond, ozonolysis won't do much. So perhaps step 3 isn't applicable. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation in step 2 doesn't go to completion, leaving a double bond. But that's not indicated in the option.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is partial, giving a cis double bond. Then ozonolysis would cleave it.

Wait, let's imagine that after step 2, we have a double bond in the side chain. So, cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me is not correct; perhaps it's cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. No, that's not right. Wait, no, the alkyne after hydrogenation would become a single bond, so maybe I'm thinking wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a way to introduce both the formyl and hydroxymethyl groups. Let's think about the steps that could introduce those.

For the formyl group (CHO), perhaps ozonolysis of a double bond would work. For the hydroxymethyl group, perhaps a substitution or addition reaction.

Wait, let me think about the target's structure again. The main ring has a CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group and a CHO group. So, perhaps the main ring is formed via a ring-opening of an epoxide or via a substitution.

Alternatively, maybe the main ring is formed via a Grignard addition, but that's a stretch.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone, which then undergoes a cycloaddition. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is used in a Sonogashira coupling to add an aryl group, but that's not in the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Let me try to imagine the steps in option C:

1. Alkyne becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-Me.

2. Hydrogenation gives cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. Ozonolysis: Wait, but how? Unless there's a double bond, ozonolysis won't do anything. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe after step 2, there's a double bond somewhere else. Alternatively, perhaps step 3 involves breaking a ring to form a double bond.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should think about each option's possible outcome.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol: Maybe the acetylide is formed, but methanol doesn't alkylate, so perhaps it's for something else. Maybe it's for a substitution, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a way to form a ketone. Wait, but I don't see how.

2. Li in NH3: Maybe deprotonation. But I'm not sure what this would accomplish.

3. Ozonolysis: Again, needs a double bond.

4. Work-up with NH4OH.

Not sure.

Option A:

After step 1: cyclohexane-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: H2/Pd. Hydrogenate to CH2-CH2-Me.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2. Maybe elimination to form a double bond. So, cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me with a double bond? But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, which could eliminate H2O, but where would the water come from? Perhaps the molecule has a hydroxyl group, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is for epoxidation, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: Let me think about the target molecule again.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

So, the main ring is cyclohexane with two substituents: a formyl group (CHO) and a hydroxymethylcyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps the hydroxymethyl group is formed via a substitution where a methyl group is oxidized to a hydroxymethyl group, but that requires specific conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxymethyl group is formed via an epoxide ring-opening.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a formyl group via a series of steps. For example, adding a methyl group, then hydrogenation, then oxidation.

But how? Let me think:

Step 1: Alkylation of the alkyne to form cyclohexane-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: Reduce the alkyne to a CH2 group: cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me.

Step 3: Ozonolysis wouldn't work here because there's no double bond.

Step 4: Perhaps oxidize the CH2 group to a CHO.

Wait, but oxidation of a CH2 group adjacent to a ring would require specific conditions. Perhaps using KMnO4 under acidic conditions would oxidize a benzyl-type CH2 group to a carbonyl, but cyclohexane isn't aromatic. So maybe not.

Wait, but KMnO4 in acidic conditions can oxidize certain saturated bonds. For example, if the CH2 group is part of a more substituted structure, it might oxidize. But in this case, it's just cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me.

Hmm, this is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should look for the correct sequence that introduces both the formyl and hydroxymethyl groups.

Another angle: The target has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Maybe the formyl comes from an ozonolysis of a double bond, and the hydroxymethyl comes from an epoxide ring-opening.

Looking at the options, option C's step 3 is ozonolysis, which could form the formyl group. Then, the Ba(OH)2 in step 4 could form the hydroxymethyl group via some kind of elimination or addition.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option's steps and their possible outcomes.

Option C:

1. Alkylation gives cyclohexane-C≡C-Me.

2. Hydrogenation reduces the alkyne to a single bond: cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. Ozonolysis: requires a double bond, but since there's none, perhaps this step isn't applicable. So maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 isn't a hydrogenation but something else. Wait, the catalyst is Pd-calcium carbonate, which is a common catalyst for hydrogenation. So step 2 likely hydrogenates the alkyne.

So, after step 2, we have cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me. Then, step 3 would be ozonolysis, which requires a double bond, but without one, this step doesn't make sense. So perhaps option C isn't the right choice.

Option B:

After step 1, we have cyclohexane-C≡C-Et.

Step 2: Li in NH3. Maybe this deprotonates and eliminates to form an alkene: cyclohexane-C=C-Et.

Step 3: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into two carbonyls. So, the main ring would have a carbonyl group (cyclohexanone) and the ethyl part would form an aldehyde (CH3CHO).

But the target has a hydroxymethyl group, not a carbonyl on the main ring.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the aldehyde from the ethyl group is the formyl group in the target. So, after ozonolysis, we have cyclohexanone and ethanal.

But the target doesn't have a ketone; it has a formyl group. So, perhaps in step 4, the cyclohexanone is reduced or transformed into something else.

Alternatively, maybe the main ring's carbonyl is further modified.

But I'm not sure.

Option D:

After step 1, perhaps the acetylide reacts with methanol to form an ether, but I don't see how that leads to the target.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck and need to think differently. Let me think about which options include steps that could form a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.

Ozonolysis can form a formyl group if the double bond is at the end. For example, if we have a CH2=CH2 group, ozonolysis would give two formyl groups.

So, perhaps the target's formyl group comes from ozonolysis of a terminal double bond.

Looking at the options, option C's step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive work-up that gives aldehydes and ketones.

So, perhaps in option C:

After step 1: cyclohexane-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: Hydrogenate to cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me.

But that's a single bond. So, no double bond for ozonolysis. So how does step 3 work? It doesn't, unless I'm missing a step that forms a double bond.

Wait, perhaps step 3 is ozonolysis of a different double bond formed elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the initial steps form a double bond in a different part of the molecule.

Wait, maybe the ring undergoes a ring-opening to form a diene, but that's a stretch.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is option C, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: The target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane ring. How can that be formed? Perhaps via a Grignard reaction adding a CH2OH group, but that's not among the reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps it's formed via a substitution where a methyl group is replaced by a hydroxymethyl group. But that would require a leaving group, which isn't present in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 in option C is used for elimination, forming an alkene, which is then used in a dihydroxylation to form a diol, which upon oxidation forms the formyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxide formation, but that's not standard.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the steps.

The target has a formyl group, which suggests ozonolysis was used, as that forms aldehydes. So options that include ozonolysis (options B, C, D) are more likely.

Looking at option C, the steps are alkylation, hydrogenation, ozonolysis, Ba(OH)2.

After alkylation (step 1), we have cyclohexane-C≡C-Me.

Hydrogenation (step 2) gives cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me.

But ozonolysis (step 3) requires a double bond, which isn't present. So perhaps this isn't the right option.

Option B includes ozonolysis, but after Li in NH3 which could form an alkene.

So, step 1: cyclohexane-C≡C-Et.

Step 2: Li in NH3 converts to cyclohexane-C=C-Et.

Step 3: Ozonolysis cleaves into two carbonyls.

So, the main ring would have a carbonyl group, which could be oxidized further, but the target has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option C.

Wait, after step 2, cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me, then step 3 is ozonolysis. Wait, perhaps the molecule has a ring-opening to form a double bond. For example, the hydrogenation could break the ring, but that would change the structure significantly, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a trans double bond, which upon ozonolysis would cleave into two carbonyls.

Wait, but without a double bond, ozonolysis won't work.

I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should consider that after alkylation and hydrogenation, a double bond is formed elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, as it includes ozonolysis which would form the aldehyde group.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C.

But I'm not confident. Another approach: Let me think about the target. It has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is on the main cyclohexane. So, perhaps the hydroxymethyl group comes from an epoxide ring-opening, and the formyl comes from ozonolysis.

But none of the options include epoxidation.

Hmm, I'm going to have to make a guess here. Based on the steps, option C seems to have ozonolysis which would form the aldehyde, and Ba(OH)2 might form the hydroxymethyl group via elimination and ring-opening.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The target molecule, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, consists of a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane ring and a formyl group. Starting from ethynylcyclohexane, the synthesis must achieve both functionalization of the alkyne and introduction of these substituents.

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which reacts with methyl chloride to give cyclohexane-C≡C-Me.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, resulting in cyclohexane-CH₂-CH₂-Me.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, potentially for elimination, but no clear pathway to form the hydroxymethyl or formyl groups.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Acidic hydration, but no evidence of forming the desired substituents.

This sequence does not provide a clear path to the target molecule.

---

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which reacts with ethyl chloride to give cyclohexane-C≡C-Et.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, potentially converts the alkyne into an alkene (cyclohexane-C=C-Et).
3. **O₃, H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond, forming two carbonyl groups. The main ring would likely form a ketone (cyclohexanone), and the ethyl group would form an aldehyde (CH₃CHO).
4. **NH₄OH**: Work-up, but no clear formation of the hydroxymethyl group.

This sequence partially aligns with forming a formyl group but fails to account for the hydroxymethyl group.

---

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which reacts with methyl chloride to give cyclohexane-C≡C-Me.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, resulting in cyclohexane-CH₂-CH₂-Me.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is absent after full hydrogenation. This step is unclear in achieving the desired product.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, potentially for elimination or forming the hydroxymethyl group, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the target.

This sequence is incomplete due to the lack of a double bond for ozonolysis.

---

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, but methanol is a poor electrophile for alkylation. The purpose of this step is unclear.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, potentially for deprotonation or elimination, but no clear transformation is evident.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is absent in this sequence.
4. **NH₄OH**: Work-up, but no evidence of forming the desired substituents.

This sequence does not provide a clear pathway to the target molecule.

---

### Conclusion:
The target molecule requires the introduction of both a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Ozonolysis (as in Options B, C, and D) is a plausible method for forming the formyl group, but none of the options fully account for the formation of the hydroxymethyl group. Among the options, **Option C** includes ozonolysis, which aligns with forming the formyl group, and Ba(OH)₂, which might contribute to forming the hydroxymethyl group. Despite uncertainties in the sequence, Option C is the most plausible.
