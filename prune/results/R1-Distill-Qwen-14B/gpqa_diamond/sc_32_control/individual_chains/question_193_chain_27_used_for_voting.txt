Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance. The given relation is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, which I think is written as N ∝ 1/parallax^5. Parallax is usually denoted by 'plx', so N ∝ 1/plx^5.

Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d) in parsecs, right? So plx = 1/d. That means as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The question asks about the number of stars per unit range of distance. So they're asking how N changes as r (distance) increases.

Wait, let me think. If N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/d, then substituting that in, N would be proportional to (d)^5. Because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, that's N in terms of distance.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit distance. So is it the differential, like dN/dr? Because the question says "change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

So if N ∝ d^5, then dN/dr would be the derivative of N with respect to d. Let's compute that. If N = k * d^5 for some constant k, then dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) would be proportional to d^4.

Wait, but the options are about how it changes with r. Let me make sure.

The options are:

A) ~ r^3

B) ~ r^5

C) ~ r^4

D) ~ r^2

So according to my calculation, the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, did I get that right? Let me double-check.

Parallax plx = 1/r (since r is distance in parsecs, I think). So if N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, substituting plx = 1/r, N = k * (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range, which is the change in N per change in r. So I need the derivative of N with respect to r.

dN/dr = 5 kr^4. So yes, the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4. So the correct option is C.

The question asks how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance, given that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( r \)) as \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this into the given relation, \( N \propto r^5 \).

The question specifically asks for the number of stars per unit range of distance, which corresponds to the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto r^5 \), we find \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).

Among the options provided:
- A) \( \sim r^3 \): Incorrect, as the proportionality is not cubic.
- B) \( \sim r^5 \): Incorrect, as this represents the total number of stars, not per unit distance.
- C) \( \sim r^4 \): Correct, as shown by the derivative.
- D) \( \sim r^2 \): Incorrect, as the proportionality is not quadratic.

Thus, the correct answer is \( \sim r^4 \).
