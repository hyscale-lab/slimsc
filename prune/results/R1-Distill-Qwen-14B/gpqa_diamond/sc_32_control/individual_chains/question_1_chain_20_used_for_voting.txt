Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Let me try to break it down. So, the question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given: 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, with various exponents of 10 and eV.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle comes into play when dealing with the lifetime and energy of particles. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of Planck's constant over 2π, which is ħ. So the formula would be ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2π. But wait, I think the exact formula is ΔE * τ ≈ ħ, where τ is the lifetime, which is the uncertainty in time. Or maybe it's ħ/(2π). I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact constants, but I'll proceed with what I remember.

So the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime. The longer the lifetime (more precisely, the longer the time over which the state is observed), the smaller the uncertainty in energy. So for two states to be clearly distinguished, their energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, we can't tell them apart—they'd blur together.

Wait, but each state has its own lifetime. How does that affect the energy uncertainty? Oh, right. Each state has its own energy uncertainty. So for each state, ΔE = ħ / τ. But wait, another thought: when considering transitions between states, the lifetime of each state contributes to the uncertainty in the energy difference. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the two states have different lifetimes, their individual uncertainties would be different. But for the energy difference between them to be resolvable, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Or perhaps it's the uncertainty in the difference that's the combination of both uncertainties.

Let me think again. The energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1. The uncertainty in ΔE would be the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual uncertainties, assuming the uncertainties are independent. So ΔE_total ≈ sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ). But maybe since the lifetimes are different, the uncertainties are ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 and ΔE2 = ħ / τ2.

Wait, but wait. The energy uncertainty for each state is determined by their own lifetime. So E1 has an uncertainty ΔE1 = ħ / τ1, and E2 has ΔE2 = ħ / τ2. When we take the difference E2 - E1, the uncertainty in this difference would be the combination of the two uncertainties. Assuming they are independent, the uncertainty in the difference (ΔΔE) would be sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ). So for the energy difference to be clearly distinguishable, the actual energy difference (ΔE) should be greater than this combined uncertainty.

Alternatively, maybe the combined uncertainty is the sum of the individual uncertainties. But which is it? Let's recall that when you add two independent uncertainties, you add their squares for the total uncertainty. So that's the case when they are uncorrelated. So I think the correct way is the square root of the sum of squares.

So let's proceed with that. Let me write down the numbers. The lifetimes are τ1 = 1e-9 sec and τ2 = 1e-8 sec. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = (1.0545718e-34) / (1e-8) = 1.0545718e-26 J.

Wait, but wait a second. The energy is in Joules, but the options are in eV. I should convert these to eV to match the options.

I know that 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So to convert J to eV, divide by 1.602e-19.

So ΔE1 in eV is (1.0545718e-25 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ (1.0545718e-25) / (1.602e-19) ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

Wait, let me compute that again. 1.05457e-25 / 1.602e-19 → let's compute the exponents. 1e-25 / 1e-19 is 1e-6. 1.05457/1.602 ≈ approximately 0.658. So 0.658e-6 eV → 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 is 1.05457e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV → 1e-26 / 1e-19 = 1e-7. 1.05457/1.602 ≈ 0.658, so 0.658e-7 eV, which is 6.58e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV, ΔE2 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait, but wait. The energy difference ΔE between the two states must be larger than the combined uncertainty to be resolvable. So the combined uncertainty is sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ). Let's compute that.

ΔE1 = 6.58e-7 eV → (6.58e-7)^2 ≈ (4.32e-13) (eV)^2.

ΔE2 = 6.58e-8 eV → (6.58e-8)^2 ≈ (4.33e-15) (eV)^2.

Sum: 4.32e-13 + 4.33e-15 ≈ approximately 4.36e-13. Square root of that is sqrt(4.36e-13) ≈ 6.6e-7 eV.

Wait, because 4.36e-13 is when we take 6.58e-7 squared plus 6.58e-8 squared. Wait, but when you square 6.58e-7, you get (6.58)^2 is about 43.3, times 1e-14 (since (1e-7)^2 is 1e-14) → 43.3e-14 = 4.33e-13. Similarly, 6.58e-8 squared is (43.3) * 1e-16 → 4.33e-15. So when adding 4.33e-13 and 4.33e-15, it's 4.33e-13 + 0.0433e-13 = 4.3733e-13. The square root is sqrt(4.3733e-13) ≈ let's see, sqrt(4.3733) is about 2.09, so 2.09e-6.5 → wait, no, wait. Wait, sqrt(4.3733e-13) is the same as sqrt(4.3733) * sqrt(1e-13) → which is about 2.09 * 1e-6.5? No, wait, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-7)^2, so sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2.09 * 3.16e-7 = approximately 6.6e-7 eV.

So the combined uncertainty is about 6.6e-7 eV.

Therefore, the energy difference between E2 and E1, ΔE, must be greater than 6.6e-7 eV for them to be clearly distinguished.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 is smaller than 6.6e-7 → too small.

Option B) 1e-11 eV → way too small.

Option C) 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is much larger than 6.6e-7 → so this would be resolvable.

Option D) 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is smaller than 6.6e-7 → not enough.

So the correct answer would be option C, 1e-4 eV.

To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) to the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) as:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \hbar
\]

Here, \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)), and \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state. For two states with lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), the energy uncertainties are:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
\]

To convert these to electron volts (eV), we use the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

The combined uncertainty in the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is given by:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{(\Delta E_1)^2 + (\Delta E_2)^2}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{(6.58 \times 10^{-7})^2 + (6.58 \times 10^{-8})^2}
\]

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} \approx \sqrt{4.33 \times 10^{-13} + 4.33 \times 10^{-15}} \approx \sqrt{4.37 \times 10^{-13}} \approx 6.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

For the two energy levels to be clearly distinguishable, the actual energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \). Evaluating the options:

- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: Too small, as it is less than \( 6.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: Too small, as it is much less than \( 6.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: Sufficiently large, as it is much greater than \( 6.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: Too small, as it is less than \( 6.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

Thus, the energy difference must be at least \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to ensure the two energy levels are clearly distinguishable.
