Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about elemental abundances in stars. Hmm, let's see what the question says. 

Alright, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I don't think the mass will directly affect the ratio of elements in their photospheres since the question is about their compositions. 

The given data are the elemental abundances determined using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width method. The values are:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

I remember that the square brackets in these notations mean logarithmic abundances relative to a reference star, usually the Sun. The formula for [X/Y] is log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X / n_Y)_sun. So a positive value means X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12= -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- Similarly for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log10(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH =10^(-5)

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, [n_Si(Star1) / n_Si(Star2)] or maybe the ratio of their silicon to some other element? Wait, no, the problem says the ratio of silicon atoms, so probably [n_Si1 / n_Si2].

Wait, the question says, "ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So that's n_Si1 / n_Si2.

But how do I find n_Si for each star?

I think I can use the given abundance ratios to find n_Si relative to H for each star.

Let me outline the approach for each star.

Starting with Star_1:

Given [Fe/H]_1 = 0. That means [Fe/H] = log10(n_Fe1 / n_H1) - log10(n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) =0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

So the ratio of Fe to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun.

Wait, but the Sun's [Fe/H] is 0 by definition. So Star_1 has the same Fe abundance as the Sun.

Also, given [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. So [Si/Fe] is the logarithm of (n_Si1/n_Fe1) divided by (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun).

Wait, wait, the definition is [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

So [Si/Fe]_1 = log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) - log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) =0.3

We know n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun → n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1.

Wait, but since in Star_1, n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1 → n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) * n_H1.

Similarly, the Sun's n_Fe/n_H is 10^(-4.5). So n_Fe1 = n_H1 * (10^(-4.5)).

Wait, because [Fe/H]_1 is 0 → [Fe/H] = log(n_Fe1/n_H1) - log(n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) =0 → log(n_Fe1/n_H1) = log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

So for Star_1, n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) * n_H1.

But I think it's easier to work in terms of ratios relative to H because the Sun's composition is given.

Let me compute the ratios for each element in each star.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1=0 → Fe abundance same as Sun relative to H.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → So Si is more abundant than Fe by 10^0.3 ≈ 2 times relative to Fe.

Wait, because [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X_sun/n_Y_sun) =0.3 → n_X/n_Y = (n_X_sun/n_Y_sun) *10^0.3.

So, for Star_1:

n_Si1/n_Fe1 = (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But from the Sun's data, n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun = 10^(-4.5), and n_Si_sun is not directly given, but perhaps I can compute it.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratios of elements relative to H.

Alternatively, perhaps express each element's abundance relative to H, and then find the ratios.

Let me think again.

Let me denote the following:

For the Sun:

n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun = 10^(-4.5) → [Fe/H]_sun = 0 by definition.

n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun = 10^(-5) → because 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Wait, the Sun's data is given as:

12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) =-4.5 → nFe/nH =1e-4.5.

Similarly, log10(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So now, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1=0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun → n_Fe1 = n_H1 * (1e-4.5).

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → So (n_Si1/n_Fe1) = (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3.

Because [Si/Fe] = log(n_Si/n_Fe) - log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) =0.3 → n_Si/n_Fe = (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3.

So rearranged, n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But n_Fe1 is (n_H1 * 1e-4.5 ), so substitute:

n_Si1 = (1e-4.5 * n_H1) * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) * 1e^0.3.

Wait, but I don't have n_Si_sun.

Wait, but perhaps I can express n_Si_sun in terms of n_Fe_sun and another ratio.

Wait, perhaps it's better to find the ratio of Si to H in Star_1.

Because n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3 * n_Fe1.

But n_Fe1 = n_H1 * (1e-4.5).

Wait, perhaps express everything in terms of H.

So, n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3 * n_Fe1.

But n_Fe1 = (n_H1) * (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) → because [Fe/H]=0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

So substituting, n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) *1e0.3 * (n_H1 * (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun)) )

Simplify this:

n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) * 1e0.3 * (n_H1 * n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun )

n_Fe_sun cancels out:

n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun) * 1e0.3 * (n_H1 / n_H_sun )

So now, n_Si1 / n_H1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) *1e0.3.

Which means [Si/H]_1 = log(n_Si1/n_H1) - log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) ) → which would be log( (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun *1e0.3) ) - log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) → 0.3.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute [Si/H]_1.

Because [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 and [Fe/H]_1=0.

Hmm, perhaps I can use the fact that [Si/H] = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H] → [Si/H]_1 =0.3 +0=0.3.

Yes, that makes sense. Because [X/H] = [X/Y] + [Y/H].

So for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 =0.3 +0=0.3.

So log(n_Si1/n_H1) = log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) +0.3 → n_Si1/n_H1 = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) *10^0.3.

So n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) *1e0.3 *n_H1.

Similarly, for Star_2, let's process.

Given [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

So [Mg/H]_2 =0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 =n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun.

So [Mg/Si]_2 = log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) =0.3 → n_Mg2/n_Si2 = (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun ) *10^0.3.

But I can also find [Mg/Si]_2 in terms of [Mg/H]_2 and [Si/H]_2.

Wait, perhaps express [Mg/Si] as [Mg/H] - [Si/H], because:

[Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H].

So [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 → 0.3=0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So for Star_2, [Si/H] is -0.3.

Thus, log(n_Si2/n_H2) = log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) -0.3 → n_Si2/n_H2 = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) *10^(-0.3).

So now, I have expressions for n_Si1 and n_Si2 in terms of their H.

We need to find the ratio (n_Si1 / n_Si2).

n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) *1e0.3 *n_H1.

n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) *1e-0.3 *n_H2.

So ratio (n_Si1 / n_Si2) = [ (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun *1e0.3 *n_H1) ] / [ (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun *1e-0.3 *n_H2) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= (1e0.3 * n_H1) / (1e-0.3 *n_H2 )

= (1e0.3 / 1e-0.3 ) * (n_H1 / n_H2 )

= 1e(0.3 +0.3) * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

= 1e0.6 * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

But what's n_H1 and n_H2? Oh wait, the problem doesn't give any information about the total hydrogen content of the stars. Hmm, but perhaps the hydrogen content is the same as the Sun's? Or maybe I can assume that [H] is the same, but that's not given.

Wait, but I think that the photospheric composition uses the same reference for H. Because in stellar atmospheres, [X/H] is the logarithm of (n_X/n_H) relative to the Sun. So if the stars have the same [H], their n_H would scale in a certain way.

Wait, but in this problem, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → same as Sun. So n_Fe1/n_H1 =n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun. Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 =n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun.

But I don't have any other information about the [H] in the stars beyond that. However, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms, which is n_Si1 /n_Si2.

Wait, but in the expressions I derived earlier, the ratio depends on (n_H1 /n_H2). Since I don't know n_H1 and n_H2, perhaps I can find a way to express this ratio without needing the actual H counts.

Wait, but I think I might have missed something. The problem gives [Fe/H]_1 and [Mg/H]_2. So for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, which tells me that the hydrogen content is such that n_Fe1/n_H1 is same as Sun. Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H] is 0, so n_Mg2/n_H2 is same as Sun.

But I don't have [H] for Star_1 and Star_2. So perhaps I can consider that the total number of H in each star is the same as the Sun? No, I don't think that's a valid assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is structured such that the ratio (n_H1 /n_H2) cancels out.

Wait, looking back at the ratio:

n_Si1 /n_Si2 = (1e0.6) * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

If I can find n_H1 /n_H2 somehow.

Wait, perhaps I can relate n_H1 and n_H2 through another ratio.

Wait, for Star_1, n_Fe1 = n_H1 * (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) → since [Fe/H]_1=0.

Similarly, for Star_2, n_Mg2 =n_H2 * (n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun )

But I don't see a direct way to connect n_H1 and n_H2. Hmm.

Wait, unless I can find [H] in each star. But the problem doesn't give [H] for Star_1 or Star_2 beyond the given elements.

Wait, perhaps I can find [H] for the stars, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms. So perhaps the ratio is independent of the total H in each star. But how?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me write the ratio again.

n_Si1 / n_Si2 = (n_Si1 /n_H1) * (n_H1 /n_H2) * (n_H2 /n_Si2 )

Wait, no, that's not helpful. Alternatively, since n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) *1e0.3 *n_H1,

and n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) *1e-0.3 *n_H2,

then n_Si1 /n_Si2 = (1e0.3 *n_H1) / (1e-0.3 *n_H2 )

= (1e0.6) * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

So the ratio depends on (n_H1 /n_H2).

But without knowing the ratio of H in the stars, how can I proceed?

Wait, but perhaps the H content is the same in both stars as in the Sun. Is that a valid assumption? The problem doesn't specify, but maybe I can assume that. If [Fe/H]_1 =0, that means Fe is same as Sun, but H could vary. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the H variation, which might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't require the H ratio. Wait, perhaps I'm missing another relation.

Wait, perhaps I can find the ratio (n_H1 /n_H2) using the information from the stars' other abundances.

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0 means that the ratio n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 =n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun.

But perhaps I can relate n_H1 and n_H2 via another element, but I don't have any other abundance data.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the problem does not require knowing n_H1 and n_H2, because the ratio of Si in the stars depends on their [Si/H] and the ratio of [H] in each.

Wait, but maybe the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 can be expressed as ( [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 ) + something else.

Wait, another thought: The ratio of Si in the photospheres (n_Si1 /n_Si2) can be found using their [Si/H] values and the ratio of their H abundances.

Wait, [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_H1) = log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) +0.3 → n_Si1/n_H1 = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) *10^0.3.

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 =-0.3 → n_Si2/n_H2 = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) *10^-0.3.

So, the ratio (n_Si1/n_Si2 ) = (n_Si1/n_H1 )/(n_Si2/n_H2 ) * (n_H2 /n_H1 )

Wait, because (n_Si1/n_Si2) = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H1/n_Si2) → no, not quite. Let me think again.

Wait, (n_Si1/n_Si2) = (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2 ) * (n_H2/n_H1 )

Because:

n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) *1e0.3 *n_H1.

n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) *1e-0.3 *n_H2.

So,

n_Si1 / n_Si2 = (1e0.3 *n_H1 ) / (1e-0.3 *n_H2 ) ) = (1e0.6 ) * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

So, the ratio depends on (n_H1 /n_H2 )

But I don't have this ratio. Wait, perhaps I can find it through another element. Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 =n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun → n_Fe1 = n_H1 * (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun )

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0 → n_Mg2 =n_H2 * (n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun )

But I don't see a connection between Fe and Mg. Unless I can find the ratio of Fe and Mg in the stars somehow.

Wait, perhaps I can relate n_H1 and n_H2 via the abundances of Fe and Mg.

Wait, but I don't have [Fe/Mg] for either star. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the total number of elements is the same, but I don't think that's a valid assumption.

Wait, unless I can relate the number densities of H in each star through another element's abundance.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio (n_H1/n_H2) is 1, meaning the same number of H atoms in both stars. But that's probably not correct, as the stars could have different abundances.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think again.

The problem is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of the two stars: n_Si1 /n_Si2.

From the earlier steps, I have:

n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) *1e0.3 *n_H1.

n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) *1e-0.3 *n_H2.

So,

n_Si1 /n_Si2 = (1e0.3 /1e-0.3 ) * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

= 1e0.6 * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

But I don't know n_H1 and n_H2, so perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the hydrogen in each star is the same as the Sun's? Because [Fe/H]_1=0 and [Mg/H]_2=0. Or perhaps, the number of H atoms is the same in both stars.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider the ratio in terms of the Sun's H.

n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) *1e0.3 *n_H1.

n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) *1e-0.3 *n_H2.

So the ratio is (1e0.6 ) * (n_H1/n_H2 )

But we don't know (n_H1/n_H2 ). So how can I proceed?

Wait, perhaps I can find (n_H1/n_H2 ) using another element. For example, using Fe in Star_1 and Mg in Star_2.

Wait, for Star_1:

n_Fe1 = n_H1 * (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun )

For Star_2:

n_Mg2 =n_H2 * (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun )

But without knowing [Fe/Mg] in either star, I can't relate Fe and Mg.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of H atoms in each star relative to the Sun.

Let me denote:

For Star_1, n_H1 = x * n_H_sun.

For Star_2, n_H2 = y * n_H_sun.

So, x and y are factors by which the number of H atoms in each star differs from the Sun.

Then, n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) *1e0.3 * x *n_H_sun = (n_Si_sun) *1e0.3 *x.

Similarly, n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) *1e-0.3 * y *n_H_sun = (n_Si_sun) *1e-0.3 *y.

So, the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 = (1e0.3 *x ) / (1e-0.3 * y ) = 1e0.6 * (x/y )

So, to find this ratio, I need x/y.

But x and y are the factors for H in each star compared to the Sun. How can I find x and y?

Wait, looking back at the given data, for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 =n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun → but n_Fe1 =n_H1 * (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) → since [Fe/H]_1=0.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0 → n_Mg2 =n_H2 * (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun )

But I don't know if any other information can relate x and y.

Wait, perhaps I can find the ratio (n_Fe1 / n_Mg2 ) in terms of x and y.

n_Fe1 = x *n_Fe_sun.

n_Mg2 = y *n_Mg_sun.

So, n_Fe1/n_Mg2 = (x/y) * (n_Fe_sun /n_Mg_sun )

But without knowing the ratio of Fe and Mg in the Sun, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the Sun's n_Fe and n_Mg are known.

From the data given:

n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun =1e-4.5.

n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun =1e-5.

So, n_Fe_sun = (1e-4.5) *n_H_sun.

n_Mg_sun = (1e-5) *n_H_sun.

So, the ratio n_Fe_sun/n_Mg_sun = (1e-4.5)/(1e-5) )=10^0.5 ≈3.1623.

So, n_Fe_sun =3.1623 * n_Mg_sun.

Now, back to n_Fe1 and n_Mg2.

n_Fe1 =x *n_Fe_sun = x*3.1623 n_Mg_sun.

n_Mg2 = y *n_Mg_sun.

So, n_Fe1/n_Mg2 = (x *3.1623 n_Mg_sun )/( y n_Mg_sun ) ) = (3.1623 x )/ y.

But without any data on [Fe/Mg] in Star_1 or Star_2, I can't find this ratio.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the ratio (n_H1/n_H2) is 1, meaning that both stars have the same number of hydrogen atoms as the Sun. But that doesn't make sense because their [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are 0, which doesn't necessarily imply the same H as the Sun. Wait, no, because [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (n_Fe/n_H), so if [Fe/H] is 0, n_Fe/n_H = Sun's. But the total n_H can be different. So their [H] could vary.

Wait, perhaps the problem does not require the H ratio, and the ratio of Si is simply a function of their [Si/H] values.

Wait, but I'm stuck because the H ratio is needed. Let me think about the problem again.

The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of the two stars. So, n_Si1 /n_Si2.

We have for Star_1:

n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun *1e0.3 ) * (n_H1/n_H_sun )

Star_2:

n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun *1e-0.3 ) * (n_H2/n_H_sun )

Thus, their ratio is (1e0.6 ) * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

But without (n_H1 /n_H2 ), I can't proceed.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the earlier steps again.

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 =n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun → n_Fe1 =n_H1 * (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun )

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2 =n_H2 * (n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun )

Now, perhaps I can find the ratio (n_H1 /n_H2 ) through another element, perhaps O or C, but those data aren't given.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of H in the stars by considering the metallicity or other given data.

Wait, another approach: Since [Fe/H]_1=0 and [Mg/H]_2=0, perhaps the H in both stars is the same as the Sun, so n_H1 =n_H_sun and n_H2 =n_H_sun → so (n_H1/n_H2 )=1.

Wait, but [Fe/H]_1=0 means that in Star_1, Fe is as abundant relative to H as the Sun. But it doesn't necessarily mean that the H is the same, only that the ratio is the same. So, for example, if Star_1 had twice as much H as the Sun, but also twice as much Fe, then [Fe/H] would be 0.

So, to clarify, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (n_Fe/n_H) relative to the Sun. So, if Star_1 has the same [Fe/H] as the Sun, it doesn't imply that n_H is the same, just that n_Fe/n_H is the same.

In that case, our earlier approach is correct, but without knowing the H ratio, we can't find the exact value. So perhaps the problem is missing some data, but that can't be the case because it's a multiple-choice question. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing something in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I can find the ratio of H in each star by considering another element's abundance.

Wait, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → n_Si1 =n_Fe1 * (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun ) *1e0.3.

But n_Fe1 =n_H1 * (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun )

So, n_Si1 = n_H1 * (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun ) * (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun ) *1e0.3.

Simplify:

n_Si1 =n_H1 * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) *1e0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun ) =0.3 → n_Mg2/n_Si2 =n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun *1e0.3.

But for Star_2, n_Mg2 =n_H2 * (n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun )

So,

n_Mg2 =n_H2 * (n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun )

n_Si2 =n_Mg2 * (n_Si_sun/n_Mg_sun ) /1e0.3 → because rearranged from n_Mg2 =n_Si2 * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun ) *1e0.3 → n_Si2 =n_Mg2 * (n_Si_sun/n_Mg_sun ) /1e0.3.

Substituting n_Mg2:

n_Si2 = (n_H2 *n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun ) * (n_Si_sun/n_Mg_sun ) /1e0.3

Simplify:

n_Si2 =n_H2 * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) * 1e-0.3.

Which matches our earlier result.

So, going back, the ratio of Si is 1e0.6 * (n_H1/n_H2 )

But without knowing n_H1/n_H2, how can I find this ratio?

Wait, perhaps the problem requires us to assume that the H content in each star is the same as in the Sun. Let me test that assumption.

If n_H1 =n_H_sun → x=1.

n_H2 =n_H_sun → y=1.

Then, (n_H1/n_H2 )=1.

So, the ratio is 1e0.6 *1 =1e0.6 ≈3.98 → approximately 4.

Which matches option A (~3.9).

But wait, why can we assume that? Because the problem doesn't explicitly state that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects this approach, otherwise the problem can't be solved without more data.

So, under the assumption that n_H1 =n_H2 =n_H_sun, the ratio is ~3.98.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9.

So the answer would be A.

To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the relationships between logarithmic abundances relative to hydrogen ([X/H]) and relative to each other ([X/Y]).

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]₁ = 0 → \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe, sun}} / n_{\text{H, sun}} \).
   - [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3 → \( n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Fe,1}} = (n_{\text{Si, sun}} / n_{\text{Fe, sun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3} \).
   - Using [Si/H] = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H], we find [Si/H]₁ = 0.3.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]₂ = 0 → \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg, sun}} / n_{\text{H, sun}} \).
   - [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3 → \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{Si,2}} = (n_{\text{Mg, sun}} / n_{\text{Si, sun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3} \).
   - Using [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H], we find [Si/H]₂ = -0.3.

### Silicon Abundance Ratios:
For Star_1:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Si, sun}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}} \cdot 10^{0.3}.
\]

For Star_2:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Si, sun}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}} \cdot 10^{-0.3}.
\]

The ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}}{\frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}.
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}} \) and \( n_{\text{Si,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}} \):
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{\frac{n_{\text{Si, sun}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}} \cdot 10^{0.3}}{\frac{n_{\text{Si, sun}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}} \cdot 10^{-0.3}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}.
\]

Simplifying:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.6} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}.
\]

### Assumption for Hydrogen Ratio:
The problem does not provide explicit information about the total hydrogen content in the stars. To proceed, we assume that the hydrogen content in both stars is the same as in the Sun, i.e., \( n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{H, sun}} \). This simplifies the ratio to:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.6}.
\]

### Final Calculation:
\[
10^{0.6} \approx 3.98.
\]

Thus, the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

### Answer:
**A) ~3.9**
