Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given concentration is 0.02 M, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D. 

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium in a 1:1 ratio. So the complex here is Ca-EDTA, and the formula would be something like CaY²- where Y is the EDTA. The problem states it's a stoichiometric solution, which I think means that all the calcium is tied up in the complex. Or wait, does that mean the concentrations are in exact molar ratios? Like, the solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, so the concentration of that complex is 0.02 M.

Wait, but we're asked about the free calcium ions. Because in solution, some of the Ca-EDTA complex might dissociate. Oh wait no, the problem says the pH is ideal. Oh, right, EDTA's ability to form complexes depends on the pH because it affects its deprotonation. Since the pH is ideal, maybe we can assume that the EDTA is in its correct protonated form to form the complex, so the dissociation is minimal. But wait, wait. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. The Ca-EDTA complex is given, and we need to find the concentration of free calcium ions. 

I think the formula for the formation constant K would be helpful here. The formation constant K is given by K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y⁴−]). Wait, but wait, EDTA has different forms depending on pH. Oh, but the problem says pH is ideal, so maybe [Y⁴−] is known or can be considered as a constant. Alternatively, perhaps in this problem, we're to assume that the EDTA is fully deprotonated, so Y⁴- is the dominant species. But wait, maybe I don't need to worry about that because the problem gives the formation constant already. 

So, the formation constant K is 5x10^10. The solution has 0.02 M CaY²−. I need to find [Ca²+]. Let me write the expression. K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). 

Wait, but wait. The complex is CaY²−, so [CaY²−] is 0.02 M. So the denominator is [Ca²+][Y⁴−]. So, K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y⁴−]) = 5e10. 

But wait, if the solution is 0.02 M CaY²−, and assuming that the complex doesn't dissociate much, then [Ca²+] would be approximately zero. But that can't be right because the problem gives options. So perhaps in reality, some of the complex dissociates, giving a very small [Ca²+], which is what we need to calculate.

Wait, but if the solution is 0.02 M of the complex, and the K is very large (5e10), that suggests that the complex is very stable, meaning that the dissociation is minimal. So the concentration of free Ca²+ should be very low.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The formation constant K is given, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The larger the K, the more the complex forms. So for the reaction: Ca²+ + Y⁴− ↔ CaY²−. The K is [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y⁴−]) = 5e10.

But in this problem, the solution is 0.02 M CaY²−. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Now, when this complex dissociates a little, it releases Ca²+ and Y⁴−. Let me set up the variables.

Let’s assume that the concentration of the complex decreases by x, so [CaY²−] = 0.02 - x. But since K is very large, x will be very small compared to 0.02, so approximately, [CaY²−] ≈ 0.02. Then, the [Ca²+] = x, and [Y⁴−] = x. 

Wait, because each mole of complex dissociates into one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of Y⁴−, so [Ca²+] = x and [Y⁴−] = x. 

So substituting into K's equation: K = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10.

So 0.02 / x² = 5e10 → x² = 0.02/(5e10) → x² = 2e-12 → x = sqrt(2e-12) → approximately 4.47e-6 M. Wait, but that's about 4.5e-6 M, which is 4.5e-6 M. Hmm, looking at the options, none of them match that. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option C is 6.3e-7 M. Hmm, what if I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, wait, perhaps I got the initial assumption wrong. Let me think again. If the solution is 0.02 M CaY²−, and it's in equilibrium, then the initial [CaY²−] is 0.02 M, and the [Ca²+] and [Y⁴−] are both x. So K= 0.02/(x²) = 5e10 → x² = 0.02/(5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2 → 2e-2/(5e10) = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = approx 2e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. Oh wait, that's approximately 3.16e-7 M. Hmm, which is 3.16e-7, but that's not exactly an option. The options are C: 6.3e-7 and D: 1e-2, which is 0.01 M.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise. Let me compute sqrt(4e-13). So 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7. Oh, that's about 6.3e-7, which matches option C.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me recalculate. Because 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 equals (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5)*1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → 4e-13. So x^2 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * 1e-6.5 → 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M. So [Ca²+] is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is option C. 

Wait, but why would [Y⁴−] be equal to x? Because when each mole of CaY²− dissociates, it produces one mole each of Ca²+ and Y⁴−. So if the initial concentration is 0.02 M, and it dissociates x amount, then [Ca²+] = x, [Y⁴−] = x, and [CaY²−] = 0.02 - x. But if K is very large, x is very small, so [CaY²−] ≈ 0.02. So the approximation holds. 

So the correct answer should be option C, 6.3e-7 M. So option C is the answer.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex (CaY²⁻) with a formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we use the equilibrium expression for the dissociation of the complex:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the solution is 0.02 M CaY²⁻, we assume that the dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K \), so \([\text{CaY}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\). Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) and \([\text{Y}^{4-}]\), which are equal because the dissociation produces one mole of each per mole of complex. Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K = \frac{0.02}{x^2} = 5 \times 10^{10}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
