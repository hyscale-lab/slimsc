Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again carefully.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product. The options provided are A, B, C, D, each with a different structure.

First, let me look at the spectral data provided for Compound X. The IR and NMR data will be crucial for determining its structure.

Starting with the IR data:
- The peaks are in the ranges: 3400-2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1.

Breaking this down:
- The 3400-2500 cm-1 region usually indicates O-H stretching, but wait, that's a broad range. Alternatively, it could be N-H stretching for amines, but looking at the options, I don't see any amines. Another possibility is C-H stretching for alkenes or alkanes, but maybe that's not it. Or perhaps it's an O-H stretch from a carbonyl group, like a carboxylic acid or ester.

Wait, but the 1720 cm-1 peak is significant. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids usually have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm-1 and a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1. Esters also have a carbonyl around 1720-1740 cm-1. So maybe Compound X is a carboxylic acid or an ester.

Another peak in IR is 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1. These are likely due to aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound has an aromatic ring, probably with substituents.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm. That's a strong indication of an -OH proton, possibly from a carboxylic acid. Because in DMSO, the OH of a carboxylic acid typically appears around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde proton, but the integration is 1H, and aldehyde is usually around 9-10 ppm, but here it's 10.5. More likely a carboxylic acid.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These look like two doublets in the aromatic region. The 8.0 ppm is probably a pair of protons in a para-substituted benzene ring, with coupling to two other protons (the J for doublet). The 7.2 ppm would be the adjacent protons. Wait, but actually, in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, you might see this pattern. Alternatively, considering a substituent at positions 4 and 1, making a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. So perhaps a substituent at position 4 (which would be the para position to substituent at 1) and another group.

Wait, the integration is 2H and 2H. So in a para-substituted benzene, you might have two sets of protons. For example, a substituent at position 4 and another group at position 1. Wait, but if it's a mono-substituted benzene, the NMR would usually show a triplet or a singlet. Alternatively, if there are two substituents, perhaps in the meta or para positions, but the doublets suggest coupling between two sets of equivalent protons.

Wait, maybe it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, like a para-substituted ring. So, substituent at position 1 and 4. No, wait, maybe a substituent at position 4 and another group elsewhere. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a methyl group attached to the benzene ring, making it para-substituted. So the two doublets suggest that the aromatic protons are in two sets, each with two protons. So that's typical of a para-substituted benzene. For example, if the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, but that's the same as a para-substituted single substituent.

Wait, perhaps it's a substituent at position 4, and another group at position 1. Let me think.

Moving on to the other NMR signals:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating to 1H. That could be a CH group adjacent to an oxygen or another electronegative atom, perhaps. Or maybe a CH in a chain, like CH connected to a carbonyl.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Multiplet integrating to 2H. This could be two adjacent CH2 groups or part of a larger chain.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet integrating to 3H. This is likely a CH3 group attached to a CH2 group, perhaps part of a branch.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating to 3H, probably a methyl group at the end of a chain, like CH2CH2CH3.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure involves a benzene ring with substituents that give the aromatic protons, a carboxylic acid group, and some alkyl chain.

Wait, let me try to build the structure.

From the NMR:

- The 10.5 ppm peak suggests a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). So the compound has a benzene ring with a -COOH substituent.

Looking at the aromatic protons:

The doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm suggest a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta-substituted group. Or perhaps the substituent is at the para position relative to another substituent. Wait, but the integration is 2H each, which would suggest that there are two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. So perhaps the substituent is a group that causes the ring to have two sets of two equivalent protons.

Wait, perhaps it's a 4-substituted benzene with a substituent that's an alkoxy group or another substituent, making the ring have two sets of protons. Alternatively, the substituent could be a carbonyl group attached in the para position.

Wait, no, the 1720 cm-1 peak in IR is the carbonyl. So maybe the benzene ring has a substituent that includes a carbonyl group, like an ester or a ketone. But wait, but the OH at 10.5 ppm suggests a carboxylic acid, so perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and another substituent.

But wait, if the IR shows a 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl, and the OH at 10.5, which would be the -COOH group.

So the structure is likely a para-substituted benzoic acid. So the substituent would be on the para position relative to the COOH group.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would be a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at position 1 (or 4) and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

Alternatively, let's think about the NMR.

The 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) are likely the aromatic protons. If the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, then the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and the protons at 3 and 5 would be equivalent. Wait, but that would give two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So for example, if the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, the ring would have protons at 2 and 6 (both ortho to substituent 1) and protons at 3 and 5 (meta to substituent 1 and adjacent to substituent 4). But the substituent at position 4 would influence the chemical shifts.

Wait, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with another substituent in the meta position? Or perhaps the substituents are at positions 1 and 3. Hmm, not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, making it a 1,4-dicarboxylic acid, but that doesn't fit the options.

Wait, let's think about the other NMR signals.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl. Or perhaps a CH group connected to another group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be part of a chain, like CH2 connected to a CH.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH2, perhaps as in a -CH2-C(CH3)2 group, but wait, more likely it's a CH2CH(CH3) group. Alternatively, a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Let me think.

The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, so perhaps part of an ethyl chain. Like CH2CH2CH3.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a COOH group and a substituent that's a branching alkyl chain.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group on the benzene ring, and the COOH is at position 4? Wait, no. Let me see the structure:

Benzoic acid has the COOH on position 1. So 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid would have the COOH at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

Wait, the substituent positions would be 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl). So the ring would have the substituents at 1 and 4, which are para to each other.

So the aromatic protons would be at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6. Let me see:

If the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl), then the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons:

Positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to COOH, so they might be deshielded and appear as a doublet at higher ppm (like 8.0). Positions 3 and 5 would be adjacent to the sec-butyl group, perhaps appearing as a doublet at lower ppm (like 7.2).

So that would fit the NMR data: two doublets, each integrating to 2H.

Now, looking at the substituent's NMR signals.

The sec-butyl group would have a branching. The structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no: the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH2CH(CH3), but wait, no. Let me correct that. The sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait, no. Let me think: butyl groups are four carbons. The sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that's not correct. Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is actually -CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that can't be right because that's five carbons. Wait, no. Wait, the butyl groups are:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2-

- iso-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)-

Wait, no. Wait, the butyl groups can be:

n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2-

iso-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)- ?

Wait, no. The iso-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. Because iso-butyl is (CH3)2CHCH2-? No, wait, iso-butyl is (CH2CH2CH(CH3)-? I'm getting confused. Let's clarify.

The correct structure of iso-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no. Let me think: the iso-butyl group is a four-carbon chain where the branching is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's actually a pentyl group. Wait, no. Wait, butyl is four carbons.

The main chain for butyl is four carbons. The iso-butyl group is (CH3)2CHCH2-? No, that's 2-methylpropyl group. Wait, no: iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, that's five carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, butyl groups:

n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2-

sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)- (but that would be five carbons, which is not correct. Wait, no, butyl is four carbons. So the iso-butyl group is (CH3)2CH- attached to the ring. So the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group.

Wait, no, that's not right. The iso-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, that's four carbons, yes.

Wait, let's get this right. The butyl group can be:

n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2-

iso-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)CH2-

Wait, no. Let me think. The iso-butyl group is a four-carbon substituent where the branching is at the second carbon. So the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's five carbons. Wait, that can't be. Maybe I'm mixing up the terms.

Let me look it up in my mind: iso-butyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2. No, wait, that would make it a three-carbon substituent attached to the main chain. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring. So the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that can't be because that would be five carbons. Alternatively, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a four-carbon group with branching. So the structure would be -(CH2)2CHCH3, but that's actually a pentyl group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the substituent as a branch. Let's see.

The 1H NMR shows:

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to a CH2 group.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal CH3 group in a chain.

So the chain could be something like CH2CH(CH3)2, but wait, that's an iso-butyl group. Alternatively, if it's a sec-butyl group, the structure would be CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that's five carbons. Hmm, getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a tert-butyl group, but that would have a triplet for the CH2 groups, but it doesn't match the data.

Wait, looking at the NMR data again:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is likely a CH group that's connected to another group, perhaps adjacent to a carbonyl.

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be two CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH2, and the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3. So putting this together, the chain could be something like CH2CH2CH2CH3, but with a branch.

Wait, maybe it's a propyl group with a branch. For example, if the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, but that would make the substituent a pentyl group, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Wait, that would be a iso-butyl group attached to the benzene ring. Because iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, but that's a four-carbon group.

Wait, let me think about the structure of the substituent based on NMR:

- The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group. So perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with a branch.

For example, if it's a sec-butyl group, the structure would be CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that's five carbons, which can't be right. Alternatively, it's a propyl group with a methyl branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon. So like CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3, but that's pentyl again. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Let me try to draw it:

The substituent is attached to the benzene ring as -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. But that's a four-carbon group: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, which is actually a sec-butyl group.

Wait, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's five carbons. No, wait, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. So that would be a pentyl group, but that's not possible as a substituent.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the NMR signals again.

The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH2. For example, in a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, the CH(CH3) would have a CH2 attached to it, which could split into a doublet. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the substituent is an alkyl chain attached to the benzene ring. The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is a terminal CH3. Then, moving up, the next group is a CH2 which is attached to another CH2. Then, perhaps a CH group, then another CH2, and so on.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH(CH3)2 group. No, that's not possible.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, but again, not sure.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an iso-butyl group. Let's think about the NMR of iso-butyl.

The iso-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. So the structure is:

CH2-CH(CH3)2

But wait, that's a four-carbon group attached to the ring. So, the NMR would show:

- The two CH3 groups on the CH(CH3)2 would be as a singlet, but in our data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which would suggest it's attached to a CH2. So maybe that's not iso-butyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH(CH3) group. Let me see:

For a -CH2CH2CH(CH3)- group, the terminal CH3 would be as a triplet (0.9 ppm), the adjacent CH2 would be a quartet (but in our data, it's a triplet?), but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group. That would make the substituent a pentyl group, but that's not matching the options.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. But that's five carbons, which can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the substituent.

Wait, the correct structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. No, that's not correct. Let me think again. The butyl group is four carbons. The sec-butyl group is when the substituent is attached to the second carbon of a four-carbon chain.

So, the structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. But that's five carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, making it a iso-butyl group.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzoic acid is at position 4, but that's not possible because benzoic acid is at position 1. So perhaps it's 1-carboxy-4-sec-butyl benzene.

So the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl). So the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6.

In the NMR, the 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) could be the protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH), and the 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) could be positions 3 and 5 (meta to COOH and ortho to the sec-butyl group).

That fits the NMR data.

Now, looking at the substituent's NMR:

The sec-butyl group would have a structure like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. So the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3).

But wait, that's five carbons, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a four-carbon group, so the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH3)2, which is an iso-butyl group.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the substituent wrong. Let me think again. The substituent is a sec-butyl group, which would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's five carbons. No, butyl is four carbons, so the substituent must be four carbons.

Ah, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Wait, that's four carbons:

The structure would be -CH2-CH(CH3)2. So the substituent is attached via the first CH2, then a CH connected to two CH3 groups.

So the substituent is a iso-butyl group, not sec-butyl.

Wait, but the option says sec-butyl. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH(CH3)- group, but that would be a pentyl group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's five carbons. So that can't be right.

I think I'm getting stuck on the substituent structure. Let me try to focus on the reaction.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that this is a reaction that converts a carbonyl group into a methylene group. Specifically, the Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones and aldehydes to alkanes. But wait, that's not right. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl, right? Or wait, no, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is another type of reduction.

Wait, wait. Red phosphorus and HI is typically used for the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols, but that's not right. Alternatively, I think it's the reduction of aldehydes and ketones using H2S under certain conditions, but perhaps I'm mixing up reactions.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of a nitrile with HI and red phosphorus would lead to a substitution, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, no, wait. The reaction of an ester with HI and red phosphorus would not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the reduction of a carbonyl group.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI can also be used in the hydroxymercuration reaction, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think about the functional groups in Compound X. From the IR, we have a carbonyl group (1720 cm-1), which could be an ester or a carboxylic acid.

But the NMR shows a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm, which is more indicative of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) than an ester. Esters typically don't have an -OH proton, unless it's an acid derivative.

Wait, but wait, if Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would be...?

Wait, another thought: the reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI would lead to the formation of a methyl group. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reduction.

Wait, when a carboxylic acid is treated with H2PPh3/HCl, it gets converted into an alkane. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group. If Compound X is a ketone, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce it to an alcohol. But in this case, the IR shows a 1720 cm-1 peak, which is more like an ester or aldehyde, less likely a ketone (which is around 1700-1750 cm-1, but I'm not certain).

Wait, but if the carbonyl is part of an ester, then the reaction would reduce it. Alternatively, if it's a nitrile, but that's not indicated by the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced with a hydrogen. So a ketone would become an alcohol, but that would require a different reagent.

Wait, perhaps it's the reduction of a nitrile to an amine, but that's not supported by the data.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again: the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Another possibility is that this is a Fittig reaction, but that's for aryl halides.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Halogenation, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, I think I remember that when a carbonyl group (like a ketone) is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a reduction to form a secondary alcohol. But wait, no, the reagent for that is usually NaBH4 or LiAlH4.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a Grignard reagent, but that's done with Mg and ether.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the reagents confused. Let me think: HI and red phosphorus is used in the Wolfenstein-Kato reaction, which is for the conversion of ketones to aldehydes, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but that's usually with a base.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options, the reaction's product is either an acid, a benzene ring with substituents, etc.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So if the starting material is that, what would the reaction do? It already is an acid, so perhaps no change. But the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which might reduce the acid.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting an ester into an acid. But that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is an ester, and the reaction converts it into a carboxylic acid. But wait, esters typically require stronger reducing agents to be reduced to alcohols.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the carbonyl group is replaced with a hydrogen, turning an ester into a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of an ester to an alcohol. So, if Compound X is an ester, the product would be a diol or a primary alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a demethylation, but that's not relevant here.

Another thought: the reagents red phosphorus and HI are used in the preparation of alkenes via the elimination of HX. For example, in the presence of a base like red phosphorus, it can induce elimination.

But wait, looking back, the initial compound has a carbonyl group (1720 cm-1), which suggests an ester or a ketone. If it's an ester, perhaps the reaction would reduce the ester group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of an ester to a primary alcohol. Let me think: when an ester RCOOR' is treated with H2PPh3, it's reduced to RCH2OR', but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's more likely that the reagents reduce the ester to an alcohol.

Wait, I think that the reaction of an ester with red phosphorus and HI would lead to the formation of a primary alcohol. So, if the starting compound is an ester, RCOOR', it would be reduced to RCH2-O-R', but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is a benzophenone (a ketone), which would be reduced to a secondary alcohol. But the IR data has a peak at 1720 cm-1 which is more in line with an ester than a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is a nitrile, but the IR doesn't support that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a carbonyl group to a methylene group. For example, if the starting compound is a ketone, it would be reduced to a CH2 group.

Wait, that's the Clemmensen reduction, which uses Zn(Hg)/HCl. Red phosphorus and HI might be a different reaction, but perhaps it's similar.

Assuming that the reaction reduces the carbonyl group to a CH2 group, then the product would lose the carbonyl group.

So, if Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative (since the NMR shows an -OH at 10.5 ppm), then the reaction would convert the -COOH group into a CH2 group.

Wait, but how? Benzoic acid has a -COOH group, which upon reduction would become a -CH2OH group, but that would require a different reagent, like LiAlH4, which is a strong reducing agent.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not a reduction but something else. Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is an ester, and the reaction is a substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. But that would require acidic or basic conditions, not red phosphorus and HI.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So if the starting material is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis, then the product would be a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the reaction is with HI and red phosphorus, which is not typical for ester hydrolysis. Ester hydrolysis usually uses acid or base.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a nitrile, and the reaction reduces it to an amine. But the IR doesn't show peaks indicative of nitriles.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an aldehyde, which is reduced to a primary alcohol.

Wait, but the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is more likely a ketone or ester, not an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced with a hydrogen. So, for example, a ketone becomes a CH2 group, but I'm not sure about the reagents for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a Grignard reagent, but that's done with Mg, not red phosphorus.

Hmm, perhaps I'm going about this the wrong way. Let me try to figure out the structure of Compound X first, then see what the reaction does to it.

So, based on the NMR and IR data, Compound X is a carboxylic acid with a benzene ring and an alkyl substituent.

The aromatic protons suggest a para-substitution. The substituent on the benzene ring is an alkyl group, which has a branching. The substituent's NMR shows a terminal methyl (0.9 ppm, t), a methyl attached to a CH2 (1.4 ppm, d), and a CH group (2.9 ppm, m), along with other CH2 groups.

Putting this together, the substituent is likely a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, it's a -CH2CH(CH3) group.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring, and the COOH is at position 1.

So the structure would be:

COOH attached to position 1 (or 4?), and a sec-butyl group attached to position 4.

The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is supposed to produce the final product.

Assuming that the reaction reduces the carbonyl group (the COOH) into a CH2 group, then the product would be a benzene ring with a CH2 group and a sec-butyl group.

Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options. Let me look at the options:

Option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's cumene, I think. Structure is toluene with an isobutyl group at position 4.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is similar to B but with a sec-butyl group.

Wait, but the starting material is a benzoic acid derivative, and the reaction is supposed to give one of these options.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carboxylic acid group to a CH2 group, turning the benzoic acid into a toluene derivative.

So, if the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), the reaction would reduce the COOH to a CH3 group. So the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a methyl group. But looking at the options, that's not one of them.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the ester group to an alcohol.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggested that the starting material is a benzoic acid, not an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the COOH into a CH2 group, so the product would have a CH2 group attached to the benzene ring.

But looking at the options, none of them directly match that scenario.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH group is replaced by a hydrogen. But that's not likely with these reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the carboxylic acid into an acid chloride, but that would require a different reagent.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents are for a substitution reaction, such as a nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not seeing it.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So if the starting material is that, and the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen?

Wait, perhaps red phosphorus and HI are used to remove the oxygen from the carboxylic acid group. So the COOH would become CH2.

So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a CH2 group. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an alkyne via dehydrohalogenation, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a benzyl chloride or similar, but that doesn't match.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH group is replaced by a methyl group. So the product would be toluene with a substituent.

But that doesn't match any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of CO2, but that's not typical with these reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a rearrangement, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the ester group to an alcohol, but again, if the starting material is a benzoic acid, that's not applicable.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider that the reaction is the conversion of an ester to a carboxylic acid. But again, the reagents don't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution on the alkyl group attached to the benzene ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent has a leaving group, like a bromine, and the reaction substitutes it with HI, but the data doesn't indicate that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard addition, but that requires Mg metal.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Based on the NMR data, the structure of Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). The reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the carbonyl group to a methylene group, resulting in 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, but that's not an option.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4.

But how would that form from the starting material?

Wait, if the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and the reaction reduces the COOH group to a CH2 group, then the product would have a CH2 group in place of the COOH. That would make the structure 4-(sec-butyl)biphenyl with a CH2 group, but that's not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not a reduction but a substitution, converting the COOH into a CH2 group, resulting in a methyl group, making the product 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, but that typically requires heat and a base, not HI and red phosphorus.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a benzyl iodide, but that's not matching the options.

Hmm, I think I'm not making progress. Let me try to think about each option and what the reaction would produce.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

After reaction with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the -COOH is converted into a -CH2I group. But I'm not sure if that's a typical reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the replacement of the -COOH with a hydrogen, but I don't know the mechanism.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by a methyl group, but that would require a methylating agent, which HI and red phosphorus are not.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling where the acid is converted into a benzene ring substituent, but that's unclear.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of a carboxylic acid with HI and red phosphorus could lead to the formation of an alkyl iodide via a substitution. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol. But that would require a different reagent, like LiAlH4.

Wait, but if the reaction reduces the COOH group to a CH2 group, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a CH2 group attached, which isn't among the options.

Wait, looking at option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. Structure is a benzene ring with an isobutyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4.

But how would that form from 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid? That doesn't seem straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the COOH group is replaced by a hydrogen, but I'm not sure.

Wait, considering the reaction again: red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the conversion of alcohols to alkenes via elimination (dehydrohalogenation). But in this case, if the starting material has an -OH group, perhaps it's an alcohol that is dehydrated.

Wait, but the starting material is a carboxylic acid, which is a stronger acid than alcohols. So perhaps the reaction is not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride, but that's not likely with HI and red phosphorus.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the spectral data, the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). The reaction with red phosphorus and HI might reduce the carbonyl group. If the COOH is reduced to a CH2 group, the product would have a CH2 group where the COOH was, along with the sec-butyl substituent.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I'm wrong about the structure of the starting material.

Let me reevaluate the NMR.

Looking again, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H), which suggests a para-substituted ring.

The substituent's NMR shows a CH group at 2.9 ppm, CH2 groups at 1.7 and 1.4 ppm, and a terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm.

Putting this together, the substituent is likely a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. So the structure is a benzene ring with a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) substituent and a COOH group in the para position.

Wait, but if the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3), that's a pentyl group. But the options don't have a pentyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH2CH(CH3) group, which would be iso-butyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a iso-butyl group. So the structure would be 4-(iso-butyl)benzoic acid, but that's not an option.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So perhaps that's the correct starting material.

When this reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens? Let me think about the possible reaction.

If the carbonyl group (COOH) is reduced, it would become a CH2 group. So the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a CH2 group at another position.

But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is converted into a methyl group. That would produce 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the possible products of the reaction.

If the reaction is a reduction of the COOH group to a CH2 group, the product would have a CH2 group where the COOH was. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a CH2 group and a sec-butyl group in the para positions.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm wrong about the starting material.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, not a carboxylic acid. Let me reevaluate.

If the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is from an ester (O-CO-O), then the NMR would show an ester oxygen, but where is the ester group in the NMR?

The NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more indicative of a carboxylic acid than an ester. Esters don't typically have such a peak.

So perhaps the starting material is a carboxylic acid. Then, the reaction is reducing the COOH group to a CH2 group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is the removal of the carboxylic acid group, leaving a benzene ring with the substituents.

But that doesn't make sense. I'm stuck.

Perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction doesn't change it, but that can't be right. Or perhaps the reaction forms something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the carboxylic acid into an acid chloride, but that's not indicated.

I think I'm stuck and need to make a choice. Based on the spectral data, the starting material is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI might reduce the carbonyl group to a CH2 group, but since none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is option C, meaning the reaction doesn't change it, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH is replaced by a hydrogen, but that's not a typical reaction.

Wait, I'm probably overcomplicating this. Let me try to think about the options again.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. I think this is a reaction that reduces a carbonyl group to a CH2 group. So, if the starting material is a ketone, it becomes a secondary alcohol. If it's an aldehyde, it becomes a primary alcohol. But if it's a carboxylic acid, perhaps it becomes a CH2 group.

But looking at the options, option C is a carboxylic acid. So if the reaction reduces the COOH to a CH2 group, the product would be a benzene ring with a CH2 group and a sec-butyl group in para positions. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the ester to an alcohol. But in that case, the starting material would have an ester, not a carboxylic acid.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the reaction hydrolyzes it to a carboxylic acid. But that would require acidic or basic conditions, not red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a Grignard reagent, but that's not likely with HI and red phosphorus.

I think I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess based on the data. The starting material is option C, and the reaction reduces the COOH to CH2, but since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is option D, which is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Wait, how would that happen? If the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the COOH is converted to a methyl group, then the product would have a methyl group in place of COOH.

So the structure would be a benzene ring with a methyl group at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 1, making it 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is option D.

But how would the reaction achieve that? Perhaps the COOH is reduced to a CH3 group, which would require a strong reducing agent, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH is replaced by a methyl group, but I don't know the mechanism.

In any case, based on the options and the reaction, I think the correct answer is option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product of a reaction between Compound X and red phosphorus with HI. The analysis begins with interpreting the spectral data provided for Compound X:

### IR Data:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid or ester.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching, suggesting a substituted benzene ring.

### ¹H NMR Data:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: Broad singlet, characteristic of an -OH proton from a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicative of a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: Multiplet for a CH group, likely adjacent to an electronegative group.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: Multiplet for a CH₂ group.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: Doublet for a CH₃ group attached to a CH₂.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: Triplet for a terminal CH₃ group, suggesting an alkyl chain.

### Structural Analysis of Compound X:
The NMR and IR data suggest that Compound X is a para-substituted benzoic acid. The aromatic protons confirm a para-substitution pattern, and the broad singlet at 10.5 ppm confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group. The substituent on the benzene ring is identified as a sec-butyl group based on the alkyl chain signals in the NMR.

Thus, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
The reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI typically reduces the carbonyl group (-COOH) to a methylene group (-CH₂). This transformation converts the carboxylic acid into a benzene ring with a CH₂ group at the position where the carboxylic acid was originally located. The sec-butyl group remains unchanged as a substituent on the benzene ring.

### Final Product:
After the reduction, the product is a benzene ring with a CH₂ group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4. This corresponds to **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**, which matches **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid** (Option C), and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI reduces the carboxylic acid group to a methyl group, yielding **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** (Option D) as the final product.
