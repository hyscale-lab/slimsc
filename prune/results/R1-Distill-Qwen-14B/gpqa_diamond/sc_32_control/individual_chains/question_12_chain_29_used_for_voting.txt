Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into a mu(+) and a neutrino. Pi(+) is at rest, and we're given their rest masses. The options are A to D, each giving two KE values.

Hmm, right, so this is a particle physics problem involving conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. So in the products, the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to conserve momentum. That means the magnitudes of their momenta are the same.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they're neutral and have very tiny (but non-zero) masses. But wait, in the case of muon decay, the neutrino is a muon neutrino, which I think is considered to have negligible mass compared to the muon and pion. Oh wait, but in the decay Pi+ → mu+ + nu, the neutrino is the anti-neutrino? Or is it a neutrino? Wait, the question says "nu", which I think is a neutrino. But in any case, the mass of the neutrino is usually considered to be negligible, so maybe we can approximate it as massless. Or perhaps the problem gives any mass for the neutrino? No, the problem only gives the masses for Pi and muon. So I guess we have to proceed assuming the neutrino is massless.

Wait, but let me think. If the neutrino is considered massless, then its energy would be equal to its momentum times c, but since we're working in units where c is 1, it's E = |p|.

So the pion is at rest, so total initial energy is its rest mass energy: E_initial = m_pi c². But since it's at rest, and the other particles are moving, their energy will be the sum of their rest energies plus kinetic energies.

Wait, but in particle physics, when dealing with decay products, the total energy is conserved, and since the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the products must be zero.

So, let's denote the muon as m and the neutrino as n. Let me think about their energies.

The initial energy is m_pi c², which is 139.6 MeV. So the total energy of the products must equal this.

The muon has rest mass m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c². Its total energy is gamma m_mu c², which is equal to sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ).

The neutrino, if massless, has energy E_nu = |p_nu| c. And since the total momentum is zero, p_mu = - p_nu. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

So, let me write the equations.

Total energy: E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c².

E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 )

E_nu = p_nu c = p_mu c (since |p_nu|= |p_mu|, but direction is opposite, but energy is positive).

So E_mu + p_mu c = m_pi c².

Wait, substituting E_mu:

sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + p_mu c = m_pi c².

Let me set x = p_mu c. Then the equation becomes:

sqrt( x² + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + x = m_pi c².

Wait, but m_pi c² is 139.6 MeV, m_mu c² is 105.7 MeV. Let me write m_pi = 139.6, m_mu = 105.7.

So, sqrt( x² + (105.7)^2 ) + x = 139.6.

Hmm, solving for x.

Let me subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2 ) = 139.6 - x.

Now square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expand the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

So,

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

Subtract x² from both sides:

(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x.

Let me compute these squares.

105.7^2 ≈ 11172.49 (since 100^2=10000, 5.7^2=32.49, 2*100*5.7=1140 → 10000+1140+32.49=11172.49).

139.6^2 = (140-0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

So:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 x.

Let me compute 2*139.6 = 279.2.

So,

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x.

Rearrange:

279.2 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Compute 19488.16 minus 11172.49.

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

So,

x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let me compute that.

8315.67 ÷ 279.2 ≈ Let's see, 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8, because 279 *30 is 8370, so 29 is 8096.8. 8315.67 minus 8096.8 is 218.87. So 29 + (218.87/279.2) ≈ 29 + ~0.783 ≈ 29.783. So x ≈ 29.78 MeV c^{-1} * c → x is in MeV units? Wait, wait. Wait, x is p_mu c, so x has units of MeV. Because p_mu is in MeV/c, multiplied by c gives MeV.

Wait, no, units again: x = p_mu c. Since p_mu is in MeV/c, p_mu c is in MeV. So yes, x is in MeV.

So x ≈ 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but wait, that's p_mu c = 29.78 MeV. So p_mu = 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but then the neutrino's momentum is the same magnitude, but opposite direction. So the neutrino's momentum is p_nu = - p_mu, but since E_nu is |p_nu| c, which is 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but wait, let's check the numbers again. Because when I calculated x, I got approximately 29.78, but let's be precise.

Let me compute 8315.67 / 279.2 accurately.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Well, 279.2 * 29 = let's compute 279 *29. 200*29=5800, 79*29=2291, so 5800+2291=8091. So 279.2 *29 = approx 8096.8 as before.

8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

Now, 218.87 / 279.2 = approximately 0.783.

So x ≈ 29.783 MeV.

So p_mu c = 29.783 MeV.

Now, let's compute E_mu: sqrt( (x)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) = sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

29.783 squared is approx (30 - 0.217)^2 ≈ 900 - 2*30*0.217 + (0.217)^2 ≈ 900 - 13.02 + 0.047 ≈ 887.

Wait, 29.783^2 = let's calculate more accurately.

29.783 * 29.783.

Well, 30 *30=900. 29.783 is 0.217 less than 30.

(30 - 0.217)^2 = 30^2 - 2*30*0.217 + 0.217^2 = 900 - 13.02 + 0.047 ≈ 887.027.

And 105.7^2 is 11172.49 as before.

So, sqrt(887.027 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.517) ≈ approx sqrt(12059.517) → Let me compute that.

What's 110^2? 12100. So 109.8^2 = (110 -0.2)^2 = 12100 - 2*110*0.2 + 0.04 = 12100 -44 +0.04= 12056.04.

Hmm, 109.8^2=12056.04. The value we have is 12059.517, which is a bit larger. So 109.8^2=12056.04, 109.9^2 = (109.8+0.1)^2=109.8² + 2*109.8*0.1 +0.1²=12056.04 +21.96 +0.01=12078.01.

Wait, but 12059.517 is between 109.8² and 109.8+something.

Wait, 109.8² is 12056.04. The difference between 12059.517 and 12056.04 is 3.477.

Each 0.1 increase in the number adds approximately 2*(109.8)*0.1 +0.01 = 21.96 +0.01=21.97 per 0.1 increase? Wait, no, perhaps better to compute using linear approximation.

Let me let x = 109.8, and f(x)=x². We know f(x)=12056.04. We have f(x + delta) = 12059.517.

delta ≈ (12059.517 - 12056.04) / (2*109.8) ) → (3.477)/(219.6) ≈ 0.0158.

So x + delta ≈ 109.8 +0.0158 =109.8158.

So sqrt(12059.517) ≈ 109.816.

Wait, but wait, 109.816^2 is:

Well, 109.8^2 is 12056.04.

0.016^2 is 0.000256.

2*109.8 *0.016 = 3.5136.

So 109.816^2 = 12056.04 + 3.5136 + 0.000256 ≈ 12059.5538.

Hmm, but I have 12059.517, which is a bit less than that. So maybe delta is a bit less than 0.016.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just take it as approximately 109.816 MeV.

So E_mu ≈ 109.816 MeV.

Then E_nu = x =29.783 MeV.

So the total energy is 109.816 +29.783 = 139.599 MeV, which is close to 139.6 MeV, so that checks out.

Now, the kinetic energy of the muon is E_mu - m_mu c².

E_mu is 109.816 MeV, m_mu c² is 105.7 MeV. So KE_mu = 109.816 -105.7 = approx 4.116 MeV.

The neutrino's kinetic energy is E_nu, since its rest mass is negligible. So KE_nu = 29.783 MeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D has KE as 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches closely.

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's the choice.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate x: 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me do it precisely.

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.

8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

218.87 / 279.2 = approx 0.783.

So x=29.783 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt(29.783² +105.7²) = sqrt(887.027 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.517)= approx 109.816 MeV.

So KE_mu = 109.816 -105.7 = 4.116 MeV → approx 4.12 MeV.

KE_nu = 29.783 MeV → approx 29.8 MeV.

So the answer should be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

**Reaction:**  
\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]  
Here, the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, and its rest mass energy is given as \(m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\). The rest mass energy of the muon (\(\mu^+\)) is \(m_{\mu} c^2 = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). The neutrino (\(\nu\)) is assumed to be massless.

### Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation:**  
   The total energy of the products must equal the total energy of the pion:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
2. **Momentum Conservation:**  
   Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum of the products must be zero. Thus, the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal and opposite:  
   \[
   |p_{\mu}| = |p_{\nu}|.
   \]

### Energy of the Muon and Neutrino
- The total energy of the muon is:  
  \[
  E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(p_{\mu} c)^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2}.
  \]
- The energy of the neutrino is:  
  \[
  E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} c = p_{\mu} c.
  \]

### Solving for Momentum
Using the energy conservation equation:  
\[
\sqrt{(p_{\mu} c)^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2} + p_{\mu} c = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
Let \(x = p_{\mu} c\). Substituting \(m_{\mu} c^2 = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\), the equation becomes:  
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 105.7^2} + x = 139.6.
\]  
Subtract \(x\) from both sides:  
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 105.7^2} = 139.6 - x.
\]  
Square both sides:  
\[
x^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.
\]  
Expand and simplify:  
\[
x^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x + x^2.
\]  
Cancel \(x^2\) and rearrange:  
\[
279.2x = 19488.16 - 11172.49.
\]  
\[
279.2x = 8315.67.
\]  
Solve for \(x\):  
\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.783 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Energy of the Muon
The total energy of the muon is:  
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{x^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2}.
\]  
Substitute \(x = 29.783 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu} c^2 = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\):  
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{29.783^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]  
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{887.027 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.517} \approx 109.816 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Muon
The kinetic energy of the muon is:  
\[
KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} c^2 = 109.816 - 105.7 = 4.116 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Energy of the Neutrino
The energy of the neutrino is:  
\[
E_{\nu} = x = 29.783 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy:  
\[
KE_{\nu} = 29.783 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. This matches **Option D**.
