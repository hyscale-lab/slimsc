Okay, I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think this through.

So, the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the different complexes are given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, stability constants usually refer to the formation of complexes, right?

I remember that the stability constant (β) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex from its ions. For each complex, the higher the β, the more stable the complex is. So, for Co(SCN)_n complexes, each βn corresponds to the nth complex.

So, the possible complexes here are Co(SCN)_1, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, and Co(SCN)_4. Each has its own stability constant.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Dithiocyanato would be the complex with two SCN- ions, so that's Co(SCN)_2^2+.

Wait, but wait. I'm a little confused about the color. I think the blue one is Co(SCN)_2^2+ for the [Co(SCN)_2]^(n?) complex. Alternatively, maybe dithiocyanato is the Co(SCN)_2 complex, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me assume that the problem refers to the [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) complex as the blue one, so that's the one we're focusing on.

So the task is to find the mole fraction (or percentage) of [Co(SCN)_2]^+ (maybe, but I'm not sure about the charge here) in the solution. Or wait, the charge on the complexes: each SCN- contributes a -1. Co is +2. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2 -n) ?

Wait, let's think. Co^2+ + n SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_n]^{2 -n}? Wait, no. Because each SCN^- is -1, and Co is +2. So the overall charge is 2+ - n*(-1) → 2 - n*(1) → 2 - n? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the formula would be [Co(SCN)_n]^{2 - n}? Hmm, no. Wait, Co is +2, each SCN is -1, so total charge is 2 - (n × 1) = 2 - n. So for n=1, charge is +1; n=2, 0; n=3, -1; n=4, -2. Hmm, but I'm not sure if the charge affects the stability constants, but perhaps it's irrelevant for the calculation.

But the main point is to calculate the fraction of the [Co(SCN)_2] complex in the solution.

I remember that when multiple complexes can form, their concentrations depend on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions. The general approach is to set up the equilibrium expressions, but that can get complicated. Alternatively, the distribution of the complexes can be determined using the stability constants and the formula for the fraction of each complex.

Wait, I think there's a way to calculate the fraction of each complex based on the relative stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand and metal ions.

The formula for the fraction (f_n) of the nth complex is given by f_n = (β_n [L]^n) / (Σ (β_m [L]^m)) ), where the sum is from m=0 to m_max (which is 4 in this case). Wait, but wait. Do we include m=0, which would be the free Co^2+ ion? Because the sum includes all possible complexes, including the uncomplexed Co^2+.

Wait, no, because when m=0, the complex is just Co^2+ (since L is SCN-; m=0 implies no ligands). So β_0 is 1, I think, because it's the case where no complex is formed. So the total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all species: [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3]^− + [Co(SCN)_4]^2−.

Wait, but the stability constants given are β1, β2, β3, β4. So perhaps β0 is 1, as the base case.

So the formula for the fraction of each complex is:

f_n = (β_n [L]^n) / (β_0 [M]_0 + β_1 [L]^1 [M]_1 + β_2 [L]^2 [M]_2 + ... )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the formation of each complex step.

The general approach is to consider each complex as being formed stepwise. The fraction for each complex can be found using the formula involving the log of the stability constants and the ligand concentrations.

Alternatively, I think that the fraction of each complex can be calculated using the formula:

f_n = (β_n [L]^n) / Σ (β_m [L]^m) ), where m is from 0 to 4.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think again.

The total concentration of Co is the sum of all the species: [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^{2-}] = c_total = 1e-2 M.

But each of these species can be expressed in terms of the free Co^2+ concentration and the ligand concentration, using the stability constants.

Let me denote [Co^2+] as x.

Then:

[CoSCN^+] = β1 * x * [SCN^-]
[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 * x * [SCN^-]^2
[Co(SCN)_3^-] = β3 * x * [SCN^-]^3
[Co(SCN)_4^{2-}] = β4 * x * [SCN^-]^4

Wait, no. Because each subsequent complex is formed by adding another SCN- ligand. So the concentration of the nth complex is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = β_n * x * [SCN^-]^n

Wait, no, is that correct? Because β_n is the cumulative stability constant for the nth complex. So the concentration of the nth complex is β_n * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^n.

Wait, but β_n is the equilibrium constant for the reaction:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}

So the expression for [Co(SCN)_n] is β_n * [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

But in this case, the βs are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, wait a second. β1 would be for [Co(SCN)]^+, which is the first complex. So the formation equation is Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)]^+. The β1 is 9.

Similarly, β2 is for the second complex, which is the [Co(SCN)_2] complex (like [Co(SCN)_2]^0?), and β2 is 40. So each β_n is for the nth complex.

So the concentrations of each complex are as follows:

[CoSCN^+] = β1 * x * [SCN^-]^1
[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 * x * [SCN^-]^2
[Co(SCN)_3^-] = β3 * x * [SCN^-]^3
[Co(SCN)_4^{2-}] = β4 * x * [SCN^-]^4

And the free [Co^2+] is x.

So the total cobalt concentration is:

x + β1 x [SCN^-] + β2 x [SCN^-]^2 + β3 x [SCN^-]^3 + β4 x [SCN^-]^4 = c_total = 1e-2 M.

We can factor x out:

x [1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [SCN^-]^4 ] = c_total.

We can compute the term in the brackets. Let's compute each term:

Given that [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

Compute each term:

1. 1 (the term for m=0)
2. β1 [SCN^-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9
3. β2 [SCN^-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4
4. β3 [SCN^-]^3 =63 * (0.1)^3 =63 * 0.001=0.063
5. β4 [SCN^-]^4 =16 * (0.1)^4 =16 *0.0001= 0.0016

Add all these terms:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9
1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3
2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363
2.363 + 0.0016 ≈ 2.3646

So the denominator is approximately 2.3646.

So x = c_total / 2.3646 ≈ (1e-2) / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004225 M.

Wait, is that correct? Because x is [Co^2+].

Now, the concentration of each complex is:

[CoSCN^+] = β1 x [SCN^-] =9 * 0.004225 *0.1= 9*0.0004225=0.0038025 M

[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 x [SCN^-]^2 =40 * 0.004225 * (0.1)^2=40 * 0.004225 *0.01=40 *0.00004225=0.00169 M

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = β3 x [SCN^-]^3=63 * 0.004225 * (0.1)^3=63 *0.004225 *0.001=63 * 4.225e-6 ≈ 2.662e-5 M.

[Co(SCN)_4^{2-}] = β4 x [SCN^-]^4=16 *0.004225*(0.1)^4=16*0.004225*0.0001=16 *4.225e-8=6.76e-7 M.

So all the species:

[Co^2+] ≈ 0.004225 M
[CoSCN^+] ≈ 0.0038025 M
[Co(SCN)_2] ≈ 0.00169 M
[Co(SCN)_3^-] ≈ 2.662e-5 M
[Co(SCN)_4^{2-}] ≈ 6.76e-7 M

Now, the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is [Co(SCN)_2], which we found to be approximately 0.00169 M.

The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, which is 0.01 M.

So the fraction is (0.00169) / 0.01 = 0.169. So 16.9%.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. Hmm, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of x. Let me re-do that part.

We have x [1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016] = 1e-2.

So 1 + 0.9 is 1.9, plus 0.4 is 2.3, plus 0.063 is 2.363, plus 0.0016 is 2.3646.

So x = (1e-2) / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004225 M.

Wait, but when I calculated [Co(SCN)_2], I did 40 * 0.004225 * (0.1)^2.

Wait, (0.1)^2 is 0.01. 40 *0.004225=0.169. 0.169 *0.01=0.00169 M.

So that's correct.

So the concentration is 0.00169 M. The total is 0.01 M. So percentage is (0.00169 / 0.01) *100 = 16.9%.

So option D is 16.9%, which is the answer. But wait, the options are labeled A to D. Let me check: A is 42.3%, B 25.6%, C 38.1%, D 16.9%.

But wait, that can't be right, because I remember that the complex with the highest β may not necessarily be the most abundant because the concentration of ligand affects that.

Wait, the β for [Co(SCN)_3] is 63, which is higher than β2=40. So why is the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2] so low?

Ah, because even though β3 is higher, the ligand concentration is 0.1 M. So for [Co(SCN)_3], you're raising [SCN^-] to the third power. Let's think about the terms in the denominator.

The denominator was 2.3646, of which the largest term was 0.9 (from β1 [SCN^-] ) and β2 [SCN^-]^2 was 0.4. So the sum is dominated by the lower-order terms because [SCN^-] is 0.1, which is relatively low.

Wait, wait. Let me re-calculate the denominator terms more accurately.

1 + (9 *0.1) + (40*(0.1)^2) + (63*(0.1)^3) + (16*(0.1)^4).

Calculating each term:

1) 1 = 1.

2) 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

3) 40 * 0.01 = 0.4.

4) 63 * 0.001 = 0.063.

5) 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016.

Sum all terms: 1 + 0.9 = 1.9; 1.9 +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

So x = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004225 M.

So [Co(SCN)_2] is β2 x [SCN^-]^2 =40 * 0.004225 * 0.01 =40 * 0.00004225=0.00169 M.

So 0.00169 /0.01= 16.9% is correct.

But wait, the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the third complex has a higher β than the second.

But why is [Co(SCN)_3] so low in concentration? Because each higher n requires more SCN-.

Wait, let me compute [Co(SCN)_3^-]:

β3=63, so [Co(SCN)_3] = 63 * x * (0.1)^3.

x is 0.004225.

So 63 * 0.004225 = 0.2662.

Multiply by (0.1)^3=0.001: 0.2662 * 0.001 = 0.0002662 M.

So [Co(SCN)_3^-] is 0.0002662 M. Which is 0.02662% of the total.

So the third complex is much less than the second.

Wait, why is [Co(SCN)_2] higher than [Co(SCN)_3]?

Because the denominator has higher terms as n increases. Let me think about the terms in the denominator for each complex.

The fraction for each complex is (β_n [SCN^-]^n) divided by the sum.

So [Co(SCN)_2] fraction is (40 * (0.1)^2 ) / (2.3646) = (40 * 0.01) / 2.3646 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169 or 16.9%.

Wait, but the third term is 63 * (0.1)^3 = 0.063. 0.063 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.0266 or 2.66%.

So [Co(SCN)_3] is about 2.66% of the total, which is less than [Co(SCN)_2].

Hmm. So the most abundant species would be [CoSCN^+], because β1 [SCN^-] is 0.9, which is the largest individual term in the denominator sum.

Wait, but in the denominator, 0.9 is the second term, and the first term is 1. So the largest term is the first complex (n=1), followed by the second.

Wait, let me compute the fractions for each complex:

For n=0: term is 1. So fraction is (1) / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4225 or 42.25%.

n=1: 0.9 /2.3646 ≈ 0.3804 → 38.04%.

n=2: 0.4 /2.3646≈0.169 →16.9%.

n=3: 0.063 /2.3646≈0.0266 →2.66%.

n=4:0.0016 /2.3646≈0.000676 →0.0676%.

So the breakdown is roughly:

42.25% free Co^2+,

38% [CoSCN^+],

16.9% [Co(SCN)_2],

2.66% [Co(SCN)_3^-],

0.0676% [Co(SCN)_4^{2-}].

So the [Co(SCN)_2] is about 16.9%, which is option D.

But I'm a bit confused because the β3 is higher than β2, but the fraction of [Co(SCN)_3] is lower. Because the denominator's terms are sum of βn [SCN]^n, and [SCN] is low (0.1 M). So the higher β for n=3 is offset by the higher power of [SCN^-] (0.1)^3=0.001, making the term 63 * 0.001=0.063, which is less than the term for n=2, which is 40 * 0.01=0.4.

So the conclusion is that the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is 16.9%, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2], among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants and the given concentrations. The stability constants for the complexes are β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, and β4 = 16, and the ligand concentration is [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M.

The total cobalt concentration is distributed among all species: [Co^2+], [CoSCN^+], [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3^-], and [Co(SCN)_4^{2-}]. The concentrations of the complexes are proportional to the terms β_n [SCN^-]^n, where β_n is the stability constant for the nth complex. The total concentration is expressed as:

\[
c_{\text{total}} = x \left( 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 \right),
\]

where \( x = [\text{Co}^{2+}] \). Substituting the values:

\[
1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] = 1 + 9 \cdot 0.1 = 1.9,
\]
\[
\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4,
\]
\[
\beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063,
\]
\[
\beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016.
\]

Adding these terms:

\[
1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.
\]

Thus, the free cobalt concentration is:

\[
x = \frac{c_{\text{total}}}{2.3646} = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 0.004225 \, \text{M}.
\]

The concentration of [Co(SCN)_2] is given by:

\[
[\text{Co(SCN)_2}] = \beta_2 x [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot 0.004225 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.00169 \, \text{M}.
\]

The percentage of [Co(SCN)_2] among all cobalt species is:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)_2}]}{c_{\text{total}}} \right) \cdot 100 = \left( \frac{0.00169}{0.01} \right) \cdot 100 = 16.9\%.
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is **16.9%**, corresponding to option D.

Answer: D
