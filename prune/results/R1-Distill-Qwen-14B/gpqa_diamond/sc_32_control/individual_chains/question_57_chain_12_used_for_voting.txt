Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem gives me some phase shifts: δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, and δ4=13°. Wait, and it says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond these. I'm supposed to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are given in fm, which I remember stands for femtometers, 1e-15 meters, but I'm not sure if that's relevant right now.

Hmm. I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to the phase shifts δ_l. The formula I think is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * sum over l [ (2l+1) * (sin δ_l - δ_l) * e^{i l φ} ] or something like that. Wait, no, more accurately, the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts is given by:

f(θ) = (1/k) * ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] P_l(cosθ)

Where P_l is the Legendre polynomial. And since the question is about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, which I think is θ=0°, right? Because along the incident direction would be when the scattering angle is zero. So θ=0°, which means cosθ=1.

Wait, but what's the value of P_l(1)? Because the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is something I should figure out. I remember that P_0(x) is 1, P_1(x) is x, so P_1(1) is 1. P_2(x) is (3x² -1)/2, so P_2(1) is (3-1)/2=1. Wait no, wait: Let me think again. Wait, P_0=1. P_1=x. P_2=(3x²-1)/2. So when x=1, P_0=1, P1=1, P2=(3(1)^2 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1. Hmm, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait, for l=0, P0=1. l=1: P1(x)=x. So P1(1)=1. l=2: P2(x)= (3x² -1)/2, so P2(1)= (3*1 -1)/2= (2)/2=1. Oh! So for all l, P_l(1)=1? That's interesting. So when theta=0, the sum becomes (1/k) * sum (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] * 1.

Wait, but wait, that can't be correct because for l=0, P0(1)=1, l=1, P1(1)=1, etc. So the amplitude f(0) would be (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1 ].

But wait, the question isn't asking for the entire amplitude, just the imaginary part. So I can focus on the imaginary component of f(0).

So let me write f(0) as (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ].

Expanding e^{2iδ_l} as cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l), so [e^{2iδ_l} -1] = cos(2δ_l) -1 + i sin(2δ_l).

So the imaginary part of this is (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l).

So the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) multiplied by the sum over l of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

Wait, but what is k in this context? k is the wave number. I think in electron scattering, k is related to the momentum of the electron. The problem states that the electrons are 50 MeV. So I need to calculate k in terms of the electron's energy.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit hazy on the details. So the wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ, where m is the mass of the electron, E is the energy, and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, wait, that's in units where E is in terms of kinetic energy, right? Or is it in terms of total energy? Hmm, I think for non-relativistic cases, E = (ħ²k²)/(2m), but here 50 MeV is a relativistic energy, so perhaps I should use relativistic expressions. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the relation E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ), but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, but wait, in scattering experiments, especially in electron scattering, the wave number k is often written as k = (sqrt(2mE))/ħ. Wait, but when E is given in MeV, I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, I've heard that for electrons at high energies, the Compton wavelength is given by λ = 2πħ/(m c), but perhaps I can find k from the energy.

Alternatively, the Compton wavelength for the electron is about 2.426e-12 meters (since m_e c^2 is about 0.511 MeV, so λ = 2πħ/(m_e c) ≈ 2.426e-12 m). But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this step by step. Let me first calculate k.

Given E = 50 MeV. But what's the relation between E and k?

In relativistic terms, the energy E of an electron is given by E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ), where p is the momentum. The wave number k is p/(ħ). So, if I can express p in terms of E, I can get k.

So, E = gamma m c^2. For high energies, gamma is large, but I'm not sure if that approximation is needed.

Alternatively, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So, (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2. So, p = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 c^4 )/(c). Then, k = p/(ħ) = [ sqrt( E^2 - m^2 c^4 )/(c) ] / ħ.

But E is given in MeV, and m c^2 is about 0.511 MeV. So E is much larger than m c^2, so sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4) ≈ E (1 - (m^2 c^4)/(2 E^2)), but maybe for the purpose of calculation, we can approximate it as E.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

First, let's compute E = 50 MeV. m c^2 is 0.511 MeV. So, E is much larger than m c^2. So sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) ≈ E - (m c^2)^2/(2 E) ).

But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we can approximate (E^2 - (m c^2)^2) ≈ E^2, so p ≈ E/(c), and k ≈ E/(ħ c).

Wait, but let me compute the exact value.

Let me write E in units where m c^2 is in the same units. Let's compute E in eV: 50 MeV = 50e6 eV. m c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV.

So, E = 50e6 eV, m c^2 = 511,000 eV.

E squared is (50e6)^2 = 2.5e15 (eV)^2.

m c^2 squared is (5.11e5)^2 ≈ 2.61e11 (eV)^2.

So, E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ≈ 2.5e15 - 2.61e11 ≈ 2.5e15 (since 2.61e11 is negligible compared to 2.5e15). So, sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4) ≈ E.

So, p ≈ E/(c) * (1/ħ) ?

Wait, but I think I'm getting confused with units here. Let me approach this systematically.

The momentum p is given by p = sqrt( E^2/(c^2) - m^2 c^0 ), but perhaps I should look for the relation in terms of ħ.

Wait, ħ has units of J s. Let me think in terms of natural units where ħ c is a convenient unit.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute k in terms of inverse femtometers, because the options are in fm (1 fm = 1e-15 meters). So the units would be 1/fm = 1e15 m^{-1}.

Wait, but let me get k in terms of 1/fm. Let's compute k.

Given E is 50 MeV, which is 50e6 eV.

We can use the relation:

k = sqrt( (2 m E) ) / ħ

Wait, no, that's for non-relativistic, but in this case, E is much larger than m c^2, so relativistic effects are significant.

Alternatively, the relativistic expression for k is:

k = ( sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) ) / ( ħ c )

So, let's compute that.

E = 50 MeV = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J. Wait, but maybe better to work in units where ħ c is known.

Wait, ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm. Because 1 fm = 1e-15 m, and ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

Ah, that's probably a key relationship I should remember. So, for an electron, ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, the formula for k is k = [ sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) ] / ( ħ c )

But since E is much larger than m c^2, we can approximate sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2) ≈ E. So,

k ≈ E/(ħ c) = (50 MeV) / (197.33 MeV fm^{-1}) ) = 50 / 197.33 fm^{-1}.

Compute that: 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Wait, so k ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Wait, but wait, wait, the units: since ħ c is in MeV·fm, E is in MeV, so when you divide E by ħ c, you get (MeV) / (MeV·fm^{-1}) ) → (MeV * fm) / MeV ) → fm. Wait, no, wait:

Wait, let me think again. The denominator is (ħ c), which is in units of MeV·fm. Because ħ has units of J·s, c is m/s, so ħ c is J·m. But 1 J = 6.242e12 MeV, so ħ c in units of MeV·fm is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, E is 50 MeV. So when you divide E by (ħ c), the units would be (MeV) / (MeV·fm^{-1}) ) = (MeV * fm) / MeV ) = fm. So k is in 1/fm.

Wait, but in terms of units, k is [1/m], but when you express it in terms of fm, 1 fm is 1e-15 m, so 1/m is 1e15 fm^{-1}.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled in unit conversions. Let me think numerically.

k = E / (ħ c) → E is 50 MeV, ħ c is 197.33 MeV·fm. So,

k = 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So, 1/k = 1 / 0.253 ≈ 3.95 fm.

Wait, but wait, because in the expression for f(0), the imaginary part is (1/k) multiplied by the sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) for each l.

Wait, so first, I compute the sum for the given l values.

The given phase shifts are δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, δ4=13°. And I'm to ignore the rest beyond l=4, so sum from l=0 to l=4.

So for each l, compute (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l).

Let me compute each term step by step.

l=0: δ0=90°, 2δ0=180°. sin(180°)=0. So (2*0+1)*0 = 0.

l=1: δ1=67°, 2*67=134°. sin(134°)≈ sin(180-46)=sin(46)≈ 0.7193. So (2*1+1)=3. So 3 * 0.7193 ≈ 2.1579.

l=2: δ2=55°, 2δ2=110°. sin(110)=sin(70)≈0.9397. (2*2+1)=5. 5 * 0.9397 ≈4.6985.

l=3: δ3=30°, 2δ3=60°. sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660. (2*3+1)=7. 7 * 0.8660 ≈6.062.

l=4: δ4=13°, 2δ4=26°. sin(26)≈0.4384. (2*4+1)=9. 9 * 0.4384≈3.9456.

Now, sum all these contributions:

l=0: 0

l=1: ~2.1579

l=2: ~4.6985 → sum so far 6.8564

l=3: ~6.062 → sum 12.9184

l=4: ~3.9456 → sum 16.864.

So the total sum is approximately 16.864.

Now, multiply by (1/k) which is approximately 3.95 fm.

So, imaginary part of f(0) ≈ 16.864 * 3.95 fm.

Let me compute that: 16.864 * 3.95.

Approximating,

16 * 3.95 = 63.2

0.864 *3.95 ≈ 3.4016

So total approx 63.2 + 3.4016 = 66.6016 fm.

Wait, but none of the options match this. The options are A) 87163.4 fm, B)355.351 fm, C)177.675 fm, D)251.271 fm.

Wait, wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation of k?

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of k.

I have E=50 MeV, ħ c=197.33 MeV·fm.

k = E/(ħ c) = 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Wait, 1/k is 1 / 0.253 ≈ 3.952 fm.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake because in the formula, the imaginary part is (1/k) multiplied by the sum.

Wait, but 16.864 * 3.952 ≈ 66.67 fm. But none of the options are near that. So perhaps I messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me re-examine the formula for the scattering amplitude.

The correct formula is f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) [ (sin δ_l)/ (e^{i l φ}) ] * e^{2 i δ_l} ? Wait, no, perhaps I should look up the exact expression.

Wait, I think the correct expression is f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) (e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) P_l (cosθ).

So, the imaginary part of f(θ) is (1/k) sum (2l+1) Im[ e^{2i δ_l} - 1 ].

Which is (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ sin(2 δ_l) ].

So, that part is correct.

But perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the sum. Let me recompute each term accurately.

Compute each term:

l=0: (2*0+1)* sin(2*90°) → 1 * sin(180°) = 1 *0=0.

l=1: 3 * sin(134°). Let's compute sin(134 degrees).

134° is in the second quadrant, so sin is positive. 180-134=46°, so sin(46°)≈ 0.71934.

So 3 * 0.71934 ≈ 2.158.

l=2: (2*2+1)=5. 2δ=110°, sin(110)= sin(70)=approx 0.9396926.

5*0.9396926≈4.698463.

l=3: (2*3+1)=7. 2δ=60°, sin(60)=√3/2 ≈0.8660254.

7 * 0.8660254 ≈6.062178.

l=4: (2*4+1)=9. 2δ=26°, sin(26)=approx 0.438371.

9 * 0.438371≈3.945339.

Now, summing all these:

0 + 2.158 + 4.698463 +6.062178 +3.945339.

Adding step by step:

2.158 +4.698463=6.856463.

6.856463 +6.062178=12.918641.

12.918641 +3.945339=16.86398.

So the sum is approximately 16.864.

Multiply by 1/k, which is approx 3.952 fm.

So 16.864 *3.952 ≈ let's compute that accurately.

16 *3.952=63.232.

0.864 *3.952: let's compute 0.8 *3.952=3.1616; 0.064*3.952=0.251328.

Adding: 3.1616 +0.251328=3.412928.

Total: 63.232 +3.412928=66.644928 fm.

So approximately 66.64 fm.

But none of the options match this. The options are much larger. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of k. Let me recheck.

k = E/(ħ c) = 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm^{-1}) = 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k is approx 3.95 fm.

But wait, perhaps the formula for k is different. Maybe I should use the relativistic expression correctly.

Wait, the correct formula for k is k = sqrt( (2mE) ) / ħ, but that's for non-relativistic. But when E is much larger than m c^2, perhaps I should use the relativistic expression.

Wait, another approach: the relation between the Compton wavelength and k.

Wait, the Compton wavelength λ_c = h/(m c), where h is Planck's constant. But ħ = h/(2π), so λ_c = 2π ħ/(m c) ≈ 2.426e-12 m.

But in this case, E is 50 MeV, which is much larger than m c^2 (0.511 MeV). So the wavelength λ is approximately given by E = h c / λ → λ = h c / E.

Wait, but λ is the de Broglie wavelength. Then, k = 2π/λ = (2π E )/(h c).

But h = 2π ħ, so k = (2π E )/( 2π ħ c ) ) = E/( ħ c ), which is what I did before. So that should be correct.

Wait, so k is 50 MeV / 197.33 MeV fm^{-1} = 0.253 fm^{-1}. So 1/k is about 3.95 fm.

But the result I get is around 66.64 fm, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the sum.

Wait, perhaps I forgot some terms. Let me recount the phase shifts. The problem says δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, δ4=13°. So l runs from 0 to 4. So I considered all five terms correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have included all the phase shifts beyond l=4, but the problem says to ignore the rest, so I think I did that.

Wait, perhaps the sum is not just up to l=4, but perhaps higher l's? But the problem says to ignore the rest beyond these, so I think I did it right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum. Let me recheck each term.

l=0: 1 * sin(180) =0.

l=1: 3 * sin(134)=3 *0.71934≈2.158.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 *0.93969=4.69845.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7 *0.8660254≈6.062178.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9 *0.43837≈3.94533.

Sum: 2.158+4.69845=6.85645, +6.062178=12.918628, +3.94533=16.863958.

Wait, that's the same as before. So the sum is correct.

Hmm, the problem must be in the calculation of k. Let me think again.

Wait, did I use the correct formula for k? I think I might have used the wrong relation.

Wait, for an electron with energy E, the relativistic relation is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So, p = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c.

Then, k = p / ħ.

Wait, so let's compute p.

E =50 MeV = 50e6 * 1.602e-13 J (since 1 eV=1.602e-19 J, so 1 MeV=1e6 eV=1.602e-13 J).

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute E in units of MeV, m c^2 in MeV, and use the units accordingly.

E =50 MeV.

m c^2 =0.511 MeV.

So, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2.

So, pc = sqrt(50^2 - (0.511)^2 ) MeV ≈ sqrt(2500 - 0.261) ≈ sqrt(2499.739) ≈ 49.99739 MeV.

So, p = (49.99739 MeV ) / c.

Then, k = p / ħ.

But, p = (49.99739 MeV )/ c.

Expressed in terms of ħ c, which is 197.33 MeV fm.

So, k = [ (49.99739 MeV ) / c ] / ħ → (49.99739 MeV )/( ħ c ) → 49.99739 / 197.33 ≈ 0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So, 1/k ≈3.95 fm. So same as before.

Hmm. So if the sum is 16.864 and 1/k is 3.95, then 16.864 *3.95 ≈66.65 fm.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the integral of the imaginary part, but I think not. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is different.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is (k/(4π)) times the sum, because I think sometimes scattering theory uses different conventions.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about this.

The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ).

Wait, no, that can't be right because I thought the formula was (1/k) sum (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1] P_l.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula.

Upon checking (from memory), the correct formula is:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ).

Yes, so that part was correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation by forgetting to multiply by another factor.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the imaginary part of f(0) as (1/k) times the sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

Which I did, and got 16.864 *3.95 ≈66.64 fm.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, another thought: The measured phase shifts are given in degrees, but perhaps I should convert them to radians when computing the sine.

Wait, that's a possibility. Because in the formula, sin(2δ_l) is in radians.

Wait, let's see.

If I computed sin(2δ_l) in degrees, that's incorrect; I should compute it in radians.

So, perhaps this is where I went wrong.

So, let's recompute each term, converting degrees to radians.

Compute each sin(2δ_l) in radians.

l=0: δ0=90°, 2δ0=180° → π radians. sin(π)=0. So term is 0.

l=1: δ1=67°, 2δ1=134°.

134 degrees in radians is 134 * π/180 ≈ 2.340 radians.

sin(2.340) ≈ sin(134°) as before, which is 0.71934.

Wait, but wait, same as before. So perhaps that's not the mistake.

Wait, same for all l's. So the mistake isn't here.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts provided are in radians, but the question states degrees. But the question gives them as 90°, 67°, etc., so that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should have multiplied by 1/k correctly. Because in the formula, it's (1/k) multiplied by the sum.

Wait, if k is in fm^{-1}, 1/k is in fm. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should include the factor of 1/(2k) or something else. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = (1/(2k)) sum... Hmm, no, I think that's not correct because I've read that the formula is f(θ) = (1/k) sum... So perhaps that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the imaginary part of f in units of (fm), but perhaps the actual calculation uses a different value for k.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should have summed for all l, but the given phase shifts are up to δ4, and perhaps the higher l's contribute more.

But the problem says to ignore the rest beyond δ4, so I think I did that correctly.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the factor (2l+1) is multiplied by sin(2δ_l) directly, but perhaps I should have considered the summation as up to l=4, but the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 50/197.33.

Wait, 197.33 is approximately 200, so 50/200=0.25. So 0.253 is accurate.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

50 ÷ 197.33.

Let's compute:

197.33 × 0.25 = 49.3325.

Which is less than 50.

So 0.25 × 197.33 =49.3325.

The difference is 50 -49.3325=0.6675.

0.6675 /197.33 ≈ 0.00338.

So 0.25 +0.00338=0.25338.

So 50/197.33≈0.25338.

So 1/k ≈3.947 fm.

So, 16.864 ×3.947 ≈ let's compute this.

16 ×3.947=63.152.

0.864 ×3.947 ≈ 3.406.

Total ≈66.558 fm.

Still not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for f(θ). Another thought: perhaps the formula uses the sum of (2l+1) [e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] * (sinθ)^l * ... Wait, no, that's not correct because at θ=0, sinθ=0, but for higher terms, that would complicate things. But no, the correct formula at θ=0 uses P_l(1)=1, so the formula I used is correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the imaginary part is f(θ) multiplied by 2i, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the formula for scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2k)) sum ...? Then the result would be half of what I calculated.

If that's the case, then 66.64 fm /2 ≈33.32 fm, which is still not among the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is f(θ) = sum (2l +1) [ (e^{2i δ_l} -1) * (4π/(k)) * ... ]? No, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = (1/k) sum (2l +1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] * (4π/(2l+1)) )? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1/(2k) or another factor.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = 4π/k sum ... ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options given.

The options are A) 87163.4 fm, B)355.351 fm, C)177.675 fm, D)251.271 fm.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to multiply by a factor of 2 because the formula for the scattering amplitude is (1/k) times the sum, and then perhaps the imaginary part is f(θ) multiplied by some other factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is f(θ) = (1/(2k)) sum ... So the sum would be 16.864, multiplied by 1/(2k) → 16.864/(2*0.25338) ≈16.864/(0.50676)≈33.3 fm.

But that still doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula is f(θ) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ) → but I think I did that correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have multiplied by another factor, such as the reduced mass or something else. But in electron scattering from a nuclear target, the nucleus is much heavier than the electron, so the reduced mass μ ≈ m_e. So that shouldn't be a factor.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula uses the nuclear charge number Z in a Coulomb correction, but the problem states it's an elastic scattering, and perhaps it's assuming a hard-sphere model or something else where the Coulomb effects are ignored. But the problem didn't specify, so I think I shouldn't include any Coulomb terms.

Hmm. I'm stuck because my calculation doesn't match any options. So perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the question is not about the scattering amplitude, but about the differential cross-section. But the question specifically asks about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the integral of the imaginary part over all solid angles, but that's not what the question is asking.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the optical theorem, which relates the total cross-section to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude.

But the question is about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, which is θ=0, so the forward direction.

The optical theorem states that the total cross-section σ_total = (4π/k²) Im f(0).

But wait, the question isn't asking for the total cross-section; it's asking for Im f(0), which is (k²/(4π)) σ_total.

But I don't have the total cross-section given, so that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for something else. Let me read the question again.

The question says: "Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction."

So, it's definitely Im f(0), which I think I computed correctly as approximately 66.64 fm.

But the options are much larger, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that k is in reciprocal femtometers, and 1/fm is 1e15 m^{-1}, but perhaps I should have worked in a different unit system.

Wait, let me compute k in terms of 1/m instead of 1/fm.

k = 0.253 fm^{-1} = 0.253 * 1e15 m^{-1} = 2.53e14 m^{-1}.

But then, 1/k = (1/(2.53e14 m^{-1})) ) = 3.95e-15 m.

But 3.95e-15 m is 3.95 femtometers, which matches the earlier calculation of 3.95 fm.

So that part is correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a mistake in the sum calculation.

Wait, what if I miscalculated the sum.

Let me write down each term again:

l=0: 0.

l=1:3 * sin(134°) →3 * 0.71934=2.158.

l=2:5 * sin(110°) →5 * 0.93969=4.69845.

l=3:7 * sin(60°)=7 * 0.8660254=6.062178.

l=4:9 * sin(26°)=9 *0.438371=3.945339.

Sum:0 +2.158=2.158 +4.69845=6.85645 +6.062178=12.918628 +3.945339=16.863967.

Yes, same as before.

So the sum is about 16.864.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula requires the sum to be multiplied by another factor, such as 2, because the formula might have (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1 ].

Wait, let's think again about the formula.

The formula for the imaginary part is Im f(θ)= (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) P_l(cosθ).

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so it's (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

Which is correct.

So, perhaps I should compute the sum again, perhaps I made a mistake in the term for l=3.

Wait, wait, l=3: (2*3+1)=7. 2δ3=60°, sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660254.

So 7 * 0.8660254=6.0621778.

Yes, correct.

Hmm.

Perhaps the problem is not about the scattering amplitude, but about some other quantity. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses (2l+1) [e^{i(2δ_l)} -1 ] and thus the imaginary part would be (2l+1) [ sin(2δ_l) ].

Which is what I did.

Wait, perhaps I should sum over all l, including higher terms beyond l=4, but the problem says to ignore them.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are for the total cross-section, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the problem expects the calculation to ignore the l=0 term, but that's not correct because the l=0 term is part of the sum.

Wait, but the l=0 term is zero so it doesn't contribute.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the sum more accurately.

Compute each term precisely:

l=0: 1 * sin(180°) =0.

l=1:3 * sin(134°)=3 * sin(134°).

Compute sin(134°):

134 degrees is 180-46 degrees.

sin(46) = approx 0.7193398.

So 3 *0.7193398=2.1580194.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 * sin(70)=5 *0.9396926=4.698463.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7*(√3/2)=7 *0.8660254=6.0621778.

l=4:9 * sin(26°)=9 * sin(26°).

Compute sin(26°):

sin(26) ≈0.4383711.

So 9 *0.4383711=3.9453399.

Sum all terms:

2.1580194 +4.698463 = 6.8564824.

+6.0621778 →12.9186602.

+3.9453399 →16.8639901.

So sum≈16.864.

Multiply by 1/k=3.95 fm.

16.864 *3.95 = ?

Compute:

16 *3.95=63.2.

0.864 *3.95.

0.8 *3.95=3.16.

0.064 *3.95=0.2512.

So 3.16 +0.2512=3.4112.

Total:63.2 +3.4112=66.6112 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects the sum to be multiplied by (2l+1) * sin(δ_l), not 2δ_l.

Wait, wait a second, maybe I misapplied the formula. Let me double-check the formula.

The formula for the imaginary part is Im f(θ) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) P_l( cosθ ).

Yes, that's correct.

So, perhaps I shouldn't have multiplied by 2 in sin(2δ_l). Wait, no, that's correct.

Hmm.

Another possibility: perhaps the phase shifts δ_l are not given in degrees, but in radians.

Wait, that's possible. Let me see.

If δ_l is in radians, then 90 degrees is π/2 radians, which is about 1.5708 radians.

So, for each l:

l=0: δ0=90°=π/2 → 2δ0=π → sin(π)=0.

l=1: δ1=67°=67*(π/180)=approx 1.16937 radians. 2δ1=2.3387 radians. sin(2.3387)≈0.7004.

So 3 * 0.7004≈2.1012.

l=2: δ2=55°=55*(π/180)=0.95993 radians. 2δ2=1.91986 radians. sin(1.91986)=approx 0.9440.

5 *0.9440=4.72.

l=3: δ3=30°=π/6=0.523599 radians. 2δ3=1.047198 radians. sin(1.047198)=sin(60°)=√3/2≈0.8660254.

7 *0.8660254≈6.062178.

l=4: δ4=13°=13*(π/180)=0.226893 radians. 2δ4=0.453785 radians. sin(0.453785)≈0.4365.

9 *0.4365≈3.9285.

Now, sum all terms:

2.1012+4.72=6.8212 +6.062178=12.8834 +3.9285=16.8119.

So sum≈16.8119.

Multiply by 1/k=3.95 fm.

16.8119 *3.95 ≈66.19 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm. So perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, but even then, it's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps I should sum (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] instead of the imaginary part, but that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute 16.864 *3.95.

16.864 *3.95:

Compute 16 *3.95=63.2.

0.864 *3.95.

Compute 0.8 *3.95=3.16.

0.06 *3.95=0.237.

0.004 *3.95=0.0158.

So total 3.16 +0.237=3.397 +0.0158=3.4128.

So 63.2 +3.4128=66.6128 fm.

So approximately 66.61 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation of k. Let me compute k again.

k = E/(ħ c) = 50 MeV / 197.33 MeV fm^{-1} ≈0.25338 fm^{-1}.

So, 1/k =3.952 fm.

So, 16.864 *3.952 ≈?

Compute 16 *3.952=63.232.

0.864 *3.952.

Compute 0.8 *3.952=3.1616.

0.06 *3.952=0.23712.

0.004 *3.952=0.015808.

So sum 3.1616 +0.23712=3.39872 +0.015808=3.414528.

Total:63.232 +3.414528=66.646528 fm.

Which is about 66.65 fm.

But the options are way off. So perhaps there's a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin(δ_l) instead of 2δ_l.

Wait, that would change things.

So, if the formula is (2l+1) sin(δ_l), then:

Compute each term:

l=0:1 * sin(90)=1*1=1.

l=1:3*sin(67)=3*0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5*sin(55)=5*0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7*sin(30)=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9*sin(13)=9*0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum:1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455=13.38205.

Multiply by 1/k=3.95 fm →13.38205 *3.95 ≈52.93 fm.

Still not matching any options.

So that's not the case.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm stuck because I can't see where the mistake is. My calculation leads me to ~66.6 fm, but the options are much larger. Perhaps I should think outside the box.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for ħ c. I used 197.33 MeV fm, but perhaps the exact value is 197.33 MeV·fm. Let me check that.

Yes, it's approximately 197.33 MeV·fm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the phase shifts given are in degrees, but the formula requires them to be in radians. So I have to convert them.

Wait, I tried that earlier, but it didn't change much, but perhaps the precise calculation would make a difference.

Compute each term again with radians.

l=0: 0.

l=1:3 * sin(2 * (67 * π/180 )) 

67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 radians.

2 *1.16937=2.33874 radians.

sin(2.33874)≈sin(134 degrees)≈0.71934.

Wait, same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sines more accurately.

Compute for l=1:

2δ1 in radians:2*(67 degrees in radians)=2*(1.16937)=2.33874 rad.

sin(2.33874)=≈0.71934.

So 3 *0.71934=2.15802.

Yes.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value using a calculator.

Wait, but without a calculator, it's hard to get more precise.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the sum up to l=4, but the phase shifts beyond l=4 are zero, which I have ignored, but perhaps they are not zero.

But the problem says to ignore the rest, so I think I did it right.

Wait, the given phase shifts are δ0=90, δ1=67, δ2=55, δ3=30, δ4=13, so up to l=4, and the rest are zero.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I've done the calculations correctly, but the option doesn't match. Perhaps the correct answer is option D) 251.271 fm, but I can't see why.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum, but I can't see where.

Wait, I think I need to recheck the sum.

Wait, adding the terms again:

l=0:0.

l=1:2.158.

l=2:4.69846.

l=3:6.062178.

l=4:3.945339.

Adding:

0 +2.158=2.158.

+4.69846=6.85646.

+6.062178=12.918638.

+3.945339=16.863977.

So sum is approximately 16.864.

Multiply by 3.952 →16.864 *3.952 =approx 66.64 fm.

Wait, perhaps the options are wrong. Or perhaps the question is about the real part, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps I should include the contribution from the l=0 term.

Wait, the l=0 term is 1 * sin(180) =0, so it doesn't contribute.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l). So 16.864 * (1/(2*0.25338)).

1/(2*0.25338)= 1/0.50676≈1.973.

16.864 *1.973 ≈33.23 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ ... ], but I'm missing a factor of (e^{i l phi} ), which at phi=0 is 1.

No, that won't change anything.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses (2l+1) e^{i l phi}, but at phi=0, it's 1.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I've exhausted all possibilities and can't find where the mistake is. According to my calculations, the correct answer should be approximately 66.64 fm, but this isn't one of the options. Perhaps the correct answer is option D) 251.271 fm, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the sum. Let me compute it again:

Wait, let's compute each term more accurately.

l=0:0.

l=1:3 * sin(134°) =3 *0.71934=2.15802.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 *0.9396926=4.698463.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7 *0.8660254=6.0621778.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9 *0.4383711=3.9453399.

Sum: 2.15802 +4.698463=6.856483 +6.0621778=12.9186608 +3.9453399=16.8639999.

So sum≈16.864.

Multiply by 3.952:16.864 *3.952.

Compute:

16 *3.952=63.232.

0.864 *3.952:

Compute 0.8 *3.952=3.1616.

0.06 *3.952=0.23712.

0.004 *3.952=0.015808.

Sum:3.1616+0.23712=3.39872 +0.015808=3.414528.

Total:63.232 +3.414528=66.646528 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D:251.271 fm, but why?

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Perhaps the imaginary part is (1/k) multiplied by the sum of (2l+1) sin(δ_l).

Wait, let me try that.

Compute each term with sin(δ_l):

l=0: sin(90)=1 →1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3 *0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5 *0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum:1+2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455=13.38205.

Multiply by 1/k=3.952 fm →13.38205 *3.952≈52.93 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is multiplied by (4π/k), but I'm not sure.

Wait, if I multiply the sum by (4π/k), 4π≈12.566.

16.864 *12.566=212.05, then divide by k=0.25338:

212.05/0.25338≈836.5 fm.

But that's option A:87163.4 fm is way larger.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is multiplied by (2π/k), which would give 16.864 *6.2832≈106.36, divided by 0.25338 →420.3 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have computed the sum as the real part instead of the imaginary part, but that's not what the question asks.

Hmm.

At this point, given that none of my calculations match the options, I think I might have made a mistake somewhere, but I can't figure it out. Since the calculated value doesn't match any option, perhaps I'm missing a key point.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are given in units of π radians, not degrees. For example, δ0=90° is π/2 radians, but perhaps the given phase shifts are in units of π.

Wait, that's a possibility. Let me check.

If δ0=90°, which is π/2 radians, then a phase shift of 90 would actually be (90 * π/180) = π/2.

But if the phase shifts are given in units where 90 represents 90 radians, which would be impossible, that's not the case.

So that's probably not the case.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in terms of their values multiplied by (2π), but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the question is about the total cross-section, but then the formula would involve (4π/k²) Im f(0) = σ_total.

But the problem isn't asking for the cross-section; it's about the imaginary part of f(0).

Hmm.

I'm stuck. I think I'll have to proceed with the conclusion that the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps the intended answer is option D)251.271 fm.

Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k as E/(ħ c) =50e6 eV / (197.33 MeV fm^{-1}).

But 50e6 eV is 50 MeV.

Wait, so 50 MeV / 197.33 MeV fm^{-1} =0.25338 fm^{-1}.

Which is correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses 1/(2k) instead of 1/k.

In that case, 1/(2k)=1.976 fm.

So, 16.864 *1.976≈33.23 fm.

But that's not any option.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (1/k) multiplied by sum (2l+1) [e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] * (sinθ)^l.

But at θ=0, sinθ=0, which would make all terms zero, which is not the case.

So that can't be right.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I've done as much as I can and perhaps the intended answer is option D)251.271 fm, but I can't figure out why.

Wait, wait another thought: perhaps I should compute the sum of (2l+1) * sin(δ_l), not 2δ_l.

So, let me compute that.

l=0:1 * sin(90)=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5 *0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 *0.22495=2.02455.

Sum:1+2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455=13.38205.

Multiply by 1/k=3.952 →13.38205 *3.952≈52.93 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are in units where δ0=90 corresponds to 90 radians, which is impossible, but let's see:

If δ0=90 radians, then 2δ0=180 radians.

sin(180 radians)=sin(180)=0. But that would make all terms zero, which isn't the case.

So that's not the case.

Hmm.

After trying all possibilities and not finding a match, I think I must have made a mistake in the approach. Perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option D)251.271 fm, but I can't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a calculation error. Let me compute 16.864 *3.952.

Compute 16.864 ×3.952:

Break it down:

16 ×3.952=63.232.

0.864 ×3.952:

Compute 0.8 ×3.952=3.1616.

0.06 ×3.952=0.23712.

0.004 ×3.952=0.015808.

Now, sum:3.1616 +0.23712=3.39872 +0.015808=3.414528.

Total:63.232 +3.414528=66.646528 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the options are misaligned, and the intended answer is option D)251.271 fm, which is approximately 66.6465 * (251.271 /66.6465 ) → around 3.76 times larger.

But why would that factor appear?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps the correct value of k is 0.0507 fm^{-1}, which would make 1/k=19.73 fm.

Then, 16.864 *19.73≈332.3 fm, which is option A:87163.4 is way too large.

Wait, no, that's not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the sum of (2l+1) sin(δ_l), not 2δ_l. But I don't think that's correct.

Wait, let me compute the sum with sin(δ_l).

As before, sum≈13.38205.

Multiply by 1/k=3.952 →13.38205 *3.952≈52.93 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in units of 1e-15 m, which is femtometers, which I'm using.

I'm at a loss. So perhaps the correct answer is option D)251.271 fm, but I can't see the calculation path leading there.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts are given in radians, but perhaps I should have used sin^2(δ_l) or something else. But that doesn't make sense.

Another approach: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (1/k) multiplied by sum (2l+1) * (1 - cos(2δ_l)).

Because Im f(θ) would then be (1/k) sum (2l+1) * (1 - cos(2δ_l)).

Wait, let me see:

( e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) = e^{i δ_l} ( e^{i δ_l} - e^{-i δ_l} ) = 2i e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

So Im(f) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) * 2 sin δ_l cos δ_l.

Because Im(e^{2iδ_l} -1)=2 sin δ_l cos δ_l.

So Im(f) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) * 2 sin δ_l cos δ_l.

Wait, that's a different approach. Let me compute that.

So for each l, compute (2l+1) * 2 sin δ_l cos δ_l.

Compute each term:

l=0: 1 * 2 *sin(90) cos(90)= 2 *1 *0=0.

l=1:3 *2 * sin(67) cos(67).

sin(67)=0.9205, cos(67)=0.3907.

So 3 *2 *0.9205 *0.3907 ≈6 *0.360 →≈2.16.

l=2:5 *2 * sin(55) cos(55).

sin(55)=0.8192, cos(55)=0.5736.

5 *2 *0.8192 *0.5736 ≈10 *0.470 →≈4.7.

l=3:7 *2 * sin(30) cos(30).

sin(30)=0.5, cos(30)=√3/2≈0.8660.

7 *2 *0.5 *0.8660 ≈14 *0.4330 →≈6.062.

l=4:9 *2 * sin(13) cos(13).

sin(13)=0.22495, cos(13)=0.9744.

9 *2 *0.22495 *0.9744 ≈18 *0.2193 →≈3.947.

Sum all terms:

0 +2.16=2.16 +4.7=6.86 +6.062=12.922 +3.947=16.869.

Multiply by 1/k=3.952 →16.869 *3.952≈66.66 fm.

Same as before.

Hmm.

So, I'm confident that my calculation is correct, but the answer doesn't match any option. Perhaps the correct answer is not listed, or perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. But given the options, I'll have to make an educated guess. Among the options, option C)177.675 is about twice my calculated value. But I don't see why that would be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum should be multiplied by 2, giving 133.3 fm, which is still not an option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula uses the square of the sum. But that would lead to a much larger number.

Hmm.

Given all this, I think the correct answer based on my calculations is approximately 66.64 fm, but since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. However, among the options, option D)251.271 fm is the closest to my calculated value multiplied by about 3.76, but I don't know why that would be the case.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the units for k.

Wait, another approach: maybe the wave number k is calculated using the relativistic expression differently.

E = gamma m c^2.

p = gamma m v.

But v ≈ c for high energies.

So, p ≈ gamma m c.

Then, k = p / ħ = (gamma m c) / ħ.

But gamma = E/(m c^2) →50 /0.511 ≈97.828.

So, gamma ≈97.828.

Thus, p = gamma m c =97.828 * m c.

Then, k = (gamma m c)/ ħ = (97.828 * m c ) / ħ.

But ħ c ≈197.33 MeV fm.

So, m c = (0.511 MeV) / c^2 * c = 0.511 MeV /c.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, using the relation:

k = (sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 )) / (ħ c) ) * c/(ħ c) ?

Wait, perhaps I should compute it again.

E =50 MeV.

m c^2 =0.511 MeV.

sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 )=sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2 )≈50 MeV.

So, p =50 MeV /c.

k = p/(ħ ) = (50 MeV/c) / ħ.

But ħ c =197.33 MeV fm.

So, ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

So, k = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) ) = 50/(197.33) fm^{-1}.

Which gives k≈0.25338 fm^{-1}.

So, 1/k≈3.952 fm.

Hmm.

So, I think my calculation is correct, but the options don't match. Perhaps the intended answer is option D)251.271 fm, but I can't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct calculation leads to option D.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (4π/k) times the sum, which would make:

4π≈12.566.

12.566 *16.864≈212.05.

Multiply by 3.952 →212.05 *3.952=839.2 fm.

Which is close to option A)87163.4 fm, but not quite.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I've done all I can and will have to conclude that the correct answer is approximately 66.64 fm, but since it's not an option, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or the options provided.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( f(0) \), for elastic electron scattering at an energy of \( 50 \, \text{MeV} \), given the phase shifts \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \), with higher \( l \)-values ignored. The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is expressed as:

\[
\text{Im} \, f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) \sin(2\delta_l),
\]

where \( k \) is the wave number, related to the electron's energy by \( k = \frac{E}{\hbar c} \). Using \( \hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV} \cdot \text{fm}^{-1} \), the wave number is calculated as:

\[
k = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}, \quad \text{so} \, \frac{1}{k} \approx 3.95 \, \text{fm}.
\]

The sum is computed for \( l = 0 \) to \( l = 4 \), with contributions from each term:

- \( l = 0 \): \( (2l + 1) \sin(2\delta_0) = 1 \cdot \sin(180^\circ) = 0 \),
- \( l = 1 \): \( 3 \cdot \sin(134^\circ) \approx 3 \cdot 0.7193 = 2.158 \),
- \( l = 2 \): \( 5 \cdot \sin(110^\circ) \approx 5 \cdot 0.9397 = 4.699 \),
- \( l = 3 \): \( 7 \cdot \sin(60^\circ) \approx 7 \cdot 0.8660 = 6.062 \),
- \( l = 4 \): \( 9 \cdot \sin(26^\circ) \approx 9 \cdot 0.4384 = 3.946 \).

Summing these contributions gives:

\[
\text{Total sum} = 0 + 2.158 + 4.699 + 6.062 + 3.946 \approx 16.865.
\]

The imaginary part of \( f(0) \) is then:

\[
\text{Im} \, f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \cdot \text{Total sum} = 3.95 \cdot 16.865 \approx 66.64 \, \text{fm}.
\]

This result does not match any of the provided options. A detailed reanalysis of the calculations confirms the consistency of the approach, but the discrepancy suggests either an issue with the problem's options or a missing factor in the interpretation of the formula. Given the available choices, the closest plausible answer is **D) 251.271 fm**, though the reasoning for this discrepancy remains unclear.
