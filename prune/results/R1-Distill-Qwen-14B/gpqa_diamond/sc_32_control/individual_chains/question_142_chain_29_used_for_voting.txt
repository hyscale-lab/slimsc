Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question in front of me, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. Oh right, density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed rather than pure.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. I think that's a maximally mixed state. Because when you have a completely mixed state, it's a diagonal matrix with equal probabilities for each state, right? So for a single qubit, the density matrix would have 1/2 in the diagonal elements (since it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) multiplied by 1/2), and zeros elsewhere. 

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubit space. I remember that the Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. Pure states are on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states are inside. The Bloch vector gives the coordinates of the point in this space. 

Wait, the Bloch vector for a state is given by r = (x, y, z), right? And for a pure state |ψ⟩ = cos(θ/2)|0⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|1⟩, the Bloch vector is (x, y, z) = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But for mixed states, how does that work?

Oh, right! For a density matrix ρ, the Bloch vector components can be found using the formula:

x = (ρ_{01} + ρ_{10}) / 2
y = (ρ_{01} - ρ_{10}) / (2i)
z = (ρ_{00} - ρ_{11}) / 2

Wait, but sometimes I get confused with the exact expressions. Let me think again. Alternatively, I've heard that the density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector. So if I can write ρ in this form, I can find r.

In this problem, ρ is given as (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute each component. Let's write the density matrix in terms of the computational basis.

|0><0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them and dividing by 2 gives ρ = [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. 

So ρ is a diagonal matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal. Now, let's express this in terms of identity and Pauli matrices. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so (I)/2 is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]], which is exactly the same as our ρ. So ρ = (I) / 2. 

Wait, but according to the earlier formula, ρ would be (I + r·σ)/2. So if I set this equal to ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, then (I)/2 = (I + r·σ)/2. Subtracting, I get 0 = r·σ. That implies each component of r is zero because the Pauli matrices are independent. So r is (0,0,0). 

But wait, I thought the maximally mixed state was at the origin of the Bloch sphere. Because the Bloch sphere has radius 1, and the origin is the completely mixed state. So if r is (0,0,0), then yes, that makes sense. So the correct option would be C) r=(0,0,0).

Looking back at the options:

A) (1,1,0) → that would be a point outside the sphere, but maybe the options are just coordinates, not necessarily on the sphere.

B) (0,0,1) → that's the point at the north pole, which would correspond to the pure state |0⟩, but I don't think so because our state is mixed.

C) (0,0,0) → correct for the completely mixed state.

D) (1,1,1) → way outside, not likely.

So the answer should be option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (x, y, z) \) is used to describe the state of a qubit. For a density matrix \( \rho \), the Bloch vector can be determined using the relation \( \rho = \frac{1}{2} (I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}) \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) are the Pauli matrices.

For the given \( \rho \), it is diagonal with equal elements \( \rho_{00} = \rho_{11} = \frac{1}{2} \) and off-diagonal elements \( \rho_{01} = \rho_{10} = 0 \). This corresponds to \( \rho = \frac{1}{2} I \), which implies \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \). This represents the completely mixed state, which is located at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Analyzing the options:
- **A) \( r = (1, 1, 0) \):** This corresponds to a point outside the Bloch sphere, which is not valid for a mixed state.
- **B) \( r = (0, 0, 1) \):** This corresponds to the pure state \( |0\rangle \), which is not the case here since \( \rho \) is mixed.
- **C) \( r = (0, 0, 0) \):** This correctly represents the completely mixed state, consistent with the given \( \rho \).
- **D) \( r = (1, 1, 1) \):** This corresponds to a point outside the Bloch sphere, which is not valid.

Thus, the correct geometrical position of the given density matrix in qubit space is \( r = (0, 0, 0) \).
