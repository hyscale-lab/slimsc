Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because enthalpy of neutralization can be a tricky topic. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three solutions are mixed: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for these reactions can be measured, typically in kJ/mol.

First, I need to figure out the moles of each acid and base involved. Because the reaction is between acids and a base, I should probably determine the total moles of H+ ions from the acids and the moles of OH- ions from the base. Then, see which one is the limiting reactant, as that will determine how much reaction occurs.

Let's list out the given data:

- HCl: 500 mL (0.5 L) of 0.2 M solution.
- H2SO4: 300 mL (0.3 L) of 0.3 M solution.
- Ba(OH)2: 200 mL (0.2 L) of 0.5 M solution.

Wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but since it's a diprotic acid, each mole gives two moles of H+. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and each mole gives two moles of OH- because it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

So, let's calculate the moles.

For HCl:
Molarity (M) = moles / volume(L)
Moles of HCl = 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Since each HCl gives one H+, moles of H+ from HCl = 0.1 mol.

For H2SO4:
Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each H2SO4 gives 2 H+, so moles of H+ from H2SO4 = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Now for the base, Ba(OH)2:
Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH- ions, so moles of OH- = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol.

The neutralization reaction between H+ and OH- is: H+ + OH- → H2O. The enthalpy change for this reaction is usually given as approximately -57.3 kJ per mole of H2O formed. Wait, but wait! I think H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so maybe I should consider how many H+ ions are available.

Wait, but in this case, all the H+ from HCl and H2SO4 are available because they're strong acids. So the total H+ is 0.28 mol, and OH- is 0.2 mol.

So, the OH- is the limiting reactant here because 0.2 mol < 0.28 mol. That means all the OH- will react, and some H+ will be left.

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The neutralization is H+ + OH- → H2O. So moles of H+ available: 0.28, OH-: 0.2. So the OH- will be consumed, and the H+ will have 0.08 left. So the moles of water formed is 0.2 moles, right?

So the amount of H+ that reacts is 0.2 moles, and OH- is 0.2 moles. So the enthalpy change would be based on how much reacts. Since each mole of H2O releases about 57.3 kJ, the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ. Wait, but wait, the options are in kcal and kJ, so I need to check the units.

Wait, but wait. Oh, no, wait! The enthalpy of neutralization is usually expressed per mole of acid reacting, or per mole of H+ reacting. So if the reaction is neutralization of H+ with OH-, each mole produces one mole of water. So the enthalpy change per mole is -57.3 kJ or sometimes given as -1.0 kcal per mole (but wait, 57.3 kJ is about 13.7 kcal, which seems conflicting). Hmm, perhaps I should double-check the conversion.

Wait, 1 cal is 4.184 J. So 1 kcal is 4184 J, which is 4.184 kJ. So 57.3 kJ is about 13.7 kcal (since 57.3 / 4.184 ≈ 13.7). Wait, but the options have some in kJ and others in kcal. Let me think about the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, my calculation from before gave me -11.46 kJ. So if I convert that to kcal, 11.46 kJ * (1 kcal /4.184 kJ) ≈ 2.738 kcal, but negative, so -2.74 kcal. Hmm, but that's option A. But wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the stoichiometry.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the equivalent points. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: The net ionic equation is H+ + OH- → H2O, which has a ΔH of -57.3 kJ per mole of H+.

So, in this case, the moles of H+ reacting is 0.2 moles. So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.5 kJ. But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is more than that. Hmm, that doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is in kcal.

Wait, wait a second. Did I miscalculate the moles?

Wait, let's recheck the moles:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles → 0.2 OH-.

So, total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So moles reacting is 0.2 moles H+ and 0.2 moles OH-.

Thus, the reaction produces 0.2 moles of H2O. So ΔH = 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that's not matching. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the enthalpy value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the total enthalpy when all solutions are mixed, considering the excess H+.

Wait, but the problem says "enthalpy of neutralization". Neutralization usually refers to the reaction where an acid and base are neutralized, but in this case, we have multiple acids and one base. So perhaps we should consider all the H+ and OH- and find out how much acid is neutralized.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the equivalent points, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is calculated per mole of H+ or OH- consumed, but perhaps the way the problem is structured is that the total moles of H+ (from both HCl and H2SO4) must be considered, but the OH- only neutralizes a portion.

Wait, but no, in the problem, all the H+ and OH- are in solution. So, let me think about which H+ reacts with the OH-.

The OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with H+ from the acids. Which H+ will it react with first? Well, in solution, all H+ ions are available, so it doesn't matter which acid they come from. So, 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+ to form 0.2 moles of water.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ. But looking back at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger. Hmm, that suggests I might have a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles calculation. Let me double-check.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol. Correct.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+. Correct.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol. Correct.

So the calculations seem right. So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ, which is about -11.46 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, and option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, hold on. Hmm, the units are a key point here.

Wait, in the problem, the options mix kJ and kcal. So perhaps the given ΔH is in kcal/mol, not kJ. Let me think again.

If the enthalpy of neutralization is given as -57.3 kJ/mol, which is -13.7 kcal/mol (since 57.3 kJ is about 13.7 kcal). So for 0.2 moles, it would be 0.2 * (-13.7) = -2.74 kcal. Which is close to option A: -2.72 kcal.

But that doesn't align with the -11.46 kJ I calculated earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization.

Wait, maybe I confused kJ and kcal. Let me compute 0.2 moles times -57.3 kJ: that's -11.46 kJ. If the options are in kJ, then the closest would be option D: -16.0 kJ, but that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is in kcal, so converting 11.46 kJ to kcal: 11.46 / 4.184 ≈ 2.738 kcal. So about -2.74 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, wait, the problem is asking for the enthalpy of neutralization when these are mixed. So the total neutralization is for 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacting, releasing 11.46 kJ of energy, which would be 2.74 kcal.

But why is option B -11.42 kcal? That would be if it's 0.2 moles times 57.3 kJ, but that's 11.46 kJ, which is about 2.74 kcal. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the stoichiometry. Let me think again: when mixing these three solutions, the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4. The OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

But in the reaction, each mole of H+ reacts with a mole of OH-. So if OH- is 0.2 moles, H+ is 0.28, so 0.2 moles react. So the total enthalpy released is 0.2 * 57.3 kJ (but since it's exothermic, it's negative) → 11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have that. Option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recheck the moles.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 mol → 0.2 OH-.

So, OH- is 0.2 mol, H+ is 0.28. So all OH- reacts, but H+ has 0.08 left.

So, the reaction produces 0.2 moles H2O, so ΔH = 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

Wait, but option D is -16.0 kJ, which is more than that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait a minute, perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization of the excess H+ as well? Or maybe there's another reaction happening.

Wait, another thought: after the neutralization, there's some excess H+ left. But that doesn't release any additional enthalpy because the neutralization is done. So the only enthalpy released is from the 0.2 moles of H+ reacting.

Hmm, so that would make the ΔH about -11.46 kJ or about -2.74 kcal. But the options don't have that. Wait, unless the problem uses a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization, like -57.3 kcal per mole, which would be way too high, but let's check:

If ΔH is -57.3 kcal/mol, then for 0.2 moles, it would be 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kcal, which is close to option B (-11.42 kcal). So perhaps the problem uses that value. Oh wait, wait! I think I might have confused the units. Let me check the standard enthalpy of neutralization. Typically, it's about 57.3 kJ per mole (exothermic, so negative). But sometimes, it's given as 1.0 kcal per mole, which is incorrect because 57.3 kJ is about 13.7 kcal, which is much larger than 1 kcal.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the equivalent of one mole of H+ as 1 equivalent, and one mole of OH- as 1 equivalent. So, in that case, the enthalpy per equivalent is about 57.3 kJ. So, the calculation is correct as I did earlier—0.2 equivalents reacting, leading to -11.46 kJ. But the options don't have that. Wait, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher than -11.46. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial stoichiometry because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. Wait, but I accounted for that by multiplying by 2. So that shouldn't be the issue.

Wait, another thought: when mixing the solutions, the volumes add up. So the total volume is 500 + 300 + 200 = 1000 mL or 1 L. But I don't think that affects the moles calculation, as moles are based on concentration and volume.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the reaction produces more than one mole of water per mole of acid or base. For example, Ba(OH)2 has two OH- ions, so each mole contributes two equivalents. H2SO4 has two H+ per mole, so each mole contributes two equivalents. So, perhaps when calculating equivalents, but I'm not sure how that affects the enthalpy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and find the difference to find the excess, but the neutralization only occurs for the limiting reagent.

Wait, another approach—what if the problem is looking for the total enthalpy released, but considering each acid's neutralization separately. For example, perhaps considering the neutralization of HCl and H2SO4 with Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and can provide 2 moles of OH- per mole. So perhaps each mole of Ba(OH)2 can neutralize two moles of H+.

HCl provides 0.1 moles H+, H2SO4 provides 0.18 moles H+.

Total H+ is 0.28 moles.

Ba(OH)2 provides 0.2 moles OH-.

But wait, each Ba(OH)2 gives two OH-, so the OH- is 0.2 moles. So how much can they neutralize?

Each OH- neutralizes one H+. So 0.2 moles OH- neutralizes 0.2 moles H+.

So the remaining H+ is 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles.

So the amount of H+ that reacted is 0.2 moles. So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ. So the answer is approximately -11.46 kJ.

But looking at the options, the closest is option D: -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different ΔH value.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid and that when it reacts with a base, it releases two H+ ions, each contributing to the neutralization. But I think I accounted for that already.

Wait, could there be another reaction happening here, like a precipitation reaction? For example, when mixing H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, BaSO4 precipitate might form. But the problem doesn't mention anything about precipitates or other products. So perhaps it's just considering the neutralization reaction, not any other reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy per mole of acid or base, not per mole of H+ or OH-. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the problem is considering the neutralization of each acid separately. For example, first, HCl reacts with Ba(OH)2, then any remaining H+ from H2SO4 reacts.

Let me think about that. HCl (0.1 mol H+) reacts with Ba(OH)2 (0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-).

So, the HCl will neutralize 0.1 moles of OH-. But Ba(OH)2 provides 0.2 moles OH-, so after neutralizing HCl, there's 0.1 moles OH- left.

Then, the H2SO4 provides 0.18 moles H+. These will react with the remaining 0.1 moles OH-, neutralizing 0.1 moles H+ and 0.1 moles OH-, producing 0.1 moles H2O.

So, the total H+ neutralized is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.1 (from H2SO4) = 0.2 moles. So the total enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ, same as before. So the result is the same.

Hmm, but the options don't have this value. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the options: A is -2.72 kcal, B is -11.42 kcal, C is -3.80 kcal, D is -16.0 kJ.

So, if the calculation is -11.46 kJ, that's approximately -11.5 kJ, but none of the options in kJ match except D: -16.0 kJ, which is about 3.83 kcal.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the problem is using per mole of reaction as per the molarities. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the mixing of all three solutions, but the neutralization only occurs between the acids and the base, but perhaps using equivalents.

Wait, another approach: calculate equivalents for H+ and OH-.

HCl: 0.1 moles H+ → 0.1 equivalents.

H2SO4: 0.09 moles × 2 = 0.18 equivalents.

Total H+ equivalents: 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 moles × 2 = 0.2 equivalents.

So, the OH- is 0.2 equivalents. Thus, the H+ consumed is 0.2 equivalents, leaving 0.08 H+ unreacted. So the neutralization is 0.2 equivalents, leading to 0.2 moles of H2O, as before.

So, the enthalpy is 0.2 × 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ, but negative → -11.46 kJ.

But in the options, the closest is option D (-16.0 kJ), which isn't matching. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. For example, sometimes the value is approximated as 56.9 kJ/mol, but that would be close to 11.38 kJ for 0.2 moles, which is still not matching any option.

Wait, looking at option B: -11.42 kcal. If I compute 0.2 moles × 57.3 kJ/mol = 11.46 kJ, which is 2.74 kcal. So that's option A (-2.72 kcal). But option B is -11.42 kcal, which would be if 0.2 moles × 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ → 11.46 / 4.184 ≈ 2.738 kcal, which is about option A.

But if the problem uses -57.3 kcal/mol as the enthalpy, then 0.2 × (-57.3) = -11.46 kcal, which is option B.

Wait, but I thought the standard value is -57.3 kJ/mol, not kcal. So someone might have used that, leading to option B.

But why would the problem mix units like that? That's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the initial calculations. Let me make a table:

HCl:
Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L.
Molarity = 0.2 M.
Moles HCl = 0.5 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol.
H+ from HCl = 0.1 mol.

H2SO4:
Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L.
Molarity = 0.3 M.
Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 L × 0.3 = 0.09 mol.
H+ from H2SO4 = 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 mol.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2:
Volume = 200 mL = 0.2 L.
Molarity = 0.5 M.
Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.2 × 0.5 = 0.1 mol.
OH- from Ba(OH)2 = 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 mol.

So, H+ available: 0.28, OH-: 0.2. So OH- is limiting, neutralizing 0.2 mol H+.

Thus, moles of H2O formed: 0.2.

Enthalpy change: 0.2 × (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ. So approximately -11.5 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the units.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to be done in kcal. So, 57.3 kJ is about 13.7 kcal. So 0.2 × (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ → -11.46 kJ = -11.46 / 4.184 ≈ -2.738 kcal, which is close to option A (-2.72 kcal). So that would match option A.

Alternatively, if the problem is using the assumption that the enthalpy per mole is -57.3 kcal, which is 57,300 cal/mol → which is different from the standard value.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because 57.3 kJ is 57,300 J, which is 57.3 kJ, not 57.3 kcal. Because 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ. So 57.3 kJ is roughly 13.7 kcal.

So if the problem uses 57.3 kJ/mol, then the answer is -11.46 kJ. But that's not an option in kJ except D, which is -16.0 kJ. Alternatively, maybe the answer is in kcal, which would be approximately -2.74 kcal, matching option A.

Wait, but then why would the problem have option B as -11.42 kcal? Because that would be if they used 57.3 kJ as 57.3 kcal, which is incorrect. Because 57.3 kJ is much less than 57.3 kcal. So perhaps the problem intended to use 57.3 kJ, leading to option D, but none of the options match exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is considering all the H+ from both acids and the OH- from the base, and calculating the total heat released.

Wait, another possibility: the problem is considering that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so the second H+ might not dissociate completely in solution. But since the problem doesn't specify that, I assumed it's a strong acid and both H+ dissociate. However, if for some reason only the first H+ is considered, then H2SO4 would contribute 0.09 × 1 = 0.09 H+ → total H+ = 0.19. Then, OH- is 0.2 → H+ is 0.19, so OH- is in excess. But that complicates things further. Hmm, but I think the problem expects us to treat H2SO4 as a strong acid fully dissociating, providing 2 H+.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Let me check: sometimes, the value is taken as 56.9 kJ/mol, which is very close to 57.3. So for 0.2 moles, it's 0.2 ×56.9 = 11.38 kJ. That's about 11.4 kJ, which is close to option B (but option B is in kcal). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed to the conclusion. Based on the calculations, the enthalpy change is approximately -11.46 kJ, which is about -2.74 kcal. Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close. So the correct answer should be option A.

But wait, option B is -11.42 kcal. Let me compute 0.2 ×57.3 = 11.46 kJ, which is 11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.738 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close. So the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Determine moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - **HCl:**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each HCl molecule contributes 1 H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **H₂SO₄:**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each H₂SO₄ molecule contributes 2 H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **Total H⁺ from acids:**  
     \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Determine moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
   - Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each Ba(OH)₂ molecule contributes 2 OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Identify the limiting reactant:**
   - The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \).  
     The limiting reactant is the one with fewer moles: OH⁻ (0.2 mol) is limiting.

4. **Calculate moles of H₂O formed:**
   - Since OH⁻ is limiting, \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ reacts with \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ to form \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H₂O.

5. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The enthalpy of neutralization per mole of H₂O is approximately \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).  
     Total enthalpy change = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \).

6. **Convert to kcal (if necessary):**
   - \( 1 \, \text{kJ} = 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \), so \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} = -11.46 \times 0.239 = -2.74 \, \text{kcal} \).

7. **Match with the options:**
   - The calculated value of \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \) corresponds to approximately \( -2.74 \, \text{kcal} \), which is closest to option A (\( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \)).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
