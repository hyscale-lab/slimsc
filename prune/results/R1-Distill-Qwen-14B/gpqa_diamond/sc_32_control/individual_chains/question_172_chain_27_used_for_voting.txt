Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures related to the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere is related to the temperature. Oh right, it's something to do with the Boltzmann distribution.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2 for a specific energy level. Oh wait, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I think that the number of atoms in an excited state depends on the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant.

So the ratio of the number of excited atoms in star_1 to star_2 should be given by the Boltzmann factor. Let me write that out. The ratio N1/N2 is equal to exp( (E)/(k T1) ) divided by exp( (E)/(k T2) ), because the energy difference is E.

Wait, no, wait. Oh right, because the energy is higher in the excited state, so the formula is something like N2/N1 = exp(-E/(k T2)) / exp(-E/(k T1)) ), but I might be getting this reversed. Let me think again. Oh wait, the ratio of populations in two energy levels is N_high/N_low = exp( - (E_high - E_low)/(k T) ), but I think E_high is higher than E_low, so E_high - E_low is the energy difference.

Wait in this case, the energy levels are in the iron atoms. So if the energy difference between the two levels is ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, then the ratio of the populations (excited state to ground state, say) is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So for star_1, the ratio is N1_2 / N1_1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star_2, it's N2_2 / N2_1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

Wait no, maybe I got that backwards. Because higher temperature should increase the population of the higher energy state, right? So if the excited state is higher, then at higher T, more atoms are in that state.

Wait, let me clarify. The ratio of the excited state population to the ground state is N2/N1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where N2 is the higher energy level. So if star_1 has twice as excited atoms as star_2, wait wait, actually, the question says that in star_1, the excited atoms are twice as much as in star_2. So for a given transition, the ratio (excited to ground) is higher in star_1.

Wait, more precisely, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So perhaps the ratio of the number of atoms in that excited level compared to some other level (like the ground) is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2.

Wait, maybe the ratio is N1_excited / N1_ground = 2 * (N2_excited / N2_ground). Because star_1 has twice as excited as star_2. Or wait, maybe star_1 has twice as much in the excited state as star_2, but I'm not sure if it's twice the number or twice the ratio. Let me read the question again.

The question says: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm. So maybe the fraction (or the ratio) of excited atoms to the total in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or perhaps it's the absolute number, but I think in stellar atmospheres, the ratio is what's used because the total number of atoms depends on other factors.

But regardless, the key is to write the ratio of the excited state populations.

So for each star, the ratio is N1_excited / N1_ground = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ). Similarly for star_2, N2_excited / N2_ground = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

But the problem says that the excited level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So perhaps, it's N1_excited / N1_ground = 2 * (N2_excited / N2_ground).

Wait, but no, because the total number of atoms is not the same. Maybe the ratio is N1_excited / N1_ground = 2 * (N2_excited / N2_ground). Or perhaps N1_excited = 2 * N2_excited. But that could vary based on the number of atoms, which is probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is such that the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2. So, (N1_excited / N1_ground) = 2 * (N2_excited / N2_ground).

Wait, but I'm not certain about this. Alternatively, it could be that N1_excited is twice N2_excited, but that might not make sense if the stars have different numbers of atoms.

But given that the photospheres are in LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium), the Boltzmann equation applies. So I think the ratio for each star is given by the respective temperatures.

So, the ratio of the excited to ground in star_1 is N1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star_2, N2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). The problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited, so I think that N1 = 2 * N2.

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking natural logs on both sides,

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2) )

Simplify:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

So,

(ΔE) (T1 - T2) ) / ( k T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2)

But wait, let's write this equation clearly:

ΔE/(k) * [ (T1 - T2) ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) ] = ln(2)

But looking at the options, none of them have ΔE in them. So perhaps this approach is missing something, or maybe I made an error in the setup.

Wait, wait, perhaps the ratio is N1_excited / N1_ground = (N2_excited / N2_ground ) * 2.

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking ln,

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Move ΔE terms to one side:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) = ln(2)

Which is the same as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

So,

ln(2) = [ ΔE (T1 - T2) ) ] / (k T1 T2 )

Hmm. But the options don't have ΔE, which suggests that perhaps ΔE is canceled out or perhaps I've made a wrong assumption.

Wait, but wait a second, the given energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. How does that tie into this?

Wait, wait, perhaps I should express it in terms of k. Because k is Boltzmann's constant, which is 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, that's the same value as the given ΔE! Because ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, wait, let me compute:

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

So ΔE = k * (1) J.

Hmm, so ΔE = k * (1 K) * (since 1 K = 1 J/(1.38e-23 J/K) when ΔE is 1.38e-23 J).

Wait, no. Let me calculate ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So substituting back into our equation:

ln(2) = [ (1 K) * (T1 - T2) ) ] / ( T1 T2 )

Which simplifies to:

ln(2) = ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 )

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1*T2). So that's the correct equation.

So the correct equation would be option D.

The question involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (star_1 and star_2) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and it is stated that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann distribution applies.

The ratio of the populations of the excited and ground states for each star is given by:

\[
\frac{N_{\text{excited}}}{N_{\text{ground}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant (\( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)) and \( T \) is the effective temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the ratios are:

\[
\frac{N_{1,\text{excited}}}{N_{1,\text{ground}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad \frac{N_{2,\text{excited}}}{N_{2,\text{ground}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, so:

\[
\frac{N_{1,\text{excited}}}{N_{1,\text{ground}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{N_{2,\text{excited}}}{N_{2,\text{ground}}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann factors:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \( \Delta E / k \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \cdot 1 \, \text{K} \) (because \( \Delta E / k = 1 \)), the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches option D, which states:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation for the effective temperatures is:

**Answer: D**
