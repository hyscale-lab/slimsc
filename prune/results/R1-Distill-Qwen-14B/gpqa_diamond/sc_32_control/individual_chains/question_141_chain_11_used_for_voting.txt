Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction? The options are A) 4, B) 1, C) 2, D) 3.

Hmm. Wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Oh, right, that's a typo, I think. Benzene with a bromine on position 1 and a deuterium (d) on position 2. Or wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene? That makes sense. So the structure would be a benzene ring with Br in position 1 and a D (deuterium) in position 2.

The reagent is NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. But wait, in aromatic chemistry, what does NaNH2 do? Oh right, it's used for dehydrohalogenation, especially in elimination reactions. But wait, wait. Bromobenzene is a benzene ring with a Br substituent. But if there's a deuterium adjacent, maybe it's about elimination.

Wait, benzene rings are generally pretty stable. But under strong bases, what happens? Let me think. Oh, if the compound is a bromobenzene, and adjacent to Br is a deuterium, maybe it's about a benzene ring undergoing some sort of elimination or substitution.

Wait, but wait. The reaction conditions are NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I think this is a dehydrohalogenation. So NaNH2 is a strong base. In such conditions, it can abstract a proton (or a deuteron?) adjacent to the leaving group, leading to elimination. But wait, in aromatic substitution, elimination would form a double bond, but benzene is already a ring with conjugated double bonds. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzyne intermediate. Right! The formation of benzyne. Let me recall: when a bromobenzene derivative is treated with a strong base, especially in the presence of a good leaving group, elimination can occur to form a triple bond (or actually, a diradical in the case of benzyne) which is a very reactive intermediate.

But wait, the starting material needs to have two adjacent leaving groups or something that can eliminate. Oh, wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, so Br is at position 1, D at 2. So positions 1 and 2 each have substituents.

Wait, but D is a hydrogen isotope and a poor leaving group. Hmm. Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution. But substitution reactions on aromatic rings typically require activating groups. Bromine is a deactivating group, so substitution might not be favored unless under very strong conditions.

Alternatively, since the solvent is ammonia, which is aprotic, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but benzene rings are not good at SN2 reactions because of the ring's structure. So maybe elimination is more likely.

Wait, in the case of benzyne formation, you need two adjacent leaving groups. For example, 1,2-dihalobenzenes can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form benzyne. But in this case, the substituents are Br and D. Wait, D is not a leaving group, so maybe that's not the case. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the D is a hydrogen that the base can abstract. So NaNH2 is a strong base, so it might deprotonate the compound. But where is the H adjacent to Br? Because in 1-bromo-2-d benzene, the H would be at position 2, which is deuterated. So wait, the H at position 3? Let me number the benzene ring: positions 1 (Br), 2 (D), then positions 3, 4, etc. So the H adjacent to Br is at position 2 (but it's D, so not available), and position 6. So the H at position 6 is adjacent to Br (position 1). Wait, benzene is a ring, so position 1 is next to positions 2 and 6.

So the base (NH2^-) would abstract a proton that's adjacent to Br. But in this compound, position 2 is D, so the H at position 6 is adjacent to Br. So the base will abstract H from position 6, leading to a carbanion adjacent to Br. Then, Br would leave as Br^-.

Wait, so that would form a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 6, but that's not very stable. Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. But wait, in benzyne, you have a triple bond between two carbons, which were adjacent substituents.

Wait, but in this case, only one substituent is Br, and the other is D. So if the base abstracts a proton from position 6 (adjacent to Br at 1), then Br would leave, forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 6? Or maybe between positions 1 and 2?

Wait, maybe I'm getting the positions wrong. Let me draw the benzene ring. Let's assume the benzene is a hexagon with position 1 at the top. So position 1 is Br, position 2 is D. Then, the adjacent positions to 1 (Br) are position 2 (D) and position 6. So the Hydrogen at position 6 is adjacent to Br.

So when NaNH2 abstracts that H, we lose Br^- and form a triple bond between carbons 1 and 6? Wait, but that would require the elimination of H and Br from adjacent positions. Because for benzyne, you need two adjacent substituents that can leave, like two bromines. Then, eliminating both to form a triple bond.

Wait, but in this case, only one Br. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. Let's think about that. Since NaNH2 is a strong base, maybe it acts as a base, abstracting a proton (or deuteron) from the ring. But deprotonating where? The ring is usually deprotonated at positions that are ortho, para, or meta to the substituent.

Wait, the compound is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So the Br is at position 1, D at position 2. So the possible sites for deprotonation would be positions 3,4,5, etc., but the ring's acidity is affected by the substituents.

Wait, but Br is a strong deactivating group, so the ring is less acidic, making deprotonation difficult. But perhaps under strong basic conditions, it's possible.

If the base abstracts a proton, say at position 3, that's meta to Br. Then, maybe a substitution occurs. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The reaction conditions are NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is used in the Birch reduction, but that's for arenes and usually gives dihydro derivatives. But wait, Birch reduction uses NH3 and NaNH2, and the solvent is usually ethereal, like ethanol or another solvent. Wait, Birch reduction reduces the aromatic ring to a dihydro derivative, but that's when the ring is activated, like with strong activating groups. Benzene itself under Birch conditions would give cyclohexadiene or something.

But in this case, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. Would Birch reduction apply here? Maybe not, since the substituent is deactivating.

Alternatively, think about elimination. Another possibility is that the D is a leaving group, but deuterium is a poor leaving group, so that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps it's an elimination reaction where the D is replaced by a leaving group. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Or maybe it's a substitution where D is part of the ring, and somehow the Br leaves, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where D is replaced by something. But NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile. So substitution would need a good leaving group and a nucleophile. But I don't see a nucleophile here besides NH2^-.

Wait, but if NaNH2 abstracts a proton to form a benzene carbanion, maybe that could lead to a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But aromatic rings typically undergo electrophilic substitution, not nucleophilic, unless they're activated. Since Br is a deactivating group, the ring is less reactive towards nucleophilic substitution.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a negative charge, which could then react. But I'm not sure about this.

Wait, going back to benzyne formation. For benzyne, you need two leaving groups adjacent to each other. So for example, 1,2-dibromobenzene can eliminate HBr twice to form benzyne. But in this case, we have Br at 1 and D at 2. D is not a leaving group, so can't eliminate with Br.

So maybe the starting material doesn't have two leaving groups. Hmm. So perhaps no benzyne formation occurs here.

Wait, what if the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to a carbanion, which then eliminates Br^-? That would form a bond between the Br's carbon and the adjacent carbon, creating a triple bond. So it's like a single elimination, not a double elimination.

Wait, in that case, the structure would have a triple bond between carbons 1 and 2. So would that form a triple bond between 1 and 2? But the D is at position 2. Wait, no, the D is at position 2, so when the base abstracts the H at position 6 (adjacent to Br), elimination would form a bond between 1 and 6. But that's not adjacent. Hmm, maybe I'm not getting this right.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't involve elimination. Maybe it's a substitution where the Br is replaced by something else. But what? NaNH2 is a strong base, but in ammonia, maybe it doesn't provide a good nucleophile. Unless the ring becomes negatively charged and then NH2^- attacks.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the possible products. The question is about how many possible organic products. The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4.

If the reaction forms benzyne, then it would be a highly reactive intermediate, which can undergo various reactions, but under the given conditions, perhaps it doesn't react further and just forms the benzyne. But wait, benzyne is a diradical, so maybe it can dimerize or something, but I don't think that's part of this question.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a single product, which is the dehydrohalogenated product, like forming a triple bond. But in this case, I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible sites where elimination can happen. If the base abstracts a proton from position 6, then elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 6, leading to a benzene ring with a triple bond between 1 and 6. But wait, benzene can't have a triple bond, it's a six-membered ring. Wait, no, benzyne is a linear triple bond between two adjacent carbons in the ring. So in the case of benzyne, say between positions 1 and 2, the ring would have a triple bond there.

But in our starting material, the substituents are at 1 (Br) and 2 (D), so to form benzyne, you need two adjacent leaving groups. But only position 1 has a good leaving group (Br), and position 2 has D, which isn't. So perhaps elimination can't occur as benzyne in this case.

Wait, but another possibility: maybe the D is replaced by something else. Wait, but NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile. Unless the D is somehow a leaving group, which is unlikely. So that seems not.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where Br is replaced by NH2. But for that, the conditions need to favor nucleophilic substitution. But with a deactivating group (Br), I'm not sure. Also, in aromatic substitution, the ring usually needs to be activated towards nucleophilic substitution, which is not the case here. So that's probably not happening.

Wait, another thought: maybe the D is removed as a deuteron in an elimination reaction. But since D is a poor leaving group, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the D is unaffected, and the reaction occurs elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed at all, so the only product is the starting material. But that's not the case because the question is asking how many products are formed.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of another angle. Maybe the reaction is a di-elimination, but I don't think that's possible here. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to a carbanion adjacent to Br, which then leaves as Br^-.

But benzene rings are stable, so perhaps forming a carbanion is not favored. But under strong basic conditions, maybe it's possible.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 6. But that's not a stable structure. So perhaps it would undergo some kind of rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an elimination, but with the D being a substituent, perhaps leading to a different product. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the key point is that the D is at position 2. So when the base abstracts a proton, say from position 6, which is adjacent to Br, then the D at position 2 doesn't interfere. The elimination would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. But wait, that's not adjacent, so forming benzyne isn't possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a cycloheptatriene ring or something, but that doesn't sound right.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the number of possible products. The question options are 1, 2, 3, or 4. So maybe the reaction leads to a single product, or perhaps two different products due to different sites of elimination.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. How many possible ways can the base abstract a proton adjacent to Br? Only one site: position 6. Because position 2 has D, not H. So the base can only abstract the H at position 6. Then, elimination would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 6, but that's not adjacent. So perhaps that's not possible. Or maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Wait, am I sure about the numbering? Let's imagine the benzene ring. Position 1 is Br, position 2 is D. So the positions adjacent to Br (position 1) are 2 and 6. But position 2 has D, so the only available H is at position 6. So the base abstracts H from position 6, leading to a carbanion at position 6. Then, Br leaves as Br^-.

So, the benzene ring would lose Br and form a bond between positions 1 and 6. Wait, but that's across the ring, not adjacent. So that can't form a triple bond. Hmm, maybe that's not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a benzene ring with a triple bond between 1 and 2, but since position 2 has D, that can't happen. So maybe no elimination occurs, but that can't be right because the question says to find the number of products.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't form any product because the conditions aren't suitable. But that's not one of the options; the options include 1 as a possibility.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by the amide group from NaNH2. But that would require a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that to happen, the ring needs to be activated towards nucleophilic substitution. But Br is a deactivating group, making the ring less reactive for nucleophilic attack. So maybe this isn't feasible.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something about the reaction conditions. NaNH2 in condensed ammonia—maybe the conditions are for a specific reaction. Wait, another possibility is that the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzynelike intermediate, but with only one adjacent H available.

Wait, if only one H is adjacent to Br (position 6), then elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 6. But that's not possible because the triple bond would span two non-adjacent carbons, which isn't possible in a benzene ring. Alternatively, perhaps it forms a cyclohexene ring, but that doesn't fit with the aromaticity.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't possible, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps the only product is the formation of a single product where the Br is eliminated, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form any new product, so only the starting material is present. But the question says "how many possible organic products are there in this reaction", implying that some reaction occurs.

Wait, maybe the reaction forms a single product via elimination. But I'm not sure what that product would be. Alternatively, perhaps no reaction occurs, so the number of products is one—the starting material. But the question doesn't specify whether the reaction goes to completion or whether it's just a possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts the deuterium instead of a hydrogen. But D is a poor leaving group, so that's unlikely. But if it did, then elimination would involve D and Br, leading to something. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the NH2^- attacks the benzene ring. But as I thought earlier, the ring isn't activated for that. So that's probably not happening.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation forming a vinylic carbanion, which then could abstract a proton elsewhere. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, maybe the reaction forms a benzylide anion. So the base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, leading to a carbanion next to Br, which then eliminates Br^- to form a triple bond. But wait, in benzene, eliminating Br from position 1 and H from position 6 would form a triple bond between 1 and 6, which isn't possible because they're not adjacent. So perhaps this isn't feasible.

Hmm, perhaps I'm going in circles here. Let me think of another angle. What if the reaction leads to the substitution of Br with something else? But as I thought earlier, that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe the D is a deuterium and doesn't affect the reaction. So the reaction is similar to 1-bromobenzene treated with NaNH2. In that case, what's the product? Well, 1-bromobenzene treated with NaNH2 would undergo dehydrohalogenation to form benzyne. But benzyne is a diradical, highly reactive, and can dimerize or react further.

Wait, but in this problem, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So the positions are fixed with Br at 1, D at 2. So if the base abstracts the H from position 6, then elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 6, but that's not possible because they're opposite each other in the benzene ring. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form benzyne because there's only one H available for elimination. So perhaps no reaction occurs, leading to only the starting material as the product. But that would mean only one product, which is option B.

Wait, but the question is asking about the number of products, so if only the starting material is present, the answer would be 1. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction forms a single product via elimination, but I'm not seeing it. Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, but the question implies that a reaction occurs.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by something else. But under the given conditions, substitution doesn't seem likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is irrelevant, and the reaction is the same as for 1-bromobenzene. In that case, the product would be benzyne. But benzyne isn't an isolated product; it's an intermediate. So maybe the question is considering the possibility of multiple products due to different sites of elimination.

Wait, but in the case of 1-bromo-2-d benzene, there's only one available H adjacent to Br, so elimination occurs only once, leading to a single product. But wait, benzyne can form in different positions, but in this case, there's only one possible position for elimination.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should consider that the reaction doesn't proceed because the base can't abstract any H adjacent to Br. So the only product is the starting material, making option B (1 product) the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction does proceed, leading to two possible products if elimination can occur in different positions. But in this case, there's only one H adjacent to Br (position 6), so only one product would form.

Wait, but maybe when the base abstracts the H, the Br leaves, forming a diradical that could form a triple bond between positions 1 and 6, but that's not possible. So perhaps no reaction occurs, leading to only one product (the starting material).

But I'm not entirely confident. Another way to think about this is to recall that NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base and can abstract protons alpha to the leaving group. So in this case, the H at position 6 is alpha to Br. So elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 6, but that's not possible in a benzene ring, so maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, and the only product is the starting material.

So the number of products is 1. So the answer would be option B) 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d (a benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2) with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base, often used for dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. However, the starting material has specific substituents: bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2. 

Bromine is a good leaving group, but deuterium is not. For elimination to occur, a proton adjacent to bromine must be abstracted by the base. In this case, the only available proton adjacent to bromine is at position 6. When NaNH₂ abstracts this proton, bromine leaves as Br⁻, and a triple bond (benzyne intermediate) could theoretically form between positions 1 and 6. However, this is not feasible because a triple bond cannot span non-adjacent carbons in a benzene ring. Thus, elimination does not lead to a stable product.

Other possibilities, such as nucleophilic aromatic substitution, are unlikely because bromine is a deactivating group, making the ring unreactive toward nucleophilic substitution under these conditions. Similarly, the deuterium at position 2 does not act as a leaving group and does not interfere with the reaction. Therefore, no reaction occurs, and the starting material remains unchanged.

Since no reaction proceeds under the given conditions, the only product is the starting material itself. Thus, there is only one possible organic product.

Answer: B
