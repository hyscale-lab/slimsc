Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember from my studies that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And when they decay, they don't travel very far because they're unstable. The question is asking for the mean decay distance of this meson X.

The given values are E_X = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV, and Γ_X = 320 MeV. Wait, units are important here. I should probably convert everything to the same unit system. Since the decay length is in meters, I think I'll need to use SI units.

First, I think I need to find the lifetime of the meson. The mean lifetime (τ) is related to the width Γ by the uncertainty principle. I remember that Γ is the total decay width, and the relation is τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is in GeV, so I need to convert it into seconds to get τ in seconds.

Wait, let me double-check the formula. Oh right, the natural line width formula says that Γ is the total decay width, which is the energy uncertainty. The uncertainty in time is the lifetime, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. I think when dealing with particle physics, it's τ = ħ / Γ, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, sometimes I've seen τ = 1/(Γ/ħ), which would make sense because units have to work out.

So, Γ is given as 320 MeV. Let me convert that to GeV to match E_X. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. Now, I need to calculate ħ in GeV·s. I remember that Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So, τ = ħ / Γ. Let me plug in the numbers.

Γ is 0.32 GeV, so τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ let's see, 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 20.56875e-25, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Hmm, okay.

Now that I have the lifetime, I need to find the mean decay distance. Decay distance is the product of the velocity (v) of the particle and the lifetime (τ). So, distance L = v * τ.

But wait, what's the velocity of the meson? Since it's produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV, I can find its velocity using relativistic equations. The rest mass m_X is 1.2 GeV. So, the energy E is related to the rest mass by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². I can rearrange this to find the momentum p, and then find the velocity from p and m.

Wait, let's compute the momentum first. E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV. So,

E² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2
(8)^2 = (p c)^2 + (1.2)^2
64 = p² c² + 1.44
So, p² c² = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56
Then, p c = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV

But wait, I think the units are getting a bit tricky. Let me write it properly. So,

p² c² = E² - m² c^4 → but I'm using units where c=1, so E in GeV, m in GeV, so p would be in GeV/c?

Wait, actually, in natural units where c=1, the equation is E² = p² + m². So,

p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(8^2 - 1.2^2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV/c.

So, p = 7.91 GeV/c. Now, the momentum p is also related to velocity v via p = gamma m v, but perhaps it's easier to find beta (v/c) from the energy.

Alternatively, beta = v/c = p c / E → since p c is 7.91 GeV, and E is 8 GeV.

So beta = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) = 7.91 /8 ≈ 0.98875.

So v = beta c ≈ 0.98875 * c.

Now, putting it all together. The mean lifetime τ is 2.056875e-24 seconds. The velocity v is approximately 0.98875 * c, where c is about 3e8 m/s.

So, L = v * τ ≈ (0.98875 * 3e8 m/s) * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute that. First, 0.98875 *3e8 = approx 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s:

2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

Compute 2.966 *2.056875.

Let me calculate that:

2.966 * 2 =5.932
2.966 *0.056875 ≈ 0.168 (since 0.05 *2.966=0.1483, 0.006875 *2.966≈0.02036 → total ~0.1686)
So total is approx 5.932 +0.1686 =6.0996.

So 6.1e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are in the 10^-15 or 10^-16 m range. So 6e-16 is about 6.1e-16 m. But none of the options exactly match that. Let me check each option.

Options are:

A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m

B)4.0655 *10^-15 m

C)5.0223 *10^-15 m

D)4.0655 *10^-16 m

Hmm. So my calculation got approximately 6.1e-16 m. But none of the options are near 6e-16. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

First, calculating Γ:

Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So tau is ħ / (Γ) = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 6.582e-25 /0.32.

Wait, 6.582e-25 / 0.32: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. That seems correct.

Then, beta was calculated as (p c)/E. p c is sqrt(64-1.44), which is sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV. E is 8 GeV. So 7.91/8=0.98875. Correct.

So v=0.98875 c, which is about 0.98875 *3e8 m/s = approx 2.966e8 m/s.

Then, L = v * τ: 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, 2.966e8 is 2.966 *1e8. 2.056875e-24 is 2.056875 *1e-24.

Multiplying 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 *2.056875) * 1e8 -24 = 6.1e-16. Hmm, so 6.1e-16 m.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: 5.0223e-16, but that's lower. Did I make a mistake in calculations?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for τ. Maybe the correct formula is τ = ħ / (Γ/2) ? Because sometimes the width is Γ, and the uncertainty is Γ/2. Wait, I think in some contexts, Γ is the full width, and the lifetime is given by τ = ħ/(Γ/2). Because the uncertainty principle says ΔE Δt ≈ ħ, but if Γ is the full width, then ΔE is about Γ, and Δt is τ, so Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but some sources say that the natural line width formula uses Γ as the total width, so τ = ħ / Γ. So I did that right.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the velocity. Let me check that again.

E = 8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(64 -1.44) = sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV/c.

Then beta = (p c)/(E) = (7.91 *c )/(8 c) )= 7.91/8 =0.98875. So beta is correct. So v is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately the product of 2.966e8 and 2.056875e-24.

Let me compute 2.966 *2.056875.

2.056875 is approximately 2.056875.

2.966 * 2 = 5.932

2.966 * 0.056875 = let's calculate:

0.05 *2.966 = 0.1483.

0.006875 *2.966 = 0.02036.

So total is 0.1483 + 0.02036 = 0.16866.

So sum is 5.932 +0.16866 =6.10066.

So 6.10066e-16 m.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. Let's think again. Could I have made a mistake in the calculation of p, or beta?

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute beta as (pc)/(E). Which I did, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider relativistic gamma. Wait, no, decay length is about the velocity multiplied by lifetime, which I think is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma (γ) the Lorentz factor. Because the lifetime in the lab frame is τ = gamma * τ_0, where τ_0 is the proper lifetime (the lifetime at rest). Wait, no, the lifetime τ is the lifetime in the lab frame. Because when a particle is moving, its lifetime is longer due to time dilation. So the lab frame lifetime is τ = gamma * tau_rest.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Because when you calculate the decay length, you have to consider that the particle's lifetime is extended by gamma factor.

Wait, so the proper lifetime (tau_0) is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. Then, in the lab frame, the lifetime is tau = gamma * tau_0.

But earlier, I used tau = ħ / Γ, which is in the rest frame. So perhaps I should calculate tau_0 = ħ / (Γ), and then in the lab frame, tau = gamma * tau_0.

Ah, that's a critical point. Maybe I missed the gamma factor.

So, steps again:

1. Compute tau_0 = ħ / Γ. This is the proper lifetime (rest frame).

2. Compute gamma = E/(m c^2). Since in natural units, E = gamma m. So gamma = E/(m c^2) → but since we're using units where c=1, E = gamma m.

Wait, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... ≈ 6.6667.

So the lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma * tau_0.

So tau_0 = ħ / Gamma =6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

Then tau_lab = gamma * tau_0 =6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ 1.371e-23 s.

Wait, that's a factor of about 6.6667 longer than what I had before. So earlier I used tau_lab = tau_0, but in reality, I should have multiplied by gamma. So that's a mistake. The decay length would be much larger because tau_lab is longer.

So now, let's compute correctly.

Tau_lab = gamma * tau_0 = (8/1.2) * (6.582e-25 / 0.32) GeV·s / GeV

Wait, 8 /1.2 is 2.666... Wait, no, 8/(1.2) is 6.666... Oh right, 8 divided by 1.2 is (80/12)=20/3≈6.6667.

So,

tau_0 = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 2.056875e-24 s.

tau_lab = 6.6667 *2.056875e-24 = 1.371e-23 s.

Now, compute v. Beta is 0.98875, so v = beta c = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.96625e8 m/s.

Then, the decay length L = v * tau_lab.

So L = 2.96625e8 m/s *1.371e-23 s.

Calculating 2.96625e8 *1.371e-23 = (2.96625 *1.371) * 1e-15.

Multiply 2.96625 *1.371:

Approx:

2.96625 *1 = 2.96625

2.96625 * 0.371 = Let's compute:

0.3 *2.96625 = 0.889875

0.07 *2.96625 = 0.2076375

0.001 *2.96625=0.00296625

Adding these: 0.889875 +0.2076375=1.0975125 +0.00296625=1.10047875.

So total is 2.96625 +1.10047875 =4.06672875.

So 4.06672875e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close to this. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me make sure about the gamma factor. So the lifetime in the lab frame is longer by gamma, which we accounted for, right? So L = v * gamma tau_0.

Yes, so the calculation now gives 4.0667e-15 m, which matches option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we start with the given parameters: production energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), and decay width \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). The decay distance \( L \) is calculated using the formula:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau
\]

where \( v \) is the velocity of the meson and \( \tau \) is its mean lifetime in the lab frame. The steps to compute \( L \) are as follows:

---

### 1. **Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \):**
The proper lifetime (in the rest frame) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

---

### 2. **Relate the lab-frame lifetime \( \tau \) to \( \tau_0 \):**
The lab-frame lifetime is extended due to time dilation, and is given by:

\[
\tau = \gamma \cdot \tau_0
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor. For a particle with energy \( E \) and mass \( m \), \( \gamma \) is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m}
\]

Substituting \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

Thus, the lab-frame lifetime is:

\[
\tau = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.371 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

---

### 3. **Calculate the velocity \( v \):**
The velocity \( v \) is determined using the relativistic relation:

\[
\beta = \frac{p c}{E}, \quad v = \beta c
\]

First, compute the momentum \( p \) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:

\[
E^2 = p^2 + m^2 \implies p = \sqrt{E^2 - m^2}
\]

Substituting \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
p = \sqrt{8^2 - 1.2^2} = \sqrt{64 - 1.44} = \sqrt{62.56} \approx 7.91 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Now, calculate \( \beta \):

\[
\beta = \frac{p}{E} = \frac{7.91}{8} \approx 0.98875
\]

Thus, the velocity is:

\[
v = \beta c = 0.98875 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

---

### 4. **Calculate the decay distance \( L \):**
The decay distance is:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau
\]

Substituting \( v \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( \tau \approx 1.371 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.371 \times 10^{-23}) \approx 4.0667 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

---

### 5. **Compare with the options:**
The calculated decay distance \( L \approx 4.0667 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) matches closely with option **B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

---

**Answer: B**
