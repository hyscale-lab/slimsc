Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titrations have always been a little tricky for me. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. They're asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each with two pH values.

First, let's read the problem again carefully. 

We start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 mL. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. 

The two parts we need to find are the pH at 25% titration and the pH at the equivalence point.

Let me break it down into parts.

Part 1: Calculating the concentration after dilution.

Original volume of acetic acid (CH3COOH) is 20 mL, concentration 0.05 M. When we add 20 mL water, the volume doubles. So the new concentration can be found using M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 = 0.05 M, V1 = 20 mL. V2 = 40 mL. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, because I'm adding equal volumes, the concentration becomes half. 0.05/2 is 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Part 2: Titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about 25% titration and the equivalence point.

First, I think I need to find out the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. Then, figure out how much NaOH is added at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

Molarity times volume gives moles. The diluted solution is 40 mL, which is 0.04 L. So moles of CH3COOH are 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

When titrated with NaOH, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. So the mole ratio is 1:1.

So at equivalence point, moles of NaOH added would be 0.001 mol. 

But wait, the NaOH solution is 0.1 M. So the volume needed to reach equivalence point is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 mL. 

So the equivalence point is when 10 mL of NaOH is added.

Now, the question is about the pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume. 25% of 10 mL is 2.5 mL. So at 25% titration, 2.5 mL of NaOH is added.

I think at 25% titration, only 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the moles of NaOH added are 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol. 

Wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's 25% of the total NaOH required. Since the equivalence point requires 10 mL, 25% is 2.5 mL. So moles of NaOH added is 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. That's correct.

So, in the solution at 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate.

Let me denote:

Initial moles acetic acid: 0.001 mol.

Moles NaOH added: 0.00025 mol.

This will react with acetic acid:

CH3COOH + OH^- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So moles CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles acetate (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume at 25% titration is the initial 40 mL plus 2.5 mL NaOH added. So total volume is 42.5 mL (0.0425 L). 

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, since acetic acid is a weak acid and its conjugate base (acetate) is present, this is a buffer solution. So we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5.

Calculating pKa: 

log(1.85e-5) is around log(1.85) + log(1e-5) ≈ 0.267 + (-5) → -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Now, the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333. 

log(0.3333) is about -0.477. 

So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.256. Hmm, so around 4.26. 

Looking at the options, option A) is 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Others don't match.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, when I calculate [A^-]/[HA], I need to make sure I'm using the correct concentrations. Let me double-check.

Wait, moles of CH3COOH is 0.00075, moles A^- is 0.00025. So the ratio is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So log(1/3) is approximately -0.477.

Yes, that part's correct. So pH is about 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. Rounded to two decimal places, that's 4.26. So the first pH value is 4.26.

Now, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH), so the solution will be basic.

At equivalence point, the moles of acetate ions are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid. So 0.001 mol of CH3COO^-.

The total volume is 40 mL (original solution) plus 10 mL (NaOH added) = 50 mL or 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid. In solution, it will hydrolyze according to:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Since Ka is 1.85e-5, Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression for Kb.

Let x be the concentration of OH^- produced.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ x² / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) → approximately 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 3.288e-6 M. Then pOH = -log([OH^-]).

log(3.288e-6) is log(3.288) + log(1e-6). Log(3.288) is about 0.517, so pOH ≈ 5.483.

pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517. So approximately 8.52.

So the second pH value is 8.52.

Looking back at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52 as the two pH values. So that should be the correct option.

Wait, but let me check if I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, when I calculated the pH at 25% titration, I considered the total volume as 42.5 mL. Is that correct?

Yes. The initial solution is 40 mL, and 2.5 mL of NaOH is added, so 42.5 mL.

Another possible mistake could be in the calculation of Kb. Let me check that.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa ≈ 4.733. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10. Yes, correct.

Then, for acetate concentration 0.02 M:

Kb = x² / 0.02 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) → 3.288e-6. Yes.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288)=0.517, so log(3.288e-6)=5.483 → pOH=5.483 → pH=8.517. Rounded to two decimal places is 8.52. So that's correct.

So the two pH values are 4.26 and 8.52. Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52, so option A is correct.

To solve the problem, we start by determining the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L) with a concentration of 0.05 M. Adding 20.00 cm³ of water doubles the total volume to 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \times 0.02}{0.04} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = M \times V = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.04 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

When titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is reached when all the acetic acid is neutralized. Since the reaction is 1:1, the moles of NaOH required are equal to the moles of acetic acid:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point is:

\[
V_{\text{NaOH}} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{M_{\text{NaOH}}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{mL}.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume (2.5 mL of NaOH) is added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ions (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume at 25% titration is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40.00 \, \text{mL} + 2.5 \, \text{mL} = 42.50 \, \text{mL} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \( K_a = 1.85 \times 10^{-5} \) and \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(K_a) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate ions. The moles of acetate are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40.00 \, \text{mL} + 10 \, \text{mL} = 50.00 \, \text{mL} = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \). Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( \text{OH}^- \) formed. Then:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x} \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x^2 = K_b \times 0.02 = 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \times 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}, \quad x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log([OH^-]) = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.483 = 8.517 \approx 8.52.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
