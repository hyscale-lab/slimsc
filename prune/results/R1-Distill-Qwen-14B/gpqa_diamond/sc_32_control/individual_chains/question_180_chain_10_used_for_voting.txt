Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, and their mass is negligible. So, we're dealing with charges here, probably involving electric potential energy. 

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, in Joules. The options are given as A, B, C, D with different values.

Hmm. So, the setup is that there's a central charge at P, and 12 others arranged around it, each at a distance of 2 meters from P. Since all charges are identical, they're all 2e each, right?

Wait, but how are these 12 charges arranged? Are they all at the same distance from P, each 2 meters away? Yes, the problem says 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So, maybe they form a spherical shell or something around P, but the exact arrangement (like exact positions) might not matter for the potential energy calculation because each contributes similarly.

The question is about the minimum energy of the system. So, I'm thinking about the electric potential energy in a system of charges. For a system of point charges, the potential energy can be calculated by considering each pair of charges and summing up their contributions.

But wait, the system is isolated. So, perhaps we're to calculate the total potential energy of the system due to all the charges.

Let me remember the formula for electric potential energy between two point charges. The potential energy U between two charges q1 and q2 separated by distance r is given by Coulomb's law: U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C² or 1/(4πε₀).

So, in this problem, the system consists of 13 charges. Each charge is 2e. Let me note e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2e = 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

But wait, the system is made up of these 13 charges: 12 are at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is fixed at P.

Wait, so the 13th charge is at P, so each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from P. So, each of the 12 charges is at distance 2m from the 13th charge. What about the distances between the 12 charges themselves? The problem says they are each at 2m from P, but it doesn't specify their arrangement relative to each other. Since the problem is asking for the minimum energy, perhaps the arrangement that minimizes the potential energy would be the one where the charges are as close as possible to each other, but the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So, their mutual distances would depend on their positions, but since they're all the same distance from P, maybe they lie on a sphere of radius 2m around P, but the exact positions could vary. However, the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves would depend on their distances, but perhaps the problem is making the assumption that the energy is only due to the charges being at 2 meters from P, meaning that we don't need to consider the interactions between the 12 charges, or perhaps that those interactions are negligible, or arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy is zero? Hmm, that doesn't make much sense. Wait, no, the problem is about calculating the minimum energy, so maybe the minimal potential energy is achieved when the 12 charges are as close as possible. But without specific constraints on their relative positions, perhaps we have to assume that the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that the potential energy between them is zero. Or maybe it's a trick question where only the interactions between the 12 and the 13th charge are considered.

Wait, another thought: the minimum potential energy of the system might be when the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges are minimized. But if all 12 charges are positive, their mutual repulsion would make them want to be as far apart as possible, which would maximize the potential energy. But since we're looking for the minimum, perhaps the problem assumes that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual repulsion is considered, but perhaps the problem is only considering the interactions between the 13th charge and the 12 others, ignoring the interactions between the 12 themselves. That would make the calculation simpler, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, the problem says "the minimum energy of this system." So, perhaps the minimum is achieved when all other interactions except those involving the central charge are zero. But that would only be the case if the mutual interactions are zero, which they're not. Because all the 12 charges are identical and positive, so they would repel each other. So their potential energy would be positive because it's a system of positive charges repelling each other. But the question is about the minimum energy. Hmm, but if the system is isolated, then perhaps the potential energy can't be lowered beyond a certain point, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy only between the central charge and the 12 others, not considering the interactions between the 12 themselves. Because the problem states that each of the 12 is constrained to stay at 2m from P. So maybe the positions are fixed, and the mutual potential energies between the 12 are not considered. Or perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energies are zero, but that doesn't make sense.

Let me think. The potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So, for each pair, calculate U and sum them all.

So, the system has:

- The central charge (charge q0 = 2e) and each of the 12 charges (q_i = 2e), each at distance r = 2m.

- Then, each pair among the 12 charges is at some distance d from each other. But since each of the 12 is at 2m from P, the distance between any two of them could vary, but perhaps in the minimal energy case, we can arrange them as close as possible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the mutual interactions between the 12 charges. Because considering them would complicate things, and the problem gives a specific setup.

Wait, but the problem says it's an isolated system, so the energy would include all interactions. But given that, perhaps the problem is simplifying the scenario by only considering the interactions between the central charge and the 12 others, and not between the 12 themselves. Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is considered, but I'm not sure how.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are such that the potential energy is minimized. But I'm not certain how that would work. Maybe if they are all at the same point, but that's not possible due to their mutual repulsion. Wait, but if they're constrained to stay 2m from P, but not from each other, perhaps their mutual distances are determined by their positions on a sphere of radius 2m. So, perhaps the minimal potential energy is when the 12 charges are arranged as close as possible on the sphere, but that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 others, ignoring the 12's mutual interactions. Because in that case, the calculation becomes simpler. Let's assume that for now.

So, the total potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between q0 and each of the 12 charges.

Each of the 12 charges is at distance r = 2m from q0.

Each pair (q0, qi) contributes U = k * q0 * qi / r.

Since q0 = qi = 2e, each pair contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = k*(4e²)/(2m) = (2k e²)/m.

But wait, wait. Let me recheck that:

Each pair is between q0 and qi. So, U_i = k*(2e)*(2e) / (2) = k * (4e²) / 2 = 2k e².

Wait, no, because r is 2 meters. So the denominator is 2, not m. So each U_i is (k * (2e)^2) / 2.

Wait, let me compute that correctly. Each of the 12 charges contributes U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / 2m. Wait, no. Because r is 2 meters. So U_i is k * (2e) * (2e) / (2) = k*(4 e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

But wait, 12 such charges, so the total U is 12 times that.

So U_total = 12 * (2 k e²) = 24 k e².

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy with the central charge. So yes, 12 terms each of (k * q0 * qi) / r.

But let me compute this step by step.

Each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from P, so the distance is r = 2 m.

Each charge is 2e, so the product is (2e)*(2e) = 4 e².

So each U_i = k * (4 e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

Multiply by 12: 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Another way: the potential energy of each pair is U = k q1 q2 / r.

So for each pair (q0 and qi), q0 is 2e, qi is 2e, r is 2 m.

So U_i = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2) = k*(4e²)/(2) = 2 k e².

So for 12 such pairs, it's 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Hmm. So the total potential energy would be that.

But wait, what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Since they are all the same charge, each pair among them contributes positive potential energy. So the total potential energy would be the sum of the central's contributions and the 12 charges' mutual contributions.

But, the problem says the system is isolated and asks for the minimum energy. So perhaps it's only considering the central charge's interactions, and the mutual interactions of the 12 are considered to be zero. But I don't think that's correct because in reality, all pairs would contribute.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge's interactions and nothing else. Let me think.

Wait, the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from point P. So, perhaps their positions are fixed relative to P, but their mutual distances could vary. However, the problem is looking for the minimum energy, which likely occurs when the mutual potential energy is minimized. But for identical positive charges, the mutual potential energy is minimized when they are as close as possible to each other. But they're constrained to stay on a sphere of radius 2m, so the closest they can get is when they are as close as possible on the sphere's surface.

Wait, but arranging 12 identical charges on a sphere to minimize the sum of their mutual potential energies... Hmm, that's probably a very complex problem. For the sake of this problem, perhaps the mutual interactions are being neglected, and only the central charge's interactions are considered. Because otherwise, the problem becomes complicated, which might not be intended for a multiple-choice question.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is considering the energy between all pairs.

So, perhaps the system's potential energy is the sum of all possible pairs.

So the total number of pairs would be:

- Between q0 and each of the 12 charges: 12 pairs.

- Between each pair of the 12 charges: C(12,2) = 66 pairs.

So, the total potential energy would be U = sum of all these.

So, first calculate U0, the energy from the central charge and the 12 charges.

Then compute U12, the energy from the 12 charges themselves.

But without knowing the distances between the 12 charges, it's impossible to calculate U12, unless the problem makes some assumption. Alternatively, perhaps each of the 12 charges is at the same distance from each other, but that's not the case because they can be arranged anywhere on the sphere of radius 2m.

Wait, but for an isolated system, the potential energy is the sum of all pairs. So, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate only U0 (the central charge's interactions) and not U12. Because otherwise, the problem doesn't provide enough information.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged such that they're all at the same distance from each other. But how? For a sphere with 12 points, arranging them equidistantly is not possible except for specific numbers, like the vertices of a regular polyhedron. But 12 isn't one of the regular ones. So perhaps the problem is only considering U0 and not U12.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are all 2 meters as well. But that would require them to be arranged on a regular dodecahedron or something, but that's perhaps beyond this problem's scope.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their distance from the central charge is fixed, but their mutual distances can vary. So, the way to find the minimum energy would be to arrange the 12 charges in a way that minimizes the sum of their mutual potential energies. Since all charges are positive, their mutual potential energy is positive, so to minimize the total energy, we need to arrange them as close as possible to each other. But how close can they get given the constraint of being on a sphere of radius 2m around P?

Hmm, perhaps the minimal mutual potential energy is zero, but that's not possible because they're all same sign. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are all the same, but without more information, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to ignore the mutual interactions between the 12 charges and only consider the potential energy between each qi and q0. That would make the calculation manageable.

So, let's proceed under that assumption, even though I'm not entirely confident. The problem might not require considering the mutual interactions between the 12 charges, perhaps because the mutual potential energies are zero (unlikely) or because they cancel out, but that seems unlikely.

So, the total potential energy is only the sum of the interactions between the central charge and the 12 charges.

So, each of the 12 charges contributes U_i = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) as computed earlier.

Wait, wait. Let me correct that. The formula is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r.

Each q is 2e, so q1*q2 = (2e)^2 =4 e².

r is 2 meters.

So, each U_i = k * 4 e² / 2 = 2 k e².

Multiply by 12: 12 * 2 k e² =24 k e².

So, U_total = 24 * k * e².

Now, plug in the numbers.

Constants:

k = 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C²

e = 1.602 x 10^-19 C

So, e² = (1.602e-19)^2 ≈ 2.566e-38 C².

Compute 24 * k * e²:

24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

8.988e9 = 8.988 x 10^9

2.566e-38 = 2.566 x 10^-38

Multiply them together: 8.988 * 2.566 ≈ let's compute that.

8 * 2.566 = 20.528

0.988 * 2.566 ≈ approx 2.536 (because 1 * 2.566 is 2.566, subtract 0.012 *2.566≈0.0308, so 2.566-0.0308≈2.535).

So 8.988 * 2.566 ≈ 20.528 +2.535 ≈ 23.063.

Now, 10^9 * 10^-38 = 10^-29.

So, 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 ≈ 23.063e-29.

Now multiply by 24:

24 * 23.063e-29 = (24 *23.063) e-29.

24 *23.063 = 23.063 *24.

20 *24=480, 3.063*24≈73.512. So total ≈480 +73.512=553.512.

So, 553.512e-29 J.

Wait, but 553.512e-29 J is 5.53512e-27 J.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, and B is 2.822e-26.

Hmm. So 5.5e-27 is close to option C, but let me check the calculation again because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exponents.

Wait, let me compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38:

8.988e9 = 8.988 * 1e9.

2.566e-38 = 2.566 * 1e-38.

Multiply: 8.988 * 2.566 = approximately 23.063, as before.

1e9 * 1e-38 = 1e-29.

So, 23.063e-29.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 23.063e-29 = 553.512e-29 = 5.53512e-27 J.

So approximately 5.535e-27 J.

Looking at the options:

A) 5.645e-26

B) 2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330

Hmm, our calculation is about 5.535e-27 J, which is closest to option C (7.056e-27), but not quite. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Let me recheck.

Wait, each of the 12 charges interacts with the central charge once. So 12 interactions. So, yes, 12 times 2k e², which is 24 k e².

Wait, wait, no: wait, each charge is 2e, so the product is (2e)(2e) =4 e². So each term is (k * 4 e²) / 2m. Wait, wait, no. Because r is 2 meters, so each term is (k * (2e)^2) / 2.

Wait, 2e multiplied by 2e is 4 e². Divided by 2 meters, so each term is (k *4e²) / (2) = 2 k e².

Yes, that's correct. So each of the 12 contributes 2 k e², so total is 24 k e².

So why is the calculation giving me 5.5e-27 J, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of k. Let me check Coulomb's constant.

k = 1/(4πε₀) ≈ 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the calculation steps.

Wait, let me compute 24 * k * e².

Compute step by step:

e = 1.602176634e-19 C.

e squared = (1.602176634e-19)^2 = approx 2.56696985e-38 C².

k = 8.9875517879e9 N·m²/C².

Compute 24 * k * e².

= 24 * 8.9875517879e9 * 2.56696985e-38.

Let me compute 8.98755e9 * 2.56697e-38 first.

8.98755e9 = 8.98755 * 1e9.

2.56697e-38 = 2.56697 * 1e-38.

Multiply 8.98755 * 2.56697 ≈ let's compute:

8 * 2.56697 = 20.5358

0.98755 * 2.56697 ≈ let's compute:

0.9 * 2.56697 ≈ 2.310273

0.08755 * 2.56697 ≈ approx 0.2247.

Adding together: 2.310273 + 0.2247 ≈ 2.53497.

So total is 20.5358 +2.53497 ≈ 23.0708.

So, 8.98755e9 * 2.56697e-38 = 23.0708e (9-38) = 23.0708e-29 = 2.30708e-28.

Wait, wait, 1e9 * 1e-38 = 1e-29. So, 8.98755e9 * 2.56697e-38 = 23.0708e-29 = 2.30708e-28? No, wait, 23.0708e-29 is 2.30708e-28? No, 23.0708e-29 is equal to 2.30708e-28? Wait, no. Because 23e-29 is 2.3e-28. So 23.0708e-29 = 2.30708e-28.

Wait, no. Because 23e-29 = 2.3e-28.

Wait, 23e-29 = 2.3e-28? No. 23e-29 = 2.3e-28? Because 2.3e-28 is 23e-29. Yes.

So 23.0708e-29 = 2.30708e-28.

Now multiply by 24:

24 * 2.30708e-28 = 55.370e-28 = 5.5370e-27 J.

Hmm, that's approximately 5.537e-27 J.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is 7.056e-27.

Option B is 2.822e-26.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I forgot to account for something. Let me think. Did I miscalculate the number of interactions?

Wait, wait, wait a second. No, the central charge is fixed, and each of the 12 charges interacts with it once, so 12 terms. So, that's correct.

Wait, but what if the problem is considering the potential energy of the entire system, which would include all possible pairs, including the 12 charges among themselves. But without knowing their mutual distances, it's impossible to compute that.

Wait, but perhaps the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is zero, but that only happens if all the charges are at the same point, which isn't the case here. Because when they're spread out, their mutual potential energy is positive. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is zero, but that's not possible with positive charges.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is designed so that the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges are all zero, but that's not feasible unless they're all at the same point, which contradicts their being constrained at 2m from P.

So, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 others, which gives us 5.537e-27 J. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, maybe the central charge is fixed, so when considering the potential energy of the system, we don't include the interactions between the 12 charges. But the problem says that the system's minimum energy is required. So perhaps the mutual interactions are negligible, or perhaps the problem is considering only the energy between the 12 and the central charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's setup is that the 12 charges are fixed at 2m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P, so the only movement is of the 13th charge. But no, the central charge is fixed, so the only charges moving are the 12, but their positions are constrained. So, the potential energy is fixed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12 charges, but not the 12's mutual interactions. Therefore, the calculation I did earlier is correct, but the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me compute 24 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, wait, another approach: compute each term correctly.

Each U_i = k * (2e)^2 / 2.

So for each of the 12 charges, U_i = (8.988e9) * ( (2 * 1.602e-19)^2 ) / 2.

Compute (2*1.602e-19)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 = approx 1.026e-37 C².

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 1.026e-37 = 9.24e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.62e-28.

Each U_i is 4.62e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 12 * 4.62e-28 = 5.544e-27 J.

So, approximately 5.54e-27 J.

But none of the options match this. The options are:

A) 5.645e-26

B) 2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330

Hmm, 5.54e-27 is close to option C, which is 7.056e-27, but it's about 27% higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of charges. Wait, the problem says 13 identical particles. 12 are at 2m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P.

Wait, in Coulomb's law, the potential energy between two charges q1 and q2 is k q1 q2 / r.

But when considering multiple charges, the potential energy is the sum of all pairs. So, for each of the 12 charges, you have U_i = k q0 qi / r.

Wait, but in the case of multiple charges contributing to the potential at a point, the potential energy is calculated as the work done to bring each charge from infinity to its position.

Wait, perhaps the correct way to calculate the potential energy of the system is to consider the work done in assembling all the charges.

So, for the central charge q0, you bring it from infinity to point P, which requires zero work because it's the first charge. Then, for each of the other 12 charges qi, you bring them from infinity to their positions at 2m from P. Each qi will experience the electric field due to q0, so the work done in bringing each qi is (k q0 qi) / r.

So the total work done (which is the potential energy) is the sum over all 12 charges of (k q0 qi) / r.

Which is what I calculated earlier: 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) = 12 * (k *4 e²)/(2) = 12 * 2 k e² =24 k e².

Which I calculated to be approximately 5.54e-27 J.

But the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the potential energy is calculated as (1/2) * sum of all pairwise terms, because each pair is counted twice in the sum.

Wait, wait, that's a common mistake. Let me think. The formula for the potential energy of a system of charges is U = (1/2) Σ (k q_i q_j / r_ij), where the sum is over all i < j.

But in our earlier approach, when considering the central charge and the 12 charges, each of the 12 charges interacts only once with the central charge, so that's 12 terms, each of k q0 qi / r.

So I think that approach is correct.

But perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between the 12 charges as well, and I completely missed that part.

Wait, but without knowing the distances between the 12 charges, I can't compute that. So perhaps the problem expects us to ignore that part.

But then, the calculated value isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the value accurately.

Compute U = 24 * k * e².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

So, 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 first.

8.988e9 = 8.988 * 1e9.

2.566e-38 = 2.566 * 1e-38.

Multiply the coefficients: 8.988 * 2.566 ≈ let's compute exactly.

8 * 2.566 = 20.528.

0.988 * 2.566 ≈ 0.988 *2 =1.976, 0.988 *0.566≈0.560. So total ≈ 1.976 +0.560=2.536.

So total ≈ 20.528 + 2.536=23.064.

So 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 23.064e(9-38) =23.064e-29 = 2.3064e-28.

Now multiply by 24:

2.3064e-28 *24 =55.3536e-28 =5.53536e-27 J.

Which is approximately 5.535e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:7.056e-27, but that's about 27% higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the number of terms.

Wait, perhaps the central charge is 2e, and each of the 12 charges is 2e, so the product for each pair is (2e)(2e)=4e².

But perhaps I should have considered (2e)(2e) for each of the 12 charges, which is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy between the 12 charges and the central charge, but each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the central charge. Also, each charge is at the same distance from each other, meaning that the distance between any two of the 12 charges is 2 meters as well. But that's not possible because they are on a sphere of radius 2 meters. The distance between two points on the sphere's surface would be 2 * 2 sin(theta/2), where theta is the angle between them. So, it's only possible if they are antipodal, but arranging 12 points on a sphere for all mutual distances to be 2 meters would require a specific configuration, which is not possible unless the sphere is large enough, but in this case, the radius is 2 meters. Wait, perhaps the mutual distances are 2 meters as well, but that would require that the arrangement is such that the distance between any two charges is 2 meters. That's only possible if all 12 charges are arranged in a regular icosahedron or something, but the mutual distance would not all be the same unless the sphere's circumference allows it. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are considered to be 2 meters, but that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances are zero, meaning they are all at the same point, which would make their mutual potential energy very high. But that's not the case, because they're constrained to be 2m from P.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The calculation I did gives 5.535e-27 J, but that's not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between all pairs, including the central charge and each of the 12, and the mutual pairs between the 12. So U_total = U_central + U_mutual.

But without knowing the mutual distances, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual distances are 2 meters as well. So each mutual pair contributes (k * (2e)^2)/(2) = same as the central charge's contribution.

So, for the mutual pairs: there are 12 charges, so the number of mutual pairs is C(12, 2) =66.

Each mutual pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2) = same as the central charge's term.

So, each mutual pair contributes 2 k e².

So, U_mutual =66 * 2 k e²=132 k e².

U_central is 24 k e².

Total U =24 +132 =156 k e².

Wait, wait, but that would make U=156 k e².

Compute 156 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, let me compute that.

156 * k * e^2.

k=8.988e9, e²=2.566e-38.

156 *8.988e9 = let's compute 156 *8.988e9.

Compute 156 *8.988.

Multiply 156 *8=1248.

156 *0.988 ≈ 156*(1-0.012)=156 -1.872=154.128.

Total ≈1248 +154.128=1402.128.

So 156 *8.988e9≈1402.128e9=1.402128e12.

Multiply by 2.566e-38: 1.402128e12 *2.566e-38 = (1.402128 *2.566) e(12-38)=3.599e-26.

Wait, 1.402128 *2.566 ≈ approx 3.599.

So 3.599e-26 J.

Hmm, that's 3.599e-26 J, but the options don't have that. The closest is option A:5.645e-26, which is about 50% higher.

Wait, but perhaps the mutual distances are not 2 meters. Perhaps the mutual distances are larger, leading to a lower U_mutual.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is being neglected because the problem is simplified.

But I'm not making progress here. Let me think again.

The problem states that the system is isolated. So the potential energy is the sum of all the interactions.

But without knowing the mutual distances between the 12 charges, I can't compute U_mutual. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge's interactions, and the mutual interactions are zero or not considered.

But that leads to approximately 5.5e-27 J, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that each pair is counted twice in the sum, so the correct approach is to use (1/2) * sum, but that applies when you're summing all pairs. But in this case, the central charge is fixed, and the 12 charges are each interacting with it once, so that approach wouldn't apply.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula, such as considering the energy as U = (k q^2)/(2r), but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another approach: each of the 12 charges is 2e, so the total charge is 12 *2e=24e, but that's the charge on the system. Wait, but the central charge is 2e, so the total charge is 2e + 12*2e=26e.

But that doesn't directly help with the potential energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12, but without the 2 in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator. Let me recheck.

Each charge is at 2 meters from P, so r=2m.

So each U_i = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2) = (4e² k)/2 = 2e² k.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula without dividing by 2, leading to 4e² k per charge.

Which would give 12 *4e² k=48 k e².

Compute 48 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

e²=2.566e-38.

48 *8.988e9 = 4.314e11.

4.314e11 *2.566e-38 =4.314*2.566=11.05. So 11.05e-27 =1.105e-26 J.

Which is approximately 1.105e-26 J. But that's not among the options either.

The options are A:5.645e-26, B:2.822e-26, C:7.056e-27, D:122.330.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Maybe the problem is considering the potential energy as (1/2) * sum of all pairs. So for the central charge and the 12 charges, the sum is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2) =12 * (2 k e² )=24 k e². If we then multiply by (1/2), that would give 12 k e².

Wait, but why would we multiply by 1/2? Because in the pairwise sum, each pair is counted twice. But in this case, the central charge is only interacting with each charge once, so perhaps that approach doesn't apply.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the sum of all pairs, including the central charge and the 12, which would be 12 terms, and the mutual pairs among the 12, which are 66 terms. But without knowing the mutual distances, we can't proceed.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should look for another angle.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy of a point charge in an electric field created by other charges. But in this case, the central charge is fixed, so the potential energy of each of the 12 charges would be (k q0 qi )/r.

Which is what I did earlier, leading to 5.5e-27 J.

But since that's not an option, perhaps the problem made a mistake, or perhaps I missed a factor.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the sum of each charge's potential energy in the field of the others, including the central charge.

So, each of the 12 charges has a potential energy of (k *2e *2e ) /2 = 2 k e², and also experiences potential energy from the other 11 charges.

But without knowing the mutual distances, it's impossible to compute, so perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge's contribution.

But again, that leads to the same result as before.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy of a system as (1/2) * Q * V, where Q is the total charge and V is the potential at the point where the charge is placed. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the potential at point P is due to the 12 charges. So, the potential at P is V = k * sum (q_i / r_i ), where r_i is the distance from each charge to P. Here, each charge is at 2m, so V = k * 12*(2e)/(2) )= k*(12*2e)/2 =k*12e.

Then, the potential energy U is (1/2) * Q * V, where Q is the charge at P, which is 2e.

So U = (1/2) * (2e) * (k *12e ) = (1/2) * 2e *12 k e =12 k e².

Which is 12 *k *e².

Compute that:

12 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

e²=2.566e-38.

12 *8.988e9 =107.856e9.

107.856e9 *2.566e-38 =107.856 *2.566= approx 276.65. So 276.65e(9-38)=276.65e-29=2.7665e-27 J.

Which is approximately 2.77e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.5 times higher.

Wait, perhaps the factor of 1/2 is incorrect. Let me recheck the formula.

The potential energy of a charge Q in a potential V is U = Q * V. But when calculating the total potential energy of the system, it's U = (1/2) * sum (Q_i V_i ), where V_i is the potential at the location of charge Q_i due to all charges except Q_i.

In this case, the charge at P (q0) is 2e, and each of the 12 charges is 2e at 2m. So, the potential at q0 due to the 12 charges is V = sum (k qi / r ) =12 * k*(2e)/(2) )=12 *k e.

So, the potential energy of q0 is U0 = q0 * V = 2e * (12 k e )=24 k e².

The potential energy of each of the 12 charges when brought to their positions is U_i = qi * V_i, where V_i is the potential at their position due to all other charges.

The potential at each qi's position is due to q0 and the other 11 charges.

So, V_i = (k q0)/(r) + sum_{j≠i} (k qj)/(r_ij).

Assuming r_ij is the distance between qi and qj, which we don't know, so this approach doesn't help.

So, perhaps this method isn't helpful either.

Given the time I've spent, I think the correct approach is to consider only the interactions between the central charge and the 12, leading to U=24 k e² ≈5.53e-27 J. But since this isn't among the options, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options again. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 5 times larger than my result. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of charges. The problem says 13 charges, 12 at 2m from P, and the 13th fixed at P. So, perhaps the central charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e as well.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between all pairs, including the central charge and the 12, and all mutual pairs among the 12. But without knowing mutual distances, perhaps the problem is making an assumption that all mutual distances are 2m, leading to 66 terms each contributing (k*(2e)^2)/(2).

So, U_central =12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2) =24 k e².

U_mutual=66 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2) =66 *2 k e² =132 k e².

Total U=24 +132 =156 k e².

Compute 156 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

156 *8.988e9=1.402e12.

1.402e12 *2.566e-38=3.599e-26 J.

Which is approximately 3.6e-26 J. But the options don't have that either.

Wait, but option A is 5.645e-26, which is larger. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are not 2m. Maybe they're arranged in such a way that the mutual potential energy is zero, which is impossible for positive charges. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge's interactions.

Given all this, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but the closest option is option C (7.056e-27), perhaps due to a miscalculation on my part.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me recompute 24 * k * e².

k =8.988e9.

e=1.602e-19.

Compute e²= (1.602e-19)^2= 2.566e-38.

Compute 24 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

24 *8.988e9=24 *8.988=215.712 → 215.712e9.

Multiply by 2.566e-38: 215.712e9 *2.566e-38 =215.712 *2.566= approx 553.6 → 553.6e(9-38)=553.6e-29=5.536e-27 J.

Which is approximately 5.536e-27 J.

Looking at the options, none match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 others, but each charge is at 1 meter, not 2 meters. But the problem states 2 meters. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for gravitational potential energy, but that's not applicable here.

Hmm. I'm not finding the correct answer among the options, but I think the correct calculation leads to approximately 5.54e-27 J. However, since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is calculated as (k q^2)/(r) per charge, but why?

Wait, perhaps the problem is using r = 1 meter instead of 2 meters. Let me try that.

r=1 m.

Each U_i = (k*(2e)^2)/1 =4 k e².

12 charges: 12 *4 k e²=48 k e².

Compute 48 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

48 *8.988e9=4.314e11.

4.314e11 *2.566e-38=1.105e-26 J.

Which is approximately 1.105e-26 J. Closer to option B (2.822e-26), but still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses r=4 meters. Let me check.

If r=4 m, then each U_i = (k*(2e)^2)/4= (4 k e²)/4 =k e².

12 charges: 12 *k e²=12 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38= 12*2.307e-28=2.768e-27 J.

Which is approximately 2.768e-27 J, close to option C (7.056e-27) but still not matching.

Hmm. I'm not getting any of the options to match with any of my calculations. Perhaps I made a mistake in the charge values. The problem says each charge is 2e. So each qi=2e.

Yes.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for electric potential energy between two charges, but only considering one direction, leading to U= (k q1 q2)/(2r), but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula without the 2 in the denominator, leading to higher values.

Wait, if I forget the 2 in the denominator, each U_i would be (k*(2e)^2)/2 m, but that's the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula U=(1/2) (k q1 q2)/r, which would halve the value. For 12 charges, U_central =12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2*2m) =12 * (4e² k)/(4m) )=12 * (e² k)/m.

Wait, but that's not making sense. Let me compute that.

Wait, if U_i = (1/2) * (k*(2e)^2)/(2)= (1/2) * (4 k e²)/(2) )= (1/2) * (2 k e² )=k e².

Then, 12 * k e² =12 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38=12 *2.307e-28=2.768e-27 J.

Again, close to option C but not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula without the 1/2 factor and without the denominator, leading to U= k q1 q2.

Which would be for each charge: U_i= k*(2e)^2= k*4e².

12*4 k e²=48 k e²=48*8.988e9*2.566e-38=48*2.307e-28=1.107e-26 J.

Which is approximately 1.107e-26 J. Closer to option B (2.822e-26), but not matching.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think the correct answer based on the calculations is approximately 5.54e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J, but I'm not sure how that arises.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 24 * k * e².

Let me recompute 24 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute 8.988e9 =8.988 *1e9.

(1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

Multiply 8.988 *2.566=23.063, as before.

23.063e9 *e-38=23.063e-29.

Multiply by 24:23.063e-29 *24=553.512e-29=5.535e-27 J.

Hmm.

Perhaps the correct answer is option C:7.056e-27. But how?

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for Coulomb's constant. Suppose k=9e9 N·m²/C².

Then, U=24 *9e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute 24 *9e9=216e9.

(1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

216e9 *2.566e-38=216*2.566=553.536e-29=5.535e-27 J.

Same result as before. So no difference.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 as (k*(2e)*(2e))/(4m), which would be (4e² k)/(4m)=e²k/m. Then for 12 charges, U=12 * e²k/m.

Wait, but m is 2 meters.

So, 12 * (1.602e-19)^2 *8.988e9/(2).

Compute 12 * (2.566e-38) *8.988e9/(2).

=12 * (2.566e-38 *8.988e9 ) /2.

=12 * (23.06e-29) /2.

=12 *11.53e-29.

=138.36e-29=1.3836e-27 J.

Still not matching the options.

Hmm. At this point, I think I've exhausted all possible approaches. The only option that's in the same order of magnitude as my calculation is option C:7.056e-27 J. But I can't see how to arrive at that value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to use 1 meter instead of 2, leading to higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem expects us to calculate the mutual potential energy as well. But without more information, I can't proceed.

In conclusion, based on the calculations, the correct potential energy is approximately 5.54e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we calculate the total electric potential energy due to the interactions between the charges. The system consists of 13 identical charges, each with charge \( q = 2e \), where \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \). The 13th charge is fixed at point \( P \), and the remaining 12 charges are constrained to stay at a distance of \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \) from \( P \).

### Key Formula
The potential energy between two point charges is given by:
\[
U = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r}
\]
where \( k = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \approx 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \).

### Contributions to Total Potential Energy
1. **Interactions Between the Central Charge and the 12 Charges**:
   - The central charge \( q_0 = 2e \) interacts with each of the 12 charges \( q_i = 2e \) at a distance \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \).
   - Each interaction contributes:
     \[
     U_i = k \frac{(2e)(2e)}{2} = k \frac{4e^2}{2} = 2k e^2
     \]
   - There are 12 such interactions, so the total contribution is:
     \[
     U_{\text{central}} = 12 \cdot 2k e^2 = 24k e^2
     \]

2. **Mutual Interactions Between the 12 Charges**:
   - The problem does not provide information about the mutual distances between the 12 charges. Assuming their mutual potential energy is negligible or not required for the calculation, we focus only on the interactions involving the central charge.

### Total Potential Energy
The total potential energy of the system is dominated by the interactions between the central charge and the 12 charges:
\[
U_{\text{total}} = U_{\text{central}} = 24k e^2
\]

### Numerical Calculation
Substitute the known values:
\[
k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2, \quad e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}, \quad e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2
\]
\[
U_{\text{total}} = 24 \cdot (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.566 \times 10^{-38})
\]
First, calculate \( k \cdot e^2 \):
\[
k \cdot e^2 = (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.566 \times 10^{-38}) = 2.307 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J}
\]
Then multiply by 24:
\[
U_{\text{total}} = 24 \cdot (2.307 \times 10^{-28}) = 5.537 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
\]

### Comparison with Options
The calculated value \( U_{\text{total}} \approx 5.537 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \) does not match any of the given options exactly. However, the closest option is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**. It is possible that the problem assumes additional contributions or rounding differences.

### Conclusion
Based on the calculations and the given options, the most reasonable answer is:

**Answer: C**
