Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me start by reading it carefully and understanding what's being asked.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each represented by a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. 

My goal is to find the elements of the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to the possible states when the observable is measured. The eigenvalues are the possible outcomes of the measurement.

So the operator here is P, which is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, for example, P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. Similarly for the others.

But wait, the operator we're interested in isn't P_x, P_y, or P_z directly. The problem is about an operator along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So that would be the component of P along the direction n. 

I think the operator along an arbitrary direction would be along a unit vector n, which can be written as (n_x, 0, n_z) since it's in the x-z plane. So the operator would be P·n, which is P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1. So n_x = cosθ and n_z = sinθ, assuming θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So I can write P·n as (cosθ) P_x + (sinθ) P_z.

Wait, or is it n_x = sinθ cosφ and n_z = cosθ? Hmm, no, for the x-z plane, the angle θ would be from the z-axis, so n_x = sinθ, and n_z = cosθ. But wait, depends on the coordinate system. Let me think. Usually, in spherical coordinates, the polar angle θ is measured from the positive z-axis. So a point in the x-z plane would have φ=0 (since it's in the plane of x and z) and θ varying. So n_x would be sinθ cosφ, but if φ=0, then n_x = sinθ * 1, and n_z = cosθ. So yes, n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but wait, no, because for a unit vector, the components are (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since φ is 0 for the x-z plane, it'd be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. So the operator P·n is P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem says that the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, and the eigenvector is for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So perhaps the direction n is (n_x, 0, n_z), where n_x² + n_z² = 1.

Wait, but perhaps the operator is along a general direction, but we're to find the eigenvector for the +ħ/2 eigenvalue. Since the operator is P·n, which is a 2x2 matrix, I can write it as a matrix and then find its eigenvectors.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that for spin-1/2 systems, the eigenstates of the Pauli matrices are known. Because each component of P is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Let me recall: σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So P_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, and similarly for P_y and P_z.

Wait, the problem gives P_x as [[0,1],[1,0]] multiplied by ħ/2, which is exactly (ħ/2) σ_x. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, and P_z is (ħ/2) σ_z.

So the operator P·n is n_x P_x + n_z P_z, since n_y is zero. So substituting, that's (n_x (ħ/2) σ_x) + (n_z (ħ/2) σ_z).

Factoring out (ħ/2), we get (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

The eigenvalue equation is P·n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. Because the eigenvalue given is +ħ/2.

Wait, no, because the operator is P·n, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So,

P·n |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>.

So substituting, (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

We can divide both sides by (ħ/2), yielding:

(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = |ψ>.

So the matrix (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) acting on |ψ> gives |ψ>.

Which means that |ψ> is an eigenvector of the matrix (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) with eigenvalue 1.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write the matrix explicitly.

Let me compute the matrix.

n_x σ_x is [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]].

n_z σ_z is [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]].

Adding them gives:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

So the matrix is M = [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

We need to find the eigenvectors of M with eigenvalue 1.

So, the eigenvalue equation is:

M |ψ> = 1 |ψ>.

Which is:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] [[a], [b]] = [ [a], [b] ]

So,

n_z a + n_x b = a,

n_x a - n_z b = b.

Wait, so the equations are:

n_z a + n_x b = a → (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0,

n_x a - n_z b = b → n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0.

We can write these two equations as:

(n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0,

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0.

We can solve this system for a and b.

Let me write it as a homogeneous system.

The equations are:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0,

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0.

We need to find non-trivial solutions (a, b not both zero). For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero.

So the determinant is:

| (n_z -1)    n_x        |
| n_x        (-n_z -1)  |

Which is (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) - (n_x)^2.

Expanding:

= (-n_z^2 -n_z + n_z +1) ) - n_x^2.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

(n_z -1)(-n_z -1) = (-n_z)(n_z -1) -1*(n_z -1) ) = (-n_z^2 +n_z) + (-n_z +1) ) = (-n_z^2 +n_z -n_z +1 ) = (-n_z^2 +1 ).

So the determinant is ( -n_z^2 +1 ) - (n_x^2) = (1 - n_z^2 -n_x^2).

But since n_x^2 +n_z^2 =1 (because n is a unit vector), 1 -n_z^2 -n_x^2 =0. So yes, the determinant is zero, as expected, because there's an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1.

So the two equations are dependent. So we can pick one equation and find the relation between a and b.

Let's take the first equation: (n_z -1) a + n_x b =0.

So (n_z -1) a = -n_x b.

Divide both sides by b (assuming b≠0):

(n_z -1) (a/b) = -n_x.

Let me let r = a/b. So,

r = [ -n_x ] / (n_z -1 )

Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to parameterize the eigenvector. Let's write the eigenvector in terms of a parameter θ, for example.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Since the Pauli matrices satisfy certain properties. The eigenstates of the Pauli matrices are known.

Wait, the matrix M = n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z.

But since n is in the x-z plane, perhaps the eigenstates have a particular form.

Alternatively, I can think of the states for angular momentum in a particular direction.

Wait, for spin-1/2 systems, the eigenstates of the operator S·n are |+> and |->. The |+> state has eigenvalue +ħ/2, and the |-> has -ħ/2.

Wait, but here, the operator is P·n, which is (ħ/2) times (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). So the eigenvalues would be ±(ħ/2).

So the eigenstate for eigenvalue +ħ/2 is the same as the spin-up state along the direction n.

I remember that the spin-up state along an arbitrary direction can be written as:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |↑> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |↓>,

where θ is the polar angle and φ is the azimuthal angle. But in this case, since n is in the x-z plane, φ is zero. Wait, no—wait, the direction is in the x-z plane, which means φ=0 or φ=π, depending on the direction. Wait, but for the spin-up state, it's along the direction (n_x, 0, n_z), so the general form would be:

cos(θ/2) |↑> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |↓>.

But in the x-z plane, φ=0, so e^{iφ}=1. So the state becomes:

cos(θ/2) |↑> + sin(θ/2) |↓>.

Wait, but what is θ here? θ would be the angle from the z-axis. So if the direction n is in the x-z plane, then θ is measured from the z-axis towards x. So, for example, if n is along +z, θ=0; along +x, θ= π/2.

So the spin-up state along n would be:

cos(θ/2) |↑> + sin(θ/2) |↓>.

So, in terms of basis vectors, |↑> is (1, 0) and |↓> is (0,1). So the eigenvector would be:

[ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.

Wait, but let me double-check this. The eigenstates for S·n are |+> and |->, which are given by:

|+> = e^{-iφ/2} cos(θ/2) |↑> + e^{iφ/2} sin(θ/2) |↓>,

|-> = e^{-iφ/2} sin(θ/2) |↑> - e^{iφ/2} cos(θ/2) |↓>.

But in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so φ=0. So those simplify to:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |↑> + sin(θ/2) |↓>,
|-> = sin(θ/2) |↑> - cos(θ/2) |↓>.

So the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T.

Wait, but let me check the normalization. The sum of squares would be cos²(θ/2) + sin²(θ/2) =1, so it's already normalized.

So the components of the normalized eigenvector are (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches this.

But wait, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), so yes, that's correct.

But let me look back at the problem statement. The options given are:

A) (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ)
B) (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta))
C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))
D) (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2))

Hmm, option C seems to fit what I derived.

Wait, but what about the other options?

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which looks like spherical coordinates for a unit vector, but that's for a vector in 3D space. But our eigenvector is a 2-component spinor, so option B may not directly apply.

Option D has factors involving sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), respectively. That might be if, for example, the direction n had specific angles, but in this case, the direction is arbitrary, so the eigenvector would depend on theta and phi (or theta/2, as in option C).

Wait, but I'm getting (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) as the components, which is option C.

But wait, the operator is P·n, and we're considering the eigenvalue +ħ/2, so the state should be the eigenstate of P·n with this eigenvalue.

But another thought: perhaps I should compute the eigenvector directly from the matrix M that I derived earlier.

So M is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

We set M |ψ> = |ψ>, so (M - I)|ψ> = 0.

So the matrix M - I is [[n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1]].

The system of equations is:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0,

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0.

Let's write the first equation as (n_z -1) a = -n_x b.

Assume b is not zero (if a is zero, we can consider that case, but perhaps it's not necessary here). So,

a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

Wait, but this is getting a bit complicated, especially with n_x and n_z expressed in terms of theta.

Since n is in the x-z plane, and it's a unit vector, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. So substituting, we have:

a = [ -sinθ / (cosθ - 1) ] b.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to express in terms of theta/2.

Wait, cosθ = 1 - 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

Let me substitute these into the expression for a:

a = [ - 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / ( (1 - 2 sin²(theta/2)) - 1 ) ] * b.

Simplify denominator: (1 - 2 sin²(theta/2) ) -1 = -2 sin²(theta/2).

So,

a = [ - 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / ( -2 sin²(theta/2) ) ] * b.

The negatives cancel, and 2s cancel:

a = [ sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / sin²(theta/2) ) ] * b.

Simplify:

a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] * b.

So a = cot(theta/2) * b.

Which can be written as a = [cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2)] b.

So, if I let b = sin(theta/2), then a = cos(theta/2).

So the eigenvector is [a; b] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, which matches what I found earlier.

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is correct.

Another option, D, includes factors of sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), respectively. But in our case, the eigenvector is normalized, so the sum of squares of the components must be 1.

So in option C, cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) = 1, which is correct.

In option D, the components are sqrt(2/3) cos(theta/2) and sqrt(1/3) sin(theta/2). The sum of squares would be (2/3) cos^2 + (1/3) sin^2. Which isn't 1 unless cos^2 = sin^2 =1, which isn't generally true. So option D isn't normalized unless theta is a specific value.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, and $\sigma_z$, respectively. The operator along the direction $\vec{n}$ is $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$ since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane.

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle,
\]

where $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ can be expressed as:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z \right).
\]

Substituting $\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$, the matrix representation of $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation simplifies to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

\[
(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0, \quad n_x a + (-n_z - 1)b = 0.
\]

Solving these equations, the eigenvector is proportional to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix},
\]

where $\theta$ is the polar angle of the direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane. This eigenvector is already normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$  
  This does not depend on $\theta$ and is not the general form of the eigenvector for an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$.

- **Option B**: $(\cos(\theta), e^{i\phi}\sin(\theta))$  
  This represents a point on the unit sphere in 3D space, not a 2-component spinor, and is therefore incorrect.

- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This matches the derived eigenvector and is normalized.

- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This introduces additional normalization factors that are not present in the general solution.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**, as it matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
