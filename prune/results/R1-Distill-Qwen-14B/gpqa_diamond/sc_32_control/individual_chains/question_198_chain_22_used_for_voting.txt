Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see... The question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in solution. Hmm, okay.

So the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the different complexes are given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, stability constants usually tell us about the formation of complexes. Each beta represents the formation constant for a particular complex. So, CoSCN+ would be the first complex, then maybe Co(SCN)_2^2+, and so on up to the fourth.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Dithiocyanato would be the one with two SCN- ligands, I think. So that's the Co(SCN)₂²+ complex, right? So the second complex, which has β2=40.

Wait, but wait, the stability constants are given as β1, β2, etc. So for each step, the formation of the next complex. So β1 is the formation constant for CoSCN+ from Co²+ and SCN-: Co²+ + SCN- ⇌ CoSCN+; β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co²+][SCN^-]).

Similarly, β2 would be the formation of Co(SCN)₂²+ from CoSCN+ and another SCN-: CoSCN+ + SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN)₂²+; β2 = [Co(SCN)₂²+]/([CoSCN+][SCN^-]).

Wait, but sometimes the overall stability constant for the nth complex is the product of β1 through βn. So the overall K for Co(SCN)_n^(2−n) is β1*β2*…*βn. So for the second complex, K2=β1*β2. Same for K3=β1β2β3, and K4=β1β2β3β4.

But wait, in this problem, the question is about the distribution of the different cobalt species. So the Co²+ is the starting point, and each subsequent species is a complex with more SCN- ions. So the possible species are:

Co²+ → not complexed,

CoSCN+ → first complex,

Co(SCN)₂²+ → second,

Co(SCN)₃^3- → third,

Co(SCN)₄^4- → fourth.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is the second one, Co(SCN)₂²+.

So I think I need to calculate the fraction of each species in solution and then find the percentage of the second complex.

The approach is to use the stability constants to find the fraction of each species. The general formula for the fraction of each complex is based on the log of the overall stability constant and the concentrations.

Wait, but considering all the species, the distribution depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand and metal ions. Since the total cobalt concentration is fixed, the fractions will sum to 1.

I remember that the distribution of metal complexes can be determined using the stepwise formation constants. The fraction of each species is given by:

f_n = (K_n * [M^(n)])/ (1 + K1 [L] + K1K2 [L]^2 + ... + K1K2...Kn [L]^n )

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, each species MnL^n has a certain fraction based on the product of the formation constants up to that step, multiplied by the ligand concentration to the power of the number of ligands.

Wait, the fraction of each species is given by:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [L]^n) / (1 + β1 [L] + β1β2 [L]^2 + β1β2β3 [L]^3 + ... + β1β2β3β4 [L]^4 )

But wait, for each species, the overall stability constant is the product of the beta values up to that species.

So for the first complex (CoSCN+), K1 = β1 =9.

For the second (Co(SCN)₂²+), K2= β1β2=9*40=360.

For the third, K3= β1β2β3=9*40*63=22680.

And the fourth, K4=9*40*63*16=40320.

Wait, but the concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M, which is [L]=0.1 M. Each species n requires n SCN- ions, so [L]^n.

So the denominator is the sum for each species, including the uncomplexed Co²+ (which is n=0, so 1).

The fractions are calculated as (K_n [L]^n ) / denominator.

Wait, but I think that the denominator is the sum of all the terms for n from 0 to 4, where each term is K_n [L]^n.

Wait, but wait, for each species, the term is (β1β2...βn) [L]^n, except for n=0, which is 1.

So the denominator D is 1 + (β1 [L]) + (β1β2 [L]^2) + (β1β2β3 [L]^3) + (β1β2β3β4 [L]^4 )

So let's compute each term.

Given [L] =0.1 M.

Compute each term:

n=0: 1

n=1: β1 [L] =9 * 0.1 =0.9

n=2: β1β2 [L]^2=9*40*(0.1)^2= 360 *0.01=3.6

n=3: β1β2β3 [L]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68

n=4: β1β2β3β4 [L]^4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4= 40320 *0.0001=4.032

So the denominator D is 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +4.032.

Let me add them up step by step:

1 +0.9 =1.9

1.9 +3.6 =5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +4.032=32.212

So D=32.212.

Now, the term for n=2 is 3.6.

So the fraction f_2 is 3.6 / 32.212.

Let me compute that.

3.6 /32.212 ≈ 0.1117 or about 11.17%.

Wait, but wait a second. The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is Co(SCN)₂²+. So that would be the n=2 case. So why am I getting about 11%? But the options are 16.9, 25.6, etc. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate each term.

n=0: 1 →1.

n=1: β1 [L]=9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2: β1β2 [L]^2=9 *40 * (0.1)^2 → 360 *0.01=3.6.

n=3: β1β2β3 [L]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3 → 22680 *0.001=22.68.

n=4: β1β2β3β4 [L]^4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4 → 40320 *0.0001=4.032.

So adding them up: 1 + 0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +4.032=32.212. So denominator is 32.212.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the terms. Let me think again. The term for each species is K_n [L]^n, but K_n is the product of beta up to that n.

Wait, but wait, is the overall K for the second complex K2=β1*β2, yes. So that part is correct.

Hmm, so f_2 =3.6 /32.212 ≈0.1117, which is 11.17%, but none of the options are around 11%. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, wait, perhaps the formula is slightly different. Maybe the fractions are computed as [M]_n = (β1β2...βn [L]^n) / (1 + β1 [L] + β1β2 [L]^2 + ... + β1β2...β4 [L]^4 )

But then for each species, the concentration is [M]_n = (K_n [L]^n ) / D, where D is the sum.

So what's the [M]_n for n=2?

It's 3.6 /32.212 ≈0.1117 M. So that's approximately 11.17%.

But the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. But according to the options, the closest is D) 16.9%. But I'm not getting that. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula considers the formation of each complex step by step, including the previous steps. Let me think about the distribution equations again.

The general approach for the distribution of each species is:

For each n from 0 to 4, the fraction f_n is (K_n [L]^n) / D, where D is the sum of all K_n [L]^n terms.

Wait, but perhaps I've made a mistake with the K_n. Because K_n is the cumulative product up to beta_n. Let me confirm:

For species Co(SCN)_n^{2-n}, the overall formation constant is K_n = β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

So for n=1, K1=9. n=2, K2=9*40=360. n=3, K3=9*40*63=22680. n=4, K4=9*40*63*16=40320.

Then, the terms are K_n [L]^n.

So for n=0, term is 1.

n=1: 9 * 0.1 =0.9.

n=2: 360 * (0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

n=3: 22680 * (0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68.

n=4:40320 * (0.1)^4=40320 *0.0001=4.032.

Adding all terms: 1+0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +4.032=32.212.

So the denominator D is 32.212.

So f_2 is 3.6 /32.212 ≈0.1117, or 11.17%. Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, but the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, β4 is 16, which is lower than β3. That might affect the distribution, as the higher the K, the more likely the complex will form.

Wait, maybe I should think about the log of the terms.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing some other factor. Wait, the total concentration of cobalt is given as 0.01 M. But in the calculation, we have the denominator as 32.212, which is higher than the total cobalt, which is 0.01 M. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in how I'm applying the formation constants.

Wait, the formula for the fraction is f_n = (K_n [L]^n) / (sum of all K_i [L]^i for i=0 to 4).

So I think my approach is correct. But the answer I'm getting isn't matching any of the options. So maybe I made a computational error.

Wait, let me re-calculate each term precisely.

n=0: 1.

n=1: 9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2: (9*40) * (0.1)^2 =360 *0.01=3.6.

n=3: (9*40*63) * (0.1)^3 = (22680) * 0.001=22.68.

n=4: (9*40*63*16) * (0.1)^4 = (40320) * 0.0001=4.032.

Sum: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +4.032=32.212.

So that's correct.

Hmm... So f_2=3.6 /32.212 ≈0.1117, which is about 11.17%, but the options don't have that. So maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses βn as the overall K for each step, but another approach is to calculate the conditional formation constants. Alternatively, maybe I should be using the logarithm of the fractions.

Wait, another approach is to use the distribution equation for each species. Let's think about it in terms of the logarithm.

Wait, maybe the fraction for each species can be found by considering the log of the formation constants and the ligand concentration. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

log(f_n) = n log β_avg - n log([L]) - log(D)

But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is the Co(SCN)_2^2+ ion. Perhaps this corresponds to the second complex, which is the one I calculated as 3.6 in the denominator sum.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the question is about the dithiocyanato, but what if it's the third complex? No, because dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ligands, which is the second complex (n=2).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the stability constants are provided in a different way. Like, perhaps β2 is the stability constant for the second complex, not the step-wise beta. Wait, that's another possibility. Oh, wait, the problem says the stability constants of the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that might not make sense because β4=16 is lower than β3=63. Typically, the stability constants increase with the number of ligands. So perhaps the problem uses the overall stability constants K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16. But that would be unusual because K usually increases with more ligands. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the given β's.

Alternatively, perhaps the given β's are the stepwise formation constants. So each βn is the formation constant for adding the nth ligand.

In that case, the overall K for Co(SCN)_n^(2-n) is K_n = β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

So for the second complex, K2 = β1 * β2 =9*40=360.

So the terms I calculated earlier are correct.

Wait, perhaps I can check the options. Let's compute the fractions for each species and see which matches the options.

So the fractions are:

n=0: 1/32.212 ≈0.03104 →3.104%.

n=1:0.9/32.212 ≈0.02793 →2.793%.

n=2:3.6/32.212≈0.1117 →11.17%.

n=3:22.68/32.212≈0.704 →70.4%.

n=4:4.032/32.212≈0.125 →12.5%.

Wait, that can't be right because n=3 is the highest, but in the options, the highest is option C) 38.1%, which is less than 70%.

Hmm. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the beta values are not step-wise but overall for each complex. Wait, but if β2 is the overall stability constant for the second complex, then K2=40, not 9*40=360.

In that case, the terms would be:

n=0:1.

n=1: K1=9 →9*(0.1)^1=0.9.

n=2: K2=40 →40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

n=3: K3=63 →63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

n=4: K4=16 →16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

So the denominator D would be 1+0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016=1+0.9=1.9, +0.4=2.3, +0.063=2.363, +0.0016=2.3646.

So D=2.3646.

Then, the fraction for n=2 is 0.4/2.3646≈0.169 →16.9%.

Which matches option D) 16.9%.

Ah, so I think that's the correct approach. The stability constants provided are the overall K for each complex, not the step-wise betas. So β1 is the K for CoSCN+, β2 is K for Co(SCN)₂²+, etc.

In that case, the calculation changes. So the initial approach was wrong because I assumed the betas were step-wise, but perhaps they're given as overall K values.

So the correct way is to treat each β as the overall K for the nth complex.

So the terms are:

n=0:1.

n=1: β1 * [L]^1 =9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2: β2 * [L]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

n=3:β3 * [L]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

n=4:β4 * [L]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

Sum D=1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So the denominator is 2.3646.

The fraction for n=2 is 0.4 /2.3646= approx 0.169, which is 16.9%.

Which is option D. So the correct answer should be D) 16.9%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)₂²+, in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants (β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16) and the ligand concentration [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the goal is to find the fraction of Co(SCN)₂²+ among all cobalt species.

### Key Steps:
1. **Interpretation of Stability Constants**:  
   The stability constants provided are interpreted as the overall formation constants for each complex:
   - β₁: Overall stability constant for CoSCN⁺.
   - β₂: Overall stability constant for Co(SCN)₂²+.
   - β₃: Overall stability constant for Co(SCN)₃³⁻.
   - β₄: Overall stability constant for Co(SCN)₄⁴⁻.

2. **Distribution Formula**:  
   The fraction of each cobalt species is given by:
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\sum_{n=0}^4 \beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of SCN⁻ ligands bound to cobalt.

3. **Calculation of Terms**:  
   For each species, calculate the term \(\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n\):
   - \( n=0 \): Term = 1.
   - \( n=1 \): Term = \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \).
   - \( n=2 \): Term = \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4 \).
   - \( n=3 \): Term = \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063 \).
   - \( n=4 \): Term = \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016 \).

4. **Denominator Calculation**:  
   Sum all terms to find the denominator:
   \[
   D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

5. **Fraction of Co(SCN)₂²+**:  
   The fraction of Co(SCN)₂²+ is:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\text{Term for } n=2}{D} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
   \]
   Converting to percentage:
   \[
   f_2 \times 100 \approx 16.9\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)₂²+, in the solution is **16.9%**.

Answer: D
