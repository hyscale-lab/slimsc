Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I need to find the maximum speed of the mass. Let me think about what I remember from my studies.

Alright, so the problem is in one dimension, and it's relativistic, meaning I probably can't use the classical equations of motion. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which I know is F = -kx, but wait, in relativity, forces might be treated differently because of the relativistic mass or something like that.

Wait, no, wait. In relativity, the mass isn't a constant but depends on velocity. So maybe the equation of motion changes. Oh right, the relativistic harmonic oscillator would have a different form than the classical one.

In the non-relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the total energy is (1/2)kA². The maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. So, (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA². Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, the question is relativistic, so this can't be the answer. Hmm, so options C is probably not the correct one.

But wait, I'm not sure. Let's think again. In relativity, kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but wait, for a harmonic oscillator, the energy is quantized, but maybe in this problem, it's treated classically. Hmm.

Wait, the problem is about the maximum speed. So, perhaps it's about when the potential energy is maximum, but in relativity, the energy expressions are different. Let me model the equations.

In a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the equation of motion is different. The force is F = -kx, but the relativistic mass is gamma m. So the equation would be d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x. But that's a bit complicated.

Alternatively, maybe using energy conservation. The total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and the potential energy, but wait. Alternatively, the total energy in the oscillator would be a combination of kinetic and potential, but I'm not sure.

Wait, in the relativistic case, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy isn't (1/2 mv²) anymore. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x=A), all the energy is potential. When it's at x=0, all the energy is kinetic. So E_total = (1/2)k A², but that's only the potential energy at maximum amplitude. So at x=0, the kinetic energy is E_total, which is (gamma - 1)mc², because relativistic KE is (gamma -1)mc².

Wait, but wait. So if the total energy is E = mc² + (1/2)k A². Wait, that might be the case. Because the oscillator's total energy includes the rest mass energy plus the potential energy.

So when the mass is at x=A, all energy is potential: E = (1/2)k A². But that can't be right because in relativity, the rest mass energy is mc², so maybe the energy is the sum of rest energy and the potential energy.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. In the non-relativistic case, the total energy is (1/2)kA², and this equals the maximum kinetic energy. But in the relativistic case, the potential energy at maximum displacement would be (1/2)kA², and the total energy would be the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy? Or is the potential energy part of the total energy?

Hmm, perhaps another approach. The relativistic virial theorem states that the average kinetic energy equals the average potential energy, but that's for oscillators. But this might not directly help here since it's about maximum speed, not averages.

Alternatively, consider that the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energy and the non-relativistic potential energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)k A². Then, at the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc² = E - mc² = (1/2)k A².

So, (gamma -1) mc² = (1/2)k A².

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Wait, because (gamma -1) = (k A²)/(2 m c²). So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

But wait, let's compute that. Let me write it as:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = [ 2 m c² + k A² ] / (2 m c² )

Hmm. But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = [2 m c² + k A² ] / (2 m c² )

Let me compute the RHS: [2 m c² + k A² ] / (2 m c² ) = [2 m c²/(2 m c²) ) ] + [k A²/(2 m c²) ]

Which is (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)) ) 

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) 

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some term, say, let's say a = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Then the equation becomes:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + a 

So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 +a )

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + a )^2 

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1+a )^2 ] 

= [ (1+a )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a )^2 

Expand the numerator:

(1 + 2a + a²) -1 = 2a + a² 

So,

v²/c² = (2a + a² ) / (1 +a )^2 

= a (2 + a ) / (1 +a )^2 

But wait, a is (k A²)/(2 m c²) = [k A²/(2m)] / c². Let me write a = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v = c sqrt[ a (2 + a ) / (1 +a )^2 ]

Hmm, but let's plug in a = (k A²)/(2 m c²):

v² = c² [ (k A²/(2 m c² )) * (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )]^2

Simplify numerator inside the brackets:

[ (k A²/(2 m c² )) * (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ] 

= [ (k A²/(2 m c² )) ] * [ ( (4 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c²) ) ) ]

Wait, because 2 is 4 m c²/(2 m c² ), so 2 = 4 m c²/(2 m c²).

Hmm, maybe it's easier to factor:

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Wait, another approach: let's factor out the a term.

So,

v² = c² [ a (2 + a ) ] / (1 + a )^2 

= c² [ a (2 + a ) ] / ( (1 + a )^2 )

Hmm. Let me see if any of the options match this.

Looking at the options:

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2m ))^2 )

Wait, let me compute 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m)) )^2.

Wait, that might not align. Let me think of each option.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2 m c²)) ) )

Wait, but I have terms involving a, which is kA²/(2 m c²). So the denominator in my expression for v is sqrt( ... ), let me see.

Wait, in the expression I have v²/c² = [ a (2 + a ) ] / (1 + a )² 

Which can be rewritten as:

v²/c² = [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a )² 

Let me factor the numerator:

a (2 +a ) = a ( a + 2 )

Denominator: (1 + a )²

So,

= [ a (a + 2) ] / (1 + a )² 

= [ (a + 2) a ] / ( (1 + a )^2 )

Hmm, perhaps I can factor a + 2 as (1 + a ) + 1 

But I'm not sure. Let me compute the numerator and denominator in terms of a.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as:

v²/c² = [a (a + 2 ) ] / (1 + a )² 

= [ a (a + 2 ) ] / ( (a + 1 )^2 )

Hmm. Let me compute this for small a. If a is small, like when k A² is much less than 2 m c², then a is small.

In that limit, the denominator is (1 + a )² ≈ 1 + 2a.

The numerator: a (a + 2 ) ≈ 2a + a² ≈ 2a.

So,

v²/c² ≈ (2a)/(1 + 2a ) ≈ 2a (1 - 2a ) ≈ 2a - 4a².

Which would approach 2a when a is very small. And 2a is (k A²)/(m c² ), because 2a = 2*(k A²)/(2 m c²) )= k A²/(m c² )

So v ≈ c sqrt( 2a ) = c sqrt( (k A²)/(m c²) ) ) = sqrt( (k A² )/( m ) ) ) = sqrt(k/m ) A, which is the classical result, as expected when speeds are much smaller than c.

So, that matches with the non-relativistic case. So the formula I derived must be correct in the limit.

Now, looking at the options, which one reduces to the correct non-relativistic case.

Option C is the non-relativistic result, so it's not correct in the relativistic case.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2 m c² )) )) 

Hmm, let me compute that.

Let me compute the term inside the square root.

1 + 1/(1 - a ), where a = kA²/(2 m c² )

So,

1 + 1/(1 - a ) = [ (1 - a ) + 1 ] / (1 - a ) 

= (2 - a ) / (1 - a )

So, sqrt( (2 - a)/(1 - a) ) 

Wait, but in my expression, v²/c² is [a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a )^2.

Hmm. Not matching.

Option D: sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c² ))^2 ) )

Wait, let's compute the term inside:

1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 

Which is [ (1 + a )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a )^2 

= (1 + 2a + a² - 1) / (1 + a )^2 

= (2a + a²) / (1 + a )^2 

So,

v = c sqrt( [2a + a² ] / (1 + a )^2 )

Which is same as [ sqrt( a (2 +a ) ) ] / (1 + a )

Hmm, which is exactly what my expression for v²/c² is (since v² = c² * [a(2 +a )/(1+a )^2 ] )

So v = c * sqrt( [a (2 +a ) ] ) / (1 +a )

Which is the same as c * sqrt( [ a (2+a) ] ) / (1 +a )

Alternatively, sqrt(a (2 +a )) = sqrt( a (1 + a + 1 ) ) = not sure. Let me compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps it can be written as sqrt(a (2 +a )) = sqrt( (a + 1 )^2 - 1 )

Wait, (a + 1 )^2 = a² + 2a +1. So (a+1)^2 -1 = a² +2a. So yeah, a(2 +a ) = a^2 + 2a = (a+1)^2 -1.

So,

sqrt( a (2 +a ) ) = sqrt( (a +1 )^2 -1 )

So,

v = c [ sqrt( (a+1 )^2 -1 ) ] / (a +1 )

= c sqrt(1 - 1/(a+1 )^2 )

Wait, because sqrt( (a+1 )^2 -1 ) / (a+1 ) = sqrt( 1 - 1/(a+1 )^2 )

Because,

sqrt( (a+1 )^2 -1 ) / (a+1 ) = sqrt( [ (a+1 )^2 (1 - 1/(a+1 )^2 ) ] ) / (a+1 )

= (a+1 ) * sqrt( 1 - 1/(a+1 )^2 ) / (a+1 )

= sqrt(1 - 1/(a+1 )^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 )

Which is exactly option D. Because option D is:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + kA²/(2 m c² ))^2 ] )

Which is the same as what I have here because a = kA²/(2 m c²).

So, the correct option is D.

Wait, but let me check again. Because I thought the correct formula I derived was:

v^2/c^2 = a(2 + a) / (1 + a )^2.

Which when I rearrange becomes [a(2 +a ) ] / (1 +a )^2 = [ (2a + a^2 ) ] / (1 + 2a + a^2 )

But I'm getting a bit confused about the algebra, but option D seems to match.

Wait, looking back, option D is:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c² ))^2 ) )

Wait, no, option D is: sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c² ))^2 ) )

Wait, let me recheck the options.

Option D says: v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Wait, yes, so the denominator is (1 + (kA²/(2 m c² )) ) squared.

Which is same as (1 + a )^2, which matches what I have in v.

Wait, because v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 )

Which is option D.

Wait, but let me make sure.

Wait, in my calculation, I had v = c sqrt( [ a (2 + a ) ] ) / (1 + a )

Which can be written as c sqrt( a(2+a) ) / (1+a )

Alternatively, sqrt(a(2+a)) = sqrt( (a+1)^2 -1 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( (a+1)^2 - 1 ) / (a+1 )

= c * sqrt(1 - [1/(a+1)^2] )

So yes, that's the same as option D.

So the correct answer is option D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the relativistic energy conservation. The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement:

\[
E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is kinetic, which in relativistic terms is given by:

\[
\text{Kinetic Energy} = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
\]

Equating the total energy to the kinetic energy at \( x = 0 \), we have:

\[
(\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

Solving for \( \gamma \), we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

The relativistic gamma factor is defined as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \) into this expression, we solve for \( v_{\text{max}} \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Let \( a = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = 1 + a
\]

\[
\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + a}
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + a)^2}
\]

\[
v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + a)^2}
\]

\[
v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 = \frac{(1 + a)^2 - 1}{(1 + a)^2}
\]

\[
v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 = \frac{2a + a^2}{(1 + a)^2}
\]

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{\frac{2a + a^2}{(1 + a)^2}}
\]

Substituting \( a = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we find:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}
\]

This matches **Option D**. The other options are inconsistent with the relativistic energy conservation and the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \).

**Answer: D**
