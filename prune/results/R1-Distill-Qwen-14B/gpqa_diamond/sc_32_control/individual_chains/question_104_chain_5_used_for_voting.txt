Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves a little bit as the planet orbits it, right?

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits, so that should simplify things a bit.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift in the spectral line, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I need to find the ratio of the orbital periods, P2/P1. But how does the Doppler shift relate to the orbital period? I think the size of the Doppler shift is related to the mass of the planet and the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. Oh right, the shift (called the semi-amplitude) K is proportional to the star's velocity.

The formula I remember is K = (v * sin i) where v is the star's velocity. But v is related to the planet's orbital parameters. Oh right, the more massive the planet, the bigger the velocity. But in this case, both planets have similar masses to Neptune, so their masses are roughly the same. So the main factors would be the orbital period and the distance from the star.

Wait, no, wait. The Doppler shift's semi-amplitude K is given by a formula involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance. Let me try to recall the exact formula.

I think the formula for K is something like:

K = ( (2πG) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star)^(2/3) )

But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact terms. Alternatively, I've read that K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / P)^(1/3) * (something with the orbit's semi-major axis? Or maybe the velocity is related to the distance of the star's movement, which depends on the planet's distance.)

Wait, another approach: The star's velocity K is given by (v) = (2π a sin i) / P, where a is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the barycenter. But since the star's mass is much larger than the planet, a is approximately (M_p/(M_star + M_p)) * a_planet, but since M_p is much smaller than M_star, a ≈ (M_p / M_star) * a_planet.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another thought: The Doppler shift (K) is proportional to the velocity of the star, which in turn depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period. Alternatively, the star's velocity is given by K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / (a) ]^(1/3) * (something) / (M_star)^(2/3) * (1/P)^(1/3) )

Wait, I think the formula is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / c), where c is the speed of light. But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, I can approximate (M_star + M_p) ≈ M_star. So K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) ) * (1/c )

But in this problem, both planets have similar masses to Neptune, and the stars have the same mass as the Sun. So M_p and M_star are the same for both planets. So we can ignore differences in M_p and M_star because they are the same. So K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3) because the numerator has M_p which is same, and denominator has M_star^(2/3) which is same, so K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

Wait, wait. Let me see: if K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Since M_p and M_star are same for both, then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1 = (1 / P1^(1/3)) * constant, and K2 = (1 / P2^(1/3)) * same constant.

So the ratio K2/K1 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3). Because K2 = (constant) / P2^(1/3), K1 = (constant) / P1^(1/3). So K2/K1 = (P1^(1/3)) / (P2^(1/3)) ) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

But in this problem, the shifts are K1 =5 milliangstroms and K2=7. So K2/K1 =7/5 =1.4.

So 7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So we can cube both sides. (7/5)^3 = P1/P2

So P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3

Wait, wait, let me double-check. Let me write K2 = (constant) / P2^(1/3), K1 = (constant) / P1^(1/3).

So K2/K1 = P1^(1/3) / P2^(1/3) => (K2/K1) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Which can be rearranged to (P1/P2) = (K2/K1)^3

So P1 = P2 * (K2/K1)^3

Wait, no. Let me rearrange:

K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

(K2/K1)^3 = P1/P2

So P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3

Because if P1/P2 = (K2/K1)^3, then P2 = P1 / (K2/K1)^3 ) = P1 * (K1/K2)^3

So the ratio of P2 to P1 is (K1/K2)^3.

Because the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1, which is P2/P1.

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Given K1=5, K2=7,

P2/P1 = (5/7)^3

Calculating (5/7)^3. 5/7 is approximately 0.714. 0.714^3 is roughly 0.714 *0.714 = ~0.51, then 0.51 *0.714 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, 5/7 is about 0.7143. So 0.7143 cubed:

0.7143^3: 0.7143 *0.7143 = approx 0.5102, then 0.5102 *0.7143 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 is approximately 0.364, which is about 0.36 times. So P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1, meaning P2 is shorter. Wait, but the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1, so if P2 is shorter, the ratio would be <1. But according to our calculation, it's 0.36 times longer, which is actually shorter. So that would mean that P2's period is shorter than P1's.

Wait a moment, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 must be smaller than P1. Because a larger K implies a smaller period.

So in the options, the options are given as how many times longer P2 is than P1. So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, that means P2 is shorter, so the ratio is 0.36, which is option A: ~0.36.

Wait, but wait. Let me confirm.

If K is larger, the period should be shorter. Because K is (proportional to) 1/(P^(1/3)), so if K increases, P must decrease.

In this case, Planet #2 has a larger K (7 mA vs 5), so P2 should be smaller than P1.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is 0.36 times the period of P1, meaning it's shorter.

But the question is asking how many times longer is P2's period than P1's, so that would be P2/P1. Since it's 0.36, it's shorter, so P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1, meaning it's about 0.36 times longer. So the answer would be option A (~0.36).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

If K is larger, the period is shorter. So for planet #2, K is larger (7 vs 5), so P2 is smaller than P1. So P2 is about 0.36 * P1.

So how many times longer is P2 than P1?

If P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's shorter, so it's not longer. So the ratio is less than 1. So the question is, is the question asking P2/P1? Yes.

So the ratio is 0.36, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

The Doppler shift K is given by:

K = (v_star) = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) * (1/c )

But I'm not confident about that. Alternatively, the formula I think I've heard is that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) P^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the relation between the semi-amplitude K and the orbital period.

Alternatively, since the Doppler shift is K = v, and the velocity is related to the orbital speed of the star. The star's velocity is given by v = (2π a_star) / P, where a_star is the star's orbit around the barycenter.

But a_star is (M_p/(M_star + M_p)) * a_planet. Since M_p << M_star, a_star ≈ (M_p / M_star) * a_planet.

But a_planet is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law. For a planet orbiting a star of mass M, the semi-major axis a is given by a^3 = (G M P^2) / (4π^2).

So a_planet^3 = (G M_star P^2) / (4π^2)

So, a_star = (M_p / M_star) * a_planet = (M_p / M_star) * [ (G M_star P^2 / (4π^2) )^(1/3) ]

Simplify this:

a_star = (M_p / M_star) * [ ( G M_star P^2 )^(1/3) ) / (4π^2)^(1/3) ) ]

= (M_p / M_star) * ( G M_star )^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / (4π^2)^(1/3)

= M_p * ( G )^(1/3) M_star^(-2/3) P^(2/3) ) / (4π^2)^(1/3)

Then, the velocity v (which is K) is v = 2π a_star / P.

So:

v = 2π / P * [ M_p ( G )^(1/3) M_star^(-2/3) P^(2/3) ) / (4π^2)^(1/3) ]

Simplify this:

v = 2π / P * M_p ( G^(1/3) ) M_star^(-2/3) P^(2/3) ) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) )

Let me compute the exponents:

G^(1/3) is just a constant.

M_p is same for both.

M_star is same for both, so M_star^(-2/3) is same.

Now, let's collect the terms:

v ∝ (1/P) * P^(2/3) ) = P^(-1/3).

So v is proportional to P^(-1/3), which confirms the earlier conclusion that K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So the same reasoning applies.

So, K2/K1 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3)

So,

(P1 / P2) = (K2 / K1)^3

So,

P2 = P1 * (K1 / K2)^3

P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So the answer is approximately 0.36 times, which is option A.

To determine how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the Doppler shift (semi-amplitude, \( K \)) and the orbital period (\( P \)) using the radial velocity method. The semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), meaning \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \). This relationship arises because the star's velocity, which determines \( K \), depends on the orbital speed and the orbital period.

Given:
- \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) for Planet #1,
- \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) for Planet #2,

we can write the ratio of \( K_2 \) to \( K_1 \) as:
\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{P_1}{P_2}^{1/3}.
\]

Rearranging for \( P_2/P_1 \):
\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3.
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):
\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3.
\]

Calculating:
\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times longer than that of Planet #1. This corresponds to option **A**.
