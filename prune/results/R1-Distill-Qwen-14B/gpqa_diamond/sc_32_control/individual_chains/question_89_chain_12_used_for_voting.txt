Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C, which gives a light yellow solid product 1. The 1H NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). There's also an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹.

Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR, excluding those that exchange with the solvent.

Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH (excess) heated to 240°C.

I'm thinking elimination reaction here. KOH is a strong base, so probably an E2 mechanism. The dibromide would lose two equivalents of HBr, forming a diene. Wait, but adamantane is a very rigid structure, so perhaps the product is an allene or a diene.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane... So if it's an adamantane molecule, which is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The substituents are at 1 and 3 positions. When treated with KOH, it's likely to eliminate two HBr molecules to form some kind of conjugated diene. But where would the double bonds form?

Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation forming a diradical. But more likely, each Br is at a bridgehead, so elimination would form a double bond between those bridgeheads.

Wait, but in adamantane, the bridgehead carbons are known to be sp³ hybridized and generally don't form double bonds because of the Bredt's rule. Bredt's rule says that bridgehead double bonds are less stable and less likely to form. So perhaps they form a conjugated diene somewhere else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the IR spectrum shows an absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe the product isn't a diene but a ketone? How would that happen?

Oh, wait, maybe the KOH is causing an elimination but also some oxidation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some kind of rearrangement. Or maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: when a dibromide is treated with a strong base like KOH, especially in an elimination reaction, it can form an epoxide if adjacent to Br atoms. But 1,3-dibromo—so perhaps not adjacent? Let me think: 1 and 3 positions on adamantane. If the structure is such that the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, maybe elimination would form a ring with a double bond. But I'm not sure about adamantane's structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a ketone. Wait, but why would that happen? Oh, wait, maybe it's a neighboring group participation. Like, if the molecule undergoes elimination and forms a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a pinacol-like elimination. Pinacol is 1,2-diol which eliminates to form a carbonyl. But in this case, it's 1,3-dibromide, not diol. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and when KOH abstracts a β-hydrogen, it leads to the formation of a carbonyl group. But that would mean each bridgehead Br is eliminated to form a ketone.

Wait, but in that case, maybe each elimination would form a ketone, but I'm not sure how that would work. Alternatively, perhaps two eliminations happen, each forming a carbonyl group. But that's not likely because each elimination would require a Br and a β-H.

Wait, maybe it's a single elimination. If the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, perhaps a single elimination would form a double bond, but given the IR, that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe an epoxide is formed? No, the IR doesn't show an epoxide peak, which is around 1200-1250 cm⁻¹ for the C-O stretch.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is more indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone.

Wait, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes elimination, maybe it forms a diketone? Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an -OH group, but that's substitution, not elimination.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the KOH is causing a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene and another reaction. But if it's a di-elimination, perhaps we get a conjugated diene. But the IR doesn't show any peaks for alkenes, which are usually around 1640-1680 cm⁻¹ for C=C.

So, the presence of the 1720 cm⁻¹ peak suggests a carbonyl. So maybe the product is a ketone. How would that form?

Wait, perhaps the base (KOH) is causing a neighboring group participation. Let me think: if the molecule is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and each Br is on a bridgehead. When KOH abstracts a β-hydrogen, perhaps it leads to the formation of a carbonyl. Wait, but bridgehead carbons are sp³, so maybe each Br is eliminated, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is removed, and the two adjacent carbons form a carbonyl group. But that would require two Brs on adjacent carbons, which I'm not sure is the case.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the two Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads. For example, in adamantane, the bridgeheads are positions 1 and 3. Hmm, but how would elimination work on that?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1,3-diketone. Because each elimination would form a ketone.

Wait, but how? Let me think about the mechanism. If two adjacent carbons each have a Br, and they undergo dehydrohalogenation, they would form a double bond. But KOH is a strong base, so elimination is favored.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and each elimination forms a bridged carbonyl group. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the NMR data. Product 1's 1H NMR shows peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is probably an -OH or an -O- group, but since it's a peak integrating for 2H, maybe it's a CH₂ group.

Wait, 4.79 ppm is around where you might see an ethylene group or perhaps an ether or an epoxide. But wait, if it's a ketone, perhaps that peak isn't from the carbonyl but maybe another group.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the product is a diene, but then why the IR shows a carbonyl?

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the overall process. Let me try to figure out each step.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid). IR has 1720 cm⁻¹ (C=O). So probably a ketone.

So, product 1 is likely a ketone. How?

Wait, perhaps the KOH is causing a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. But wait, elimination of HBr from 1,3-dibromide would form a double bond, but perhaps with two eliminations. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on adjacent carbons, and eliminating two HBr would form a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, unless the structure isn't such that the elimination leads to a ring contraction or expansion forming a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Favorskii-type elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: maybe the product is a diketone. So each Br is eliminated to form a ketone.

But how? Each Br would need to lose HBr, but would that form a ketone? Wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and eliminating HBr leads to a carbonyl group.

Wait, for example, if a bridgehead C-Br is adjacent to another bridgehead C-Br, eliminating both could form a carbonyl. But I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a non-bridgehead position. Let me think about the structure of adamantane: it's a diamond-like structure with four fused cyclohexane rings. The bridgehead positions are the ones where the rings are connected.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two bridgehead carbons. If KOH abstracts β-hydrogens, then each Br would leave, forming a double bond. But since both Brs are on bridgeheads, maybe the elimination forms a bridged diene. But that would be a conjugated diene, not a carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the IR again. 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong, typical carbonyl. So product 1 must have a ketone group.

Wait, then perhaps each Br is replaced by an O- group, but that would be substitution, which is less likely with KOH.

Wait, another possibility: the base causes a neighboring group participation, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridgehead, so elimination can form a carbonyl. For example, if a Br is on C1 and the adjacent C2 has H, eliminating HBr from C1 and C2 would form a double bond between C1 and C2, but that would be a bridgehead double bond, which is not allowed due to Bredt's rule. So perhaps that's not possible, which leads to a rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps elimination forms a carbonyl via a different mechanism. Wait, maybe it's an example of a Corey-Fuchs elimination or some other type, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone because each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group. But how? Because each Br is on a bridgehead, perhaps each elimination forms a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe each Br is on a carbon that, upon elimination, leads to a carbonyl. For example, if a Br is on a carbon that's adjacent to another carbon which can form a double bond, but that doesn't directly form a carbonyl.

I'm stuck. Let's try to think of the structure of product 1. The NMR shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 10H in the middle region suggests some sp³ carbons, perhaps in a ring structure. The 2H at 4.79 could be an OCH₂ group or something similar.

Wait, 4.79 is upfield for an OCH₂. More likely, perhaps it's a CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative atom or part of a ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Wait, if product 1 is a diketone, say, 1,3-diketone in adamantane structure, then the NMR would show certain peaks. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane derivative. No, probably not.

Wait, another approach: the IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a typical carbonyl. So product 1 is a ketone. Let me imagine it's a mono-ketone, but why would heating with KOH form a ketone from a dibromide?

Wait, perhaps it's a double elimination, but each elimination leads to a carbonyl. But how?

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridgehead, and when KOH abstracts a β hydrogen, it leads to the formation of a carbonyl group.

For example, if Br is on C1 and the adjacent C2 is a bridgehead, then elimination would form a carbonyl at C1. But wait, that would require a mechanism where Br on C1 and H on C2 are abstracted, leading to formation of a double bond, but that would be a bridgehead double bond, which isn't allowed. So perhaps the molecule rearranges to form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe each elimination forms a carbonyl, but I'm not seeing the exact mechanism.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product 1 structure. Let me consider that 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes two dehydrohalogenation reactions, each forming a ketone.

Wait, that seems unlikely because each elimination would require a H on adjacent C to Br. So, if each Br is on a bridgehead, perhaps each elimination forms a carbonyl O.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on this. Maybe I should move on to the next step and see if that gives me any clues.

Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 is a ketone, which is an acyl group. So maybe product 2 is an acylium ion or something else. Alternatively, heating a ketone with Al isopropoxide could lead to some kind of cyclization or possibly a Friedel-Crafts reaction if there's an aromatic ring, but adamantane is fully saturated, so perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, but product 1, if it's a ketone, perhaps the Al isopropoxide acts as a catalyst for some kind of ring-forming reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen or aldol condensation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought. If product 1 has a carbonyl group, heating with Al isopropoxide (which can act as a Lewis acid) might promote a cyclization. For example, if product 1 is a diketone, then under such conditions, it might undergo a cyclization to form a cyclic diketone or perhaps a lactone if there's an ester. But product 1 is a ketone, so lactone isn't likely.

Alternatively, product 2 might be an enol ether or something else, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a dienone—like a conjugated diene with ketone groups. Then, product 2 could be a cyclic structure formed via cyclization.

But I'm not making much progress here. Let me think about the ozonolysis step. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds. It breaks alkenes into carbonyl groups. So product 2 likely has a double bond, which upon ozonolysis forms two carbonyl groups.

So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR.

Wait, so product 2 has a double bond. Let me backtrack. Product 1 is a ketone (or maybe a dienone). When product 1 is heated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes some kind of elimination reaction to form a double bond, making product 2 an alkene.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 could be an enone (conjugated enone) formed via elimination, perhaps via a keto-enol tautomerism or some rearrangement.

Wait, another idea: maybe product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and heating it with Al isopropoxide leads to a dienone, which would have conjugated double bonds.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me consider that product 2 is an enol ether or some kind of conjugated diene. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bonds into carbonyl groups.

Assuming product 2 has a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. But if it's a single double bond, ozonolysis would give two carbonyls.

Now, for product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen would be near an electronegative atom, perhaps adjacent to a carbonyl group. The coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring hydrogens.

Wait, in the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded H would be near a carbonyl, perhaps on a CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl. The coupling would depend on how many neighboring Hs are there.

Let's think about the structure after ozonolysis. Suppose product 2 is a diene, say, a conjugated diene in a ring structure. Ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyl groups, possibly producing fragments.

Alternatively, maybe product 2 is a cyclic diene. Ozonolysis would open it up into a diketone.

Wait, let's imagine product 2 is a cyclopentene derivative. Ozonolysis of cyclopentene would give a diketone, but the coupling would be different.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a substituted cyclohexene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. The resulting product 3 would have carbonyl groups and perhaps some adjacent CH₂ groups.

In such a case, the H adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded and would show a specific coupling pattern.

For example, in a diketone, the Hs adjacent to the carbonyl groups would be split into doublets if they are next to one other H, or more complex patterns if more neighbors.

Wait, but considering that the initial structure is from adamantane, which is a polycyclic structure, product 2's diene might be part of a ring. Ozonolysis could break a six-membered ring into a four-membered ring with two carbonyl groups.

Wait, let's say product 2 is a bridged bicyclic diene. Ozonolysis would break the double bonds into carbonyls, leading to a structure where there are carbonyl groups at the bridgeheads.

Then, in product 3, the Hs next to the carbonyls would be deshielded. Let's say each is a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl. Each H would be adjacent to two other Hs on the same carbon and perhaps one or two on adjacent carbons.

Wait, for example, if each CH₂ is next to two Hs (on the same carbon) and one or two on the neighboring carbons. Let's think: in a structure like (CH₂)₂CO, the Hs on the CH₂ next to CO would each have two neighboring Hs on the same carbon and perhaps one on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, but in a more complex structure, maybe each H is next to two on the same carbon and one on the adjacent. So each H would be a triplet.

Wait, another scenario: the Hs are on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, with each H having two neighbors on the same carbon and one on the adjacent. Then each H would split into a triplet (each H is next to two others on the same carbon, and perhaps one on the adjacent, leading to a triplet of triplets?), but that's getting complicated.

Wait, the most deshielded H would be the ones closest to the electronegative groups. So perhaps in product 3, each of these Hs is adjacent to a carbonyl group and next to other Hs.

If each H is on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, and each H is next to two others on the same carbon and another H on the adjacent carbon, the coupling would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but let me think in terms of splitting. Each H on the CH₂ would couple with the two Hs on the same carbon (giving a triplet) and also with the Hs on the adjacent carbons.

Wait, suppose the structure is such that each CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂, each with two Hs. Then each H would couple with two Hs on the same carbon (resulting in a triplet) and with two Hs on the adjacent carbon (each from the adjacent CH₂ group). So each H would be split into a triplet of triplets (each H has two neighbors from the same carbon and two from the next, but wait, each H on a CH₂ would have two from same and perhaps two from adjacent? Or is it one from adjacent? Wait, maybe each H is next to two on the same and two on the adjacent, but that would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but another possibility is that each H is part of a CH₂ group next to another CH₂ group. So each H would have two Hs on the same carbon (J1) and two Hs on the adjacent carbon (J2). So each H would split into a triplet for J1 and a doublet for J2, leading to a triplet of doublets, but that's not an option here.

Wait, the options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs on the same carbon and two Hs on another adjacent carbon. But that would lead to more splits.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that each CH₂ is part of a geminal group. For example, imagine a structure where each CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂ group, making a chain like CH₂-CH₂. Each H on the first CH₂ would couple with two Hs on the same carbon and two Hs on the adjacent carbon. So each H would have a triplet for the same carbon and a doublet for the adjacent, leading to a triplet of doublets. But I'm not seeing that as an option.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with three others. For example, each H is part of a CH₂ group next to two other CH₂ groups, each with two Hs. That would give each H coupling with two on the same and two on each adjacent, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, but maybe the most deshielded Hs are part of a CH group, not CH₂. Wait, but 1H NMR of product 3 would show which Hs are present.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are on a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl, and each H is coupled with two Hs on the same carbon and one H on the adjacent carbon. So the splitting would be a triplet for the same carbon and a doublet for the adjacent, leading to a triplet of doublets. But none of the options match that.

Wait, another approach: The ozonolysis is done at -78°C, which is a low temperature. Ozone tends to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups without further rearrangement. So if product 2 is a simple diene, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups.

Assuming product 2 has a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, possibly leading to a diketone. But the exact structure depends on where the diene is.

Wait, but in the case of a six-membered ring with a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would break it into a four-membered ring with two ketone groups.

Wait, let's think of a cyclohexene derivative. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls, giving a 1,4-diketone in a four-membered ring, for example.

In such a case, the Hs adjacent to the carbonyls would be on either side of the rings. Each CH₂ group next to a carbonyl would have two Hs. Each H would couple with the two Hs on the same CH₂ (resulting in a triplet) and with the Hs on the adjacent CH₂ groups.

Let me imagine a structure like:

O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CO

Wait, that's a four-membered ring, but perhaps it's a straight chain. In that case, each CH₂ next to a carbonyl would have Hs that are adjacent to each other. Each H would couple with the two Hs on the same carbon (triplet) and the two Hs on the adjacent carbon (maybe a doublet), leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but for each H on the CH₂, they would have coupling with two Hs on the same carbon (so triplet) and also with two Hs on the next CH₂ (so another triplet), but wait, that's not correct. Because each H on a CH₂ would couple with two Hs on the same carbon (their geminal H and another H?), wait no, each H on a CH₂ group is coupled with the other H on the same carbon, giving a doublet. Because each H has one neighboring H on the same carbon. Wait, no, for a CH₂ group, each H is next to one H on the same carbon, so that would be a doublet.

Wait, wait. Let me correct that. For a CH₂ group, each H is adjacent to one other H on the same carbon. So each H would couple with one neighbor, resulting in a doublet. But if the adjacent carbon also has Hs, then each H would also couple with those.

Wait, for example, consider a structure like CH₂-CO-CH₂-CO. Each CH₂ is adjacent to a CO and to another CH₂. So each H on the CH₂ adjacent to CO would have coupling with the two Hs on the same CH₂ (but wait, each H is on a CH₂, so each H would have one adjacent H on the same carbon, right? Because CH₂ has two Hs, so each H is next to one H on the same carbon, leading to a doublet. Then, each H would also couple with the Hs on the adjacent CH₂.

If each H is coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH₂ (since the adjacent CH₂ has two Hs), then each H would split into a triplet. Because each H is coupled with one H on the same carbon (doublet) and two Hs on the adjacent (triplet), leading to a triplet of triplets? Or perhaps a doublet of triplets.

Wait, let me think again. For a CH₂ group next to another CH₂ group, each H in the first CH₂ would couple with the two Hs in the adjacent CH₂. So each H would have a coupling with two Hs, leading to a triplet. Additionally, each H is coupled with the other H on the same CH₂, leading to a doublet. So the splitting would be a triplet (from adjacent) and a doublet (from same), which would be a triplet of doublets. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps each H has coupling with one H on the same (doublet) and two on the adjacent (triplet), leading to a doublet of triplets. Or a triplet of doublets.

Wait, the options available are: triplet (A), triplet of triplets (B), doublet of triplets (C), pentet (D).

If each H is coupled with two Hs from the same carbon (so a triplet) and two from the adjacent (another triplet), the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, if each H is coupled with one H from the same (doublet) and two from adjacent (triplet), the result would be a doublet of triplets, which is option C.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think of a specific example.

Consider the structure where product 3 is a diketone with adjacent CH₂ groups. Let's imagine:

O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CO

The central CH₂ groups are each adjacent to a CO group and each other.

Each H on the central CH₂ groups would have:

- Coupling with the adjacent H on the same CH₂ (so one coupling, leading to a doublet).
- Coupling with the two Hs on the neighboring CH₂ group (so each H would split into a triplet).

So each H would have a doublet from the same carbon and a triplet from the adjacent. The splitting would be a triplet of doublets, but that's not an option listed. Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet of triplets, which is option C.

Alternatively, if the coupling between the same carbon is a doublet and the coupling with the adjacent is a triplet, the overall pattern would be a doublet of triplets.

Wait, but in reality, the coupling constants might be similar, making it a triplet of triplets.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is a triplet of triplets, which is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH**  
   KOH, a strong base, likely induces elimination reactions. The IR spectrum of the product (1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group. This suggests that the product is likely a ketone. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41–2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) supports a structure with a CH₂ group near a carbonyl (likely 4.79 ppm), and other hydrogens in a rigid, saturated framework.

2. **Reaction 2: Heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide**  
   Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely promotes cyclization or rearrangement. This forms product 2, which contains a double bond (based on the subsequent ozonolysis step). The exact structure of product 2 is not fully determined, but it likely involves a conjugated diene or a cyclic enone.

3. **Reaction 3: Ozonolysis of product 2**  
   Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. Product 3 will have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were in product 2. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 will be near a carbonyl group, and its coupling pattern will depend on its environment.

4. **Coupling pattern in product 3**  
   The most deshielded hydrogen is likely part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group. Each hydrogen in this CH₂ group will couple with the two hydrogens on the same carbon (resulting in a triplet) and with the two hydrogens on the adjacent carbon (also resulting in a triplet). This combination leads to a **triplet of triplets** coupling pattern.

Based on the analysis, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet of triplets**.

ANSWER: B
