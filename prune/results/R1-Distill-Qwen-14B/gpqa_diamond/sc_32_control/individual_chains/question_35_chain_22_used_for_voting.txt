Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. Alright, the question is about finding the eigenvalue and eigenvectors of the operator Ay, which is given as c times S. Oh wait, c is h over 4π, and S is a 2x2 matrix with first row 0 and -i, and second row i and 0.

Wait, I remember that the spin matrices are related to angular momentum. The Pauli matrices, maybe? Oh right, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices used in spin-1/2 systems. Let me recall, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. The σy matrix is [0 -i; i 0], right? So S here must be the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by something. Wait, no, because in the problem statement, S is given as that matrix. Oh wait, the S matrix is exactly σy. So S = σy. 

So, the operator Ay is c times S, which is (h/(4π)) * σy. So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy. 

Now, since σy is a Pauli matrix, its eigenvalues are known. The eigenvalues of any Pauli matrix are ±1, right? So, σy has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Therefore, Ay would have eigenvalues c multiplied by that, so (h/(4π)) * 1 and (h/(4π)) * (-1). So the eigenvalues a are ± h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check. Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh. Wait, no, that can't be right because the eigenvalues of Ay are real? Because the Pauli matrices have real eigenvalues. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalues of Pauli matrices are ±1, but they are real. So when you multiply by c, which is real, the eigenvalues become real. So the eigenvalues a should be (h/(4π)) and -(h/(4π)). So the eigenvalues are real, no imaginary parts. Therefore, any option that talks about imaginary parts for the eigenvalue a must be wrong.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: Imaginary parts ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Hmm, but the eigenvalues should be real. So option A must be incorrect.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real ±1. No, because from our calculation, the eigenvalues are real, not complex. So B is also wrong.

Options C and D: Let's think about them. Option C says the eigenfunction can also be an eigenfunction of A² but not of Az. Hmm. Well, for angular momentum operators, in quantum mechanics, the square of the angular momentum operator, A², commutes with all components. So if a vector is an eigenstate of Ay, then it's also an eigenstate of A², because [Ay, A²] = 0. So the eigenfunctions of Ay should be eigenfunctions of A². But what about Az? Well, [Ay, Az] is iħ A something, perhaps. Wait, in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators satisfy [Lx, Ly] = iħ Lz (or something like that). So if you have an eigenstate of Ay, it probably won't be an eigenstate of Az because they don't commute. So option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That sounds correct, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, but in this case, A is the intrinsic angular momentum, which is spin. So, the square of A (A²) is ( (ħ/2)^2 ) times identity matrix for spin-1/2 particles. Oh wait, no, because A is a vector with components Ax, Ay, Az. The square A² is Ax² + Ay² + Az², which for spin-1/2 is ( (ħ/2)^2 ) (σx² + σy² + σz² ), but each σ matrix squared is identity. So σx² is identity, same for σy and σz. So A² is (ħ²/4)(3 I) )? Wait, no, wait. Let me compute σx²: for any Pauli matrix σ, σ² is I. So σx² = I, same for σy and σz. So A² is (h/(4π))² (σx² + σy² + σz² ) = (h²/(16 π²)) (3 I). So A² has eigenvalues (3 h²)/(16 π²) times 1, so each eigenstate of A² would have that eigenvalue. But for any eigenstate of Ay, it would also be an eigenstate of A², because A² is a scalar multiple of identity (since it's 3 c² I), so yes, any vector is an eigenstate of A².

But then option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So this part seems correct. But wait, let me think about whether the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A².

Yes, because A² is a multiple of the identity matrix, so any vector is an eigenstate of A². So the eigenfunctions of Ay are indeed eigenfunctions of A², which would make option C correct in that part. But the second part of C says that they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Which is correct because Ay and Az don't commute, so their eigenfunctions are different. So I think option C is correct.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, the eigenfunctions are the basis for the operator? I'm not sure what that exactly means. The matrix operator's basis functions are the eigenvectors, but I think D is trying to say that the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator. I'm not sure. Alternatively, the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, which for a 2x2 matrix, which is diagonalizable (since Pauli matrices are diagonalizable), their eigenvectors form a basis. So the statement in D may be correct. But let me think again. The eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator in the sense that any function can be written as a combination of the eigenvectors? Well, for a 2x2 matrix, the two eigenvectors (which are orthogonal) form a basis for the vector space, so any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of them. So the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions for the operator, perhaps. Hmm, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, the matrix operator's eigenfunctions are just its eigenvectors, which for a 2x2 matrix are two in number, so they form a basis. So D seems correct, but I have to decide between C and D.

Alternatively, let's think about the process. Let's compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So Ay is [ (h/(4π)) * 0   -i (h/(4π)) ), (i (h/(4π)) ) 0 ].

Wait, no: S is [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ], and c is h/(4π), so Ay = c * S.

So Ay is [ (0)*c, (-i)*c; (i)*c, 0 ].

So,

Ay = [ [0, -i (h/(4π)) ],
        [i (h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

So, to find the eigenvalues, we solve det( Ay - a I ) = 0.

The matrix Ay - a I is:

[ -a    -i c ]
[ i c   -a ]

The determinant is ( -a )^2 - ( -i c ) (i c ) = a² - ( (-i c)(i c) )

Calculating the product: (-i c)(i c ) = (-i)(i) (c^2) )= ( (-i^2) ) c². Since i^2 = -1, so (-i)(i)= (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So it's (1) c². So determinant is a² - c² =0 ⇒ a² = c² ⇒ a= ±c. So the eigenvalues are +c and -c. So c is h/(4π), so a= ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real, as I thought earlier.

The eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors.

For a = +c: solving (Ay - c I) v =0.

The matrix becomes:

[ -c   -i c ]
[ i c  -c ]

So each row is:

- c v1 - i c v2 =0 → -v1 -i v2 =0 → v1 = -i v2.

So the eigenvector for a=+c is proportional to [ -i, 1 ]^T.

Similarly, for a= -c:

Matrix is [ c   -i c; i c  c ]

Equation: c v1 - i c v2 =0 → v1 = (i v2 )

So eigenvector is [ i, 1 ]^T.

So the eigenfunctions are [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ].

Wait, now, considering that S is the Pauli Y matrix, and c is a real constant, so Ay is a Hermitian operator. So it has real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors. So the eigenvectors are orthogonal.

Now, the eigenfunctions are these two vectors. So the eigenfunctions form a basis for the two-dimensional space, which is the basis for the matrix operator Ay. So option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That makes sense, since any 2x2 matrix can be expressed in terms of its eigenvectors as a basis. So D could be correct.

But earlier, I thought option C was correct. Let me re-examine the options.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

We know that A² is [ (h/(4π))² (σx² + σy² + σz²) ] = (h²/(16 π²)) (3 I ), since each Pauli matrix squared is I. So A² is a multiple of the identity matrix. Therefore, any vector is an eigenstate of A². So the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So the first part of C is correct.

As for whether they are eigenfunctions of Az: Az is another component of the angular momentum. Since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenfunctions are different. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So the second part of C is correct. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, what does "basis functions of the matrix operator" mean? The operator is a 2x2 matrix, which acts on a two-dimensional space. The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for this space. So yes, they are the basis functions. So D is correct as well.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So the options are all possible statements, and only one is correct.

So if both C and D are correct, but looking again, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let's re-examine the options:

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

Yes, that's correct because A² commutes with Ay, so eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², and they don't commute with Az, so they are not eigenfunctions of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. The eigenfunctions form an orthonormal basis for the vector space that the operator acts on. So any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of these eigenfunctions. So the eigenfunctions are a basis for the space, which is the same as being a basis for the operator's matrix representation. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question asks which statement is correct. So both C and D could be correct. But looking at the options, perhaps D is correct because the eigenvectors are the basis for the operator. But wait, the operator is a 2x2 matrix, so its eigenvectors form a basis, which is why any vector can be expressed in terms of them. So D is correct.

Wait, but I thought C was also correct. So which one is the correct answer?

Looking back, the question is about which statement is correct.

Another approach: let's compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real. So any option that includes imaginary parts in the eigenvalues (like A and B) is incorrect. So only options C and D are possible.

Now, for the options, let's look at their content.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

As discussed, A² eigenvalues are same for all since it's a multiple of identity. So correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

Hmm, perhaps D is correct as well, but let's think about the wording. The eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, so any vector can be written in terms of them. So the statements in C and D are both correct.

Wait, but the options are exclusive; only one can be correct.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but I need to see what each option says.

Wait, another point: the matrix S is given as [0 -i; i 0], which is the Pauli Y matrix. So Ay = c S.

In quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of S are the same as the eigenstates of Ay, because c is a scalar. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are the same as those of S. So the eigenvectors are the same.

Now, for the Pauli matrices, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are spin-up and spin-down states along the y-axis. So for spin-1/2 systems, the eigenstates of S (and thus Ay) are the same as those of any component that commutes with it. But since Ay doesn't commute with Az, the eigenfunctions won't be those of Az.

So, regarding option C: the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Correct.

Regarding option D: the eigenfunctions form the basis of the operator. Correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps D is correct because the eigenvectors are the basis.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvectors don't form a basis for the operator's matrix. Wait, the eigenvectors are a basis for the space on which the operator acts. So any operator on a finite-dimensional space can be diagonalized in its eigenbasis.

So D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That makes sense.

But then, why is C an option? Because it's correct as well.

Wait, but in option C, the statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options only allow one correct answer. But the options only have one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps looking back, I made a mistake in computing the eigenvalues.

Wait, let me re-calculate the eigenvalues.

Ay is given by c * S, where S is [0 -i; i 0]. So to find the eigenvalues of Ay, since S has eigenvalues ±1, Ay's eigenvalues would be c * 1 and c * (-1), so ±c = ±h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), real numbers. So any option saying the eigenvalues have imaginary parts is wrong. So options A and B are out.

Now, the eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors of Ay, which are the same as those of S. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator, so option D is correct.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Well, A² is a multiple of identity, so any eigenfunction is an eigenfunction of A². But the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az, since they don't commute. So option C is correct.

Wait, but the question is asking which statement is correct. So which of the options (C or D) is correct. Now, to determine which is correct, perhaps I need to think about the properties.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. So that's correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Which is also correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

Hmm, but perhaps the matrix operator's basis is not necessarily the same as the eigenfunctions. Wait, the matrix representation in the eigenbasis would be diagonal. So the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator, yes.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps during calculation, which statement is correct.

Wait, the eigenfunctions of Ay will be the same as eigenfunctions of S, which are the spin-up and spin-down along y.

Now, for option D, the statement is that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. I think that's correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so any vector can be written in terms of them.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But wait, the options are multiple-choice, so only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me read the options again.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, the matrix operator's basis functions might refer to the functions used to represent the operator as a matrix. For instance, if you choose a basis, say, the standard basis, then the matrix representation is in terms of those basis vectors. But the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are a different basis. So if the question is whether the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator, perhaps it's correct because they form the eigenbasis for Ay, which is a basis.

Alternatively, perhaps D is correct because the operator Ay is represented in the basis of its eigenfunctions as a diagonal matrix. So the eigenfunctions are the basis for the operator's matrix representation.

Hmm, but the question is phrased as whether the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. So I think D is correct.

But wait, the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking back, the options can't both be correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the exact wording. The statement in option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator's matrix. But the matrix is already in a particular basis. So perhaps the eigenvectors are not the basis for the matrix, but the matrix is expressed in the standard basis or another basis. Hmm, this is getting a bit fuzzy.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because in the calculation, when you find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, you can use the fact that the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

But I'm getting stuck between C and D.

Wait, let me think about each option again.

Option C: Eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Yes, correct because A² commutes with Ay, so any eigenfunction of Ay is an eigenfunction of A². And since Az doesn't commute with Ay, the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

This also seems correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space, which is the domain of the operator.

So perhaps both statements are correct, but looking back, the options are multiple-choice, and only one is correct. So I must have made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the operator Ay is 2x2, so it's a 2-level system. Its eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are two in number and orthogonal. Hence, they form a basis for the vector space. So option D is correct.

But then why is option C correct? Because it's also true.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C, but I'm getting confused. Another approach: which of the options are incorrect.

Looking again, the options:

A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real ±h/(4π) → wrong because eigenvalues are real.

B: Imaginary parts ±½, real ±1 → wrong.

C: Correct as discussed.

D: Also correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but how can both C and D be correct? Because the question is a multiple-choice, and only one option is correct, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, let's think again: the matrix operator's eigenfunctions are the basis. So when you have a matrix operator, the choice of basis affects how it's represented. The eigenvectors form a diagonalizing basis, so in that basis, the matrix is diagonal. So the eigenfunctions are the basis for that particular representation. So yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator in that representation. So D is correct.

Now, I'm torn between C and D. Both seem correct. But perhaps only one is an option.

Looking back, the question says "which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation?" So during the calculation, perhaps you first find the eigenvalues, which are real, and then the eigenfunctions, which form the basis. So perhaps during the calculation, you find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and conclude that the eigenfunctions form the basis. So option D would be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps during the calculation, you realize that the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² because you can calculate A² and see it's a multiple of identity, making any function an eigenfunction.

So perhaps, the correct answer is option C.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct. So perhaps the correct statement is that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves analyzing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix given by:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvalues of the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix \( S \) are \( \pm 1 \).
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - These eigenvalues are real, so any option suggesting imaginary parts for the eigenvalues (e.g., options A and B) is incorrect.

2. **Eigenfunctions of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the eigenvectors of \( S \), which are orthogonal and form a basis for the two-dimensional space.
   - These eigenfunctions are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \) (the \( Z \)-component of angular momentum) because \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute.

3. **Option C:**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \) and is a multiple of the identity matrix. Thus, any eigenfunction of \( A_y \) is also an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \).
   - However, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \) because \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute.

4. **Option D:**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is correct because the eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form an orthonormal basis for the two-dimensional space on which \( A_y \) acts. Any vector in this space can be expressed as a linear combination of these eigenfunctions.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Both options C and D are correct based on the analysis. However, since the question asks for a single correct statement, option C is chosen because it highlights the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), which is more directly relevant to the eigenvalue problem being solved.

ANSWER: C
