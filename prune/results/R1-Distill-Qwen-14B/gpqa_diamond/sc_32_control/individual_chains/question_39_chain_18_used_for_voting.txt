Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it out.

Alright, the question says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that can move along a tube (x-axis). The wave function of each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. When they measure the position, none of the particles are found outside x=1 to x=3. So we're told that the wave function exists only between x=1 and x=3. We need to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, wait. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalized. That means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. Because the probability of finding the particle somewhere is 100%.

So the wave function ψ(x) is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but the wave function can have an imaginary part, right? Because the wave functions can be complex. But when we compute the probability, we take the absolute square, which involves ψ*ψ, so the imaginary parts would contribute.

But wait, the question says that none were found at x <1 or x>3. That probably means that the wave function is zero outside this region. Oh, but the given wave function isn't zero outside; it's given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i in a part of space where the particle exists, which is between x=1 and x=3. Or wait, the way the question is phrased, the wave function is defined as that expression in the region where the particle exists, which is between 1 and 3. So outside, the wave function is zero.

Wait, no, the way the question is written: "the wave function [...] of each particle, in a part of space where it can exist, can be described as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i". So the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So the normalization integral should only be from x=1 to x=3.

So to normalize ψ, the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx should equal 1.

Let me write down ψ(x). ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i. So the complex conjugate ψ*(x) is [a / sqrt(1 + x)] + 0.5i.

So |ψ(x)|² is ψ*ψ. Let me compute that:

|ψ|^2 = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2 + [a/(sqrt(1+x))]*0.5i*(-i)*2 ? Wait, no, wait. Actually, the product of ψ* and ψ is [a/(sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i] * [a/(sqrt(1+x)) +0.5i]. Let me compute that.

Multiplying the two terms:

= [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (a/(sqrt(1+x)))*(0.5i) - (0.5i)*(a/(sqrt(1+x))) ) - (0.5i)^2.

Wait, no, a better way is to use (A + B)(A - B) = A² - B² when dealing with complex numbers, but wait, no, because B is imaginary. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, actually, the product is [a/(sqrt)] * [a/(sqrt)] + [a/(sqrt)]*(0.5i) + (-0.5i)*(a/(sqrt)) + (-0.5i)*(0.5i).

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute as (a/(sqrt(1+x)) )^2 + (0.5)^2, because the imaginary parts might cancel out. Let me see:

Let me denote A = a/(sqrt(1+x)), B = 0.5i.

Then ψ = A - B, so ψ* = A + B.

So ψ*ψ = (A - B)(A + B) = A² + AB - AB - B² = A² - B².

Wait, because AB - AB cancels, and we have A² - B².

So ψ*ψ = (a²)/(1 + x) - (0.5i)^2. But because B is imaginary, B² is (0.5i)^2 = (0.25)(i²) = -0.25.

So ψ*ψ = (a²)/(1 + x) - (-0.25) = (a²)/(1 + x) + 0.25.

So the integrand becomes (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, that's interesting. So |ψ(x)|² is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me split the integral into two parts:

Integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 + Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Compute each integral separately.

First integral: a² * ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|. Evaluated from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2).

So first integral is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25*(3 -1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So total integral: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So equation becomes a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Solving for a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute 0.5 / ln(2):

ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function in quantum mechanics. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the absolute square of the wave function, \( |\psi(x)|^2 \). Expanding this:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition requires that the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over the region where the particle exists (from \( x=1 \) to \( x=3 \)) equals 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \)
2. \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \)

For the first integral, the antiderivative of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln|1+x| \). Evaluating this from \( x=1 \) to \( x=3 \):

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

For the second integral:

\[
\int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
\]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Rearranging for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately 0.85, which corresponds to option **B**.
