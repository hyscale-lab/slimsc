Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. 

Alright, let's read the problem again. We have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 200 mL. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so I don't think it affects much here. The Ka values for H3PO4 are given as Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, and Ka3=1.8e-12. 

Wait, I remember that phosphate ions can exist in different forms depending on the pH. The species can be H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. The problem is asking for orthophosphate ions, which I think are HPO4^2- and PO4^3-? Or wait, maybe orthophosphate is H3PO4, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, orthophosphate might refer to the HPO4^2- form. Hmm, I need to clarify that. Let me think, in the context of buffers and dissociation, orthophosphate is usually the HPO4^2- species. Or maybe it refers to the free H3PO4, but I think in this problem, it's the HPO4^2- concentration we're looking for.

Wait, the problem says 'orthophosphate ions'—orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, but when it loses a proton, it becomes H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), then HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate, or orthophosphate?), and then PO4^3- (phosphate). So orthophosphate is HPO4^2- perhaps. So the question is about [HPO4^2-].

But wait, the solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me think about their dissociation. 

KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So, KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. It dissolves into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So, Na2HPO4 → 2 Na+ + HPO4^2-.

Wait, so in the solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. That makes me think of a buffer solution. Because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-.

So, the mixture of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 would form a buffer solution. The pH of the solution can be determined using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, and knowing that, we can find the concentration of HPO4^2-.

But wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Let me see. If orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, then the concentration would just be the concentration contributed by Na2HPO4. But wait, that's not right because in solution, some of the H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 will dissociate, and some of the HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4 will accept protons to form H2PO4^-. So the concentrations will be in equilibrium.

Wait, no. Actually, when you mix H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, they form a buffer. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

Since both salts contribute to the concentrations of these ions, the ratio of their concentrations depends on the amounts of each salt added.

So, first, let's calculate the moles of each component.

Molar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00735 mol. Because 1/136.09 is about 0.00735. Let me compute that more accurately. 1 ÷ 136.09 ≈ 0.007347 mol.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O has a molar mass of 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005617 mol. Because 1 divided by 177.99 is approximately 0.005617.

So, from KH2PO4, we get 0.007347 moles of H2PO4^-.

From Na2HPO4, we get 0.005617 moles of HPO4^2-.

The total volume is 200 mL, which is 0.2 L.

So initial concentrations before any dissociation would be:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007347 / 0.2 = 0.036735 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005617 / 0.2 = 0.028085 M.

Wait, but that's the initial concentration from the salts. However, in solution, these species can interconvert. So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation will help find the pH, and then we can find the actual concentrations.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- (since it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-), and the base is HPO4^2-.

So the relevant pKa is Ka2 of H3PO4, which is 6.2e-8. The pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)) = approximately 7.2075.

So, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

We can plug in the concentrations from the salts:

pH = 7.2075 + log(0.028085 / 0.036735)

Let me compute that ratio: 0.028085 / 0.036735 ≈ 0.765.

Log(0.765) is about -0.115.

So pH = 7.2075 - 0.115 ≈ 7.0925.

Now that I have the pH, I can find the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait. Since the solution is a buffer, the ratio of base to acid is determined by the initial amounts. So perhaps I should compute the concentrations using the Henderson equation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the buffer equation and calculate the actual concentration of HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way.

Wait, but I'm not being asked about the pH. I'm being asked about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, then I need to find [HPO4^2-].

But in the buffer, the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are related by the Henderson equation. So, perhaps I can express [HPO4^2-] in terms of [H2PO4^-].

Wait, but in this case, both ions are present, so their concentrations are fixed by the initial moles and the pH.

Wait, no. The Henderson equation relates their ratio, but their absolute concentrations depend on the buffer capacity. Hmm, but perhaps I can find their concentrations using the initial moles and the pH.

Alternatively, perhaps the concentration of HPO4^2- can be found by considering the buffer equation.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the system using the equilibrium.

The equilibrium is H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+.

The Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is about 7.2075, as calculated before.

In the solution, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are determined by the buffer equation.

Let me let [H2PO4^-] = a, and [HPO4^2-] = b.

From the buffer equation, pH = pKa2 + log(b/a).

But also, the total concentration of these two species is a + b = total phosphate concentration, which is (moles from KH2PO4 + moles from Na2HPO4) / volume.

Wait, no, because KH2PO4 contributes H2PO4^- and Na2HPO4 contributes HPO4^2-. So the initial amounts are 0.007347 mol H2PO4^- and 0.005617 mol HPO4^2-.

Wait, but in solution, some H2PO4^- will dissociate into HPO4^2- and some HPO4^2- will protonate into H2PO4^-.

So the actual concentrations are a and b, but a + b would be the sum of the initial moles plus any changes from dissociation.

Wait, no, because the solution is a buffer, and the total concentration is (a + b) = (moles of H2PO4^- + moles of HPO4^2-)/volume.

Wait, but the initial moles are 0.007347 and 0.005617, sum is 0.012964 mol. Divided by 0.2 L, that's 0.06482 M.

So a + b = 0.06482 M.

And from Henderson equation:

pH = 7.2075 + log(b/a) → log(b/a) = pH - 7.2075.

So if I can find the pH, which I calculated as approximately 7.0925, then:

log(b/a) = 7.0925 - 7.2075 = -0.115.

So b/a = 10^(-0.115) ≈ 0.765.

So b = 0.765 a.

Now, a + b = 0.06482.

Substituting, a + 0.765 a = 0.06482 → 1.765 a = 0.06482 → a ≈ 0.06482 / 1.765 ≈ 0.03666 M.

Then b = 0.765 * 0.03666 ≈ 0.02808 M.

Wait, that's interesting. So the [HPO4^2-] is 0.02808 M, which is the same as the initial concentration from Na2HPO4. But that can't be right because some of the H2PO4^- would convert to HPO4^2-, and some HPO4^2- would convert to H2PO4^-.

Wait, but maybe because the initial concentrations are such that the ratio is already the same as the Henderson ratio. So perhaps the initial concentrations are in the ratio that the solution is at equilibrium. So maybe the actual concentrations don't change, and the [HPO4^2-] is 0.028085 M.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the Henderson equation relates the ratio, but the actual concentrations would depend on the pH.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The total concentration of phosphate species is the sum of H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

But in this solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because the pH is around 7.1, which is close to pKa2 (~7.2). So H3PO4 is negligible, and PO4^3- is also negligible because the pH is lower than pKa3 (which is around 12. So HPO4^2- is the dominant species, but some H2PO4^- is present.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-, then I just need to find [HPO4^2-].

But from the Henderson equation, [HPO4^2-] is related to [H2PO4^-] via the pH.

Wait, but how do I get the exact concentration?

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is simply the sum of the initial contributions from each salt because they are in a buffer, and the dissociation is already accounted for. But that can't be right because some H2PO4^- would dissociate into HPO4^2- and some HPO4^2- would accept protons to become H2PO4^-.

Hmm, maybe I can model this using the initial moles and the Ka expression.

Let me consider that the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The equilibrium is:

H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+

The Ka for this reaction is Ka2 = 6.2e-8.

The initial concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.036735 M (from KH2PO4)
[HPO4^2-] = 0.02808 M (from Na2HPO4)

Let x be the change in concentration of H2PO4^- that dissociates into HPO4^2-. So:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.036735 - x
[HPO4^2-] = 0.02808 + x

But the change might be small because Ka2 is small (1e-7 order), so x might be small. Let me check.

Ka = [HPO4^2-][H+]/[H2PO4^-]

But [H+] can be found using pH. Earlier, I calculated pH ≈7.09, so [H+] = 10^(-7.09) ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

Wait, but I can also write:

Ka2 = ( [HPO4^2-] [H+] ) / [H2PO4^-]

So rearranged:

[HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-]) / [H+]

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can plug in the values I have.

Wait, but [H+] is known from pH, which I have as approximately 7.09.

So, [H+] ≈ 1e-7.09 ≈ 8.21e-8.

So, plug into the Ka2 expression:

Ka2 = [HPO4^2-][H+]/[H2PO4^-]

Rearranged:

[HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = Ka2 / [H+] = (6.2e-8) / (8.21e-8) ≈ 0.755.

Which is close to what I had before (0.765), which makes sense.

So, [HPO4^2-] = 0.755 [H2PO4^-]

But how does that help me find the actual concentration?

Wait, the total phosphate concentration is [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] = (0.036735 - x) + (0.02808 + x) ) = 0.036735 + 0.02808 = 0.064815 M.

But wait, that's the same as before because x cancels out. So maybe the ratio is the only thing that matters.

So, from the ratio:

[HPO4^2-] = 0.755 [H2PO4^-]

And the sum is 0.064815 M.

So, [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] = 0.064815.

Let me substitute:

[H2PO4^-] + 0.755 [H2PO4^-] = 0.064815 → 1.755 [H2PO4^-] = 0.064815 → [H2PO4^-] = 0.064815 / 1.755 ≈ 0.03693 M.

Then, [HPO4^2-] = 0.755 * 0.03693 ≈ 0.02793 M.

Wait, but that's very close to the initial concentration of 0.02808 M. So maybe the initial approximation is correct, and the actual [HPO4^2-] is about 0.028 M.

Wait, but that's confusing because the initial [HPO4^2-] was 0.02808 M, and in the calculation, it's 0.02793 M, which is very close. So perhaps the change is minimal, and the initial concentrations are a good approximation.

But why would that be? Because the solution is a buffer, and the concentrations don't change much upon dissociation.

So, perhaps the [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.028 M, which is 2.8e-2 M.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, the highest option is 6.24e-7 M, which is way lower than 0.028 M. So that can't be right.

Wait, wait a minute, I'm seeing a big mistake here. Oh no! I think I messed up the exponents. Because 0.028 M is 2.8e-2 M, but the options are in the 1e-7 range. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Hmm, why is this happening? Let me go back.

Wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Wait, perhaps orthophosphate refers to H3PO4, not HPO4^2-. But H3PO4 is a weak acid and would be in very low concentration, given that the solution is at pH 7.09.

Alternatively, perhaps orthophosphate refers to the HPO4^2- ion, but I'm getting a concentration that's way higher than any of the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let me re-examine my calculations.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in how I calculated the moles. Let me recalculate the moles.

Molar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007347 mol.

Similarly, for Na2HPO4·2H2O: molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So 1.00 g /177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005617 mol.

So in 200 mL (0.2 L), the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007347 / 0.2 = 0.036735 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005617 / 0.2 = 0.028085 M.

So the initial concentrations are 0.036735 M and 0.028085 M.

Wait, but when I applied the Henderson equation, I found that [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.028 M, which is the initial value. So perhaps the answer is about 0.028 M, which is 2.8e-2 M, but the options are much lower. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding what the question is asking for.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for [PO4^3-], which would be the concentration of phosphate ions, PO4^3-.

Wait, but in the solution, PO4^3- is very low because the pH is 7.09, which is much lower than pKa3 (12). So PO4^3- would be negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps orthophosphate refers to H3PO4, which would be even lower.

Wait, but H3PO4 is a weak acid and would dissociate in water. But at pH 7.09, most of it would be H2PO4^-.

Hmm, maybe the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- ions, but I'm not getting an answer that matches the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson equation. Let me re-examine that.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- (can donate a proton), and the base is HPO4^2- (can accept a proton). So the equation is correct.

pKa2 is 7.2075.

pH is 7.0925.

So, log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]) = 7.0925 - 7.2075 = -0.115.

Which gives [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^-0.115 ≈ 0.765.

So, [HPO4^2-] = 0.765 * [H2PO4^-].

The sum of their concentrations is 0.036735 + 0.028085 = 0.06482 M.

Wait, no. Wait, the sum is:

[H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] = total phosphate concentration = (0.007347 + 0.005617) / 0.2 = 0.012964 / 0.2 = 0.06482 M.

So, [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] = 0.06482.

Let me let [H2PO4^-] = a, [HPO4^2-] = 0.765 a.

So, a + 0.765 a = 0.06482 → 1.765 a = 0.06482 → a = 0.06482 / 1.765 ≈ 0.03668 M.

Then, [HPO4^2-] = 0.765 * 0.03668 ≈ 0.02808 M.

Wait, that's the same as the initial [HPO4^2-] from Na2HPO4. So perhaps the initial concentrations are correct, and the buffer doesn't cause much change because the solution is already at the right pH.

But why are the answer options so much lower? The options are all around 1e-7 M, which is way lower than 0.028 M.

Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating the concentration.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering that the solution's pH affects the ionization of HPO4^2- into PO4^3- and H+.

Wait, because HPO4^2- can also dissociate:

HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is much smaller than Ka2. So at pH 7.09, which is much higher than pKa3 (which is about 12), so the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low.

So, [PO4^3-] ≈ (Ka3 [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

But again, [H+] is 1e-7.09 ≈ 8.21e-8.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / 8.21e-8 ≈ (5.05e-14) / 8.21e-8 ≈ 6.15e-7 M.

Wait a minute, that's 6.15e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7 M) or D (3.97e-7 M). Hmm.

But wait, the question is about orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is PO4^3-, then the concentration is about 6.15e-7 M. That would match option A.

Alternatively, if orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-, then the concentration is 0.028 M, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps the question is asking for [PO4^3-], the concentration of phosphate ions, which is very low.

So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate [PO4^3-], which would use the third dissociation.

Wait, but how?

Let me think: The solution contains HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- as the main species. The HPO4^2- can dissociate into PO4^3- and H+.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12. The pH is 7.09.

So, the concentration of PO4^3- can be calculated using the expression:

Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-].

So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

We have [HPO4^2-] = 0.02808 M, [H+] = 8.21e-8.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / 8.21e-8.

Calculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02808 ≈ 5.0544e-14.

Divide by 8.21e-8: 5.0544e-14 / 8.21e-8 = approximately 6.157e-7 M.

Which is about 6.16e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is very close.

But wait, let me check the exact calculation.

Compute 1.8e-12 * 0.02808:

1.8e-12 * 0.02808 = (1.8 * 0.02808) * 1e-12 = 0.050544e-12 = 5.0544e-14.

Divide by [H+] = 8.21e-8.

5.0544e-14 / 8.21e-8 = (5.0544 / 8.21) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.6156 * 1e-6 = 6.156e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.16e-7 M. The closest option is A) 6.24e-7 M. Hmm, it's a little off. But perhaps I made a slight approximation in the [H+] calculation.

Wait, what's the exact [H+] at pH 7.0925? Let's compute it more accurately.

pH = 7.0925 → [H+] = 10^(-7.0925) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0925).

10^(-0.0925) is approximately 0.8208. Because log(0.8208)= -0.0925.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.8208 = 8.208e-8 M.

Now, compute [PO4^3-]:

(1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / 8.208e-8.

1.8e-12 * 0.02808 = 5.0544e-14.

5.0544e-14 / 8.208e-8 = (5.0544 / 8.208) * 1e-6.

5.0544 ÷8.208 ≈ 0.6158.

So 0.6158e-6 = 6.158e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.16e-7 M. Option A is 6.24e-7, which is a bit higher. So perhaps my initial approximation for the pH was a little off.

Wait, let me recalculate the pH more accurately.

The Henderson equation was pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)) = log(1.6129e7) → wait, no, wait, pKa = -log(Ka). So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.2075.

The ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02808 / 0.036735 ≈ 0.765.

So log(0.765) = log(7.65e-1) → approximately -0.115.

So pH = 7.2075 - 0.115 = 7.0925.

So [H+] is 10^(-7.0925) = 8.208e-8.

So, the calculation of [PO4^3-] is 6.158e-7 M.

The closest option is A) 6.24e-7 M. Hmm, perhaps I should consider more precise calculations.

Wait, let me compute the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] more accurately.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005617 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028085 M.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007347 mol / 0.2 L = 0.036735 M.

Ratio = 0.028085 / 0.036735 = 0.7651.

Log(0.7651) = ?

Using a calculator, log(0.7651) ≈ -0.1148.

So pH = 7.2075 -0.1148 = 7.0927.

[H+] = 10^(-7.0927) → let me compute that accurately.

7.0927 → 7 + 0.0927.

10^(-0.0927) = approximately 0.8204.

So [H+] = 8.204e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / (8.204e-8).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = 5.0553e-14.

Divide by denominator: 5.0553e-14 /8.204e-8 = (5.0553 /8.204) * 1e-6.

5.0553 ÷8.204 ≈ 0.6162.

So 0.6162e-6 = 6.162e-7 M.

Still about 6.16e-7 M.

Looking at the options, the closest one is A) 6.24e-7, which is a bit higher. But perhaps there's a miscalculation in the original steps.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the initial moles.

Let me recheck the moles.

KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol.

136.09 = 136.09.

1/136.09 ≈ 0.007347 mol.

Yes.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g /177.99 g/mol.

1/177.99 ≈ 0.005617 mol.

So that's correct.

So [HPO4^2-] is 0.028085 M.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when HPO4^2- dissociates, it produces a small amount of PO4^3-.

But what about the contribution from H2PO4^- dissociating into HPO4^2-?

Wait, the H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-.

The equilibrium for that is:

H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+.

Ka2 =6.2e-8.

So the [HPO4^2-] from this reaction would be (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-])/ [H+].

Wait, using the same [H+] as before, 8.204e-8.

So [HPO4^2-] from H2PO4^- dissociation = (6.2e-8 * 0.036735) / (8.204e-8).

Calculate numerator:6.2e-8 *0.036735 ≈ 2.273e-9.

Divide by denominator: 2.273e-9 /8.204e-8 ≈ 0.02774 M.

Wait, that's about 0.02774 M, which is less than the initial [HPO4^2-] of 0.028085 M.

So the change is minimal, about 0.000345 M.

So the [HPO4^2-] remains approximately 0.028 M, and the [PO4^3-] is around 6.16e-7 M.

But that's not matching any of the options exactly. The options are A) 6.24e-7, B)5.48e-7, C)2.81e-7, D)3.97e-7.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is that I used [HPO4^2-] from Na2HPO4, but in reality, the solution's [HPO4^2-] is higher due to some H2PO4^- dissociating.

Wait, let me think: The initial [HPO4^2-] is 0.028085 M, and some H2PO4^- (0.036735 M) dissociates into HPO4^2-.

The amount dissociated x can be calculated from the Ka expression.

Ka2 = [HPO4^2-][H+]/[H2PO4^-].

Let me let x be the increase in [HPO4^2-] due to dissociation.

So, [HPO4^2-] = 0.028085 + x.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.036735 - x.

But since Ka2 is small, x would be small compared to 0.028085 and 0.036735.

So, approximate [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.028085 + x.

[H2PO4^-] ≈ 0.036735 - x ≈ 0.036735.

So,

Ka2 ≈ ( (0.028085 + x) * [H+] ) / 0.036735.

But since x is small, 0.028085 + x ≈0.028085.

So,

Ka2 ≈ (0.028085 * [H+]) / 0.036735.

We can solve for [H+]?

Wait, no, because [H+] is determined by pH, which we've already calculated. But perhaps this approach is getting me stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should set up the equation correctly without approximation.

Ka2 = ( [HPO4^2-] [H+} ) / [H2PO4^-}.

We can express [HPO4^2-] = 0.028085 + x.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.036735 - x.

But since x is small, let's assume x is much smaller than 0.036735 and 0.028085, so [HPO4^2-]≈0.028085, [H2PO4^-]≈0.036735.

Then,

Ka2 ≈ (0.028085 * [H+] ) / 0.036735.

Solve for [H+]:

[H+] ≈ (Ka2 * 0.036735) / 0.028085.

Ka2 is 6.2e-8.

So,

[H+] ≈ (6.2e-8 * 0.036735) / 0.028085 → (2.273e-9) / 0.028085 ≈ 8.1e-8 M.

Which matches our earlier calculation of [H+] ≈8.2e-8 M. So that approach holds.

Now, to find [PO4^3-], we can use the Ka3 expression.

Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-}.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-}) / [H+}.

= (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / (8.2e-8).

= (5.055e-14) / (8.2e-8) ≈ 6.16e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.16e-7 M, close to option A (6.24e-7 M).

Wait, but why is the option a little higher than our calculation? Could there be a miscalculation?

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately.

Let me compute 1.8e-12 * 0.028085:

= 1.8 * 0.028085 = 0.050553 → 0.050553e-12 = 5.0553e-14.

Divide by 8.204e-8:

5.0553e-14 /8.204e-8 = (5.0553 /8.204) * 1e-6.

5.0553 ÷8.204 = 0.6162.

So, 0.6162e-6 = 6.162e-7 M.

Which is 6.162e-7 M.

The option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is 0.0000624 M. So the calculated value is 6.16e-7, which is very close.

But perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the exact concentration considering all possible sources.

Wait, another approach: The total concentration of all phosphate species is the sum of H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

But at pH 7.09, H3PO4 is negligible because its pKa1 is around 2.1, so it's mostly deprotonated. H2PO4^- is the dominant species in the first dissociation, but since we have a mix of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the buffer is established.

Wait, but in any case, the concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the third dissociation, which is very small.

So, the concentration of PO4^3- is approximately 6.16e-7 M, which is very close to option A.

But looking at the options, option D is 3.97e-7 M. So why isn't that the answer?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the Ka3 and the variables.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.028085 M.

[H+] is 8.204e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / 8.204e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = 5.0553e-14.

Divide by denominator: 5.0553e-14 / 8.204e-8 = 5.0553 /8.204e-6 → 0.6162e-6 = 6.162e-7.

Which is 6.16e-7, which is 6.16 x10^-7 M.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A) 6.24e-7 M.

But another thought: Perhaps the problem is about the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution, which is 0.028 M, but that's way higher than any option. So perhaps the question is actually asking about [HPO4^2-], but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question.

Wait, the question asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-, then the answer would be approximately 0.028 M, but that's not any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- ions, which is 6.16e-7 M, which is close to option A.

But another thing I'm thinking: Did I mix up the Ka values? Let me check the given Ka values.

The question states: Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, Ka3=1.8e-12.

So I used Ka2=6.2e-8 correctly for the buffer, and Ka3=1.8e-12 for the third dissociation.

So, the calculation for [PO4^3-] is correct.

But the options don't have 6.16e-7. The closest is option A:6.24e-7.

Alternatively, perhaps I should round it to 6.2e-7, but the options list A as 6.24e-7, which is very close.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation with more precise numbers.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = 5.0553e-14.

Denominator: [H+] = 8.204e-8.

5.0553e-14 /8.204e-8 = (5.0553 /8.204) * 1e-6.

5.0553 ÷8.204 ≈ 0.6162.

So 0.6162e-6 = 6.162e-7 M.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, as it's the closest.

But wait, I have another thought: Maybe the orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-, and the problem is asking for its concentration, but because the solution is a buffer, the exact concentration isn't just the initial moles but adjusted based on the pH.

Wait, but earlier calculations show that the [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.028 M, which is way higher than any of the options. So perhaps the problem is indeed asking for [PO4^3-], which is about 6.16e-7 M.

But then why is option D 3.97e-7 M? That's about 63% of my calculation. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I should consider the contribution from both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- dissociating into PO4^3-.

Wait, H2PO4^- can dissociate into HPO4^2- and H+, and HPO4^2- can dissociate into PO4^3- and H+.

So, the [PO4^3-] would come from both sources.

Wait, but the contribution from H2PO4^- is negligible because it's two steps away. Let me see.

The second dissociation (HPO4^2- → PO4^3- + H+) is much stronger than the third dissociation, which is the one we're considering.

Wait, no, the third dissociation is HPO4^2- → PO4^3- + H+ with Ka3=1.8e-12.

So, the contribution from H2PO4^- to PO4^3- would be through two dissociations: H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- → PO4^3-.

But since each step has a small Ka, the overall contribution would be (Ka2 * Ka3 * [H2PO4^-]) / ([H+]^2).

Which is probably very small compared to the contribution from HPO4^2-.

Let me compute that.

[PO4^3-] from H2PO4^-:

= (Ka2 * Ka3 * [H2PO4^-}) / ([H+]^2).

So,

Ka2=6.2e-8, Ka3=1.8e-12, [H2PO4^-]=0.036735, [H+]=8.204e-8.

= (6.2e-8 * 1.8e-12 * 0.036735 ) / (8.204e-8)^2.

Compute numerator: 6.2e-8 *1.8e-12 = 1.116e-19. Multiply by 0.036735: 1.116e-19 *0.036735 ≈4.106e-21.

Denominator: (8.204e-8)^2 = 6.73e-15.

So [PO4^3-] from H2PO4^-: 4.106e-21 /6.73e-15 ≈6.098e-7 M.

Wait, that's about 6.1e-7 M, which is the same as the contribution from HPO4^2-.

Wait, that can't be right because that would suggest that [PO4^3-] is about 1.2e-6 M, which is higher than any of the options.

But wait, that's not correct because the H2PO4^- dissociation into PO4^3- would require two steps, each with their own K.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as:

H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+ (Ka2=6.2e-8)

HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+ (Ka3=1.8e-12)

So the overall reaction is H2PO4^- → PO4^3- + 2 H+.

The equilibrium constant K_overall = Ka2 * Ka3 = 6.2e-8 * 1.8e-12 = 1.116e-19.

The expression for [PO4^3-] from H2PO4^- would be:

[PO4^3-] = (K_overall [H2PO4^-}) / [H+]^2.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.116e-19 * 0.036735) / (8.204e-8)^2.

Calculate numerator: 1.116e-19 *0.036735≈4.106e-21.

Denominator: (8.204e-8)^2=6.73e-15.

So,

[PO4^3-] = 4.106e-21 /6.73e-15 ≈6.098e-7 M.

So, that's about 6.1e-7 M.

So, the total [PO4^3-] comes from both HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- dissociation.

Which would be 6.16e-7 (from HPO4^2-) +6.098e-7 (from H2PO4^-) ≈1.226e-6 M.

Wait, but that's much higher than any of the options. So I must have made a mistake in this approach.

Wait, no, because in reality, the HPO4^2- comes from both the Na2HPO4 and the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

But when I calculated [PO4^3-] from HPO4^2-, I considered the HPO4^2- in solution, which includes both the initial amount and the amount from dissociation.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The primary source of PO4^3- is the dissociation of HPO4^2-, which is 6.16e-7 M. The contribution from H2PO4^- is negligible (about 6e-7 M as well, but that can't be right because it's two steps).

Wait, no, the contribution from H2PO4^- is actually negligible because the second dissociation is much larger in K. So perhaps the [PO4^3-] is approximately 6.16e-7 M.

So, the correct answer would be approximately 6.16e-7 M, which is closest to option A (6.24e-7 M).

But looking again, the options don't have this exact value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the exact calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the concentration of orthophosphate is the sum of HPO4^2- and PO4^3-.

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-, but that's way higher than the options.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem in terms of the initial moles and the solution volume, and then account for the dissociations.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- using the buffer equation, and then calculate the concentration of PO4^3- from that.

But I think I've done that already.

In any case, the calculation suggests that the [PO4^3-] is approximately 6.16e-7 M, which is closest to option A (6.24e-7 M).

But looking at the options, option D is 3.97e-7 M, which is exactly half of 7.94e-7. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of [H+] without approximating.

Wait, pH =7.0925 → [H+] = 10^(-7.0925) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0925).

10^(-0.0925) = 0.8208.

So, [H+] = 8.208e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / 8.208e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.028085 = 5.0553e-14.

Divide by denominator:5.0553e-14 /8.208e-8 = (5.0553 /8.208) * 1e-6 ≈0.616e-6 =6.16e-7.

Which is option A: 6.24e-7 is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the initial moles.

Wait, 1.00 g of KH2PO4 is 1/136.09 ≈0.007347 mol.

1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O is 1/177.99 ≈0.005617 mol.

So,

[H2PO4^-] =0.007347 mol /0.2 L =0.036735 M.

[HPO4^2-] =0.005617 /0.2 =0.028085 M.

So, the ratio is 0.028085/0.036735 ≈0.765.

pH = pKa2 + log(0.765) =7.2075 -0.115 =7.0925.

[H+] =8.208e-8 M.

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.028085)/8.208e-8 = (5.0553e-14)/(8.208e-8) =6.16e-7 M.

So, the answer should be approximately 6.16e-7 M, which is closest to option A (6.24e-7 M).

But since it's not exact, perhaps the correct option is D) 3.97e-7 M. How could that be?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in considering the buffer concentrations. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution, which is 0.028 M, but that's not any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is made by mixing the two salts, and the concentrations are adjusted by the pH.

Another approach: The moles of H2PO4^- is 0.007347 mol, and HPO4^2- is 0.005617 mol.

The total volume is 0.2 L.

The pH is 7.09.

The buffer equation is pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

So, [HPO4^2-] = [H2PO4^-] * 10^(pH - pKa2).

= [H2PO4^-] * 10^(7.0925 -7.2075).

= [H2PO4^-] * 10^(-0.115).

= [H2PO4^-] * 0.765.

Let me let [H2PO4^-] = x, [HPO4^2-] =0.765 x.

The total concentration:

x + 0.765 x = (0.007347 +0.005617)/0.2 → 0.012964/0.2=0.06482 M.

So,

1.765 x = 0.06482 → x=0.06482 /1.765 ≈0.03668 M.

So, [HPO4^2-] =0.765 *0.03668 ≈0.02808 M.

So, the [HPO4^2-] is 0.02808 M, which isn't any of the options.

But the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-, then the answer is 0.02808 M, which isn't an option. So perhaps the question refers to PO4^3-.

But earlier calculations show that [PO4^3-] is about 6.16e-7 M, which is closest to option A.

So, I think the correct answer is option A) 6.24e-7 M.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of phosphate species in the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains 1.00 g of each salt, with molecular weights of 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). 

### Step 1: Calculate initial moles and concentrations
- **KH₂PO₄**:  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007347 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Concentration of \( \text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- \):  
  \( [\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-] = \frac{0.007347}{0.2} \approx 0.036735 \, \text{M} \).

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005617 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Concentration of \( \text{HPO}_4^{2-} \):  
  \( [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}] = \frac{0.005617}{0.2} \approx 0.028085 \, \text{M} \).

### Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation
The buffer system involves \( \text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- \) and \( \text{HPO}_4^{2-} \), with \( \text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- \) acting as the acid and \( \text{HPO}_4^{2-} \) as the base. The relevant \( \text{pKa} \) is \( \text{pKa}_2 \) for \( \text{H}_3\text{PO}_4 \), where \( \text{Ka}_2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \), giving \( \text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.2075 \).

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-]}\right)
\]
Substitute the concentrations:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.2075 + \log\left(\frac{0.028085}{0.036735}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.2075 + \log(0.765) \approx 7.2075 - 0.115 = 7.0925
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the concentration of \( \text{PO}_4^{3-} \)
The problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate refers to \( \text{PO}_4^{3-} \), we calculate its concentration using the dissociation of \( \text{HPO}_4^{2-} \):  
\[
\text{HPO}_4^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{PO}_4^{3-} + \text{H}^+
\]
The \( \text{Ka}_3 \) for this reaction is \( 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \). Using the equilibrium expression:  
\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{PO}_4^{3-}][\text{H}^+]}{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}
\]
Rearranging for \( [\text{PO}_4^{3-}] \):  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}^+]}
\]
The \( [\text{H}^+] \) is determined from the pH:  
\[
[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.0925} \approx 8.208 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]
Substitute the values:  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028085)}{8.208 \times 10^{-8}}
\]
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{5.0553 \times 10^{-14}}{8.208 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.16 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated concentration of \( \text{PO}_4^{3-} \) is approximately \( 6.16 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \). Among the given options, the closest value is **\( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**.

ANSWER: A
