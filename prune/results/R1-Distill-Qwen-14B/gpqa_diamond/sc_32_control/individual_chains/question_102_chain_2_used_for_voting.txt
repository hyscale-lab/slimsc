Okay, so I have this science question here about a ligand-receptor pair and some genetic engineering stuff. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to break it down.

The question is about a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. I remember that bicistronic means it has two genes under a single promoter. So, the vector has the ligand ORF at the 5' end fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF at the 3' end with eGFP. Oh wait, but there are these loxP and lox2272 cassettes with stop signals in between.

So the setup is that the ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor, there's an IRES element. IRES allows internal ribosome entry, so it can drive the expression of the downstream gene without requiring a new promoter. But wait, in this case, the receptor might be expressed only if the IRES is functional. But I'm not sure how this affects the situation.

The ligand is at 5', so it's first in the vector. The CBA promoter should drive the transcription of both the ligand and the receptor. The stop signals with loxP and lox2272 cassettes are probably for conditional expression. I think the Cre-lox system is used here to remove the stop signals, allowing the expression of the fluorescent proteins.

The person made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. They tested the expression in primary astrocyte culture using Western blot. The blot shows signals proportional to actin loading, which probably means that the proteins are being expressed, right? Because actin is a loading control, so if the blot shows the same loading each time, the proteins are there.

Then they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest cells. Cre would recombine the lox sites. Wait, but the vector has loxP and lox2272. Oh, right, because the two stops are different lox sites. So, perhaps the idea is that Cre would delete the stop cassettes, allowing the expression of mCherry and eGFP.

But when they look under the confocal, there's no green signal. eGFP is the receptor part. So the question is why the eGFP isn't being expressed or isn't fluorescent.

Looking at the options:

Option A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on neighboring cells. But the construct is in the same cell, so that might not matter. But I'm not sure how that affects the expression in the Western blot. Since Western blot shows the proteins are present, maybe this isn't the issue.

Option B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If it's stuck, it wouldn't get to the cell surface, but the Western blot would still detect the protein because it's present in the cell. Unless the blot isn't detecting it because it's in the wrong place. But the question says the blot gives signals proportional to actin, so perhaps the proteins are being expressed. Unless the eGFP isn't being made. Or maybe the blot uses anti-receptor or anti-eGFP antibodies, but if they're present, the Western would show. Hmm, not sure.

Option C) the enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. The vector uses the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter. Unless the enhancer is missing, the expression may not happen. Wait, but the Western blot showed the proteins are present when transfected into astrocytes. So the promoter must be working. Unless in the mouse model, the enhancer isn't present, but I'm not certain about this.

Option D) the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Oh, wait, the vector has the receptor ORF fused to eGFP. If it's a stop cassette between them, but perhaps in the mouse model, the lox sites were recombined correctly. Wait, but the vector has a stop in a loxP cassette between ligand and mCherry. That would mean that without Cre, the ligand is expressed with mCherry. Similarly, the receptor would have a stop in lox2272, which Cre can't cut (since lox2272 is a variant that Cre can't recognize unless it's a loxP/lox2272 pair). Wait, wait, no, lox2272 is a mutant lox site that only FLP recombinase can cut. Oh, right, because the original loxP is recognized by Cre, but lox2272 is a variant that Cre can't cut. So the vector design is such that the ligand and mCherry are separated by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. The receptor and eGFP are separated by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

So when Cre is introduced, like in the mouse crossed with SOX10-Cre, what happens?

The Cre should recognize the loxP sites. So, in the ligand region, the loxP-stop-loxP is flanked by loxP sites. Cre would delete the stop, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed together. For the receptor, the stop is flanked by lox2272 and another site, perhaps? Wait, the question says between the receptor and eGFP is a stop in the lox2272 cassette. So, the receptor is followed by lox2272, stop, lox2272. Since Cre can't cut lox2272, the stop remains, so the receptor and eGFP are not co-expressed unless the FLP recombinase is present, which isn't the case here.

Wait, wait. So the vector is set up so that the ligand is 5' with stop under loxP, and receptor 3' with stop under lox2272. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand would be expressed as ligand-mCherry, and the receptor would be under the IRES, but since the stop is in the lox2272 cassette, which Cre can't cut, the receptor cannot be expressed unless FLP is present. So when the Cre is introduced (from SOX10-Cre), the Cre would cut the loxP sites around the ligand's stop cassette, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop is under lox2272, which Cre can't cut, so the receptor can't be expressed.

Wait, but the mouse is homozygous for the construct, and crossed with SOX10-Cre. So the Cre would be active in neural crest cells, where SOX10 is expressed. So in those cells, Cre would delete the loxP sites, which are around the ligand's stop. So ligand and mCherry would be expressed. But the receptor's stop is in a lox2272 cassette, which Cre can't cut. So the receptor is under the IRES, but the stop can't be removed because Cre doesn't affect lox2272. So the receptor would not be expressed. Therefore, the eGFP (fused to the receptor) wouldn't be made, hence no green signal.

But wait, the western blot detected the proteins. So perhaps when the vector was transfected into astrocytes, without Cre, the ligand and mCherry are expressed because the loxP stop is there, but the receptor is not. But in the mouse, if the Cre is introduced, then in neural crest cells, the ligand would be expressed, but the receptor wouldn't because the stop in the lox2272 isn't removed. So in the mouse model, the receptor-eGFP wouldn't be expressed, so no green signal.

Wait, but the problem says that they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in the wt background. So the construct is present in the mouse's genome. When they cross the mouse with SOX10-Cre, the Cre is introduced. SOX10-Cre is probably active in neural crest cells, so in those cells, Cre would excise the loxP sites. So the ligand would be expressed (because the stop is removed), but the receptor wouldn't be, because the stop is under a different lox site that Cre can't cut.

So the eGFP (which is part of the receptor construct) isn't expressed, so no green signal in the confocal. But the Western blot would pick up the receptor if it's expressed. Wait, but in the Western blot, they saw expression, perhaps indicating that the construct is working. But in the mouse, the Cre is only active in certain cells. So in cells where Cre isn't active, the receptor remains under the stop. But in cells where Cre is active (like neural crest), the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't, because the stop isn't excised.

Wait, but the mouse is homozygous for the construct, meaning both alleles are modified. When they crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre would cause the loxP sites to be cut in the construct, but not the lox2272. So the ligand would be expressed, but the receptor wouldn't. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, so no green signal in the confocal.

Wait, but the question says that in the Western blot, the proteins are expressed. So maybe in the mouse, the Cre isn't active, or the construct isn't correctly recombined. Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is still present.

Wait, the other option is that the eGFP is not in frame. If the stop is present in the vector between receptor and eGFP, then the receptor would be expressed without eGFP. But with the IRES, perhaps the eGFP is in frame. Wait, the vector has the receptor ORF at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. Wait, the way the vector is set up, the receptor is at 3', and the eGFP is at the C-terminus. So the construct is ligand (with stop) followed by mCherry, then IRES, receptor, eGFP, with a stop in another cassette.

But without the Cre, the ligand is expressed with mCherry. The receptor is under IRES but has a stop in lox2272 cassette. IRES allows for expression of the second gene. But the stop in lox2272 would prevent eGFP expression unless FLP is present. So in the absence of Cre, the receptor would not be expressed. But in the mouse, the Cre is present, but it only affects the loxP sites. So the lox2272 sites are unchanged, so the receptor can't be expressed.

So the problem is that the eGFP (receptor) isn't being expressed because the stop is still present. So the reason no green signal is observed is because the stop remains between receptor and eGFP. Which option matches this?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Wait, if the stop is present, the receptor would be expressed as a truncated protein without eGFP. But if the stop is in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. Alternatively, if the stop is out of frame, it might cause a frame shift, but the question says the stop is in the lox2272 cassette, which is flanked by lox sites. Without the stop being cut, the receptor's ORF is interrupted.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the stop is still present. So when the Cre is introduced, the ligand's stop is cut, but the receptor's stop is not. So the receptor's ORF includes the stop before eGFP. So the receptor is not expressed, and the eGFP is not either. So the Western blot would show the ligand and mCherry, but not the receptor and eGFP? But the question says that the blot showed signals proportional to actin loading. So perhaps the proteins are expressed, but in the mouse, the eGFP is not expressed because the stop isn't cut.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The vector is bicistronic. Ligand is 5', under CBA promoter. Receptor is 3', under IRES. Between ligand and mCherry is a stop in loxP cassette. Between receptor and eGFP is a stop in lox2272 cassette.

In the mouse, when Cre is introduced, it would recombine the loxP sites around the ligand's stop, deleting it. So ligand and mCherry are co-expressed. But the receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So the receiver's ORF is still interrupted by a stop, meaning the receptor and eGFP are not expressed. So in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed, so no green signal.

But the question says that after plasmid transfection to primary astrocytes, the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin. So the proteins are expressed. That suggests that in the transient transfection, perhaps the stop between the receptor and eGFP is not present. Or maybe the vector, when transfected without Cre, doesn't have the stops, but that's not the case here. Wait, the vector has the stops as part of the cassettes.

Wait, no, in the vector, the ligand is in frame with mCherry, but the stop is in the loxP cassette. So without Cre, the ligand and mCherry would be separated by a stop, so they are not co-expressed. But upon Cre introduction, the stop is deleted, so ligand and mCherry are co-expressed.

For the receptor, the stop is in lox2272 cassette. Cre can't cut that, so the stop remains. So the receptor is expressed as a non-functional protein, because the stop is before eGFP. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

But why is the Western blot showing the proteins? Oh, perhaps in the transient transfection, the plasmid is present without Cre, so the ligand is under stop, and the receptor is under IRES but with a stop. Hmm, I'm getting myself more confused. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed. So without the stop, the receptor is expressed. Wait, no, the stop is in the lox2272 cassette. So the receptor's stop is present unless FLP recombinase is there. Since FLP isn't present, the stop remains, so the receptor can't be expressed. So the eGFP isn't expressed. But the Western blot shows the proteins? So maybe the antibodies against the overexpressed proteins are detecting other parts.

Wait, maybe the Western blot is showing that the proteins are expressed because the stop is not in the way when transfected without Cre. But in the mouse, after Cre is introduced, the stop is cut for the ligand, but not for the receptor. So in the mouse, the receptor isn't expressed, so no eGFP.

So the possible reason for no green signal is that the receptor and eGFP are not being expressed because the stop is still present. Looking at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Oh, wait, if the stop is present, the receptor isn't in frame with eGFP. So the eGFP isn't expressed. So the Western blot would detect the receptor if it's expressed, but maybe it's not. But the question states that the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin, which probably indicates the proteins are expressed. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the IRES isn't working correctly. IRES allows the expression of the receptor and eGFP as a single ORF? Or perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the issue is that the eGFP is not in frame. If the stop isn't cut, the eGFP isn't expressed. So in the mouse model, the eGFP isn't expressed, hence no green signal. So why? Because the stop is still present. But which option corresponds to this?

Option C says the enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. I don't think this is the case because the CBA promoter is strong.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would mean that the eGFP isn't expressed because the reading frame is disrupted. But the stop is present, so the receptor isn't expressed. So maybe D isn't the right answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct in the mouse isn't correctly recombined, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But the options don't directly reflect that.

Wait, another angle: the vector is designed such that the receptor is at the 3' with eGFP. The stop is between them. So when Cre is introduced, it cuts loxP sites, but not lox2272. So the stop in the receptor-eGFP segment remains, so the receptor can't be expressed. Therefore, the eGFP isn't made. So in the mouse, the receptor isn't expressed, so no eGFP. But in the Western blot, the proteins are expressed. So perhaps the Western blot is testing the cells before Cre is introduced, so the ligand and receptor are both expressed in the transient transfection. But in the mouse, Cre is introduced, so only the ligand is expressed, and the receptor isn't.

Wait, the Western blot is after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture. So the cells are transfected, and the proteins are expressed. So the stop hasn't been cut because Cre isn't present yet. So in the vector, the ligand and mCherry are under a stop, so they are not co-expressed. The receptor and eGFP are under a stop as well, so they're not expressed either. But I'm not sure. The blot shows the proteins are expressed, but perhaps the antibodies are against the ligand and receptor, not the fluorescent proteins. So the ligand and receptor are expressed, but not the fluorescent proteins. That would mean that the eGFP isn't expressed in the mouse because the stop remains, so no green.

So, the reason there's no green signal is because the eGFP isn't being expressed, and the option that explains this is probably D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Wait, no. The stop is present, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is that the stop is present, so the eGFP isn't made. But none of the options directly state that. The options are about the expression setup.

Another thought: the receptor is under IRES, which is after the ligand. So IRES can drive the expression of the receptor and eGFP. But if the stop is present, the IRES can't function. Or perhaps the IRES is after the stop, so the receptor isn't expressed.

Wait, the vector design: ligand ORF is 5' with stop, then mCherry. Then IRES, then receptor ORF, then stop in lox2272, then eGFP.

So the IRES is after the stop for mCherry. So the IRES would allow the receptor and eGFP to be expressed as a single mRNA. Without the stop, the receptor and eGFP would be expressed. But with the stop in the lox2272 cassette, the stop remains, so the IRES is followed by a stop. So the IRES can't drive the expression of the receptor and eGFP.

Thus, in the mouse, the IRES is followed by a stop, so the receptor isn't expressed. So eGFP isn't expressed.

So why is the Western blot showing the proteins are expressed? Because in the transfection, without Cre, the ligand is under a stop, so not expressed. But the receptor is under the IRES, but the stop is present, so not expressed. Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should look at the options again.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP is stuck in Golgi. That would prevent it from fluorescing but the Western blot would still show it. The question says the blot shows signal proportional to actin, so the proteins are expressed.

Option C: enhancer missing. But the promoter is CBA, which is a strong promoter.

Option D: not in frame. If the stop is present, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the construct is out of frame, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another point. The vector has the ligand at 5' and the receptor at 3', with stops between. When Cre is used, it deletes the 5' stop, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed. The 3' stop is under lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So the receptor and eGFP remain under a stop. So the IRES can't help because the stop is in the way. So the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed.

In the mouse, the Cre is present, so the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't. Hence, the eGFP isn't expressed, so no green in the confocal.

So the reason is that the stop remains between the receptor and eGFP, so the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed. But looking at the options, which one matches this.

Option C says the enhancer is missing. Unlikely, as the promoter is strong.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP isn't expressed. But if it's in frame, but a stop is present, then the stop would cause a premature termination. So, the presence of the stop would mean the eGFP isn't expressed, regardless of the frame.

So the problem is that the stop is present, so the eGFP isn't expressed. Which of the options points to this?

Alternatively, perhaps the stop is in the way, making the eGFP not expressed. So the issue is that the stop remains, which is option C? No. Because option C is about the enhancer, which is not the case here.

Wait, another angle: the IRES element might not be functional if the stop is present. Because after the IRES, the stop would prevent the expression of the receptor and eGFP.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct is designed such that the IRES is between the ligand and receptor, but with the stops in the way. But I'm not quite getting it.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is option C: the enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the CBA promoter is a strong enhancer/promoter. So that's not likely.

Another possibility: the IRES is only functional in the presence of a specific enhancer, which isn't present. But the question doesn't mention that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the Cre didn't recombine the lox sites correctly. So the stop remains, and the eGFP isn't expressed. But the question says that the mouse is homozygous for the construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre. So the Cre should have been active in the neural crest cells, where the ligand and receptor are expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the SOX10-Cre isn't active, but that's unlikely.

Hmm. Another approach: the Western blot shows the proteins are expressed when transfected. So the construct works when transiently transfected. But in the mouse, after Cre is introduced, the eGFP isn't expressed. So perhaps the issue is that in the mouse, the eGFP is not correctly expressed because the stop remains.

Looking back at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would mean that when the stop is cut, the reading frame is altered, so eGFP isn't expressed. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the vector has the ligand and mCherry in one cassette and the receptor and eGFP in another. When Cre is introduced, only the ligand's stop is cut, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop remains, so the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed. So the eGFP isn't present.

So the reason for no green signal is that the receptor and eGFP are not expressed because their stop isn't cut. But the options don't directly state that.

Wait, looking at option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the problem is that the CBA promoter is present, so the enhancer should be there.

Alternatively, perhaps the enhancer is required for the IRES to function. For example, if the IRES requires an enhancer that's missing, then the receptor isn't expressed. But the question doesn't mention any enhancer issues.

Hmm, this is tricky. I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to pick the most plausible option.

The fact that the stop is present between receptor and eGFP means the eGFP isn't expressed. So the reason is that the eGFP isn't co-expressed with the receptor because the stop isn't cut. Looking at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. If they're not in frame, the eGFP isn't expressed. But the presence of the stop would also prevent that.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop is present, leading to no expression. But none of the options directly address the presence of the stop. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the vector is bicistronic, so the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP are two separate cassettes. The loxP-stop is for the ligand-mCherry. The lox2272-stop is for the receptor-eGFP.

In the mouse, when Cre is introduced, it deletes the loxP stop, allowing ligand-mCherry to be expressed. The lox2272 stop isn't cut by Cre, so the receptor-eGFP remains under stop. So the IRES isn't effective because the stop is in the way. So the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed. Therefore, in the confocal, only the ligand and mCherry would be present, but not eGFP.

So the reason is that the stop remains between the receptor and eGFP, preventing their expression. So the correct option would be that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't cut. The options don't directly say that, but option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, which would prevent their expression.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is the reason. If the enhancer is missing, neither the ligand nor the receptor would be expressed. But the Western blot shows the proteins are expressed, so that can't be.

Wait, another approach: the lox2272 is a variant that Cre can't cut. So the stop between the receptor and eGFP isn't removed. Hence, the eGFP isn't expressed. Therefore, no green signal. So the reason is that the stop is present.

But none of the options directly state this. So I need to see which option corresponds to this.

Looking again, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. So, if the stop is present, the ORF is interrupted, which would mean they're not in frame. So perhaps option D is the answer.

Alternatively, the eGFP is not expressed because the stop is present, so the receptor isn't expressed, making option D incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the question is indicating that the stop is present, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of the possible answer as the fact that the stop remains, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But looking at the options, the best fit is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. So, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is present, leading to a frame shift.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand and receptor pair. The ligand is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' position, fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is regulated by an IRES element. Between the ligand and mCherry, there is a stop cassette flanked by loxP sites, while between the receptor and eGFP, there is a stop cassette flanked by lox2272 sites. The mouse model is homozygous for this construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre mice to activate Cre recombinase, which should delete the loxP stop cassette, allowing ligand and mCherry expression. However, the lox2272 stop cassette cannot be cut by Cre, so the receptor and eGFP remain under a stop.

The confocal microscopy reveals no green signal, indicating that the receptor-eGFP construct is not expressed. The Western blot shows protein expression proportional to actin loading, suggesting that the proteins are being expressed in the transient transfection but not in the mouse model after Cre activation. The absence of the green signal is due to the stop cassette flanking the receptor and eGFP, which prevents their expression. This issue arises because the lox2272 stop cassette cannot be removed by Cre, leaving the stop in place and disrupting the expression of the receptor and eGFP.

Among the options provided, the most plausible explanation is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame, preventing their expression. This aligns with the observation that the stop cassette remains intact, disrupting the expression of the receptor and eGFP.

Answer: D
