Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data and then determining the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out what Compound X is. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR. Then, based on that, I have to see what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Oh, wait, red phosphorus and HI usually lead to some kind of substitution or elimination reaction, maybe a dehydrohalogenation or something else? Or wait, no, wait—wait, red phosphorus is often used in the formation of the ylide in the Wittig reaction. Oh right! The Wittig reaction uses triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide to form a ylide, which then reacts with aldehydes or ketones to form alkenes. But wait, the question says red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up reagents here. Alternatively, red phosphorus is used in the dehydrohalogenation with HI to form alkenes. Oh wait, no, wait. When an alkyl halide is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it can lead to the formation of alkenes via the Hoffman elimination. Or is that another reaction?

Wait, Hoffman elimination is when you have a treatment with a strong base, like in the case of amides, leading to elimination. Alternatively, when you have a tertiary alkyl halide reacting with a strong base like HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it leads to a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. Or wait, another possibility: red phosphorus is used in the formation of the ylide for the Wittig, but the presence of HI suggests maybe a different reaction. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene.

But let's first focus on figuring out what Compound X is. Let's look at the IR data first.

IR peaks: 3400–2500 cm-1 suggests there's an O-H stretch, maybe a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches around 2500-3300 cm-1. The other peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that could be a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. Then, 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So that suggests an aromatic ring with substituents.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows peaks at:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, but wait, the integration is 1H. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid proton? Wait, carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm, but they are usually broad. Wait, but the IR at 1720 cm-1 could be a ketone, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm-1, maybe a bit higher. Hmm, wait, maybe 1720 is a bit high for a carboxylic acid. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Typically, aldehydes have C=O around 1720 cm-1, and carboxylic acids around 1700 cm-1. Or wait, no, wait: Carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch, and their C=O is usually around 1700 cm-1, but sometimes a bit higher. Aldehydes have C=O around 2820 (stretch for the -CH) and 1720. Wait, no, wait—the carbonyl for an aldehyde is about 1720 cm-1. So the IR has a strong peak at 1720. So maybe the compound has an aldehyde group.

But looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But 10.5 is a bit high. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the proton would be around 10-12, but also with a broad peak. But the IR for a carboxylic acid would have the O-H stretch around 2500-3300, which the IR data shows. Wait, but the IR shows 3400-2500, which is a broad region, possibly an O-H stretch. If the peak is 1720, which is a strong C=O, that could be either an aldehyde or a ketone or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if the compound has a carboxylic acid group, the NMR should have a broad singlet around 12 ppm for the O-H, but here it's 10.5. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aldehyde. Let's tentatively think it's an aldehyde.

Wait, but let's look at the other NMR peaks. At 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests para-substituted aromatic protons. For instance, if we have a para-disubstituted benzene ring, the two protons would be as doublets. The 8.0 ppm is more deshielded, perhaps closer to an electron-withdrawing group, and 7.2 is more shielded, maybe adjacent to an electron-donating group. Wait, but the exact substituents would influence the chemical shifts.

Looking at the other peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Hmm, the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to something that's perhaps next to a CH2 group. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) could be a methyl group attached to a CH, like in an isopropyl group. Wait, but it's a doublet, which would suggest coupling with one neighboring proton. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) might be a CH2 next to another group, perhaps a CH or a carbonyl.

Putting this together: Perhaps there's an aromatic ring with substituents. Looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons are a doublet each, which suggests a para-substituted benzene. So like a para-substituted benzoic acid or benzaldehyde.

Wait, but let's think about the substituents. If the IR has a carbonyl, then the substituent on the benzene ring is likely a carbonyl group, such as a ketone, aldehyde, or acid.

Wait, another thought: The 10.5 ppm peak could be a carbonyl group. But wait, in an aromatic aldehyde (like benzaldehyde), the aldehyde proton is around 9.8-10 ppm, which matches 10.5 ppm. So perhaps it's a substituted benzaldehyde.

So, the structure could be something like p-alkylbenzaldehyde. But let's look at the other peaks.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) suggests a CH group and two CH2 groups, perhaps in a chain. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, like in an isopropyl group. Wait, but the 0.9 ppm t (3H) is a terminal methyl group, perhaps part of an ethyl chain.

Let me try to sketch this out. Suppose the benzene ring is para-substituted. One substituent is the aldehyde group (-CHO), and the other substituent is a chain that leads to a methyl group.

Looking at the NMR:

- The 8.0 ppm d (2H) and 7.2 ppm d (2H) are the aromatic protons. Since they are doublets, each proton is coupled to one adjacent proton, which is typical for a para-substituted ring.

So the substituents are on the para positions. Let's say one substituent is the aldehyde group (-CHO), and the other is a branched alkyl chain.

The other peaks:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Maybe a methylene or a methine group next to branching.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 or CH.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A methyl group attached to a CH, like in an isopropyl group. So, if it's a CH(CH2CH3) group or something similar.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a group like CH2CH(CH2CH3)2? Wait, no. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a branched chain.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the structure. The substituent is an aliphatic chain attached to the benzene ring. The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which suggests a methyl group adjacent to a CH2. So maybe a CH2CH2CH3 group, but also, the 1.7 ppm and 2.9 ppm are part of a chain. Let's think about a butyl group.

But the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which is a methyl group attached to a CH. So, perhaps (CH2)2CHCH(CH3)2? Hmm, not quite sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let me think: A sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait. Sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. Wait, perhaps it's -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)2? Or maybe it's a tert-butyl group, but that would have a singlet for the methyl groups.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with branching. Let me try to imagine:

The substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)2 group? Wait, that might not be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. That suggests that this proton is adjacent to two different types of neighboring protons. So, perhaps a -CH- group connected to a CH2 and another CH group.

Wait, another angle: Let's consider that the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the CH2 next to the CH group. The 2.9 ppm is the CH group, and the 1.4 ppm is the methyl group attached to the CH. The 0.9 ppm is the terminal methyl.

Wait, that would make a structure like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-... Hmm, no, wait. Let's think: The CH group is connected to a CH2 and a CH3. So the structure around that would be like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-something. Wait, perhaps it's a propyl chain but with a branch.

Wait, let's take the substituent as -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. No, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 3-methylbutyl group or something similar.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should think about the integration and splitting.

The 1H NMR has:

- 10.5 ppm (1H, broad): likely the aldehyde proton.
- 8.0 ppm (2H, d): aromatic protons ortho to substituents.
- 7.2 ppm (2H, d): para positions.
- 2.9 ppm (1H, m): maybe a CH in the substituent.
- 1.7 ppm (2H, m): two CH2 groups.
- 1.4 ppm (3H, d): a CH3 attached to a CH.
- 0.9 ppm (3H, t): a CH3 at the end of a chain.

So, the substituent on the benzene is an aldehyde group, and another substituent which is an aliphatic chain. So, the structure would be p-substituted benzaldehyde with another substituent.

Wait, but the IR also shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. If the substituent is a benzaldehyde, then that carbonyl would be the aldehyde group. So perhaps the molecule is something like 4-(some alkyl group)benzaldehyde.

Now, the substituent's structure. Let's look at the NMR again. The 2.9 ppm (1H, m): perhaps a CH group connected to two CH2 groups and a methyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with branching. For example, it could be a (CH2)2CH- group, but that would have a triplet for the CH2. Alternatively, perhaps it's an isopropyl group attached to another CH2.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. So, if that's CH(CH3), then the adjacent group would be a CH2. For example, a structure like -CH2-CH(CH3)-something.

Wait, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): perhaps this is the CH2 group next to the CH. So, if the substituent is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-... Hmm, but that doesn't quite add up.

Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH2-CH(CH(CH3))2 group? But that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps it's a pentyl group with a branch. Wait, maybe the substituent is a pentyl group but with a branch, making it a secondary carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let me think: A sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, wait. The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, no, actually, the structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, that's a neopentyl group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, let's think about the substituent as being a (CH2)2CHCH3 group, but that would be a pentyl group, but the NMR doesn't show enough peaks for that.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a isopropyl group attached to a CH2. So, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)2. But then, the NMR would show a singlet for the methyl groups, but in our data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet, not a singlet, so that can't be.

Wait, another angle: the 1H NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H). That suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group. So, the chain ends with a CH2CH2CH3. So, the substituent on the benzene is something like -CH2CH2CH(CH3)-... Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group. But then the NMR would have a triplet at 0.9, which it does. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the CH2 groups adjacent to the CH and the CH(CH2CH3). The 2.9 ppm (1H, m) would be the CH group connected to both CH2 groups and the methyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- group? No, that would require more protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, but that seems complicated.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But then, the NMR would have a triplet at 0.9 (from the CH2CH2CH3) and a doublet for the adjacent CH2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the integration and the splitting. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to a CH (the 2.9 ppm proton). The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl attached to a CH (the same as the 2.9 ppm proton). Then, the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, which would be at the end of a CH2CH2CH3 chain. So putting that together, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group where the middle CH is attached to a methyl group.

Wait, another approach: Let's imagine the substituent is a butyl group. A butyl group could be straight-chain or branched.

If it's a straight butyl group (-CH2CH2CH2CH3), then the NMR would show a triplet for the CH3 (0.9 ppm, t), a quartet for the adjacent CH2 (around 1.2-1.5 ppm), and a triplet for the next CH2 (around 1.6 ppm), and a quartet around 2.5 ppm for the CH2 next to the benzene. But in our data, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet, and the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet, so perhaps the substituent is branched.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Let's see: the substituent on the benzene would be a CH2 connected to a CH(CH2CH3), and that CH has a CH3 attached.

Wait, no, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me think: The substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but that would make the substituent longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Hmm, but that would have a branching point.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So the structure would be benzene with a CHO group in one position and a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group in the para position.

But wait, then the NMR would have:

- The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) for the CH in CH2CH(CH2CH3).
- The CH would be connected to a CH2 (1.7 ppm, m, 2H) and a CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm, t, 3H).
- The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be a methyl group attached to the CH. Wait, but that doesn't fit because the substituent is CH2CH(CH2CH3), which doesn't have a methyl attached to the CH.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about the possible structures given the NMR and IR data and then see what the reaction would yield.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Wait, no, that's not right. Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, looking at options, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde derivative, and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would form an alkene.

Wait, but the reaction conditions are red phosphorus and HI. Oh! That's the reaction to form a ylide for the Wittig reaction. Wait, no, wait. Red phosphorus and HI are usually used in the dehydrohalogenation of a vicinal dihalide to form an alkene. Alternatively, in the presence of an alkyl halide, red phosphorus and HI can lead to elimination to form alkenes.

Wait, but the question says Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. So, perhaps Compound X is an alkyl halide, and the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene.

Wait, but the IR and NMR data don't indicate an alkyl halide. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Wittig reaction, where the ylide is formed from an alkyl halide and then reacts with a carbonyl group in Compound X.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let's think again.

Wait, the IR of Compound X has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. So, if Compound X has a carbonyl group, perhaps after reacting with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes some kind of elimination or addition.

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI are usually for forming the ylide from an alkyl halide. So if Compound X has an alkyl halide group, then the reaction would form an ylide.

Wait, but in the NMR, I don't see any peaks that suggest an alkyl halide, like a triplet from a CH2 next to a Br or something. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps Compound X is a benzaldehyde derivative, and the reaction is the Wittig reaction. Wait, but the Wittig reaction requires an alkyl halide and a carbonyl. Oh wait, no, the Wittig reagent (ylide) reacts with a carbonyl (like an aldehyde or ketone) to form an alkene.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Wittig reaction where the ylide is generated from an alkyl halide, and then adds to the aldehyde group in Compound X to form an alkene.

But in that case, the product would be an alkene. Looking at the options, options B and D are alkanes (benzene derivatives without carbonyl groups), while options A and C are acids or have carbonyl groups. So if the reaction forms an alkene, the product would be an alkylbenzene with a double bond.

Hmm. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a Hoffman elimination, but that typically involves amides, so maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, eliminating an alkyl halide to form an alkene. But for that, Compound X would be an alkyl halide. But the IR and NMR don't show any peaks that suggest an alkyl halide. The IR doesn't show a peak for C-Cl (around 550-850 cm-1) or C-Br (which is a bit lower, maybe 600-700 cm-1), but there's no such peak here. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of an ester, but the IR doesn't show an ester peak (around 1740 cm-1 and a peak around 1250 cm-1 for the ester C-O). But the IR here shows 1720, which is more like a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, but in the NMR, 10.5 ppm is a bit on the higher side for an aldehyde. Another thought: perhaps the 10.5 ppm is a carboxylic acid proton, but then the IR would have a broad O-H around 3000 cm-1, which it does (3400–2500 cm-1). Wait, the O-H stretch for a carboxylic acid is usually a broad peak around 2500–3300 cm-1. So the IR shows 3400–2500, which could be O-H. Then, the 1720 cm-1 would be the carbonyl. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

But the NMR would then have a broad peak for the carboxylic acid proton, which is around 10-12 ppm, which matches 10.5 ppm.

So, if Compound X is a carboxylic acid, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might be something else. Wait, but I'm not sure how a carboxylic acid would react with red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes using Zn(Hg)/HCl, but that's not the same reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the Birch reduction, which uses NH3 and HCl, but again, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride from a carboxylic acid, but that would require something like SOCl2, not red phosphorus and HI.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the options again. The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So, options B and D are substituted toluenes (alkylbenzenes), while A and C are substituted benzoic acids.

If the reaction produces one of these, perhaps the reaction isn't a Wittig but something else.

Wait, another thought: if Compound X is a benzaldehyde derivative, and it undergoes a reaction that replaces the aldehyde group with something else.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI might be used in the formation of a ylide, but that's when you have an alkyl halide. Since I'm not sure about the structure of Compound X, perhaps I should try to figure it out again.

Alternative approach: Let's look at the NMR data and match it to the options.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Structure: Benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position.

Benzoic acid would have a COOH group. The IR would show O-H (broad) around 3000 cm-1 and a strong C=O around 1700. Wait, but in this case, the IR is 1720 cm-1, which is a bit higher than typical for a carboxylic acid. So perhaps that's a problem.

But let's see the NMR of option C.

The benzoic acid would have:

- A COOH proton around 12 ppm, but in the given data, it's at 10.5. Hmm, that's a bit low.

The aromatic protons would be two doublets, which matches the given data. The substituent is a sec-butyl group.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2.

Wait, no, the structure of sec-butyl is -CH(CH2CH3)CH2-? No, wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)-.

Wait, maybe not. Let me clarify. The sec-butyl group is a four-carbon group where the substitution is on the second carbon. So, the structure is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, no, but that can't be right. Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Actually, the structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, but that's a pentyl group. Hmm.

Wait, no, the correct structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that would have five carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Wait, but a four-carbon group. The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that would be longer than butyl.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group on the benzene ring, and it's a benzoic acid. So, the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, that would be a tertiary substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group which is -CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that would have a longer chain.

In any case, the benzoic acid would have a COOH group, which would show a broad peak in the NMR around 12 ppm. But in the given data, the peak is at 10.5 ppm. So that might not match.

Alternatively, if the reaction forms benzoic acid, then perhaps the product is option C.

But given that the IR and NMR data of Compound X are not matching a benzoic acid, perhaps the starting material is not a benzoic acid.

Wait, let's think about option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene.

Structure: para-substituted benzene with isobutyl and methyl groups.

Wait, no, 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene would be a benzene with isobutyl at position 1 and methyl at position 4, but that's the same as para-substituted.

Wait, but the substituents would be isobutyl and methyl in para positions.

But the NMR of the starting material (Compound X) has an aldehyde proton. If the product doesn't have an aldehyde, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the aldehyde to a CH2 group.

Wait, but the reagents are red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are often used to form the ylide for the Wittig reaction, which would convert an aldehyde into an alkene. So, if Compound X is an aldehyde, say, benzaldehyde derivative, then the Wittig reaction would convert the aldehyde into an alkene.

But looking at the options, options B and D are alkanes, not alkenes.

Wait, but the Wittig reaction forms alkenes. So if the product is an alkene, but the options don't have any alkenes, so perhaps that's not the case.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Another possibility: The reaction between an aldehyde and HI in presence of red phosphorus could be a substitution reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: Maybe Compound X is an aldehyde with a substituent that, after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, undergoes elimination to form a double bond. For example, if the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH2Cl, then with red phosphorus and HI, it could eliminate Cl and form a double bond.

But earlier analysis of the NMR didn't suggest a chlorinated compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH2Br group, but again, the NMR doesn't show any peaks that suggest a Br.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis. If Compound X is a nitrile, then HI and red phosphorus could hydrolyze it, but that doesn't fit the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an organophosphorus ylide, which then reacts with an aldehyde. But in this case, Compound X is the aldehyde, so the Wittig would form an alkene.

Let me think: If Compound X is an aldehyde, then when treated with a Wittig reagent (ylide), it would form an alkene.

But the question states that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. So perhaps Compound X is the ylide precursor, like an alkyl halide, and the aldehyde is another compound.

Wait, but the question's setup is that Compound X is the starting material. So if X is an alkyl halide, then with red phosphorus and HI, it would form the ylide. Then, the ylide would react with an aldehyde (but in this case, X is the alkyl halide), but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of HX from an alkyl halide to form a double bond. For example, if X is CH2CH2CH2CH2Br, then elimination would give CH2=CHCH2CH3.

But how does that fit with the NMR?

Wait, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a CH2CH2CH2Br group. Then, treatment with red phosphorus and HI would eliminate HBr, forming a double bond.

But the NMR data doesn't show any peaks indicative of Br, so that's unlikely.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the possible structures again.

Another approach: Let's imagine that the substituent on the benzene ring is a butyl group, perhaps a sec-butyl group.

The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) which is a methyl group attached to a CH2. The 1.4 ppm (3H, d) is a methyl attached to a CH. The 1.7 ppm (2H, m) could be a CH2 next to a CH. And the 2.9 ppm (1H, m) would be the CH connected to both CH2 groups and the methyl.

So, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2CH(CH3)2, but in that case, the CH would have two methyl groups, so the 1.4 ppm would be a singlet, but it's a doublet, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a isobutyl group. The structure of isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, that's a neopentyl group. Wait, no, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait. Correct structure of isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. No, wait, that's a pentyl group. Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group, but that would be a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let's say it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Then, the NMR would show a triplet for the terminal methyl (0.9 ppm), a quartet for the adjacent CH2 (around 1.5 ppm), a triplet for the next CH2 (around 2.0 ppm), and a CH group at 2.9 ppm.

But this doesn't exactly match the given data either, as the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which would only make sense if there's a methyl attached to a CH.

Wait, another thought: The substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group. So the structure would be benzene-CHO and -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- in para positions. Then, the NMR would have:

- 2.9 ppm (1H, m): the CH group.
- 1.7 ppm (2H, m): the CH2 adjacent.
- 1.4 ppm (3H, d): the methyl group on the CH2CH3.
- 0.9 ppm (3H, t): the terminal methyl of the CH2CH3.

But in this case, the substituent would be a pentyl group with a branch, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, the substituents are a sec-butyl group and a methyl on the benzene ring. So, perhaps Compound X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that after reaction becomes this.

Wait, but how would the reaction produce that?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the aldehyde to a CH2 group. But then the product would have a CH2 group instead of CHO. But the options don't show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard addition followed by protonation. But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the aldehyde oxygen is replaced. But that's not common with red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, another thought: The IR and NMR of Compound X could indicate that it's a benzaldehyde with a substituent. Then, when treated with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the aldehyde is converted into an acid. But why would that happen?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI could act as a reducing agent. Wait, the Clemmensen reduction uses Zn(Hg)/HCl to reduce ketones to alkanes, but HI and red phosphorus might be a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an aldehyde to a carboxylic acid. But that usually requires strong oxidizing conditions, like KMnO4 or CrO3 under acidic conditions.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the oxidation of benzaldehyde to benzoic acid. So, Compound X is benzaldehyde with a substituent, and after reaction, it becomes benzoic acid with the same substituent.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, if Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde, then upon oxidation, it would become 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

But then, why would red phosphorus and HI cause oxidation? They don't typically act as oxidizing agents. Unless it's a different reaction mechanism.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of the IR and NMR data again.

Compound X IR: 3400–2500 (O-H?), 1720 (C=O), 1610, 1450 (aromatic C=C).

NMR: 10.5 (1H, broad, maybe aldehyde), aromatic protons (8.0 and 7.2, doublets), and an aliphatic chain with a triplet at 0.9, CH2 at 1.7, a CH at 2.9, and a CH3 at 1.4.

So, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. Let's say it's a (CH2)2CHCH3 group. Then, the NMR would have:

- The triplet at 0.9 (3H) from the terminal CH3.
- The adjacent CH2 would show up around 1.4-1.6 as a quartet.
- The next CH2 would be around 1.7 as a triplet or quartet.
- The CH would be around 2.5-2.9 as a multiplet.

But the given data has 1.4 (d, 3H) which is a methyl attached to a CH.

So, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2, but that would require a tert-butyl group.

Wait, but the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl attached to a CH, which is then attached to another group.

Putting it all together, the substituent is likely a secondary butyl group, i.e., a sec-butyl group.

So, the structure of Compound X is para-substituted benzaldehyde with a sec-butyl group.

So, the structure would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde.

Then, when this compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it undergoes a Wittig reaction. Wait, but the Wittig requires an alkyl halide and the aldehyde. Oh, wait, no, the ylide is formed from the alkyl halide, which then reacts with the aldehyde.

But in this case, the starting material is the aldehyde, not the ylide. So perhaps the reaction is between the aldehyde and an ylide formed from another alkyl halide, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of H2O to form an alkene. But to eliminate water, you'd need an alcohol, which isn't indicated here.

Hmm.

Wait, another angle: The IR shows a C=O at 1720 cm-1. If the compound is a benzaldehyde, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might be introducing a chloride or bromide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard addition, but that typically uses magnesium, not red phosphorus and HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a vinyl group via elimination. But without an X leaving group, that's tricky.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the product is an alkene, but the options don't have alkenes. So perhaps the reaction is something else.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, the substituents are a sec-butyl group and a methyl group on the benzene ring, para to each other.

So, if the starting material is a benzaldehyde with a substituent, and the reaction replaces the aldehyde with a methyl group, perhaps via a reduction. But how would that happen with red phosphorus and HI?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Clemmensen-like reduction, converting the aldehyde to a CH2 group, but that typically uses Zn(Hg)/HCl.

Wait, but perhaps red phosphorus and HI can act as a reducing agent. I'm not sure about that, but if that's the case, then the aldehyde would be reduced to a CH2 group, turning the benzaldehyde into toluene derivative.

So, if the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde, and the reaction reduces the aldehyde group to a methyl group, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is option D.

So, the reaction would change the CHO group to CH2CH3? No, wait, aldehyde reduction typically gives CH2OH, but under strong reducing conditions, it could give CH3.

Wait, the Clemmensen reduction reduces aldehydes to alkanes. So, benzaldehyde would become toluene. So, if the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is option D.

So, putting it all together:

Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde.

IR shows C=O (1720), O-H (if any?), and aromatic C=C.

NMR shows aldehyde proton (10.5 ppm), aromatic protons as doublets, and the substituent's CH2 and CH groups.

Reaction with red phosphorus and HI reduces the aldehyde to a CH2 group, but wait, no, wait: The Clemmensen reduction uses Zn(Hg)/HCl to reduce aldehydes to alkanes, but perhaps red phosphorus and HI can do a similar job.

But wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. But given the options, option D fits.

So, the product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


Compound X is identified based on its IR and NMR data. The IR spectrum shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (indicative of an O-H stretch, possibly from a carboxylic acid or aldehyde), 1720 cm⁻¹ (a strong C=O stretch, likely from an aldehyde or carboxylic acid), and peaks around 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ (aromatic C=C stretching). The NMR data includes a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (likely an aldehyde proton), doublets at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm (aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene), and signals for an aliphatic chain: a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H, terminal methyl), a doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H, methyl attached to a CH), a multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H, CH₂), and a multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H, CH). These signals suggest a para-substituted benzaldehyde with a sec-butyl group as the substituent.

When Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, the aldehyde group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃), resulting in the formation of 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. This matches option D, which is a para-substituted benzene with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group.

Critical analysis of the options:
- **Option A**: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid does not match the IR and NMR data, as it would have a carboxylic acid group with a proton around 12 ppm, not 10.5 ppm.
- **Option B**: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene does not match the NMR data, as it lacks an aldehyde proton at 10.5 ppm.
- **Option C**: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid would have a carboxylic acid proton around 12 ppm, which is inconsistent with the NMR data.
- **Option D**: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene matches the data after the reduction of the aldehyde group to a methyl group.

Thus, the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.

Answer: D
