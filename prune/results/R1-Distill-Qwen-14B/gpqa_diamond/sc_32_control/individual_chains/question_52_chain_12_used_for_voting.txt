Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Okay, the question is about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star affect the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. 

Wait, alright, so the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its Teff is 6000K, but when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Then, the ratio of Ti neutral atoms in two levels decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

I remember that the ratio of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2-E1)/(k*T)), right? So, the ratio depends on the temperature and the statistical weights of the levels.

The problem states that when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature decreases. So, I guess when it's not spotted, the temperature is higher (6000K) and when it's spotted, lower (5500K). The ratio n1/n2 (or n2/n1, depending on how it's defined) would change with temperature.

Wait, the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the temperature goes down, the ratio goes down. That makes sense because when temperature decreases, the exponential factor exp(-ΔE/(kT)) would decrease. So, n2/n1 would decrease as T decreases, assuming that the energy difference is positive.

But wait, the ratio observed is n1/n2 or n2/n1? The question says the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in level 1 and level 2. So, that's n1/n2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So, without spots, the ratio is higher.

Let me think. Without spots, T_eff is 6000 K. With spots, it's 5500 K. So, the ratio n1/n2 is higher when T is higher because the exponential term becomes larger when T is higher.

Wait, no. Let's re-examine the formula. The ratio n2/n1 is (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE = E2-E1. So, if E2 > E1, then ΔE is positive. When T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio n2/n1 increases. So, higher T leads to more population in the upper level (n2) compared to the lower level (n1), making the ratio n2/n1 larger.

Alternatively, n1/n2 would be the inverse. So, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(kT)).

Wait, so when T increases, exp(ΔE/(kT)) increases, so n1/n2 increases. No, wait: if T increases, the denominator in the exponent becomes larger, so the exponent itself becomes smaller. So if ΔE is positive, then ΔE/(kT) is positive but smaller as T increases.

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose E2-E1 = 10 eV. For T = 6000 K, k is about 8.617e-5 eV/K. So k*T is about 8.617e-5 * 6000 = 0.517 eV. So ΔE/(kT) is about 10 / 0.517 ≈ 19.3.

If T drops to 5500 K, k*T is 8.617e-5 *5500 = approx 0.474 eV. So 10/0.474≈21.1. So, the exponent increases, making the exponential term larger. So, n1/n2 = (g1/g2)*exp(ΔE/(kT)). So, when T goes down, exp(ΔE/(kT)) increases, so n1/n2 goes up.

Wait, but the problem says that when there are spots (lower T), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Hmm, that contradicts the earlier reasoning. So perhaps I'm getting the ratio backwards.

Wait, the question says the ratio of n1 to n2 decreases when the star has spots. So, in the spotted case, n1/n2 is lower. So, when T is 5500 K, n1/n2 is lower than when T is 6000 K. But according to my earlier calculation, n1/n2 should increase when T decreases because the exponent increases, making exp(ΔE/(kT)) larger. So, that's confusing. 

Wait, perhaps I got the energy levels wrong. Maybe level 2 is higher than level 1, but the transition is from level 2 to level 1. Oh, wait, no. The transition is between two energy levels, and the wavelength is 1448 Å, which is in the near UV. Titanium lines in that range are probably from neutral Ti, so Ti I. 

Wait, but maybe the actual energy difference is small, so the ratio is more sensitive to the temperature. Alternatively, perhaps the energy level transition is E1 to E2, but I'm not sure which is higher. Hmm, let me think. If the transition is from E2 to E1, then E2 must be higher than E1 because emission lines come from higher levels, but in LTE, we usually have absorption lines, so E2 is higher than E1.

Wait, in the Boltzmann equation, the ratio is about the population in the upper level to the lower level. So (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, in this case, when T increases, the exponential term becomes smaller because the denominator is bigger. So at higher T, more population is in the upper level (n2) relative to n1. So, the ratio (n2/n1) is higher when T is higher.

But the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio of n1/n2 (if that's what's being observed) decreases. So, when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower. That would imply that (n2/n1) is higher when T is lower. But according to our formula, (n2/n1) would be lower when T is lower because the exponent is more negative, so the exponential term is smaller.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the ratio the other way around. The question says the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in level 1 and level 2. So that's n1/n2. And this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when T is lower (5500K), n1/n2 is lower than when T is 6000K.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, because n2/n1 = (g2/g2) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), so n1/n2 = [g1/g2] * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) decreases. Therefore, n1/n2 decreases as T increases. Wait, but that's the opposite of what the problem states.

Wait, the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, when the Teff is lower (5500K), the ratio is lower than when it's higher (6000K). But according to the formula, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, if T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so the exponent increases, making exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) ) larger, so n1/n2 increases. But according to the problem, when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio is lower. So that contradicts the formula.

Hmm, so perhaps I have the energy levels mixed up. Maybe E1 is higher than E2. Because if E1 is higher than E2, then (E2 - E1) is negative. So, in that case, (E2-E1) = - (E1-E2). So, the ratio becomes n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E1-E2)/(k T) )

So, if E1 > E2, then (E1-E2) is positive. So, when T increases, the exponent (- (E1-E2)/(k T) ) becomes a smaller negative number, so the exponential becomes larger. So, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T) )

Wait, maybe the transition is from a higher energy level to a lower one, which would mean that E2 is lower than E1. So, E2 < E1.

So, let's say E2 is lower. So, (E2 - E1) is negative.

So, for n1 and n2: n1 is the number in the higher level (E1), and n2 is the number in the lower level (E2). Because the transition is from higher to lower, which would be typical for absorption lines.

Wait, no, in the Boltzmann equation, n1 is the number in level 1, n2 in level 2. So, perhaps level 1 is higher than level 2. So, E1 > E2.

So, in that case, (E2-E1) is negative. So, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) 

So, when T increases, (E1-E2)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent becomes less negative. So, the exponential increases. So, n1/n2 increases as T increases.

But the problem says that when the star has spots (T=5500 K), the ratio decreases. So, when T is lower, the ratio is lower. So, that matches the formula.

Wait, no. Let me see. If E1 > E2, then (E1-E2)/(k T) is positive. So, the exponent is negative. So, as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative. So, the exponential term increases. So, n1/n2 increases as T increases.

Wait, but when the star has spots, T is lower, so the exponent is more negative. So, the exponential term is smaller, so n1/n2 is smaller. That matches the problem statement. So, the ratio n1/n2 is smaller when T is lower.

So, in this scenario, when the star is without spots (higher T), the ratio is larger. So, the factor by which the ratio changes is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = [ (g1/g2) exp( - (E1-E2)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( - (E1-E2)/(k T2) ) ]

The (g1/g2) terms cancel out, so the factor is exp [ ( (E1-E2)/(k) ) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ]

Wait, because when we take the ratio, it's exp( (E1-E2)/(k) (1/T_spot - 1/T_no_spot) ) )

Wait, let me compute that. Let me denote T1 = 6000 K (no spots), T2 =5500 K (spots).

So, the ratio is [n1/n2]_no_spots / [n1/n2]_spots = exp( (E1-E2)/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Wait, because in the exponent for each case, it is - (E1-E2)/(k T) . So when we take the ratio, it's exp( [ - (E1-E2)/(k T1) ] ) / exp( [ - (E1-E2)/(k T2) ] ) = exp( [ (E1-E2)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] )

So, that's the factor.

Now, to compute this, we need to find (E1-E2), which can be found from the wavelength of the transition. The energy difference ΔE = E1 - E2 corresponds to the photon emitted when an electron falls from E1 to E2. The energy of the photon is E_photon = hc/λ.

So, λ is given as approximately 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters. So, compute E_photon = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant ≈ 6.626e-34 J·s
c is speed of light ≈ 3e8 m/s
λ = 1448e-10 m.

So, E_photon = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

But since we're dealing with energy differences in the Boltzmann factor, perhaps it's better to express this in eV. Let me compute E_photon in eV.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So, E_photon = 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.56 eV.

So, ΔE = E1 - E2 ≈ 8.56 eV.

But wait, actually, no. Because the photon emitted is when an electron drops from E1 to E2. So, the energy of the photon is E_photon = E1 - E2 = ΔE = 8.56 eV.

So, ΔE = 8.56 eV.

But wait, wait. I think I made a mistake in the units. Let me recompute E_photon. Because 1448 Å is 1448 * 1e-10 meters = 1.448e-7 meters.

Wait, E_photon = hc / λ = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m) = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.448e-7 m) ) = approximately 1.373e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = 8.57 eV.

So, yes, ΔE is about 8.57 eV.

Now, Boltzmann's constant k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So, the exponent becomes (ΔE / (k)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Let me compute this step by step.

Compute 1/T2 -1/T1.

T2 = 5500 K, so 1/T2 ≈ 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4 K^-1

T1 = 6000 K, so 1/T1 ≈ 1.6667e-4 K^-1

So, 1/T2 - 1/T1 ≈ (1.818e-4 - 1.6667e-4) = 0.1513e-4 K^-1 ≈ 1.513e-5 K^-1.

Now, compute (ΔE /k) * (1.513e-5 )

ΔE = 8.57 eV

k = 8.617e-5 eV/K

So, (8.57 / 8.617e-5 ) → Let's compute 8.57 / 8.617e-5.

8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ approximately 100,000 * (8.57 / 86.17 ) ≈ 100,000 * 0.099 ≈ 9900.

Wait, let me compute it exactly.

8.57 / 8.617e-5 = 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ 

Well, 0.00008617 is 8.617e-5.

So, 8.57 / 8.617e-5 = (8.57 / 8.617) * 1e5 ≈ (0.9945) * 1e5 ≈ 99450.

So, approximately 99,450.

Multiply by (1.513e-5) → 

99,450 * 1.513e-5 = 99,450 * 1.513 * 1e-5.

Calculate 99,450 * 1.513:

99,450 * 1.5 = 149,175.

99,450 * 0.013 = approx 1292.85.

So, total is approximately 149,175 + 1,292.85 = 150,467.85.

Multiply by 1e-5 → 150,467.85e-5 = 15.046785.

So, the exponent is approximately 15.047.

So, the factor is exp(15.047) ≈ e^15.047.

But wait, e^15 is a huge number. Let me compute it.

e^10 ≈ 22026
e^15 ≈ e^10 * e^5 ≈ 22026 * 148.413 ≈ 3,269,017.

Wait, 148.413 is e^5.

So, e^15 ≈ 3,269,017.

But wait, our exponent is 15.047, which is 15 + 0.047.

e^0.047 ≈ 1.048.

So, e^15.047 ≈ 3,269,017 * 1.048 ≈ approximately 3,428,000.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options are around 1.1, 7.8, etc. So, I must have made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me recheck the steps.

First, the energy of the photon: E_photon = hc/λ.

Wait, I think I messed up the units. Let me recompute E_photon.

λ = 1448 Å = 1448 * 1e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

So, E_photon = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / 1.448e-7 m = 

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18 → approx 1.372e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = approx 8.567 eV.

So, ΔE = 8.567 eV.

k = 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So, (ΔE)/(k) = 8.567 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 8.567 / 0.00008617 ≈ 99,421 K.

Wait, 8.567 / 0.00008617 → let me compute:

0.00008617 is 8.617e-5.

So, 8.567 / 8.617e-5 = 8.567 / 0.00008617 = 8.567 * (1 / 0.00008617) ≈ 8.567 * 11,600 ≈ 99,250 K.

So, that's 99,250 K.

Then, (ΔE)/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) → 99,250 K * (1.513e-5 1/K) → 99,250 * 1.513e-5 ≈ 

Compute 99,250 * 1.513e-5 = 99,250 * 0.00001513 ≈ 

Let me compute 99,250 * 0.00001 = 0.9925
99,250 * 0.00000513 = 99,250 *5.13e-6 → 

Compute 99,250 * 5.13e-6 → (99,250 *5.13) * 1e-6 → 

99,250 *5 = 496,250
99,250 *0.13 = 12,902.5
Total = 496,250 + 12,902.5 = 509,152.5 → 509,152.5e-6 → 0.5091525

So, total is 0.9925 + 0.5091525 ≈ 1.50165.

So, the exponent is approximately 1.50165.

So, exp(1.50165) ≈ e^1.50165 ≈ about e^1.5 is 4.4817, so about 4.48.

Wait, e^1.5 is approximately 4.4817.

So, the factor is approximately 4.48.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, so that's probably the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the exponent calculation.

Wait, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = 1/5500 - 1/6000.

Convert to common denominator:

(6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) ) = 500 / (33,000,000) ) = 5e2 / 3.3e7 = 5/(3.3e4) ) ≈ 1.515e-5.

Wait, 500 /33,000,000 = 5e2 / 3.3e7 → 5 / 3.3e5 → 5/(330,000) ≈ 0.0000151515 → 1.515e-5.

So, that's correct.

So, (ΔE/k) is about 99,250 K.

Multiply by 1.515e-5 1/K → 99,250 * 1.515e-5 = 99,250 * 0.00001515 → let's compute that.

99,250 * 0.00001 = 0.9925
99,250 * 0.00000515 = ?

0.00000515 = 5.15e-6.

99,250 *5.15e-6 = (99,250 *5) *1e-6 + (99,250 *0.15) *1e-6.

99,250 *5 = 496,250 → 496,250 *1e-6 = 0.49625.

99,250 *0.15 = 14,887.5 → 14,887.5 *1e-6 = 0.0148875.

So, total for this part is 0.49625 +0.0148875 = 0.5111375.

So, the total is 0.9925 + 0.5111375 = 1.5036375.

So, the exponent is 1.5036.

So, e^1.5036 ≈ e^1.5036.

We know that e^1.5 is about 4.4817.

Compute e^0.0036:

e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 for small x. So, x=0.0036.

e^0.0036 ≈ 1 + 0.0036 + 0.00000648 ≈ 1.00360648.

So, e^1.5036 ≈ e^1.5 * e^0.0036 ≈ 4.4817 *1.0036 ≈ 4.500.

Which is about 4.5.

So, the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from having no spots (Teff = 6000 K) to having spots (Teff = 5500 K), we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right)
\]

Here, \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) are the populations of the two energy levels, \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights, \(E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Steps:
1. **Energy Difference (\(E_2 - E_1\)):**  
   The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. Using the relation \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\), the energy is:

   \[
   E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}
   \]

   Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):

   \[
   E \approx \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}
   \]

   Thus, \(E_2 - E_1 = 8.56 \, \text{eV}\).

2. **Boltzmann Factor Exponent:**  
   The ratio of populations changes by a factor of:

   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right)
   \]

   Substituting \(E_2 - E_1 = 8.56 \, \text{eV}\), \(k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}\), \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\), and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\):

   \[
   \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.513 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}
   \]

   \[
   \frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} = \frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99,450 \, \text{K}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Exponent} = 99,450 \times 1.513 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.5036
   \]

3. **Compute the Factor:**  
   The factor is:

   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp(1.5036) \approx 4.5
   \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star transitions from having no spots to having spots.

**Answer: C**
