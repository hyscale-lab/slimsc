Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products are formed. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

First, I need to figure out what the structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d is. Wait, wait—1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, right! That's a benzene ring with a bromine substituent on carbon 1 and a deuterium (d) on carbon 2. Wait, wait, or is the 'd' part of the name indicating something else? Hmm. Oh, wait, maybe it's a typo or perhaps it's 2-dimethylamino? No, no, the 'd' here probably stands for deuterium. So it's a benzene ring where one of the hydrogens is replaced by a deuterium. So, the structure is bromobenzene with a deuterium on the adjacent carbon.

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The name is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So benzene with bromine at position 1, and deuterium at position 2. So positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, right? So it's a bromobenzene where the ortho position has a deuterium instead of a hydrogen. So the structure is a benzene ring with Br on carbon 1, and D (deuterium) on carbon 2.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. In aromatic chemistry, especially with deuterium, this might be about some kind of elimination or substitution.

Wait, but this compound has a deuterium attached to the ring. So when NaNH2 is used, which is a strong base, perhaps it abstracts a proton. But wait, the only deuterium is on C2. Wait, but in aromatic systems, sometimes reactions can occur through elimination or substitution if there's a good leaving group. Wait, but bromine is a good leaving group; if the base abstracts a proton, could it lead to some kind of elimination?

Wait, but in benzene rings, especially with halogens, I'm thinking about possible elimination to form a benzyn intermediate or some kind of aromatic elimination product. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, let's think. 1-bromobenzene-2-d: Br is at position 1, D is at position 2. Now, when treated with NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a strong base. So the base could abstract a proton adjacent to the leaving group (Br), leading to elimination. Wait, but the only H adjacent to Br is at position 2, but that's a D here. So that's a deuterium, which isn't as acidic as H, but NaNH2 is a very strong base. Hmmm.

Wait, wait, but wait. Wait—if the hydrogen is replaced by deuterium, maybe the base can't abstract that. So perhaps the reaction is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates another position. Wait, but in this molecule, all other positions are H except for 1 (Br) and 2 (D). So positions 3,4,5,6 have H's. So maybe the base abstracts a proton from another position, but how does that lead to elimination?

Wait, another thought: Elimination reactions usually require the leaving group and a hydrogen on the adjacent carbon. But in this case, the adjacent carbon (position 2) has a deuterium. So if the base can't abstract that (since D is less acidic than H), then maybe this position isn't available for elimination.

Hmm, so perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via elimination, but maybe via a substitution. Wait, but in aromatic substitution, you usually have something like nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires activating groups. Bromine is a deactivating group, so nucleophilic substitution is unlikely unless there are strong activating groups, which there aren't here.

Wait, wait a minute, another possibility: the deuterium isn't the key here. Maybe the reaction is about an elimination to form a benzyn (aryne) intermediate. But for that, you typically need two leaving groups or a dihalobenzene. Wait, but here we have only one bromine. So that might not work.

Wait, perhaps the deuterium is involved in some kind of isotope effect. But I'm not sure how that would affect the reaction here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but that requires adjacent leaving groups. Wait, in benzene, elimination would require two adjacent leaving groups. Since there's only one Br and a D next to it, perhaps that's not possible.

Wait, another angle: in some cases, when a ring has a leaving group and a deuterium on the adjacent carbon, and a strong base is present, perhaps the base abstracts a proton that's not adjacent, leading to some kind of shift or rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the Br isn't the leaving group but the D is. No, that doesn't make sense because D isn't a good leaving group.

Wait, perhaps this is a case of ortho elimination. For example, in some cases, when a strong base is present, a leaving group (like Br) and a H (or D) on adjacent positions can lead to elimination of HBr and formation of a triple bond (aryne). But in this case, the H is a D, so maybe the reaction is possible but with a different isotope.

Wait, but wait, if the base abstracts the H (but it's D here), so maybe that's not feasible. So perhaps the reaction doesn't occur? But that can't be right because the options don't have zero as an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the reaction conditions again. NaNH2 in condensed ammonia is a common condition for dehydrohalogenation to form arynes. If the starting material is a dihalide, like 1,2-dibromobenzene, then eliminating two bromides (or a bromide and a hydrogen) would form benzene with a triple bond (aryne). But in this case, we have only one bromide and a D in the ortho position.

So, perhaps the reaction is:

Br-C1 and D-C2. The base (NaNH2) abstracts a proton from, say, C3. But how would that lead to elimination? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another thought: maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from a position that's meta or para to Br, but that might not be adjacent, so elimination would not occur. So perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as elimination, so no product is formed. But the options don't have zero, so perhaps this isn't the case.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of the reaction as a simple substitution. But in aromatic substitution, under what conditions does that occur? Oh, perhaps it's a case of elimination leading to a benzyn intermediate, but only if two adjacent leaving groups are present. Since we have only one Br and a D, perhaps no elimination occurs. So then, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the D is not affecting the reaction, and the Br is being eliminated. Wait, but in that case, what's the product? Let me think. If elimination occurs, perhaps the Br leaves, and the ring forms a triple bond. But for that, you need a hydrogen to be abstracted from the adjacent position. But since the adjacent position is D, which is a heavier isotope, perhaps the base can't abstract it as easily. So maybe this reaction doesn't proceed.

Hmm, but I'm not confident. Maybe I should think about the possibility of multiple products. If the base abstracts a hydrogen from another position, leading to different elimination products. Wait, but in which positions could that happen?

Wait, another approach: the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Let's imagine the structure:

Positions 1: Br, 2: D, others: H.

When treated with NaNH2, which is a strong base, perhaps it abstracts a proton from the ring. The deprotonation could occur at positions that are meta or para to the Br, but more likely at positions that are ortho or para to the Br because those positions are more acidic due to the electron-withdrawing effect of Br.

Wait, but the Br is at position 1. So the ortho positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 has a D, so the base can't abstract that. Position 6 has a H, so perhaps that's abstracted.

If the base abstracts a H from position 6, then that would set up for elimination between positions 1 (Br) and 6 (now a carbanion). Wait, but that's not adjacent positions. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a H from position 3 or 5, which are meta to Br. But those positions are less acidic, so maybe the base isn't strong enough to abstract them. But NaNH2 is a very strong base, so perhaps it can.

Wait, but if the base abstracts a H from position 3, then we have a carbanion there. But how would that lead to elimination? Because elimination usually requires the leaving group to be adjacent to the abstracted H. So if the H is at position 3 and the leaving group is at position 1, they're not adjacent, so elimination wouldn't occur. So perhaps that doesn't lead to any product.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the possible products. If elimination occurs, the product would be a benzyn (aryne) with a triple bond between C1 and C2. But wait, C2 has a D, so when eliminating, would that D stay or leave?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is as follows: the base abstracts a proton from position 2 (but it's a D, so maybe that's not possible). Alternatively, maybe the D doesn't react, and the base abstracts a proton from position 6, leading to a carbanion there. Then elimination occurs between C1 and C6, but they're not adjacent, so that can't form a triple bond. So this might not be feasible.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton from position 4, which is para to the Br at position 1. Then, could elimination occur between position 1 and position 4? But that's not adjacent either, so again, no.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should consider another possibility. If the Br is at position 1 and the D is at position 2, maybe the reaction leads to substitution of the Br. But Br is a poor leaving group for nucleophilic substitution on aromatic rings because the ring is deactivated. However, under strong basic conditions, perhaps an elimination occurs, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the deuterium doesn't affect the reaction much, and the reaction is similar to the normal bromobenzene undergoing elimination. But in that case, the product would be benzyn (aryne) with a triple bond between C1 and C2. But since in this case, position 2 has a D, maybe the elimination leads to a different product.

Wait, but in the normal elimination, you lose H and Br from adjacent positions. If the H is replaced with D, perhaps the elimination is less likely, but maybe it can still happen. So the product would be benzene with a triple bond between C1 and C2, but with the D now at position 2. Wait, but after elimination, position 2 would be part of the triple bond, so the D would be incorporated into the ring as part of the triple bond.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let me think again. The reaction is dehydrohalogenation, losing H and Br to form a triple bond. So, the H must be from an adjacent position. But in this case, position 2 has a D, so the H needed for elimination is not present. So perhaps the reaction can't proceed, and no elimination occurs. But that would mean no product, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the D is not removed, and the Br leaves, but without the H, you can't form the triple bond. So perhaps this leads to a substitution product instead.

Wait, but substitution would require a nucleophile. NaNH2 is a base, maybe acting as a source of NH2- ions? So perhaps the bromide leaves, and the NH2- attacks the ring. But in aromatic substitution, that's nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which typically requires activating groups. But Br is a deactivating group, so unless the ring is strongly activated, this might not happen. So perhaps substitution isn't a viable pathway here.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of another angle. Maybe the presence of D affects the reaction in some way. For example, in certain elimination reactions, the isotope effect can influence the reaction rate. But in this case, since the H adjacent to Br is replaced with D, perhaps the reaction is slower or doesn't proceed. So no elimination, no product. But again, the options don't include zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the D doesn't affect the reaction, and the product is just benzene with a triple bond between 1 and 2, making one product. But wait, let's think about the structure. If elimination occurs between C1 and C2, the product would be a benzyn with a triple bond there, but since position 2 had a D, perhaps the D is incorporated into the structure somehow.

Wait, but in the elimination, both the Br and the H (or D) are removed as HBr (or DBr). So if the H is D, then we'd lose DBr, and form a triple bond between C1 and C2. So the product would be benzyn with a triple bond between 1 and 2. But wait, in this case, the H (D) being removed is from position 2, which is adjacent to Br at 1. So the product would be benzene with a triple bond between 1 and 2, and the D would be gone as DBr.

So that would give a single product, right? So the product is benzyn with the triple bond between C1 and C2, and the D is removed as DBr. So only one product.

Wait, but wait a second. If the base abstracts the D from position 2, that's not likely because D is less acidic than H. So perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via elimination because the base can't abstract the D. So no elimination, so no product. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, so there are no products. But the options don't have zero as an option. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't about elimination but a different type of substitution. For example, maybe the Br is replaced by NH2- from NaNH2. But wait, that's nucleophilic substitution, which for aromatic rings requires strong activating groups. Since Br is electron-withdrawing, that would deactivate the ring, making substitution unlikely.

Hmm... Maybe I should think about the possibility of multiple products. For example, if the base abstracts a proton from position 3 or 4, leading to different sites of elimination or substitution. But without a good leaving group adjacent to those positions, I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: in some cases, the base could deprotonate and form a benzene ring with a negative charge, which could lead to some kind of rearrangement. But without a good leaving group nearby, I'm not sure what would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves the deuterium in a different way. Maybe it's a case of H/D exchange, but under basic conditions, that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a simple elimination to form benzyn, but with the D in position 2, but that's the same product regardless of the position of D. So the product would be benzyn with the triple bond between C1 and C2. So that's one product.

But wait, in the starting material, D is at C2. So after elimination, the D would be lost as DBr, and the triple bond would form between C1 and C2. So that's one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from another position, leading to elimination at a different site. But for that, the leaving group (Br) would have to be adjacent to the abstracted H. But since Br is at C1, the only adjacent H is at C2 (which is D here), so maybe no other elimination is possible.

So that would mean only one product is formed.

But wait, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Let's think about the positions again.

If elimination occurs between C1 (Br) and C2 (D), then the product would be benzyn with a triple bond between 1 and 2, and the D would be released as D– in some form. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the D would be part of the eliminated molecule.

Wait, but when elimination occurs between C1 and C2, both Br and H (or D) are removed. So the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between 1 and 2, and the byproduct would be HBr or DBr, depending on which H is abstracted.

But in this case, the only H adjacent to Br is position 2, which is D. So the base would abstract D, but since D is a poor proton donor, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed. Thus, no elimination, so no product. But again, that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction can still proceed, and the product is the benzyn, regardless of the presence of D. So only one product.

So the number of possible products would be 1.

Looking back at the options, option B is 1.

But wait, another thought: what if the base abstracts a proton from position 6, which is adjacent to position 1? No, position 6 is not adjacent to position 1 in a benzene ring. Wait, position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. Oh, right, so position 6 is adjacent to position 1. So if the base abstracts a proton from position 6, which has a H, then elimination could occur between position 1 (Br) and position 6 (H). That would form a triple bond between C1 and C6. But wait, that's across the ring, not adjacent. No, wait, position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. So 1 and 6 are adjacent. So if the H is at 6, then elimination between 1 and 6 would form a triple bond between 1 and 6.

Wait, but in the starting material, position 2 has D, position 6 has H.

So if the base abstracts the H from position 6, then elimination occurs between 1 (Br) and 6 (H), forming a triple bond between 1 and 6. That would give a different product than if the H was abstracted from position 2 (but that's D, so that can't happen).

So in this case, the base could abstract H from position 6, leading to elimination and forming a triple bond between 1 and 6. So the product would be benzene with a triple bond between 1 and 6.

Wait, but wait, the positions are 1 (Br), 2 (D), and 6 (H). So if the base abstracts the H from position 6, then elimination occurs between 1 and 6, forming a triple bond between them. That would give a new product.

But wait, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, so positions are 1 (Br), 2 (D), 3 (H?), 4 (H?), 5 (H?), 6 (H?).

So when the base abstracts a proton from position 6, elimination occurs, removing Br and H from 6, forming a triple bond between 1 and 6. So the product would be benzyn with triple bond between 1 and 6, and the D would still be at position 2. So that's another product.

Wait, but can the base abstract a proton from position 6? Because position 6 is adjacent to the Br at position 1, making that H more acidic. So yes, the base might abstract that H, leading to elimination and a triple bond between 1 and 6.

So now I have two possible products: one with the triple bond between 1 and 2, and another between 1 and 6. But wait, in the starting material, position 2 has a D, so the H at position 6 is available. So that's possible.

Wait, but wait, position 2 has D, so if the base abstracts H from position 6, elimination between 1 and 6 (adjacent) would form a triple bond between 1 and 6. So that's one product.

But wait, if the base abstracts H from position 6, the product would be benzene with a triple bond between 1 and 6. So that's one product.

Additionally, could the base abstract H from position 4? Because position 4 is para to Br at position 1. If the base abstracts H from position 4, then elimination would occur between position 1 and position 4, but those are not adjacent. So that can't form a triple bond, so elimination isn't possible. So that wouldn't form a product.

Wait, but maybe the base could abstract H from position 3 or 5, but those are meta to Br, which are less acidic, so the strong base NaNH2 might still abstract them. But then, elimination would require the H and Br to be adjacent, which they aren't. So no elimination, so no product.

So the only possible eliminations are between 1 and 2 (but position 2 has D, so H isn't available) and between 1 and 6 (H available at 6, so elimination is possible).

Wait, but position 2 has D, so the H at position 6 is available. So elimination can occur between 1 and 6, giving a triple bond between them. So that's one product.

Wait, but what about position 2? If the H there is a D, then the base can't abstract it, so elimination between 1 and 2 isn't possible. So only elimination between 1 and 6 is possible, leading to one product.

Wait, but earlier I thought that elimination between 1 and 2 would give a product, but position 2's H is a D, so elimination isn't possible there. So only one product is possible.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, if the base abstracts H from position 6, which is adjacent to Br at 1, then elimination would occur, forming a triple bond between 1 and 6. That's one product.

Wait, but what about the possibility of the base abstracting H from position 2, but since it's a D, that's not possible. So elimination can't happen there. So only one product is formed.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Structure: Br at 1, D at 2, H at 6.

So, when NaNH2 is added, the base abstracts H from position 6, leading to elimination between 1 and 6, forming a triple bond. So product is benzene with triple bond between 1 and 6.

Alternatively, could the base abstract a H from a different position, leading to a different product? Like position 3 or 4.

Wait, position 3 is meta to Br. If the base abstracts H from position 3, then elimination would require Br and H to be adjacent, which they aren't. So no elimination, no product.

Same with position 4: para to Br, but not adjacent, so no elimination.

Position 5: adjacent to position 6, which is H. If the base abstracts H from position 5, then elimination would occur between 5 and 6. But Br is at 1, so that's not adjacent to either. So no elimination, no product.

Hmm, so the only possible elimination is between 1 and 6, leading to one product.

Wait, but wait. Could the base abstract a proton from position 3 or 5, leading to different products via some rearrangement?

Alternatively, perhaps the base can abstract a proton from position 4, which is para to Br. But again, that's not adjacent, so elimination isn't possible.

So, in total, the reaction would give only one product: benzyn with the triple bond between C1 and C6.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: the reaction forms benzyn, but in this case, the position of the triple bond depends on where the elimination occurs. So if elimination can occur at two different adjacent positions, you get two different products. But in this case, only position 6 has a H adjacent to Br. Position 2 has D, so elimination can only occur once, leading to one product.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that position 6 is the only possible site for H abstraction. If the base can abstract H from position 6, which is adjacent to Br, then elimination occurs, giving one product. If the base abstracts H from position 2 (but it's D, so can't), then no elimination. So only one product.

So the number of possible products is 1, which is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia. The starting material is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom at position 2. The reaction conditions suggest a strong base, which typically facilitates elimination or substitution reactions.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   - Bromine is at position 1 (C1), and deuterium is at position 2 (C2).  
   - All other positions (C3, C4, C5, C6) have hydrogen atoms.

2. **Reaction Conditions**:  
   - NaNH₂ is a strong base, commonly used for deprotonation and elimination reactions.  
   - In aromatic systems, elimination reactions often proceed via dehydrohalogenation to form benzynes (arynes) when adjacent leaving groups are present.

3. **Elimination Pathway**:  
   - Elimination requires a leaving group (Br) and a proton (H or D) on an adjacent carbon.  
   - Position 2 (C2) has a deuterium (D), which is less acidic than hydrogen (H). Since NaNH₂ is a strong base, it can abstract protons but not deuterium effectively.  
   - Therefore, elimination between C1 (Br) and C2 (D) is unlikely because the base cannot abstract the deuterium.

4. **Alternative Elimination Site**:  
   - The base can abstract a proton from position 6 (C6), which is adjacent to C1 (Br).  
   - This leads to elimination between C1 (Br) and C6 (H), forming a benzene ring with a triple bond (aryne) between C1 and C6.  
   - This is the only feasible elimination pathway under the given conditions.

5. **Other Positions**:  
   - Positions 3, 4, and 5 are either meta or para to the bromine and are less acidic. The base is unlikely to abstract protons from these positions, and elimination would not be possible due to the lack of adjacency to the bromine.

6. **Substitution Pathway**:  
   - Substitution reactions (e.g., nucleophilic aromatic substitution) are unlikely because bromine is a deactivating group, and the ring is not sufficiently activated for such a reaction under these conditions.

7. **Conclusion**:  
   - The reaction produces only one product: a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C6 (benzyn).  
   - No other elimination or substitution pathways are viable under the given conditions.

### Final Answer:
The number of possible organic products is **1**.  
**Answer: B**
