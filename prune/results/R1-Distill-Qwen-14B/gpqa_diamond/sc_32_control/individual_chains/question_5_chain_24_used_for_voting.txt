Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're interested in is +ħ/2. So, the operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given by 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. 

The options provided are all possible eigenvectors, and I need to determine which one is the correct normalized eigenvector.

Hmm, I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, the Pauli matrices are involved. Each component of the spin operator is proportional to these matrices. So, the given P_x, P_y, and P_z are probably the spin matrices scaled by ħ/2. 

Wait, but the problem says that the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. That direction can be represented as (n_x, 0, n_z), since it's in the x-z plane. So, the operator P would be the sum of the components multiplied by their respective direction vectors. 

The operator P can be written as P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z, because the direction has zero y-component. So, the operator we're interested in is the combination of P_x and P_z scaled by n_x and n_z respectively.

Each component is given as:
P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Since the direction is in the x-z plane, the operator is a combination of P_x and P_z. Let me write that out: 

P = n_x * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0],[0, -1]]

Which simplifies to:

P = (ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Because when you add the two matrices, the first element is n_z, the top right is n_x, the bottom left is n_x, and the bottom right is -n_z.

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So, we have:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] * |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Dividing both sides by ħ/2 gives:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |ψ> = |ψ>

So, the matrix [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] multiplied by the eigenvector equals the eigenvector itself.

The eigenvector equation is thus:

n_z * a + n_x * b = a  
n_x * a + (-n_z)*b = b

Where the eigenvector |ψ> is [a, b]^T.

So, substituting the equations:

Equation 1: n_z a + n_x b = a → (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0  
Equation 2: n_x a - n_z b = b → n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0  

Let me take equation 1: (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0  
Equation 2: n_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0  

Wait, maybe I should write this as a system:

Equation 1: (n_z -1) a = -n_x b  
Equation 2: n_x a = (n_z +1) b  

Hmm, perhaps I can express a in terms of b from equation 2 and substitute into equation 1.

From equation 2: a = (n_z +1) b / n_x 

Wait, but n_x and n_z are direction cosines. Since the direction vector is in x-z plane, the magnitude of n is sqrt(n_x^2 + n_z^2) = 1. So, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1.

So, n_x = cos(theta), n_z = sin(theta) if theta is the angle from the z-axis. Alternatively, considering the x-z plane, perhaps n_x is the x-component, n_z the z-component. 

Wait, but in the problem, the direction is arbitrary, so perhaps the eigenvector will depend on the direction angles. But looking at the options, some have cos(theta), sin(theta), etc. 

Wait, but I need to find the normalized eigenvector. Let me proceed.

So, from equation 2: a = [ (n_z +1) / n_x ] * b 

Substituting into equation 1: (n_z -1) * [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b + n_x b = 0 

Simplify: 

[ (n_z^2 -1 ) / n_x + n_x ] b = 0 

But since n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, n_z^2 =1 -n_x^2. So:

( (1 - n_x^2) -1 ) /n_x +n_x = ( -n_x^2 ) /n_x +n_x = -n_x +n_x =0 

So, the equation reduces to 0*b = 0, which is always true. That suggests that the system is dependent, and we can choose a parameter to find the eigenvectors.

So, the eigenvectors are determined up to a scalar multiple. Let's express a in terms of b.

From equation 2: a = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b 

But wait, I should think of the eigenvectors as being proportional to [ (n_z +1), n_x ]^T or something similar. Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently.

Wait, the matrix for P is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]], and we're looking for eigenvectors with eigenvalue 1 (since we divided by ħ/2). So, the equation is (P_matrix - I) |ψ> =0.

The matrix P_matrix - I is [[n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1]]

So, the determinant of (P_matrix - I) must be zero for non-trivial solutions. Let's compute the determinant:

det = (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) - (n_x)^2 

= [ (-n_z^2 -n_z + n_z +1 ) ] - n_x^2 

Wait, expanding (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) = (-n_z)(n_z) -n_z (1) + (-1)(-n_z) + (-1)(1) 

Wait, better to compute it as (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) = -(n_z^2 -1) = -(n_z^2 -1) 

So, determinant is -(n_z^2 -1) -n_x^2 

= -n_z^2 +1 -n_x^2 

But since n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, substitute:

= -(n_z^2 +n_x^2) +1 +1? Wait, no, let me check:

Wait, n_x^2 +n_z^2=1, so -n_z^2 -n_x^2 = -1. So, determinant is -1 +1 =0.

Which makes sense since we're considering an eigenvalue, so the determinant is zero. 

So, the eigenvectors must satisfy the equation from the first row: (n_z -1) a +n_x b =0 → (n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [n_x/(1 -n_z)] b 

Assuming 1 -n_z ≠0. So, the eigenvector can be written as [n_x/(1 -n_z) b, b]^T.

So, the vector is proportional to [n_x, (1 -n_z)]^T. Because if I factor out b, I have [n_x/(1-n_z), 1]^T multiplied by b. So, the eigenvector is proportional to (n_x, 1 -n_z).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake there. Let me think again. 

If a = [n_x / (1 -n_z)] b, then the vector [a, b] is proportional to [n_x, (1 -n_z)].

So, the eigenvector can be written as [n_x, 1 -n_z]^T, multiplied by a scalar.

But wait, that's an eigenvector. But I need to normalize it. So, the norm of the vector is sqrt( n_x^2 + (1 -n_z)^2 )

Let me compute that:

n_x^2 + (1 -n_z)^2 = n_x^2 + 1 -2n_z +n_z^2 

But n_x^2 +n_z^2 =1, so substituting:

= 1 +1 -2n_z 

= 2(1 -n_z)

So, the norm is sqrt(2(1 -n_z)).

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), (1 -n_z)/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) ]^T 

Simplify:

= [n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), 1 / sqrt(2) ]^T

Wait, because (1-n_z)/sqrt(2(1-n_z)) = sqrt( (1-n_z)/(2(1-n_z)) ) ) → sqrt(1/(2)) → 1/sqrt(2). 

So, the normalized eigenvector is (n_x / sqrt(2(1-n_z)) , 1/sqrt(2) )^T.

But wait, that can't be right. Let me check again.

Wait, n_x^2 + (1 -n_z)^2 = 2(1 -n_z)

So, when I take the square root, the norm is sqrt(2(1 -n_z)).

So, each component is divided by that. 

So, a = n_x / sqrt(2(1-n_z))  
b = (1 -n_z) / sqrt(2(1-n_z)) ) 

Which simplifies to:

a = n_x / sqrt{ 2(1 -n_z) },  
b = sqrt( (1-n_z) / 2 )

Wait, no. Because (1-n_z) divided by sqrt(2(1-n_z)) is sqrt( (1-n_z)^2 ) / sqrt(2(1-n_z)) ) → (1-n_z) / sqrt(2(1-n_z)) ) = sqrt( (1-n_z)/2 )

Similarly, a is n_x / sqrt( 2(1 -n_z) )

But n_x = cos(theta), since in the x-z plane, the direction can be parameterized by theta, the angle from the z-axis. So, n_x = sin(theta) if we're measuring from z? Wait, no. Wait, n_x is the x-component, which is cos(theta), where theta is the angle from the z-axis. Because in the x-z plane, theta is the polar angle in spherical coordinates. So, n_x = cos(theta), n_z = sin(theta).

Wait, no. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the polar angle theta is measured from the z-axis. So, for a point in the x-z plane, the coordinates are (r sin(theta) cos(phi), 0, r cos(theta)) ), but since phi is zero or pi, but in this case, the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane, so phi can be any angle, but the direction is in x-z, so phi =0 for simplicity, but the eigenvector should be expressed in terms of theta.

Wait, perhaps theta is the angle from the z-axis. So, n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta).

Wait, let me think again. Let me imagine the unit vector in the x-z plane. The direction can be given by theta, the angle from the z-axis. So, the components would be:

n_x = sin(theta) * cos(phi)  
n_y = 0  
n_z = cos(theta)

But in our case, the direction is arbitrary, so phi can vary, but since the operator is along an arbitrary n in x-z plane, the eigenvector would depend on theta and phi.

Wait, but the problem asks for the eigenvector in general, so perhaps the answer will involve trigonometric functions of theta and phi.

But looking at the options, option C and B involve sin(theta/2) and cos(theta/2), which makes me think of spin-1/2 systems and their eigenvectors.

Wait, another approach: the eigenvectors of the Pauli matrices are known. For example, the eigenstates of S·n (where n is a unit vector) are given by the spin-up and spin-down states along n. 

The spin-up state along n is (e^{-i phi/2} cos(theta/2), e^{i phi/2} sin(theta/2) )^T, and the spin-down is (e^{-i phi/2} sin(theta/2), -e^{i phi/2} cos(theta/2) )^T.

But wait, the operator given here is P, which is proportional to the spin operator. So, the eigenstates are spin-up and spin-down along n.

So, the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 is the spin-up state along n, which is (e^{-i phi/2} cos(theta/2), e^{i phi/2} sin(theta/2) )^T.

Looking at the options, option C is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), but that would be the case for phi=0. Option B has e^{i phi}, which is the same as e^{i phi/2} if phi is doubled?

Wait, let me think. The general expression is: 

|+n> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T

Wait, no, the correct expansion is:

|+n> = e^{-i phi/2} [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T

Wait, perhaps the correct expression is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T multiplied by a normalization factor. Wait, but in any case, the form depends on theta and phi, and the options don't have all four, but looking at the options:

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) )

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Hmm, but in the spin-up state, it's [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but without the exponential, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvector is given in terms of the direction angles theta and phi.

Wait, but the question asks about the normalized eigenvector. So, the correct form would involve cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), each multiplied by a phase factor involving phi.

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but that's without the exponential. Option B has (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is similar to the components of a vector in spherical coordinates, but not exactly matching the spin state.

Wait, but the operator is given as a vector operator along n, which is in x-z plane. The spin-up state would have components based on theta and phi. So, the eigenvector would be a linear combination of the spin matrices along n.

Wait, maybe I should write the general form. For the spin-up state along n, the components are:

|+> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T

So, the components are cos(theta/2) and e^{i phi} sin(theta/2). 

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is similar but without the exponential. However, option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is scaled differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvector is ( sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2) ), which is option D. But wait, why would hbar be involved in the eigenvector? Because the components of the operator are scaled by ħ/2, but the eigenvector is a dimensionless vector.

So, the presence of hbar in the options is confusing. Because eigenvectors are typically dimensionless. So, options A and D have hbar in them, which might be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the operator components are given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2, but the eigenvector is a vector in spin space, which is dimensionless.

So, options with hbar in them would be incorrect. So, options A and D can be ruled out because they include hbar factors.

So, the possible correct options are B and C.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches the spin-up state's form, except for the phase factor. But perhaps the question assumes phi=0, or perhaps the phase factor is represented differently.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which looks more like a spherical coordinate representation, but scaled by theta instead of theta/2.

Wait, but the spin-up state is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T, so option C is the case when phi=0, but the question states an arbitrary direction, so phi is included.

But looking at the options, none of them include the exponential with phi/2.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the spin state without the phase. Alternatively, perhaps the given operator is in the computational basis, and the eigenvector might not have the exponential factor if the direction is along the x-z plane.

Wait, but the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane, so phi is any angle. So, the exponential factor must be present.

Looking again at the options:

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) )

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

So, if the correct form is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T, then option C is the case when phi=0. But the problem states an arbitrary direction, so the correct option should have the exponential with phi.

But none of the options except B have an exponential. So, perhaps I was mistaken earlier.

Wait, perhaps the eigenvector given in the options is not in that form. Let me think about how the eigenvectors are formed when the operator is along a direction in the x-z plane.

Wait, another approach: since the operator is along n = (n_x, 0, n_z), the eigenstates can be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of S_x, S_y, and S_z.

But perhaps another way to write the eigenvector is to choose the eigenstate of S·n, which is a spin-1/2 system. The eigenstates are known to be:

|+> = ( e^{-i phi/2} cos(theta/2), e^{i phi/2} sin(theta/2) )^T

But this is the same as [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T, because e^{i phi/2} is the factor, but when you factor out e^{-i phi/2} from both components, it doesn't change the vector direction.

Wait, perhaps the eigenvector is written as [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T, but the options don't have that form.

Looking at option B: ( cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) )

That would correspond to theta being twice the polar angle. Because if you let theta' = theta/2, then cos(theta) = 2 cos^2(theta/2) -1, which isn't directly matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the initial approach.

The eigenvector I derived earlier is [n_x, 1 -n_z]^T, normalized by sqrt(2(1 -n_z)).

But n_x = sin(theta) if theta is measured from z-axis, because in the x-z plane, the angle theta would be between the direction vector and the z-axis, making n_z = cos(theta), n_x = sin(theta).

Wait, let me clarify:

If theta is the angle between the direction vector n and the z-axis, then:

n_x = |n| sin(theta) cos(phi) , but since |n|=1, and phi is the azimuthal angle. But in the x-z plane, phi could vary, but for simplicity, perhaps we can say the direction is along (n_x, 0, n_z), where n_x^2 +n_z^2 =1.

But earlier, I represented the eigenvector as [n_x, (1 -n_z)]^T, normalized. So, if n_x = sin(theta), and n_z = cos(theta), then the vector becomes [sin(theta), 1 - cos(theta)]^T.

But 1 - cos(theta) = 2 sin^2(theta/2), and sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So, substituting:

The vector becomes [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2), 2 sin^2(theta/2) ]^T.

Factoring out 2 sin(theta/2), we get:

2 sin(theta/2) [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

The norm is sqrt( [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)]^2 + [2 sin^2(theta/2)]^2 )

= 2 sin(theta/2) sqrt( cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) )

= 2 sin(theta/2) *1 = 2 sin(theta/2)

So, the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T multiplied by (2 sin(theta/2)) / (2 sin(theta/2)) ) → wait, no.

Wait, actually, the normalized vector is [ sin(theta)/sqrt(2(1-n_z)), (1 -n_z)/sqrt(2(1-n_z)) ].

Substituting n_z = cos(theta), we have:

sin(theta)/sqrt(2(1 - cos(theta))) → sin(theta) / sqrt(4 sin^2(theta/2)) ) → sin(theta)/(2 sin(theta/2)) )

But sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2), so substituting:

(2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) / (2 sin(theta/2)) ) = cos(theta/2)

Similarly, the second component is [1 - cos(theta)] / sqrt(4 sin^2(theta/2)) ) → [2 sin^2(theta/2)]/(2 sin(theta/2))) → sin(theta/2)

So, the normalized eigenvector becomes [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T.

Ah, so that matches option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

But wait, earlier I thought about the phase factor e^{i phi}, but in this approach, phi doesn't come into play. Why?

Because in this approach, I considered the direction in the x-z plane, which for this case, perhaps the angle phi is 0. Alternatively, perhaps the approach I took, considering the operator as a function of n_x and n_z, leads to an eigenvector that doesn't involve phi, because the operator's components don't involve P_y, which is responsible for the phi dependence.

Wait, let me think again. The eigenvector I found doesn't have a phase factor. But in the general case, the spin-up state along an arbitrary direction (theta, phi) includes a phase factor e^{i phi/2}. So, why isn't it present here?

Ah, because in the initial setup, the operator is in the x-z plane, which implies that phi=0. So, the direction is along the x-z plane, which for a spin-1/2 system, the eigenvector would have the form [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T, but if the direction is along the x-z plane, phi=0, so the phase factor becomes 1. So, the eigenvector would be [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but the problem states that the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so phi can be any angle. So, the eigenvector should include the phase factor. However, in the approach I took, I found an eigenvector without the phase factor. That suggests that perhaps the approach I took (using the matrix approach) only captures the magnitude, not the phase.

Hmm, but in the matrix approach, I ended up with [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T as the normalized eigenvector when phi=0. But for arbitrary phi, the eigenvector includes the phase factor e^{i phi} in the second component.

Wait, perhaps the eigenvector can be written as [cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)]^T, and this would satisfy the eigenvalue equation. But according to the options, option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) ), which is different.

Wait, but the normalized eigenvector I derived earlier from the matrix approach doesn't include the phase factor, but the general spin-up state does. So, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but that doesn't include phi. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but with theta being twice the angle.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the matrix approach, and the eigenvector is more accurately described by option B.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about another approach. Let's consider the eigenstates of the operator S·n, where n is in the x-z plane.

In spherical coordinates, the spin-up state along n is given by:

|+> = e^{-i phi/2} [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T

Which simplifies to [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T multiplied by e^{-i phi/2}, but that's a global phase, which doesn't affect the vector's direction.

So, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But none of the options include both theta/2 and phi. Looking at the options again:

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) )

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

So, option C doesn't include the phase factor, but it's the only option that has theta/2. However, the presence of the phase factor e^{i phi} suggests that the correct eigenvector would involve that term, but none of the options except B include it. 

Wait, perhaps the eigenvector is represented in the computational basis without the phase factor, so the correct normalized eigenvector is option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

But that would neglect the phase factor. Alternatively, perhaps the phase factor is incorporated into the operator, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another way to think about this: the eigenvector can be written in terms of the eigenstates of the Pauli matrices. Let me consider the operator P being (n_x P_x +n_z P_z). The eigenvectors would be the same as the eigenstates of S·n, which are the spin-up and spin-down states.

The spin-up state along n is:

|+> = e^{-i phi/2} ( cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) )

Which is equivalent to:

[ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]

But this doesn't match any of the options exactly. So, perhaps the correct option is C, but it's missing the phase factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the eigenvector without the phase factor, as the phase doesn't affect the physical state.

But the options don't have the phase factor except in option B.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the case where phi=0, so the direction is along the x-axis, and the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which is option C.

But the problem states that the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, implying that phi can be any angle, so the phase factor must be included.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me recap.

The correct spin-up state along an arbitrary direction (theta, phi) is:

|+> = e^{-i phi/2} [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T

Which simplifies to [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T multiplied by e^{-i phi/2}, but the global phase doesn't matter. So the normalized eigenvector is:

[ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T

Looking at the options, none of them have e^{i phi} except option B, which has e^{i phi} multiplied by sin(theta). So, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but with theta replaced by theta/2.

Wait, option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) )

If theta is replaced by theta/2, then cos(theta) becomes cos(theta/2), and sin(theta) becomes sin(theta/2), which would match the spin-up state.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option B if theta is interpreted as theta/2, but that's not stated in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the options are miswritten.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the eigenvector without the phase factor, which would make option C the correct choice.

But given that the operator is along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, the eigenvector should include the phase factor. However, none of the options combine theta/2 and phi except option B.

Wait, perhaps the eigenvector in the problem is expressed in terms of the original x, y, z components, not in the direction of n. So, perhaps the eigenvector is written in terms of the spin components along the original axes, not along the direction n.

In that case, the normalized eigenvector would have components involving cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), but no phase factor if the direction is along x (phi=0), but with a phase factor if phi is non-zero.

But the problem states an arbitrary direction, so the phase factor is necessary. 

But looking at the options again, option B has (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) ), which would correspond to a vector in spherical coordinates, but scaled with theta instead of theta/2.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the matrix approach. Let me go back.

The matrix for P is:

P = (ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

We're looking for eigenvectors with eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, the equation is:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Divide both sides by ħ/2: 

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |ψ> = |ψ>

So, [n_z, n_x; n_x, -n_z] |ψ> = |ψ>

The matrix equation becomes:

n_z a +n_x b = a  
n_x a -n_z b = b 

Rearranging the first equation:

(n_z -1) a +n_x b =0 → a = [n_x/(1 -n_z)] b 

Substituting into the second equation:

n_x [n_x/(1 -n_z)] b -n_z b =b 

=> [n_x^2/(1 -n_z) -n_z ] b = b 

Multiply both sides by (1-n_z):

n_x^2 - n_z (1 -n_z) = (1 -n_z) 

But n_x^2 +n_z^2 =1 → n_x^2 =1-n_z^2 

Substituting:

(1-n_z^2) -n_z +n_z^2 = 1 -n_z 

Which simplifies to:

1 -n_z = 1 -n_z 

Which is always true. So, the eigenvectors are determined by a = [n_x/(1 -n_z)] b 

So, the eigenvector can be written as [n_x, 1-n_z]^T, multiplied by a normalization factor.

As earlier, the norm is sqrt( n_x^2 + (1 -n_z)^2 )

But n_x^2 + (1-n_z)^2 = n_x^2 +1 -2n_z +n_z^2 

Since n_x^2 +n_z^2=1,

=1 +1 -2n_z 

=2(1 -n_z )

So, the norm is sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) 

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) , (1 -n_z)/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) ]^T 

Simplify:

= [n_x, (1 -n_z) ]^T / sqrt( 2(1-n_z) )

= [n_x / sqrt(2(1-n_z)), sqrt( (1-n_z)/2 ) ]^T 

But n_z = cos(theta) since n_z is the z-component (if theta is the angle from z-axis). So, 1-n_z = 2 sin^2(theta/2), and n_x = sin(theta) 

Substituting:

n_x / sqrt(2(1-n_z)) = sin(theta) / sqrt(2 * 2 sin^2(theta/2)) )

= sin(theta) / (2 sin(theta/2) )

But sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) → substitution gives:

= [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / (2 sin(theta/2) )

= cos(theta/2)

Similarly, the second component is sqrt( (1-n_z)/2 ) = sqrt( (2 sin^2(theta/2))/2 ) = sin(theta/2)

So, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T 

Which matches option C. 

But wait, earlier I thought that the general spin-up state includes a phase factor e^{i phi}. Why isn't that appearing here?

Ah, because in this approach, I've assumed that the direction is along the x-z plane, but the eigenvector calculation didn't take into account the azimuthal angle phi. So, perhaps I've considered only the case where phi=0, leading to the eigenvector without the phase factor.

But the problem states that the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, implying that phi can vary. So, the correct eigenvector should account for phi, which isn't captured by this approach.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in not considering the full spherical coordinate system. The earlier approach using the matrix method only gives the eigenvector in terms of n_x and n_z, which are related to theta, but not phi.

Wait, perhaps the eigenvector is indeed [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T, but none of the options directly include this. The closest option is B, which has ( cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) ), but with theta instead of theta/2.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but only when phi=0. But the problem states the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so the answer must include phi.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option B includes e^{i phi}, which suggests that it's considering the phase factor. However, it uses theta instead of theta/2. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different parameterization.

Another angle to approach: the eigenvector can be written as a linear combination of the eigenstates of S_x, S_y, and S_z. But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the eigenstates of the operator P.

Wait, perhaps the eigenvector can be written as [ e^{i phi/2} cos(theta/2), e^{-i phi/2} sin(theta/2) ]^T, but that would require checking.

Alternatively, perhaps I should take a concrete example. Let's say the direction is along the x-axis. Then theta=90 degrees (pi/2 radians), phi=0.

In this case, the normalized eigenvector should be [0, 1]^T, because along x, the spin-up state is |+x> = (|+> + |-> ) / sqrt(2) = (1,1)^T / sqrt(2), but wait, no, wait. Wait, for spin-1/2, the eigenstates of S_x are (1,0) and (0,1) for eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The eigenstates of S_x are superpositions of the computational basis states. Because S_x is represented by (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], so its eigenstates are (1,1)/sqrt(2) and (1,-1)/sqrt(2), which correspond to eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively.

So, for direction along x-axis, the eigenvector is (1,1)/sqrt(2), which in our earlier approach should correspond to theta=90 degrees (pi/2), phi=0.

Using option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

theta = pi/2 → theta/2=pi/4 → cos(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2 → [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2]

Which matches the eigenvector (1,1)/sqrt(2) when normalized. So in this case, option C gives the correct eigenvector.

Another example: direction along z-axis (theta=0, phi=0). The spin-up state is (1,0)^T. Using option C: cos(0)=1, sin(0)=0 → (1,0), which is correct.

Another example: direction at 60 degrees from z, theta=60 degrees (pi/3), phi=0.

Eigenvector would be cos(30)=sqrt(3)/2, sin(30)=1/2 → (sqrt(3)/2, 1/2). Which is correct for the spin-up state.

But wait, according to the general spin-up state, the eigenvector should be [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T. So, in this case, phi=0, so it's (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which matches option C.

So, it seems that for any direction in the x-z plane with phi=0, option C gives the correct eigenvector. But what if phi is not zero? 

Let's take phi = 90 degrees (pi/2), theta=90 degrees (pi/2). The direction is along the x-axis, but phi=pi/2 implies the direction is along the positive y-axis, but wait, no. Wait, in the x-z plane, phi=0 is along the x-axis, phi=pi/2 would be along the z-axis? No, wait, no, in the x-z plane, phi is 0 along the x-axis, phi=pi along the negative x-axis. Wait, the x-z plane has phi=0, pi, etc., but in that case, the direction is along the x-axis for phi=0, and negative x-axis for phi=pi. So, when theta=90 degrees and phi=pi/2, that would be a direction in the y-z plane, which is outside the x-z plane. So, perhaps in the x-z plane, phi can only be 0 and pi, but that's not the case because the direction can be any angle around the z-axis, but constrained to the x-z plane, which would imply that phi can vary, but the direction remains in x-z.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me make it clear: the direction vector is in the x-z plane, so any direction can be represented with phi=0 and varying theta, but that's not correct because phi is the angle around the z-axis. So, for any direction in the x-z plane, phi can be any value, but the y-component remains zero.

Wait, but in spherical coordinates, the direction in the x-z plane would have phi=0 or phi=pi, but if the problem allows any direction in the x-z plane, then phi can be any value because it's a full circle around the z-axis, but only in the x-z plane.

Wait, perhaps the way I've derived the eigenvector using the matrix approach doesn't take into account the phi dependence because the operator's components (P_x and P_z) don't involve P_y, which is responsible for phi dependence. So, the eigenvector derived using the matrix approach doesn't include the phase factor, leading to option C being the correct answer regardless of phi.

But earlier, the spin-up state does include the phase factor. So, why is there a discrepancy?

Ah! Wait a minute. The operator in this problem is given as P = P_x + P_y + P_z, but no, wait, the operator is along the arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So, the operator is P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z, as I correctly wrote earlier. Since the operator doesn't involve P_y, the eigenvector calculation doesn't involve phi. So, the eigenvector I derived using the matrix approach is correct in the context of the given operator, which doesn't include P_y.

Wait, but in reality, the spin operator S·n should involve all three components, including S_y. But in this problem, the operator given is in the x-z plane, so n_y=0, and thus the operator is S·n = n_x S_x + n_z S_z, which doesn't involve S_y. So, the eigenvectors won't have the same form as the general spin-up state, since they're determined by a combination of S_x and S_z, not involving S_y.

That means the eigenvectors derived from this operator (only in x-z plane) won't carry the phase factor e^{i phi} because the operator doesn't have any S_y component. So, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, which is option C.

So, the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given as a combination of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, where $P_x$ and $P_z$ are explicitly provided, and $P_y$ is not involved since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. The task is to determine the correct normalized eigenvector from the given options.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Operator Structure**:  
   The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed as $\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $n_x$ and $n_z$ are the direction cosines of $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, satisfying $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the operator matrix becomes:
   \[
   P = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalue Equation**:  
   The eigenvalue equation is:
   \[
   P |\psi\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |\psi\rangle,
   \]
   leading to the matrix equation:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   Solving this system, the eigenvector components satisfy $a = \frac{n_x}{1 - n_z} b$. Normalizing the eigenvector, the normalized form becomes:
   \[
   |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix},
   \]
   where $\theta$ is the polar angle of $\vec{n}$ from the z-axis.

3. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect since eigenvectors are dimensionless.  
   - **Option B**: Contains $(\cos(\theta), e^{i\phi}\sin(\theta))$, which does not match the derived eigenvector form and incorrectly uses $\theta$ instead of $\theta/2$.  
   - **Option C**: Matches the derived normalized eigenvector $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))^T$, which is consistent with the spin-up state along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane.  
   - **Option D**: Includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect, and does not match the derived eigenvector form.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The derived normalized eigenvector $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))^T$ corresponds to **Option C**, which is consistent with the eigenvalue equation and the structure of the operator $\vec{P}$.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
