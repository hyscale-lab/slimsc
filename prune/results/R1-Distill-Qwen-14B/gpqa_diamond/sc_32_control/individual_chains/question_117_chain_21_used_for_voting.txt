Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism—that's when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? They have chiral centers, which means they can't be superimposed on their mirror images. Chirality usually requires a carbon atom with four different substituents.

The question gives me four compounds, and I need to determine which show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each combining three of the four compounds. Let me go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected at positions 1 and 1'. The substituents are nitro groups at 6 and 6' positions and carboxylate groups at 2 and 2'. Wait, the structure is a biphenyl with substituents. Do the substituents create any stereogenic centers? Well, the central carbon where the rings are connected is a single bond, so the biphenyl can rotate, but wait, sometimes in biphenyls, especially with bulky substituents, the rings can be in different positions like trans or cis. But that's more about geometric isomerism, not optical. Oh wait, but if the substituents on each ring are in positions that create a chiral center, then maybe. Let me think about the substituents. Each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group. Wait, no, each ring has two substituents? Or is each substituent on each ring? So on each benzene ring, there's a nitro and a carboxylate group. Wait, the positions are 2 and 2'—so each ring has substituents at 2 and 6? Or maybe each substituent is on each ring. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each benzene ring has substituents at 2 and 6, making each ring have two substituents. But wait, are any of the carbons in this structure chiral? I don't think so. The central connecting carbon isn't a chiral center because it's bonded to two phenyl groups and two other substituents—like the nitro and carboxylate groups. Wait, no, the central carbon is actually part of the biphenyl structure. Oh wait, biphenyls are two benzene rings connected by a single bond. So each benzene ring is attached to the central carbon. So the substituents on each ring are at positions 6 and 2. Let's imagine the central carbon is attached to two phenyl groups and perhaps other substituents. Wait, no, the substituents would be on the phenyl rings, not the central carbon. So the central carbon is probably connected to two phenyl groups. Wait, no, the biphenyl is 1,1'-, so each benzene ring is attached to the central carbon. So the central carbon is a CH2 group? No, wait, wait, a biphenyl is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. So the 1,1' refers to the positions where the two benzene rings are connected. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6 positions. Are any of the substituents making a chiral center? Let me think: The substituents are nitro at 6 and 6', and carboxylate at 2 and 2'. Wait, the substituents are on the benzene rings. So the central carbon is part of a single bond, and each ring is connected at that position. So the two rings are connected via a single bond, meaning the arrangement can lead to cis or trans isomerism. Wait, but that's geometric isomerism, not optical. But wait, if the substituents on each ring are identical and arranged symmetrically, then maybe the molecule doesn't have a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe each substituent is on the same side, leading to a planar structure. Hmm, I'm not sure. I think this compound might not exhibit optical isomerism because perhaps the substituents are not on chiral centers. Or maybe it does because the biphenyl could have a plane of symmetry, making it meso. Wait, no, if the substituents are arranged in a way that each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate, perhaps each substituent is in a position that causes a chiral center elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps there are no chiral centers here. I'm a bit stuck on this. Maybe I should move on and come back.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO something? Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3CH(OH)COOH, then the methyl ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, the molecule is (R)- or (S)-configured? Wait, looking at the carbon with the hydroxyl group. Let's see: the central carbon (the second carbon) has the groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH3? No, wait, the structure is perhaps CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, but that's three substituents. Wait, no, the formula is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-; 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure would be:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C(OH)-CH3

Wait, the carbon chain is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central CH(OH) is connected to: two CH3 groups, a hydroxyl, and a carbonyl group (which is connected to OCH3). Wait, no, wait. The structure is:

CH3
|
C(OH)
|
CH2-COOCH3

No, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me try again. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So it's:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3?

Wait, no. Wait, the ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH2-OH-CH2-CO-OCH3. Now, I'm looking at the second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group). It's connected to:

- One OH group,
- Two CH2 groups, but wait, each CH2 would be connected to what? Let me draw the structure:

The molecule is CH2(OH)-CH2-CO-OCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) has four substituents: one OH, two CH2 groups (left and right?), and a carbonyl group. Wait, no, the central carbon is actually the second carbon. So the substituents are:

- One OH,
- One CH2CH2COOCH3? Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the actual structure. The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which can be written as CH3-C(O)-OCH2CH(OH)CH3? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's O

Wait, maybe the structure is: 

The ester is CH3-O-CO-CH(CH2OH)-something. No, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's something like:

CH3
|
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH(OH)CH3

No, perhaps the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- Two CH3 groups,
- One OH,
- One COOCH3 group.

Wait, that can't be right because that would make four substituents. Let me see: the carbon has four groups—so:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (as a substituent on the third carbon),
- and another CH3? Or perhaps it's a different arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. No, that's four carbons. Wait, the formula is C4H6O3. Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which would be:

The propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, so CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, that's three carbons in the chain (propanoate is three carbons), so the chain is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon (CH2) is between the hydroxyl and the rest. Wait, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon, which is CH2. So the substituents on the second carbon are:

- Two CH2 groups (one leading to OH, the other leading to COOCH3),
- And the other two substituents are hydrogens?

Wait, but wait: the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3? No, because that would make the second carbon attached to OH, CH3, COOCH3, and another CH. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The carbon chain is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the second carbon has:

- One CH3,
- One OH,
- One COOCH3,
- And one CH group (from the adjacent carbon? Wait, no, in that case, each carbon is connected in a chain. So the second carbon is connected to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon),
- and another CH (from the third carbon? No, that doesn't make sense.)

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH3
|
C(OH)
|
CH2COOCH3

So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- and another H? No, that can't be because the central carbon would have four bonds.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the right),
- and another H? No, wait, that would be three substituents. So this can't be right. I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps I can think about whether there's a chiral center. If the second carbon has four different groups attached, then it's a chiral center. Let's imagine:

Carbon 2: attached to:

1. CH3 (from carbon 1),
2. OH,
3. COOCH3 (from carbon 3),
4. Another CH2 group? Or perhaps it's connected to a carbonyl. Wait, I'm getting too confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the carbon with the hydroxyl has four different substituents. If that's the case, then it would have a chiral center and exhibit optical isomerism.

So for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, if the hydroxyl is on a carbon that's connected to four different groups, then it's chiral, leading to optical isomers. If not, then no.

Wait, let's imagine the structure correctly. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. So the ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH3-O-CO-O-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? No, perhaps not. Alternatively, the structure is:

The molecule is CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, that doesn't fit the name. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, which would have the structure:

CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, so the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH (from the adjacent carbon). Wait, but that would make four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a CH2 group? Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting this right, but if the carbon with OH has four distinct groups, then it's chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The molecule is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the second carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH (from where?).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me count the substituents on the OH-bearing carbon. If it's:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH2 group? Or perhaps it's connected to another carbon that's part of the same chain. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the OH is on a carbon that's connected to three different groups. Wait, no, for a chiral center, it needs four different substituents.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the number of substituents. For methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (from one side),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the other side),
- and another CH3 from the same chain? Because propanoate has three carbons. So perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In that case, the central CH(OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (on one side),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (on the other side),
- and another CH (from the adjacent COOCH3 group? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, no, the central carbon is the second in the chain:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: COOCH3

So carbon 2 (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (CH3),
- OH,
- Carbon 3 (COOCH3),
- and another hydrogen or something else?

Wait, carbon 2 would have four bonds: one to carbon 1 (CH3), one to OH, one to carbon 3 (COOCH3), and one more bond. But wait, in this case, carbon 2 is bonded to three other carbons. Wait, no, carbon 2 is a CH(OH), so it's bonded to:

- CH3 (carbon 1),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (carbon 3),
- and another hydrogen? Then it's CH(OH)(H)CH2COOCH3? No, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that carbon 2 has four different groups.

Wait, if the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (CH(OH)) has substituents:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH (from the adjacent COOCH3? No, perhaps it's connected to another CH group).

Wait, I think I'm stuck on this, but let's proceed. If the hydroxyl is on a carbon that has four different groups, then it's a chiral center, and the molecule will exhibit optical isomerism. So I'll tentatively say that compound 2 does show optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. Structure is (Ph)2CO. Two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl group. The carbonyl is C=O. The central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and an oxygen. So the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The carbon in the carbonyl is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's not a chiral center because it's not tetrahedral. So benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers; thus, it cannot exhibit optical isomerism. So compound 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is (Z)-butenedioic acid: HO2CCH=CHCO2H. The dimethyl ester would be CH2=CHCOOCH3 and another CH2=CHCOOCH3? Wait, no, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no—fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. So when esterified with methanol, it becomes CH2=CHCOOCH3 and another CH2=CHCOOCH3? Wait, no, the structure is actually that of a diester. So dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=CHCOOCH3 attached to another CH2=CHCOOCH3 via a central carbon? No, wait, wait. Fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2=CH-C-O-OCH3

Wait, perhaps it's more accurately represented as:

CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 and CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 connected in a way. Wait, no, the correct structure is that fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's succinic acid. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So the structure is two carboxylic acid groups connected by a double bond: HO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–COOH is maleic acid, but wait, no, fumaric acid is HO₂C–CH=CH–COOH. The dimethyl ester would replace the hydroxyls with OCH3 groups, so it would be O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. So the structure is (OCH3)₂C–CH=CH–C(O₂)₂OCH3? No, wait, the correct structure is:

The diester of fumaric acid is O

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that dimethyl fumarate has two ester groups and a double bond. The structure is: CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. So it's a central CH2 group with a double bond to another CH group, each of which is attached to two COOCH3 groups. So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2=CH
|
COOCH3

Wait, no. Fumarate is a trans diacid, so the dimethyl ester would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

So the structure is O

But regardless, the key point is whether there's a possibility of stereoisomerism. Fumarate is a trans diacid, but as a diester (dimethyl fumarate), it has a double bond. However, the question is about optical isomerism, not geometric. So, does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers?

Looking at the structure, the central carbon is part of a double bond (CH=CH), so each of those carbons is double-bonded. So the carbons in the double bond (C=C) are each bonded to two substituents.

Wait, the dimethyl fumarate structure is (Z) or (E) isomer? Wait, no, in this case, the double bond is between the two carbonyl groups. Hmm.

Wait, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. Fumaric acid is HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, fumaric acid is HO₂C-CH=CH-COOH. So the di-ester would be OCH3 on each of the carboxylic acids. So the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3.

Wait, but in this structure, each of the inner carbons (the ones in the middle, the C=C) has two COOCH3 groups. So each of those carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups, a double bond, and perhaps a hydrogen. Wait, no, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH₂=CH-C
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the two carbonyl groups are on either end of the double bond. So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
COOCH3

No, that's not right. Wait, no, the correct structure is HO₂C-CH=CH-COOH, so the ester would be OCH3 groups. So:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH₂=CH
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (COOCH3)₂C=CH₂? No, that's not correct. Alternatively, the structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. Either way, the key is to look for chiral centers. Are any of the carbons in dimethyl fumarate a chiral center?

Looking at the structure, the central carbons are in a double bond, so they are sp² hybridized and can't be chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but wait! When the double bond is present, can it lead to cis or trans isomerism? Yes, but that's geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism. So the question is about optical isomerism, which requires chiral centers. So, if dimethyl fumarate doesn't have chiral centers, then it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait, I thought that fumarate is the trans isomer, and maleate is the cis. But regardless, without a chiral center, it can't have optical isomerism.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think: dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. Its structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C=O(OCH3)? No, that's not correct. Wait, the correct structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C=O(OCH3). So each CH is connected to two COOCH3 groups. So each of these CH groups is bonded to two COOCH3 groups and a double bond. So each of these CH groups is bonded to:

- Two COOCH3 groups,
- One double bond (so it's sp² hybridized),
- And another substituent, perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, no, if the structure is CH₂=CH, then the central carbons are each bonded to two COOCH3 groups and a double bond. So each central carbon would have three substituents: two COOCH3 and the double bond. But that leaves one more bond, which would be a hydrogen. So each central carbon is bonded to two COOCH3, a hydrogen, and the double bond. So each central carbon would have the groups: COOCH3, COOCH3, H, and double bond. Wait, but that's two identical substituents (two COOCH3 groups), so each central carbon has three substituents: two COOCH3 and a hydrogen. But wait, for a chiral center, you need four distinct substituents. So in this case, because two substituents are the same (both COOCH3), the central carbon isn't a chiral center. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, meaning it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another point. Wait, perhaps the ester groups are on different sides of the double bond. For example, in the (E) isomer, the substituents are opposite each other, but does that create any chiral centers? No, because the substituents on each carbon are two COOCH3 groups and a hydrogen, which isn't four different groups.

So, to recap:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: I'm not sure yet. Maybe it doesn't have a chiral center.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: If the OH is on a carbon with four distinct groups, it's chiral. I'm leaning towards yes.

3. Benzophenone: No chiral centers. So no optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: No chiral centers. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm confused about compound 4. Wait, another thought: dimethyl fumarate has a central double bond (CH=CH), each CH connected to two COOCH3 groups. So each of those CH groups is bonded to two identical substituents (two COOCH3 groups), a hydrogen, and the double bond. So each has three substituents, but no chiral center because two substituents are the same. Thus, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait—another possibility: perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it meso. For example, if the two substituents on each side are mirror images, leading the molecule to have an internal plane of symmetry. But in this case, with two COOCH3 groups on each CH, it's symmetric. So no, it wouldn't have a chiral center.

So, looking back: which options have chiral centers.

Looking at the options:

Option A says 1,2,4.

Option B says 3 and 4. But 3 and 4 don't have optical isomerism, so B is wrong.

Option C: 2 and 3. 3 doesn't have it, so C is wrong.

Option D: 1 and 2.

So, whether 1 and 2 have optical isomerism.

Let me re-examine compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Structure: biphenyl (two benzene rings connected by a single bond), with nitro groups at 6 and 6' positions, and carboxylate groups at 2 and 2' positions.

So each benzene ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. The central bond is between two benzene rings (1 and 1').

Now, in biphenyl structures, the substituents can affect whether the molecule has a chiral center. Wait, but the biphenyl itself doesn't have a carbon that's bonded to four different groups. The central bond is a single bond, so the biphenyl can rotate. However, substituents on each ring can lead to a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, but each ring has substituents at 2 and 6 positions. So each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group. Looking at the structure, each ring has two substituents. But are any of the carbons in the rings chiral centers? No, because the substituents are on the aromatic rings, which are part of a conjugated system, so the carbons in the rings are sp² hybridized and can't be chiral centers.

Wait, but what about the central connecting point. The central carbon is where the two benzene rings are connected. So, in this case, the central carbon is bonded to two benzene rings and perhaps two other groups. Wait, no, in biphenyl, the central position is a single bond between two benzene rings. So the structure is benzene-Ph-benzene, connected at the 1 and 1' positions. Thus, the central carbon is part of the single bond, but it's a carbon that's bonded to two phenyl groups, and perhaps other substituents?

Wait, no. The central carbon is part of the benzene rings. Each benzene ring has six carbons. The connecting point is at the 1 position of each ring. So each ring has a carbon at position 1 connected to the other ring. So the central carbon is a single carbon, perhaps connected to two benzene rings. Wait, no, each benzene ring has six carbons, so the central bond is between C-1 of each ring. Thus, the structure is two benzene rings connected by a single bond between their C-1 positions.

In this structure, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. So each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate group at position 2. So the substituents on each ring are at positions 2 and 6, which are para to each other.

Wait, if both nitro groups are at 6 and 6' of their respective rings, and the carboxylate groups are at 2 and 2', then the substituents are arranged symmetrically on each ring.

But wait, in such a case, perhaps the entire molecule is symmetrical, leading to no chiral centers. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it meso.

But wait, in the case of 6,6' and 2,2' substituents, the molecule would have a center of symmetry. So, for example, the molecule would be symmetrical along the central bond. Thus, it's a meso compound and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but what if the substituents are not symmetrical? For example, if the substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring are different, but in this case, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate. So perhaps the arrangement leads to the molecule being achiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents cause the molecule to have a chiral center elsewhere, but I don't think so in this case.

So, compound 1: no optical isomerism.

Compound 2: if the OH-bearing carbon has four different groups, then it's chiral. Based on the structure I was trying to imagine, I think it does. So compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

So, among the four compounds, only compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says 1,2,4. But I thought 1 and 4 don't. Option D says 1 and 2, but 1 doesn't. So the only one that does is 2. But looking at the options, none have only 2. Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me reevaluate dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, another thought: dimethyl fumarate could have a chiral center if the ester groups are on the same or opposite sides. Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer of the diacid. The dimethyl ester would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. But that doesn't create a chiral center because the central carbons are part of a double bond and not chiral centers.

Wait, but maybe I'm wrong about that. Another possibility: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a bridge structure. Wait, no, it's a simple diester with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, after reevaluating, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But looking back at the options, none of them have only 2. Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

Hmm, but the correct answer would only include compound 2. But that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again about dimethyl fumarate.

Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester, so the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH₂-CH₂
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that's not correct. Wait, fumarate is the trans-diesters, so the structure is O

Wait, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. So each CH is connected to two COOCH3 groups and a hydrogen. Each CH has substituents: COOCH3, COOCH3, H, and the double bond. So each CH would have two identical groups (COOCH3), so no chiral centers. Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, perhaps only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But in the options, the only option that includes 2 is A and D. Option A includes 1,2,4. Option D includes 1 and 2.

But I thought 1 doesn't. So perhaps I was wrong about compound 1.

Let me revisit compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, each benzene ring has substituents at 2 and 6 positions. The substituents on each ring are a nitro group and a carboxylate group.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate. Suppose on one ring, the nitro is at 6 and the carboxylate at 2. On the other ring, the nitro is at 6' and the carboxylate at 2'. So the substituents are arranged symmetrically.

Now, could this arrangement lead to a chiral center in the molecule? I don't think so, because the molecule is symmetrical. But perhaps when the substituents are in certain positions, the molecule becomes chiral.

Wait, another possibility: the central bond is a single bond, so the two rings can rotate. If the substituents are arranged such that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it could have a chiral center.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents on each ring are in symmetrical positions (2 and 6). So the entire molecule is symmetrical, making it a meso compound, thus not chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule asymmetrical, leading to a chiral center.

Wait, suppose the substituents are on the same side of each ring. Then, the molecule might not be symmetrical. But in that case, each ring's substituents would be in positions that could lead to a chiral center.

Wait, but I'm not seeing any carbon in the structure that has four different substituents. The substituents are on aromatic rings, which are sp² hybridized, so the carbons in the rings aren't chiral centers.

Wait, perhaps the central bond is a single bond, but the molecule has a chiral center elsewhere. For example, perhaps the substituents on the rings cause the entire molecule to have a chiral center.

But I'm struggling to see how, because the substituents are on the rings, which are planar.

So, I think compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Therefore, the only compound showing optical isomerism is compound 2. But none of the options include only compound 2.

Wait, looking back at the options:

A)1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: which of these compounds have any chiral centers.

1. No chiral center.

2. Yes, a chiral center.

3. No.

4. No.

So, only compound 2 has a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

But the options don't have an option that includes just 2. So perhaps the question allows for a compound that can have optical isomerism, perhaps through another means.

Wait, another thought: maybe the ester group in compound 2 is a chiral center. Let's see.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The central carbon (the CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH (from the adjacent carbon? Or perhaps a hydrogen?).

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3
|
C(OH)
|
CH2-COOCH3

In that case, the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, that would make four different substituents: CH3, OH, CH2COOCH3, and H. So that's a chiral center, making the molecule exhibit optical isomerism.

So, compound 2 does have optical isomerism.

Now, looking at the options again:

Which option includes only compound 2? But the options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2.

Hmm, none of the options has only 2. So perhaps I missed another compound.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 4. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate: structure is (E)-CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂.

The two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is trans.

Now, if the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides, could that create a chiral center elsewhere? Wait, no, because the central carbons are part of a double bond, so they aren't chiral centers.

Wait, unless the molecule has some other chiral centers. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't symmetrical, leading to optical isomerism. But I don't think so.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ester groups are arranged in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry or not.

Wait, if the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side (cis), then the molecule would be maleic acid dimethyl ester, which is the cis isomer. If they're on opposite sides (trans), it's fumaric acid dimethyl ester.

But regardless, neither isomer has a chiral center because the central carbons are part of a double bond and thus can't be chiral.

So, compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, then what about the other compounds.

Let me check the options again. Only compound 2 has a chiral center, but the options don't have an option with just 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate compound 4. Another possibility: dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. Let me think about its structure.

The structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. So the four substituents on the central carbons are:

Each CH in the double bond is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group,
- The double bond,
- And two H's.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

If the structure is (COOCH3)₂C=CH₂, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. So each CH in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups and one H. So each CH has substituents: COOCH3, COOCH3, H, and the double bond.

So each of the CH's has two identical substituents (COOCH3), so no chiral centers.

Thus, compound 4 doesn't have a chiral center and no optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 has a chiral center and shows optical isomerism. But the options don't have a choice that includes just 2. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each benzene ring has nitro and carboxylate groups at 6 and 2 positions.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, leading to a chiral center in the molecule.

But how? The central bond is a single bond between the two benzene rings. The substituents are on the rings, so any carbon in the rings is sp² hybridized and can't be a chiral center.

Unless, perhaps, there are substituents on the central carbon that make it a chiral center. But I don't think so because the central bond is between two benzene rings, which are planar.

Wait, perhaps the molecule's substituents lead to a chiral center elsewhere. For example, if the arrangement of substituents on the biphenyl leads to a chiral center in the molecule, but I can't see how because the central carbon is part of the rings and has two benzene substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement of substituents on the rings leads to a chiral center in the molecule. But I don't see how, because the substituents are on the aromatic rings, which are planar and not chiral.

Thus, I think compound 1 doesn't have a chiral center and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 has a chiral center, meaning only it shows optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. So perhaps I'm missing another compound.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Another approach: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center if the ester groups are on the same side. Wait, but if they are, then it's the cis isomer (maleate), which doesn't have a chiral center either.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond creates some sort of stereogenic center, but that's not possible because the central carbons are sp² hybridized.

Thus, I think compound 4 doesn't have a chiral center.

So, the only compound that shows optical isomerism is compound 2.

But the options don't have an option that includes only 2. So perhaps the only correct answer is option A) 1,2,4, but I don't think 1 and 4 have optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and should consider that compound 4 does have a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 4. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. Let's imagine the structure:

COOCH3
|
CH₂=CH
|
COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂.

So each CH in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. So each CH has substituents: COOCH3, COOCH3, H, and the double bond. So each CH has two identical substituents, making them not chiral centers.

Thus, compound 4 doesn't have any chiral centers.

So, returning to the options, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is compound 2. But none of the options have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 1.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's think about the other compounds.

Option D is 1 and 2. So, if I'm wrong about compound 1 and it actually has a chiral center, then option D would be correct.

But why would compound 1 have a chiral center?

Ah! Wait a minute. Perhaps the central bond in the biphenyl structure is flexible, but the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, leading to a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical.

Wait, but in compound 1, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So if both rings are the same, then the molecule is symmetrical along the central bond, meaning it's a meso compound and not chiral. But if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, perhaps the molecule becomes chiral.

Wait, no, because the substituents are on each ring, making the molecule symmetrical. So it's a meso compound.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to make a decision.

Based on my analysis, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. However, since none of the options match, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate: (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. The structure is (E)-CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. Each CH in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups, a hydrogen, and the double bond. So each CH has two identical substituents, meaning no chiral center.

So, I'm confident that compound 2 is the only one showing optical isomerism, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4. But I don't think 1 and 4 have optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 1. Let me consider the possibility that compound 1 has a chiral center.

Wait, another approach: the molecule could have a chiral center if the two substituents on each ring are not symmetrical. For example, if the substituents on the two rings are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

But in this case, each ring has the same substituents (nitro and carboxylate at 6 and 2), so the molecule is symmetrical, making it a meso compound. So, no optical isomerism.

Thus, I'm back to my initial conclusion that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But the options don't include that. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate compound 4. Wait, another thought: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center because the central carbon is connected to different groups.

Wait, no, the central carbons are in a double bond, so they're sp² hybridized and can't be chiral centers.

So, after all this, I think the correct answer is only compound 2, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 4. Let me think about the possibility that dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. For that to happen, one of the carbons in the molecule must have four different substituents.

Wait, in the structure of dimethyl fumarate, each CH in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups, a hydrogen, and the double bond. So, substituents are:

- COOCH3,
- COOCH3,
- H,
- (double bond, which is considered as a substituent).

But since two substituents are the same, it doesn't have four different groups.

Thus, no chiral center.

So, I'm confident that only compound 2 has a chiral center. But since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the other compounds again.

Wait, perhaps compound 1 has a chiral center because the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and two other different groups. Let me imagine the structure again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure is two benzene rings connected at their 1 positions, with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. Each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group.

But the central carbon (the one connected to both rings) is bonded to two phenyl groups and perhaps other substituents. Wait, no, the central carbon is part of the benzene rings, so it's not a separate carbon. Thus, it's not a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring cause the molecule to have a chiral center elsewhere. But I don't see any other carbon that could have four different substituents.

So, I think compound 1 doesn't have a chiral center.

Thus, I'm stuck. Based on the analysis, only compound 2 has a chiral center and exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of compound 2. Let me think again.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. The central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH (from the adjacent carbon? Or perhaps a hydrogen).

Wait, if the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central CH(OH) is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH (from the adjacent COOCH3 group? Or perhaps a hydrogen).

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the central carbon has four different substituents:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and a hydrogen (H).

If that's the case, then yes, it's a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)-CH2-COOCH3, making the central carbon (C(OH)) connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- and another H.

In that case, four different substituents, so a chiral center exists.

Thus, compound 2 has a chiral center and exhibits optical isomerism.

So, among the options, the correct answer would include only 2, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 1,2,4. But I don't think 1 and 4 have optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I should look for other possibilities. For example, perhaps compound 4 has a chiral center.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center due to the arrangement of the ester groups. But I can't see how because the central carbons are part of a double bond.

I'm running out of time, so I'll make a decision based on the analysis.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of a chiral center, which requires a carbon atom bonded to four different substituents. Optical isomerism arises when such chiral centers exist, leading to non-superimposable mirror images.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected at the 1 and 1' positions, with nitro groups at 6 and 6' and carboxylate groups at 2 and 2'. The molecule is symmetrical due to the identical substituents on both rings, making it a meso compound. Since there are no chiral centers, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (CH(OH)) is connected to four different substituents: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂CO, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl group. The central carbon in the carbonyl is double-bonded to oxygen and cannot be a chiral center. Thus, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   The structure of dimethyl fumarate is (COOCH₃)₂C=CH₂, with a double bond between the two carbons. The carbons in the double bond are sp² hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. Additionally, the molecule is planar and symmetric, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Among the four compounds, only **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Compound 2)** has a chiral center and exhibits optical isomerism. None of the other compounds (1, 3, or 4) have chiral centers and thus do not exhibit optical isomerism. However, none of the provided options correctly include only Compound 2. Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is **Option A (1, 2, 4)**, though it is not entirely accurate.
