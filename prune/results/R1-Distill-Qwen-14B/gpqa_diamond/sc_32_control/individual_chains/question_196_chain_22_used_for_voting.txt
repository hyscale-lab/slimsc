Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed, v_max. The options are given, so maybe after some analysis, I can pick the right one.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is related to the amplitude and the spring constant. The formula I think is v_max = (kA/m)^0.5 * A, but wait, no, that's not quite right. Oh wait, the angular frequency ω is sqrt(k/m), so the maximum speed should be ω times A. So v_max = sqrt(k/m) * A. Which is (k A^2/m)^0.5. So that's option C. But wait, no, this is a relativistic oscillator, so things are different.

Relativistic effects come into play when velocities are significant compared to the speed of light. So the equations must involve the Lorentz factor, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Hmm.

In the relativistic case, the potential energy isn't just (1/2)k x². Oh right, for a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential is different. Wait, but the question says it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -k x. So perhaps the potential is still (1/2)k x², but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

Wait, maybe the total energy is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential. For a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is conserved, so at the maximum displacement (x = A), the kinetic energy is zero, and the potential is (1/2)k A². At the equilibrium point, the potential is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum.

But wait, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c². So at the equilibrium position, all the potential energy is converted into kinetic. So, the total energy E is (1/2)k A² = (gamma - 1) m c².

Wait, that makes sense. But let me write that equation down: (1/2) k A² = (γ - 1) m c².

I need to find v_max, which is the speed when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic. So the kinetic energy is (γ - 1) m c², and that's equal to (1/2) k A².

Hmm, solving for gamma: (1/2) k A² = (γ - 1) m c² → γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, but gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So we can write:

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me call that term k A²/(2 m c²) as Q for simplicity. So Q = k A²/(2 m c²). Then the equation becomes:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + Q.

Let me square both sides to get rid of the square root.

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + Q)^2 → 1/(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + 2Q + Q².

Wait, but Q is (k A²)/(2 m c²). I'm not sure if Q is small or not. For non-relativistic cases, Q would be small because v is much less than c, but here we're considering relativistic cases, so maybe Q is not that negligible.

But let's proceed. Let me rearrange the equation:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + Q)^2 → 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + Q)^2.

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + Q)^2 → v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + Q)^2] → v = c * sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + Q)^2}).

Hmm, that looks a bit messy. Let me compute [1/(1 + Q)^2] as 1/( (1 + Q )^2 ). So the expression becomes:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + Q)^2 )

Which can be written as c * sqrt( ( (1 + Q)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + Q)^2 ) )

Simplify numerator: (1 + 2Q + Q^2) -1 = 2Q + Q^2.

So:

v_max = c * sqrt( (2Q + Q^2) ) / (1 + Q )

Factor out Q from numerator: Q(2 + Q) / (1 + Q)^2.

Hmm, but perhaps a better approach is to express it differently.

Alternatively, let's compute 1 - [1/(1 + Q)^2} ].

Let me compute that:

1 - 1/(1 + Q)^2 = [ (1 + Q)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + Q)^2.

Which is [1 + 2Q + Q² - 1 ] / (1 + Q)^2 → (2Q + Q²) / (1 + Q)^2.

So v²/c² = (2Q + Q²)/(1 + Q)^2.

So sqrt of that is sqrt( (2Q + Q²) ) / (1 + Q).

Hmm, but this expression might not be the most useful. Let's think about the options given.

Looking at the options, option B is v_max= c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2 m c² )) ) )

Wait, that doesn't look right. Let me check each option.

Option A: v_max= c√[1 + 1/(1−kA²/(2m))² ]

Option B: v_max= c√[1+ 1/(1−kA²/(2 m c² )) ]

Option C: v_max= sqrt( kA²/m ), which is the classical non-relativistic case.

Option D: v_max= c√[ 1−1/(1 +kA²/(2 m c² ))² ]

Wait, my expression is v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + Q )² ), where Q is kA²/(2 m c²).

So, 1/(1+Q ) squared is 1/(1 + Q)^2.

So my expression is c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + Q)^2 ] )

Which can be written as c * sqrt( ( (1 + Q)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + Q )^2 )

Which is same as c * sqrt( ( (1 + 2Q + Q^2 -1 )) / (1 + Q )^2 )

That's c * sqrt( (2Q + Q^2) ) / (1 + Q )

Hmm, but perhaps a better way is to consider the reciprocal.

Wait, maybe I should try to express it as 1/(gamma) terms.

Wait, but earlier I had gamma = 1 + Q, where Q = k A^2/(2 m c^2 )

So gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So, beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2 )

Wait, because gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2 ), so 1/gamma^2 = 1 - beta² → beta² = 1 - 1/gamma^2.

So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2 )

So, gamma is 1 + Q, so:

beta = sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + Q )^2 )

Which is same as I had earlier.

Wait, but the options don't seem to directly match this. Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + Q )².

Wait, 1/(1 + Q )² = 1/(1 + 2Q + Q² )

So 1 - 1/(1 + 2Q + Q² ) = [ (1 + 2Q + Q² ) - 1 ] / (1 + 2Q + Q² )

Which is (2Q + Q² ) / (1 + 2Q + Q² )

So beta = sqrt( (2Q + Q² )/(1 + 2Q + Q² ) )

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Let's look again at the options.

Looking at option D: v_max= c√[1−1/(1 +kA²/(2 m c² ))^2 ]

Which is v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + Q )^2 ), where Q = k A²/(2 m c² )

Wait, that's exactly what I've got! Because beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + Q )^2 ), so v = c * beta.

So the expression in option D is v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which matches my result.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, earlier, (1/2)k A^2 = (gamma -1) m c^2. So gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

That's correct.

So, gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Thus, 1/gamma^2 = [ 1 / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]^2.

So, 1 - 1/gamma^2 = 1 - [1/(1 + Q )^2 ]

Which is the same as option D.

Wait, but option D says sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + ... )^2 ), so yes, that matches.

But wait, let me check the other options.

Option B is v_max= c√[1 + 1/(1− (kA²/(2 m c² )) ) ]

Hmm, no, because our expression is 1 - 1/(1 + ... )^2, which is not the same as 1 + 1/( ... )

So, perhaps option D is correct.

Wait, but let me think about another approach. The energy approach: the total energy is (1/2) k A^2 = (gamma -1) m c^2.

So gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2 ), so:

sqrt(1 - beta^2 ) = 1 / [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ]

Squaring both sides: 1 - beta^2 = 1 / [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ]^2

So beta^2 = 1 - [1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2) ))^2 ]

Which is what I have again. So beta = sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + ... )^2 ] )

Thus, v = c * beta → which is option D.

So the correct option is D.

Wait, but let me check the other options again to be sure.

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m)) )^2 )

That would suggest gamma is 1 + something, but in our case, gamma is 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ), so the denominator in option A's term would be 1 - (k A²/(2m) ), which is different, because in my case, it's 2m c^2 in the denominator.

So option A's denominator doesn't match.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2/(2 m c^2) )) )

Hmm, the denominator here is 1 - something, but in our case, it's 1 + something. So that's not matching.

Option C is the non-relativistic case, which would be correct if the speed was low compared to c, but the question is about the maximum speed, which could approach c if the amplitude is large, so it's relativistic.

Hence, the correct answer is option D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and spring constant \( k \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy considerations. The total energy of the oscillator is conserved, and at the maximum displacement \( x = A \), the potential energy is \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), while the kinetic energy is zero. At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum.

In the relativistic regime, the kinetic energy is given by \( (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Equating the total energy at maximum displacement to the kinetic energy at equilibrium, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma \), we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is also related to the velocity \( v \) by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \) into this equation, we solve for \( v \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches the expression given in **Option D**. The other options are inconsistent with the relativistic energy analysis:

- **Option A** and **Option B** involve incorrect denominators or terms that do not align with the derived expression.
- **Option C** corresponds to the non-relativistic case, which is not valid here since the problem explicitly involves relativistic effects.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
