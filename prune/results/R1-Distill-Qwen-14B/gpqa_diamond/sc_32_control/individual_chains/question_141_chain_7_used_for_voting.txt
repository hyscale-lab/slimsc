Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out how many possible products are formed when 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with sodium amide (NaNH2) in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but let me think this through.

Wait, so the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, wait, maybe that's 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene? Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene? No, wait, the name might be 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene. So, the benzene ring has a bromine at position 1 and two methyl groups at position 2. Oh, wait, no, the numbering might be different. If it's 1-bromo and 2-d, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene? Or maybe the 'd' is a typo. Oh wait, no, the correct name would probably be 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene. So, the structure is a benzene ring with bromine attached to carbon 1, and two methyl groups on carbon 2. So, it's a para-substituted structure? Wait, no, because 1 and 2 are adjacent positions. So, the bromine is at position 1, and two methyl groups at position 2.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation reactions, like in the formation of aromatic rings through elimination or for the formation of benzynes. Oh wait, but more accurately, in aromatic substitution, NaNH2 is used in the elimination of H2O or HX in certain conditions. Wait, but maybe in this case, it's about dehydrohalogenation.

Alternatively, I think when a halobenzene is treated with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia, it can undergo a elimination reaction, perhaps forming a benzyne intermediate. Because for example, in the case of 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, elimination of HBr would form a triple bond between carbons 1 and 2, leading to a benzyne structure. But wait, wait, the conditions here are NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I think that's a dehydrohalogenation condition, which typically requires a strong base to abstract a proton adjacent to the bromine, leading to the formation of a triple bond.

But wait, let me think about the structure again. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene, the bromine is on C1, and C2 has two methyl groups. So, the structure is:

Benzene ring with Br on C1, and two methyl groups on C2.

So, in this structure, we have a bromobenzene derivative with substituents in the ortho position.

Now, when NaNH2 is used, it's a strong base. So, perhaps it will abstract a proton that is beta to the bromine. Wait, where would those protons be? They need to be adjacent to the carbon bearing the Br, i.e., on the same carbon or on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, no, the Br is on C1. The adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. So, the H's that can be abstracted are either on C2 or C6.

But in this molecule, C2 already has two methyl groups. So, maybe the H's available for abstraction are on C6, which is ortho to Br.

Wait, let me draw this structure. Carbon 1 (C1) has Br; carbon 2 (C2) has two methyl groups. So, C1 is attached to Br, and C2 has two CH3 groups. The ring is benzene, so each carbon is connected. So, the positions around the ring are:

C1: Br
C2: two CH3 groups
C3: H
C4: H
C5: H
C6: H

Wait, that's correct? No, because in benzene, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons and one substituent or hydrogen. So, in this case, C1 is next to C2 and C6.

So, for the elimination reaction, the H's that can be abstracted are on C2 and C6. But wait, C2 has two methyl groups, so maybe no H's are available on C2? Because if C2 has two methyl groups, perhaps the only H's available are on C6.

Wait, or wait, each carbon in benzene is bonded to two other carbons and one substituent. So, if C2 has two methyl groups, that would imply perhaps that the structure is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene, which is correct.

So, in this structure, the C2 has two methyl groups, so perhaps the only H's adjacent to C1 (the Br) are on C2 and C6. Wait, but C2 is already substituted with two methyl groups, so maybe only C6 has H's available for elimination.

Wait, but if the base (NH2^-) abstracts a proton from C6, which is adjacent to C1 (Br), then elimination of HBr would form a triple bond between C1 and C6, creating a benzyne intermediate. But wait, that's not possible because C1 and C6 are adjacent? No, wait, in benzene, C1 and C2 are adjacent, C2 and C3 are adjacent, and so on, so C1 and C6 are adjacent. So, if we eliminate H from C6 (which is adjacent to C1), then we would form a triple bond between C1 and C6, making the benzyne structure.

But wait, benzynes are usually formed when there's a possibility for two adjacent substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has substituents in positions that allow for elimination.

Wait, in the case of 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene, the Br is on C1, and C2 has two methyl groups. So, if we eliminate H from C2, but wait, if C2 has two methyl groups, does that mean there are H's on C2? No, because each methyl group is CH3. So, each C2 would have two methyl groups, meaning the substituent is two methyl groups attached to C2. So, the structure is:

Benzene ring with Br on C1 and two CH3 groups on C2.

So, in this case, the adjacent carbons to C1 are C2 (which has two CH3) and C6. So, the only possible H's that can be abstracted for elimination would be on C6 and perhaps on C1's adjacent carbons.

Wait, but for elimination, the H needs to be on a carbon adjacent to the one bearing the Br. So, in this case, the H can be on C2 or C6. But C2 has two methyl groups, so perhaps no H's are available on C2. So, the only possible H's are on C6.

So, the base would abstract a H from C6, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6, eliminating HBr.

Wait, but wait, elimination would form a triple bond, not a double bond. Because when you eliminate HX from a dihalide, you form a triple bond. But wait, here we're dehydrohalogenating a mono-halide, so elimination would form a double bond. Or perhaps I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, no. Dehydrohalogenation of a mono-halide (like CH2BrCH3) would eliminate HBr and form an alkene (CH2=CH2 in that case). But in aromatic systems, elimination leads to the formation of a triple bond, which is a diradical or a benzyne intermediate.

Wait, perhaps in this case, the reaction would form benzyne. So, when NaNH2 is used with a bromobenzene derivative, it can abstract a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a triple bond (benzyne).

But wait, in order to form a triple bond, the adjacent carbons need to lose two H's. So, for example, in the case of 1-bromo-2-iodobenzene, eliminating H and I would form a triple bond between C1 and C2. But in our case, only Br is present. So, perhaps the same process applies.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The structure is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene. So, the Br is on C1, and C2 has two methyl groups.

If the base abstracts a H from C6 (the carbon adjacent to C1), then we have:

- The Br on C1.
- The H on C6 is removed, forming a double bond with C1. Wait, but that would create a double bond between C1 and C6, making a benzene ring with a double bond, but that's not possible because benzene is already fully conjugated. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, no, wait. I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the elimination process. When you eliminate HBr from a benzene ring, you form a triple bond because you lose two H's and the Br, but wait, no, in the case of a single Br, perhaps you only eliminate one H and the Br, forming a double bond.

Wait, but that would lead to a diradical or something else. Or maybe it's more about the formation of a benzynes intermediate, which requires adjacent substituents.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible products. If the reaction forms a benzyne intermediate, then the benzyne can undergo various reactions, like trapping with another molecule or forming different products.

Wait, but what's the starting material here? The starting material is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene. When treated with a strong base like NaNH2, it would likely eliminate HBr to form a triple bond between C1 and C6, creating a benzyne.

Wait, but wait, in that case, the benzyne would have substituents on C2 and perhaps others. So, if benzyne is formed, it can undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition or other reactions, but in the presence of a base, perhaps it's just the formation of the benzyne itself, which may be the major product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed because the necessary H's are unavailable. Wait, but in our structure, C6 has H's because it's a benzene ring. So, the base could abstract a H from C6. Then, with the Br on C1, elimination would lead to a triple bond between C1 and C6, creating a benzyne.

But in that case, how does the substitution pattern affect the possibility? Let's think. The starting material is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene. When the H from C6 is removed, the Br leaves, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. But wait, how does that look?

Wait, the structure would have a triple bond between C1 and C6, making a benzyne. But the presence of substituents on C2 (two methyl groups) would influence the stability of the benzyne.

Now, once the benzyne is formed, what happens next? Well, in the presence of ammonia, which is a nucleophile, perhaps the benzyne can react. But wait, NaNH2 is used in condensed ammonia, which is a deprotonation solvent, but also can act as a base.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne can undergo ring expansion or other reactions, but I'm not sure. Wait, another possibility is that the base could abstract a proton from another position, leading to different products.

Wait, let me think again. The starting material is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene. So, Br is at C1, two CH3 at C2. When NaNH2 is added, it will abstract a proton adjacent to Br. The possible adjacent positions are C2 and C6.

But C2 has two CH3 groups, so perhaps the H's on C2 are not available for abstraction. Therefore, the only available H's are on C6. So, the base would abstract a H from C6, leading to the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6, generating a benzyne intermediate.

But wait, wait. The benzyne is a highly strained molecule and is usually very reactive. So, it can react with other nucleophiles, but in this case, the solvent is ammonia, which might not provide a lot of nucleophiles except for the NH2^- ions.

So, when the benzyne is formed, it might capture an amide ion (NH2^-) as a nucleophile. But wait, benzyne is symmetric, so where would the attack happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne is so strained that it tends to dimerize or undergo some other reaction. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form a benzyne but instead undergoes some substitution. Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, not a nucleophile in substitution reactions. So, it's more likely an elimination reaction.

Let me think about the possible products. If the benzyne is formed, and then it reacts with something, but in this case, the solvent is ammonia. So, perhaps the benzyne can react with another equivalent of NaNH2 to form some product.

Wait, another thought: when benzyne is formed, it's a triple bond, so the ring becomes a diradical or a triple bond which can then undergo various additions.

Wait, but if the benzyne is formed, perhaps the reaction would stop there, and the product would just be the benzyne. Or, perhaps the benzyne could react with the solvent or another molecule.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton elsewhere, leading to different products.

Wait, another possibility: the elimination could result in more than one product, depending on which H is abstracted. But in our case, since the only available H is on C6 (since C2 is substituted with two methyl groups), there's only one possible site for elimination. Therefore, only one product is formed.

Wait, but wait. What about the possibility of forming a di-substituted benzyne? No, because in this case, the elimination would only create a single triple bond between C1 and C6.

So, the product would be the benzyne, which is 1,6-didehydrobenzene, but considering the substituents on C2, perhaps the structure would be that of 1,6-didehydro-2,2-dimethylbenzene.

Wait, but would that be a feasible structure? Let me think about the possibility of forming such a benzyne. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a different product.

Wait, maybe the reaction produces benzene with a triple bond, but I'm not sure about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed because the necessary H's are not available. But that can't be because C6 has H's.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond, but that's not possible. Wait, benzene is already a six-membered ring with alternating double bonds. So, forming a triple bond would mean that the ring would have a triple bond, which would create a different structure.

Wait, but benzyne is a cyclic triyne? No, benzyne is a six-membered ring with a triple bond, making it a diradical structure. So, the structure would have two adjacent carbons with a triple bond, and the rest as single bonds, leading to a highly strained molecule.

But regardless of that, the question is about the number of possible products. So, let's think about whether multiple products can form.

In this case, the starting material has a Br in position 1 and two methyl groups in position 2. When the base abstracts a proton from C6, elimination of HBr forms a triple bond between C1 and C6. So, the product would be a single benzyne structure.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is that the base could abstract a proton from a different position, leading to a different product. But in this structure, the only possible position for elimination is C6, because C2 has no H's available (due to the two methyl groups).

Therefore, only one product is formed: the benzyne.

But wait, the question is about the number of possible organic products. So, is there just one product?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form benzyne but instead undergoes some other reaction. For example, perhaps the base could deprotonate another position, leading to a different product.

Wait, another possibility: if the base abstracts a proton from another position, maybe leading to a different elimination product. But in this case, the only possible H's are on C6.

So, only one product is formed.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Maybe I should think of another possibility. Wait, if the Br is on C1 and C2 has two methyl groups, perhaps the elimination can occur in more than one way. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't eliminate but instead does something else, like a substitution.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, so substitution via an SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution) is possible, but that requires a good leaving group and a strongly activated ring. The ring here has a Br, which is a decent leaving group, but the ring is not particularly activated for SNAr. Plus, the substituents (two methyl groups) are electron-donating, which would deactivate the ring towards nucleophilic substitution. So SNAr is unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination reaction leading to a benzannulene or something else, but I'm not certain.

Another thought: maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a methyl group, but that doesn't make sense because the methyl groups are already present.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, forming a benzene ring with a triple bond, which would be the benzyne.

So, considering all this, the reaction leads to the formation of one product, the benzyne.

Wait, but wait. The starting material is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene. When the base abstracts a proton from C6, elimination of HBr occurs, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. So, the structure becomes a benzyne with two methyl groups on C2.

So, the product would be 1,2,2-trimethylbenzene? No, wait, after elimination, the Br is gone, and a triple bond is formed between C1 and C6. So, the product would be 1,6-didehydro-2,2-dimethylbenzene, which is a benzyne derivative.

But then, what is the structure of the product? Let me think. The benzene ring would have a triple bond between C1 and C2 (if the elimination is between C1 and C2) or between C1 and C6.

Wait, wait a second. If the H is abstracted from C6, which is adjacent to C1, then elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C6. So, the structure is then a six-membered ring with a triple bond between C1 and C6, and two methyl groups on C2.

So, the product is 1,6-didehydro-2,2-dimethylbenzene. But how many such structures are possible? Well, since the substituents are in fixed positions, only one product is formed.

Therefore, the number of possible organic products is 1.

So, the correct answer would be option B) 1.

When 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene is treated with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia, the reaction involves the strong base abstracting a proton adjacent to the bromine atom, leading to the elimination of HBr. The bromine is located on carbon 1 (C1), and carbon 2 (C2) has two methyl groups. The only available protons for elimination are on C6, which is adjacent to C1. 

The elimination of HBr forms a triple bond between C1 and C6, resulting in a benzyne intermediate. This benzyne has a highly strained structure with a triple bond between C1 and C6 and two methyl groups on C2. Since there is only one possible site for elimination (C6), only one product is formed.

Thus, the reaction produces a single organic product, which is 1,6-didehydro-2,2-dimethylbenzene (the benzyne derivative).
