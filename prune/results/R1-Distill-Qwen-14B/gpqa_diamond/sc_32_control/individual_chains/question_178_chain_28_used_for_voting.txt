Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and renormalizability. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. 

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that σ matrices are related to the generators of Lorentz transformations, but maybe that's not directly relevant here. 

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should recall the concept of mass dimension in quantum field theory. The mass dimension of an operator is determined by requiring that the Lagrangian has mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions. Each term in the Lagrangian must have [Lagrangian term]_M = 4.

So, looking at L_int, let me break it down into its components. The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}. Let's find the mass dimension of each part.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for a gauge field, right? Like in electromagnetism or non-Abelian gauge theories. The field strength F is made from the field A, presumably. The field A has a mass dimension of 1. Because in four dimensions, the covariant derivative is ∂ + i e A, and ∂ has dimension 1, so A must have dimension 1 to balance the terms. 

The field strength tensor F is typically ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ plus some nonlinear terms if it's non-Abelian. But regardless, each F has the same dimension as A, because the derivatives add dimension 1 each. Wait, wait. No, wait. Because F is made by derivatives acting on A. So F has dimension [∂][A] = 1 + 1 = 2. Because ∂ has dimension 1, and A has dimension 1. So F^{μν} has mass dimension 2.

Next, the spinor fields. The Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the equation of motion is the Dirac equation, and the action is dimensionless, so the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. The kinetic term is ψ̄ iγ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which has dimensions [ψ̄][ψ][∂]. Since [∂] is 1, [ψ̄][ψ] must be 3 (because 3+1=4). So each ψ has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ (which is ψ^† γ^0) also has dimension 3/2.

Now σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which are products of gamma matrices. The gamma matrices are dimensionless (they're just matrices), so σ has the same dimension as [γ,γ], which is zero. So σ is dimensionless. 

Putting it all together: the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ, ψ, and F. Let me compute the mass dimension of each part:

[κ] * [ψ̄] * [σ] * [ψ] * [F] = [κ] * (3/2) * 0 * (3/2) * 2.

Wait, let me calculate each part:

[ψ̄] = 3/2
[σ] = 0 (since it's made of gamma matrices)
[ψ] = 3/2
[F] = 2
κ is the coupling, which we're finding the dimension of.

So the product of the fields and σ is (3/2) * (3/2) * 2 = (9/4) *2 = 9/2.

So the entire term is [κ] * (9/2), and the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So:

[κ] * (9/2) = 4.

Wait wait, no, because L_int is part of the Lagrangian. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So [κ] must satisfy:

[κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = 4.

Wait, that's correct. Because each term is the product of the fields and the coupling. So the sum of the mass dimensions of all the factors in the term should be 4.

Wait, let me think again. Each factor in the term contributes its own dimension. So:

[κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = 4.

So plugging in the known values:

[κ] + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 4.

Adding them up: [κ] + (3/2 +3/2) is 3, plus 2 is 5. So 5 + [κ] =4 → [κ] =4-5= -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. 

Wait, that seems right. Because 3/2 (ψ̄) +3/2 (ψ) is 3. Plus F's 2 is 5. So κ must be -1 to get 4. Yep.

So [κ]_M is -1. Looking at the options, options A and C have -1, so B and D can be ruled out.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constant. In four dimensions, a theory is renormalizable if the coupling has mass dimension ≤ 0. Because each interaction term in the Lagrangian must have dimension ≤4, so each coupling's dimension must be ≤ (4 - sum of fields' dimensions).

Wait, more precisely, the mass dimension of the coupling (for a renormalizable interaction) must satisfy [coupling]_M ≥ -d, where d is the spacetime dimension. But in four dimensions, the condition is that the coupling must have mass dimension ≥ - (4 - sum of the fields' dimensions). Hmm, perhaps another approach is better.

Wait, for a term to be renormalizable, the dimension of the coupling must satisfy [g]_M ≥ - (d/2 - (n_f * (d_f/2)) ), but maybe that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, the general rule is that a term in the Lagrangian with coupling g must have [g]_M ≥ (d - (sum of fields' dimensions)) ), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact condition. Let me think.

In four dimensions, a Lagrangian term is renormalizable if [g]_M ≥ (4 - sum of the fields' dimensions). Because the term must have dimension 4 (since the Lagrangian has dimension 4 in four dimensions). So the sum of the coupling's dimension plus the sum of the fields' dimensions must equal 4. So [g]_M = 4 - sum [fields].

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because for each term, the product of the coupling and the fields must have dimension 4. So [g] + sum [fields] =4.

So, [g] =4 - sum [fields]. But for the interaction to be renormalizable, [g] must be ≥0. Because if [g] is negative, it implies the interaction is non-renormalizable (since you need infinitely many counterterms as you go to higher loops). Wait, no, I think it's the opposite. Because in four dimensions, a coupling with [g]_M <0 would lead to a term that's more relevant, but for renormalizability, terms must have [g]_M ≥0. 

Wait, I might be getting this mixed up. Let me think again. 

In a renormalizable theory, all divergences can be absorbed into a finite number of counterterms. The superficial degree of divergence is given by D = d - (n_vertices * [coupling]_M + ... ), but perhaps it's better to recall that a coupling with a positive mass dimension (or zero) is renormalizable, while a negative mass dimension coupling implies a non-renormalizable interaction.

Wait, no, wait. An interaction term with a coupling of dimension [g] must have that [g] ≥ (d - (sum of fields' dimensions)). For four dimensions, d=4. So if [g]_M ≥0, it's renormalizable. If [g]_M <0, it's non-renormalizable.

Wait, let me think about this: For a term g φ^n, the dimension is [g] + n * [φ] =4. So [g] =4 -n [φ]. For renormalizability, the term must have [g] ≥0. So 4 -n [φ] ≥0 → n [φ] ≤4.

In our case, the interaction is L = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. Let's think of this as a four-fermion interaction? Wait, no. Wait, no, because ψ is a spinor, and F is a tensor. So the term is more like a four-fermion term, but with F^{μν}.

Wait, the term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

So the number of fields in the interaction is four: two ψ, and two F (since F is antisymmetric, but perhaps in the term F^{μν} is a field, so perhaps it's F_{μν} as a field, but in any case, the term has ψ̄, ψ, and F^{μν}.

Wait, no, F^{μν} is a field tensor. So in terms of the number of fields, the term is ψ̄ (one field), ψ (another field), and F^{μν} (another field), but actually, in the term, it's F^{μν} multiplied by ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ. So the term is (ψ̄ σ F ψ), so it's four fields: two spinors and two vector fields? Or wait, no, F is a field, but σ is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of fields. Each field contributes its own mass dimension. So the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, ψ, and F^{μν}.

Wait, wait. Let me count: ψ̄ is one field, ψ is another, F^{μν} is another. So three fields in total. So the product of fields is ψ̄ ψ F^{μν} (and σ, which is dimensionless). So three fields.

So, the dimension would be [κ] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [F^{μν}] = [κ] + 3/2 + 3/2 +2 = [κ] + 3 + 2= [κ] +5. And this must equal 4.

Wait, that's already been established, because earlier we found that [κ] is -1, because 5 + (-1) =4.

But for renormalizability, the dimension of the coupling must satisfy [g] ≥0. Because in four dimensions, a coupling with [g] <0 leads to higher dimension operators (super-renormalizable?), but wait, I'm getting confused. 

Wait, no, another approach: the interaction term is L = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. The number of fields is 3: two spinor (ψ̄ and ψ) and one F^{μν}. 

But wait, F^{μν} is a field with spin-1 tensor, but in terms of the number of components, each F is like two vector fields (since F is antisymmetric). Wait, but in terms of the dimension, each F has dimension 2, so we can treat it as a field of dimension 2. So for each F, we have 2 dimensions. 

But I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Let's think about the superficial degree of divergence.

The superficial degree of divergence D is given by D = d - (n_vertices * [coupling]_M + (sum [field]_M * (momentum factors))).

Wait, but perhaps a simpler approach is to determine whether the interaction is renormalizable by looking at the mass dimension of the coupling. 

In four dimensions, a theory is renormalizable if all the couplings have mass dimension ≥0. Because if the coupling has a negative mass dimension, the interaction becomes relevant, and the theory is non-renormalizable. 

In our case, [κ] is -1, which is less than zero. So the coupling has negative mass dimension. Therefore, the interaction term would require higher and higher order terms, making the theory non-renormalizable.

Wait, but wait. So if the coupling has [g]_M = -1, which is negative, then the interaction is non-renormalizable. Because in four dimensions, any coupling with [g]_M <0 would imply that the term is of higher dimension, requiring an infinite number of counterterms, hence the theory is not renormalizable.

So the theory is non-renormalizable.

Putting it all together: [κ]_M is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.

So looking at the options, option C says [κ] is -1 and theory is not renormalizable. Option A says it's renormalizable, which can't be right.

So the correct answer is C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions. Breaking down the dimensions of each term:
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The adjoint spinor $\bar{\psi}$ also has $[\bar{\psi}]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has $[F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2$ (since it is derived from the gauge field $A_\mu$, which has $[A_\mu]_M = 1$).
- $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is a commutator of $\gamma$-matrices, which are dimensionless, so $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0$.

The interaction term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa]_M + [\bar{\psi}]_M + [\psi]_M + [F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 4.
\]
Substituting the known dimensions:
\[
[\kappa]_M + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
[\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimension ($[g]_M \geq 0$). In this case, the coupling $\kappa$ has $[\kappa]_M = -1$, which is negative. A negative mass dimension implies that the interaction term is of higher dimension, requiring an infinite number of counterterms to absorb divergences. Therefore, the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option **C**.
