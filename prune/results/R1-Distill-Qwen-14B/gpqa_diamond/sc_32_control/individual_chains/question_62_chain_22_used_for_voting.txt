Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think it through step by step. Let's try to break it down.

The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to figure out the structure.

So, the target has a cyclohexane ring. Attached to it is a methyl group that's connected to another cyclohexane (cyclohexyl) and a hydroxyl group (hydroxy). Also, there's a carbaldehyde group (the -CHO part) on the cyclohexane. So, putting that together, the molecule has two cyclohexane rings linked via a methyl group that also has a hydroxyl and an aldehyde.

Wait, no, maybe I should draw it out. The main chain is cyclohexane with a substituent. The substituent is a methyl group attached to both a cyclohexane ring (cyclohexyl) and a hydroxyl group. Also, the same cyclohexane has a carbaldehyde group. So, perhaps the structure is like cyclohexane with three substituents: a methyl group (which is attached to another cyclohexyl and hydroxy), and a formyl group (CHO).

Wait, but the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde—so cyclohexane with a -CHO group. The substituent is at position 1, which is the same carbon as the CHO. So, on that carbon, there's a methyl group attached to both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxy group.

Oh, right! So the structure is cyclohexane where one carbon (position 1) has three substituents: a formyl group (CHO), a methyl group that's connected to a cyclohexyl group, and a hydroxyl group. Wait, no, the formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the methyl is attached to the cyclohexane, and that methyl has two substituents: cyclohexyl and hydroxy. So the structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent at position 1, which is a methyl group connected to a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl.

So, starting from ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. So that's like cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Wait no, ethynyl is the substituent. Let me clarify: ethynylcyclohexane would have a cyclohexane ring with a -C≡C- group attached. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or maybe cyclohexane attached directly to the triple bond? Wait, actually, ethynyl is the acetylene group, so it's -C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH substituent.

So the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2-? No, ethynyl is the substituent. So I think it's cyclohexane with a substituent of -C≡CH (triple bond connected to the ring, then a CH2 group? Wait, no, ethynyl is the group -C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohexane would have a ring connected to a triple bond, like cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Hmm, maybe I should look up the structure. Wait, perhaps it's cyclohexane with a -CH2-C≡CH group. So the structure is cyclohexane where one carbon has a -CH2-C≡CH substituent.

Wait, no, I think it's more like cyclohexane with a -C≡CH substituent. So, the triple bond is directly attached to the cyclohexane. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, ethynyl is the group -C≡CH. So the starting material is cyclohexane with a substituent where the substituent is CH2-C≡CH? Or is it CH2-C≡C-CH2-? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Ethynyl is the substituent, so the molecule would be cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So, the structure is cyclohexane with a carbon ring, and one of the carbons is connected to a triple bond (C≡CH).

Now, how do we go from that to the target molecule, which has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (CHO group) and a substituted methyl group with cyclohexyl and hydroxy.

So, what reactions or steps are needed?

Let me think about the steps involved. The target has a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group and a substituted methyl group. The substituted methyl has a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group.

Let me consider possible reactions. One approach would be to form a ketone, then reduce to an alcohol, perhaps perform some kind of substitution or addition.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and a substituted methyl group attached. So perhaps the ethynyl group can be converted into a carbonyl group.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is like cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Hmm, but maybe I should think about the triple bond as a possible site for oxidation or hydration.

Wait, triple bonds can undergo various reactions. For example, hydration of an alkyne can give a ketone or an aldehyde, depending on the conditions. But wait, the triple bond is at the end, so maybe it's possible to get a carbonyl group from it.

Alternatively, the ethynyl group could be converted into an alkyne, perhaps through some substitution or addition.

Wait, let me think about the reagents in the options. The options have reagents like NaNH2, methyl chloride, H2 with Pd, Ba(OH)2, H2SO4 and HgSO4, H2O, Li and liquid NH3, O3 with H2O or (CH3)2S, and NH4OH.

Hmm, so NaNH2 is a strong base, used for deprotonation. Methyl chloride is a methylating agent. H2 with Pd is hydrogenation. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, used for elimination or maybe for epoxide opening. H2SO4 and HgSO4 are for acid-catalyzed reactions, like in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids. Ozone is for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. Li in liquid NH3 is a strong reducing agent, maybe for Birch reductions or for deprotonating.

So, perhaps the first step is to functionalize the ethynyl group.

Looking at the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane. Let's say we have a triple bond attached to the cyclohexane. To get a formyl group, perhaps we can oxidize the triple bond. But wait, oxidation of terminal alkynes (like RC≡CH) can give carboxylic acids under certain conditions, but maybe with stronger oxidizing agents.

Alternatively, perhaps using a dihydroxylation or some addition.

Wait, another approach: Maybe we can perform a hydration of the alkyne to form a ketone. For example, using HgSO4 and H2SO4 (like in the oxymercuration reaction) but wait, oxymercuration is for alkenes, not alkynes. Wait, no—maybe for alkynes, hydration would give ketones.

Wait, I remember that when a terminal alkyne (like RC≡CH) is treated with HgSO4 and H2SO4, it can be converted into a ketone (RCO). So in this case, the ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane with -C≡CH) would become cyclohexanecarbonyl (so a ketone group, cyclohexanone). But wait, the target has a formyl group, not a ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via another method.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent. But maybe that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond.

Wait, looking at the target, the substituent is a methyl group attached to the cyclohexane, which in turn is attached to another cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl. So perhaps that methyl group is formed from the alkyne.

Wait, maybe the approach is to first add a group to the alkyne, then perform some kind of ring expansion or substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a vinyl group, which can then undergo some addition.

Wait, let's think about each step in the options.

Looking at option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate

3. O3/ (CH3)2S

4. Ba(OH)2

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. Methyl chloride (CH3Cl) is a methylating agent. So perhaps the first step is a deprotonation followed by alkylation. But where would the proton be? For ethynylcyclohexane, perhaps the alkyne is acidic. The alkyne protons are more acidic than alkenes or alkanes, but I'm not sure about their exact acidity.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, usually used for deprotonating compounds with acidic protons. For example, in the Birch reduction, or in forming enolates. So maybe the first step is deprotonating the ethynylcyclohexane to form an alkyne anion, then methyl chloride would methylate it.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond. The alkyne is R-C≡CH. Deprotonating would give R-C≡C⁻, which could then react with a methylating agent like CH3Cl. So adding CH3+ from CH3Cl would give R-C≡C-CH3, which is an internal alkyne. So the first step would convert ethynylcyclohexane into 1-methylcyclohexylacetylene (if I'm getting the structure right). Wait, but adding a methyl group to the triple bond would make it R-C≡C-CH3, perhaps.

Then the second step is H2 with Pd and CaCO3. That's hydrogenation. So hydrogenating the triple bond would convert the alkyne into a single bond. So R-C≡C-CH3 would become R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no—hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and Pd would add two hydrogens, turning the triple into a single bond, so R-C≡C-CH3 becomes R-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Let me think: The triple bond is R-C≡C-R'. Upon hydrogenation (with H2 and a catalyst like Pd), it would add H across each bond, turning into R-CH2-CH2-R'. But wait, perhaps in this case, the alkyne is R-C≡C-CH3, so hydrogenation would give R-CH2-CH2-CH2-R'? No, wait, the triple bond is between two carbons. R-C≡C-CH3 would hydrogenate to R-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the triple is between two carbons. So R-C≡C-CH3 on hydrogenation would become R-CH2-CH2-CH3? Or perhaps R-CH2-CH2-CH3 is not correct. Wait, R-C≡C-CH3 has three carbons? Let me think, for example, ethynylcyclohexane is C6H11-C≡CH. So after methylating, it's C6H11-C≡C-CH3. Then, hydrogenation would add H across the triple bond, making it C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3. So that would give a cyclohexane with a propyl group attached? Wait, but the target doesn't have a propyl group.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not on the right track. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is forming a Grignard reagent. Wait, NaNH2 is used in some deprotonation steps, but methyl chloride is a methylating agent. So perhaps the first step is methylating the alkyne. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: Let me think of the target molecule and see what functional groups I need to reach.

The target has a formyl group (-CHO) and a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the cyclohexane. So perhaps the formyl group comes from an oxidation of a carbon chain, and the hydroxyl comes from a reduction or some addition.

Wait, let me think about possible steps.

1. Convert the ethynyl group into a carbonyl group. So ethynylcyclohexane (R-C≡CH) could be oxidized to R-CO-H. But wait, that would be a ketone, not an aldehyde. To get an aldehyde, perhaps the oxidation needs to be controlled. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via some other means.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then reduced to a secondary alcohol, which can be oxidized further. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the triple bond is used to form a ring. For example, in a cyclopropane formation, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, the target has two cyclohexane rings connected via a methyl group. So perhaps the ethynyl group is used to form a bridge between two cyclohexane rings.

Hmm, that's getting a bit complicated. Let's think about possible reactions.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to form a cyclopropane ring, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is used to install a substituent via substitution. For example, using NaNH2 and methyl chloride—could that be an alkylation?

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, maybe deprotonating the alkyne to form an acetylide. Then, methyl chloride could methylate it. So R-C≡CH + NaNH2 → R-C≡C⁻ + NH3. Then, adding methyl chloride would give R-C≡C-CH3.

So after step 1, we have R-C≡C-CH3 (maybe 1-methylcyclohexylacetylene).

Then, step 2 is H2 with Pd and CaCO3. That's hydrogenation, so the triple bond becomes a single bond. So R-C≡C-CH3 → R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would give a cyclohexane with a propyl group. But our target doesn't have a propyl group. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon as the methyl and hydroxyl. So maybe this step is about forming that substituent.

Let me think again. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main ring is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (CHO group), and the substituent at position 1 is a methyl group that's attached to another cyclohexane (so a cyclohexyl group) and a hydroxyl group.

So, perhaps the methyl group comes from the alkyne, and the cyclohexyl comes from another part.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to make a ketone, then perform a Grignard reaction.

Wait, perhaps the initial ethynyl group is converted into a ketone. For that, perhaps using HgSO4 and H2SO4, which are oxidizing agents. So if we have ethynylcyclohexane (R-C≡CH), treatment with H2SO4 and HgSO4 (option A's step 3) would oxidize the triple bond. But I'm not sure about the product of that oxidation. Typically, terminal alkynes can be oxidized to carboxylic acids using strong oxidizing agents like KMnO4 under acidic conditions. So R-C≡CH → R-COOH.

But in the target, the substituent is a CHO group, not a COOH. So maybe that's not the way.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is reduced. Let me think: the alkyne could be hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond. Then, undergo addition reactions.

Wait, but the target has a CHO group, which suggests an aldehyde, which is an oxidized state from an alcohol.

Hmm, maybe the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via some steps.

Wait, another approach: The target has a formyl group. So perhaps the starting alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group. Let's think, maybe via hydration.

Wait, but I thought earlier that hydration of an alkyne would give a ketone. But maybe in some cases, with specific conditions, it can give an aldehyde. Or perhaps the alkyne is first converted into an alkene, which is then oxidized.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve converting the alkyne into an alkene, then performing an oxidation to form the aldehyde.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me look at the options again. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different steps.

Looking at option C:

Reagents:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne treated to form an acetylide, then methylated.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkane.

Wait, that can't be right. Because hydrogenation of an alkyne (triple to single) would require adding two H2's, turning into an alkane. So R-C≡C-CH3 → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But the target has a methyl group attached to a cyclohexyl and hydroxyl. So maybe the hydrogenation leads to a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps after hydrogenation, the molecule becomes R-CH2-CH2-CH3, and then some cleavage happens.

Looking at step 3 in option C: O3 and (CH3)2S → ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. But if step 2 is hydrogenation of an alkyne to a single bond, then step 3 is ozonolysis, which requires a double bond. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is: alkylate the alkyne, then hydrogenate to a double bond, then ozonolyse.

Wait, let's think again. If step 1 converts the alkyne into R-C≡C-CH3. Then step 2 is hydrogenation. But wait, what if step 2 is partial hydrogenation, turning the alkyne into an alkene? Because hydrogenation of an alkyne can be controlled to stop at the alkene stage (cis or trans, depending on conditions). So, perhaps using H2 and a poisoned catalyst like Lindlar's catalyst would give cis alkene, but if it's just H2 and Pd, maybe it goes all the way to the alkane.

Wait, but in option C, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. That's a standard catalyst for complete hydrogenation. So it would turn the alkyne into an alkane, which is R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But then step 3 is ozonolysis, which requires a double bond. That doesn't fit, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is deprotonation and alkylation to form R-C≡C-CH3. Then step 2 is hydrogenation but only adds one H2, making an alkene. But I don't think H2/Pd would stop at the alkene; it would go all the way to the single bond.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the target molecule again.

The target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group. So perhaps that comes from oxidizing a cyclohexylmethanol group. Wait, so maybe we need to form a secondary alcohol and then oxidize it.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a secondary alcohol, then oxidized to a ketone, and then further processed.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is used to form a Grignard reagent, which then is quenched to form an aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, CH3Cl → probably forms an acetylide and methylates it.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenation of the alkyne to CH2 group.

3. Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination reaction.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → could be oxidation.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → ethylation.

2. Li/liq NH3 → maybe a Birch reduction or deprotonation.

3. O3, H2O → ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH → work up after ozonolysis.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → same as A.

2. H2/Pd, CaCO3 → hydrogenation.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis, with (CH3)2S as a reductive workup, which would give aldehydes.

4. Ba(OH)2 → strong base, maybe elimination.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps forming an acetylide and then something else.

Wait, but methanol is a polar aprotic solvent, perhaps used in alkylation.

Wait, let's try to model each option.

Option C:

Step 1: NaNH2, CH3Cl → ethynylcyclohexane becomes methyl-substituted alkyne.

So R-C≡CH → R-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2, Pd/CaCO3 → hydrogenates the alkyne to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's a three-carbon chain. So the cyclohexane would have a -CH2-CH2-CH3 group.

But the target has a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So perhaps that's not the right path.

Alternatively, maybe I'm thinking of the wrong structure.

Wait, another way: The target has a methyl group attached to a cyclohexyl and hydroxyl. So perhaps the methyl is linked to a cyclohexane ring in a bridge structure.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possibility of forming a new ring.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the ethynyl group is used to perform a cyclopropanation, but I don't think that's part of the options.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is used in a conjugate addition or some other reaction.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve forming a ketone from the alkyne, then undergoing a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Wait, let me think about the formyl group in the target. It's a carbaldehyde (-CHO), which is an aldehyde group attached to the cyclohexane. So perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: Oxymercuration or hydration of the alkyne. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe using OsO4 for dihydroxylation, but that's for alkenes.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol, which then can be oxidized.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then reduced to a secondary alcohol, which is oxidized to a carboxylic acid, then reduced to an aldehyde.

But that's a lot of steps, and looking at the options, most have 3 or 4 steps.

Wait, perhaps the correct path is as follows:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride to form a methyl-substituted alkyne.

2. Hydrogenation reduces the alkyne to an alkane, perhaps forming a bridge.

3. Ozonolysis of a double bond to form carbonyl groups.

4. Workup with a base to eliminate or form the desired structure.

Wait, perhaps after hydrogenation and ozonolysis, some rings are formed.

Alternatively, maybe the initial steps are for installing substituents, and the latter steps for oxidation.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to outline each option's possible pathway.

Option C:

Step 1: NaNH2, CH3Cl → forms R-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenation → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but then step 3 is O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis, which needs a double bond. But in step 2, the triple is hydrogenated to a single bond, so no double bond. So this doesn't make sense. So perhaps option C is wrong.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2, methanol → perhaps deprotonating and then forming an acetylide, but then reacting with methanol? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is forming a Grignard-like reagent, but I'm not certain.

Option B:

Step 1: NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkyne becomes R-C≡C-Et.

Step 2: Li, NH3 → perhaps a Birch reduction, which would add a ring, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, Li in NH3 is a strong base, could deprotonate something.

Step 3: O3, H2O → ozonolysis.

Step 4: NH4OH → workup, perhaps to form carbonyl groups.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how this sequence would lead to the target.

Option A:

Step 1: NaNH2, CH3Cl → R-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2 → strong base, maybe elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and can cause elimination reactions, like forming an alkene via E2. So if we have R-CH2-CH2-CH3, after elimination, it becomes R-CH2-CH2-CH2 → no, because that would need adjacent Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is R-CH2-CH2-CH3, and eliminating H2O or something else to form a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the target molecule and the reagents needed to form the substituents.

The target has a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached to a cyclohexane with a formyl group.

Wait, perhaps the methyl group comes from the alkyne, and the cyclohexyl is from another cyclohexane that's added.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to make a new cyclohexane ring attached via the alkyne.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the alkyne is converted into a benzyl-type group, then used in a coupling reaction. But that's probably beyond the scope of the options given.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is used to form a ketone, which is then subjected to a Aldol condensation, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the key is the formyl group. Let's think about how to get that.

If I have a cyclohexylmethanol, I can oxidize it to cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So perhaps the steps involve forming an alcohol that can be oxidized to the aldehyde.

So, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into an alcohol, then oxidized.

But how? Let's see.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then subjected to hydration to form a diol, but that's for alkenes.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone, then reduced to a secondary alcohol, then oxidized to the aldehyde.

Wait, but how to get the secondary alcohol.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent, which is then quenched to form an alcohol.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, which could deprotonate the alkyne, forming an acetylide. Then, adding methyl chloride would alkylate the acetylide, forming R-C≡C-CH3. Then, hydrogenation would convert the alkyne to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But then, how to get the formyl group and the hydroxyl group.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a step where the R-CH2-CH2-CH3 is oxidized to a ketone, which is then reduced to an alcohol.

Wait, but that would require more steps than the options provide.

Alternatively, perhaps after hydrogenation, the molecule undergoes ozonolysis to break a double bond. But in this case, after hydrogenation, the molecule is R-CH2-CH2-CH3, which doesn't have a double bond. So ozonolysis wouldn't work.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the steps. Let me try to think again.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2, methanol → perhaps deprotonating the alkyne and then reacting with methanol. Methanol is a nucleophile, so maybe the acetylide attacks methanol, but I'm not sure about the specifics.

Step 2: Li, liquid NH3 → perhaps a Birch reduction, which reduces aromatic rings, but the starting material isn't aromatic. Alternatively, it could be deprotonating something else.

Hmm, not sure.

Option B:

Step 1: NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkyne becomes R-C≡C-Et.

Step 2: Li, NH3 → perhaps a reduction or deprotonation.

Step 3: O3, H2O → ozonolysis.

Step 4: NH4OH → workup.

So, after step 1, R-C≡C-Et.

Step 2: Li in NH3 is a strong base. Could deprotonate something—maybe the ethyl group? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a trans-alkene via some method, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps after step 1, the alkyne is R-C≡C-Et. Step 2: Li/NH3 (Birch conditions) could reduce the alkyne to a trans-alkene. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Then, step 3: ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups. So, R-C=C-Et would become R-CHO and Et-CHO perhaps. But then step 4: NH4OH is a mild reducing agent, maybe to reduce the ozonides to aldehydes.

But the target has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and a substituted methyl group. So perhaps this is the right path.

Wait, but in option B, after ozonolysis, we would get two aldehyde groups. But the target has only one formyl group. So perhaps that's not the case.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to identify which option leads to the correct functional groups.

The target has a formyl group and a hydroxyl group attached to the same carbon as a cyclohexyl group.

So perhaps the steps involve:

1. Convert alkyne to alkene.

2. Oxidize to form a ketone.

3. Reduce to secondary alcohol.

4. Then, perform some kind of substitution to introduce the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups.

But I'm not seeing how that would fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is introduced via oxidation of a primary alcohol.

So the steps would be:

- Convert the alkyne to a primary alcohol.

- Oxidize the primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

But how to get the primary alcohol from the alkyne.

Wait, perhaps through hydroboration-oxidation, but that's for alkenes.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl via some method, then reduced to an alcohol.

Wait, another idea: Ozonolysis can be used to cleave alkenes into carbonyl groups, but how does that fit here?

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is first converted into an alkene, then subjected to ozonolysis to form a carbonyl.

But without a double bond, ozonolysis isn't applicable.

Wait, perhaps option C:

After steps 1 and 2, the molecule has a longer chain which, after ozonolysis, would break into smaller fragments with carbonyl groups.

But I'm not quite getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne is converted to a ketone.

2. The ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol.

3. The secondary alcohol is oxidized to a ketone again, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, but after step 2 in option C, the molecule is R-CH2-CH2-CH3. How can that form the -CHO group?

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about each step again.

Option C:

1. NaNH2 and CH3Cl: forms R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-CaCO3: reduces triple bond to single, R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S: but R-CH2-CH2-CH3 doesn't have a double bond, so ozonolysis can't act. So perhaps option C is not the right path.

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me think about the product after step 2 in option C: the alkyne is fully hydrogenated to R-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes something like cyclohexane with a -CH2-CH2-CH3 substituent.

But the target has a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So perhaps after that, we need to form a ring.

Wait, perhaps step 3 (ozonolysis) isn't applicable, so option C must be wrong.

Looking at option A:

Step 1: NaNH2 and CH3Cl → R-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2 → strong base, perhaps elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, but R-CH2-CH2-CH3 has no H on adjacent carbons to eliminate, so that wouldn't form a double bond. So maybe step 3 is oxidation.

Step 3 in option A: Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Could it cause some kind of elimination, but I'm not seeing how.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxide opening, but that's not relevant here.

Hmm.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → perhaps forming a methyl ether or something else. Not sure.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → perhaps a Birch reduction. But I don't see how that would help.

Hmm.

Option B:

Step 1: NaNH2, ethyl chloride → R-C≡C-Et.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → perhaps a Birch-like reduction, turning the alkyne into an alkene.

Wait, but I thought Birch is for aromatic rings. Alternatively, Li in NH3 could be a deprotonating agent, but I'm not certain.

Step 3: O3, H2O → ozonolysis, which would cleave a double bond into carbonyl groups.

Step 4: NH4OH → workup, perhaps to form aldehydes.

But how does that lead to the target structure.

Alternatively, maybe after step 2, the alkyne is converted into a trans-alkene, which upon ozonolysis would break into two aldehyde groups.

But the target only has one aldehyde group, so perhaps that's not the right path.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the correct sequence logically.

We need to form a compound with a formyl group and a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl substituent.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Convert the ethynyl group into a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde).

2. Perform a reduction to form an alcohol.

3. Then, perhaps form a ring to create the cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is used to install a methyl group, which is then functionalized.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne is deprotonated and alkylated (steps 1 of options A, B, C, D).

2. Hydrogenated to form a single bond (step 2).

3. Ozonolysis to break the chain into smaller fragments (step 3).

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized.

Wait, perhaps after step 2 in option C, the molecule is R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, ozonolysis wouldn't do anything because there's no double bond. So perhaps this isn't the right option.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a cis-alkene (using a catalyst like Lindlar's), then subjected to ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups. But looking at the options, none of them have a step where hydrogenation stops at the alkene stage.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me try to outline its steps again.

Option C steps:

1. NaNH2 and CH3Cl → R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S → but no double bond, so nothing happens? Doesn't make sense.

So perhaps option C is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the steps are different. Maybe the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation, then further processed.

Wait, looking at option A's steps:

3. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's for ketones.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps after step 3, the Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C because it's the only one that uses ozonolysis with a reductive workup, which forms aldehydes.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to R-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenated to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ozonolysis isn't applicable, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation isn't complete. Maybe step 2 is a partial hydrogenation to form a double bond.

Wait, if step 2 is hydrogenation with H2 and a catalyst that stops at the alkene, like using Lindlar's catalyst, then we'd have R-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond.

But the options don't specify the catalyst used. Option C says H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which usually leads to complete hydrogenation.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 forms a cyclohexene ring via some addition.

Wait, perhaps after step 1, the alkyne is R-C≡C-CH3. Then, hydrogenation could add H2 across the triple bond in a way that forms a cyclohexane ring. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a benzyl group, but that's not part of the target.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

The target has a formyl group and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as a cyclohexyl group. So perhaps the steps involve forming a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone, but that doesn't fit directly with the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then reduced to a secondary alcohol, then oxidized to an aldehyde. But I'm not seeing that in the options.

Wait, looking at option C again:

After step 3, which is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, the reagent is a reductive workup, which would form aldehydes. So maybe the molecule after step 2 has a double bond that is cleaved into two aldehyde groups.

So, if after step 2, the molecule is R-CH2-CH2-CH3, then there's no double bond for ozonolysis. So perhaps that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that the hydrogenation step in option C creates a double bond.

Wait, no. Hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and Pd typically leads to a single bond, not a double bond.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option C, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct, but I'm not seeing why.

Another approach: Let's consider each option's final step.

Option C's final step is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. It could cause elimination, perhaps forming a double bond or a ring.

Wait, so after step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which forms aldehydes. Then, Ba(OH)2 could cause some kind of elimination, perhaps forming a ring.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C because the steps would form the formyl group and then eliminate to form the cyclohexane ring.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is the correct sequence because ozonolysis would generate the aldehyde group, and Ba(OH)2 would help in forming the cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not entirely confident. I think I'm going to have to make a guess based on the reasoning, but I'm not fully certain.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) and a substituted methyl group attached to another cyclohexane ring and a hydroxyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Converts the terminal alkyne into a methyl-substituted alkyne (R-C≡C-CH₃).
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to an alkane (R-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃).
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, potentially for elimination, but the structure after step 2 lacks functional groups for this to lead directly to the target.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Likely for oxidation, but the sequence does not clearly form the required functional groups.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Converts the terminal alkyne into an ethyl-substituted alkyne (R-C≡C-Et).
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for deprotonation or reduction, but the role here is unclear.
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is absent after step 2.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup for ozonolysis, but the sequence does not align with forming the target structure.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Converts the terminal alkyne into a methyl-substituted alkyne (R-C≡C-CH₃).
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to an alkane (R-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃).
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is absent after step 2, making this step ineffective.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, potentially for elimination or ring formation, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the target.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Likely forms an acetylide, but the role of methanol is unclear.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for reduction or deprotonation, but the role here is unclear.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is absent after step 2.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup for ozonolysis, but the sequence does not align with forming the target structure.

### Conclusion:
The target molecule requires the formation of a formyl group and a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl substituent. None of the options provide a clear and logical sequence to achieve this. However, **Option C** is the most plausible because it includes steps that could potentially form the required functional groups, even though the reasoning is not fully consistent with the final structure.
