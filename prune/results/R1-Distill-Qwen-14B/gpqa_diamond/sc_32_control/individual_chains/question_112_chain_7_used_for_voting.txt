Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that we have an electron state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I know that spin states are typically orthonormal, meaning <up|down> = 0 and each has a norm of 1.

The first part of the question asks me to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds a bit tricky. So for a 2x2 matrix (since we're dealing with spin-up and spin-down), the diagonal elements are zero, and all off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So the matrix would look like:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2 0   ]

Hmm, that's a 2x2 matrix. I remember that for a 2-level system, such a matrix represents an operator that's a spin component in some other direction, but maybe not exactly. Alternatively, I think this kind of matrix is sometimes associated with the Pauli matrices, but scaled. Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this A is like (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

Wait, but regardless of that, the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of σ_x. So the eigenstates of A would be the eigenstates of σ_x. Let me think. The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because σ_x flips the spin states.

So the question is, we have |alpha> expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, and we need to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of A when we measure the operator A. That is, we can express |alpha> as a linear combination of the eigenstates of A, and the coefficients' squared magnitudes would be the probabilities.

But wait, |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. But we don't know the normalization. So first, I should normalize |alpha>.

Let me compute the norm of |alpha>. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. The inner product <alpha|alpha> is |1+i|² + |2 -i|².

Calculating |1+i|²: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Wait, |a + ib|² is a² + b². So yes, |1+i|² = 1^2 +1^2=2. Similarly, |2 -i|² = (2)^2 + (-1)^2=4+1=5. So the total norm is 2 +5=7. So |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> divided by sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Now, the eigenstates of operator A are the eigenstates of σ_x. Let me denote them as |+x> and |–x>:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|–x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |–x>.

Let me write |alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |–x>

So, substituting the expressions for |+x> and |–x>:

|alpha> = c_+ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c_- (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Factor out |up> and |down>:

= [ (c_+ + c_-)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (c_+ - c_-)/sqrt(2) ] |down>

But we know |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

So, equating coefficients:

( c_+ + c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (1 + i) / sqrt(7)
( c_+ - c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i) / sqrt(7)

Let me write these as two equations:

Equation 1: (c_+ + c_-) = (1 + i) sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)
Equation 2: (c_+ - c_-) = (2 - i) sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)

I can solve these two equations for c_+ and c_-.

Adding equations 1 and 2: 2 c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Compute numerator: (1+2) + (i -i ) = 3. So 2 c_+ = 3 sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

So c_+ = (3 sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1: 2 c_- = [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Compute numerator: (1-2) + (i +i ) = (-1) + 2i.

So 2 c_- = (-1 +2i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
=> c_- = [ (-1 + 2i ) sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7) )

But I need the coefficients to find the probabilities. The probabilities are |c_+|² and |c_-|².

Compute |c_+|²:

c_+ = (3 sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(7)) )

So |c_+|² = (9 * 2 )/(4 *7) ) = (18)/(28) ) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857...

Similarly, |c_-|²:

c_- = [ (-1 + 2i ) sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7) )

Let me compute the magnitude squared.

| (-1 + 2i ) |² = (1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5.

So |c_-|² = (5 * 2 )/( 4 *7 ) )= (10)/(28)=5/14≈0.357142...

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I did that correctly.

Wait, sqrt(2) squared is 2, and the denominator is (2 sqrt(7))²=4 *7=28.

So yes, |c_-|²= (5 * 2 )/(28)=10/28=5/14.

Wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.36. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857. So that's about 0.64 and 0.36.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (≈0.64) for |+x> and 5/14 (≈0.36) for |-x>.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36, but let me check that.

Option A says probabilities 0.64, 0.36 and average hbar/7.

So the first part is done, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, the second part is finding the average value of the operator A.

The operator A is given by the matrix with 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. So A = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] which is (ħ/2) σ_x.

The expectation value <A> is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since |alpha> is normalized, because it's already divided by sqrt(7).

So, let's compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, because A is (ħ/2) σ_x, and σ_x has eigenvalues ±1 for the eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, but wait, when you take expectation value, it's the sum of the probabilities multiplied by the eigenvalues.

Wait, because |alpha> is a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>, which are eigenstates of A.

Wait, A |+x> = (ħ/2)(1) |+x>, because σ_x |+x> = |+x>. Similarly, A |-x> = (ħ/2)(-1) |-x>.

Wait, no, wait. σ_x |+x> = |+x>, because |+x> is an eigenstate of σ_x with eigenvalue +1. So A |+x> = (ħ/2) * 1 |+x> = (ħ/2) |+x>.

Similarly, A |-x> = (ħ/2) * (-1) |-x>.

So, the expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha> = |c_+|² (ħ/2)(1) + |c_-|² (ħ/2)(-1).

Substituting the values we found:

|c_+|² =9/14, |c_-|²=5/14.

So <A> = (9/14)(ħ/2)(1) + (5/14)(ħ/2)(-1)
= [ (9 * 1) - (5 * 1) ] * (ħ/2) /14
= (4 * ħ/2 ) /14

Wait, 9/14 * (ħ/2) is (9 ħ)/(28), and 5/14 * (-ħ/2) is (-5 ħ)/(28). Adding them: (9-5) ħ/(28) =4 ħ/(28)= ħ/(7).

So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says average is hbar/7. So the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and average is ħ/7. That matches option A.

Wait, let me double-check the average value calculation.

Another approach: compute <A> as <alpha| A |alpha>.

Express A as (ħ/2) σ_x. The expectation value is (ħ/2) <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

But sigma_x is represented by the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So <alpha| is [ (1-i) , (2+i) ] / sqrt(7).

So <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> is [ (1-i)  (2+i) ] + [ (2+i) (1-i) ] divided by 7.

Wait, let me compute each term:

sigma_x |alpha> = |down> coefficient (1+i) |up> + |up> coefficient (2-i) |down> ?

Wait, no, sigma_x swaps |up> and |down>.

So sigma_x |alpha> = (1+i)|down> + (2-i)|up>.

So <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> is:

(1-i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) all divided by 7.

Let me compute each term.

First term: (1 - i)(2 - i) = (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i +i². i² is -1, so 2 -3i -1= (1 -3i).

Second term: (2 + i)(1 + i) = 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i = 2 +2i +i +i² = 2 +3i -1= (1 +3i).

Add these two terms: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So <sigma_x> = 2 /7.

So <A> = (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

Which matches what I found earlier.

So putting it all together, the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36), and the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and ħ/7 → correct.

Option B: 0.54, 0.46 and 3ħ/sqrt(7) → not matching.

Option C: 0.28, 0.72 → probabilities don't match.

Wait, 9/14 is 0.64285… which rounds to 0.64, and 5/14 is 0.357, which is ~0.36. So option A is correct.

So the answer would be option A.

The problem involves an electron state \( |\alpha\rangle \), proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of the \( z \)-component of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) for \( i \neq j \) and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The given state is \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize, compute the norm:
\[
\| |\alpha\rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix},
\]
which corresponds to \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
These are the eigenstates of \( A \), with eigenvalues \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

### Step 3: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
Substitute the expressions for \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) into \( |\alpha\rangle \):
\[
|\alpha\rangle = c_+ |+x\rangle + c_- |-x\rangle,
\]
where:
\[
c_+ = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}},
\]
\[
c_- = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]
After simplifying:
\[
c_+ = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_- = \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
\[
c_+ = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_- = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate probabilities
The probabilities of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are \( |c_+|^2 \) and \( |c_-|^2 \), respectively:
\[
|c_+|^2 = \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad |c_-|^2 = \left(\frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 5: Compute the average value of \( A \)
The expectation value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]
Since \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), and \( |\alpha\rangle \) is expressed in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), the expectation value becomes:
\[
\langle A \rangle = |c_+|^2 \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + |c_-|^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substitute \( |c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \):
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} - \frac{5}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). These results match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
