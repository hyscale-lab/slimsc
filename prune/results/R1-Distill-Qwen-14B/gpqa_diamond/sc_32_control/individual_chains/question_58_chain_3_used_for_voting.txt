Okay, so I've got this question about physical theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to remember what regularization is. From what I recall, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, which are like infinities that pop up in calculations. These divergences can make the math blow up, so regularization helps by introducing a temporary cutoff, like a maximum energy scale, to make the calculations finite. Then you can take the cutoff to infinity in a controlled way, hopefully getting a finite result through renormalization.

So the question is asking which theory doesn't need this regularization. Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, incorporating gravity and quantum mechanics. Wait, but strings are tiny, and they vibrate at different energies. Since string theory is supposed to be a background-independent theory, maybe it doesn't have the same kind of divergences as the other theories do. Or does it? Wait, I remember that in string theory, the concept of a "string" replaces point particles, which might change how divergences appear. Plus, string theories have something called the Regge behavior, but I'm not sure if they require regularization. Or maybe because they're background-dependent in some formulations, they might need it. I'm a bit confused here.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that at low energies, QCD is non-perturbative, which is why things like quark confinement happen. But at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), QCD becomes weakly coupled because of asymptotic freedom. So QCD calculations at high energies are manageable. But do they require regularization? Well, in perturbative calculations, you might still get divergences, like in loops. So you would need to regularize, perhaps using methods like dimensional regularization or lattice methods. So I think QCD does require regularization, at least in the perturbative approach.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I remember that when QED was being developed in the 40s, they had problems with divergences. For example, the electron self-energy diverges. So they had to introduce a cutoff, like a high momentum cutoff, which led to the idea of renormalization. Without regularization, the theory wouldn't make sense because the infinities would ruin the calculations. So QED definitely requires regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, wait! This is the classical version, not the quantum one. Classical theories don't involve the same kind of divergences as quantum theories do. In Maxwell's equations, you don't have loop diagrams or infinities. So in classical E&M, you don't need regularization because it's not a quantum field theory. But wait, are there any issues with divergences in classical E&M? Like, for point charges, there's the issue of infinite self-energy, but that's more a conceptual problem in the classical theory. But in practice, when you're solving problems in classical E&M, you don't regularize. So maybe this is the correct answer.

So putting it all together: the question is which theory doesn't require regularization. The options are A (Superstring), B (QCD), C (QED), D (Classical ED).

QED and QCD are quantum theories and require regularization. Superstring theory, being a quantum theory, might also require some form of regularization, but I'm not entirely sure. But wait, superstring theory is supposed to be finite. I think in string theory, the perturbation series is finite. Unlike QED, which has divergences at all orders, string theory doesn't have the same kind of problems because the way the interactions happen (through stringy effects) avoids the usual divergences. So perhaps superstring theory doesn't need regularization.

Wait, if that's the case, then option A is a possible correct answer. But wait, the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So between A and D.

Wait, another angle: regularization is a quantum field theory concept. So any theory that isn't a QFT doesn't need it. So classical ED is not a QFT, so it doesn't require regularization. So the correct answer would be D.

So the options are, which theory never requires regularization. The answer is D, Classical Electrodynamics.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the options as follows:

1. **Option A: Superstring Theory**  
   Superstring Theory is a quantum theory that incorporates gravity and is a candidate for a theory of everything. While it avoids some of the divergences seen in quantum field theories (QFTs) due to its unique structure, it still involves quantum interactions and may require regularization in certain formulations. However, it is noted for being potentially finite, depending on the framework.

2. **Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**  
   QCD, the theory of the strong interaction, involves perturbative calculations where divergences arise. Techniques like dimensional regularization or lattice methods are used to handle these divergences. Thus, QCD requires regularization.

3. **Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**  
   QED, the quantum theory of electromagnetism, is well-known for requiring regularization. Infamous examples include the divergences in electron self-energy and photon vacuum polarization, which necessitate regularization and renormalization.

4. **Option D: Classical Electrodynamics**  
   Classical Electrodynamics (Maxwell's equations) is not a quantum theory. While it has conceptual issues like infinite self-energy for point charges, it does not involve the divergences inherent to quantum field theories. Therefore, it does not require regularization.

Given this analysis, the theory that never requires regularization is **Classical Electrodynamics**.
