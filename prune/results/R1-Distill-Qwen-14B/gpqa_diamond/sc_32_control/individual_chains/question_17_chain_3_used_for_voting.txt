Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm. Let's see what it says. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Alright, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, so it's a 1:1 ratio. The formation constant, K, is given, which tells me how strong the complex is. A larger K means the complex is more stable, so the reaction goes to completion.

Wait, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. Stoichiometric usually means the molar ratio is exact, so the concentration of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- in solution should be equal, right? Because each Ca^2+ binds one EDTA^4-.

But wait, no, because when they form the complex, the total concentration of Ca is tied up in the complex. So, the total concentration of Ca in solution is the concentration of the complex, which is 0.02 M. But wait, no, the complex is Ca-EDTA, so the concentration of free Ca^2+ would be something else.

I think I'm getting confused. So, the problem is about dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- ions. The formation constant K for the complex is given. The formula for K is [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the total concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M. Now, I need to find the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions.

Assuming that the complex dissociates as Ca-EDTA ↔ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-. The K is 5e10. So, K = [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] / [Ca-EDTA].

Wait, no, the formation constant is for the formation of the complex. The formation reaction would be Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ Ca-EDTA^2-. The formation constant Kf is [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-}).

So, the dissociation would be the reverse, with K = 1/Kf. So, the dissociation constant for the complex would be Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

But wait, in the solution, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote [Ca-EDTA] as 0.02 M. Now, when it dissociates, the concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- will be equal, because the stoichiometry is 1:1.

Let me let x be the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions. So, [Ca^2+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [Ca-EDTA] is approximately 0.02 - x. Since Kd is small (since Kf is large), the dissociation is minimal, so x will be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So the equation becomes Kd = (x)(x) / 0.02 = x² / 0.02. Kd is 2e-11.

So, x² = 0.02 * Kd = 0.02 * 2e-11. Let's calculate that.

0.02 is 2e-2. So, 2e-2 * 2e-11 = 4e-13. So x² = 4e-13.

Taking square root, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, and sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7.

Wait, no. Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-7)^2, so sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5, which is 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, but wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So sqrt(4e-13)= 2e-6.5. 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7 M. Oh wait, that's exactly option C: 6.3e-7.

So the concentration of Ca^2+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M. So the answer should be option C.

But let me double-check the Kd calculation. Kd = 1/Kf. Kf is 5e10, so Kd is 2e-11. That's correct.

So the equation is x² = (Kd) * [Ca-EDTA] = 2e-11 * 0.02.

2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13. So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, which is 6.32e-7, so 6.3e-7 M.

Yes, that's option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{Ca-EDTA} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

The total concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Let \( x \) represent the concentration of free \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) ions. At equilibrium, the concentrations of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \) are both \( x \), and the concentration of the complex is approximately \( 0.02 - x \). Since \( K_d \) is very small, \( x \) is negligible compared to 0.02, so \( [\text{Ca-EDTA}] \approx 0.02 \).

The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{Ca-EDTA}]}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
K_d = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = K_d \cdot 0.02 = (2 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot 0.02 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
