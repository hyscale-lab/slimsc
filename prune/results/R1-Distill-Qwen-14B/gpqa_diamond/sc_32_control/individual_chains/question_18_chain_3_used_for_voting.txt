Okay, so I have this question about stellar abundances, and I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the [X/Y] notation represents the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y relative to the Sun. Oh wait, right, it's log10(X/Y) in solar units.

The given data: Star_1 has [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, and Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. Also, Star_1 has [Fe/H]_1 = 0, and Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2 = 0. Wait, but what's the Sun's composition? The Sun has 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7. So that means nFe/nH is 10^(7.5 -12) = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, nMg/nH is 10^(-5).

Wait no, wait. Let me think. The notation is a bit confusing. The Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So, rearranging, log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. Therefore, nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg, log10(nMg/nH) =7-12=-5, so nMg/nH = 10^(-5).

Now, I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So, [Si/Star_1] over [Si/Star_2], or wait, no, the question is the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres. So, (nSi in Star_1) / (nSi in Star_2) = ?

Wait, let me clarify. The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So, (nSi1)/(nSi2).

To find this, I think I need to find the [Si/H] for each star, then use their [X/H] values to compute the ratio.

Because [X/H] is log10(nX/nH) - log10(nX/nH)_sun. Wait, no, actually, [X/H] = log10(nX/nH) - log10(nX/nH)_sun. So, [X/H] = log10( (nX/nH) / (nX/nH)_sun ) ).

So, if I can find the [Si/H] for each star, then I can find their nSi/nH values, and then take the ratio.

But wait, how do I get [Si/H] for each star?

For Star_1: We have [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 and [Fe/H]_1=0.

Wait, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so log10(nFe/nH)_star1 - log10(nFe/nH)_sun =0 → log10(nFe/nH) for star1 is same as sun. So nFe/nH in star1 is same as sun, 1e-4.5.

Then, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10(nSi/nFe) =0.3 → nSi/nFe =10^0.3 ≈ 2.

So nSi = nFe * 2. Since nFe is same as sun's, which is 1e-4.5 → nSi = 2 * 1e-4.5.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again.

Wait, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log10(nSi/nFe) =0.3 → nSi = nFe * 10^0.3.

But since Star_1 has the same Fe/H as the Sun ([Fe/H]_1=0), nFe/nH in Star_1 is same as Sun's. So nFe for Star_1 is (nFe)_sun * (nH_star1 / nH_sun). Wait, no, because [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - sun's log. Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, nFe/nH in Star_1 is same as in Sun. So, nFe = (nH) * (nFe/nH)_sun.

But wait, for the purposes of this problem, perhaps I can express everything in terms of solar ratios and then compare.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to express [Si/H] for each star.

Let me proceed step by step.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1=0 → [Fe/H] = log10( (nFe/nH)_1 / (nFe/nH)_sun ) )= 0 → (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun.

So, (nFe)_1 = (nH)_1 * (nFe/nH)_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → [Si/Fe] = log10( (nSi/nFe)_1 / (nSi/nFe)_sun ) )=0.3.

So, (nSi/nFe)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_sun * 10^0.3.

But (nSi/nFe)_sun is (nSi_sun / nFe_sun ) = (nSi_sun) / (nFe_sun ). But wait, I don't know the Sun's [Si/Fe]. Hmm, perhaps I can find it.

Wait, the Sun's abundance:

We know nFe/nH_sun =10^(-4.5).

nMg/nH_sun =10^(-5).

But what about nSi/nH_sun? Hmm, maybe I can find it if I know [Mg/Si]_sun. Wait, but in the Sun, [Mg/Si] is not given. Oh wait, in the question, the given values are for the stars, not the Sun.

Wait, the question says "Consider the following photospheric composition for the Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7." So, the Sun's [Mg/Fe] can be computed.

Wait, Sun's [Mg/Fe] is log10( (nMg/nH_sun) / (nFe/nH_sun) ) ) = log10( (nMg/nFe)_sun ) = log( (1e-5) / (1e-4.5) ) = log(1e-0.5) )= -0.5.

So [Mg/Fe]_sun = -0.5.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

But perhaps I don't need the Sun's [Si/Fe], but rather I can relate the stars' abundances.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the [Si/H] for each star.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]=0 → (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun = FeH_sun.

And [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → (nSi/nFe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_sun.

So, (nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_1 * (nFe/nH)_1 = [10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_sun] * FeH_sun.

But (nSi/nFe)_sun = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) = (nSi_sun)/(nFe_sun).

But I don't know nSi_sun. Hmm, but perhaps I can relate it via Mg.

Wait, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → (nMg/nSi)_2 =10^0.3 * (nMg/nSi)_sun.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → (nMg/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_sun = MgH_sun = 1e-5.

Wait, but how to find [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the [Si/H] for both stars and then take the ratio.

Let me outline the steps:

1. For Star_1:
   a. [Fe/H]_1=0 → (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun = FeH_sun = 1e-4.5.
   b. [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → (nSi/nFe)_1 =10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_sun.
   c. So, (nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_1 * (nFe/nH)_1 = [10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_sun ] * FeH_sun.
   d. (nSi/nH)_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_sun * FeH_sun.

2. For Star_2:
   a. [Mg/H]_2=0 → (nMg/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_sun = MgH_sun =1e-5.
   b. [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → (nMg/nSi)_2=10^0.3 * (nMg/nSi)_sun.
   c. So, (nSi/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_2 / (nMg/nSi)_2 ) = (MgH_sun) / (10^0.3 * (nMg/nSi)_sun )
   d. (nSi/nH)_2 = (1e-5) / (10^0.3 * (nMg/nSi)_sun )

But I need to relate (nSi/nFe)_sun and (nMg/nSi)_sun to express both [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2.

Wait, perhaps I can find (nMg/nSi)_sun from the Sun's known abundances.

Wait, the Sun's Mg/H is 1e-5, and Fe/H is 1e-4.5.

But what about Si/H?

Wait, perhaps the Sun's [Mg/Si] can be found, but I don't have that.

Wait the Sun's [Mg/Si] is log( (nMg/nH) / (nSi/nH) ) = log( MgH_sun / SiH_sun )= log(1e-5 / SiH_sun ) = [Mg/Si]_sun.

But I don't know [Mg/Si]_sun, because it's not given.

Hmm, perhaps I can find [Mg/Si]_sun from the data provided.

Wait, but I don't think so. Maybe an alternative approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps I can express the ratio (nSi1)/(nSi2) in terms of their [Si/H] values.

Because (nSi1)/(nSi2) = (SiH1 * SiH_sun) / (SiH2 * SiH_sun) ) / ( (nSi2/nH2) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) ), wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, (nSi1) = nH1 * (nSi/nH)_1.

Similarly, (nSi2) = nH2 * (nSi/nH)_2.

But the ratio (nSi1)/(nSi2) = (nH1/nH2) * ( (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2 )

Hmm, but I don't know the ratio of the hydrogen in the two stars. Oh wait, but in stellar atmospheres, the total hydrogen is considered as a reference, so perhaps the ratios can be determined without knowing the absolute H.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is [ (nSi1) / (nSi2) ] = (nSi1 / nH1) / (nSi2 /nH2) ) * (nH1 /nH2).

Wait, but I don't know (nH1 /nH2). Hmm, maybe I can assume that the H is the same in both? No, that's not correct. Each star has its own H abundance.

Wait, but perhaps I can express everything in terms of the Sun's abundance. Because [X/H] is defined relative to the Sun.

Wait, for Star_1:

[Si/H]_1 = [Si/H]_sun + [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1.

Wait, is that correct? Wait, knowing that [X/H] = [X/Fe] + [Fe/H].

So, for Star_1:

[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3. Wait, but I need [Si/H]_2.

Hmm, but how? Because I have [Mg/Si]_2 and [Mg/H]_2.

Wait, I can express [Si/H]_2 in terms of [Mg/Si]_2 and [Mg/H]_2.

Because [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

Because:

log10( (nMg/nSi)_2 ) = [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3.

But [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H].

Because [Mg/Si] = log( (nMg/nSi) ) = log( (nMg/nH) / (nSi/nH) ) = log( (nMg/nH) ) - log( (nSi/nH) ) = [Mg/H] - [Si/H].

So, [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

Given [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

So, 0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Wait, that makes sense. So, Star_2 has [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

Similarly, for Star_1, [Si/H]_1=0.3.

So, now, the [Si/H] for Star_1 is 0.3, and for Star_2 is -0.3.

So, the [Si/H]_1 = log10( (nSi1 / nH1 ) / (nSi_sun / nH_sun )) ) = 0.3.

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 = log10( (nSi2 / nH2 ) / (nSi_sun / nH_sun )) ) = -0.3.

So, taking the ratio of nSi1/nH1 to nSi2/nH2:

(nSi1 /nH1 ) / (nSi2 /nH2 ) ) = 10^[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 ].

Which is 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) ) = 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, approximately 4.

Wait, but wait. Let me check.

Wait, [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, which means (nSi1/nH1) is 10^(0.3) times (nSi_sun /nH_sun).

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 is -0.3 → (nSi2/nH2) = 10^(-0.3) times (nSi_sun /nH_sun).

So the ratio (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2 ) = [10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun)] / [10^-0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun)] ) = 10^(0.3 +0.3 )=10^0.6≈3.98.

So the ratio is approximately 3.98, which is about 4. But wait, the question is the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So it's (nSi1)/(nSi2) = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH1/nH2 ) * (nH2/nSi2) ).

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because:

(nSi1)/(nSi2) = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH1/nH2) * (nH2/nSi2) )

Which is (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) ) * (nH2/nH1).

Wait, but I don't know the ratio of nH1 and nH2. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Because the ratio of (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) ) gives me 3.98, but I have to multiply by (nH2/nH1) to get (nSi1/nSi2) = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH2/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) ?

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let's think again.

I have (nSi1)/(nSi2) = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) * (nH2) )

So, (nSi1)/(nSi2) = [ (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) ] * (nH1 /nH2 )

But I don't know (nH1 /nH2 ), so this might not be the way to go. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the ratio is (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ), which is 3.98. But this is the ratio of (nSi/nH) in each star, not the ratio of nSi itself.

Wait, but the question is the ratio of silicon atoms (nSi1/nSi2). So, nSi1/nSi2 = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) * (nH2) )

Which can be written as (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) ) * (nH1/nH2 )

But I don't know (nH1/nH2 ), but perhaps I can find it via other means.

Wait, but perhaps the ratio (nH1/nH2 ) is the same as the ratio (nFe1/nFe2 ), because [Fe/H]_1 is 0 and [Fe/H]_2 is ? Wait, Star_2's [Fe/H] is not given. Oh wait, Star_2's [Mg/H] is 0, but not [Fe/H].

So, I don't have information about the Fe abundance in Star_2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the ratio of H in the two stars is the same as the ratio of Fe, but I don't think that's correct.

Wait, considering that for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0, so nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

For Star_2, since [Mg/H]_2=0, nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun.

But what about nFe2/nH2? I don't have that value, as [Fe/H]_2 is not given.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of silicon atoms is the same as the ratio of (nSi/nH) between the two stars, because the H in each star's photosphere might have the same proportion relative to each other as the Sun's.

Wait, but that's not necessarily true. Because each star could have a different nH.

Alternatively, perhaps the [X/H] values are given, so the H is not the same between stars. So, I might need to find the ratio of (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ), which is 10^0.6, and then assume that (nH1/nH2 ) is 1? No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] to find the ratio of H in the two stars.

Wait, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2/nH2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun.

But I don't have information about the Fe abundance in Star_2, so I can't directly find the ratio of H between the two stars.

Hmm, perhaps I need to make an assumption here. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of H cancels out when taking the ratio of [Si/H] for both stars. Because [Si/H]_1 = 0.3, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3, so the ratio of (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2 )=10^(0.3 - (-0.3))=10^0.6≈3.98.

But wait, the question is the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So that's (nSi1)/(nSi2) = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) * (nH2) )

Which is [ (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) ) ] * (nH1/nH2 )

But without knowing (nH1/nH2 ), I can't compute this.

Wait, but without more data, perhaps the question assumes that the H is the same in both stars, which would make the ratio (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2 ) = 3.98, which is approximately 4. The options have option A as ~3.9, which is close to 4.

But I'm not sure if this is correct because I think the ratio of H could affect the result. Wait, but maybe the problem assumes that the H is the same in both stars, which would make the ratio (nSi1)/(nSi2 )=3.98.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem only asks for the ratio of the silicon to hydrogen ratio, which would be 3.98, but the question says 'ratio of silicon atoms', which would require knowing the actual number, not relative to H.

But I'm stuck because I don't know the H ratio. Wait, maybe the problem assumes that the H is the same in both stars, which is a common assumption in such problems when not given additional data.

If that's the case, then (nSi1)/(nSi2 )= (nSi1/nH1 )/(nSi2/nH2 ) ) * (nH1/nH2 ) = (3.98) * (1) =3.98≈4.

So the ratio would be approximately 4, which is close to option A, ~3.9. But the options don't have 4, the closest is A at ~3.9. But wait, let me compute 10^0.6 more accurately.

10^0.6 is approximately 3.98, so about 3.98, which is ~4. So option A is ~3.9, which is very close. Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation would give something else.

Wait, but wait, the [Si/H]_1 is 0.3 and [Si/H]_2 is -0.3. So the ratio is 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) =10^0.6.

10^0.6= about 3.98, so the ratio is approximately 3.98, which is ~4.

But looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, option D is ~1.2.

Wait, option A is ~3.9, which is very close to 4. So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the [Si/H]_2 calculation.

Wait, for Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2=0.3, [Mg/H]_2=0.

[Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H].

So 0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

So [Si/H]_1=0.3, [Si/H]_2=-0.3.

So, the ratio (nSi1/nH1 )/(nSi2/nH2 )=10^(0.3 - (-0.3))=10^0.6≈3.98.

But the actual ratio (nSi1)/(nSi2 ) is that multiplied by the (nH2/nH1 ). Because (nSi1)/(nSi2 ) = (nSi1/nH1 * nH1 )/(nSi2/nH2 * nH2 ) ) = [ (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) ) ] * (nH1/nH2 )

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let's see:

nSi1 = (nSi1/nH1 ) * nH1.

nSi2 = (nSi2/nH2 ) * nH2.

So, the ratio nSi1/nSi2 = [ (nSi1/nH1 ) / (nSi2/nH2) ) ] * (nH1 / nH2 )

So, if I don't know (nH1/nH2 ), I can't compute the ratio of nSi1 to nSi2.

Hmm, but the problem doesn't give any data about the hydrogen abundance between the two stars. So perhaps the question assumes that the hydrogen is the same in both stars, making nH1 =nH2. Then, the ratio would be (nSi1/nH1 )/(nSi2/nH2 ) ) = ~3.98.

But I'm not certain if that's a valid assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to find the ratio of silicon to hydrogen in each and then take the ratio, which would be 3.98, and that's what the answer is, but the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms, which would be the same as the ratio of (nSi1/nH1 )/(nSi2/nH2 ), assuming the same H.

Wait, but that's only if the H is the same. So, perhaps the intended approach is to find that ratio.

So, the answer is approximately 3.98, so option A is ~3.9, which would be the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given abundance data and use the relationships between elemental abundances.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3 dex
   - [Fe/H]₁ = 0 dex

   From [Fe/H]₁ = 0, the Fe abundance relative to hydrogen in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Using [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3, the silicon abundance relative to iron in Star_1 is \( \text{nSi/nFe}_1 = 10^{0.3} \). Combining this with the Fe/H ratio, the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen in Star_1 is \( \text{nSi/H}_1 = 10^{0.3} \times \text{nSi/H}_\odot \).

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3 dex
   - [Mg/H]₂ = 0 dex

   From [Mg/H]₂ = 0, the magnesium abundance relative to hydrogen in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun. Using [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3, the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen in Star_2 is \( \text{nSi/H}_2 = 10^{-0.3} \times \text{nSi/H}_\odot \).

3. **Sun's Composition**:
   - \( \text{nFe/H}_\odot = 10^{-4.5} \)
   - \( \text{nMg/H}_\odot = 10^{-5} \)

### Ratio of Silicon Abundances:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{\text{nSi}_1}{\text{nSi}_2} = \frac{\text{nSi/H}_1}{\text{nSi/H}_2} = \frac{10^{0.3} \times \text{nSi/H}_\odot}{10^{-0.3} \times \text{nSi/H}_\odot} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}.
\]

### Calculation:
\[
10^{0.6} \approx 3.98.
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately \( 3.98 \), which corresponds to option **A (~3.9)**.

ANSWER: A
