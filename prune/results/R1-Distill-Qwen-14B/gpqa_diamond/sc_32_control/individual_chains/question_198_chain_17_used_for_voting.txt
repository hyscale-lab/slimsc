Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Okay, let's read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution.

Hmm, okay. So, I think the key here is to determine the distribution of the various cobalt complexes present in the solution. Since thiocyanate can form complexes with cobalt in different stoichiometries, each with their own stability constants, the distribution depends on these β values, the concentrations of Co²+ and SCN⁻, and the formation of different complexes.

Wait, the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^n- where n varies. The stability constant β tells us the tendency of the complex to form. Higher β means more stable (more favored) complex.

The four stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Typically, for a metal ion, the stability constants for complexes with multiple ligands (like [Co(SCN)]^x, [Co(SCN)_2]^y, etc.) are given in a stepwise manner. So, β1 would be for the first SCN⁻ ligand, β2 for the second, and so on.

Wait, no. Actually, the stability constants are usually given as the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So, βn would be the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) because Co²+ has a +2 charge, and each SCN⁻ is -1. So, for n SCN⁻, the charge would be 2−n. 

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think: For the first complex, [Co(SCN)]^+, the charge would be (Co²+ ) + (−1) = +1. So, the formation constant K1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co²+][SCN⁻]) = β1 = 9.

Similarly, for the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is neutral. The formation constant K2 would be [Co(SCN)_2]/([Co²+][SCN⁻]^2) = β2 =40. Wait, but wait, the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^+ → K1 = β1 = 9.

The second complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, with K2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/([Co²+][SCN⁻]^2) = β2 =40.

Similarly, K3 is [Co(SCN)_3]^- / ([Co²+][SCN⁻]^3) = β3=63. K4 is [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} / ([Co²+][SCN⁻]^4) = β4=16.

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem states the stability constants as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So, these are the successive formation constants. The larger β indicates a more stable complex. So, the third complex [CoSCN]_3^- has the highest stability constant, meaning it's the most favored, followed by the second, then the fourth.

But wait, β4 is lower than β3. So, the fourth complex is less stable than the third. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. So, the order is β3 > β2 > β1, then β4 is lower than β1. Wait, no, β4 is 16, which is lower than β1=9? No wait, β1 is 9, β4 is 16. So, β4 is higher than β1. So β3 is the highest, β2 is next, then β4, and then β1 is the lowest. Wait no, wait, β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the order of β is β3>β2>β4>β1. So, the third complex is the most stable, followed by the second, then the fourth, then the first. Interesting.

Wait, but wait, how do we relate the distribution of the species to these β values? So, the different complexes will form depending on the concentrations and their stability.

The total cobalt concentration is c(Co)=1e-2 M. That's the sum of all possible Co species, including free Co²+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^−, [Co(SCN)_4]^{2−}, and any others, but I think the problem is considering up to four SCN ligands.

Wait, but the problem mentions "dithiocyanato" complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN ligands. So, the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, I think. So, we're looking for the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2] in the total.

So, the plan is: calculate the fraction of each complex, sum them all, and find the percentage contributed by [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

But how do we calculate the fractions? I think we can use the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions to find the relative amounts.

The approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex relative to the free Co²+ ion.

The general formula for the fraction of each complex is given by the product of the β values and the ligand concentrations raised to the appropriate power, divided by the sum of all such terms plus 1 (for free Co²+).

Wait, but for each complex, the fraction is (βn * [SCN-]^n ) / (1 + β1 [SCN]^1 + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + ... + β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4 ). Hmm, but perhaps it's more efficient to think in terms of the conditional formation constants.

Alternatively, the distribution can be calculated using the formation constants and the ligand concentration.

So, the idea is that each subsequent complex has a higher order of ligand binding, and the fractions depend on the product of the stepwise formation constants and the ligand concentration.

Let me recall the formula. The fraction f_n of the complex with n SCN ligands is given by:

f_n = (β1 β2 β3 ... βn [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN]^3 + ... + β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, but in this case, the stability constants are given as successive β1, β2, etc., which are the stepwise constants. So, the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands is K_n = β1 β2 β3 ... βn. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the stepwise formation constants are for each successive addition. So, K1 = β1, K2 = β1β2, K3 = β1β2β3, K4=β1β2β3β4.

Hmm, wait, no. Let me think. The formation constant K_n for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} is the product of the stepwise formation constants from Co²+ to [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}.

So, K1 = β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co²+][SCN⁻])

K2 = [Co(SCN)_2]^0 / ([Co²+][SCN⁻]^2) = β1 * β2.

Similarly,

K3 = K2 * β3 = β1β2β3,

K4 = K3 * β4 = β1β2β3β4.

So, in this problem, the given βs are the stepwise constants, so the overall K for each complex is the product up to that step.

But I'm a bit confused because the problem gives four βs, but for four complexes. So, n can be 1,2,3,4. So, the possible complexes are [CoSCN]^+ (n=1), [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2), [Co(SCN)_3]^- (n=3), and [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} (n=4).

But the problem is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, so n=2.

So, to find the fraction f_2 of [Co(SCN)_2]^0, we can compute it as:

f_2 = (K2 [SCN]^2) / (1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, but wait, the denominator is sum over all possible species, including free Co²+.

Alternatively, perhaps the fractions are calculated using each K_n multiplied by [SCN]^n, and then normalized by the sum of all terms (including 1 for Co²+).

So, the total concentration of cobalt is c_total = [Co²+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

Each of these terms can be expressed in terms of [Co²+] and the Ks.

Because for each complex n, [Co(SCN)_n] = K_n [Co²+][SCN]^n.

So, [Co²+] is the free ion, and each complex's concentration is K_n [Co²+] [SCN]^n.

Thus, the total concentration is:

c_total = [Co²+] ( 1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4 )

Therefore, [Co²+] = c_total / (1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, but [Co²+] can be expressed in terms of the other species, but perhaps it's easier to compute the fractions directly.

The fraction of each species is (K_n [SCN]^n) / (1 + K1 [S] + K2 [S]^2 + K3 [S]^3 + K4 [S]^4 )

Where [S] is [SCN^-].

Wait, no, because each K_n is the overall formation constant for that complex, so the fraction for each complex is (K_n [S]^n) over the sum of all (K_m [S]^m) for m=0 to 4, where K_0=1.

Wait, that makes sense. So, in this case, f_n = (K_n [S]^n) / (sum_{m=0}^4 K_m [S]^m )

Wait, no, because K_0 is 1, which corresponds to the free Co²+.

Wait, let me clarify:

Each complex [Co(SCN)_n] has a formation constant K_n = β1 β2 ... βn. So,

K_0=1 (free ion),

K_1=β1,

K_2=β1 β2,

K_3=β1 β2 β3,

K_4=β1 β2 β3 β4.

So, the fraction of each complex is:

f_n = (K_n [S]^n) / (sum_{m=0}^4 K_m [S]^m )

Then, the sum is 1 + K1 [S] + K2 [S]^2 + K3 [S]^3 + K4 [S]^4.

But in our problem, the given β's are the stepwise constants, so K1=β1=9, K2=β1 β2= 9 *40= 360, K3=9*40*63= 22680, K4=9*40*63*16 = 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680 *16= 362880.

Wait, wait, let me compute these:

β1=9,

β2=40,

β3=63,

β4=16.

So,

K1 = β1 =9,

K2= β1 * β2=9 *40=360,

K3= β1 β2 β3=9 *40 *63 = 9 * 40=360, 360 *63=22680,

K4=β1 β2 β3 β4=9 *40 *63 *16.

Let's compute that:

9 *40=360,

360 *63=22680,

22680 *16=362,880.

So K4 is 362,880.

Now, [S] is given as 0.1 M.

So, we can compute each term in the denominator:

Term for m=0: 1.

m=1: K1 [S] =9 *0.1=0.9.

m=2: K2 [S]^2=360*(0.1)^2=360*0.01=3.6.

m=3: K3 [S]^3=22680*(0.1)^3=22680 * 0.001=22.68.

m=4: K4 [S]^4=362880 * (0.1)^4=362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

So, sum all these terms:

1 + 0.9 =1.9,

+3.6 → 5.5,

+22.68 →28.18,

+36.288 →64.468.

So the denominator sum is approximately 64.468.

Now, the fractions for each species:

f_0: 1 /64.468 ≈0.01551 (about 1.55%),

f_1: (9 *0.1)/64.468 →0.9 /64.468 ≈0.01396 (1.396%),

f_2: (360 * 0.01) /64.468 →3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05557 (5.557%),

f_3: (22680 * 0.001)/64.468 →22.68 /64.468 ≈0.3518 (35.18%),

f_4: (362880 * 0.0001)/64.468 →36.288 /64.468 ≈0.5628 (56.28%).

Wait, but wait a minute. Wait, the fractions should sum to 1. Let me check:

0.0155 + 0.01396 ≈0.02946,

+0.05557 →≈0.085,

+0.3518 →≈0.4368,

+0.5628 →≈0.9996. Oh, that's about 1. So maybe the calculations are correct.

But wait, the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is n=2. So, the fraction f_2 is 5.557%.

Wait, but that's about 5.5%, but looking at the options, the choices are 16.9%, 25.6%, 38.1%, 42.3%. So 5.5% is not among the options. Hmm, that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no, perhaps I swapped the definitions of the formation constants. Because sometimes the stability constants are given as log K, and sometimes as the overall K. Wait, no. The problem states they're stability constants, which are typically K values. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the terms.

Wait, let's recheck the calculations.

Compute each term:

m=0: K0=1 → term=1.

m=1: K1=9, [S]=0.1 → 9 * 0.1=0.9.

m=2: K2=360, [S]^2=0.01 →360 *0.01=3.6.

m=3: K3=22680, [S]^3=0.001 →22680 *0.001=22.68.

m=4: K4 =362880, [S]^4=0.0001 →362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum:1 +0.9 =1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468. That looks correct.

So, the fractions for each complex:

f_0: 1/64.468 ≈0.0155 →1.55%.

f_1: 0.9/64.468 ≈0.01396 →1.40%.

f_2:3.6/64.468 →0.05557 →5.56%.

f_3:22.68/64.468 →≈0.3518 →35.18%.

f_4:36.288/64.468 →≈0.5628 →56.28%.

So, the sum is approximately 1.55 +1.4 +5.56 +35.18 +56.28 → which totals about 100% (1.55+1.4=2.95; +5.56=8.51; +35.18=43.69; +56.28=99.97 → about 100%).

But the problem is, the answer options don't include 5.5%. So I must have a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the definition of the stability constants. Maybe the β values are given as the overall K for each complex, not the stepwise ones.

Wait, if that's the case, then K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16.

Wait, but let me think. Is it possible that the β values are the overall formation constants for each complex, not the stepwise ones?

In that case, the problem is different.

Wait, the question says: the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, etc. So, perhaps each βn is the overall stability constant for the [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) complex.

In that case, K1=β1=9,

K2=β2=40,

K3=β3=63,

K4=β4=16.

That would change the calculations. Because earlier, I assumed that K2 is β1 * β2, but perhaps in reality, K2 is given as 40.

If that's the case, then let's recalculate.

So, if the stability constants are K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16,

then the terms for each complex are:

m=0:1,

m=1: K1 [S] =9 *0.1=0.9,

m=2: K2 [S]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4,

m=3: K3 [S]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063,

m=4: K4 [S]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

Sum all terms:

1 +0.9=1.9,

+0.4=2.3,

+0.063=2.363,

+0.0016≈2.3646.

So, denominator sum is about 2.3646.

Then, the fractions:

f_0=1/2.3646 ≈0.423 →42.3%.

f_1=0.9/2.3646≈0.381 →38.1%.

f_2=0.4/2.3646≈0.169 →16.9%.

f_3=0.063/2.3646≈0.0266 →2.66%.

f_4=0.0016/2.3646≈0.000676 →0.0676%.

The sum:42.3 +38.1=80.4; +16.9=97.3; +2.66=99.96; +0.0676=100.027%. Approximately 100%.

Wait, in this case, the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is f_2. So, f_2 is approximately 16.9% (option D).

But wait, the question's options include 42.3% (option A), 38.1% (option C), etc. But in this scenario, the dithiocyanato (n=2) is 16.9%, which is option D. But earlier when I considered stepwise β, the fraction was about 5.5%, which isn't an option. So, perhaps in this problem, the given β are the overall K for each complex, not the stepwise constants.

But the problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16." Which typically, the stability constants are given as the overall K for each complex, not the stepwise ones. Wait, no, typically, the stepwise stability constants are given, especially for ligand addition.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused about the terminology. Let me clarify: the "stability constant" (β) for a complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from its ions. For a complex like [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}, the stability constant βn is the overall K for that complex. So, βn = [ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} ] / ( [Co²+][SCN⁻]^n )

So, in that case, the four β's are for n=1,2,3,4.

Which would mean that K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16.

Which is what I did in the second calculation, leading to f_2 being 16.9%, option D. But the options list D as 16.9%.

But wait, the calculated fractions when using the β as the overall K's are:

f_0≈42.3%, f_1≈38.1%, f_2≈16.9%, etc.

So, that would make the blue dithiocyanato complex (n=2) being 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the options are:

A) 42.3%

B)25.6%

C)38.1%

D)16.9%

So, option D is 16.9%, which is what I get for f_2 when using the β as the overall K's.

But that would be the correct approach. So, the answer should be D.

Wait, but why did I get 5.5% earlier when I considered the β as stepwise? Because I probably misunderstood the given β's. The problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, etc. So, assuming each β is the overall K for each complex.

Therefore, the correct calculation is the second approach, leading to f_2 being approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, in the first approach, the fractions summed to 100%, but the dithiocyanato was only about 5.5%, which isn't an option. So, the correct approach must be the second, which aligns with option D.

But wait, the problem's β3 is 63, which is higher than β2=40. So, the third complex is more stable than the second, but the fourth is less stable than the second.

Wait, but in the second approach, the fractions are dominated by f_0 (42.3%) and f_1 (38.1%). But that's because the denominator is 2.3646, which is small. So, the fractions are mostly the lower complexes.

But let me cross-check with the concentrations.

Wait, given that [SCN−] is 0.1 M, which is relatively low. So, higher-order complexes may not form as much.

Wait, when [SCN−] is low, the lower n complexes tend to dominate because higher n requires more ligand, which is less available.

In the second approach, f_0 is 42.3%, f_1 is 38.1%, f_2 is 16.9%, which seems a bit counterintuitive because the formation constants for higher n are higher.

Wait, because β3=63 is higher than β2=40, so [Co(SCN)_3]^- is more stable than [Co(SCN)_2]^0. But in the calculations, when [S] is 0.1, the contribution of K3 [S]^3 is 63*(0.1)^3=0.063, which is less than K2 [S]^2=40*(0.1)^2=0.4. So, perhaps even though K3 is higher than K2, the lower [S] means the term for n=3 is smaller than n=2.

So, in the denominator, the term for m=2 is 0.4, which is larger than m=3's 0.063.

So, the fraction f_2 is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, 16.9%, which is option D.

Thus, the correct answer is D) 16.9%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt complexes based on the given stability constants β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, and β₄=16. These constants represent the overall stability constants for the complexes [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}, where n is the number of SCN⁻ ligands.

The total cobalt concentration is given as 10⁻² M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The fractions of each cobalt species are calculated using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{K_n [SCN^-]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^4 K_m [SCN^-]^m}
\]

where \( K_n = \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \dots \beta_n \) for each complex. The denominator is the sum of all terms, including the free cobalt ion (\( m=0 \)).

### Step 1: Compute the overall formation constants \( K_n \)
- \( K_0 = 1 \) (free Co²⁺)
- \( K_1 = \beta_1 = 9 \)
- \( K_2 = \beta_1 \beta_2 = 9 \cdot 40 = 360 \)
- \( K_3 = \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 = 9 \cdot 40 \cdot 63 = 22680 \)
- \( K_4 = \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 = 9 \cdot 40 \cdot 63 \cdot 16 = 362880 \)

### Step 2: Compute each term in the denominator
The terms are calculated as:
- \( K_0 [SCN^-]^0 = 1 \)
- \( K_1 [SCN^-]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
- \( K_2 [SCN^-]^2 = 360 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 3.6 \)
- \( K_3 [SCN^-]^3 = 22680 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 22.68 \)
- \( K_4 [SCN^-]^4 = 362880 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 36.288 \)

Summing these terms gives the denominator:
\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 + 36.288 = 64.468
\]

### Step 3: Compute the fractions \( f_n \)
The fraction of each species is:
- \( f_0 = \frac{1}{64.468} \approx 0.0155 \) (1.55%)
- \( f_1 = \frac{0.9}{64.468} \approx 0.01396 \) (1.40%)
- \( f_2 = \frac{3.6}{64.468} \approx 0.05557 \) (5.56%)
- \( f_3 = \frac{22.68}{64.468} \approx 0.3518 \) (35.18%)
- \( f_4 = \frac{36.288}{64.468} \approx 0.5628 \) (56.28%)

### Step 4: Verify the sum of fractions
The total fraction sums to approximately 1:
\[
f_0 + f_1 + f_2 + f_3 + f_4 \approx 1.55\% + 1.40\% + 5.56\% + 35.18\% + 56.28\% = 100\%
\]

### Step 5: Identify the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex
The blue dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, corresponding to \( f_2 \). From the calculations:
\[
f_2 \approx 5.56\%
\]

### Step 6: Reassess the interpretation of β
The problem specifies that the given constants are "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes." This suggests that the β values are the overall stability constants for each complex, not the stepwise constants. Recomputing with this interpretation:

- \( K_1 = \beta_1 = 9 \)
- \( K_2 = \beta_2 = 40 \)
- \( K_3 = \beta_3 = 63 \)
- \( K_4 = \beta_4 = 16 \)

The terms in the denominator are:
- \( K_0 [SCN^-]^0 = 1 \)
- \( K_1 [SCN^-]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
- \( K_2 [SCN^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \)
- \( K_3 [SCN^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \)
- \( K_4 [SCN^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \)

Summing these terms gives the denominator:
\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

The fractions are:
- \( f_0 = \frac{1}{2.3646} \approx 0.423 \) (42.3%)
- \( f_1 = \frac{0.9}{2.3646} \approx 0.381 \) (38.1%)
- \( f_2 = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169 \) (16.9%)
- \( f_3 = \frac{0.063}{2.3646} \approx 0.0266 \) (2.66%)
- \( f_4 = \frac{0.0016}{2.3646} \approx 0.000676 \) (0.0676%)

The total fraction sums to approximately 1:
\[
f_0 + f_1 + f_2 + f_3 + f_4 \approx 42.3\% + 38.1\% + 16.9\% + 2.66\% + 0.0676\% = 100\%
\]

The blue dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, corresponds to \( f_2 \approx 16.9\% \).

### Final Answer
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option **D**.
