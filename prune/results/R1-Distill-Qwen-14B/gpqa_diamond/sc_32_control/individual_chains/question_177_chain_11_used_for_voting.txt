Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured the radial velocities as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question is about the luminosity of Star_1 compared to Star_2. The options are all factors by which Star_1 is more luminous.

Hmm, okay. So I'm supposed to assume the stars radiate as black bodies. I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times temperature to the fourth.

But wait, the problem says they found the same wavelengths where the stars appear brightest. Oh right, for a black body, the wavelength where the emission is maximum is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.8977719×10^-3 m·K). So if the wavelengths at maximum emission are the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. Wait, but wait, if λ_max is the same, then T must be the same? Because λ_max = b/T, so T = b/λ_max. So if λ_max is the same, T is the same for both stars. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but I thought Star_1 has a larger radius. So if R1 is 1.5 R2 and T1 = T2, then the luminosity of Star_1 should be (1.5)^2 times that of Star_2, because L is proportional to R² T⁴. Since T is the same, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would be option A) ~2.25.

But wait, the problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that affect anything? Oh, wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Because when a star moves towards us, the light is blueshifted, and when moving away, it's redshifted. So the observed wavelength would be different from the rest wavelength. But the question says the brightest wavelengths are the same. So perhaps the Doppler shift is already accounted for when they found the wavelengths. Hmm.

Wait, let me think. If a star is moving towards us, the wavelengths we observe are shorter than the rest wavelengths. If it's moving away, they're longer. But in the problem, they found that the λ_max for both stars is the same. So perhaps their actual (intrinsic) temperatures are different, but the observed λ_max for both stars is the same because of the Doppler effect. Oh wait, but the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ_max is shorter than its rest λ_max. Similarly, if it's moving away, it's longer. So perhaps the observed λ_max being the same leads us to infer their intrinsic temperatures.

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let me denote:

For Star_1: radial velocity v1 = 0. So observed λ_max is the same as the rest λ_max. So λ_max,1_observed = λ_max,1_rest.

For Star_2: radial velocity v2 = 700 km/s. So the observed λ_max is λ_max,2_rest * (1 + v2/c) or (1 - v2/c), depending on the direction. Wait, radial velocity of 700 km/s is away or towards? The problem says radial velocity of 700 km/s for Star_2. But radial velocity is usually given as positive when moving away, I think. So if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer.

Wait, I got the Doppler effect formula for wavelength: λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity (positive if moving away, negative if moving towards). So if Star_1 has v=0, λ_max1 = λ_max1_rest. Star_2 has v=700, so λ_max2_observed = λ_max2_rest * (1 + 700/(c)).

But the problem states that the observed λ_max for both stars are the same. So λ_max1 = λ_max2_observed.

So,

λ_max,1_rest = λ_max,2_rest * (1 + v2/c)

But since λ_max = b/(T), so λ_max,1_rest = b/(T1), λ_max,2_rest = b/(T2). So,

b/(T1) = (b/(T2)) * (1 + v2/c )

Divide both sides by b,

1/(T1) = (1/(T2)) (1 + v2/c )

Simplify,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c )

Hmm, so T1 is T2 divided by (1 + v2/c). Since v2 is 700 km/s, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light? Let's check. The speed of light is about 3e5 km/s. So 700 is 700 / 3e5 = approximately 0.002333, or 0.233%. So v2/c is small, so 1 + v2/c is approximately 1.002333.

So T1 ≈ T2 * (1 - v2/c ), because 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x when x is small. So approximately, T1 is T2 multiplied by (1 - v2/c).

Wait, but that would make T1 less than T2. So the temperature of Star_1 is lower than that of Star_2. But earlier, without considering velocity, I thought T1=T2 because λ_max is same. But now, considering that Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ_max is longer than its rest λ_max. So for the observed λ_max to be same as Star_1, Star_1's λ_max must be equal to Star_2's λ_max multiplied by (1 + v2/c). So T1 is lower than T2.

So, now, the luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 (T1/T2)^4.

We have R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1/R2 = 1.5.

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c ) ≈ T2 (1 - v2/c )

So T1/T2 ≈ 1 - (700e3 m/s)/(3e8 m/s) = 1 - (7e5)/(3e8) = 1 - (7/(300)) ≈ 1 - 0.02333 ≈ 0.97667.

So T1/T2 ≈ 0.97667.

So (T1/T2)^4 is (0.97667)^4.

Let me calculate that. 0.97667^4.

First, calculate 0.97667 squared: 0.97667 * 0.97667.

Let me approximate:

0.97667 ≈ 0.9767.

(0.9767)^2: 0.9767 * 0.9767.

Let me compute:

0.9767 * 0.9767 = (0.9767)^2.

I can compute this as (1 - 0.0233)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.0233 + (0.0233)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0466 + 0.000543 ≈ 0.954.

Wait, but let me get more precise.

Alternatively, use calculator approach:

0.9767 * 0.9767:

Compute 9767 * 9767.

Wait, that's tedious. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 0.9767^2 as follows:

Compute 0.9767 * 0.9767:

= (1 - 0.0233) * (1 - 0.0233)
= 1 - 2*0.0233 + (0.0233)^2
= 1 - 0.0466 + 0.00054289
= 0.95394289.

Wait, but wait, 0.0233^2 is (0.0233)^2 = 0.00054289.

So, the square is approximately 0.95394.

Then, (0.95394) squared to find the fourth power.

So, (0.95394)^2.

Again, approximate:

0.95394^2 ≈ (0.95)^2 + correction.

0.95^2=0.9025. 0.95394 is 0.95 + 0.00394.

So,

(0.95 + 0.00394)^2 = (0.95)^2 + 2*(0.95)*(0.00394) + (0.00394)^2.

Calculate each term:

0.95^2 = 0.9025.

2*(0.95)*(0.00394) = 2 * 0.95 * 0.00394 = 1.9 * 0.00394 ≈ 0.007486.

(0.00394)^2 ≈ 0.0000155.

Adding all terms: 0.9025 + 0.007486 ≈ 0.91, plus 0.0000155 is 0.9100155.

So approximately 0.91.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.91.

So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 0.91.

(1.5)^2 is 2.25. 2.25 * 0.91.

2.25 * 0.9 = 2.025, 2.25 * 0.01 = 0.0225. So 2.025 +0.0225= 2.0475. But wait, 0.91 is 0.9 +0.01, so 2.25 * 0.9 = 2.025, and 2.25 *0.01=0.0225. So total 2.0475.

Wait, but I think my approximation might be a bit rough. Maybe I should calculate (0.97667)^4 more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute T1/T2 exactly.

v2 = 700 km/s.

v2 in m/s: 700,000 m/s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

So v2/c = 700e3 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.0233333.

So 1 + v2/c = 1.023333.

So T1 = T2 / 1.023333.

So T1 = T2 * (1 / 1.023333) ≈ T2 * 0.9766.

So T1 / T2 ≈ 0.9766.

So (T1 / T2)^4 = (0.9766)^4.

Let me compute it in a better way. Let's take natural logs.

ln(0.9766) ≈ -0.0237.

So ln(0.9766^4) = 4*(-0.0237) = -0.0948.

Exponentiate: e^(-0.0948) ≈ 1 - 0.0948 + (0.0948)^2/2 - ... . Let's approximate:

e^(-0.0948) ≈ 0.909.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.909.

So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 0.909 = 2.25 * 0.909 ≈ 2.04225.

Wait, but that's around 2.04, but the options are about 2.23, 2.25, 2.32, etc.

Hmm, this suggests that the luminosity ratio is about 2.04, but none of the options are near that. So perhaps my approach is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering the Doppler shift.

Wait, wait a second. Let me think again. The problem states that the stars appeared brightest at the same wavelength. So when we observe Star_2, which is moving away at 700 km/s, its observed λ_max is longer than its rest λ_max. So for the observed λ_max to be the same as Star_1's, which has a rest λ_max, Star_1's rest λ_max must be equal to Star_2's observed λ_max.

Wait, that's correct.

So, λ_max,1_rest = λ_max,2_observed.

And λ_max,2_observed = λ_max,2_rest * (1 + v2/c), because when moving away, the wavelength is longer.

So, λ_max,1_rest = λ_max,2_rest * (1 + v2/c).

But λ_max,rest is given by Wien's law: λ = b/T. So,

(b/T1) = (b/T2) * (1 + v2/c )

Divide both sides by b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c )

=> T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c )

So T1 = T2 * [1 / (1 + v2/c ) ].

Which, using the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x,

T1 ≈ T2 (1 - v2/c )

So, T1 is approximately T2 (1 - 700e3/3e8) = T2 (1 - 0.023333) ≈ 0.97667 T2.

So, back to the luminosity calculation.

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4.

So, L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4) = (1.5)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

We have T1/T2 = 0.97667.

So (0.97667)^4 ≈ let's compute it accurately.

Compute 0.97667^4.

Compute:

0.97667^2: let's compute 97667 * 97667.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 0.97667 * 0.97667.

Let me compute it step by step:

0.97667 * 0.97667:

= (0.97 + 0.00667) * (0.97 + 0.00667)

= 0.97^2 + 2*0.97*0.00667 + (0.00667)^2.

0.97² = 0.9409.

2 * 0.97 * 0.00667 = 2 * 0.97 * 0.00667 ≈ 0.01307.

(0.00667)^2 ≈ 0.000044.

Adding them up: 0.9409 + 0.01307 ≈ 0.95397. Plus 0.000044 gives 0.95397 + 0.000044 ≈ 0.954014.

So (0.97667)^2 ≈ 0.954014.

Now, square this again to get to the fourth power.

So 0.954014 squared.

= (0.95 + 0.004014)^2

= 0.95^2 + 2 * 0.95 * 0.004014 + (0.004014)^2.

0.95^2 = 0.9025.

2 * 0.95 * 0.004014 = 1.9 * 0.004014 ≈ 0.0076266.

(0.004014)^2 ≈ 0.00001611.

Adding all together: 0.9025 + 0.0076266 = 0.9101266, plus 0.00001611 gives 0.9101427.

So approximately 0.91014.

So (0.97667)^4 ≈ 0.91014.

So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 0.91014 = 2.25 * 0.91014 ≈ 2.25 * 0.91.

2.25 * 0.9 = 2.025, and 2.25 * 0.01 = 0.0225. So 2.025 + 0.0225 = 2.0475.

Wait, so approximately 2.0475.

But the options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Hmm, none of these are around 2.04. So maybe I made a mistake. Let me go back.

Wait a minute, perhaps I messed up the Doppler shift formula. The Doppler effect for wavelength is λ' = λ * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) when v << c, but wait, no. Wait, the relativistic Doppler effect formula is λ' = λ * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) when v is a significant fraction of c. But for v << c, λ' ≈ λ (1 + v/c). So I think the linear approximation is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem states that the stars appeared brightest at the same wavelength. So the observed maximum emission is at the same wavelength for both. So Star_1's intrinsic λ_max is λ1, Star_2's intrinsic λ_max is λ2. But due to Star_2's velocity, its observed λ_max is λ2 * (1 + v2/c) if moving away.

But for the observed λ_max to be same as Star_1's, which is λ1_observed = λ1_rest (since v1=0).

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c )

So, λ1 = λ2 * (1 + v2/c )

But λ is inversely proportional to temperature. So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v2/c )

So, 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c )

So, T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c )

Hmm, same as before. So perhaps my calculation is correct, but the options don't include 2.04. So maybe I did something wrong here.

Wait, could the problem involve the Doppler shift affecting the observed flux or something else? Or perhaps the radial velocity affects the observed luminosity?

Wait, another thought: the Doppler effect might cause a shift in the observed wavelength, but when calculating the luminosity, which is intrinsic, we don't consider the Doppler shift. Because the luminosity is an intrinsic property, not dependent on the observer's frame. So perhaps I should ignore the Doppler effect when calculating luminosity. But wait, the problem states that the observed λ_max are the same. So the Doppler shift comes into play because Star_2's intrinsic λ_max is different from what it appears due to its motion.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the temperatures after considering the Doppler effect. Because for the observed λ_max to be same, Star_1's intrinsic λ_max must be shorter than Star_2's intrinsic λ_max, because Star_2 is moving away, making its observed λ_max longer than its intrinsic.

Wait, let's make this clear. Star_1: v=0, so observed λ_max = λ1_rest.

Star_2: v=700 km/s away, so observed λ_max = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c).

We have λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c).

Because λ1_obs = λ1_rest = λ2_obs = λ2_rest*(1 +v/c).

Wait, no. Because the observed λ_max for both stars is the same, so λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c).

So, λ1 = λ2 * (1 + v/c )

But since λ is inversely proportional to T, λ1 = b/T1, λ2 = b/T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v/c )

=> 1/T1 = (1 + v/c ) / T2

=> T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c )

Which is again T1 ≈ T2 (1 - v/c ), when v/c is small.

So, same result as before.

Hmm, but then the luminosity ratio is 2.25 * (0.97667)^4 ≈ 2.25 * 0.91014 ≈ 2.047.

Which is about 2.05. But the options are A) 2.25, B) 2.32, etc. So none of the options match.

Wait another thought. Could I have messed up the Doppler shift formula? Because sometimes, the relativistic Doppler effect for wavelength is given differently. Let me check.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

λ' = λ * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) when the source is moving away.

Wait, but that's when v is a significant fraction of c. In our case, v=700 km/s, which is about 0.0023c. So the approximation λ' ≈ λ (1 + v/c ) is valid.

So, I think my initial approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps the radial velocities are in different directions. Like, Star_1 is moving towards us, and Star_2 is moving away. But the problem says Star_1 has radial velocity 0. So maybe Star_2 is moving away at 700, so λ_observed is longer.

But in any case, the approach should be the same.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact (T1/T2)^4 term without approximation.

So, let's compute (0.97667)^4 exactly as possible.

We can compute it step by step.

Compute 0.97667^2:

0.97667 * 0.97667.

Let me compute it as 97667 * 97667, but that's time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator-like approach.

Wait, 0.97667 is approximately 0.97667.

Compute 0.97667 * 0.97667:

Let me compute 0.97 * 0.97 = 0.9409.

0.97 * 0.00667 = approximately 0.00647.

0.00667 * 0.97 = same as above.

And 0.00667 * 0.00667 = 0.000044.

But wait, that's not the right approach. Wait, perhaps I can compute 0.97667 * 0.97667.

Wait, 0.97667 × 0.97667:

= (0.9 + 0.07 + 0.00667) × (0.9 + 0.07 + 0.00667)

But that's complicated. Alternatively, let's compute it precisely:

0.97667 × 0.97667.

Let me write it as (0.9 + 0.07 + 0.00667) × same.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as 0.97667 is approximately 0.976666... which is 976666...e-6. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use exact multiplication:

Compute 0.97667 × 0.97667.

Break it down:

0.97667 × 0.97667 = ?

Let me compute 97667 × 97667.

Wait, 97667 × 97667 = ?

Well, 97667 × 97667.

Compute 97667 × 97667:

Let me compute 97667 × 97667 = ?

Perhaps using the formula (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b², where a=97660, b=7.

So,

(97660 +7)^2 = 97660² + 2 *97660 *7 +7².

Compute each term:

97660² = (9766 × 10)^2 = 9766² × 100.

Hmm, perhaps that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 97667 × 97667 as approximately 9539711289. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can just proceed with the calculation, knowing that precise numbers may not be necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just proceed with the calculation using exact fractions.

Wait, v = 700 km/s. So v/c = 700,000 m/s / 300,000,000 m/s = 700/(3e5) = 7/(300) ≈ 0.02333333.

So 1 + v/c = 1.02333333.

Thus, T1 = T2 / 1.02333333 ≈ 0.976666667 T2.

So, T1/T2 = 0.976666667.

So, (T1/T2)^4 = (0.976666667)^4.

Let me compute that using a calculator approach:

Compute 0.976666667 squared:

0.976666667^2 = (976666.667e-6)^2 = ?

Alternatively, compute 0.976666667 * 0.976666667.

0.976666667 × 0.976666667 ≈ 0.95397.

Then, square that result: 0.95397^2 ≈ 0.91014.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.91014.

So, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 0.91014 = 2.25 * 0.91014 ≈ 2.25 * 0.91014.

Compute 2.25 × 0.91014.

2 * 0.91014 = 1.82028.

0.25 × 0.91014 = 0.227535.

Adding together: 1.82028 + 0.227535 = 2.047815.

So approximately 2.0478, which is about 2.05.

But the options are around 2.23, 2.25, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (T1/T2)^4.

Wait, let me compute 0.976666667^4 using logarithms.

ln(0.976666667) ≈ -0.02373.

So, ln( (0.976666667)^4 ) = 4 * (-0.02373) = -0.09492.

Now, e^(-0.09492) ≈ ?

We know that e^(-0.09) ≈ 0.9139.

e^(-0.09492) = ?

The difference between -0.09 and -0.09492 is a delta of -0.00492.

So, using the Taylor expansion around x= -0.09:

e^{x + dx} ≈ e^x * (1 + dx).

So,

e^(-0.09492) ≈ e^(-0.09) * e^(-0.00492)

e^(-0.09) ≈ 0.9139.

e^(-0.00492) ≈ 1 - 0.00492 + (0.00492)^2/2 ≈ 0.99508 + 0.000012 ≈ 0.99509.

So,

0.9139 * 0.99509 ≈ 0.9139 * 0.995 = 0.9139 * (1 - 0.005) = 0.9139 - 0.0045695 ≈ 0.90933.

So, e^(-0.09492) ≈ 0.90933.

So, (T1/T2)^4 = 0.90933.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.90933 ≈ 2.25 * 0.90933.

2.25 * 0.9 = 2.025.

2.25 * 0.00933 ≈ 0.021.

Adding, 2.025 + 0.021 = 2.046.

Again, around 2.046.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the Doppler effect is being applied in a different way, such as for flux?

Wait, what's the flux? The flux from a star is the energy per unit area per unit time. But the problem is about luminosity, which is the total energy emitted per unit time.

Wait, if Star_2 is moving away, the observed flux would be less, but luminosity is an intrinsic property. So perhaps the Doppler effect affects the observed flux but not the intrinsic luminosity.

Wait, that's correct. The Doppler effect affects the observed wavelength and the observed flux, but the intrinsic luminosity is unaffected by the star's motion. So, perhaps despite the Doppler shift, the luminosity is still L = 4π R² σ T⁴, with T being the intrinsic temperature.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the observed λ_max being the same leads us to find T1 = T2 * (1 + v2/c )^{-1}.

But perhaps that's incorrect. Because if the observed λ_max is the same for both stars, then the observed temperatures would be the same, but their intrinsic temperatures could be different.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing intrinsic and observed quantities.

Let me clarify:

Each star emits a spectrum with a certain T. The observed spectrum of Star_2 is shifted due to the Doppler effect. So the observed λ_max for Star_2 is longer than its intrinsic λ_max. But the observed λ_max for Star_1 is the same as its intrinsic λ_max because Star_1 is not moving.

The problem states that the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So, λ_max, observed for Star_1 = λ_max, observed for Star_2.

But λ_max, observed for Star_1 is λ_max,rest for Star_1. λ_max, observed for Star_2 is λ_max,rest for Star_2 multiplied by (1 + v/c).

So,

λ_max,1_rest = λ_max,2_rest * (1 + v/c )

Which gives:

T1 = T2 / (1 +v/c )

Hence, T1 = T2 * [1/(1 +v/c ) ] ≈ T2 (1 - v/c )

So, back to the same calculation.

Hmm, then the calculation should still yield L1/L2 ≈ 2.047, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem does not account for the Doppler effect in the temperature. Maybe the problem considers the stars' rest frames, so the observed λ_max is not the same as the rest λ_max. Wait, but the problem states that the stars appeared brightest at the same wavelengths, which would be the observed wavelengths.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem differently. Maybe since both stars have the same observed λ_max, their observed temperatures are the same, but their intrinsic temperatures are different. Because the Doppler effect could cause a star to have a different intrinsic temperature but same observed emission peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simpler, and the Doppler effect isn't a factor in the luminosity calculation because the luminosity is an intrinsic property. So without considering the Doppler effect, we have R1 = 1.5 R2, T1 = T2 (since λ_max is same when considering observed), so L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, which is option A. But earlier, I thought that the observed λ_max being same would imply T1 = T2, but according to the Doppler effect, that's not the case.

Wait, but perhaps the problem assumes that the stars' rest wavelengths are the same, and the Doppler effect shifts them. But the problem says they appear brightest at the same observed wavelength. So perhaps T1 and T2 are same, but their observed wavelengths are same because of their velocities.

Wait, that can't be, because if their rest wavelengths are same, then for Star_2, which is moving away, the observed wavelength would be longer. So the only way for the observed wavelengths to be same is if T1 is lower than T2.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the options again. The options are all around 2.23 to 2.35, which suggests that the factor is around 2.24 or 2.32.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler shift is considered in the way that the intrinsic temperature of Star_2 is higher than that of Star_1 because it's moving away, so the observed λ_max for both is same.

Wait, perhaps the observed temperature is same.

Because λ_max is same, the observed temperatures T_obs are same.

But the intrinsic temperatures are different.

But for each star, observed T_obs = T_rest * (1 - v/c ), if it's moving away. Wait, no, the Doppler shift affects the wavelength and the frequency.

Wait, the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c ), for v away.

The observed temperature could be found from λ_obs.

Wien's law says λ_obs = b / T_obs.

So,

T_obs = b / λ_obs.

But λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c ) when moving away.

And λ_rest = b / T_rest.

So,

λ_obs = (b / T_rest) * (1 + v/c )

Thus,

T_obs = b / [ (b/T_rest) * (1 + v/c ) ] = T_rest / (1 + v/c )

So, for Star_2, T_obs = T2_rest / (1 + v2/c )

Similarly, Star_1's T_obs = T1_rest.

But the problem states that the observed λ_max are same, so their observed temperatures are same.

Thus,

T_obs,1 = T_obs,2.

So,

T1_rest = T2_rest / (1 + v2/c )

Which brings us back to the same conclusion.

Hmm.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the luminosity using the intrinsic T. Which would be T1 = T2_rest / (1 + v2/c )

But I'm not sure. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the Doppler effect, and just compute the luminosity ratio based on R and T being the same, which would be 2.25.

But why would the problem mention the radial velocities then? That suggests that the Doppler effect is relevant.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the stars' actual temperatures are same, but due to Doppler shift, their observed temperatures are different, but the problem says they appear brightest at the same wavelength, which would imply their observed temperatures are same, which would require T1_rest = T2_rest * (1 + v2/c )

Wait, but this seems similar to earlier approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler.

Wait, let's think again.

The problem says that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. So, for each star, the peak emission is at λ_max, which is observed.

So, for Star_1: λ_max1_obs = λ_max1_rest.

For Star_2: λ_max2_obs = λ_max2_rest * (1 + v2/c )

And λ_max1_obs = λ_max2_obs.

So,

λ_max1_rest = λ_max2_rest * (1 + v2/c )

But since λ_max_rest = b / T_rest,

lambda1_rest = (b / T1_rest) = (b / T2_rest) * (1 + v2/c )

Thus,

T1_rest = T2_rest / (1 + v2/c )

So, T1_rest = T2_rest * [1 / (1 + 0.023333) ] ≈ T2_rest * 0.97667.

So, T1_rest = 0.97667 * T2_rest.

So,

L1 = 4π R1^2 σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2^2 σ T2^4.

Ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

R1/R2 = 1.5, so (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T1/T2 = 0.97667.

So,

(0.97667)^4 ≈ 0.91014.

Then,

2.25 * 0.91014 ≈ 2.25 * 0.91 = 2.0475.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the given options are wrong, or I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate (0.97667)^4 more accurately.

Compute 0.97667^4.

Let me compute step by step.

Compute 0.97667^2:

0.97667 * 0.97667.

Let me compute 97667 * 97667.

But I think it's easier to compute 0.97667 * 0.97667 = (0.97 + 0.00667)^2.

= 0.97^2 + 2*(0.97)*(0.00667) + 0.00667^2.

0.97^2 = 0.9409.

2*0.97*0.00667 ≈ 2 * 0.97 * 0.00667 = 1.94 * 0.00667 ≈ 0.0129798.

0.00667^2 ≈ 0.0000444889.

So sum: 0.9409 + 0.0129798 = 0.9538798 + 0.0000444889 ≈ 0.9539243.

So, 0.97667^2 ≈ 0.9539243.

Now, compute 0.9539243^2.

= (0.95 + 0.0039243)^2

= 0.95^2 + 2*0.95*0.0039243 + (0.0039243)^2.

0.95^2 = 0.9025.

2*0.95*0.0039243 ≈ 1.9 * 0.0039243 ≈ 0.007456.

(0.0039243)^2 ≈ 0.00001539.

Adding these: 0.9025 + 0.007456 = 0.91, plus 0.00001539 gives 0.91001539.

So, 0.9539243^2 ≈ 0.910015.

Therefore, (0.97667)^4 ≈ 0.910015.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.910015 ≈ 2.25 * 0.910015 ≈ 2.0475.

Hmm, so approximately 2.0475.

The options given don't have this. The closest option is A) ~2.25, which is when Doppler effect is not considered. So perhaps the problem expects the Doppler effect not to be considered, and just calculate L1/L2 as (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

But the question mentions the Doppler velocities, which suggests that it should affect the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the observed maximum emission is at the same wavelength, so the observed wavelengths are same, but the intrinsic T1 and T2 are same. Because the Doppler effect would then cause their observed T to be same.

Wait, but if the observed T is same, then T_obs = T1_rest = T2_rest.

But how does that work with the Doppler shift?

Wait, if the observed λ_max is same, then T_obs = T1 = T2.

But according to the Doppler effect, for Star_2, T_obs = T2_rest / (1 +v/c )

So, T_obs = T2_rest / 1.023333 ≈ 0.97667 T2_rest.

If T_obs must be same as T1_rest, then T1_rest = T_obs = 0.97667 T2_rest.

So T1_rest = 0.97667 T2_rest.

So, the same as before.

So, I'm stuck. The calculation leads me to about 2.0475, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to ignore the Doppler effect, so the answer is 2.25, option A. But why would the problem include the Doppler velocities then?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that the stars have the same luminosity, but that's not the case. The question says compute the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers that the observed flux is the same, but that's not stated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the wavelengths at which they emit are the same in their rest frames. But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are same.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't require considering the Doppler effect on temperature, and just assumes T1 = T2, leading to L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

But that would ignore the fact that the observed λ_max are same, which only occurs if T1 and T2 are different.

So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the options again.

Option D is ~2.23, which is close to 2.25. But why would it be 2.23?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (T1/T2)^4.

Let me compute (0.97667)^4 more accurately.

We have:

0.97667^2 = 0.9539243.

Then, 0.9539243^2.

Compute 0.9539243 × 0.9539243.

Let me do it more accurately.

0.9539243 × 0.9539243:

Let me compute it step by step.

Multiply 0.9539243 by 0.9539243.

Break it into parts:

= 0.95 * 0.95 + 0.95 * 0.0039243 + 0.0039243 * 0.95 + 0.0039243^2.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps use a binomial expansion.

Let me consider 0.9539243 = 0.95 + 0.0039243.

So,

(0.95 + 0.0039243)^2 = 0.95^2 + 2*0.95*0.0039243 + (0.0039243)^2.

Compute each term:

0.95^2 = 0.9025.

2*0.95*0.0039243 = 1.9 * 0.0039243 ≈ 0.007456.

(0.0039243)^2 ≈ 0.00001539.

Adding them gives 0.9025 + 0.007456 = 0.91, plus 0.00001539 gives 0.91001539.

So, 0.9539243^2 ≈ 0.91001539.

Thus, (0.97667)^4 ≈ 0.910015.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.910015 ≈ 2.0475.

Hmm, that's about 2.0475, which isn't any of the options.

But perhaps I should consider that the Doppler shift is approximated differently.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects the Doppler shift to be considered in the observed luminosity, but I don't think that makes sense because luminosity is intrinsic.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the Doppler effect to be used to find the actual temperatures, but I'm not seeing how.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength, which is the same as saying that their observed λ_max are same. So, as before, T_obs = same for both.

But for Star_2, T_obs = T2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c ) / (1 + v/c ) ), due to relativistic Doppler effect.

Wait, I think I might have been incorrect in the earlier Doppler shift formula.

The correct relativistic Doppler shift for wavelength is λ' = λ * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), when moving away.

Wait, but for small v, this is approximately λ (1 + v/c ).

However, for temperature, which is inversely proportional to wavelength, the observed temperature T_obs is given by T_obs = T_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c ) )

Which for small v, is approximately T_rest * (1 - v/c )

Thus,

T_obs,2 = T2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c )/(1 + v/c ) )

But since v is small,

sqrt( (1 - v/c )/(1 + v/c ) ) ≈ 1 - v/c.

So,

T_obs,2 ≈ T2_rest (1 - v/c )

Similarly, for Star_1, T_obs,1 = T1_rest.

Since T_obs,1 = T_obs,2,

T1_rest = T2_rest (1 - v/c )

Which is the same as earlier.

So, T1_rest = 0.97667 T2_rest.

Thus, the same as before.

So, perhaps the correct calculation is around 2.0475, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the Doppler shift on the flux, but that's unrelated to luminosity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler effect, leading to L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, option A.

But why then the question includes the radial velocities?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem says that the stars have the same observed luminosity, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the correct answer is option D) ~2.23, which is close to 2.25 * (0.95)^4.

Wait, (0.95)^4 = 0.81450625.

2.25 * 0.8145 ≈ 1.8334. No, that's not helpful.

Wait, another thought. Perhaps I made a mistake in the T1 and T2 relationship.

Wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So, observed λ_max for both stars is the same. Thus, T_obs = same for both.

But T_obs relates to the rest frame as follows:

For Star_1, which is not moving, T_obs,1 = T_rest,1.

For Star_2, which is moving away with velocity v2, T_obs,2 = T_rest,2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

Set T_obs,1 = T_obs,2.

Thus,

T_rest,1 = T_rest,2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c ) / (1 + v2/c ) )

Thus,

T_rest,1 = T_rest,2 * sqrt( (1 - 0.023333 ) / (1 + 0.023333 ) )

Compute sqrt( (0.976667 ) / (1.023333 ) )

Compute 0.976667 / 1.023333 ≈ 0.954.

sqrt(0.954) ≈ 0.9767.

So,

T_rest,1 ≈ 0.9767 T_rest,2.

Wait, same as before.

So, the same calculation applies.

Hmm.

So, perhaps the intended answer is option D) ~2.23, which is close to 2.25 * 0.975, but I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the Doppler effect to be applied only to the observed flux, but not to the temperature.

But I'm stuck. Perhaps I should go with the calculation I did, which is around 2.05, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question asks for the inverse ratio, L2/L1, instead of L1/L2.

Wait, the question says, "the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So, it's L1/L2. So if my calculation is 2.0475, but the options don't match, perhaps the problem expects option D) ~2.23, which is roughly (1.5)^2 * (0.98)^4.

Alternatively, perhaps the approximation is more precise.

Wait, let's compute (0.97667)^4 precisely.

Compute 0.97667^4.

Let me use a calculator approach. Let's compute it step by step.

Compute 0.97667^2 = 0.9539243, as before.

Now, compute 0.9539243^2.

Compute 0.9539243 × 0.9539243.

Let me compute it more accurately.

0.9539243 × 0.9539243.

Break into parts:

= (0.9 + 0.05 + 0.0039243) × (0.9 + 0.05 + 0.0039243)

= 0.9*0.9 + 0.9*0.05 + 0.9*0.0039243 + 0.05*0.9 + 0.05*0.05 + 0.05*0.0039243 + 0.0039243*0.9 + 0.0039243*0.05 + 0.0039243^2.

But that's tedious. Alternatively, perhaps compute it as:

0.9539243 × 0.9539243.

= (0.9539243)^2.

We can compute this by noting that 0.9539243 is approximately 0.953924.

So, 0.953924 × 0.953924.

Calculate:

= (0.95 + 0.003924)^2.

= 0.95^2 + 2*0.95*0.003924 + (0.003924)^2.

= 0.9025 + 2 * 0.95 * 0.003924 + 0.00001539.

= 0.9025 + 0.0074556 + 0.00001539.

= 0.90997099.

So, (0.9539243)^2 ≈ 0.909971.

So, (0.97667)^4 ≈ 0.909971.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 × 0.909971 ≈ 2.04743.

Hmm, same as before.

Given that the options are all higher, perhaps the intended answer is A) ~2.25, ignoring the Doppler effect. But why would the problem mention the velocities then?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to have the stars emit at the same observed wavelength, but without considering the Doppler effect on temperature. So, T1 = T2, and L1/L2 = 2.25.

But that would be option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to have the same observed temperatures, which would require T_obs,1 = T_obs,2. But in that case, the intrinsic temperatures would be same, leading to L1/L2 = 2.25.

But I'm not sure.

In any case, based on the calculations, the factor should be approximately 2.047. Since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option D) ~2.23, but I can't see why.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the Doppler shift to affect the luminosity. Hmm, but luminosity is independent of the observer's frame.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the observed flux, which would be affected by the Doppler shift.

Flux F is given by F = L/(4πd²), but also, due to Doppler shift, F is affected.

Wait, no, because flux depends on the star's luminosity and distance. But if both stars are at the same distance, then the flux ratio would be the same as luminosity ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the observed flux from each star is affected by the Doppler shift. The flux is energy per unit area per unit time, and the Doppler shift affects the energy because the photons are being redshifted or blueshifted.

Wait, the flux observed would be F = F0 * (1 + v/c ), where F0 is the rest frame flux. Because, when a star is moving away, the photons are redshifted, so their energy is lower, and the number of photons received per unit time is lower. So, F_obs = F_rest * (1 + v/c )^{-1}.

Wait, no, the flux is also affected by the (1 + v/c ) factor because of the time dilation. So, perhaps F_obs = F_rest * (1 + v/c )^{-1}.

Alternatively, the observed flux F is related to the rest flux F0 by F = F0 * (1 + v/c )^{-1}.

So, if Star_2 is moving away, its observed flux would be lower.

But the problem doesn't mention flux; it's about luminosity. So perhaps this doesn't apply.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. Based on the calculation, the correct factor is approximately 2.047, but that's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option D) ~2.23, but I don't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (0.97667)^4.

Wait, let me compute (0.97667)^4 using a calculator.

0.97667^2 = 0.9539243.

0.9539243^2 = (0.9539243)^2.

Let me compute this using a calculator-like method.

Compute 0.9539243 × 0.9539243.

= (0.95 × 1000000 + 39243) × (0.95 × 1000000 + 39243) / 1e12.

Wait, this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute it using logarithms.

ln(0.97667) ≈ -0.02373.

Thus, ln( (0.97667)^4 ) = 4 * (-0.02373) = -0.09492.

e^{-0.09492} ≈ 0.9093.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9093 ≈ 2.0459.

Again, around 2.046.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option D) ~2.23.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the Doppler shift doesn't affect the temperature, thus L1/L2 = 2.25, option A.

But then why mention the Doppler velocities?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift application. Maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, perhaps I should compute T1 = T2 * (1 + v/c ), but that would mean T1 is higher.

Wait, if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ_max is longer, implying lower temperature. So for the observed λ_max to be same as Star_1, which isn't moving, Star_1's intrinsic temperature must be lower than Star_2's.

Wait, no, because if Star_2's observed λ_max is longer, then its observed temperature is lower. But since both have the same observed λ_max, their observed temperatures are same. So Star_1's intrinsic temperature must be same as Star_2's intrinsic temperature? No, because Star_2's observed temperature is lower.

Wait, I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should give up and select the closest option, which would be option D) ~2.23, but I don't know.

Wait, another approach. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the luminosity ratio based on the observed flux, which would be affected by the Doppler shift.

Wait, the observed flux from each star would be F1 and F2.

Luminosity is L = 4π d² F.

Assuming both stars are at the same distance, d.

But then, the flux from a star also depends on the Doppler shift.

The observed flux F_obs is given by F_obs = F_rest * (1 + v/c )^{-1}.

Because when a star moves away, the flux decreases as the photons are redshifted and fewer arrive per second.

So, F_obs = F_rest / (1 + v/c )

Thus, the observed flux from Star_2 is F2_obs = F2_rest / (1 + v2/c )

Similarly, F1_obs = F1_rest.

But the problem doesn't mention flux. It's about luminosity.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to compute the luminosity based on the observed wavelength, which would involve the Doppler shift.

Wait, but luminosity is an intrinsic property. So I'm not sure.

In conclusion, I'm not confident in the calculation, but based on the given options and the correct application of the Doppler effect, the luminosity ratio is approximately 2.0475, which isn't an option. However, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler effect and answer option A (2.25), or perhaps option D is the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere, and the correct ratio is around 2.23.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (0.97667)^4 more accurately.

0.97667 = approximately 0.9766666667.

Compute (0.9766666667)^4:

Compute step by step:

0.9766666667^2 = (976666.6667e-6)^2.

But perhaps more accurately, let's compute it using a calculator.

0.9766666667^2 = 0.953924264.

Then, 0.953924264^2 = (0.953924264)^2.

Compute 0.953924264 × 0.953924264.

Break it into parts:

0.953924264 × 0.953924264 = ?

Let me compute 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025.

0.95 * 0.003924264 = 0.00372796.

0.003924264 * 0.95 = 0.00372796.

0.003924264^2 ≈ 0.000015396.

So sum:

0.9025 + 0.00372796 + 0.00372796 + 0.000015396.

= 0.9025 + 0.00745592 + 0.000015396.

= 0.909971316.

So, (0.9766666667)^4 = 0.909971316.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.909971316 ≈ 2.04743.

Again, same result.

I think I have to conclude that the correct answer isn't among the options. But since I have to choose, perhaps the intended answer is option D) ~2.23, but I can't see why.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the Doppler effect to be applied in a different way, such as considering the Doppler shift leads to an increase in the observed luminosity, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the correct answer is 2.25, option A.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the observed wavelengths are same, so the intrinsic temperatures are same, leading to L1/L2 = 2.25.

But in that case, the Doppler effect is irrelevant, which contradicts the problem statement.

In conclusion, after much thought, I think the intended answer is option D) ~2.23, but I'm not sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the luminosity ratio \( L_1 / L_2 \) for two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies. The key parameters provided are:

- **Star_1**: Radius \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), mass \( M_1 = 1.5 M_2 \), radial velocity \( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s} \).
- **Star_2**: Radius \( R_2 \), mass \( M_2 \), radial velocity \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \).
- Both stars appear brightest at the same observed wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{max, obs}} \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Luminosity Formula**: The luminosity of a star is given by \( L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \), where \( R \) is the radius and \( T \) is the temperature. The ratio of luminosities is:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \right)^2 \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4
   \]
   Since \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), the radius factor is \( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \).

2. **Temperature Relationship**: The problem states that the stars appear brightest at the same observed wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{max, obs}} \). Using Wien's law, \( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} \), where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant, the observed wavelength is related to the intrinsic temperature by the Doppler effect:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{max, obs}} = \lambda_{\text{max, rest}} \cdot (1 + v/c)
   \]
   For Star_1 (\( v_1 = 0 \)), \( \lambda_{\text{max, obs, 1}} = \lambda_{\text{max, rest, 1}} \). For Star_2 (\( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)), \( \lambda_{\text{max, obs, 2}} = \lambda_{\text{max, rest, 2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c) \). Since \( \lambda_{\text{max, obs, 1}} = \lambda_{\text{max, obs, 2}} \), it follows that:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{max, rest, 1}} = \lambda_{\text{max, rest, 2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
   \]
   Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} \), we find:
   \[
   T_1 = \frac{T_2}{1 + v_2/c}
   \]
   For \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \), \( v_2/c \approx 0.00233 \). Thus:
   \[
   T_1 \approx T_2 \cdot (1 - v_2/c) \approx 0.97667 T_2
   \]

3. **Temperature Factor**: Substituting \( T_1 / T_2 \approx 0.97667 \) into the luminosity ratio:
   \[
   \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4 = (0.97667)^4
   \]
   Computing \( (0.97667)^4 \):
   \[
   (0.97667)^2 \approx 0.953924, \quad (0.953924)^2 \approx 0.910015
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4 \approx 0.910015
   \]

4. **Final Luminosity Ratio**: Combining the radius and temperature factors:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.910015 \approx 2.0475
   \]

### Conclusion:
The calculated luminosity ratio \( L_1 / L_2 \approx 2.0475 \). However, none of the provided options match this value. The closest option is **D) ~2.23**, which may reflect a subtle approximation or rounding in the problem's setup. Given the available choices, the most reasonable answer is:
