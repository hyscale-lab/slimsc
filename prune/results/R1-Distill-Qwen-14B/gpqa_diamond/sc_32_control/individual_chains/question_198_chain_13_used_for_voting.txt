Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, wait. I remember that stability constants are used to describe the formation of complexes. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So each β corresponds to a different complex. The first one, β1, is probably the simplest complex, like Co(SCN)n where n is 1, 2, etc.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands attached to Co(II). So I think that's the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which would be the second complex. But wait, the β values go up, so maybe the higher β complexes are more stable.

Wait, the complexes are probably ordered as Co(SCN)n with n=0 to 4. So β1 is for n=1, β2 for n=2, etc. But wait, the numbers aren't necessarily in order of n. Let me check: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Oh, so β3 is the highest, β=63. So the most stable complex is the one with n=3? Or wait, maybe the numbering corresponds to the number of SCN- attached. Hmm, I'm not sure. But the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is two SCN- groups. So that's the n=2 complex.

Wait, no, wait. Cobalt(II) typically has a +2 charge. Each SCN- is -1. So for a neutral complex, the charge would be Co^2+ plus n*(-1) equals the overall charge of the complex. Wait, but the complexes are probably charged, so maybe they are Co(SCN)_n^(2-n). So for n=0, it's Co^2+. For n=1, Co(SCN)^(+1) because 2+ -1=+1. For n=2, Co(SCN)_2^0. For n=3, Co(SCN)_3^-1. For n=4, Co(SCN)_4^-2.

Wait, but the problem mentions "dithiocyanato," which is two SCN- groups. So that would be n=2. So the complex is Co(SCN)_2^0, which is neutral. So the stability constant β2 is for the n=2 complex. Wait, but the β values are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So β3 is the highest, which would be the most stable. So the most stable is the n=3 complex, Co(SCN)_3^-1.

But the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is the n=2 complex. So we need to find the fraction of Co in the n=2 complex compared to all possible complexes and the free ion.

So the approach is to calculate the fraction of Co in each species (n=0, n=1, n=2, n=3, n=4) and then sum them up. Then, the percentage for the n=2 complex would be (its fraction) multiplied by 100.

But how do I calculate that?

I remember that the distribution of metal complexes can be modeled using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligands. The general approach is to calculate the concentration of each complex relative to the free metal ion.

The formula for the fraction of each complex is given by the product of the stability constant and the appropriate power of the ligand concentration, all divided by (1 + sum of all such terms for each complex and the free ion).

Wait, more accurately, the fraction for each complex is [Co(L)n] / [Co^3+] (but wait, in this case, it's Co^2+). So the general expression for the fraction f_n is (β_n * [L]^n) / (1 + sum_{k=0 to 4} β_k [L]^k )

Wait, no. Let me think again. The total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all species: [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-] = c_total.

But the stability constants are defined as:

β_n = [Co(SCN)_n^(2-n)] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^n )

So, [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co^2+][SCN-]^n.

Therefore, the concentration of each complex is β_n [Co^2+][SCN-]^n.

Let me denote [Co^2+] as x. Then, [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n x (SCN-)^n.

But the total cobalt concentration is x + sum_{n=1 to 4} β_n x (SCN-)^n = c_total.

We can factor x out: x (1 + sum_{n=1 to 4} β_n (SCN-)^n ) = c_total.

So x = c_total / (1 + sum_{n=1 to 4} β_n (SCN-)^n )

Once x is found, the concentration of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n x (SCN-)^n.

Then, the fraction of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n] / c_total.

Wait, but wait: the sum of [Co^2+] and all complexes is c_total, so the fraction for each complex is [Co(SCN)_n]/c_total.

So the fraction f_n is [Co(SCN)_n]/c_total = (β_n x (SCN-)^n ) / c_total.

But x = c_total / (1 + sum_{n=1 to 4} β_n (SCN-)^n )

Substituting x into f_n:

f_n = (β_n * (SCN-)^n ) / [1 + sum_{k=1 to 4} β_k (SCN-)^k ) ]

So the fraction for each complex is (β_n * (0.1)^n ) / denominator, where denominator is 1 + sum_{k=1 to4} β_k (0.1)^k.

Wait, but the denominator is 1 + sum_{n=1}^4 [β_n * (0.1)^n ].

Wait, let's compute each term for n=1 to 4.

Compute the denominator:

denominator = 1 + sum_{n=1 to4} β_n [SCN]^n.

SCN is 0.1 M.

So calculate each β_n*(0.1)^n:

n=1: β1=9, (0.1)^1=0.1 → 9*0.1=0.9

n=2: β2=40, (0.1)^2=0.01 → 40 *0.01=0.4

n=3: β3=63, (0.1)^3=0.001 → 63 *0.001=0.063

n=4: β4=16, (0.1)^4=0.0001 →16 *0.0001=0.0016

Sum these up: 0.9 + 0.4 = 1.3, 1.3 + 0.063=1.363, 1.363 +0.0016=1.3646.

Add 1 (for the free ion term), so denominator is 1 + 1.3646 = 2.3646.

Wait, but wait. The denominator is 1 + sum β_n (SCN-)^n. So 1 + 0.9 +0.4+0.063 +0.0016 = 2.3646.

So denominator = 2.3646.

Now, for each n, the fraction f_n is (β_n*(0.1)^n ) / 2.3646.

So for n=0 (free Co^2+), the fraction is 1/(2.3646) ≈ 0.4225.

Wait wait, no. Because the denominator is 1 + sum, the fraction for the free ion is 1/(denominator).

Wait, but in f_n, for the free ion (n=0), its fraction is 1/(denominator) because [Co^2+] = x, and x = c_total/(denominator). So [Co^2+]/c_total = x/(c_total) = 1/(denominator).

So f_0 = 1/(denominator) ≈ 1/2.3646 ≈ 0.4225 or 42.25%.

But the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So f_2 = (β2*(0.1)^2 ) / denominator = (40 * 0.01) / 2.3646 = (0.4) / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, which is about 16.9%.

Wait, but wait. The options include 16.9% as option D.

But wait, that's for n=2, which is the dithiocyanato. So the percentage would be approximately 16.9%.

Wait, but let me recalculate the denominator correctly. Wait, I think I made a mistake in adding the numbers. Let me do the sum again:

n=1: 0.9

n=2: 0.4

n=3: 0.063

n=4: 0.0016

Sum: 0.9 + 0.4 = 1.3; 1.3 +0.063=1.363; 1.363 +0.0016=1.3646.

Denominator is 1 + 1.3646 = 2.3646.

So f_2 is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, which is 16.9%. So option D is 16.9%.

But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I thought that the most abundant would be the most stable, which is β3=63 for n=3. So perhaps I should check if the percentages might be higher for n=3.

Wait, let's calculate all the fractions:

f_0 = 1 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4225 → 42.25%

f_1 = (9 * 0.1) / 2.3646 → 0.9 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.3806 → 38.06%

f_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169 → 16.9%

f_3 = (63 * 0.001) → 0.063 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.0266 → 2.66%

f_4 = (16 * 0.0001) → 0.0016 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.000677 → 0.0677%

Wait, but these add up to 42.25 + 38.06 +16.9 +2.66 +0.0677 ≈ 100%, which is correct (some rounding may have occurred).

So the fractions are:

n=0: ~42.25%

n=1: ~38.06%

n=2: ~16.9%

n=3: ~2.66%

n=4: ~0.0677%

But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So the percentage is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, wait a second. I thought the most stable complex would have the highest fraction. But β3 is the highest, yet its fraction is only 2.66%. That seems counterintuitive. Because β3 is 63, which is much larger than β2=40. So why is its fraction so small?

Ah, because the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. Let me see: the formation of higher complexes depends on both the stability constant and the ligand concentration. For each additional ligand, we need enough ligand to form that complex. If the ligand concentration is low, higher complexes may not form as much because the term βn (SCN)^n may not be that big compared to lower n terms.

Wait, wait, let's compute each term:

n=3: β3 (SCN)^3 =63 * (0.1)^3 =63 * 0.001=0.063.

n=2:40 * 0.01=0.4.

n=1:9 *0.1=0.9.

n=4:16 *0.0001=0.0016.

So n=1 gives 0.9, which is bigger than n=3's 0.063. So even though β3 is higher, because the SCN- concentration is 0.1, the product β3*(SCN)^3 is smaller than β1*(SCN)^1.

So the fraction for n=1 is 0.9/2.3646≈38%, which is the highest. Then n=0 has 42%, which is even higher. So the free ion is more abundant than n=1, which is the first complex. Interesting.

So the order of fractions is: n=0 (42%), n=1 (38%), n=2 (16.9%), then n=3 and 4 are negligible.

Wait, but wait. The problem is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So the answer is 16.9%, which is option D.

So the correct answer should be D) 16.9%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (n=2) among all cobalt-containing species, we use the stability constants and the given concentrations. The stability constant for a complex is defined as:

\[
\beta_n = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_n^{2-n}]}{[\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^n}
\]

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:

\[
c_{\text{total}} = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + \sum_{n=1}^4 [\text{Co(SCN)}_n^{2-n}]
\]

Using the stability constants and ligand concentration \([\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M}\), the fraction of cobalt in each species is given by:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{1 + \sum_{k=1}^4 \beta_k [\text{SCN}^-]^k}
\]

### Step 1: Compute the denominator
The denominator is:

\[
1 + \sum_{k=1}^4 \beta_k [\text{SCN}^-]^k
\]

Substituting the given stability constants (\(\beta_1 = 9\), \(\beta_2 = 40\), \(\beta_3 = 63\), \(\beta_4 = 16\)) and \([\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M}\):

\[
\begin{align*}
\beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 &= 9 \cdot (0.1) = 0.9, \\
\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 &= 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4, \\
\beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 &= 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063, \\
\beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 &= 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016.
\end{align*}
\]

Summing these terms:

\[
0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 1.3646
\]

Adding 1 for the free ion term:

\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + 1.3646 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 2: Compute the fraction for n=2
The fraction of cobalt in the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\text{Denominator}}
\]

Substituting \(\beta_2 = 40\) and \([\text{SCN}^-]^2 = (0.1)^2 = 0.01\):

\[
f_2 = \frac{40 \cdot 0.01}{2.3646} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

Converting to a percentage:

\[
f_2 \approx 0.169 \cdot 100 = 16.9\%
\]

### Step 3: Verify the result
The fractions for all species were computed to ensure they sum to 100%:

\[
\begin{align*}
f_0 &= \frac{1}{2.3646} \approx 0.4225 \, (42.25\%), \\
f_1 &= \frac{0.9}{2.3646} \approx 0.3806 \, (38.06\%), \\
f_2 &= 0.169 \, (16.9\%), \\
f_3 &= \frac{0.063}{2.3646} \approx 0.0266 \, (2.66\%), \\
f_4 &= \frac{0.0016}{2.3646} \approx 0.000677 \, (0.0677\%).
\end{align*}
\]

The total is approximately 100%, confirming the calculations are correct.

### Conclusion
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (n=2) is **16.9%**, corresponding to option D.
