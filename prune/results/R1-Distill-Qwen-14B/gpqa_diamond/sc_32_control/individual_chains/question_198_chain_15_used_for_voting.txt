Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question involves cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution. They're asking about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. Hmm, dithiocyanato... wait, that probably means it's a complex with two thiocyanate ligands.

The problem gives me the concentrations: [Co] is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. Also, the stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, stability constants, I remember that they're used to determine the concentration of metal complexes in solution. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

So, the species present would be various complexes of Co(II) with SCN-. The complexes probably go from Co(SCN)0 up to Co(SCN)_4^2-. Because β1 to β4 are given. Wait, but what's the order? Let me think. For complex ions, the stability constant increases with the number of ligands up to a point. So β1 is for the first ligand, β2 for the second, etc. So Co(SCN)²+ would have β1, Co(SCN)₂²+ would have β2, and so on.

Wait, but the problem is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would be the one with two SCN- ions. So that's the Co(SCN)_2^(II+) complex, right? But wait, wait, I'm confused about the charge. Let me get that straight. Co²+ has a charge of +2. Each SCN- is -1. So if it's Co(SCN)_n, the charge would be 2 - n. So for n=0, it's Co²+; n=1, CoSCN^+, n=2, Co(SCN)_2, which has a charge of 0. So that's the neutral complex. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

The question is about the percentage of the blue ones, which are the dithiocyanato complexes. So that's the Co(SCN)_2^0 complex, I think. So I need to find the fraction of all Co species that are in this form.

Stability constants help us figure out the distribution of species. The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex using the stability constants, and then sum them up for all species.

But how do I approach this when there are four possible complexes? The problem gives β1 to β4, so four complexes. So the complexes would be:

1. Co²+ (β1 is for the first ligand, but maybe the first complex is CoSCN+ with β1=9)
2. CoSCN+ (β1)
3. Co(SCN)_2^0 (β2=40)
4. Co(SCN)_3^- (β3=63)
5. Co(SCN)_4^2- (β4=16)

Wait, no, wait. The stability constant β for each step. So βn is the constant for the nth step. So for each additional SCN-, the β is given. So the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n is the product of β1 to βn. Let me think.

Wait, actually, the stability constant β for a complex is often given as the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. For the first complex, Co²+ + SCN- ↔ CoSCN+, β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co²+][SCN-]) = 9.

Similarly, β2 would be the equilibrium constant for CoSCN+ + SCN- ↔ Co(SCN)_2^0, which is [Co(SCN)_2^0]/([CoSCN+][SCN-]) = 40.

So the overall β for the complex Co(SCN)_2^0 would be β1 * β2? Or is β2 the overall for two ligands? Hmm, I think each β represents a step-wise formation. So the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n would be the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, no. Wait, in the case of complex formation, each β is the step-wise formation. So for example, K1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co²+][SCN-]) = β1. K2 = [Co(SCN)_2^0]/([CoSCN+][SCN-]) = β2. So the overall K for Co(SCN)_2^0 would be K1 * K2 = β1 * β2 = 9 * 40 = 360.

But wait, the problem states the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So for each step, adding another SCN-.

So for each complex, the formation constant is the product up to that β.

So for Co(SCN)_1+ (n=1), K1 = 9.

For Co(SCN)_2^0 (n=2), K2 = 9 * 40 = 360.

Co(SCN)_3^- (n=3), K3 = 9*40*63 = 9*40 is 360, 360 *63= 22680.

Co(SCN)_4^2- (n=4), K4=9*40*63*16. Let me calculate that: 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880.

So the formation constants for each complex are:

n=0 (just Co²+): no formation, so formation constant would be 1 (or just its concentration).

n=1: K=9

n=2: K=9*40=360

n=3: 9*40*63=22680

n=4: 9*40*63*16=362880.

Wait, but I think that's the wrong approach. Because the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n is the product of the step-wise β's up to n. So for each n, the overall K is product of β1 to βn.

Wait, but wait, the stability constant for the complex with n ligands is the cumulative product of β1 through βn. So that's correct.

Now, the distribution of Co species depends on the concentrations of SCN- and the formation constants.

The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex relative to the total. The fraction for each complex is given by (K_n) * [SCN-]^n / (1 + sum over all K_n [SCN-]^n )

Wait, but the formula is a bit more involved because each step adds a ligand. The distribution depends on the concentration of ligand and the formation constants.

Alternatively, the fraction of each species is [Co(SCN)_n] / [Total Co], where [Total Co] is the sum of all [Co(SCN)_m] for m=0 to 4.

But how do I compute [Co(SCN)_n] in terms of [Co²+] and [SCN-]?

Alternatively, the fraction can be found using the formula for each species:

For each n, the fraction f_n is (β1 β2 ... βn) [SCN-]^n / (sum over m=0 to 4 (β1...βm) [SCN-]^m )

Wait, but wait, for m=0, the term is 1 * [SCN-]^0 = 1.

So the numerator for each n is (product up to βn) * [SCN-]^n.

So the total is the sum from m=0 to m=4 of (product up to βm) * [SCN-]^m.

So the fraction f_n is (prod β1..βn) [SCN-]^n / (sum from m=0 to m=4 (prod β1..βm) [SCN-]^m )

In this problem, the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. Let's calculate each term.

Let me compute each term:

For m=0: term is 1 * (0.1)^0 =1.

For m=1: term is β1 * (0.1)^1 =9 * 0.1=0.9.

For m=2: β1*β2 * (0.1)^2 =9*40*(0.01)= 360 *0.01=3.6.

For m=3: β1β2β3 * (0.1)^3= 9*40*63 * 0.001.

Let me compute that: 9*40=360; 360*63=22680. 22680 *0.001=22.68.

Hmm, wait, wait. Wait, no: because each β is step-wise. So for m=3, the term is (β1 * β2 * β3) * [SCN-]^3.

Which is 9*40*63 * (0.1)^3.

9*40=360, 360*63=22680. 22680 * (0.001) =22.68.

Similarly, m=4: (β1β2β3β4) * (0.1)^4.

Which is 9*40*63*16 * 0.0001.

Let me compute that: 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362880. Multiply by 0.0001: 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Wait, that's 36.288.

So now, let me list all the terms:

m=0: 1

m=1: 0.9

m=2: 3.6

m=3: 22.68

m=4:36.288

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check:

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because for m=3, [SCN-]^3 is 0.1^3=0.001. And 9*40*63=22680. 22680 * 0.001 =22.68. That's correct.

Similarly, m=4: [SCN-]^4 is 0.0001. 9*40*63*16=362880. 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So the terms are:

m=0: 1 → 1

m=1: 0.9 → 0.9

m=2: 3.6 →3.6

m=3:22.68 →22.68

m=4:36.288 →36.288

Wait, but wait a second. The [SCN-] is 0.1 M. So [SCN-]^n is (0.1)^n.

But wait, for each complex, the number of SCN- ligands is m, so the term is (β1β2...βm) * (0.1)^m.

So sum all these terms.

So the sum S = 1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Let me compute that:

1 +0.9 =1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288 =64.468.

So the total sum S is 64.468.

Now, the fraction of each species is (term for that m) / S.

We are interested in the fraction for m=2, because that's the dithiocyanato complex (two SCN-).

The term for m=2 is 3.6.

So the fraction f_2 = 3.6 / 64.468 = let's compute that.

3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05557, which is 5.557%.

Wait, but that can't be right, because the options are around 17%, 25%, etc. So wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the way I'm computing the terms.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stability constants. Let me recheck.

Wait, the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, but in the formation of the complexes, each β is for adding one more SCN.

So the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n is the product of β1 through βn.

Wait, but wait. Consider the case where n=1: Co²+ + SCN- ↔ CoSCN+; β1= [CoSCN+]/([Co²+][SCN-]) =9.

n=2: CoSCN+ + SCN- ↔ Co(SCN)_2^0; β2= [Co(SCN)_2^0]/([CoSCN+][SCN-])=40.

So the overall K for Co(SCN)_2^0 is K1 * K2 =9*40=360.

Similarly, for n=3: K3= K1*K2*K3=9*40*63=22680.

n=4: K4=9*40*63*16=362880.

So yes, the terms I used are correct.

Wait, but then why when I compute the fractions, the one for m=2 is only about 5.5%? The options are much higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again. Because the initial concentration of Co²+ is 1e-2 M, but the problem statement says the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. Hmm, but the distribution of Co depends on the ligand concentration and the stability constants.

Wait, perhaps another approach is needed. Let me try a different way. The distribution of the species can be calculated using the formula:

For each complex, the concentration [Co(SCN)_n] is equal to (β1β2...βn) [SCN-]^n [Co²+] / (1 + sum_{m=0}^4 (β1β2...βm) [SCN-]^m )

Wait, but no, that's not quite right. Because the total [Co] is 1e-2 M. So the sum of all [Co(SCN)_m] equals 1e-2 M.

Alternatively, the fraction f_n is [Co(SCN)_n]/([Co²+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)_2^0] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-]) )

But the way to compute this is:

For each n, the fraction f_n is (β1β2...βn) [SCN-]^n / (sum of all (β1β2...βm) [SCN-]^m + 1 )

Wait, no, perhaps the denominator is (1 + sum_{m=1}^4 (β1...βm) [SCN-]^m )

Wait, but wait. Let me think of the formation in terms of sequential steps.

The first step is Co²+ + SCN- ↔ CoSCN+; K1=9.

The second step is CoSCN+ + SCN- ↔ Co(SCN)_2^0; K2=40.

The third step is Co(SCN)_2^0 + SCN- ↔ Co(SCN)_3^-; K3=63.

The fourth step is Co(SCN)_3^- + SCN- ↔ Co(SCN)_4^2-; K4=16.

So the overall formation constants are:

K1 =9

K2=40

K3=63

K4=16

Wait, but wait, for each m, the [Co(SCN)_m] is given by:

[Co(SCN)_m] = K1 * K2 * ... * K_m [Co²+] [SCN-]^m / (1 + K1 [SCN-] + K1 K2 [SCN-]^2 + ... + K1 K2 ... K4 [SCN-]^4 )

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the fraction f_n as (K1K2...Kn [SCN-]^n ) / (sum for m=0 to 4 of K1K2... Km [SCN-]^m )

But wait, when m=0, the term is 1, because all the Ks for m=0 are 1 (since we're not adding any SCN-).

So for each m, the numerator is (product of K1 to Km) * [SCN-]^m.

So for m=0, it's 1 * [SCN-]^0 =1.

So the fractions are (each m's term) divided by the sum of all m's terms.

So I'll compute each term again:

m=0: 1 * (0.1)^0 =1.

m=1: 9 * 0.1^1 =0.9.

m=2: 9*40 * 0.1^2 = 360 * 0.01 =3.6.

m=3:9*40*63 * 0.1^3 =22680 *0.001 =22.68.

m=4:9*40*63*16 * 0.1^4 = 362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

So the sum is 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 =64.468.

So the fraction for m=2 is 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05557 or 5.557%.

But the options are much higher, so that can't be right. Hmm. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I confused the stability constants. Maybe the given β's are the overall constants, not the step-wise ones. Because that would change everything.

Wait, the problem states the stability constants of the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, stability constants are generally given as the formation constants for the entire complex. So β1 would be the K for Co(SCN)_1^+, β2 for Co(SCN)_2^0, etc. So in that case, the overall K for each complex is the same as βn.

Wait, that would change things. Because if β1 is the formation constant for Co(SCN)_1^+, β2 for Co(SCN)_2^0, etc., then for each m, the term is βm * [SCN-]^m.

Wait, but that's conflicting with the initial approach. So perhaps I should model each step correctly.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify whether the β's are step-wise or overall. Because the way I approached earlier assumed step-wise, but perhaps in this question, the β's are the overall formation constants for each n.

Wait, another approach is to think that βn is the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So for n=1, β1=9; for n=2, β2=40; n=3, β3=63; n=4, β4=16.

If that's the case, then each term for m would be βm * [SCN-]^m.

Wait, but that would be, for each m, the term is βm [SCN-]^m.

So then the terms become:

m=0: 1 * (0.1)^0 =1

m=1: 9 * 0.1 =0.9

m=2:40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4

m=3:63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063

m=4:16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

Sum S =1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 =2.3646.

Wait, but this approach gives a sum of 2.3646, but that would make the fraction for m=2 as 0.4 /2.3646 ≈ 0.169, or 16.9%.

Wait, 0.4 /2.3646 → 0.169. So that's about 16.9%, which is option D.

Hmm, but why would the β's be overall constants? Because the way the problem states it is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again about the definition of stability constant.

Stability constant (formation constant) for a complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of that complex from the metal and the ligands.

So for Co²+ and SCN-, the first complex is CoSCN+ (n=1), with β1=9.

The second complex is Co(SCN)_2^0 (n=2), with β2=40. So β2 is the formation constant for the second complex, not the step-wise.

Wait, but that can't be correct. Because the overall formation constant for the second complex would be β1 * β2, assuming β2 is the step-wise constant.

Alternatively, if the β's given are the overall constants for each complex, then for the second complex (n=2), β2 is 40, which would be the product of the step-wise K1 and K2. So K1=9, K2=40/9 ≈4.444.

Wait, this is getting confusing. I think perhaps the way I approached earlier was wrong, and the correct approach uses the β's as the overall constants for each complex.

Let me think again. If βn is the overall K for the complex with n SCN- ligands, then the term for each complex is βn * [SCN-]^n.

So the terms are:

m=0:1

m=1:β1*(0.1)^1 =9 *0.1=0.9

m=2:β2*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4

m=3:β3*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063

m=4:β4*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

So sum S=1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 = 2.3646.

Then, the fraction for m=2 is 0.4 /2.3646 ≈0.169 →16.9%, which is option D.

But earlier, when I considered β's as step-wise, the fraction was only about 5.5%, which isn't among the options.

So perhaps the correct approach is to use each β as the overall formation constant for that complex. Hence, the correct fraction is 16.9%, option D.

Wait, but why does the problem provide β1 to β4? Because if each β is the overall K for that complex, then the fractions would be based on those. So let me proceed with this approach.

But wait, another thought: the stability constants given are for each step, i.e., step-wise, so β1 is for adding the first ligand, β2 for the second, etc. So the overall K for each complex is the product of β1 through βn.

That brings us back to the initial approach, where the fraction was about 5.5%, but that's not an option. So perhaps the given β's are not step-wise but overall.

Alternatively, perhaps the β's are for each complex, and the approach is to compute the fraction for each complex based on their β.

So, βn is the K for Co(SCN)_n, and thus the term is βn [SCN-]^n.

In that case, the sum would be as above, and the fraction for m=2 is 0.4/2.3646≈16.9%, option D.

But what's the correct way to model this?

Wait, a stability constant (formation constant) is generally the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the free metal and the ligands. So for the first complex, CoSCN+, the K is β1=9.

The second complex, Co(SCN)_2^0, has a K of β2=40. So, to form Co(SCN)_2^0, the K would be:

Co²+ + 2 SCN- ↔ Co(SCN)_2^0; K=β2=40.

Similarly, for Co(SCN)_3^-: Co²+ +3SCN- ↔ ...; K=β3=63.

And for Co(SCN)_4^2-: Co²+ +4SCN- ↔ ...; K=β4=16.

Wait, but that's not the standard way. The standard way is that each stability constant is for the step-wise addition. So the K for each step is the step-wise β.

So, the overall K for the n-th complex is the product of β1 to βn.

So I think my initial approach was correct, which leads to m=2's fraction being 5.5%, which is not an option. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the ligand is in excess, so the higher complexes are more dominant, but in this case, [SCN-] is 0.1 M, which is higher than [Co²+] (1e-2 M). Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the possible complexes again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the terms.

Wait, let me recheck the terms. With step-wise β's.

m=0: 1 → 1.

m=1: β1 * [SCN-]^1 →9 *0.1=0.9.

m=2: β1 * β2 * [SCN-]^2 →9*40*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

m=3: β1 * β2 * β3 * [SCN-]^3 →9*40*63 *0.001.

9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *0.1^3=22680 *0.001=22.68.

m=4: 9*40*63*16 *0.1^4.

9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362880; 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So the sum is 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So the fraction for m=2 is 3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05557 →5.557%.

But the options don't include that. So perhaps the given β's are the overall constants for each complex, not the step-wise ones.

In that case, for m=2, the term is 40 * (0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

Sum is 1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016=2.3646.

Fraction for m=2: 0.4 /2.3646 ≈0.169 →16.9%, which is option D.

But why would the β's be given as the overall K for each complex? Because the usual practice is to give step-wise β's.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the β's are the cumulative formation constants. Let me think about that.

In that case, for each m, the term is βm * [SCN-]^m.

So m=0:1.

m=1:9*0.1=0.9.

m=2:40*(0.1)^2=0.4.

m=3:63*(0.1)^3=0.063.

m=4:16*(0.1)^4=0.0016.

Sum is 2.3646.

So for m=2, 0.4/2.3646= ~16.9%.

So the percentage would be 16.9%, option D.

But I'm not entirely confident because I'm not sure if the given β's are step-wise or overall. But given the options, and the fact that my initial approach didn't yield an option, perhaps the correct approach is the second one, using each β as the overall K.

So the answer would be D)16.9%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants (β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16) and the concentrations of Co²⁺ (10⁻² M) and SCN⁻ (0.1 M). The stability constants are interpreted as the overall formation constants for each complex, not the step-wise constants.

### Key Steps:
1. **Species in Solution**: The cobalt species present are:
   - Co²⁺ (free ion),
   - CoSCN⁺,
   - Co(SCN)₂⁰ (neutral complex),
   - Co(SCN)₃⁻,
   - Co(SCN)₄²⁻.

2. **Fraction of Each Species**: The fraction of each species is determined by:
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_n \cdot [\text{SCN}]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^4 \beta_m \cdot [\text{SCN}]^m}
   \]
   where \( \beta_n \) is the stability constant for the nth complex, and \( [\text{SCN}] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \).

3. **Terms for Each Species**:
   - For \( m = 0 \): \( \beta_0 \cdot [\text{SCN}]^0 = 1 \).
   - For \( m = 1 \): \( \beta_1 \cdot [\text{SCN}]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \).
   - For \( m = 2 \): \( \beta_2 \cdot [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \).
   - For \( m = 3 \): \( \beta_3 \cdot [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \).
   - For \( m = 4 \): \( \beta_4 \cdot [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \).

4. **Total Sum**:
   \[
   \text{Sum} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

5. **Fraction of Dithiocyanato Complex**:
   The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)₂⁰]) is:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169 \, \text{or} \, 16.9\%.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**, corresponding to option D.

Answer: D
