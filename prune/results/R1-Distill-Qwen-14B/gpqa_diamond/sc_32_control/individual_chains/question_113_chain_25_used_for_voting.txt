Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and think through each part.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons, varying hydrogens and oxygen counts.

First, let's break down each piece of data and see what it tells me about the structure of the compound.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1 suggests the presence of either O-H or N-H groups. But since the options don't include nitrogen, it's probably O-H, maybe from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, a broad peak can also come from an alcohol. Wait, but another peak at around 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Those are strong absorptions. I recall that carbonyl groups (C=O) usually absorb around 1650-1900 cm^-1. So two peaks in that region. Hmm, maybe one is a carbonyl, and another is something else. Wait, 1700 is a higher wavenumber, which is typical for a carbonyl, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 might be an aromatic ring (C=C stretching) but wait, that's usually lower. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl or an amide, but again, no N here. Alternatively, maybe an ester group, which can have two carbonyl peaks? Or perhaps the 1700 is the C=O, and 1650 is something else, like an aromatic ring or maybe an alcohol O-H (but that's usually a broad peak around 3000).

Wait, but the first FTIR peak is very broad around 3000, which is O-H. So maybe the compound has both an O-H group and a carbonyl. So what structures have both? Esters don't have O-H; they have an ether and ester group. Wait, wait. Wait, wait, maybe it's a carboxylic acid? Because carboxylic acids have both O-H (broad peak) and a C=O (around 1700). But then what's the 1650? Maybe that's an aromatic ring. Or maybe it's an ester where the carbonyl is at 1700, and another group like conjugated double bonds. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone and an alcohol, but that would be less likely because a ketone would be around 1700, and O-H is 3000, but then the 1650? Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl. For example, aromatic ketones can have lower wavenumber for C=O, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in an ester or amide. Or perhaps it's a carbonyl group that's part of an ester or another functional group.

Moving on to the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond. That could be part of an aromatic ring, but in that case, the integration and splitting would be different. Maybe it's a simple alkene. So the structure might have an alkene group.

Now, the Mass Spectrometry data: there's a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm. Let's think about common fragments. The mass 45 is a significant one. For example, it could be a CH3CO (methyl ketone) group, which is 45 (12*2 + 1*3 + 16 = 45). Alternatively, it could be a CH2O fragment, but that's 30. Or perhaps it's the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91. Oh wait, wait. Another possibility: the 45 could be the fragment from an ester group. For example, if you have an ester like CH3CO-O-R, the loss of the R group could leave CH3CO-O, which is 60. Hmm, not 45. Alternatively, maybe it's a cleavage that produces a CH2CH2 group, but that's 28. Alternatively, perhaps the 45 is a CH3CO group, which would be 45. Or maybe it's an acetyl group. So if the compound has an acetyl group, that could produce a fragment of 45.

Putting this together, let's think about the possible functional groups.

So the compound has O-H (from FTIR, broad peak at 3000), C=O (1700), and an alkene (from NMR vinyl H). So possible structures: maybe a ketone with an alcohol and an alkene. Or perhaps a carboxylic acid with an alkene. But wait, carboxylic acids have O-H, but they are usually deprotonated in the NMR, unless in very acidic conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with an alcohol group; but no, esters don't have O-H.

Wait, another angle: the presence of both O-H and C=O could be a hemiacetal or something similar. But hemiacetals are usually from alcohols and aldehydes or ketones. Alternatively, maybe it's a beta-keto alcohol, but that might complicate the IR.

Wait, another thought: the compound could be a cyclic ester, like a lactone, but that would have an ester group, not an O-H. Unless it is a lactone with an additional hydroxyl group. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a ketone and an alcohol. For example, something like cyclohexanone with an adjacent hydroxyl group. Then, the FTIR would show O-H (broad) and C=O (1700), and the NMR would show vinyl protons if there's a double bond elsewhere. But the formula options don't include that.

Looking at the formula options:

A) C6H12O2: degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Let's compute each option.

For option A: C=6, H=12, O=2. So 2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0 = (14 -12)=2. 2/2=1 degree of unsaturation. Wait, that's a single double bond or a ring. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. So that would account for one. So where's the other O? Maybe an ester or a ketone.

Option B: C6H10O: 2*6 +2 =14. 14-10=4. 4/2=2 degrees. So two double bonds or rings.

Option C: C6H10O2: 2*6 +2=14 -10=4. 4/2=2. Two degrees. Maybe two rings or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option D: C6H12O: 2*6+2=14 -12=2. 2/2=1. So one degree, like a double bond or a ring.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which is a double bond (so one degree). So the other degree could be a ring or another double bond.

So, the compound has a double bond (from NMR), and perhaps another ring or another double bond.

But wait, the FTIR shows a C=O stretch as well. So that's another double bond. So the compound has at least two double bonds (C=O and C=C) or a ring and a double bond.

Wait, but let's think about degrees of unsaturation. For example, for option A: 1 degree. So one double bond or ring. But in this case, we have a C=O and a C=C, which would require two degrees. So option A (which has 1 degree) can't support both. So that's a problem. So maybe option A is not correct.

But wait, the problem says that the NMR has vinyl hydrogens—so that's a double bond. The C=O is a double bond as well. So that's two double bonds, which would contribute two degrees of unsaturation.

Looking at the options:

Option C is C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: 2. So two double bonds or rings. So if the compound has a C=O and a C=C double bond, that fits.

Option B is C6H10O: degrees of 2. So two double bonds or rings.

Option D: 1 degree. Can't have both C=O and C=C.

So from this, options C and B are possible.

Wait, let's think about the molecular formula and the mass spec. The mass spec has a peak at 45. If the molecular ion is breaking apart, perhaps losing a fragment of 45.

Wait, the molecular weight of each option:

A) C6H12O2: (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72+12+32=116.

B) C6H10O: 72+10+16=98.

C) C6H10O2: 72+10+32=114.

D) C6H12O: 72+12+16=100.

Wait, the mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z 45. So perhaps the molecular ion breaks into a part of 45. Let's see what could break off.

The common fragment at 45 is the CH3CO+ group (45). So if the molecule has a CH3CO group attached, then upon fragmentation, it could lose the rest and leave 45.

Which of the formulas could have a CH3CO group?

CH3CO would be C2H3O. Wait, but CH3CO is C2H3O? No, wait, CH3CO is C2H4O? Because CH3CO is CH3-C(=O)-, so the formula is C2H3O. Wait, no. Wait, CH3CO is C2H3O? Wait, no: CH3CO is C2H4O? Because CH3 is C1H3, CO is O, so total is C2H4O. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again: CH3CO would be C2H3O? No, wait, CH3 is C1H3, and CO is C1O. So together, CH3CO is C2H4O? Because it's CH3-CO, which is two carbons, three hydrogens from CH3, and the CO has another hydrogen? No, wait, no. CO would be from a carbonyl group, but the actual structure would depend on the substituents. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, the fragment at 45 could be a ketene ion (like (CH3)2C=O), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. The molecular formulas:

If the molecular ion breaks into a fragment of 45, then the molecular weight must be larger than 45. All options are above that.

Looking at option B: molecular weight 98. If the fragment is 45, then the remaining would be 53. But 53 isn't a common fragment. Alternatively, maybe the molecule breaks into two parts, one being 45.

Option C: molecular weight 114. 114 could lose 45, leaving 69. Not sure what 69 is. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a cyclic ester (lactone). For example, a six-membered ring with an ester group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 45 is from an acetyl group. Let's say the compound has an acetyl group (CH3CO), then the molecular formula would have C2H3O as part of it. Let's see:

Option C: C6H10O2. If part of it is CH3CO (C2H3O), then the remaining would be C4H7O. But that might not fit.

Wait, the fragment m/z 45 could also be the result of a McLafferty rearrangement, but that's more common in ketones with alkenes.

Alternatively, think about the possibility of the compound being an ester. Esters have the formula R-O-CO-R'. The IR would show C=O around 1700, and the ester group doesn't have an O-H. But wait, the IR has a broad peak at 3000, so that would suggest an O-H. So maybe it's not an ester.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a beta-keto alcohol. That would have O-H (broad peak), a C=O (from the keto group) and maybe a double bond somewhere. But I'm not sure if that's a common structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ketone with an alcohol group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the possible functional groups again. FTIR: O-H (broad, so maybe alcohol or carboxylic acid), and C=O (1700). So the possibilities are:

- A carboxylic acid: has O-H and C=O. But then the NMR would show the O-H as a broad peak, but maybe in the problem, the O-H is not observed in the NMR? Hmm, but the FTIR shows the O-H is present. Alternatively, maybe it's an aliphatic ketone and an alcohol.

Wait, another angle: the NMR has vinyl protons, so there's a double bond. So the structure must have both a double bond and a C=O.

Putting all together, maybe the compound is an allylic alcohol with a carbonyl group. For example, something like CH2=CHCH2COOH? But that would have formula C5H8O2. But in our options, it's C6H10O2, which would have more carbons.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic structure. Let's think about the possible structures.

If the compound has a six-membered ring with an ester group and an alcohol group, but that's a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diol with a carbonyl group and an alkene. But I'm not certain.

Let me think about each option's possible structures.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation = 1. So a ring or a double bond. But we have a double bond (from NMR) and a C=O (another double bond), so that would require two degrees, which this option doesn't have. So option A is probably not the answer.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation = 2. So two rings or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. But we have a double bond (C=C) and a C=O. So that's two double bonds, which would fit option B. But then, the IR shows O-H, which would imply an alcohol group. So the formula is C6H10O, which suggests a degree of unsaturation of 2.

But wait, the IR also has a C=O around 1700, which would be, for example, a ketone. So if the structure is a dienone (two double bonds), but then the O-H would have to be somewhere else, like an alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclohexenone with an alcohol substituent. So, cyclohexenone has a ring (six-membered), a double bond (C=C) which is part of the ring, and a C=O (the ketone). That would give us one ring (counts as one degree) and the ketone (another degree), so two degrees of unsaturation. That fits option B, which is C6H10O.

But wait, the O count in option B is only one O. So the compound would have a ketone (O) and an alcohol (O), which would require two O's. But option B has only one O. So that can't be. So option B can't have both a ketone and an alcohol group because that would require two O's, but the formula in option B only has one O. So that's a problem. So option B is out.

Moving on to option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation = 2. So two rings or double bonds.

Assuming the structure has a C=O (one double bond) and a C=C (another double bond), that fits. Also, the two O's can be from a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and an alcohol group.

So if the compound is a dienol, like a dienone with an alcohol, that could fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond, but then O would come from the ester.

Wait, another structure possibility: an ester with an alcohol group. But esters don't have O-H, so that can't be. Alternatively, maybe a beta-keto ester, but that would have more O's.

Alternatively, the compound could be a diol with a carbonyl group. For example, something like HOCH2CH2COCH2CH2CH2OH. But that's more than six carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic hemiacetal, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the presence of O-H in IR and a C=O. So maybe it's a hemiacetal, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the structure could be an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. But then, the IR would show a strong C=O, and the O-H from the acid. But the NMR would show vinyl protons. Let's see: the formula would be C6H10O2. Let's calculate: a six-carbon alpha,beta-unsaturated acid would be something like CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. Wait, but that's five carbons in the acid. Alternatively, maybe it's a six-carbon structure. Or perhaps a cyclic structure.

Wait, the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. Let's see: the structure could be a cyclic ester with an alcohol group. But no, cyclic esters are lactones and don't have O-H unless it's a lactol, which is less common.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted cyclohexene with a carbonyl group and an alcohol. For example, cyclohexenone with a hydroxyl group. Let's say, 3-hydroxy-cyclohexanone. That would have a six-membered ring, a ketone, and an alcohol. The formula would be C6H10O2. Let me check: cyclohexanone is C6H10O. Adding an OH would make it C6H10O2. Yes. So the formula fits.

Now, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens. If it's cyclohexenone, the double bond is part of the ring, so the protons adjacent to the double bond would be vinyl. So that fits. The FTIR would show O-H (from the alcohol, broad peak) and C=O (1700 cm^-1). The 1650 might come from the conjugated double bond in the ring (the C=C in the ring, which is conjugated with the ketone, so the C=C might have a lower wavenumber).

In the mass spec, if the molecule breaks into a fragment that includes the acetyl group (CH3CO), that would have a mass of 45. So if the molecule has a CH3CO group, losing the rest would give a peak at 45. For example, if the molecule is (CH2)4CH3CO-OH? No, wait. Alternatively, if the molecule is something like CH2CH2CO-something... Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the McLafferty rearrangement occurs, which is common in ketones with adjacent alkenes. In that case, the molecule might lose a fragment involving the ketone and the alkene.

Wait, but let's get back to the mass spec. The fragment at 45 could be the acetyl group. So if the compound is a cyclohexenone with an acetyl substituent, then upon fragmentation, the acetyl group might come off as a fragment. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, another possibility for m/z 45: the fragment could be a (CH3)2CO+ ion, which is 58. Hmm, not matching. Or maybe something else.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. If we subtract 45, we get 114 -45 =69. What's 69? 69 could be a fragment of C5H11O. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe 45 is a part of the molecule. Let's think: 45 is the mass of CH3CO (C2H4O?), which is 45. So perhaps the molecule is something like CH3CO-(something). So if the formula is C6H10O2, subtracting CH3CO (C2H3O?), we get C4H7O.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of molecular weight. The molecular weight of option C is 114. If the mass spec shows a peak at 45, that could be a fragment. So, for example, the molecule could break into 45 and 69. 69 is a possible mass for a fragment, but I'm not sure what it is.

Alternatively, maybe the 45 comes from a different part. For instance, perhaps the molecule has a benzene ring, but the options don't have enough H for that. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester group, but earlier analysis suggested that the O-H is present.

Alternatively, perhaps the 45 is from an ethyl group, but that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe it's a methyl group attached to something else. Hmm.

Wait, another point: the FTIR has a peak at 1650, which is lower than the typical 1700 for a ketone. So maybe the C=O is conjugated, leading to a lower wavenumber. For example, if the ketone is conjugated with an alkene, the C=O stretch would be around 1650-1700. So that would fit.

Putting it all together, the structure seems to have a six-membered ring with a ketone (C=O) and an alcohol (O-H), and a double bond. So option C is C6H10O2.

Wait, but let's check the other options.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees of unsaturation =1. So one ring or double bond. But we have two (C=C and C=O), so option D is out.

So the possible options are C and B, but option B doesn't have enough O's.

So the correct formula is option C: C6H10O2.

Wait, but the options are:

A) C6H12O2

B) C6H10O

C) C6H10O2

D) C6H12O

So, the correct answer should be C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The key observations and reasoning are as follows:

### FTIR Analysis:
- A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
- Strong absorption peaks at **1700 cm⁻¹** and **1650 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated system, such as an alkene or aromatic ring.

### 1H NMR Analysis:
- Peaks corresponding to **vinyl hydrogens** indicate the presence of a double bond (C=C).

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** is consistent with the CH₃CO group (acetyl group), which has a mass of 45.

### Degrees of Unsaturation:
The degrees of unsaturation for each option were calculated:
- **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**: Degrees of unsaturation = 1 (one ring or double bond).
- **B) C₆H₁₀O**: Degrees of unsaturation = 2 (two rings or double bonds).
- **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**: Degrees of unsaturation = 2 (two rings or double bonds).
- **D) C₆H₁₂O**: Degrees of unsaturation = 1 (one ring or double bond).

The compound must account for:
1. **O-H** (from FTIR), which requires at least one oxygen.
2. **C=O** (from FTIR), which requires another oxygen and contributes one degree of unsaturation.
3. **C=C** (from NMR), which contributes another degree of unsaturation.

### Elimination of Options:
- **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂)**: Only one degree of unsaturation is available, but the compound requires two (C=O and C=C). This option is eliminated.
- **Option B (C₆H₁₀O)**: Only one oxygen is available, but the compound requires two (O-H and C=O). This option is eliminated.
- **Option D (C₆H₁₂O)**: Only one degree of unsaturation is available, but the compound requires two (C=O and C=C). This option is eliminated.
- **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**: Two degrees of unsaturation are available, which can account for the C=O and C=C. Additionally, the two oxygens can accommodate the O-H and C=O groups. This option is consistent with all the data.

### Conclusion:
The compound is most likely **C₆H₁₀O₂**, as it satisfies the spectroscopic data and the degrees of unsaturation.

Answer: C
