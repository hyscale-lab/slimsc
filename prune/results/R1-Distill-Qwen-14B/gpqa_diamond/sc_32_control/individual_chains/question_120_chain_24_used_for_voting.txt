Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. The options are given as inverse powers of parallax. Let's think through this.

First, I remember that parallax is a measure of distance. The parallax (p) is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to a star. So p = 1/d, right? Or wait, is it the other way around? Oh wait, no, the formula is p (in parsecs) equals 1/d (where d is in parsecs). So higher parallax means closer star. That makes sense.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So if I have a range of parallaxes, how does the count of stars in each small range change as parallax increases or decreases.

I think it's related to the distribution of stars in space. Stars are not all at the same distance, so their parallaxes vary. But the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, does that mean they are uniformly spread out in space as well? Or just on the celestial sphere? Hmm, probably it's assuming uniform distribution in space beyond the solar system, like in a galaxy or the universe.

So if stars are uniformly distributed in space, their number density (stars per volume) is constant. Let's denote the number of stars between distances d and d + dd as N. The volume in that shell would be 4π d² dd (since it's a spherical shell). So N = n * 4π d² dd, where n is the number density of stars.

But we need to express this in terms of parallax. Since p = 1/d, then d = 1/p. Let's change variables from d to p. So when d increases by dd, p decreases by dp. Let me get the relationship right. So when d increases by dd, the change in p is dp = - (1/d²) dd. Because dp/dd = -1/d².

So dd = -d² dp. But since we're dealing with positive ranges, maybe I can express it as dd = (1/(p²)) dp, because d = 1/p → d² = 1/p². So, dd = (1/p²) dp.

Substituting back into N, which is n * 4π d² dd. Let's plug in d = 1/p and dd = (1/p²) dp.

So d² is (1/p)^2 = 1/p². So 4π d² becomes 4π (1/p²). Then, multiply by dd, which is (1/p²) dp. So N = n * 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp. So that's n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax, so it's the number in a small range dp. So number per unit parallax is N/(dp) = n * 4π (1/p^4). So the number of stars per unit parallax interval is proportional to 1/p^4.

Looking back at the options, option A is ~ 1/plx^4. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but I should double-check. Another approach: think in terms of flux or number counts. Wait, no, this is about number per unit parallax. So the expression I derived is correct. The number per unit parallax (dN/dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. So the correct option is A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( p = 1/d \). The question assumes stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning their number density \( n \) is constant.

The number of stars in a spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is given by \( N = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 \, dd \), where \( 4\pi d^2 \, dd \) is the volume of the shell. To express \( N \) in terms of parallax, we use \( d = 1/p \) and \( dd = (1/p^2) \, dp \). Substituting these into the expression for \( N \), we get:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{p^2} \, dp = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{p^4} \, dp.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax \( dp \) is proportional to \( 1/p^4 \). This means the number of stars decreases as the fourth power of parallax.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**
