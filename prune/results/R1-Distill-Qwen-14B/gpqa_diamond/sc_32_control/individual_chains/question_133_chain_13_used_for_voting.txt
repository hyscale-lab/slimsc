Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to think it through step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to recall what I know.

The problem says we've got a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters, right?), and it contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.

Wait, orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, HPO4^3-? Or is it PO4^3-? I think it's PO4^3- which is the fully deprotonated species. But wait, depending on the pH, phosphate can exist in different forms. The problem is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, so I think we're talking about PO4^3-.

But first, I need to find out how much of each compound we're dealing with. The molar masses are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol.

So let's calculate the moles of each. For KH2PO4: moles = mass / molar mass. That's 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that. So 1 divided by 136.09 is approximately 0.00734 moles.

Similarly, for Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. Let's see, 1 divided by 178 is about 0.005617 moles.

Wait, so the solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. I think these are buffer components. Because H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so its conjugate bases can form a buffer. KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- (the dihydrogen phosphate ion), and Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2- (the hydrogen phosphate ion). Wait, actually, Na2HPO4 is the sodium salt of HPO4^2-.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The salts dissociate in solution. So, KH2PO4 would dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. And Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions, plus the water of course, but that doesn't affect the ions in solution.

So in solution, we have H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4). Hmm, so these are two adjacent species in the phosphate buffer system.

The problem is about finding the concentration of PO4^3- ions. Wait, but wait a second. PO4^3- is the deprotonated form beyond HPO4^2-. So under what conditions would we have PO4^3-? It would require that HPO4^2- loses another proton. But the solution's pH must be very high for that to happen because the third dissociation constant is very small (Ka3 = 1.8e-12). So unless the solution is very basic, PO4^3- might not be significant.

But wait, the presence of these two salts suggests that the solution is buffered between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, in the second dissociation step. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the buffer system. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation relates the pH of a buffer to the pKa and the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base and acid. So the relevant pKa here is the second one since we're dealing with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)) which is about 7.21 (since log(6.2) is ~0.79, so 8 - 0.79 = 7.21). So the solution should be around pH 7.21, which is a bit basic.

But wait, if the solution is buffered around pH 7.21, which is between the second and third pKa's of H3PO4. So the predominant species would be HPO4^2- and PO4^3-? Or wait, no. Because at pH above pKa2, the HPO4^2- would deprotonate to form PO4^3-. But if the solution is buffered around pKa2, the concentration of PO4^3- would be much lower, because the main species would be HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

Wait, but in our case, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. So the pH is indeed around pKa2, so the [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-] would be similar, with some of the HPO4^2- deprotonating into PO4^3-.

But the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-.

So perhaps I can model the situation using the equilibrium equations.

The relevant reaction is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka for this is Ka3 = 1.8e-12. Wait no, wait. Let me get back to the dissociation steps.

H3PO4 is a triprotic acid:

1. H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- ; Ka1 = 7.5e-3 → pKa1 ≈ 2.12
2. H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- ; Ka2 = 6.2e-8 → pKa2 ≈7.21
3. HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- ; Ka3 = 1.8e-12 → pKa3 ≈11.74

So the third dissociation is the one that gives PO4^3-.

In the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the two salts. So the species present are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But in solution, HPO4^2- can lose a proton to become PO4^3-, and H2PO4^- can gain a proton to become H3PO4 or lose a proton to become HPO4^2-.

But given that the solution is buffered around pKa2 (7.21), the concentration of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- would be similar, but there's a small amount of PO4^3- because of the third dissociation.

Wait, but in this case, the solution would have HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- as the main species, and a tiny amount of PO4^3-.

So, to find [PO4^3-], perhaps I can use the Ka3 expression.

But wait, the first step is to calculate the concentrations of the two initial species in solution.

Total volume is 0.2 liters.

Moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4: 0.00734 mol.

Moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O: 0.005617 mol.

So initial concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.00734 / 0.2 = 0.0367 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005617 / 0.2 = 0.028085 M.

Now, we can think about the buffer system between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The pH is determined by the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-], using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Plugging in the numbers: [HPO4^2-] is 0.028085, [H2PO4^-] is 0.0367.

Ratio = 0.028085 / 0.0367 ≈ 0.766.

Log(0.766) is approximately -0.113.

So pH = 7.21 - 0.113 ≈7.097.

Wait, that's interesting. So the pH of the solution is about 7.1.

But wait, the third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- with Ka3 = 1.8e-12. So at pH 7.1, which is below pKa3 (11.74), the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low.

Because for a solution with pH below pKa, the conjugate base (PO4^3-) would be less than the acid (HPO4^2-). Since pH is much lower than pKa3, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very small.

So to find [PO4^3-], I can use the expression:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange to solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

We know Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.028085 M.

[H+] is 1e-pH. pH is about 7.1, so [H+] is 10^-7.1 ≈ 7.94e-8 M.

Wait, let me calculate that accurately.

pH is approximately 7.1, so [H+] = 10^-7.1 ≈ 7.943e-8 M.

So plugging the numbers in:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / (7.943e-8)

Let me compute that step by step.

First, numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 ≈ 5.0553e-14.

Divide by 7.943e-8: 5.0553e-14 / 7.943e-8 ≈ (5.0553 / 7.943) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.636 * 1e-6 ≈ 6.36e-7 M.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 6.24e-7 M

B) 5.48e-7 M 

C) 2.81e-7 M

D) 3.97e-7 M 

Hmm, my calculation gives approximately 6.36e-7 M, which is closest to option A (6.24e-7). But perhaps I made some approximation errors.

Wait, let me recalculate more precisely.

First, let's calculate the exact pH using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) = approximately 7.207.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005617 / 0.2 = 0.028085 M.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.00734 / 0.2 = 0.0367 M.

So the ratio is 0.028085 / 0.0367 ≈ 0.7664.

Log(0.7664) ≈ log(0.766) ≈ -0.112.

So pH = 7.207 - 0.112 = 7.095.

So [H+] is 10^-7.095 ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

Wait, let me compute 10^-7.095 accurately.

10^-7 is 1e-7. 0.095 is about 0.095, so 10^0.095 ≈ 1.245 (since 10^0.1 ≈1.258). Wait, wait, no. Wait, 10^0.095 is the same as 10^(0.1 -0.005)= 10^0.1 * 10^-0.005 ≈ 1.258 * 0.988 ≈ 1.242. So 10^-7.095 = 10^-7 * 10^-0.095 ≈ (1e-7) / (1.242) ≈ 8.05e-8 M.

So [H+] is about 8.05e-8 M.

Now, computing [PO4^3-]:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]

Rearranged: [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.028085 M.

[H+] =8.05e-8.

So:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / (8.05e-8)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 ≈ 5.0553e-14.

Divide by 8.05e-8: 5.0553e-14 / 8.05e-8 = (5.0553 / 8.05) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.628 * 1e-6 ≈6.28e-7 M.

Hmm, that's 6.28e-7 M, which is very close to option A, which is 6.24e-7.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the moles. For KH2PO4:

1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol.

136.09 is approximately 136.09.

1 / 136.09 = 0.007342 moles.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol.

1 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005617 moles.

So that's correct.

Wait, but wait, what about the contribution of PO4^3- from HPO4^2-? Because HPO4^2- can deprotonate to form PO4^3-. But in the solution, the [H+] is lower than the Ka3, which is very small, so the extent of deprotonation is minimal. So the calculation I did should give the correct [PO4^3-], but perhaps I should consider the activity coefficients or something else. But I don't think that's expected here.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the total amount of phosphate species. Let me think.

The total moles of phosphate would be the sum of H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

But since PO4^3- is a very small concentration, maybe we can approximate that the sum of the other two is roughly equal to the total moles.

Total moles of phosphate from both salts:

KH2PO4 provides 0.007342 moles of H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O provides 0.005617 moles of HPO4^2-.

So total moles of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- is 0.007342 + 0.005617 = 0.012959 moles.

If [PO4^3-] is x, then the sum [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-] ≈ 0.012959 M.

But since x is very small, [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.012959 M.

But wait, in this case, the initial [H2PO4^-] and [HPO4^2-] without considering any further dissociation are 0.0367 M and 0.028085 M, respectively. However, when HPO4^2- dissociates a bit to form PO4^3-, the [HPO4^2-] decreases slightly and [PO4^3-] increases. Similarly, any H2PO4^- can deprotonate to form HPO4^2-, but that's part of the buffer system.

Hmm, perhaps I should set up the equilibrium expressions more accurately.

Let me denote:

Let [H2PO4^-] = a, [HPO4^2-] = b, [PO4^3-] = c.

We know that a + b + c = 0.012959 M (from total moles). But since c is very small, this may not be necessary.

The buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-; the pH is determined by their ratio, which I already calculated as around 7.095.

But for the third dissociation, HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.

So, rearranged, c = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Which is exactly what I computed earlier, giving c ≈6.24e-7 M.

So that's option A.

But wait, another approach is to compute the concentration based on the initial moles and the equilibria. Let me think.

Alternatively, I can calculate the concentration of PO4^3- considering that HPO4^2- is in solution and can dissociate.

But given the pH is ~7.1, which is much lower than pKa3 (11.74), the [PO4^3-] would be very small, as I calculated.

So I think my initial approach is correct, and the answer should be approximately 6.24e-7 M, which is option A.

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the system containing 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O in 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The relevant dissociation constants for H₃PO₄ are Ka₁ = 7.5×10⁻³, Ka₂ = 6.2×10⁻⁸, and Ka₃ = 1.8×10⁻¹², corresponding to pKa₁ ≈ 2.12, pKa₂ ≈ 7.21, and pKa₃ ≈ 11.74.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each compound
- **KH₂PO₄**:  
  Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00734 mol.  
  Dissociates into H₂PO₄⁻ and K⁺. Thus, [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.00734 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0367 M.

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005617 mol.  
  Dissociates into HPO₄²⁻ and Na⁺. Thus, [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005617 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028085 M.

### Step 2: Determine the pH of the solution
The solution is buffered by H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, with the relevant pKa being pKa₂ ≈ 7.21. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}\right)
\]

Substitute the concentrations:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + \log\left(\frac{0.028085}{0.0367}\right)
\]

The ratio \(\frac{0.028085}{0.0367} \approx 0.766\), and \(\log(0.766) \approx -0.113\). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 - 0.113 = 7.097
\]

### Step 3: Calculate [PO₄³⁻]
The third dissociation of H₃PO₄ is:

\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}, \quad K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}
\]

Using the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]

Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]

- \([\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.097} \approx 8.05 \times 10^{-8}\) M.  
- \([\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = 0.028085\) M.  
- \(K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}\).

Substitute these values:

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028085)}{8.05 \times 10^{-8}}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028085) \approx 5.0553 \times 10^{-14}
\]

Then divide by \([\text{H⁺}]\):

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.0553 \times 10^{-14}}{8.05 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.28 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 4: Match the closest option
The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately \(6.28 \times 10^{-7}\) M, which is closest to option **A) 6.24 × 10⁻⁷ M**.

Answer: A
