Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances and figuring out the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question gives me data about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass more than our Sun, but I'm not sure if the mass matters here. The problem seems to be about their elemental abundances, so maybe mass is just extra info.

The given data includes some abundance ratios. For Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex. And [Fe/H]_1 is 0. For Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. So I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres.

Wait, the question says to use the LTE and EW method, but I'm not sure how that affects the calculation. Maybe it's just about using the given ratios correctly.

I remember that the notation [X/Y] means the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y, relative to the Sun. Oh wait, no, wait. The standard notation [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithmic difference from solar values.

The Sun's photosphere has given values: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. Similarly, log(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5.

So nFe/nH_sun = 10^(-4.5) and nMg/nH_sun = 10^(-5).

Now, for Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 is 0. That means the Fe/H ratio is the same as the Sun's. So [Fe/H]=0 → (Fe/H) = solar. So nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Wait, but both stars: Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0, so their Fe abundance is same as the Sun. Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0, so Mg is same as the Sun.

Now, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So [Si/Fe] = log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3. So nSi_1 / nFe_1 = 10^(0.3) * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

But wait, nFe_1 is same as nFe_sun because [Fe/H]=0. So nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun), or wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to express all in terms of H.

Wait, let me think. For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (Fe/H) = solar. So nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (nSi_1 / nFe_1) / (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) = 10^0.3 → nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But since nFe_1 is (nFe_sun * nH_1 / nH_sun) ), wait no, [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun. So [Fe/H]=0 → nFe/nH = nFe_sun/nH_sun. So nFe_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH_1.

Similarly, for nSi_1: nSi_1 = (nFe_1) * [ (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3 ]

Substituting nFe_1:

nSi_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun * nH_1 ) * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3

Simplify: (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1 * 10^0.3.

So nSi_1 = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1 * 10^0.3.

Wait, but nH_1 is the number of H in Star_1. Maybe for the purpose of the ratio, I can express everything in terms of H. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Star_2 is needed, so maybe I should compute nSi_1 and nSi_2, then take the ratio.

Let me proceed to Star_2.

For Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg/nSi)_sun = 0.3 → nMg_2 = nSi_2 * (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) * 10^0.3.

Also, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → nMg_2 / nH_2 = nMg_sun / nH_sun → nMg_2 = (nMg_sun / nH_sun) * nH_2.

So substituting into the first equation:

(nMg_sun / nH_sun) * nH_2 = nSi_2 * (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) * 10^0.3.

Solving for nSi_2:

nSi_2 = [ (nMg_sun / nH_sun) * nH_2 ] / [ (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) * 10^0.3 ]

Simplify:

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * nH_2 * 1/(10^0.3) )

Wait, nMg_sun cancels out.

So:

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * nH_2 * 10^(-0.3).

Wait, but nH_2 is the number of H in Star_2. So, nSi_2 = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * nH_2 * 10^(-0.3).

Now, for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2: nSi_1 / nSi_2.

From above:

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1 * 10^0.3

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * nH_2 * 10^(-0.3)

So ratio = [ (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1 * 10^0.3 ] / [ (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * nH_2 * 10^(-0.3) ]

Simplify: (nH_1 / nH_2) * 10^(0.3 + 0.3 ) = (nH_1 / nH_2) * 10^0.6

But wait, what is the relation between H in the two stars? Because [Fe/H] is 0 for Star_1, which would mean that the overall metallicity is same as the Sun, but Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0. Wait, but wait: [Fe/H] is 0 for Star_1, so nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so nMg_2 / nH_2 = nMg_sun / nH_sun.

But for the ratio nH_1 / nH_2, I need to find a relation. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is assuming that the H content is the same? No, the problem doesn't say that.

Wait, but if I'm considering the photospheric composition, perhaps the only thing that matters is the ratio of elements relative to H.

Wait, perhaps the key is that in Star_1 and Star_2, the overall H abundance is the same as the Sun's because [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are zero. Wait, no, [Fe/H] is about Fe relative to H, not about H itself. The [Fe/H] is zero, which means Fe is same as solar, but H could vary. Oh no, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, but maybe the problem is assuming that the H is the same in both stars as in the Sun. Because [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so Fe is same as solar. But if H is same as solar, then nH_1 = nH_sun. Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2 / nH_sun). But if nH_2 is same as nH_sun, then nMg_2 = nMg_sun. But I'm not sure if the problem is making that assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that the ratio of H in the two stars is the same as the Sun's. But without more data, maybe I should make that assumption. Or perhaps the H abundance is not needed because it cancels out.

Wait, looking back at the ratio I have:

nSi_1 / nSi_2 = (nH_1 / nH_2) * 10^0.6.

Hmm, but without knowing the ratio of H between the two stars, I can't compute this. That suggests I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So for Star_1, the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as the Sun. So nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun → nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg_2 = (nMg_sun / nH_sun) * nH_2.

But I don't have any info about the overall abundance of H in the stars. Hmm. Maybe the problem is implying that both stars have the same H abundance as the Sun, but I'm not certain. Let me check the given data again.

Wait, the problem says [Fe/H]_1 = 0, which is about Fe relative to H. [Mg/H]_2 = 0 is about Mg relative to H. But what about their overall H? If the stars have the same H as the Sun, then nH_1 = nH_sun and nH_2 = nH_sun, so nH_1 / nH_2 = 1. Then the ratio would be 10^0.6.

What's 10^0.6? Let me calculate that. 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98. So approximately 3.98, which is about 4. Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9.

But wait, is that correct? Because if the H is same, then nH_1 / nH_2 is 1, and the ratio would be 10^0.6 ≈3.98.

But why would the H be same? Because the [Fe/H] is zero, which relates Fe to H but doesn't necessarily mean H is same as Sun. Unless the metallicity [Fe/H] is zero, which would mean that the star has same Fe as the Sun, but the overall H could be different. But I don't think the problem gives me enough info on that. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the photospheric composition. For a star with [Fe/H] =0, the number of Fe atoms per H is same as the Sun. But the total number of H could be different, which would affect nFe but not [Fe/H]. Similarly, for [Mg/H]_2=0, Mg per H is same as Sun.

Wait, but the ratio of H in the two stars could be anything, but the problem asks for the ratio of Si atoms in their photospheres. But if the H is varying, then the Si would depend on H. Unless the problem is assuming that H is the same in both, which I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the ratio of H in the two stars is the same as the Sun's. Let me think about the Sun's composition.

Wait, for the Sun, nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5), and nMg/nH is 10^(-5). So for Star_1, since [Fe/H]_1=0, nFe/nH in Star_1 is same as Sun. So nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun).

Similarly, nSi_1 is determined by [Si/Fe]_1. Let's compute nSi_1.

nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

Because [Si/Fe] = log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun) ) = 0.3 → nSi/nFe = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

So substituting nFe_1 = (nFe_sun * nH_1)/nH_sun.

So nSi_1 = (nFe_sun * nH_1)/(nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

Simplify: (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * nH_1 * 10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

nMg_2 = (nMg_sun * nH_2 )/nH_sun.

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg_sun /nSi_sun) ) = 0.3 → nMg_2 = nSi_2 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) * 10^0.3.

Substituting nMg_2:

(nMg_sun * nH_2)/nH_sun = nSi_2 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

Solve for nSi_2:

nSi_2 = [ (nMg_sun * nH_2 )/(nH_sun) ] / [ (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^0.3 ]

Simplify:

nSi_2 = (nH_2 / nH_sun) * (nMg_sun * nSi_sun) / (nMg_sun) ) * 10^(-0.3) )

Wait, nMg_sun cancels, so:

nSi_2 = (nH_2 / nH_sun) * nSi_sun * 10^(-0.3)

So nSi_2 = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * nH_2 * 10^(-0.3).

Now, the ratio nSi_1 / nSi_2 is:

[ (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * nH_1 *10^0.3 ] / [ (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * nH_2 *10^(-0.3) ]

Simplify: (nH_1 /nH_2) * 10^(0.3 +0.3) ) → (nH_1 /nH_2) * 10^0.6.

Hmm, so the ratio depends on nH_1 /nH_2. But I don't know how nH_1 and nH_2 compare. Unless I can find a relation between them.

Wait, perhaps if I consider that for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0 → nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

And the overall metallicity [Fe/H] is zero, which means the abundance of Fe relative to H is same as the Sun, but the problem doesn't give [H] or [M/H] for either star. So maybe I can't determine nH_1 and nH_2 separately, only their ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the H abundance in each star is the same as the Sun's. That would make nH_1 = nH_sun and nH_2 = nH_sun, so nH_1/nH_2 = 1.

If that's the case, then the ratio is 10^0.6 ≈3.98 → approximately 4. So the answer would be option A (~3.9).

But is that a valid assumption? The problem doesn't explicitly say that their H is same as the Sun's. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the H to be same because the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are zero, but that doesn't necessarily imply that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering that the H is same in both stars, so the ratio of H is 1. Then the ratio of Si is 10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is option A.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the absolute abundances.

Wait, the Sun's composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH =1e-4.5.

Similarly, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) =-5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

So for the Sun, nFe = 1e-4.5 * nH.

nMg = 1e-5 *nH.

nSi in the Sun? Wait, the Sun's nSi isn't given, but I can calculate it using some solar abundance.

Wait, in the solar photosphere, the main elements are H, He, and metals. But without knowing the exact solar Si abundance, perhaps I can find it using other ratios. Wait, but in the problem, the Sun's [Si/Fe] isn't given. So perhaps I can't compute it directly.

Wait, but maybe I can use the given [Mg/Si] for Star_2. Let's see. For Star_2, [Mg/Si] =0.3. But wait, Star_2's [Mg/Si] is 0.3, but I don't know the Sun's [Mg/Si]. Hmm, maybe I can compute it from the Sun's nMg and nFe, but I'm not sure.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of solar abundances.

Wait, let me think about Star_1 and Star_2.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun).

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → nSi_1 =nFe_1 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

Substituting nFe_1: nFe_1 = (nFe_sun *nH_1)/nH_sun.

So, nSi_1 = (nFe_sun *nH_1 /nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

Simplify: (nH_1 /nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun) ) *10^0.3.

Wait, no, let's go again.

nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But nFe_1 = (nFe_sun * nH_1 ) / nH_sun.

So substituting:

nSi_1 = (nFe_sun * nH_1 /nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

nFe_sun and (nFe_sun) cancel, so:

nSi_1 = (nH_1 /nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun) ) * 10^0.3.

Wait, no:

Wait, (nFe_sun * nH_1 /nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) → (nH_1 /nH_sun) * nSi_sun.

So,

nSi_1 = (nH_1 /nH_sun) * nSi_sun * 10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

nMg_2 = (nMg_sun *nH_2 )/nH_sun.

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) - log(nMg_sun /nSi_sun) )=0.3 → nMg_2 =nSi_2 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

So substituting nMg_2:

(nMg_sun *nH_2 )/nH_sun = nSi_2 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

Solving for nSi_2:

nSi_2 = (nMg_sun *nH_2 /nH_sun ) / (nMg_sun /nSi_sun *10^0.3 )

Simplify:

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /nMg_sun) *nMg_sun * 10^(-0.3) )

Wait, the nMg_sun cancels, so:

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_sun) * nSi_sun * 10^(-0.3).

So, nSi_1 = (nH_1 /nH_sun) * nSi_sun *10^0.3.

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_sun) *nSi_sun *10^(-0.3).

So the ratio nSi_1 /nSi_2 is:

[ (nH_1 /nH_sun) *nSi_sun *10^0.3 ] / [ (nH_2 /nH_sun)*nSi_sun *10^(-0.3) ) ]

Simplify: (nH_1 /nH_2 ) *10^(0.3 +0.3) = (nH_1 /nH_2) *10^0.6.

But again, I'm stuck on finding nH_1 /nH_2. Since the problem doesn't give any info about the H abundance in the stars relative to each other, perhaps the assumption is that H is same in both, making the ratio 1. That would make the ratio 10^0.6 ≈3.98.

But I'm not 100% confident. Let me think if there's another way. Oh wait! In the Sun, the [Fe/H] is zero, so nFe_sun /nH_sun is a known value. But how does that help?

Alternatively, considering that both stars have the same [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] as the Sun, but that doesn't necessarily imply same H.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the individual [Si/H] for each star and then take the ratio.

Let me try that approach.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun).

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → nSi_1 =nFe_1 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

So, nSi_1 = (nFe_sun *nH_1 /nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

nFe_sun cancels: nSi_1 = (nH_1 /nH_sun) * (nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

Similarly, [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi_1 /nH_1 ) - log(nSi_sun /nH_sun ) = log( (nH_1 /nH_sun) *nSi_sun *10^0.3 /nH_1 ) ) - log(nSi_sun /nH_sun )

= log( (1/nH_sun) *nSi_sun *10^0.3 ) - log(nSi_sun /nH_sun )

= log( (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *10^0.3 ) - log(nSi_sun /nH_sun )

= log(10^0.3 ) → 0.3.

So [Si/H]_1 =0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → nMg_2 =nSi_2 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun).

So,

nMg_2 =nMg_sun*(nH_2 /nH_sun) = nSi_2 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

Solving for nSi_2: nSi_2 = (nMg_sun *nH_2 /nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun /nMg_sun) *10^(-0.3 )

Simplify: nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_sun) *nSi_sun *10^(-0.3 )

Thus, [Si/H]_2 = log(nSi_2 /nH_2 ) - log(nSi_sun /nH_sun )

= log( (nH_2 /nH_sun) *nSi_sun *10^(-0.3 ) /nH_2 ) ) - log(nSi_sun /nH_sun )

= log( (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *10^(-0.3 ) ) - log(nSi_sun /nH_sun )

= log(10^(-0.3 )) → -0.3.

So [Si/H]_1 =0.3 and [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

Thus, the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2 is 10^[0.3 - (-0.3)] = 10^0.6 ≈3.98.

So the ratio is about 4, which corresponds to option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and apply the logarithmic abundance notation. The key steps are as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex: This means the ratio of silicon to iron in Star_1 is \( 10^{0.3} \) times the solar ratio.
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex: The iron-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex: This means the ratio of magnesium to silicon in Star_2 is \( 10^{0.3} \) times the solar ratio.
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex: The magnesium-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun.

3. **Solar Photospheric Composition**:
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \).
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \).

### Analysis:
#### Star_1:
- From [Fe/H]_1 = 0, the iron-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun: \( n_{\text{Fe,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}}} \).
- From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, the silicon-to-iron ratio in Star_1 is \( 10^{0.3} \) times the solar ratio:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{Fe,1}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si,sun}}/n_{\text{Fe,sun}}}.
  \]
- Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}}} \), we find:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}}}.
  \]

#### Star_2:
- From [Mg/H]_2 = 0, the magnesium-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun: \( n_{\text{Mg,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}}} \).
- From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, the magnesium-to-silicon ratio in Star_2 is \( 10^{0.3} \) times the solar ratio:
  \[
  n_{\text{Mg,2}}/n_{\text{Si,2}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Mg,sun}}/n_{\text{Si,sun}}}.
  \]
- Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}}} \), we find:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}} = 10^{-0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}}}.
  \]

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{(n_{\text{Si,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}}}{(n_{\text{Si,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}}) \cdot 10^{-0.3} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}}}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.6} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}}.
\]

#### Assumption:
The problem does not provide explicit information about the hydrogen abundance in the stars. Assuming the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars (\( n_{\text{H,1}}/n_{\text{H,2}} = 1 \)), the ratio simplifies to:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.6}.
\]

### Calculation:
\[
10^{0.6} \approx 3.98.
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
