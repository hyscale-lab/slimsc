Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. The classic example is a mass on a spring. But wait, this is relativistic, so I need to consider how relativity affects the system.

The question asks for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me think about what I know about harmonic oscillators and relativity.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², so the kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv². Setting them equal, I get v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But this is a relativistic problem, so I can't just use that.

Relativistically, the energy considerations change because of the Lorentz factor. The total energy isn't just KE + PE but includes the rest mass energy. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential, and when it's at maximum speed (at the equilibrium point), all energy is kinetic.

Wait, but wait, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The total energy E is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the kinetic energy is E - mc².

But the potential energy in a relativistic harmonic oscillator... Hmm, I'm not entirely sure how the potential is treated. In the non-relativistic case, it's (1/2)kx². But relativistically, maybe it's modified somehow. I think the potential energy might still be treated as (1/2)kA² when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps relativistic corrections are made to the potential.

Alternatively, maybe the system is treated using the relativistic form of the oscillator equation. Wait, the problem says it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx, so maybe the potential is still (1/2)kx².

So in this case, the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic and potential energy. Wait no, in relativistic mechanics, the energy of the system would be the total energy, including rest mass energy.

Wait, perhaps considering the energy conservation. At the maximum displacement A, the oscillator is at rest, so its velocity is zero, and all energy is potential. So the potential energy is (1/2)k A². But wait, in relativity, when the particle is at rest, its energy is just mc². But when it's moving, the energy is mc² plus kinetic energy.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again: for a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy might be similar to the non-relativistic case, but the kinetic energy includes relativistic effects.

So, the total energy E of the system at any point is the sum of the rest energy (mc²), the kinetic energy (which is (gamma -1) mc²), and the potential energy (1/2 k x²). But actually, in most formulations, the potential energy in relativistic mechanics is treated as a part of the total energy. Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, think about the energy in terms of the relativistic equation of motion. The equation for a relativistic harmonic oscillator isn't the same as the Newtonian one. The force is F = -kx, but in relativity, the momentum p is gamma m v, and F is dp/dt.

Wait, the relativistic equation of motion for a harmonic oscillator would be d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Maybe it's better to look for expressions involving energy.

At the maximum amplitude A, the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. So the potential energy U is (1/2)k A². But since it's relativistic, perhaps I need to consider relativistic expressions for momentum and energy.

Wait, the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. At A, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero, but wait, that can't be right because the potential energy is non-zero. So E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

But when the oscillator is at the equilibrium point (x=0), it's moving with maximum speed. At that point, all the energy is kinetic. So E equals the rest energy plus the kinetic energy.

Wait, but when at maximum speed, x=0. So the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. So E = mc² + K.

Wait, but in relativity, the kinetic energy K is (gamma - 1) mc². So at the equilibrium point, E = gamma mc².

But wait, from the other point (x=A), E is mc² + (1/2)k A². So these two expressions should be equal.

So setting them equal:

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2) k A².

Divide both sides by mc²:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, but gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote that (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some term. Let's compute it. Let me call it (k A²)/(2 m c²) = alpha.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

Wait, but alpha could be small or not? Hmm, but in this problem, it's a general case, so I can't assume smallness.

Let me square both sides to get rid of the sqrt.

1 / (1 - v²/c²) = (1 + alpha)^2.

Take the reciprocal of both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1 / (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2].

Which can be written as:

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ].

Hmm, then v_max would be sqrt(c² [1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ]) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2).

Wait, but alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²). So substituting back in:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2))^2 )

Hmm, looking at the options, let me check option D.

Option D says: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 )

Wait, that's exactly what I have here. So option D would be the correct answer.

But wait, let me double-check my steps. So E at maximum A is mc² + (1/2)k A². At maximum speed, E is gamma mc².

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, but maybe I should think carefully about the potential energy. Because in some relativistic treatments, the potential energy might have a different form. Oh wait, another approach: In the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)k x²/(gamma), but I'm not sure. Hmm, I might have made a mistake there.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the potential energy is (1/2)k x², same as non-relativistic, but the kinetic energy is relativistic. So when the mass is at position A, its velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero, and the total energy is just the rest energy plus the potential energy.

Wait, but that would imply E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

And when it's moving, E = gamma mc². So gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

So same equation as before. So the steps I took earlier should be correct, leading to option D.

But wait, looking at the options again:

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c^2))^2 )

Wait, let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2, which under the square root.

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2:

= [ (1 + alpha)^2 -1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2

= [1 + 2 alpha + alpha² -1 ] / (1+alpha)^2

= (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha^2) ) / (1 + alpha)^2 )

Wait, but maybe I can factor that.

Wait, 2 alpha + alpha² = alpha (2 + alpha).

Hmm, but I'm not sure that helps. Alternatively, perhaps factor the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: the energy equation.

The total energy in the relativistic oscillator is E = gamma m c² = mc² + (1/2)k x^2. Wait, that doesn't seem right, because in relativity, the potential energy might not just be (1/2)k x². Or maybe for a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential is treated differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the invariant mass. The total energy squared minus (momentum times c)^2 should be equal to (m c²)^2.

So,

E^2 = (pc c)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

At maximum displacement, when x = A, velocity v=0, so p=0. So E at that point is E = mc² + (1/2) k A².

Wait, but in that case, E^2 = ( (0) )^2 + (m c²)^2, which implies E = mc². But that's only true if (1/2)k A² is zero, which it's not. So that approach can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the potential energy is (1/2)k x². Maybe in the relativistic case, the potential energy is treated differently. Maybe it's part of the energy, but without the 1/2 factor.

Wait, another approach. Maybe using the Hamiltonian formalism for the relativistic oscillator.

The Hamiltonian for a relativistic particle is H = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). But if the particle is subject to a potential V(x) = (1/2)k x², then the total Hamiltonian would be H = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + m² c^4 ) + (1/2)k x².

At maximum displacement x=A, the momentum p is zero, so H = (m c² ) + (1/2)k A².

At maximum speed, x=0, so the potential energy is zero, and H is the relativistic kinetic energy plus rest mass energy. So H is sqrt( p^2 c^2 + m² c^4 ), which is gamma m c².

So setting these equal:

gamma m c² = m c² + (1/2)k A².

Divide both sides by m c²:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Which is the same equation as before. So same result. Then, gamma = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)].

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So solving for v:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(gamma)^2.

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(gamma)^2.

Which gives v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma² ).

But gamma is 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) = 1 + alpha, where alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 )

Which is the same as option D.

So option D is correct.

But wait, looking at the options:

Option D is written as v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I have.

Hmm, but wait, let me compute (1 + alpha)^2 = 1 + 2 alpha + alpha². For small alpha (non-relativistic case), alpha² is negligible, so approximately 1 + 2 alpha. Then, 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ≈ 1/(1 + 2 alpha ) ≈ 1 - 2 alpha.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - (1 - 2 alpha )) ) = c * sqrt( 2 alpha )

Which is c * sqrt(2 (k A²)/(2 m c^2)) ) = c * sqrt( (k A²)/(m c^2) ) * sqrt(2) ?

Wait, sqrt( (k A²)/(m c²) ) is (sqrt(k/(m c²)) ) A.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let's compute 2 alpha:

2 alpha = 2 (k A²)/(2 m c^2) ) = (k A²)/(m c^2).

So,

sqrt(2 alpha) = sqrt( (k A²)/(m c^2) ) ) = (A sqrt(k/(m c²)) ) )

But in the non-relativistic case, v_max is sqrt( k A² / m ), which is A sqrt( k/m ). So the relativistic case would have that multiplied by sqrt(1/(c²)) ) times something else. Hmm, but in any case, the non-relativistic limit would be when alpha is small, so (1 + alpha)^2 ≈1 + 2 alpha. So 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ≈ 1 - 2 alpha. So,

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - (1 - 2 alpha) ) = c sqrt(2 alpha).

Which is c * sqrt(2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)) ) = c * sqrt( (k A²)/(m c^2) )

Which is sqrt( (k A²)/(m c^2) ) * c = A * sqrt( k/(m c^2) ) * c = A sqrt( k/(m c^2) ) * c

= A sqrt( (k c^2)/(m c^4) ) * c^2? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me compute it again.

Wait, 2 alpha = (k A²)/(m c²).

So sqrt(2 alpha) = sqrt( (k A²)/(m c²) ) = A sqrt( k/(m c^2) )

Then, v_max = c * sqrt(2 alpha ) = c * A sqrt( k/(m c^2) )

= c * A * sqrt( k ) / sqrt( m c² )

= c * A * sqrt(k/(m c^2)) )

= c * A * sqrt( (k)/(m) ) / c

= A * sqrt( k/m )

Which is the non-relativistic result. So that makes sense. So the relativistic expression reduces to the non-relativistic case when (k A²)/(2 m c^2) is small, which is the case when the speed is much less than c.

So this confirms that option D is correct.

To determine the maximum speed \(v_{\text{max}}\) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \(m\), maximum amplitude \(A\), and obeying Hooke's law (\(F = -kx\)), we analyze the system using relativistic energy conservation principles.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy \(E\) of the system is the sum of the rest energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy. At maximum displacement \(x = A\), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential:
   \[
   E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]
   At maximum speed \(v_{\text{max}}\), the oscillator is at the equilibrium point (\(x = 0\)), and all energy is kinetic:
   \[
   E = \gamma mc^2,
   \]
   where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\) is the Lorentz factor.

2. **Equating Energies**:  
   Setting the two expressions for \(E\) equal gives:
   \[
   \gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]
   Dividing through by \(mc^2\), we find:
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]

3. **Relating \(\gamma\) to \(v_{\text{max}}\)**:  
   The Lorentz factor is defined as:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
   \]
   Substituting \(\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\), we solve for \(v_{\text{max}}\):
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]
   Squaring both sides:
   \[
   \frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2.
   \]
   Taking the reciprocal:
   \[
   1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]
   Rearranging:
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]
   Finally:
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches **Option D**:
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
