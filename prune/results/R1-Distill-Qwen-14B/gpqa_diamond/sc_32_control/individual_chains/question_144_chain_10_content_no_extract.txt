Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think this through.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. They've given me the production energy E_X, mass m_X, and width Γ_X. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle can be found using the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle relates the lifetime of a particle to its energy uncertainty. The formula I think is τ ≈ ħ / Γ, where Γ is the width, which is related to the uncertainty in energy.

But wait, what's the relation between the decay width and the mean lifetime? Oh yeah, the total decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ is ħ divided by Γ. But wait, Γ is given in MeV, so I have to convert that into appropriate units.

Also, the mean decay distance is the product of the velocity of the particle and the mean lifetime. So L = v * τ.

But I need to find the velocity v of the meson. Since the meson is produced with a certain energy, I can find its velocity from that. The energy E_X is given as 8 GeV, and the rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So I should calculate the relativistic gamma factor.

The energy of a relativistic particle is E = γ m c². So γ = E/(m c²). Wait, but m is given in GeV/c²? Or is m in GeV? Oh, I think in particle physics, masses are often given in GeV/c², but sometimes just GeV. Wait, no, the units are usually GeV/c². So, m_X is 1.2 GeV/c². Then E_X is 8 GeV, which is the total energy.

So gamma, γ = E / (m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) = 8 / 1.2. Let me calculate that. 8 divided by 1.2 is 6.666..., so about 6.6667.

Then the velocity v is given by v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Hmm, wait, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/gamma. So 1 - v²/c² = 1/gamma². So v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma². Therefore, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma)^2).

Let me compute that. Gamma is 6.6667. So gamma squared is about 44.4444. 1/(gamma squared) is 1/44.4444 ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So v ≈ c * 0.9887, which is about 0.9887c.

So the velocity is about 0.9887 times the speed of light. So roughly, v ≈ 2.96e8 m/s (since c is ~3e8 m/s).

Now, let's find the lifetime τ. The width Γ is 320 MeV. But wait, I remember that in natural units, ħ c is about 197.3 MeV fm (femtometers), but perhaps I should convert everything into SI units.

Wait, but the formula τ = ħ / Γ. But Γ has units of energy, and ħ has units of J·s.

So Γ is 320 MeV. Let me convert that to Joules. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 320 MeV is 320e6 eV. So 320e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 320e6 * 1.602e-19 = 5.1264e-11 J.

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (1.05457e-34 J·s) / (5.1264e-11 J) ≈ 2.057e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 1e-24 seconds is a very short time, but that's typical for particles with short lifetimes. Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should use natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but then I have to be careful with units.

Wait, another approach: in particle physics, the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But Γ is in MeV, and ħ is in MeV·s when using appropriate units. Wait, because ħ c ≈ 197.3 MeV·fm, so ħ = 197.3 MeV·fm / c. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe it's easier to compute everything in natural units and then convert to meters.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the mean decay length formula, which is L ≈ c * τ * v. Wait, so that's the velocity multiplied by the lifetime.

So, L = v * τ.

We have v ≈ 0.9887c, and τ is ħ / Γ.

Wait, but let me compute τ properly.

Γ is given as 320 MeV. Let me compute τ in seconds.

Γ (in MeV) = 320 MeV.

In natural units, where c=1 and ħ=1, the relation is Γ (in MeV) = 1/(τ (in seconds)) * ħ c^5 / (1.519e-24 MeV·s)).

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute Γ in seconds^-1.

Wait, no, alternative approach:

We know that Γ = ħ / τ → τ = ħ / Γ.

But I need to make sure the units are correct. Let me convert Γ from MeV to J.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 320 MeV is 320e6 eV, so 320e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 5.1264e-11 J.

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So τ = ħ / Γ = 1.05457e-34 J·s / 5.1264e-11 J.

Calculating that: 1.05457e-34 / 5.1264e-11 = approximately 2.057e-24 seconds.

Now, compute the decay length L = v * τ.

v ≈ 0.9887c ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So L = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s ≈ 6.103e-16 meters.

Wait, but none of the options are exactly 6e-16 m. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 5.0223 *10^-16 m

B) 4.0655 *10^-15 m

C) 5.0223 *10^-15 m

D) 4.0655 *10^-16 m

Hmm, my calculation gives around 6e-16 m, but that's not an option. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, where did I go wrong? Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity calculation. Let me re-calculate the gamma and velocity.

E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV. So gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

So beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) → sqrt(1 - (1/(44.4444))) → sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So that's correct.

So v ≈ 0.9887c → ~2.966e8 m/s.

Wait, but perhaps I should be using the total energy more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered relativistic equations more carefully.

Wait, another approach: The mean decay length is given by L = (c * τ) * beta gamma.

Wait, alternatively, I think L = v * τ. So v is beta * c, so L = beta * c * τ.

Wait, but in that case, L = beta * c * (ħ / Γ).

Wait, let me compute beta * c * ħ / Γ.

Beta is 0.9887, c is 3e8 m/s. So beta c is 2.966e8 m/s.

So L = (2.966e8 m/s) * (1.05457e-34 J·s) / (5.1264e-11 J) )

Wait, but wait, that's the same as 2.966e8 * (1.05457e-34 / 5.1264e-11 )

Which is 2.966e8 * (2.057e-24) → 2.966e8 * 2.057e-24 = ~6.1e-16 m. As before.

Hmm, but the options are A: ~5e-16, D: ~4e-16.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recompute gamma.

Wait, E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = E_X/(m_X c²). But wait, in natural units, E is in GeV, m in GeV/c², so E = gamma m c². So gamma is E/(m c²) → 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV/c² * c²) ) → 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667, as before.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the energy as the rest energy plus kinetic energy, but in this case E is the total energy, so that's correct.

Another thought: Perhaps I should have considered the particle's velocity in terms of the momentum. Maybe a better approach. The energy E is 8 GeV. The mass is 1.2 GeV/c². So the momentum p is sqrt( (E)^2 - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

Wait, E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → pc = sqrt(E^2 - (m c²)^2).

So p = sqrt( (8 GeV)^2 - (1.2 GeV)^2 ) / (c).

Wait, 8^2 is 64, 1.2^2 is 1.44. So 64 - 1.44 = 62.56.

So p = sqrt(62.56 GeV²) / c → sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV/c.

So p = 7.91 GeV/c.

Then, the velocity can be found from p = gamma m v → v = (p c) / (gamma m).

Wait, but gamma is E/(m c²)= 8/(1.2) = 6.6667.

Wait, but let's compute beta (v/c):

beta = p c / (E) → since E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v → v = beta c.

So p c = gamma m beta c² → p c = beta gamma m c².

But E = gamma m c² → so p c = (beta) E → beta = (p c) / E.

So p is 7.91 GeV/c → p c = 7.91 GeV.

E is 8 GeV → beta = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) = 0.98875.

So same result as before. So beta is approximately 0.98875.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of the lifetime is correct, but perhaps I should express it in terms of other constants.

Wait, another approach: The lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. But I need to make sure that ħ is in the right units.

Wait, when Γ is in MeV, ħ in MeV·s.

What's ħ in MeV·s? Since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, and ħ = 1.05457e-34 J·s → so ħ in MeV·s:

ħ = 1.05457e-34 J·s * (1 MeV / 1.602e-13 J) ) → because 1 MeV is 1.602e-13 J.

Wait, 1.05457e-34 J·s / (1.602e-13 J/MeV) ) = 1.05457e-34 / 1.602e-13 MeV·s ≈ 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

Wait, so ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 MeV·s? Wait, wait, no:

Wait, 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1 MeV = 1e6 eV = 1.602e-13 J.

So ħ = 1.05457e-34 J·s = (1.05457e-34 J·s) * (1 MeV)/(1.602e-13 J) ) → 1.05457e-34 / 1.602e-13 ≈ 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

Yes, so ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 MeV·s? Wait, no. Let me compute:

1.05457e-34 J·s / 1.602e-13 J/MeV = 1.05457e-34 / 1.602e-13 ≈ 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

Yes, so ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 MeV·s? Wait no, 6.582e-22 MeV·s is correct.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-22 MeV·s) / (320 MeV) → 6.582e-22 / 320 ≈ 2.0569e-24 seconds.

Same as before.

So now, L = v * τ = (0.9887 * 3e8 m/s) * (2.0569e-24 s) → 0.9887 *3e8 = 2.966e8 m/s.

So 2.966e8 m/s * 2.0569e-24 s = 2.966e8 * 2.0569e-24 → Let's compute this.

Multiply 2.966e8 and 2.0569e-24:

2.966 * 2.0569 ≈ 6.113, and exponents: 10^8 * 10^-24 = 10^-16.

So 6.113e-16 meters.

Hmm, but none of the options are exactly 6e-16. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: 5.0223e-16 m.

Option D: 4.0655e-16 m.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate beta more accurately. Earlier I approximated sqrt(0.9775) as 0.9887. Let me compute that more precisely.

Calculate 0.9775: sqrt(0.9775).

I'll use a calculator approach. Let's think of sqrt(0.9775).

I know that 0.9887^2 = (approx) (0.98)^2 = 0.9604, but let me compute 0.9887^2.

0.9887 *0.9887:

0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.

But let me compute accurately:

0.9887^2 = (0.9800 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0087 + 0.0087^2.

0.9604 + 2*(0.98*0.0087) + 0.00007569.

0.9604 + 2*(0.008484) )= 0.9604 + 0.016968 = 0.977368, plus 0.00007569 → 0.97744369.

Hmm, but 0.9775 is a bit higher. So sqrt(0.9775) would be slightly higher than 0.9887.

Wait, 0.9775 is 0.9775.

Wait, perhaps 0.9887^2 is 0.9775 exactly? Well, let me compute 0.9887 *0.9887 precisely.

0.9887 * 0.9887:

Let me compute 9887 * 9887.

But perhaps an easier way: (a + b)^2 where a= 9800, b=87.

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator approach.

Wait, 0.9887 * 0.9887 = ?

Let me compute:

0.9887 * 0.9887.

= (0.98 + 0.0087) * (0.98 + 0.0087)
= 0.98² + 2 *0.98 *0.0087 + 0.0087²
= 0.9604 + 2*(0.008526) + 0.00007569
= 0.9604 + 0.017052 + 0.00007569
= 0.9604 + 0.01712769
= 0.97752769.

So 0.9887^2 ≈ 0.977528, which is very close to 0.9775. So beta is approximately 0.9887, so that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the product v * tau.

Wait, let me recompute v * tau.

v is approximately 0.9887c, which is 2.966e8 m/s.

tau is 2.057e-24 seconds.

So v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s → 2.966e8 * 2.057e-24 = (2.966 * 2.057) * 1e8 * 1e-24.

2.966 * 2.057 = let me compute this precisely.

2 * 2.057 = 4.114.

0.966 * 2.057 ≈ approx 0.966 *2 =1.932, 0.966 *0.057≈0.055 → total approx 1.987.

So total 4.114 +1.987=6.101.

So 6.101 * 1e-16 → 6.101e-16 meters.

So about 6.1e-16 m. But the options don't have this value.

Hmm, perhaps the initial approach is wrong. Maybe I shouldn't have used the production energy E_X as the total energy but considered something else.

Wait, another thought: the production energy is the energy at which the meson is produced, but does that affect the calculation? Or is the energy used to calculate gamma correct? I think so because the decay length depends on the lifetime and velocity, which are determined by the mass and decay width.

Wait, perhaps the formula should use the square of the decay width? No, I don't think so. The width Γ is the total decay width, which is the inverse of the mean lifetime.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the natural line width and used the formula with c and ħ correctly. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: The decay length can be calculated using the formula L = c * τ * v. So τ is ħ / (Γ), and v is beta c.

So L = c * (ħ / Γ) * beta.

So substituting, L = (beta) * ħ c / Γ.

Hmm, but ħ c is a known value. Let me remember that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

Wait, that's a useful constant. So ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, L = (beta) * (ħ c) / (Γ) ) → (beta) * (197.33 MeV·fm) / (Γ in MeV) ).

But wait, I need to convert fm to meters. 1 fm is 1e-15 m.

So, let's compute that.

beta ≈ 0.9887.

Gamma is 320 MeV.

So,

L = 0.9887 * (197.33 MeV·fm) / 320 MeV.

The MeV units cancel out.

So, (0.9887 * 197.33 ) / 320 → compute numerator.

0.9887 *197.33 ≈ 0.9887 *200 = 197.74 minus 0.9887*(2.67) → approx 197.74 – 2.65 ≈ 195.09.

So 195.09 fm / 320 → approx 0.6096 fm.

Wait, 0.6096 fm is 0.6096e-15 meters → 6.096e-16 meters.

Hmm, that's about 6.1e-16 m, same as before. But again, the options don't match this.

Wait, but according to this calculation, it's 6.096e-16 m, which is approximately 6.1e-16 m, but the options are 5e-16 and 4e-16.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in using ħ c. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, ħ c is approximately 197.327 MeV·fm. So,

L = (0.9887) * (197.327) / 320 → let's compute 0.9887 *197.327.

0.9887 * 200 = 197.74. But since 197.327 is 2.673 less than 200.

So 0.9887 * 197.327 → 0.9887*(200 -2.673) = 197.74 - (0.9887 *2.673).

0.9887 * 2.673 → approx 2.643.

So 197.74 -2.643= 195.097.

So 195.097 / 320 = approx 0.609678 fm → 0.609678e-15 m → 6.09678e-16 m.

Wait, but none of the options match this. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) 5.0223e-16 m → 5.02e-16.

B)4.0655e-15 m.

C)5.0223e-15 m.

D)4.0655e-16.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should include the factor of 1/c somewhere. Wait, in the formula for L, perhaps it's (ħ / (Γ c)) multiplied by something.

Wait, let me think again. The decay width Γ is given in MeV, which is energy. The lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. But in natural units, τ = ħ_bar / Γ, where ħ_bar is in MeV s.

Wait, but when you're calculating the decay length, which is a distance, you have to make sure the units are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the natural units approach where c=1 and ħ=1, then convert to meters.

Wait, in natural units, L = v * tau. v is in terms of c, and tau is in seconds.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach.

Let me think of the formula as L = (c * tau) * beta.

So, c is in m/s, tau in seconds, so c*tau is meters, multiplied by beta (dimensionless).

Alternatively, use the formula:

L = (beta c) * tau.

But that's the same as v * tau.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute beta and c*tau separately.

Wait, beta c for this particle is 0.9887 *3e8 m/s → approximately 2.966e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.057e-24 seconds.

So 2.966e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s = 6.103e-16 meters.

But again, the same result.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the gamma factor. Let me check that again.

E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV.

So E = gamma m c² → gamma = E/(m c²) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relativistic expression for lifetime. Because the lifetime in the particle's rest frame is tau_0 = ħ / Gamma. Then, the observed lifetime is gamma * tau_0.

Wait, that's another approach. Let me try that.

The proper lifetime tau_0 is ħ / Gamma.

Then, the observed lifetime tau is gamma * tau_0.

So L = v * tau = v * gamma * tau_0.

But v is beta c, so,

L = beta c * gamma tau_0.

But tau_0 is ħ / Gamma → so,

L = beta c gamma (ħ / Gamma).

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is correct. Because in the rest frame, the lifetime is tau_0 = ħ / Gamma.

Then, in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau_0.

So the decay length is v * (gamma tau_0) = beta c gamma tau_0.

Wait, but beta gamma is (v/c) * gamma → which is (gamma v)/c. Hmm, but gamma v/c = gamma beta.

Wait, I think another way to write beta gamma is gamma beta. So,

beta gamma = (gamma v)/c.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I should be using is L = c * tau * beta gamma.

Wait, because L = v * tau = (beta c) * tau.

And tau = gamma tau_0.

So L = beta c gamma tau_0.

But tau_0 is ħ / Gamma.

So L = beta c gamma (ħ / Gamma).

Wait, but in natural units, c=1 and ħ=1, so L = beta gamma / Gamma.

Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to compute using the formula L = (beta gamma) * (ħ c) / Gamma.

Wait, let me try that.

So,

beta gamma = (0.9887) * 6.6667 ≈ 6.611.

So,

beta gamma ≈6.611.

Then,

L = (6.611) * (197.33 MeV fm) / (320 MeV) → 6.611 *197.33 / 320 fm.

Calculating the numerator: 6.611 *197.33 ≈ approx 1307.6.

So 1307.6 /320 ≈4.086 fm.

Which is 4.086e-15 meters.

Wait, that's option B:4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but wait, that's 4.086e-15, but the option is about 4.065e-15.

Hmm, perhaps my approximation for beta gamma is a bit off.

Wait, let me compute beta gamma more accurately.

Beta =0.9887, gamma=6.66666667.

So beta * gamma =0.9887 *6.66666667 → let me compute.

0.9887 *6 =5.9322.

0.9887 *0.66666667≈0.9887 * (2/3) ≈0.6591.

So total approx 5.9322 +0.6591=6.5913.

So beta gamma≈6.5913.

So,

L=6.5913 *197.33 /320.

Compute 6.5913 *197.33.

6.5913 * 200 =1318.26.

But 197.33 is 2.67 less than 200.

So 6.5913 *197.33= 6.5913*(200-2.67)= 1318.26 - (6.5913 *2.67).

Compute 6.5913 *2.67:

6 *2.67=16.02.

0.5913 *2.67≈1.574.

Total≈17.594.

So 1318.26 -17.594≈1300.666.

So L=1300.666 /320 fm.

1300.666 / 320 → approx 4.0646 fm →4.0646e-15 m.

Which matches option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

Ah! So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but wait, in this approach, L is 4.0646e-15 m, which is option B.

But earlier, when I computed using velocity and tau directly, I got about 6e-16 m. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, I think I now see the mistake. Earlier, I used tau = ħ / Gamma, but perhaps I should have used the total decay width in the lab frame, which is different. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula incorporates the relativistic gamma factor.

Wait, so the proper mean lifetime is tau_0= ħ / Gamma. Then, in the lab frame, tau=gamma tau_0.

So the decay length is v * tau = beta c * gamma tau_0.

But tau_0 = ħ / Gamma → so,

L= beta c gamma (ħ / Gamma).

Which we can write as L = (beta gamma) (ħ c) / Gamma.

Because ħ c is in MeV fm, when Gamma is in MeV, the units work out.

So,

L = (beta gamma) * (197.33 MeV fm) / (Gamma in MeV).

So,

beta gamma = 0.9887 *6.6667 ≈6.591.

Gamma is 320 MeV.

So,

L =6.591 *197.33 /320 fm.

Which we calculated as approximately 4.0646 fm →4.0646e-15 meters.

Which matches option B.

So, the correct answer is option B:4.0655e-15 m.

To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the relativistic formula for the decay length:

\[
L = \beta \gamma \frac{\hbar c}{\Gamma}
\]

### Given Data:
- Production energy: \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Mass: \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \)
- Decay width: \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} \)

### Step 1: Calculate \(\beta\) and \(\gamma\)
1. **Relativistic factor \(\gamma\):**
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X c^2} = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667
   \]

2. **Velocity factor \(\beta\):**
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the decay width in natural units
The decay width \(\Gamma\) is given as \(320 \, \text{MeV}\). In natural units (\(c = \hbar = 1\)), the mean lifetime is:
\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the observed decay length
The observed decay length in the lab frame is:
\[
L = \beta \gamma \tau_0 = \beta \gamma \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Using \(\hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm}\), the formula becomes:
\[
L = \beta \gamma \frac{\hbar c}{\Gamma}
\]

Substitute the values:
- \(\beta \gamma = 0.9887 \times 6.6667 \approx 6.591\)
- \(\Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV}\)
- \(\hbar c = 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm}\)

\[
L = \frac{6.591 \times 197.33}{320} \, \text{fm}
\]

1. Compute the numerator:
   \[
   6.591 \times 197.33 \approx 1300.67
   \]

2. Divide by \(\Gamma\):
   \[
   L = \frac{1300.67}{320} \, \text{fm} \approx 4.0646 \, \text{fm}
   \]

Convert to meters:
\[
L = 4.0646 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The closest option is:
\[
\text{B) } 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{B}}
\]
