Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here about optical isomerism, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? They have chiral centers, I think. Let me go through each of the given compounds one by one.

The question lists four options, 1 to 4, and the choices are combinations of these. So, I need to determine which of these compounds exhibit optical isomerism.

Starting with compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected at the 1,1' position. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, the substituents are nitro groups and carboxylate ester groups. So, the structure has two benzene rings connected, and each has a nitro and a carboxylate ester group. The positions are 2 and 6 on each ring. Now, can this compound have stereoisomerism? Optical isomerism requires the presence of a chiral center or some form of stereogenic element. Alternatively, maybe it's about the possibility of cis-trans isomerism in the biphenyl rings.

Wait, biphenyl compounds can have different conformations. If the substituents are in positions that allow for different arrangements around the single bond between the two rings, that could lead to cis or trans isomerism. But wait, optical isomerism specifically refers to enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images. So, for that, there needs to be a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry.

Looking at compound 1, each ring has two substituents: a nitro and a carboxylate. If the substituents are all on the same side or opposite sides, maybe that's possible. But would that create a chiral center? Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me visualize it. The molecule is 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So the nitro groups are on the 6 positions of each ring, which are across from the connecting point (1,1'). The carboxylate groups are on the 2 positions, which are adjacent to the connecting point. So, on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are para positions relative to each other. Wait, but the two rings are connected at position 1,1', so the substituents at 2 and 6 are on the same ring.

Wait, maybe it's more about the arrangement of the substituents across the single bond. The two rings are connected, so the substituents on each ring can be either on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans) of the single bond. But does that lead to enantiomers or just geometric isomerism? Oh, wait, geometric isomerism is another form of stereoisomerism, but not optical isomerism. Or wait, no—geometric isomerism is about the arrangement of substituents around a double bond (cis-trans) or in a ring (like cyclohexane chairs). In biphenyls, the single bond allows for rotation, but sometimes the substituents are arranged in such a way that they can't rotate into a plane that makes them identical to their mirror image. So, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that creates a non-superimposable mirror image, then it would have optical isomerism.

In compound 1, the substituents are in specific positions. Each ring has two substituents: 6-nitro and 2-carboxylate. So, for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. Considering the biphenyl structure, the arrangement of substituents on each ring could lead to different configurations. But I'm not entirely sure if that creates a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry. Wait, if the substituents on both rings are mirror images of each other, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. Hmm, not sure. I'll come back to this after looking at the other compounds.

Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see. The formula would be something like CH3-C(OH)O-CO-OCH3. Wait, actually, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, structure-wise, the propanoate has three carbons: the first is the methyl group attached to the second, which has an OH and a COOCH3 group. So, structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-? No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but the 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-, but the 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So, it's CH3-CHOH-COOCH3? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but more accurately, it's CH3CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon, so the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. But wait, wait, the ester is methyl, so the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2(OH)
|
CH3

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Maybe it's (CH3)CO-OH with a hydroxyl on the adjacent carbon. Wait, no, for 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is HOCH2COOCH3, perhaps. So, that would be a three-carbon chain where the first carbon is the ester (CH3O-CO-), the second carbon has the OH, and the third is CH2. Wait, perhaps it's:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the HO is on the second carbon. Now, looking for chiral centers. The second carbon (the one with OH) is attached to three different groups: OH, CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Let me think. The structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the second carbon is CH2, which is connected to CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? No, that can't be. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

The propanoate is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. Wait, that's a better way. So, the three carbons are:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: C(OH)H-
Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So, structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. Now, looking for chiral centers. The second carbon has what attached? Let's see: the second carbon (the middle one) is connected to:

- One CH2OH group (from the first carbon)
- One CH2COOCH3 group (from the third carbon)
- Two H's? No, wait, each carbon in the chain is CH2 except for the middle one which has the OH. Wait, no, if it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, the middle carbon is CH2 with an OH. So, the middle carbon is connected to:

- CH2OH (the first carbon)
- CH2COOCH3 (the third carbon)
- Two H's? No, wait, that can't be. Wait, the middle carbon would have two CH2 groups attached? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

The molecule is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. No, because that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, the middle carbon (carbon 2) has an OH group. So, what's attached to carbon 2? Let's see:

- Carbon 1: CH3
- Carbon 3: COOCH3
- OH group
- And a hydrogen?

So, carbon 2 has four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. That makes it a chiral center. So, yes, this compound has a chiral center and thus can exhibit optical isomerism. So compound 2 does show optical isomerism.

Compound 3: benzophenone. That's a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl group. The structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. So, the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two phenyl groups. Now, can this molecule have optical isomerism? Well, optical isomerism requires a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry. But in benzophenone, the central carbon has two phenyl groups, an oxygen double bond, and a lone pair? Wait, no, the central carbon in benzophenone is the carbonyl carbon. Wait, no, the carbonyl is a double bond, so the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and a double bond oxygen. So, the structure is (Ph)2C=O.

Wait, but the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. So, it's sp2 hybridized. That means it's trigonal planar, so no, there's no chiral center here. Also, the molecule is symmetrical because the two phenyl groups are identical. So, benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers and isn't chiral itself. Hence, it won't exhibit optical isomerism.

Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is a di-ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So, fumarate would be the di-ester, with two ester groups. The structure is CH2CH2(CO2Me)2, but in the trans configuration. So, the structure is CH2=CH(CO2Me)2? Wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond in between. No, wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2CH2-COOH? No, wait, no, fumaric acid is (E)-HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So, the di-ester would be with two methyl esters on each end. So, the structure would be CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Wait, that's not right. Let me think again.

Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When converted to dimethyl fumarate, it's CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3? No, no. Wait, the structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the dimethyl ester would have each of the two COOH groups converted to COOCH3. So, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, the double bond is between the two central carbons. So, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, wait, wait, no. Let me get this right. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid: HO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–CO₂H. No, wait, no. Wait, that's maleic acid. No, wait, maleic acid is (Z) and fumaric is (E). Structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, no, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, where the double bond is between the two central carbons, and the substituents (the two COOH groups) are on opposite sides, making it the trans configuration.

So, the dimethyl ester would be MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe. So, the groups on each end are methyl esters, and the double bond in the middle is trans. Now, considering the possibility of optical isomerism. Well, for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it needs to have a chiral center or some form of asymmetry. Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral.

In dimethyl fumarate, the structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe. Each CH=CH group has substituents on both ends. Each end has a COOMe group. Now, looking at the substituents around the double bond. The molecule is symmetrical if the substituents on either end are the same. Wait, since both ends are COOMe and the double bond is symmetric, then the molecule is symmetrical, right? So the molecule would be identical on both sides of the double bond. Therefore, it's not chiral because it has a plane of symmetry. So, it wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but wait a second. Fumarate is the trans isomer. So, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Let me think about the structure again.

Structure: O
         ||
O-C-OCH3 - C - C - O-C-OCH3
         ||
         O

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it. The two ester groups are on either end of a double bond. The double bond is in the middle, trans. So, each ester group is on a different carbon. So, each of the CH=CH groups has an ester. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3   C=C    O-C-OCH3
|| 
O 

Wait, no, perhaps it's more like:

CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂, but with the substituents on opposite sides. Wait, no, the structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe. So, each CH has a COOMe group. Since the substituents on each end are the same, the molecule is symmetrical. So, it doesn't have a chiral center, and it's not chiral. Thus, dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, maybe I'm mistaken. Another possibility is that the molecule has a plane of symmetry along the double bond, making it achiral. Hence, no optical isomerism.

Now, let me go back to compound 1. I was a bit unsure about it earlier. So, the structure is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, it's a biphenyl with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2.

Now, the question is whether this molecule has a chiral center or a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral.

Looking at the substituents: each ring has a nitro group and a carboxylate. Are the substituents on each ring arranged in a way that allows for a chiral center? Well, each ring is a benzene ring with two substituents, but the positions are 2 and 6. Wait, on each ring, 2 and 6 are adjacent to the point of attachment (position 1). So, the nitro is at 6, which is across from position 1 (the connecting point). The carboxylate is at 2, which is adjacent to 1. So, for each ring, substituents are at 2 (carboxylate) and 6 (nitro), which are meta positions relative to each other on the same ring.

Now, considering the biphenyl structure, the way the two rings are connected can lead to different configurations. The substituents on each ring could be either on the same face (cis) or opposite faces (trans) relative to the bond connecting the rings. But would that create a chiral center?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry. Let me imagine the structure. The two rings are connected at position 1, each with substituents at 2 (carboxylate) and 6 (nitro). So, each ring has a nitro group opposite the connecting point and a carboxylate adjacent. Now, if the nitro groups on each ring are on the same face, and the carboxylate groups are on the same face, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged such that there's no symmetry, the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, but each ring is identical in terms of substituents. Each has a nitro and a carboxylate. So, if the substituents on both rings are arranged in the same way, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if they are arranged oppositely, perhaps that leads to asymmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the rings can rotate, allowing the substituents to change their positions. But in reality, the biphenyl rings can have fixed positions if hindered, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. Hmm, I'm not quite sure about this. Maybe I can think about whether the molecule has a center of inversion or a mirror plane.

Another approach: consider if any of the substituents are in a chiral environment. For example, if a substituent is attached to a carbon that's connected to four different groups, that would be a chiral center. But in this case, the substituents are on aromatic rings, which are flat and don't have chiral centers.

Wait, perhaps the molecule itself isn't chiral, but could it have some kind of axial chirality due to the biphenyl structure? Axial chirality refers to the chirality arising from the arrangement of substituents around a single bond, like in biphenyls. In such cases, the molecule can have axial stereoisomerism, leading to enantiomers.

So, in the case of compound 1, each ring has two substituents. If the substituents on the two rings are arranged in such a way that they can't be superimposed on their mirror images, then the molecule would be chiral and exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but for a molecule to have axial chirality, the two substituents on each ring must be different, and arranged in a way that creates a lack of symmetry. For example, in 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, the axial chirality depends on the arrangement of the substituents.

In compound 1, each ring has a nitro group and a carboxylate. The positions are 2 and 6 on each ring. So, for each ring, the nitro is at 6 and the carboxylate at 2. Now, considering the biphenyl structure, each ring can rotate relative to the other. The substituents can be on the same face (cis) or opposite faces (trans).

Wait, but in this case, since each ring has two substituents, perhaps the arrangement leads to a situation where the molecule can have two non-superimposable mirror images.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule does have axial chirality. Let me think: the biphenyl has two rings connected by a single bond. Each ring has two substituents. The substituents on each ring are in specific positions (2 and 6). So, when you look at each ring, the substituents are at positions that are adjacent to the connecting point (position 2) and diametrically opposite (position 6). So, arranging the substituents on each ring in such a way that their positions create a lack of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is similar to dinitrophenyl acetone or something like that. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is similar to a binaphthol, which is known to exhibit axial chirality.

Wait, for example, binaphthol has two naphthol groups connected, and if the hydroxyl groups are on different faces, it creates axial chirality.

In compound 1, the substituents on each ring are in positions that could lead to axial chirality. If the nitro and carboxylate groups on each ring are arranged in such a way that their positions on each ring make the molecule non-symmetrical, then it would be chiral.

Another approach: the molecular formula is the same, but the structure is different. So, for each compound, I need to assess whether it has a chiral center or an element of chirality such as axial chirality.

So, for compound 1, the substituents on each ring are in positions 2 and 6, which are meta to each other. Each ring has a nitro group and a carboxylate ester. Now, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that they are on the same face (cis) or different faces (trans), that could lead to different stereoisomers.

But whether this leads to optical isomerism depends on whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it's chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that it has a center of chirality. Let me think about the substituents: each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. If these substituents are arranged such that their positions relative to each other on each ring don't allow for a plane of symmetry, then the molecule could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps each ring's substituents are arranged in a way that their positions on each ring make the overall molecule chiral.

Wait, but without more details, it's a bit hard, but I think that this compound could exhibit optical isomerism because the substituents on each ring are positioned in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

But wait, I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about the molecule. Each ring has two substituents: nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2. The two rings are connected at position 1. The substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6 positions. If the substituents on each ring are in a way that their positions create a chiral arrangement, then the molecule would be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent on each ring is in a position that makes the molecule symmetric. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule would not be chiral.

Wait, perhaps each substituent in the molecule is in a position that makes the entire structure symmetrical. For example, if the substituents on both rings are mirror images of each other, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry.

But in this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2, which are symmetric with respect to the ring. So, perhaps the molecule as a whole is symmetrical, making it achiral.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Let me try to imagine it. If each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2, then looking from the connecting point (position 1), the nitro is opposite (position 6), and the carboxylate is next to it (position 2). So, for each ring, the substituents are arranged in a certain way. If the substituents on each ring are aligned in the same way relative to the connecting bond, the molecule could be symmetrical. But if they are opposite, it could lack symmetry.

Wait, but the two rings are connected in a way that their orientations can vary. So, maybe the substituents can be arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, leading to optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not chiral because the substituents are arranged in a symmetrical fashion. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same face and the carboxylates are on the same face, the molecule might be symmetrical. But if the substituents are arranged differently, maybe it's not.

Hmm, I'm not completely sure. Let me tentatively say that compound 1 does exhibit optical isomerism because the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a lack of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. But I'm not entirely confident.

So, putting it all together:

Compound 1: Think it has optical isomerism (chiral due to substituent arrangement).
Compound 2: Definitely has a chiral center, so yes.
Compound 3: No, because it's symmetrical and no chiral centers.
Compound 4: No, because it's symmetrical.

So, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1, 2, and 4? Wait, no. Wait, earlier I thought compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Let me check.

Wait, compound 4 is dimethyl fumarate, which is the trans di-ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer, so its ester would have the substituents on opposite sides of the double bond. But in that case, does the molecule have a center of symmetry? Let me think again. The structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe, with the substituents on opposite sides. So, each end is symmetrical. The molecule might have a center of symmetry because each substituent is mirrored on the other side. Hence, it is achiral, so no optical isomerism.

So, compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism. But wait, earlier I thought compound 1 might, but I'm not 100% sure. If 1 does, then the correct options would be 1 and 2, which would be option D (if the choices are A, B, C, D as given). But let me check the options.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2,4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

Wait, but according to my analysis, compounds 1 (if it's chiral) and 2 definitely are. So, if 1 is chiral, then the answer would include 1 and 2, which is option D.

But earlier, I was unsure about compound 1. Let me think again. Another approach: The presence of a chiral center is the main way to get optical isomerism. So, if compound 1 doesn't have a chiral center, then it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, in compound 1, all the substituents are on aromatic rings. Are there any chiral centers? Let me look for any carbon attached to four different groups. In the dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate, perhaps the central carbon connecting the two rings is connected to two rings and two ester groups. Wait, the structure is:

Ph–C–C–Ph

But wait, the central carbon is actually the one connecting the two phenyl rings. So, the central carbon is attached to two phenyl groups, two ester groups (or is that correct? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Ah, so the structure is two benzene rings connected at position 1,1'. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester (OOCR, where R is methyl) at position 2.

Each of those substituents is on the benzene rings; the central carbon is part of the biphenyl structure. So, the central atom is the carbon connecting the two benzene rings, but it's a single bond, so the structure is:

Ph–CH2–CH2–Ph? No, no. The biphenyl structure is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. So, the structure is Ph–Ph, connected at positions 1 and 1'. Each Ph has substituents at positions 2 and 6.

So, the two benzene rings are connected via a single bond. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2.

Now, the question is whether this creates a chiral center. Each ring is connected at position 1, and the substituents are at 2 (carboxylate) and 6 (nitro). So, the substituents on each ring are in a specific arrangement relative to the connecting bond.

Now, the biphenyl can have different configurations, like cis or trans, which could lead to axial chirality. So, axial chirality arises when there are two substituents on each of the two rings that are arranged in a way that creates a lack of symmetry.

In this case, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate. If the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the nitro and carboxylate are on the same face (cis) or opposite faces (trans), the molecule could have axial chirality.

Wait, but for axial chirality, the substituents on each ring must be on opposite sides relative to the connecting bond. So, if on each ring, the substituents are on the same face, the molecule would have a certain configuration. But if they're on opposite faces, that would be another configuration.

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe each ring has substituents that are not symmetrical, leading to a chiral molecule. Let me imagine the substituents on each ring. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. The positions 2 and 6 on each ring are across from each other relative to the connecting point.

So, the carboxylate is adjacent to the connecting point, and the nitro is across. So, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that their positions create a chiral environment, the molecule would be chiral.

I think that in this structure, the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has axial chirality. Hence, it would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism. Hence, the correct option is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality. Optical isomerism arises when a compound has a non-superimposable mirror image, typically due to a chiral center or axial chirality.

### Compound 1: Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate  
This compound consists of two benzene rings connected at the 1,1' position. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. The substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. The biphenyl structure allows for axial chirality, where the substituents on the two rings can create non-superimposable mirror images. Thus, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

### Compound 2: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  
The structure of this compound is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is attached to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and a hydrogen. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

### Compound 3: Benzophenone  
Benzophenone has the structure Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl carbon. The molecule is symmetrical, with identical phenyl groups on both sides of the carbonyl. Since there is no chiral center or asymmetry, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Compound 4: Dimethyl Fumarate  
Dimethyl fumarate has the structure CH2=C(COOCH3)2 in the trans configuration. The molecule is symmetrical because the substituents on both ends of the double bond are identical. This symmetry prevents the molecule from being chiral, and thus it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion  
Compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism due to their chiral nature. Compounds 3 and 4 are symmetrical and do not exhibit optical isomerism. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
