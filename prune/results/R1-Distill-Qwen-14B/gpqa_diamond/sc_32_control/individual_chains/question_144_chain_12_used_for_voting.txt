--- Reasoning Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of particle physics concepts. Let me take a deep breath and try to figure this out.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. I remember that mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are like unstable particles that don't exist for very long. So, the problem is asking about the mean decay distance of this meson.

The given values are:
- Production energy, E_X = 8 GeV
- Mass, m_X = 1.2 GeV
- Width, Γ_X = 320 MeV.

Hmm, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width, and from there, you can find the mean decay distance. Oh wait, but wait—I think the formula involves the uncertainty principle. So, the lifetime τ is inversely proportional to Γ. Yeah, something like τ ≈ ħ / Γ, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula.

Wait, no, another thought. The width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, but I might have that backwards. Let me think: since Γ is the total decay width, it's like the inverse of the lifetime. So, τ = ħ / Γ. Or wait, is it ħ divided by (Γ/2π)? Because I remember that the natural linewidth is Γ/(2π), but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach. The mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / (Γ_total). Because the decay width Γ is the energy uncertainty, and from uncertainty principle, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So Δt would be the lifetime, which is τ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I think the correct formula is τ = ħ / (Γ), but I'm not 100% certain. Or maybe it's τ = ħ/(Γ/2π), because when I see the relation, Γ = ħ/(τ) * (something). Let me think: the decay rate Γ is equal to ħ/(τ), so τ = ħ/(Γ). Or wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me get this right.

The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the formula Γ = ħ / τ. No, wait, Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the inverse lifetime. So Γ = ħ / τ. Thus, τ = ħ / Γ. Yes, that makes sense.

But wait, I've also heard about the natural width being Γ/(2π) when considering the Breit-Wigner distribution, but I'm not sure if that affects the lifetime. Hmm, perhaps for this problem, we can ignore that and proceed with Γ = ħ / τ.

Once we have the lifetime τ, how do we find the mean decay distance? Well, the mean decay distance L is the product of the velocity v and the lifetime τ. So L = v * τ.

But wait, another thought: since the particle is produced with some energy, we can find its velocity. Because the energy given is 8 GeV, which is much higher than its rest mass (1.2 GeV), so it must be moving relativistically. So, we can compute the velocity using the energy.

Alternatively, perhaps we can calculate the relativistic gamma factor γ, which is E/(m c²). But wait, E here is the total energy. So E = γ m c². Solving for γ: γ = E/(m c²). Let me plug in the numbers.

Wait, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Then, the velocity v is given by v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). Since γ is large, 1/γ² is small, so v ≈ c * (1 - (1/(2 γ²))), but maybe in this case, since γ is large, v is approximately c. So perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we can approximate v ≈ c. That would simplify things a lot.

So, L ≈ v * τ. And since v ≈ c, L = c * τ.

But τ is ħ / Γ. So putting it together, L = c * (ħ / Γ).

Wait, let me write that down:

L = c * (ħ / Γ).

So, I need to compute c * ħ divided by Γ.

But I have to make sure all the units are consistent. Let me think about the units.

ħ is Planck's constant over 2π. Its value is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

Wait, let me check the exact value: ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Yes. And c is the speed of light, about 3 × 10^8 m/s.

But Γ is given in MeV. So I need to convert Γ to GeV to match the units of ħ.

Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So, let me compute the numerator: c * ħ.

c = 3e8 m/s.

ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV s.

So, c * ħ = 3e8 m/s * 6.582e-25 GeV s = 3e8 * 6.582e-25 GeV m.

Wait, because (m/s) * (GeV s) ) = GeV m.

So 3e8 * 6.582e-25 = let's compute that.

3e8 is 3 * 10^8.

6.582e-25 is 6.582 * 10^-25.

Multiplying: 3 * 6.582 = 19.746, and 10^8 * 10^-25 = 10^-17.

So, 19.746e-17 GeV m.

Wait, no, wait, 3e8 *6.582e-25 = 3 * 6.582 × 10^(8-25) ) = 19.746 × 10^-17 GeV m.

So, c * ħ = 1.9746e-16 GeV m.

Now, divide by Γ which is 0.32 GeV.

So, L = (1.9746e-16 GeV m ) / (0.32 GeV) ) 

The GeV units cancel out.

So, 1.9746e-16 / 0.32 = ?

Let me compute 1.9746 / 0.32.

1.9746 ÷ 0.32.

0.32 * 6 = 1.92, which is close to 1.9746.

So 6.170625, because 0.32 * 6.170625 = 1.9746.

So 6.170625e-16 m.

Wait, but that's 6.17e-16 meters. Looking at the options:

Option D is 4.0655e-16 m.

Option A is 5.02e-16.

Hmm, none of the options are exactly 6e-16, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of c * ħ.

Wait, let me recompute c * ħ.

c = 3e8 m/s.

ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV s.

c * ħ = 3e8 m/s * 6.582e-25 GeV s.

Multiply numbers: 3e8 * 6.582e-25 = (3 *6.582) ) × 1e8 × 1e-25.

3 * 6.582 = 19.746.

1e8 * 1e-25 = 1e-17.

So 19.746e-17 GeV m.

Which is 1.9746e-16 GeV m.

Wait, no, 19.746e-17 is 1.9746e-16.

So, yes, correct.

Then, L = 1.9746e-16 GeV m / 0.32 GeV.

So 1.9746e-16 / 0.32 = (1.9746 / 0.32) e-16.

1.9746 ÷ 0.32 = let's compute:

0.32 * 6 = 1.92 → 6.0 → 1.92 remaining 0.0546.

0.0546 / 0.32 ≈ 0.170625.

So total ≈ 6.170625.

So L ≈ 6.1706e-16 meters.

Wait, but none of the options match that. The options are:

A) 5.0223e-16 m

B) 4.0655e-15 m

C)5.0223e-15 m

D)4.0655e-16 m

Hmm. So I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for the decay length. Did I miss a relativistic factor?

Wait, because if the particle is moving at a high speed, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. Wait, no—wait, actually, the lifetime τ I calculated is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame). Because the decay width Γ is intrinsic to the particle, so the mean lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ, which is in the rest frame. But when the particle is moving, the lifetime observed in the lab frame is longer by gamma (γ). So the observed lifetime is γ * τ.

Ah! That's where I went wrong. Because earlier, I used τ as the lifetime in the lab frame, but actually, the proper lifetime is τ0 = ħ / Γ. The lab frame lifetime is γ τ0.

So, the correct mean decay distance L = v * γ τ0.

Wait, but earlier I approximated v ≈ c, which is correct for high energies. So, combining these:

L = v * γ τ0.

But since v ≈ c, and γ is E/(m c²) = (8 GeV)/(1.2 GeV c²) → 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Wait, wait, no. Let's compute gamma correctly.

E is the total energy, so gamma is E/(m c²). Since E is 8 GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV/c², so gamma is (8 GeV)/(1.2 GeV/c² * c²) ) → 8/(1.2) → 6.6667.

So, gamma is about 6.6667.

So, τ = gamma * tau_0.

Tau_0 is ħ / Γ.

So, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma * ħ / (Γ).

So, L = v * tau = v * gamma * ħ / Γ.

But since v ≈ c, L ≈ c * gamma * ħ / (Γ).

So the formula now becomes L = (c * gamma * ħ) / Γ.

Wait, but let's recalculate with this correction.

So, let's compute each part.

Gamma is 6.6667.

c is 3e8 m/s.

Gamma * ħ: 6.6667 * 6.582e-25 GeV s.

Wait, wait, let me be precise.

Wait, ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So, gamma * ħ = 6.6667 * 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Compute 6.6667 * 6.582.

6 *6.582 = 39.492, 0.6667 *6.582≈4.388. So total ≈ 43.88.

So, 43.88e-25 GeV·s.

Then, multiply by c (3e8 m/s):

(c * gamma * ħ) = (3e8 m/s) * (43.88e-25 GeV s) = 3e8 * 43.88e-25 GeV m.

Compute 3e8 * 43.88e-25 = 3 *43.88 × 1e8 × 1e-25 = 131.64 × 1e-17 = 1.3164e-15 GeV m.

Then, divide by Γ, which is 0.32 GeV.

So, L = 1.3164e-15 GeV m / 0.32 GeV = (1.3164 /0.32 )e-15 m.

Compute 1.3164 /0.32.

0.32 *4 = 1.28 → 4.0, with 0.0364 left.

0.0364 /0.32 ≈ 0.11375.

So, 4.11375.

So, L ≈4.11375e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is close. Hmm. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the gamma * ħ product.

Let me compute 6.6667 * 6.582e-25 precisely.

6.6667 * 6.582 = ?

Let me compute 6 *6.582 =39.492, 0.6667 *6.582 ≈4.388.

So, total is 39.492 +4.388=43.88 exactly?

Wait, 0.6667 multiplied by 6.582.

Let me compute 6.582 * 0.6667.

6.582 * 2/3 is approximately 4.388.

So, 43.88e-25 GeV s.

Hmm.

So, c * gamma * ħ = 3e8 m/s * 43.88e-25 GeV s = 3e8 *43.88e-25 GeV m.

3e8 is 3 * 1e8.

43.88e-25 is 4.388e-24.

So 3 * 4.388 =13.164.

1e8 * 1e-24 =1e-16.

So, 13.164e-16 GeV m.

Wait, no, wait: 3e8 *43.88e-25 = 3e8 *43.88e-25 = (3 *43.88) ) * 1e8 * 1e-25 = 131.64 * 1e-17 = 1.3164e-15 GeV m.

So, when I divide by 0.32 GeV, I get 1.3164e-15 / 0.32 = 4.11375e-15 m.

But the options have B as 4.0655e-15 m and D as 4.0655e-16 m.

Hmm, not exact. Perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, maybe I can approach this using the relation between the mean decay length and the particle's properties.

Another formula I've heard of is the decay length L = c * (ħ / Γ) * (E/mc²).

Wait, that's (c * ħ / Γ) multiplied by gamma (E/mc²). So, that would be L = (c * ħ * gamma ) / Γ.

Which is what I did earlier. So, same as before.

Wait, perhaps more precise calculation is needed. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

gamma = E/(m c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666666... So, 6.6666666667.

Now, gamma * ħ = 6.6666666667 * 6.582e-25.

So:

6 *6.582 =39.492.

0.6666666667 *6.582 = ?

0.6666666667 is 2/3.

So 2/3 *6.582 = (2 *6.582)/3 =13.164/3 ≈4.388.

So, 39.492 +4.388=43.88.

So, gamma * ħ =43.88e-25 GeV s.

Now, c is 299,792,458 m/s. But for approximation, perhaps I used 3e8 m/s. Let me use the precise value.

c = 2.99792458e8 m/s.

Compute c * gamma * ħ:

c = 2.99792458e8 m/s.

So, 2.99792458e8 *43.88e-25 GeV s.

= 2.99792458e8 *43.88e-25 GeV m.

But 2.99792458e8 is approximately 3e8.

Wait, let me compute 2.99792458e8 *43.88e-25.

Expressed as:

2.99792458e8 = 2.99792458 ×1e8.

Multiply by 43.88e-25=4.388e-24.

So:

2.99792458 ×4.388 ×1e8 ×1e-24.

Compute 2.99792458 ×4.388.

Approximately, 3 *4.388=13.164, but let's be precise.

2.99792458 *4.388.

Compute:

2.99792458 *4 = 11.99169832.

2.99792458 *0.388= approx 1.157.

Wait, 0.3 *2.99792458=0.899377374.

0.08 *2.99792458=0.239833966.

0.008 *2.99792458=0.023983397.

Adding them: 0.899377374 +0.239833966 =1.13921134 +0.023983397 =1.16319474.

So total is 11.99169832 +1.16319474 ≈13.15489306.

So, 13.15489306 × 1e8 ×1e-24 =13.15489306 ×1e-16 =1.315489306e-15 GeV m.

So, c * gamma * ħ =1.315489306e-15 GeV m.

Divide by Γ=0.32 GeV.

L = (1.315489306e-15 GeV m) / (0.32 GeV) = (1.315489306 / 0.32) e-15 m.

1.315489306 ÷0.32.

0.32 *4 =1.28. Subtract 1.28 from 1.315489 → 0.035489.

0.035489 /0.32 ≈0.1109.

So, 4.1109e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Close but not exactly the same. So perhaps I made an error in the values of constants.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should use the full expression without approximating v as c. Because if gamma is 6.6667, maybe v is a bit less than c.

Wait, let's compute v more accurately.

v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Gamma is 6.6667, so 1/gamma² is 1/(44.4444) ≈0.0225.

sqrt(1-0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So, v ≈ 0.9887 c.

Hmm, perhaps using v = 0.9887 c would make the calculation more precise.

So, let me recalculate L = v * gamma * tau_0.

tau_0 = ħ / Γ = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-25 s.

Wait, no: tau_0 is ħ / Γ, which is 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582 /0.32 )e-25 s.

6.582 /0.32 = 20.56875.

So, tau_0 =20.56875e-25 s =2.056875e-24 s.

Then, gamma is 6.6667, so the lab frame lifetime tau = gamma * tau_0 =6.6667 *2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 6.6667 *2.056875e-24.

6 *2.056875e-24=1.234125e-23.

0.6667 *2.056875e-24 ≈1.37125e-24.

Sum: 1.234125e-23 +1.37125e-24 =1.37125e-23 +1.234125e-23= 2.60535e-23 s.

Then, velocity v =0.9887 c =0.9887 *3e8 m/s ≈2.9661e8 m/s.

So, L= v * tau = 2.9661e8 m/s * 2.60535e-23 s.

Multiply:

2.9661e8 *2.60535e-23 = (2.9661 *2.60535) )e(8-23) = (approx 7.735)e-15 m.

Wait, wait, 2.9661 *2.60535 ≈ let me compute.

2 *2.60535=5.2107.

0.9661 *2.60535≈2.516.

So, total approx 5.2107 +2.516 =7.7267.

So, 7.7267e-15 m.

Wait, that's about 7.7e-15 m, which is way larger than the options, so that can't be right. So perhaps I messed up the calculation steps.

Wait, no—another approach. The formula for the mean decay length is L = (c * gamma * ħ) / (Γ * beta c), where beta is v/c.

Wait, maybe I should use beta correctly. Let me think again.

The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau_0. The velocity is beta c. So, the mean path is L = beta c * gamma tau_0.

Which can be written as L = beta gamma c tau_0.

But tau_0 is ħ / (Γ), so:

L = beta gamma c (ħ / Γ).

But beta gamma is equal to (v/c) * gamma.

Wait, since beta = v/c, and gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta²).

But another approach: since gamma =1/ sqrt(1 - beta²), so beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

We can compute beta gamma: beta gamma = gamma * beta = gamma * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) = sqrt( (gamma²)(1 -1/gamma²) )) = sqrt(gamma² -1).

So, beta gamma = sqrt(gamma^2 -1).

In our case, gamma is 6.6667, so gamma² is 44.4444. gamma² –1 is 43.4444. sqrt(43.4444)=6.588.

So, beta gamma ≈6.588.

So, L = (beta gamma) * (c ħ) / Γ.

So, c ħ is 3e8 m/s *6.582e-25 GeV s = 1.9746e-16 GeV m.

Wait, 3e8 *6.582e-25 = (3 *6.582) )e(8-25) )=19.746e-17=1.9746e-16.

So, L = (6.588) * (1.9746e-16 GeV m) / (0.32 GeV).

Compute 6.588 *1.9746e-16 = ?

6 *1.9746=11.8476.

0.588 *1.9746 ≈1.155.

Total ≈11.8476 +1.155=13.0026.

So, 13.0026e-16 GeV m /0.32 GeV = (13.0026 /0.32 )e-16 m.

13 ÷0.32 =40.625.

So, 40.625e-16 m =4.0625e-15 m.

Wait, that's about 4.0625e-15 m, which is very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.

Ah! So that's the correct approach. So the answer is B.

Wait, but why did my earlier approach using gamma and beta not yield the correct result? I think I must have messed up the steps earlier.

So, putting it all together, the correct formula is L = (beta gamma) * (c ħ) / (Γ).

And beta gamma is sqrt(gamma^2 -1). So, that gives the correct result.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we start by using the relationship between the decay width \( \Gamma \), the mean lifetime \( \tau \), and the relativistic effects. The mean decay distance is given by:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau = \beta c \cdot \gamma \tau_0
\]

where:
- \( \tau_0 = \hbar / \Gamma \) is the proper lifetime (lifetime in the rest frame of the particle),
- \( \gamma = E / (m c^2) \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = v / c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light.

### Step 1: Compute \( \tau_0 \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \) is calculated as:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \), we find:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

Given \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \), we find:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \beta \)
The velocity \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \), we calculate:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.4444}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( \beta \gamma \)
The product \( \beta \gamma \) is:

\[
\beta \gamma = \gamma \cdot \beta = 6.6667 \cdot 0.9887 \approx 6.588.
\]

### Step 5: Compute \( L \)
The mean decay distance \( L \) is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

Substituting \( \beta \gamma = 6.588 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau_0 = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \), we calculate:

\[
L = 6.588 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24})
\]

First, compute \( 6.588 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \):

\[
6.588 \cdot 3 = 19.764 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 19.764 \times 10^8 = 1.9764 \times 10^9.
\]

Now, multiply by \( 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \):

\[
L = 1.9764 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = (1.9764 \cdot 2.056875) \times 10^{-15}.
\]

Compute \( 1.9764 \cdot 2.056875 \):

\[
1.9764 \cdot 2 = 3.9528, \quad 1.9764 \cdot 0.056875 \approx 0.1125.
\]

Adding these:

\[
3.9528 + 0.1125 = 4.0653.
\]

Thus:

\[
L \approx 4.0653 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
