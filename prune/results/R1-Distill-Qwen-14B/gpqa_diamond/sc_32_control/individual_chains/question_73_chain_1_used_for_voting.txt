Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, relativistic speeds—so I think that means I need to use special relativity equations. Let me read the question again.

The problem states: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. What's their relative speed and the total energy of the system?

The options are A to D. I need to find which one is correct.

First, I think I should tackle the relative speed part. Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as in classical mechanics because of the addition formula. Oh right, the relativistic velocity addition formula is different. The formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just subtract their speeds.

Wait, wait. Wait. So the astronauts are moving in the same direction. So one is moving at 0.6c and the other at 0.5c. So the relative speed from the perspective of the 2m astronaut (0.6c) would be the difference between their speeds. Wait, but which one is which?

Wait, no. Let me think. I think I should compute the relative speed of the second astronaut (3m, moving at 0.5c) as seen from the frame of the first astronaut (2m, moving at 0.6c).

So, u is the speed of the 3m astronaut in the lab frame (0.5c), and v is the speed of the 2m astronaut in the lab frame (0.6c). Wait no, wait. Wait, the relative speed is the speed of one as seen from the other. So, if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, then from A's perspective, B's speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Wait, wait. Wait, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)), where u is the speed of the object you're observing, and v is the speed of your own frame relative to the lab.

Wait, no. Let's get this right. Let me clarify: If I'm in frame S, moving at velocity v relative to frame S', then the velocity u' of an object in S' is given by u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

So here, astronaut A (2m) is moving at 0.6c in the lab frame. So from astronaut A's frame, what is the speed of astronaut B (3m) moving at 0.5c in the lab? So in this case, u (the speed in the lab) is 0.5c, and v is the speed of A's frame, which is 0.6c.

So plugging into the formula: u' = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Calculating numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. So the numerator is -0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So u' = (-0.1c) / 0.7 = approximately -0.1429c, which is about -0.14c. Wait, but speed is a magnitude, but since the direction is negative, it means astronaut B is moving in the opposite direction relative to A. Wait, but both are moving in the same direction in the lab frame, so relative to A, B would be moving slower. Wait, but according to the calculation, the relative speed is about 0.14c in the opposite direction? Or is it the magnitude?

Wait, maybe I should think about the absolute value for speed. So the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 + (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²)) because when the speeds are in the same direction, the formula's denominator is 1 + (u v)/(c²). Wait, wait, no, I think I messed up the formula.

Wait, I should double-check the relativistic velocity addition formula. The correct formula is u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the object in the lab frame, and v is the velocity of the moving frame (A's frame) relative to the lab.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The lab frame is S, and the moving frame is S', which is moving at velocity v (0.6c) relative to S. So, from S' perspective, the astronaut B (u=0.5c) would have velocity u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

So u = 0.5c, v = 0.6c.

So u' = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Which is (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 = approximately -0.1429c.

So the relative speed is about 0.14c in the negative x-direction, but since speed is scalar, the magnitude is 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c.

Now, the second part: the total energy of the system.

The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Remember, relativistic energy E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

First, calculate each astronaut's energy.

Astronaut 1: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says 5 mc².

So putting this together, the relative speed is 0.14c, and total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for gamma2.

Gamma2: (0.5c)^2 is 0.25 c², so 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660, so 1/0.8660 is approximately 1.1547. So 1.1547 * 3m = 3.464 m. So yes, 5.964 in total.

So the options: option C says v_rel =0.14c, E=5.96 mc². That's correct. So the answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to calculate the relative speed of the second astronaut (moving at \( 0.5c \)) as seen from the frame of the first astronaut (moving at \( 0.6c \)):

\[
u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u = 0.5c \) (velocity of the second astronaut in the lab frame),
- \( v = 0.6c \) (velocity of the first astronaut in the lab frame).

Substituting the values:
\[
u' = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.14c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the magnitude of the relative speed is \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut:
- Mass: \( 2m \),
- Velocity: \( 0.6c \),
- \( \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25 \),
- Energy: \( E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2 \).

#### For the second astronaut:
- Mass: \( 3m \),
- Velocity: \( 0.5c \),
- \( \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547 \),
- Energy: \( E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2 \).

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5.96mc^2 \)**.
