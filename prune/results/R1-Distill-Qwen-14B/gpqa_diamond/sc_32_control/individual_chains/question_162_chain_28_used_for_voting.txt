Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and calculating the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's try to think this through step by step.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) * (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because dx and dy are involved. So the space here is 2D, but I'm not sure if it's flat or curved. The denominator looks like 4 minus (x squared plus y squared), so that's 4 - (x² + y²). The numerator is 32. So the entire coefficient is 32 divided by (4 - x² - y²).

I remember that in general relativity, the area of a surface in a curved space depends on the metric. For a two-dimensional surface, the area can be found by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor, but wait, no—actually, for the area element, it's sqrt(g_xx g_yy - g_xy²) dx dy. But in this case, since the metric is diagonal (no cross terms), it's just sqrt(g_xx * g_yy) dx dy. But here, since g_xx equals g_yy, that would be g_xx times dx dy.

Wait, let's think: the metric tensor is diagonal, so the area element dA is sqrt(g_{xx} g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2}) dx dy. But since g_{xy}=0, it's just sqrt(g_{xx} g_{yy}) dx dy. And since g_{xx} = g_{yy} = (32)/(4 - x² - y²), the area element becomes sqrt[(32/(4 - x² - y²))^2 ] dx dy. So that's (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

Wait, but 32 is a number. So dA = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

Wait, but to find the area, I need to integrate dA over the region where the metric is defined. So what's the region here? The denominator is 4 - x² - y². So 4 - x² - y² must be positive because otherwise, the metric would be undefined or have imaginary values. So 4 - (x² + y²) > 0 implies x² + y² <4. So the region is the interior of a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

Ah, so the area is over the disk of radius 2. So the area A would be the integral over x and y where x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but that integral looks a bit tricky. Let's change to polar coordinates because it's symmetric in x and y. So let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy becomes r dr dθ. The denominator 4 - r².

So the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Since the integrand doesn't depend on θ, we can separate the integrals. The θ integral from 0 to 2π is 2π. So,

A = 2π * ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute that integral. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r, so -du/2 = r dr.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes:

∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr = 32 ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u) * (-du/2) )

Which is 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (from u=4 to 0) (1/u) du.

But the integral of 1/u is ln|u|, so:

32 * (-1/2) [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, wait, let's compute this correctly. Wait, the substitution:

∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr = 32 ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) )

Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2 r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So the integral becomes:

32 ∫ (r dr)/(u) = 32 ∫ (-du/2) / u = -32/(2) ∫ (du/u) ) = -16 ∫ (du/u)

The limits when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes:

-16 [ ∫ from u=4 to u=0 (du/u) ) ]

Which is -16 [ ln(u) evaluated from 4 to 0 ].

But ln(0) is negative infinity. So ln(0) - ln(4) = -infinity - ln4. So the integral becomes -16 [ (-∞ - ln4) ] = -16*(-∞) which is positive infinity.

Wait, but wait. The integral ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u) du is the same as ∫ (from 4 to 0) du/u = ∫ (from 0 to4) du/u with a negative sign. So ∫ from 4→0 1/u du = - ∫ from 0→4 (1/u) du = - [ ln4 - ln0 ].

Wait, ln0 is negative infinity, so ln4 - ln0 is ln4 + ∞, which is ∞. So the integral becomes - ( ∞ ), which is negative infinity. Then multiply by -16: (-16) * ( - ∞ ) → +∞.

So the area A = 2π * (+∞) = +infinity. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, let me recheck the substitution:

Original integral after substitution: ∫ (32 r dr)/(4 - r²) = 32 ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) = 32 ∫ (-du/2)/u → 32*(-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du → -16 ∫ (1/u) du.

Now, the integral from r=0 to r=2 is the same as u from4 to 0. So the integral is:

-16 [ ∫ from4 to0 (1/u) du ] = -16 [ (ln0 - ln4) ].

But ln0 is minus infinity, so this is: -16 [ (-inf - ln4) ] → -16*(-inf - something finite) → -16*(-inf) → positive infinity.

So the area integral is 2π multiplied by positive infinity, which is infinity. So the area is infinite.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere—oh, maybe I'm confusing the terms. A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? Does that have a finite or infinite area?

Wait, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²)(dx² + dy²). Hmm, let me think about the form of metrics in hyperbolic space. I remember that the metric for hyperbolic space in 2D can be written in various forms. For example, in Poincaré coordinates, the metric is ds² = (dr² + dz²)/z², but that's for the half-plane model. Alternatively, in the Poincaré disk model, the metric is ds² = 4/(1 - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate in the disk.

Wait, in the disk model, the radius of the disk is the same as the curvature radius. The curvature is negative, and the disk has a radius of R, which is related to the curvature. So the total area of the hyperbolic plane is infinite, which makes sense because it's a non-compact space with infinite extent.

Wait, but our metric here is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So the denominator is 4 - x² - y², so the domain is x² + y² <4, which is a disk of radius 2. So the area we computed is infinite, so the area of this pseudosphere (if this is a model of hyperbolic space) would be infinite.

But wait, the question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe the pseudosphere is a different kind of surface. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to realize that the area is infinite because the integral diverges.

Looking back at the options, option D is +infinity. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but why is the area infinite? Because when you integrate the area element over the entire disk, you get an infinite result. So the answer must be D.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional curved space. To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\), we need to integrate the area element \(dA\) over the region where the metric is defined. The area element in this metric is:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The region of integration is determined by the condition \(4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0\), which corresponds to the interior of a circle of radius 2 in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. Converting to polar coordinates (\(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\)), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area \(A\) is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral over \(\theta\) from \(0\) to \(2\pi\) gives a factor of \(2\pi\), so:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, make the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), which gives \(du = -2r \, dr\) or \(r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du\). The limits of integration change accordingly: when \(r = 0\), \(u = 4\), and when \(r = 2\), \(u = 0\). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_4^0 \frac{-\frac{1}{2}}{u} \, du = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral of \(\frac{1}{u}\) is \(\ln|u|\), so:

\[
-16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \left[\ln(0) - \ln(4)\right].
\]

Since \(\ln(0) = -\infty\), this becomes:

\[
-16 \left[-\infty - \ln(4)\right] = +\infty.
\]

Thus, the area \(A\) diverges to infinity:

\[
A = 2\pi \cdot (+\infty) = +\infty.
\]

This result reflects the fact that the pseudosphere, as modeled by this metric, has infinite area. Therefore, the correct answer is:
