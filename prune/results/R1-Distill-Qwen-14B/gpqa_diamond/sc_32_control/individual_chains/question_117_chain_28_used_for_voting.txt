Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism... that's when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? So they have chiral centers or some sort of stereogenic elements.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to determine which show optical isomerism. Let's go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, biphenyl rings connected by a single bond. I think when two phenyl groups are connected by a single bond, the molecule can have a plane of symmetry if the substituents are in certain positions. But in this case, the substituents are at positions 2 and 2', which are para to the connecting bond. Wait, no, actually, if it's 6,6', so the nitro groups are at the 6 positions of each phenyl ring. The main chain is the biphenyl. So the question is, does this molecule have a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are in positions that allow for a plane of symmetry, then it might not be chiral. But wait, the substituents are on each ring, so let me visualize: each phenyl has a COOCH3 group at position 2 and a nitro group at position 6. The biphenyl is 1,1', meaning the two phenyl rings are connected at position 1. So, the molecule would have substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Hmmm, maybe. Wait, if the molecule has a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry, then it might not be chiral. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the substituents create a chiral center, but wait, in biphenyls, the substituents can create a situation where the molecule is non-planar and has a chiral axis or something. Wait, no, biphenyls themselves can have hindered rotation, so if the substituents are in such a way that the arrangement around the bond is not symmetric, they can lead to optical isomerism. But wait, I think biphenyl compounds with substituents in positions that don't allow for a plane of symmetry can be chiral. Let me think, for example, if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical. So if 6,6' are nitro and 2,2' are COOCH3, the arrangement could be such that each phenyl has two substituents, but are the substituents arranged symmetrically? Each ring has a nitro at 6 and COOCH3 at 2. Wait, each ring would have the same substituents but in different positions relative to each other. Hmm, not sure. Maybe this molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry because the substituents on each ring are not mirror images. Wait, the 2 and 6 positions on a benzene ring are meta to each other. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2. Are these positions symmetric? I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe the molecule is symmetrical, so it would not exhibit optical isomerism. Or perhaps the arrangement is such that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. I'm not certain about this one. Maybe I should come back to it.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH2OH. Wait, no, wait. Propanoate would be CH2CH2COOCH3. But 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Or wait, is it CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Wait, wait, no. Propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HO-CH2-COOCH3? Wait, no, because propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that would make the structure HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the structure is a three-carbon chain with the hydroxyl on the second carbon and the ester group on the third. Now, can this compound have a chiral center? Let's see: The second carbon (the one with hydroxyl) is connected to four different groups. Let's see: the groups attached to the second carbon would be -OH, the adjacent CH2 (from the first carbon), the adjacent COOCH3 (from the third carbon), and a hydrogen. Wait, wait, the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3? No, wait. Wait, maybe I'm misnaming it. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate: propanoate is CH2CH2COO- (if I number from the COO group as position 1). So position 2 is the middle CH2. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? So the structure would be:

O
|
COOCH3 is on the third carbon. So the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. Wait, but the second carbon would be connected to: CH2(OH), a CH2 group on either side, and a hydrogen. Wait, wait, no. Let me draw it out. The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the second carbon (the middle one) is CH2(OH), the first is CH3, middle is CH2OH, and the third is COOCH3. So the middle carbon is CH2OH. Wait, but that would be a CH2 group, so the attached groups are: two CH2 groups (left and right), an OH, and a hydrogen? No, wait, the middle carbon is CH2OH. So the groups are CH3 (from the first carbon), CH2OH (the same carbon?), wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, which would make the middle carbon CH(OH). Wait, that's more likely. So the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In that case, the middle carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another hydrogen (from CH). So four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So yes! That would make it a chiral center. So this molecule has a chiral center, meaning it can exhibit optical isomerism. So compound 2 can show optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. That's a molecule with two phenyl groups attached to a ketone. Structure is Ar-CO-Ar, where Ar is a phenyl group. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. Now, does this have any chiral centers or elements of asymmetry? No, because the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's a carbonyl group. The structure is symmetric because both phenyl groups are the same. So there's a plane of symmetry between the two phenyl groups. So no, benzophenone doesn't have optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the diester of maleic acid. Structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, fumarate is (Z)-butenedioic acid's diester. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, more accurately, it's CH2CH2 where the two CH2 groups are each attached to COOCH3, but with a double bond in between. Wait, no: maleic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. But wait, no, wait: maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, and fumarate is the diester, so it would be CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
COOCH3

Wait, no, the double bond is between the two middle carbons. So, it's CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, wait, the correct structure is CH2CH2 where each CH has a COOCH3 group. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the diester would be O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of the CH=CH. So the structure is CH2=CH with each CH connected to OCOOCH3. So the molecule is: 

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no, wait. Fumarate is an unsaturated diacid. So dimethyl fumarate would have two methyl ester groups on a double bond. So structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, wait, each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So it's CH2=CH with each CH attached to a COOCH3. So the structure is (CH2COOCH3)2C=CH2? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. No, wait, the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So the two COOCH3 groups are on the same carbon (the same CH group), while the other CH2 is on the other side of the double bond. So the molecule is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, that can't be right because the double bond is between two carbons. So, each of those two carbons would have substituents. So the correct structure is:

O
||
C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(COOCH3)
|
O
||
Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. No, that's not possible because each CH can only have a certain number of bonds. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 and another COOCH3 group? No, wait, fumarate is (E)-butenedioate.

Wait, let me get this straight. Fumarate is the diester of maleic acid. Maleic acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, no, wait, maleic acid is HO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂H. So, the diester would have two ester groups: OMe instead of the OH. So the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 attached to each end of the CH=CH.

So the structure is CH₂=CH with each CH having a COOCH3 group. So it's (CH₂COOCH3)₂C=CH₂? No, wait, no, the structure is (COOCH3)₂C=CH₂? No, that can’t be right. Alternatively, each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group attached.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂(COOCH3) with a double bond, but that can’t be right. Oh wait, no: the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂. So each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group attached. So, the structure is:

    O
    ||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2=C
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the two COOCH3 groups are on each of the two carbons in the double bond. So, each CH has a COOCH3 group. So the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂(COOCH3), but with a double bond. No, wait, no, because that would be CH₂(COOCH3)-CH₂(COOCH3) with a double bond, which would be CH₂=CH with each CH having COOCH3 groups. So each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 substituent. So the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). That's correct.

So, in this structure, the two carbons in the double bond each have two substituents: COOCH3. So, the molecule is (E)- or (Z)-configured. But for optical isomerism, we need a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry. Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, are there any chiral centers? No, because the double bond's configuration (E or Z) relates to geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism. Wait, or is there a possibility of a chiral center here?

Wait, no, because each of the two carbons in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups and a double bond. Wait, no, each has one COOCH3 and a double bond. So, each carbon in the double bond is connected to two substituents besides the double bond. Hmm. So the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). So each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group? Wait, no, perhaps each is connected to two COOCH3 groups? No, wait, the formula is C4H2O4 (if it's (COOCH3)2CH=CH2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (COOCH3)2C=CH2. Hmm, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's (COOCH3)CH2-CH2(COOCH3), but that's for succinate, not fumarate.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think differently. Fumarate is a diene, so the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So each of the two CH groups in the double bond has a COOCH3 substituent. But that would make each of those CH groups have three substituents: the double bond, a COOCH3, and a CH3? No, wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but that would imply that each CH has two COOCH3 groups, which isn't possible because each CH can only have three substituents (since it's a tetrahedral carbon). Wait, no, because the double bond is between two carbons, each of which has two substituents besides the double bond. Oh wait, each of the two carbons in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups and a single bond to another carbon. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-OCH3 connected to each end of the double bond. So the molecule is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, that would give each carbon in the double bond two COOCH3 groups. So each carbon would have a COOCH3, another COOCH3, and a double bond. That would make each carbon have three substituents (each COOCH3, the double bond, and perhaps a hydrogen or another substituent). Hmm, perhaps that's the case. So each of those carbons would have two COOCH3 groups, a double bond, and a hydrogen. So, for each carbon, the substituents would be COOCH3, COOCH3, H, and the double bond. Wait, but that would make them trigonal planar, so no, that's not possible. Hmm, maybe I should think about this differently.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH with each CH having a COOCH3 group. So, each CH is attached to one COOCH3. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, but that would require each CH to have two COOCH3 groups, which isn't possible. So perhaps the structure is (COOCH3)2CH=CH2. But then, the double bond is between the two central carbons. So, each of those carbons has two COOCH3 groups. But that would leave each carbon with four substituents: two COOCH3, one double bond, and perhaps a hydrogen. Wait, but that would require the double bond to be between two carbons each bearing two COOCH3 groups, which would make each of those carbons have three substituents: two COOCH3 and a double bond. So each would have a trigonal planar arrangement, which is possible. But in that case, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Because the two COOCH3 groups on each side would mirror each other. So in that case, the molecule would not exhibit optical isomerism. But wait, I'm not sure because the configuration (E or Z) could affect chirality.

Wait, no, the E and Z configurations are about geometric isomerism, not optical. For optical isomerism, you need a chiral center or a planar chirality, like in biphenyls. Alternatively, if the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, it might be chiral.

Wait, but dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. Maleate and fumarate are geometric isomers (cis and trans). But do they have chiral centers? No, because each carbon in the double bond is connected to two identical groups. Wait, for example, in fumarate (the trans isomer), each carbon has a COOCH3 group on opposite sides. But, without a chiral center, the molecule itself isn't chiral. Wait, but wait, maybe in fumarate, the molecule is not chiral. Because the substituents on each carbon are the same. So each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups and a double bond. So no, no chiral centers. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism. Or does it? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between geometric isomerism and optical isomerism. Because I thought that for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or some other element of chirality, like a plane of asymmetry.

Wait, another approach: in dimethyl fumarate, is there any possibility of a chiral center? Let's see, each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two COOCH3 groups and a double bond. So each of those carbons has two identical groups (two COOCH3), a double bond, and perhaps a hydrogen. So, no, the carbons in the double bond are not chiral centers because they don't have four different substituents. So, no chiral centers. So, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but this conflicts with what I thought before. I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me think again. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So each of the two carbons in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. So, each carbon is attached to two COOCH3, a double bond, and a CH2 group. Wait, no, perhaps each carbon is connected to two COOCH3 groups and a double bond. So, their substituents would be COOCH3, COOCH3, and double bond. No, perhaps it's:

Each carbon in the double bond has one COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. Wait, no, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If it does, then it can't be chiral. So, for dimethyl fumarate, the structure is symmetric across the double bond. Because both ends are identical—each has a COOCH3 group. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry along the double bond, meaning it's not chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Dimethyl fumarate, I think, is actually the trans isomer. But regardless, if the molecule is symmetric, then no optical isomerism. So, in that case, compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate) doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain. Let me think again. Suppose the structure is (COOCH3)₂C=CH₂. Then each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. So for the left carbon, it's connected to two COOCH3 groups, a double bond, and a CH₂ group. Wait, that doesn't add up. Each carbon in the double bond would have three substituents: two COOCH3 and the double bond. So, each has only three substituents, implying they're sp² hybridized. So, no, no chiral centers.

So, back to the four compounds. Let's recap:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. I'm not sure if this has a chiral structure. If the substituents are arranged in such a way that there's no plane of symmetry, it could be chiral. But I'm not confident. Maybe I should think about whether the molecule has a center of symmetry. If the substituents on each phenyl ring are arranged symmetrically, then it's not chiral. But I'm not exactly sure about the positions. Wait, in biphenyl compounds, the substituents can create a situation where the molecule is non-symmetrical. For example, if the substituents are at ortho, meta, or para positions relative to the connecting bond, that can affect symmetry. In this case, substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on each ring. Let me imagine the structure: the biphenyl is connected at position 1. So the substituent at 2 is next to the connecting bond, and the substituent at 6 is across. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2. So, each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. So the arrangement for each ring is the same. So, if the two rings are connected in such a way that the substituents mirror each other across a plane, then the molecule would be symmetrical and not chiral. But if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, perhaps in this case, the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. I'm not sure. Maybe I can think of a simpler case. For example, if each phenyl ring has two substituents in para positions relative to each other, but on the same side of the biphenyl, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl's substituents are such that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. Hmm. I'm not certain, but I'm leaning towards this compound (1) not having optical isomerism because the substituents are symmetrically arranged, but I'm not confident.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. As I concluded earlier, it has a chiral center, so yes, it exhibits optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. No optical isomerism as it's symmetrical.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. No optical isomerism as it's symmetric and has no chiral centers.

Wait, but earlier I thought that dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism, but some sources say that fumarate itself can have geometric isomerism (E and Z), but that's different from optical isomerism. So, in any case, for optical isomerism, maybe only compound 2 shows it.

Wait, but looking back at option A) 1,2,4; B) 3,4; C)2,3; D)1,2.

Wait, if only compound 2 shows optical isomerism, then which option includes that? Let's see:

Looking at the options:

A) 1,2,4 --> includes 2
B)3,4 --> doesn't include 2
C)2,3 --> includes 2 and 3, but 3 doesn't have optical isomerism.
D)1,2 --> includes 2, but 1 I'm not sure.

Wait, but earlier I thought that maybe compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate) doesn't have optical isomerism, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I got compound 4 wrong. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So, the structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. Wait, no, the correct structure is (CH₂COOCH3)CH₂CH₂(COOCH3). No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's (COOCH3)₂CH=CH₂. No, that would be butyl something. Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH₂=CH with each CH having a COOCH3 group on each end. So, it's (COOCH3)₂CH=CH₂. So each CH in the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So, each of those CH groups is attached to two COOCH3 groups and a double bond. So, each CH in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups, a double bond, and another substituent (H, perhaps). So, each CH group in the double bond would have two COOCH3, a CH2 group, and a double bond. Wait, no, each CH in the double bond is connected to one COOCH3 group. So, one substituent is COOCH3, one is H, and the other is the double bond.

Wait, no, if the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, then each CH in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. But that's impossible because each carbon in the double bond can only have three substituents (since it's sp² hybridized). So, perhaps each CH in the double bond has one COOCH3 and one other substituent. So, the structure would be CH2=CH(COOCH3), but that can't be right because fumarate is a diester, so it has two ester groups.

Wait, I think the correct structure is (COOCH3)₂C=CH₂. So, the double bond is between the central carbons, each of which has two COOCH3 groups. But that would mean each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups, which is impossible because each carbon can only have three substituents besides the double bond. So, I'm getting stuck, but I think that the correct conclusion is that dimethyl fumarate is symmetric and doesn't have a chiral center, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, putting it all together:

1. Not sure. Let's think again.

The structure is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each phenyl ring is connected at position 1. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester (COOCH3) at position 2.

So, for each phenyl ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6. The 2 position is adjacent to the connecting bond (since the biphenyl is at position 1), and the 6 position is three away (since in a benzene ring, positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 go around; so position 6 is across from position 1, which is where the biphenyl connects).

So, each phenyl ring has a substituent at 2 (COOCH3) and 6 (NO2). Now, the question is, does this create a situation where the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral, or does it lack symmetry, making it chiral.

If the substituents are in such a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, then it's chiral.

Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral.

In this case, the two phenyl rings each have substituents at 2 and 6. So, each ring has a COOCH3 at 2 and a nitro at 6. Now, looking at the entire molecule, the arrangement of substituents on each ring might mirror each other across the central bond, creating a plane of symmetry. So, the molecule might be symmetrical and not chiral.

Wait, but wait: the arrangement could be such that each ring has substituents that are mirror images of each other. For example, if the COOCH3 is in the ortho position on one ring and the nitro is in the para position on the same ring, perhaps the molecule as a whole is symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement is such that the substituents are not symmetrical, leading to a lack of a plane of symmetry. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: if the substituents' positions on each ring are such that the molecule has a center of symmetry, then it's not chiral. So, if the substituents are arranged in a way that each has a mirror counterpart on the opposite ring, then there's a center of symmetry.

In this case, each ring has COOCH3 at 2 and nitro at 6. So, on the opposite ring, the substituents would be mirrored. So, the molecule would have a center of symmetry because substituents on each ring are mirrored through the central bond.

So, in that case, the molecule would be achiral, meaning it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, putting it all together:

Compound 1: No optical isomerism (symmetrical).
Compound 2: Yes.
Compounds 3 and 4: No.

So, only option 2 shows optical isomerism. Wait, but looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A (1,2,4), option D (1,2), and option C (2 and 3). Since 1 doesn't show, D is incorrect. Option A includes 4, which we think doesn't show, so A is incorrect. Option C includes 3, which doesn't show.

Wait, this suggests that only option 2 is correct. But looking at the options, none of the options has only 2 as the correct answer. Let me re-examine the options.

The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4
B) 3 and 4
C) 2 and 3
D) 1 and 2

Wait, if only compound 2 shows optical isomerism, then no option includes only 2. But that can't be, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Maybe dimethyl fumarate does exhibit optical isomerism. Let's think again.

Dimethyl fumarate: If the structure is (COOCH3)₂C=CH₂, then each of the two carbons in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. But that would make each carbon in the double bond have three substituents: two COOCH3 and the double bond, which isn't possible since each carbon can have only three substituents besides the double bond. Wait, perhaps each carbon in the double bond has one COOCH3 group and two other substituents. So, perhaps the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). So, each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 group and two other substituents (like H and CH2). Wait, but that would make each carbon have four substituents, which is impossible for sp² hybridized carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. So each CH in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. That would make each CH have three substituents besides the double bond. Wait, but that's not possible. So perhaps the molecule is not chiral because it's symmetric.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let me think about the possibility of each compound having a chiral center or another form of chirality.

- Compound 1: biphenyl with substituents. If the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, the molecule could be chiral. But if they're symmetric, then it's not. So unsure.

- Compound 2: definitely has a chiral center. So, yes.

- Compound 3: symmetric, so no.

- Compound 4: no chiral centers, so no.

So, only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But none of the options have only 2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. Its structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. Each CH in the double bond has one COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. So, each CH has substituents: COOCH3, CH₂ (from the other end), and H.

Wait, but that would make each CH have three substituents: COOCH3, CH₂, and H. So, for each CH in the double bond, the substituents are COOCH3, H, and two CH₂ groups (from the adjacent carbons). Wait, no, each CH in the double bond is connected to two other CH₂ groups. No, perhaps it's better to imagine the structure as:

(CH₂COOCH3)₂CH=CH₂.

So, each of the two central carbons in the double bond is connected to a CH₂COOCH3 group and a CH₂ group. So, each of those carbons has two CH₂ groups, a COOCH3, and a double bond. No, that doesn't add up.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH₂-CH₂
|
COOCH3

But that's not a double bond. No, wait, the correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is (COOCH3)₂C=CH₂. So, each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So, each carbon has substituents: COOCH3, CH₂, and a double bond. Wait, but that would make each carbon have three substituents, which is possible for sp² carbons. So, in this structure, each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group, a CH₂ group, and a double bond. So, each has two identical substituents (COOCH3 and CH₂ groups? No, perhaps each has COOCH3, CH₂, and a double bond. Now, in this case, would the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Because the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond (E configuration) or opposite (Z)? No, wait, E is opposite, Z is same side.

But regardless, the molecule's symmetry would depend on the substituents. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry and not be chiral. So, in the case of E configuration, the substituents are on opposite sides, but that doesn't necessarily create chirality. Because each substituent is the same (two COOCH3 groups on each carbon), the molecule would be symmetrical. Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, back to the original question: which of the four compounds exhibit optical isomerism.

Only compound 2 seems to exhibit optical isomerism. But none of the options have only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1.

Wait, another possibility: compound 1 has two nitro groups and two COOCH3 groups on the biphenyl. If these substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it could be chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are not mirror images, then the molecule would be chiral.

Wait, the positions are 2 and 6 on each ring. So, for each ring, the substituents are at 2 (COOCH3) and 6 (NO2). Now, considering the biphenyl arrangement, the substituents on the two rings might be arranged in a way that makes the molecule non-symmetrical. For example, if the COOCH3 groups are on the same side of each ring, and the nitro groups are on the opposite sides, then the molecule could lack a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the molecule has a center of inversion, making it achiral.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral. For example, if the two rings each have a COOCH3 and a nitro group, but their positions relative to the central bond create a lack of symmetry.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. But if compound 1 is chiral, then the correct answer would include 1 and 2.

Looking back at the options, option D includes 1 and 2.

So, if both 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism, then the correct answer would be D.

But earlier, I thought that compound 1 might not be chiral, but perhaps I was wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps compound 1 has a plane of symmetry.

Wait, another approach: in biphenyl compounds, when substituents are at the 2 and 6 positions, the molecule may or may not have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are in positions that mirror each other across the central bond, then the molecule is symmetrical. If not, it's asymmetrical.

In this case, each ring has a COOCH3 at 2 and a NO2 at 6. So, for both rings, the substituents are at 2 and 6. If the two rings are arranged such that the substituents on each ring are mirror images, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. But if they're not, then it's chiral.

Wait, the way the substituents are arranged on each ring: the COOCH3 is at 2 (ortho to the connecting bond), and the NO2 is at 6 (para to the connecting bond). So, on each ring, the substituents are in fixed positions relative to the connecting bond.

If the two rings are connected at position 1, and each has a substituent at 2 and 6, then the arrangement across the biphenyl might be such that the substituents are symmetrical. For example, the COOCH3 on one ring is in a certain position relative to the connecting bond, and the COOCH3 on the other ring is in a mirrored position. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

But I'm not entirely confident. However, if I consider that in the case of 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, and the molecule is symmetric across the central bond, then it would not be chiral. So, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, only compound 2 does. But again, the options don't have an option with only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering compound 4.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center. Let me think again. The structure is:

(CH₂COOCH3)₂CH=CH₂.

So, each of the two central carbons in the double bond is attached to a CH₂COOCH3 group and a CH₂ group. So, each of those central carbons has three substituents: CH₂COOCH3, CH₂, and a double bond. Wait, but that's three substituents plus the double bond. So, each carbon is sp² hybridized. So, no, no chiral centers. Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But none of the options have only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking about compound 1.

An alternative approach: think about the possibility of compound 1 being chiral. Let's say the substituents on each ring create an asymmetric center. For example, if the substituents are arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then the molecule would be chiral.

In this case, each ring has a COOCH3 and a NO2 group. The arrangement of these on each ring might not be symmetric. For example, if the COOCH3 is on one side and the NO2 is on the opposite, but the two rings' substituents are not mirrored, then the molecule would lack symmetry and be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

If that's the case, then compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism. So, then option D (compounds 1 and 2) would be the correct answer.

But I'm not entirely sure. I'm going to have to make a decision based on the information.

So, if I conclude that compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism, then the answer would be option D.

But wait, earlier I thought that compound 1 might not be chiral due to symmetry. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on the biphenyl are such that each ring has substituents that make the entire molecule asymmetric. For example, in each ring, the COOCH3 is at position 2, which is adjacent to the connecting bond, and the NO2 is at position 6, which is across from the connecting bond. So, on each ring, the substituents are in fixed positions, but when considering both rings, perhaps the arrangement is such that the molecule lacks symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the two rings each have substituents that are arranged symmetrically, making the molecule achiral. For example, the two rings each have a COOCH3 at 2 and a NO2 at 6. So, when looking across the central bond, the substituents mirror each other, making the molecule symmetrical.

In that case, compound 1 is not chiral.

So, only compound 2 is chiral. But none of the options have only 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate: if the molecule has a center of symmetry, it's not chiral. So, the E isomer (fumarate) would have the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond, leading to a symmetrical structure. So, it's not chiral. Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But again, the options don't have an option that includes only 2.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake about compound 2. Let me think again.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. The middle carbon (the CH(OH)) is connected to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So yes, a chiral center. So, compound 2 does show optical isomerism.

So, the only compound that shows optical isomerism is 2. But none of the options include only 2. So, perhaps the correct option is not listed. But that can't be, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps there's another possibility. Maybe compound 4 does have optical isomerism. Let me think: dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. But if it has a center of asymmetry, it could be chiral.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is not symmetric because the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond (the Z configuration) or opposite (E), but that affects geometric isomerism, not optical. So, regardless, the molecule itself isn't chiral because it doesn't have a chiral center.

So, I'm stuck. Based on my analysis, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on the biphenyl are arranged in such a way that the molecule is chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are not mirror images, making the molecule asymmetric.

In that case, compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism. So then, the correct answer would be D) 1 and 2.

But I'm not entirely confident. However, given the options, and considering that I might have made a mistake in assessing compound 1, I'll proceed with that.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound based on the presence of chirality, which requires a chiral center or a lack of symmetry in the molecule.

### **Compound 1: Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**

This compound consists of a biphenyl structure with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each phenyl ring. Each ring has a nitro group (NO₂) at position 6 and a carboxylate ester (COOCH₃) at position 2. The biphenyl system is connected at position 1. 

The substituents on the two rings are arranged symmetrically: each ring has the same substituents (NO₂ and COOCH₃) in the same relative positions (2 and 6). This symmetry suggests that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, **compound 1 does not exhibit optical isomerism**.

---

### **Compound 2: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**

The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The middle carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to four different groups: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center. Since the molecule has a chiral center, it can exist as two non-superimposable mirror images, meaning **compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism**.

---

### **Compound 3: Benzophenone**

Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂CO, where Ph represents a phenyl group. The molecule is symmetric, with two identical phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl group. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and does not have four different substituents. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry between the two phenyl groups. Therefore, **compound 3 does not exhibit optical isomerism**.

---

### **Compound 4: Dimethyl Fumarate**

Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of maleic acid and has the structure CH₂=CH(COOCH₃)₂. The two carbons in the double bond each have one COOCH₃ group and one hydrogen. The molecule is symmetric, as the substituents on the double bond are identical on both carbons. This symmetry prevents the molecule from being chiral. Therefore, **compound 4 does not exhibit optical isomerism**.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **Compound 1**: No optical isomerism (symmetrical).
- **Compound 2**: Exhibits optical isomerism (chiral center).
- **Compound 3**: No optical isomerism (symmetrical).
- **Compound 4**: No optical isomerism (symmetrical).

The only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is **compound 2**. However, none of the provided options explicitly include only compound 2. Based on the analysis, the most reasonable answer is **option D (1 and 2)**, assuming that compound 1 might exhibit optical isomerism under certain interpretations.
