Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the geometrical position of this density matrix in qubit space. Hmm, the density matrix given is ρ = 1/2 (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states.

Wait, so what does this matrix look like? Let me think. The |0⟩⟨0| is the outer product of the basis vector |0⟩ with itself, right? That gives a matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has a 1 in the bottom-right corner. Adding them together gives a matrix that has 1s on the diagonal and 0s off-diagonal. So when multiplied by 1/2, each diagonal element becomes 1/2. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with [1/2, 0; 0, 1/2].

Now, I'm a bit fuzzy on how this translates to the geometrical position in qubit space. I remember that for qubits, the state can be represented on the Bloch sphere. But wait, this is a density matrix, not a pure state. So maybe it's a mixed state.

Pure states are represented as points on the surface of the Bloch sphere, while mixed states are inside. The density matrix for a pure state |ψ⟩⟨ψ| would have eigenvalues 1 and 0. But here, the eigenvalues of ρ are both 1/2. Because ρ is diagonal with 1/2 and 1/2 on the diagonal, so the eigenvalues are 1/2 each.

Wait, so this is a completely mixed state. Because the density matrix is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, it's like being in a superposition but not a coherent one. So in terms of the Bloch vector, how does this look?

I think the Bloch sphere representation of a density matrix ρ is given by a vector r such that ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. Let me write that out. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So r would be (r_x, r_y, r_z).

If ρ is diagonal, that suggests that the off-diagonal terms are zero. Let's compute (I + r·σ)/2. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], and r·σ would be r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz. Each of those σ matrices has off-diagonal elements. So when you add them, the off-diagonals would be (r_x [0,1;1,0] ) + (r_y [0,-i; i,0] ) + (r_z [1,0; 0,-1]).

Wait, but the given ρ has zero off-diagonal terms. So for (I + r·σ)/2 to have zero off-diagonal terms, the terms from r_x σx and r_y σy must cancel each other out. Because σx has 1s off-diagonal, and σy has imaginary terms. So the only way the off-diagonal terms in (I + r·σ)/2 are zero is if r_x and r_y are zero. Because any non-zero r_x would contribute to the off-diagonal, and same for r_y.

So r_x and r_y must be zero. That leaves only r_z. Now, the diagonal terms of (I + r·σ)/2 would be (1 + r_z)/2 and (1 - r_z)/2. Because when r_x and r_y are zero, the diagonal elements are (1 + r_z σz)/2, which becomes [[ (1 + r_z)/2, 0 ], [0, (1 - r_z)/2 ] ].

But in our ρ matrix, the diagonal elements are both 1/2. So (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 and (1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2. Let's solve for r_z. From the first equation, (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z=0. Similarly, the second equation gives (1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 - r_z=1 → r_z=0. So r_z is zero.

Therefore, the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which is the origin. That makes sense because the state is completely mixed, equally likely to be in |0⟩ or |1⟩. So it's the maximally mixed state, which is at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This matrix is diagonal with entries \( \frac{1}{2} \) on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. The eigenvalues of this matrix are both \( \frac{1}{2} \), indicating it represents a completely mixed state.

To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. A density matrix \( \rho \) can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is the Bloch vector, and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices. For the given \( \rho \), the off-diagonal terms are zero, which implies \( r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \). The diagonal terms of \( \rho \) are both \( \frac{1}{2} \), which correspond to \( r_z = 0 \). Thus, the Bloch vector is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), representing the origin in qubit space.

This result is consistent with the fact that the state is maximally mixed, meaning it has no preference for being in \( |0\rangle \) or \( |1\rangle \), and is therefore at the center of the Bloch sphere.
