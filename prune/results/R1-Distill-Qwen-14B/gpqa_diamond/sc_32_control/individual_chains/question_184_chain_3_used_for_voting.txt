Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right sequence of reactions to make 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, the target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1, 2, and 3, but wait, numbering might be a bit confusing. Oh wait, in IUPAC numbering, the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. Let me visualize the benzene ring. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So, it's a meta arrangement between the ethoxy and nitro, and adjacent between ethoxy and tert-butyl.

Since benzene is the starting material, I need to introduce these substituents in the right order. The key here is directing effects of the substituents. Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions, and each substituent can direct incoming groups to specific positions.

Let me think about each substituent's directing effects:

- The tert-butyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing substituent because it's an alkyl group.
- The ethoxy group is an activating, ortho/para-directing substituent as well since it's an ether.
- The nitro group is a deactivating, meta-directing substituent.

Wait, but when introducing substituents, the order in which they are added will affect where the next substituent goes. So, the first substituent will determine the position of the second, and the second will influence the third.

But wait, the ethoxy group is an activating group (since oxygen is in the +1 oxidation state; it donates electrons through resonance). The tert-butyl is also activating (donates electrons via inductive effect). Nitro is strongly deactivating (electron-withdrawing), making the ring less reactive and directing meta.

Hmm, the target molecule has nitro at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and tert-butyl at 2. Wait, that might not make sense in terms of numbering. Let me clarify the positions.

Wait, benzene is a ring, so if ethoxy is at position 1, then the next substituent can be at 2 (ortho) or 3 (meta). So, the nitro is at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy. The tert-butyl is at position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy.

Wait, but how can both substituents be added? Let's think about the order.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to plan the steps:

1. Introduce one substituent, then another, and then a third.

But given that the substituents are directing, the order of adding will influence where the other groups go.

Let me think about the possible sequences.

Option D starts with nitration. So, first step is HNO3/H2SO4. That would add a nitro group to benzene, giving nitrobenzene. Then next step is Fe/HCl, which is a catalyst for substitution perhaps? Wait, no, Fe/HCl is usually for something else. Maybe it's a way to introduce a leaving group, like in a SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution), but that requires activating groups.

Wait, no, after nitro group, the ring is deactivated. So, adding another substituent after nitration would be difficult because nitro is a strong deactivating group. So, perhaps the nitro group is added last.

Wait, maybe the nitro group is added after activating groups are in place. Let me think.

Another approach: since nitro is deactivating, perhaps it's better to add it after other activating groups are present to direct it properly.

Wait, let's think about the target molecule again. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, 3. So, if we have ethoxy at position 1, and nitro at 3 (meta to ethoxy), and tert-butyl at 2 (ortho to ethoxy), which is adjacent to ethoxy.

Wait, but how would each substituent influence the next?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first. Let's say we nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene. But then, adding another substituent would be tough because nitro is meta-directing. However, the target has ethoxy and tert-butyl adjacent to each other. So, maybe nitro is added later.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added first. Then, the tert-butyl group can be added in the ortho or para position relative to ethoxy. Then, nitro is added in the meta position relative to ethoxy, which would be ortho to the tert-butyl.

Wait, but the nitro group is meta to ethoxy, but in the target, the nitro is at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy (position 1). So, ethoxy is at 1, nitro at 3, tert-butyl at 2.

So, if ethoxy is added first, next we add tert-butyl in the ortho position, then nitro.

But wait, after adding ethoxy, the ring is activated. So, when adding tert-butyl, it should be in ortho or para to ethoxy. If we add tert-butyl next, it would go into the para position of ethoxy, which might not be desired. Because in the target, the tert-butyl is ortho to ethoxy.

Alternatively, maybe the order is: first tert-butyl, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Wait, let me consider each substitution:

1. Add tert-butyl group. So, benzene becomes tert-butylbenzene. Since tert-butyl is activating, it directs incoming substituents to ortho and para positions.

2. Then, add ethoxy. Since tert-butyl is at position 1, adding ethoxy could be either ortho (position 2) or para (position 4). But in the target, ethoxy is at position 1. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, perhaps the numbering is such that the substituents are arranged as ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, in a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged as follows: ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2 (ortho), and nitro at position 3 (meta to ethoxy and adjacent to tert-butyl? Not sure.)

Wait, perhaps I should approach it by considering the possible steps each option gives and see which one leads to the correct structure.

Looking at the options, each option has a series of steps. Let me try to parse each.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add tert-butyl. But wait, tert-butyl chloride is bulky. For Friedel-Crafts, activating groups are needed because it's an electrophilic substitution. Since benzene is the starting material, adding tert-butyl is possible as the first step.

Wait, but wait, the first step is AlCl3 and tert-butyl chloride, so that's FC alkylation. Benzene becomes tert-butylbenzene.

Next, step ii is HNO3/H2SO4: nitration. Now, the ring has a tert-butyl group, which is activating, ortho/para director.

Nitration would introduce a nitro group either in the ortho, meta, or para position relative to tert-butyl.

Wait, no: with an activating group, the incoming electrophile will be directed to ortho and para positions. So, nitration after FC alkylation would add nitro either ortho or para to tert-butyl.

But in the target, the nitro is at 3, and tert-butyl is at 2. So, if the ethoxy is at 1, and tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3 is ortho to ethoxy (since 1 and 3 are meta to each other?) Wait, no. Let me think again about the benzene ring. Positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent, in a row.

So, ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2 (ortho to ethoxy), nitro at 3 (meta to ethoxy and adjacent to tert-butyl).

Wait, but if the first substitution is adding tert-butyl at position 1, then nitration would be either 2 or 4 (ortho and para). Then, adding ethoxy would be another step.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting complicated. Let me think about the steps in each option.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration of benzene to nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl: Maybe this is a substitution reaction. Wait, Fe in HCl is often used in the reduction of nitro groups, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be for some other reaction.

Wait, nitrobenzene is the product after step i. Then step ii is Fe/HCl. Fe in HCl is often used for the Rosenmund reduction, which reduces acid chlorides to aldehydes, but that's probably not relevant here. Alternatively, it's used in the Birch reduction, which reduces aromatic rings but that's under different conditions. Hmm, perhaps it's part of a substitution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe step ii is a substitution. Nitrobenzene is a meta director. Adding something via substitution when the ring is deactivated would require a strong activating group. But that's not present here. Alternatively, perhaps it's a desulfonation or other process.

Hmm, perhaps this option is not correct because after nitration, adding another substituent would be difficult.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: FC alkylation. So benzene becomes tert-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration. So, nitro group is added either ortho or para to tert-butyl.

iii) Fe/HCl: Maybe this is a substitution, perhaps a nitro group is reduced. Wait, Fe/HCl is acidic conditions. If the nitro group is present, Fe/HCl might convert it into something else. Or perhaps it's for a substitution reaction, like removing a group.

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, Fe in HCl can be a catalyst for substitution reactions, but not sure.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4: another nitration step. But why would you nitrate twice?

The target molecule has only one nitro group, so option B includes another nitration which may not be needed.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: FC alkylation, benzene becomes tert-butylbenzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4: sulfonation? Sulfuric acid with SO3 would add a sulfonic acid group. But that's a strong deactivating group, which would not be desired, as it would affect where the next substituents go.

Wait, sulfonation is often used as a protecting group or for directing. So, after adding tert-butyl, sulfonating would add a strong deactivating group, making the ring less reactive, but directing incoming groups to certain positions.

Wait, but I'm not sure how that would help in this case.

Hmm.

Let me think again about the target molecule. We have three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro.

The ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

So, perhaps the ethoxy is added first. Let's think about that.

Step 1: introduce ethoxy group. But wait, benzene can't undergo nucleophilic substitution. So, to add an ethoxy group, we need a good leaving group. But that's not possible in benzene. Alternatively, we can perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation for ethoxy? Wait, no. Friedel-Crafts is for alkyl groups, but to add an ethoxy group, perhaps we can use a substitution via a different method.

Wait, another way: perhaps to introduce an ethoxy group via an SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution), but that requires a strongly activated ring with a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to perform a substitution after activating the ring.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after the ring has been nitrated, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution on a benzene ring that already has a nitro group, which is a meta director.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl group first.

2. Then add ethoxy group.

3. Then add nitro group.

But when adding the nitro group, it should be in the correct position relative to ethoxy.

Wait, let's think about the sequence.

First, add tert-butyl (say, at position 1).

Then, adding ethoxy group. Since tert-butyl is activating and ortho/para-directing, the ethoxy would go ortho or para to tert-butyl. If we want ethoxy at position 2, which is ortho to tert-butyl (position 1), that could work.

Then, the next step would be nitration. Now, the ring has tert-butyl at 1 and ethoxy at 2.

Each substituent directs the next. tert-Butyl is activating, ethoxy is activating.

But when adding nitro, which is deactivating, the substituents already present will direct.

Wait, in the molecule after adding tert-butyl and ethoxy, the substituents are at positions 1 and 2.

So, the ring has a tert-butyl at 1 and ethoxy at 2.

Now, when nitrating, the incoming nitro group will be directed by whichever substituent is stronger.

Wait, both substituents are activating, so they are ortho/para directors. The ethoxy is more activating (since it's an ether, a stronger activating group than an alkyl group) because ethers are more activating than alky groups. So, the ethoxy group would have a stronger directing effect.

So, the nitro group would be added either ortho or para to ethoxy.

If we have ethoxy at 2, the ortho positions are 1 and 3, and the para is position 6.

But in the target, the nitro is at position 3. So, if we have ethoxy at 2, and nitrate, the nitro would go to position 3 (ortho to ethoxy) or 6 (para).

But in the target, nitro is at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy (since ethoxy is at 1? Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused with the numbering again.

Wait, let's try a different approach. Let me draw the benzene ring mentally.

Suppose the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let's position them as follows:

- Ethoxy at position 1
- tert-Butyl at position 2
- Nitro at position 3

So, when adding substituents in the order:

1. tert-butyl (position 2)
2. ethoxy (position 1)
3. nitro (position 3)

Wait, but after adding tert-butyl at position 2, adding ethoxy would need to be in a position directed by tert-butyl. Since tert-butyl is activating and ortho/para, ethoxy could go to positions 1, 3, or 4 (assuming tert-butyl is at position 2). Wait, no, benzene is a ring, so the positions are relative.

So, imagine benzene ring with substituent A at position 2. When adding substituent B, which is directed by A, B can go to positions 1, 3 (ortho) or 6 and 4 (para).

So, when adding ethoxy after tert-butyl (which is at 2), ethoxy could go to ortho positions 1 and 3, or para position 6.

But in the target, ethoxy is at position 1, which is ortho to tert-butyl.

So, after adding ethoxy, the ring has tert-butyl at 2, ethoxy at 1.

Now, the next step is nitration. The substituents present are ethoxy (activating, ortho/para) and tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para). The ethoxy is more activating, so the nitro group would be directed by ethoxy.

Ethoxy is at position 1, so nitro would go ortho (positions 2 and 6) or para (position 4). But position 2 is already occupied by tert-butyl, so the next possible ortho is position 6. Alternatively, para would be position 4. But in the target, nitro is at position 3.

Hmm, that suggests that my earlier assumption about the order of substitution is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added before the ethoxy.

Wait, let's try another order:

1. Nitration of benzene: nitro at position 1.

2. Then, adding tert-butyl. But nitro is deactivating, so FC alkylation would be difficult. Alternatively, perhaps after nitration, another substituent is added via a different method.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added last. Because nitration is a deactivating step, which would make further substitutions harder.

So, perhaps the correct order is ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

Wait, in that case:

1. Add ethoxy group. But how? Because benzene can't undergo substitution without a leaving group.

Ah, wait, perhaps ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a good leaving group and a strongly activating group.

Alternatively, perhaps ethoxy is added via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by something else. No, that would give a ketone, which is a meta director.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the ring has been sulfonated, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the ring has a good leaving group, like a nitro group being converted into something else.

Wait, perhaps the order is:

1. Nitration: nitro group at position 1.

2. Then, introduce a leaving group, like converting nitro to a nitroso, or perhaps to a sulfonic acid group.

But that's getting too vague.

Alternatively, think about the options and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at the options, I'll try to parse each.

Option D: Steps are nitrate, Fe/HCl, FC alkylation, nitrate again, etc. Hmm, but adding nitro first would make adding other groups difficult. So, perhaps this is not the right approach.

Option C: Steps are FC alkylation, sulfonation, nitration, Fe/HCl, etc. Sulfonation would add a strong deactivating group, which may complicate further reactions.

Option B: Steps include FC alkylation, nitration, Fe/HCl, nitration again. Not sure about that.

Option A: Steps are FC alkylation, nitration, SO3, etc. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the order in which the substituents are added.

The target molecule has three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. The positions are such that ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3.

If I were to add the substituents in the order: tert-butyl, then ethoxy, then nitro.

After adding tert-butyl, the ethoxy would be added in ortho or para to it. Then, nitro would be added in a position directed by both substituents.

Wait, let's think in more detail.

1. First step: FC alkylation with tert-butyl chloride → benzene → tert-butylbenzene.

2. Second step: Introduce ethoxy group.

But how? Because benzene is now tert-butylbenzene; to add an ethoxy group, which is a strong activating group, perhaps via a substitution.

Wait, but to introduce an ethoxy group via electrophilic substitution, you need a good leaving group. But benzene doesn't have that. So, perhaps a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced as a nucleophilic substitution, but that requires a good leaving group in the ring. Alternatively, it's introduced via a directing group.

Another thought: Maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that would add an acyl group, which would need to be reduced or hydrolyzed to an ethoxy group. That seems a bit convoluted, but perhaps possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after the ring has been nitrated. Wait, but nitro is deactivating and meta-directing.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a good leaving group, like a nitro group which can be converted to a nitroso or something else.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.

2. Convert nitro to a good leaving group (like a nitroso group?), but I'm not sure how that's done.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after the ring has a nitro group. But I'm not certain.

This is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Looking at option D:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduces nitro group? Let me think: Fe in HCl is acidic conditions. Nitrobenzene can be reduced to phenylamine using H2/Pd, but Fe/HCl might perform a different kind of reduction. Alternatively, it might be a substitution.

Wait, perhaps Fe/HCl is for demethylation or other substitution reactions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a way to introduce a leaving group.

After nitration, step ii is Fe/HCl. Hmm.

Then, step iii is FC alkylation with tert-butyl chloride. But nitrobenzene is deactivating, making FC alkylation difficult. So perhaps this is not feasible.

So, option D seems unlikely.

Option B:

i) FC alkylation → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) Nitration → nitro added ortho or para to tert-butyl.

iii) Fe/HCl → Not sure what this step does.

iv) Nitration again → but target has only one nitro.

Hmm.

Option C:

i) FC alkylation → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) Sulfonation → adds a sulfonic acid group, which is deactivating and meta-directing.

Then, iii) nitration → nitro would be added meta to sulfonic acid and perhaps ortho/para to tert-butyl. But this seems complicated.

I'm not sure.

Option A:

i) FC alkylation → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) Nitration → nitro added ortho or para.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → not sure.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps a substitution.

viii) Fe/HCl → not sure.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration?

This seems like it's introducing multiple groups, but I'm not certain how.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

Add ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

But how to add ethoxy first. Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution on a ring that has a leaving group, like a tosyl group.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps ethoxy is added via a substitution after a nitro group has been introduced, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is FC alkylation (tert-butyl), then nitration, then ethoxy substitution.

But how to add ethoxy after nitration, which is deactivating.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution that uses a strong base, but that's not common in aromatic substitution.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after the nitro group has been introduced, but that would require a leaving group, which I'm not seeing.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options and the steps each one implies.

The target molecule has the substituents in positions 1, 2, 3.

Assume ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

So, when adding substituents, the first substituent directs the next.

So, if we add ethoxy first, then the next substituent (tert-butyl) would go ortho or para to ethoxy. Nitro then would go meta to ethoxy and ortho to tert-butyl.

Wait, but let's see:

1. Add ethoxy → benzene → ethoxybenzene.

2. Add tert-butyl: directed to ortho (position 2) or para (position 4) relative to ethoxy.

Suppose we add tert-butyl at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy).

3. Now, the ring has ethoxy at 1 and tert-butyl at 2. Next, nitration.

The substituents present are ethoxy (activating, ortho/para) and tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para). The ethoxy is more activating, so nitration would be directed by that.

Ethoxy is at 1, so nitro would go ortho (positions 2 or 6) or para (position 4). But position 2 is already occupied by tert-butyl, so nitro could go to position 6 (ortho) or 4 (para). But in the target, nitro is at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy and adjacent to tert-butyl.

Hmm, that's a problem. So how can nitro end up at position 3 in this scenario?

Wait, perhaps after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the nitration is directed by both groups.

Ethoxy is more activating, so it would dominate. So, nitration would be ortho or para to ethoxy.

But in the target, nitro is at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy. So this suggests that perhaps the nitro group is added in a position directed by the tert-butyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is: ethoxy, nitro, tert-butyl.

But then, after ethoxy, nitration would be meta to ethoxy, but that would place nitro in a position that's not adjacent to tert-butyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is: tert-butyl, nitro, ethoxy.

But let's see. After adding tert-butyl, nitration adds nitro ortho or para to tert-butyl. Then, adding ethoxy would be directed by both groups.

Wait, but after nitration, the ring is deactivating, making FC alkylation difficult.

This is getting really complicated.

Perhaps I should look for the option where the nitro group is added last, to a position directed by the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups which are already present.

Looking at the options, perhaps option D has a nitration step at the end. Let's look.

Option D:

Steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduces nitro to amine, but I'm not sure.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → FC alkylation. But nitro is deactivating, so FC alkylation is unlikely to work.

So, option D's steps after nitration are problematic.

Option B:

i) FC alkylation → tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate, add nitro ortho or para to tert-butyl.

iii) Fe/HCl → not sure.

iv) HNO3 again → another nitro, but target has one.

Hmm.

Option C:

i) FC alkylation → tert-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate, adding a strong deactivating group.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate, which would be directed meta to sulfonate and ortho/para to tert-butyl.

But sulfonate is deactivating, so the nitration would be directed by the sulfonate. So nitro would go meta to sulfonate, but the sulfonate is at position 1, for example. Then, nitro would be at position 4, perhaps.

But I'm not sure how that leads to the desired product.

Option A:

i) FC alkylation → tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3 → nitro.

iii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis, perhaps of a diazonium salt.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → maybe steam distillation or something else.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps an SN2 reaction, substituting Br with ethoxy.

viii) Fe/HCl → not sure.

ix) HNO3 → another nitration.

This seems like a possible way to add ethoxy via a substitution.

Wait, perhaps the steps after SO3 are introducing a leaving group.

Let me think: after step ii, nitro is added. Step iii, SO3 → sulfonate, which is a strong deactivating group. Then, step iv: NaNO2/HCl → diazotization, which requires an amine. But nitro is present, not an amine.

Wait, perhaps step iv is a diazotization of an aromatic amine. But in the molecule up to step iii, we have tert-butyl, nitro, and sulfonate groups. So, no amine present. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D.

Wait, no, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the steps each option has and see which leads to the correct structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D because it starts with nitration, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the target molecule has an ethoxy group. So, in the reaction steps, there must be a step where an ethoxy group is introduced, which likely involves a substitution reaction. Looking at the options, I see steps with NaOH/EtBr, which is a typical condition for an SN2 reaction, substituting a bromide with an ethoxy group.

So, perhaps the sequence is:

- Add a bromine substituent at a certain position.

- Then, perform an SN2 substitution with NaOH and EtBr to replace Br with OEt.

Looking at the options, I see steps involving NaOH/EtBr in options A, B, C, and D.

So, in which option is Br introduced before being replaced by OEt?

Looking at option D:

vii) dilute H2SO4 → perhaps hydrolysis.

viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → maybe workup.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

But how is Br introduced? Perhaps earlier steps.

In option D, steps i to iii: nitrate, Fe/HCl, FC alkylation.

Wait, FC alkylation uses AlCl3 and an alkyl chloride to add an alkyl group. So, step iii adds tert-butyl.

But if step i is nitrate, then step iii is adding tert-butyl, but nitro is deactivating, so FC alkylation may not work.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the option where ethoxy is introduced via substitution after a leaving group is present.

So, perhaps the steps are:

- Add tert-butyl.

- Add nitro.

- Then, introduce a leaving group, like Br, at the desired position.

- Then, substitute Br with OEt.

Looking for an option that does this.

Option A has steps i) FC alkylation (tert-butyl), ii) nitration, iii) sulfonation, iv) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization?), v) H2SO4, vi) H3O+, vii) NaOH/EtBr.

So, after steps i and ii, we have tert-butyl and nitro groups. Then, step iii is sulfonation, adding a sulfonic acid group. Then, step iv is diazotization, which would require an amine, but I don't see an amine here.

Alternatively, perhaps step iii is introducing a leaving group.

Wait, sulfonation adds a -SO3H group, which is a strong deactivating group. Then, perhaps step iv is converting that into a good leaving group.

Wait, step iv is NaNO2/HCl → diazotization, but that requires an amine. Not present. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps step iii is sulfonation, which makes a leaving group, but I don't think so. Sulfonic acid is a strong -I group but not a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps after sulfonation, the sulfonic acid group is converted into a bromide or another leaving group.

But none of the steps in option A after sulfonation do that.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D, but I'm not seeing it.

Another approach: the target molecule has an ethoxy group, which can be introduced via a substitution. So, perhaps in the steps, the ethoxy group is added via NaOH/EtBr, which is a typical condition for that substitution.

Looking at the options, which one has the substitution (NaOH/EtBr) after introducing a bromine or a good leaving group in the correct position.

So, the bromide would have to be introduced in the correct position, perhaps via a previous nitration or other step.

Let me check option B:

Steps:

i) FC alkylation → tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3 → nitro.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe substitution.

iv) HNO3 again → another nitro.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

viii) SO3 → sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → perhaps hydrolysis.

Hmm, this seems to involve multiple nitration and substitution steps, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, option C:

Steps:

i) FC alkylation → tert-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → substitution.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3 → nitrate again.

vii) H3O+, H2O → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → perhaps acid workup.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

In this case, the substitution occurs after several steps, but I'm not certain where the bromide comes from.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromide is introduced via a nitration step followed by something else, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should make an educated guess.

The correct order would be to first add the tert-butyl group, then ethoxy, then nitro.

But how to do that.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after a nitro group is present, but that seems difficult.

Another thought: perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via Friedel-Crafts, but that requires the ring to be activated. So, perhaps the ring must be activated by an activating group.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts is for alkyl groups. To introduce an ethoxy group via FC would require an acylium ion, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after a nitro group is converted into a good leaving group.

But I'm not certain.

Given the time I've spent, I'll try to make an educated guess. The correct option is likely option D, but I'm not confident.

Wait, looking again at the target molecule: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

The ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at 3, tert-butyl at 2.

Wait, if I first add nitro at position 1, then add tert-butyl at position 2 (ortho), then add ethoxy at position 1, but that doesn't make sense because ethoxy would have to be added after nitro, which is deactivating.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitro at position 1.

2. FC alkylation with tert-butyl chloride → tert-butyl at position 2 (ortho to nitro, but nitro is meta director, so it would go para).

Wait, no, nitro is meta director. So, FC alkylation after nitration would add tert-butyl in the meta position to nitro. So, if nitro is at 1, tert-butyl would be at 4. But in the target, it's at 2.

Hmm, maybe this is the wrong path.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

1. FC alkylation → tert-butyl at position 1.

2. Nitration → nitro at position 3 (meta to tert-butyl).

3. Introduce ethoxy group at position 2 (ortho to tert-butyl), but how?

Because after nitration, the ring is deactivating, so FC alkylation (for ethoxy?) is not possible. So, perhaps ethoxy is introduced via substitution.

Wait, perhaps after nitration, the ring has nitro at position 3. Then, add a leaving group at position 2 (ortho to tert-butyl), and then substitute with ethoxy.

But how to add a leaving group at position 2?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after the nitro is introduced.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. I think the correct answer is option D, but I'm not certain.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the key is to consider the directing effects of substituents and the sequence of reactions. The target molecule has three substituents: an ethoxy group at position 1, a tert-butyl group at position 2, and a nitro group at position 3. The substituents must be introduced in an order that ensures proper directing and activation of the benzene ring.

### Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation introduces the tert-butyl group.
2. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration introduces the nitro group, which would be directed ortho or para to the tert-butyl group.
3. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group, which is strongly deactivating and meta-directing.
4. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization, typically used for converting amines to diazonium salts, but no amine is present here.
5. **dilute H₂SO₄**: Likely hydrolysis, but the role is unclear.
6. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Possibly a workup step.
7. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitution reaction to introduce the ethoxy group.
8. **Fe/HCl**: Reduction or substitution, but the purpose is unclear.
9. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Another nitration, but the target molecule has only one nitro group.

This sequence is overly complex and does not clearly lead to the desired product.

#### **Option B**:
1. **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation introduces the tert-butyl group.
2. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration introduces the nitro group, directed ortho or para to the tert-butyl group.
3. **Fe/HCl**: Likely reduction of the nitro group to an amine.
4. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Another nitration, but the target molecule has only one nitro group.
5. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization of the amine.
6. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt.
7. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitution to introduce the ethoxy group.
8. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation, which adds a deactivating group.
9. **dilute H₂SO₄**: Likely a workup step.

The presence of multiple nitrations and unclear steps make this sequence unsuitable.

#### **Option C**:
1. **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation introduces the tert-butyl group.
2. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group, which is strongly deactivating and meta-directing.
3. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration introduces the nitro group, directed meta to the sulfonic acid and ortho/para to the tert-butyl group.
4. **Fe/HCl**: Likely reduction or substitution, but the purpose is unclear.
5. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization, but no amine is present.
6. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Another nitration, but the target molecule has only one nitro group.
7. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Possibly a workup step.
8. **dilute H₂SO₄**: Likely a workup step.
9. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitution to introduce the ethoxy group.

The sulfonation step introduces a deactivating group, complicating further reactions, and the sequence does not clearly lead to the desired product.

#### **Option D**:
1. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration introduces the nitro group.
2. **Fe/HCl**: Likely reduction of the nitro group to an amine.
3. **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation introduces the tert-butyl group.
4. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Another nitration, but the target molecule has only one nitro group.
5. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization of the amine.
6. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation, which adds a deactivating group.
7. **dilute H₂SO₄**: Likely a workup step.
8. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Possibly a workup step.
9. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitution to introduce the ethoxy group.

The nitration step first deactivates the ring, making subsequent reactions like Friedel-Crafts alkylation difficult. This sequence is unlikely to yield the desired product.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly and efficiently lead to the desired product. However, **Option D** appears to be the closest, despite its flaws, as it includes the necessary substitution step (NaOH/EtBr) to introduce the ethoxy group.
