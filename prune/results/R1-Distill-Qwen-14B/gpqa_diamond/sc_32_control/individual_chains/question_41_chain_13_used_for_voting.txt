Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the speed of light in glass from the perspective of someone in the lab. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The setup is that a light beam is moving through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and it's moving towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light relative to the lab.

Wait a second, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c divided by n, right? Because the index of refraction n is c over the speed of light in the medium, v = c/n. So normally, without any movement, the speed of light in the glass would be 1/n, since c is taken as 1 here.

But wait, the glass is moving. So how does that affect the speed? I'm trying to recall if there's a relativistic effect here or if it's just a matter of adding velocities. Oh, right! The glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving through the glass at velocity u relative to the glass.

Wait, no, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light. So the light's speed in the lab frame would be the speed of the glass plus the speed of light in the glass relative to the glass. But I'm not sure if it's as simple as adding velocities because when velocities are significant compared to the speed of light, we need to use special relativity. But in this problem, the speed of light in the glass is 1/n, which is less than 1, so if v is much smaller than 1, maybe we can approximate. Or maybe the problem expects a classical approach, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed of light in the lab frame is just the same as in the glass, but that can't be right because the glass is moving. Wait, in special relativity, the speed of light remains c in all inertial frames. Oh wait, but c is 1 in this problem. So if the glass is moving, does the light's speed in the lab frame still equal 1? That seems likely because of the postulate of special relativity. Oh! So regardless of the medium's motion, the light's speed in the lab would still be c, which is 1 here.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The speed of light in the medium is v_medium = c/n. But from the lab's frame, the medium is moving. So the light's speed would be the sum of the medium's velocity and the light's velocity in the medium, but only in the direction of motion, right?

Wait, that's the Galilean addition of velocities. So if the medium is moving at v, and the light in the medium is moving at u = 1/n in the same direction, then the lab frame would measure the light's speed as u + v = (1/n) + v. But wait, that would be incorrect because when v is significant compared to c, you have to consider relativistic effects. But if v is much smaller than c (which is 1 here), then perhaps this approach is acceptable. But wait, the problem gives options where the answer could be B) 1, which would align with the speed of light being constant in all frames as per special relativity.

But wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let's think again. In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed 1/n. Now, the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. How does this affect the light's speed in the lab frame?

In special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The transformation between frames is done using the Lorentz velocity transformations. The formula for the velocity of an object in another frame is (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²). Wait, but u' would be the velocity of the object in the moving frame. Wait, no: if the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, and the light is moving at u = 1/n in the glass's frame in the same direction as the glass's motion, then in the lab frame, what is the speed?

Let me set up the variables. Let the lab frame be S, and the glass frame be S'. In S', the glass is stationary, and the light is moving at u' = 1/n. The glass is moving at v in S. So, applying the Lorentz transformation for velocities in the x-direction, we have:

u = (u' + v) / [1 + (u' v)/c² ]

But wait, since c=1 in this problem, the formula becomes:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' v )

Because c² is 1. So substituting u' = 1/n,

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) v )

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (1 + n v)/n

Denominator: (n + v)/n

So u = [ (1 + n v)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ] = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Wait, but wait. So the speed of light in the lab frame is (1 + n v)/(n + v). Looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v). But wait, that can't be right because in the lab frame, the speed of light should be c, which is 1. So what's going on here?

Oh wait a second. I must have messed up the setup. Because in the glass frame, the light's speed is 1/n, but in the lab frame, according to special relativity, the speed of light must still be 1. So my earlier approach can't be correct because it suggests a different speed.

Wait, but why? Because when I apply the velocity addition formula, I should get u = 1, since the speed of light must be c in all inertial frames. So where did I go wrong?

Ah, because the light is not moving in the same direction as the glass. Wait, no, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So perhaps I'm using the wrong transformation. Or maybe I should be considering the direction of the light.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the light's velocity in the glass's frame is in the same direction as the glass's velocity in the lab frame. So the transformation should correctly account for that, but I'm getting a different result. So why isn't the speed 1?

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the transformation. Let me double-check. The Lorentz velocity transformation for the x-direction is:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c²) )

But since c=1, this becomes:

u = (u' + v)/(1 + u' v )

But substituting u' = 1/n (the speed of light in the glass's frame), we get:

u = [ (1/n) + v ] / [ 1 + (1/n) v ]

But according to special relativity, this should equal 1. So:

[ (1/n) + v ] / [ 1 + (v/n) ] = 1

Multiply both sides by denominator:

(1/n + v) = 1 + (v/n )

Wait, 1 + v/n = same as (n + v)/n.

So 1/n + v = (1 + n v)/n.

Wait, so (1 + n v)/n = 1 + (v/n )? Let me compute both sides.

Left side: (1 + n v)/n = 1/n + v.

Right side: 1 + v/n.

So 1/n + v = 1 + v/n?

Wait, that can't be right unless v=0 and 1/n=1, which would mean n=1.

But the equation (1/n +v) = 1 + v/n implies:

1/n + v = 1 + v/n ⇒ 1/n - 1 = (v/n - v) ⇒ (1 -n)/n = v (1/n -1 ) = v ( (1 -n)/n )

So (1 -n)/n = (1 -n) v /n.

Assuming 1 -n is not zero (n ≠1), we can divide both sides by (1 -n)/n, giving 1 = v.

But that would require v=1, which is the speed of light, but the glass is moving at velocity v, which is less than c (since it's a glass moving normally). So unless v=1, which is the speed of light, but that's impossible for the glass.

Hmm, so this suggests that the equation only holds when v=1, which isn't the case. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait a minute, perhaps I should be considering that the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, but what if the glass's speed is negligible compared to c? Then perhaps I can approximate the velocity addition using a non-relativistic approach.

In the non-relativistic case, the speed of light in the lab frame would be approximately (1/n) + v. But that would imply the speed is higher than 1, which isn't possible because nothing can exceed the speed of light. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe in the lab frame, the speed of light is still 1, regardless of the glass's motion. Because according to special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. So the correct answer must be B) 1.

Wait, that makes sense. Because even though the glass is moving, the light's speed in the lab frame doesn't change. So the answer should be 1.

So looking at the options, option B is 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Speed of Light in the Medium**: In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is given by \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \), where \( n \) is the index of refraction of the glass.

2. **Motion of the Glass**: The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, toward the observer in the laboratory.

3. **Special Relativity Postulate**: According to the theory of special relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum (or any inertial frame) is constant and equal to \( c = 1 \). This means that even though the glass is moving, the speed of light relative to the observer in the laboratory remains \( c = 1 \).

4. **Relativistic Velocity Addition**: While the relativistic velocity addition formula could be applied in principle, it is unnecessary here because the speed of light is invariant in all inertial frames. Thus, the motion of the glass does not affect the observed speed of light in the laboratory frame.

5. **Conclusion**: Regardless of the glass's motion, the speed of light in the laboratory frame remains \( c = 1 \).

Thus, the correct answer is **B) 1**.
