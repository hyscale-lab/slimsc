Okay, so I've got this question about particle physics, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think. The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV, and the interaction Lagrangian is provided.

Hmm, the Lagrangian is L = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse this correctly. Oh, I think it's more like L = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y), but I might be getting the notation wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Either way, the important part is that the boson X interacts with certain fermions f.

So, the interaction term involves ψ_f, which are fermion fields. The mass term for the boson comes from somewhere else, probably the quadratic term in the Lagrangian. The boson X's mass is given as 6 GeV, which is key for determining its possible decay products.

Now, for a boson to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of each fermion in the pair. Because each fermion has rest mass, so if the boson's mass is M, the pair's combined mass must be less than or equal to M.

So I need to list all the possible fermions that have a mass less than or equal to M_X / 2. M_X is 6 GeV, so each fermion mass m must satisfy m <= 3 GeV.

Wait, what are the masses of the known fermions? Let me think. The up and down quarks are the lightest. The up quark is about 2.2 MeV, down is around 4.7 MeV. Then the strange quark is about 100 MeV, and the charm quark is around 1.3 GeV. The bottom quark is around 4.5 GeV. Top is way too heavy at 173 GeV. The electron is about 0.0005 GeV, muon ~0.1 GeV, tau ~1.77 GeV. Neutrinos are even lighter, but I think the problem is considering charged leptons because the interaction term is written with ψ_f, which are probably charged fermions.

Wait, but the interaction term is L = -λ f ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. Hmm, perhaps f is a fermion field, but I'm not sure if it's a Yukawa coupling. Wait, this looks a bit like a Yukawa interaction, which is a term that couples a scalar (or boson) to fermions. So for a Yukawa interaction, the boson (X) can decay into fermions if the fermions are light enough.

So for X to decay into a pair of fermions f and f-bar, the sum of their rest masses must be less than or equal to the mass of X. Since each fermion has mass m, their sum is 2m. So 2m <= M_X → m <= 3 GeV.

Let me list the fermion masses:

- Up quark: ~2.2 MeV → way below 3 GeV.
- Down quark: ~4.7 MeV → same.
- Strange quark: ~95 MeV → same.
- Charm quark: ~1.3 GeV → 1.3 < 3 → allowed.
- Bottom quark: ~4.5 GeV → 4.5 >3 → not allowed.
- Top quark: way too heavy, so no.
- Electron: 0.0005 GeV → allowed.
- Muon: ~0.1 GeV → allowed.
- Tau: ~1.77 GeV → 1.77 <3 → allowed.
- Neutrinos: very light, but since the interaction is with charged fermions, maybe they're not considered here.

Wait, but the interaction term has ψ_f, which are probably charged. So X can decay into any charged fermion-antifermion pair where each has mass <=3 GeV.

So which fermions are allowed?

Charged leptons:
- e+: mass ~0.0005 GeV
- mu+: ~0.1 GeV
- tau+: ~1.77 GeV
So all three are allowed.

Quarks:
- u: 2.2 MeV → allowed
- d: 4.7 MeV → allowed
- s: ~95 MeV → allowed
- c: 1.3 GeV → allowed
- b: 4.5 GeV → not allowed
- t: way too heavy → no.

Wait, but the options don't list 'u' and 'd' in the decay channels. Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: bb, ss, uu, dd, taus, electrons.
Option B: cc, ss, uu, dd, taus, mu, e.
Option C has tt, but that's too heavy, so X can't decay to top quarks. So option C is out.

Option D includes bb, which is 4.5 GeV each, so 9 GeV needed, which is way beyond X's mass. So X can't decay into b's.

So looking back, the allowed fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So the decay products would be pairs like e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar.

But looking at the options:

Option A lists X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, e. But b is too heavy, so option A isn't correct.

Option B: includes c cbar, s sbar, u, d, and the leptons tau, mu, e. So that seems correct.

Option D also includes b and mu and e, but b is too heavy. So the correct decay products are those where each fermion is <=3 GeV.

So in the options, option B lists X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e. So that's all allowed.

Wait, but option B is:

B) X→ c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, all these fermions have mass less than 3 GeV. So the allowed decay channels are the ones in option B.

Wait, but another thing: the interaction term must allow the coupling to each fermion. The Lagrangian given is -λ f ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. So this suggests that the interaction is between X and the fermion ψ_f. So, if ψ_f is, say, a charged lepton, then X can decay into that pair.

But wait, the way the Lagrangian is written, perhaps it's a Yukawa coupling term. Yukawa interactions allow for a boson to couple to a fermion-antifermion pair, enabling decays into that pair. So as long as the fermion's mass is low enough, the decay is allowed.

So the possible decay channels are all the fermion pairs where each fermion is less than or equal to 3 GeV in mass. So for each pair, 2m <=6 GeV → m <=3 GeV.

So the possible fermions are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

But looking at the options, which of these is correct.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Option D: includes b, which is too heavy.

Wait, but let me check the fermion masses once more.

Charm quark: about 1.3 GeV. So 2 * 1.3 = 2.6 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So yes, X can decay into c cbar.

Similarly, tau is about 1.77 GeV → 2*1.77 = 3.54 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau can be produced.

But wait, wait a second. The maximum possible mass for a pair is 6 GeV, so each fermion must be <=3 GeV. So for a tau, which is 1.77 GeV, that's okay because 2*1.77=3.54 <6. So tau is allowed.

So, all the allowed fermion pairs are c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Looking at the options, option B includes all of them except for the top and bottom, which are excluded. So option B is the correct choice.

Wait, but in the options, option A includes b, which isn't allowed, and option B doesn't. So the correct answer should be option B.

The question involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \), based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. The decay of \( X \) into fermion-antifermion pairs is governed by the condition that the total mass of the fermion pair must not exceed the mass of \( X \). For a fermion of mass \( m \), this requires \( 2m \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), or \( m \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses and Allowed Decays:
1. **Charged Leptons**:
   - Electron (\( e^- \)): \( m \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Muon (\( \mu^- \)): \( m \approx 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Tau (\( \tau^- \)): \( m \approx 1.77 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).

2. **Quarks**:
   - Up (\( u \)): \( m \approx 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Down (\( d \)): \( m \approx 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Strange (\( s \)): \( m \approx 95 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Charm (\( c \)): \( m \approx 1.3 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 2m > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
   - Top (\( t \)): \( m \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed).

3. **Neutrinos**: While neutrinos are very light, the interaction term involves charged fermions, so neutrinos are not considered here.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+\e^- \), all of which have fermion masses \( \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This option is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \rightarrow c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+\e^- \), as listed in **Option B**.
