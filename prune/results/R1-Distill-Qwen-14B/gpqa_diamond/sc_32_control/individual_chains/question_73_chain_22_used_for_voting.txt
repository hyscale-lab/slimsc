Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's break it down.

The question says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. Wait, but wait—relativistic speeds mean we can't just use classical mechanics. Oh right, I need to use special relativity equations here.

First, for the relative speed. I remember that when you have two objects moving in the same direction, you don't just subtract their speeds normally. Because of relativity, you have to use the velocity addition formula. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, but wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So the relative speed should be the difference, but considering relativity.

Wait, let me think. The first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, the second at 0.5c. So from the first's perspective, how fast is the second moving? Or wait, actually, the problem says "relative speed"—I'm not sure which astronaut is the reference. Wait, perhaps the question is about the speed of one as seen from the other. Let's suppose we're calculating the speed of the second astronaut from the first's frame. So v1 is 0.6c, and v2 is 0.5c. So using the formula, it's (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Calculating numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c. Hmm, looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c. So that's correct for the relative speed.

Now, the total energy of the system. The system is both astronauts, so I need to find the total relativistic energy. Each contributes their own energy, which is gamma*m*c². So I'll compute each astronaut's energy and sum them.

Starting with the first astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) → v=0.6c, so v²=0.36c². 1 - 0.36 = 0.64 → sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy for astronaut 1 is gamma*m_total*c². Wait, wait, his mass is 2m. So 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma for him: v=0.5c → v²=0.25 c². 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 → sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660. So gamma is 1/0.866 ≈ 1.1547, which is 2/sqrt(3) if I'm correct. Wait, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 2/sqrt(3) is about 1.1547.

So energy is gamma * mass * c² → 1.1547 * 3m * c² → 3.4641 m c².

Adding both energies: 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c². That's approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. So that matches. Option D has E=5 mc², which is lower. So the correct answer must be option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. Are the energies additive in the same frame? Oh yes, because both are measured in the same lab frame. The problem doesn't specify a different frame for each; it's just asking for the total energy of the system, which would be the sum of their energies in the same reference frame. So yes, adding them is correct.

So the relative speed is 0.14c and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². So option C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut:
- Mass: \(2m\)
- Speed: \(0.6c\)
- \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25\)
- Energy: \(E_1 = \gamma m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5m c^2\)

#### For the second astronaut:
- Mass: \(3m\)
- Speed: \(0.5c\)
- \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547\)
- Energy: \(E_2 = \gamma m c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.4641m c^2\)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**
