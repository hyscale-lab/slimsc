Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively. Both moving in the positive x-direction. So, first, I think I need to calculate their relativistic velocities and then figure out the relative speed between them.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Oh, right, when you're dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them normally because of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Newtonian addition doesn't work here because the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light.

So, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is u = (u1 - u2)/(1 - (u1 u2)/c²). Wait, but wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So the relative speed would be the difference between their speeds, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, no, wait. Let's get that straight. If both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed of the second from the first's frame would involve a calculation. Or am I getting it backwards?

Wait, maybe I should think about it this way: astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from A's perspective, what is B's speed?

Wait no, that's not right. Wait, the question is about the relative speed between them. So perhaps we need to find the speed of one as observed from the other's frame. But I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, but let's think. If both are moving in the same direction, but astronaut A is moving faster (0.6c) than astronaut B (0.5c). So from astronaut B's frame, astronaut A is moving away at (0.6c - 0.5c) = 0.1c? But wait, that's only in the non-relativistic case. Because in relativity, velocities don't just subtract like that. So I can't just do 0.6c - 0.5c. I have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the formula is for transforming velocities between frames. So if I have two objects moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be calculated using that formula. Let me get the formula right.

The formula for the relative velocity u (of object 1 as seen from object 2's frame) is u = (u1 - u2)/(1 - (u1 u2)/c²). Wait, but no, that's when you're changing frames. Wait, wait, perhaps I should think about it as the velocity of A as seen from B's frame.

Wait, no, the problem might be asking for the relative speed as in the speed between the two, which would be in the same direction. So if A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c, then in the lab frame, the relative speed between them is 0.1c. But wait, that's in the lab frame. But the question is about the relative speed, so perhaps I should compute it as per one astronaut's frame.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whose frame we're considering. Hmm. Let me read the question again: "What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?" So I think they are asking for the relative speed from one's frame to the other. Hmm.

Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, maybe the question is just asking the relative speed as observed from a lab frame. But I'm not sure. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is making a mistake, and says 'relative speed' when it should be just the difference. But maybe I should proceed with the relativistic calculation.

Wait, let me think. If we're in the lab frame, the relative speed between them is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question doesn't involve relative speed between the two, but each astronaut's speed in the lab frame. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the relative speed between the two when considering one astronaut's frame. For example, from A's frame, what is B's speed.

Wait, that seems more likely. Because if both are moving in the same direction, then in A's frame, B would appear to be moving in the same direction but slower, or perhaps even in the opposite direction.

Wait, no, if A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c, both same direction. So from A's frame, B's velocity would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c)(0.6c)/c^2) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/(0.7) ≈ -0.1428c. So the relative speed is 0.1428c, but in the opposite direction. Hmm, so the magnitude would be 0.143c.

Wait, so the relative speed is approximately 0.14c, but in the opposite direction. So the relative speed's magnitude is about 0.14c.

Wait, but in the options, option C and D have 0.14c. So that's a possible clue.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the Newtonian approach, but I don't think so because the speeds are a significant fraction of c.

Wait, maybe I should proceed to calculate that. Let me compute the relative speed between the two as seen from each other's frames.

So, the formula is u = (u1 - u2) / (1 - (u1 u2)/(c²)).

Wait, but in this case, u1 is the speed of B in the lab frame, and u2 is the speed of A in the lab frame. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about it.

The velocity addition formula in special relativity is:

u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²))

where u is the velocity of an object in the original frame, and v is the velocity of the original frame relative to the new frame. So, if I want to find the velocity of A as seen from B's frame, I need to set v as B's velocity, which is 0.5c.

Wait, no, because B is moving at 0.5c in the lab frame. So, the frame of B is moving at v = 0.5c relative to the lab frame.

So, the velocity of A in B's frame would be u' = (u_A - v_B) / (1 - (u_A v_B)/c²).

Where u_A is 0.6c, and v_B is 0.5c.

So, u' = (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²) = (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.14286c, or approximately 0.143c.

So, the relative speed is about 0.143c. So the magnitude is 0.14c. So in the options, that's either C or D.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². Option D is v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc².

Hmm. So the relative speed is 0.14c, so that narrows it down to options C and D.

Now, the second part of the question is the total energy of the system. I think that would involve calculating the relativistic energies of both astronauts and adding them together.

So, the total energy E_total is E1 + E2, where E1 is the total energy of astronaut 1, and E2 of astronaut 2.

The relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, for astronaut 1 (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So, E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut 2 (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So, E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So, E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches this.

So, putting it all together, the relative speed is approximately 0.14c and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². So the correct option is option C.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The astronauts are moving in the same direction with relativistic speeds of \( 0.6c \) and \( 0.5c \). The relative speed between them is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u_1 - u_2}{1 - \frac{u_1 u_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u_1 = 0.6c \) and \( u_2 = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
u = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.143c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
