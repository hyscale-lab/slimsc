Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's all about.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, G releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which is close to 0 degrees Celsius, right? Because 273 K is 0°C, so 277 is about 4°C. Hmm, I think I remember that from somewhere.

The product of a keto acid reacting with substance X has two oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. Oh, wait, I remember that something like KMnO4 or K2Cr2O7 are strong oxidizing agents used in organic reactions. But maybe that's a stretch.

So, let's break it down. Let me think about each part.

First, the reaction between X and Y. The reaction is violent and releases gas W. W's molecule has same protons and neutrons. So, if protons and neutrons are same, what elements or isotopes have that? For example, hydrogen has 1 proton, 0 neutrons (if it's ^1H) or 1 neutron (deuterium). But wait, the molecule must have same number of both. So for a molecule, each atom in it would have to have equal protons and neutrons.

Wait, perhaps looking for an element where the isotope has equal protons and neutrons. Like, oxygen-16 would have 8 protons and 8 neutrons. Or maybe another isotope. So, the gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons per atom. Wait, but the molecule could be something like O2 or H2, but for O, each atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (in O-16). So if W is O2, then each O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons, so same. Alternatively, maybe H2, but each H has 1 proton and 0 or 1 neutrons. So if it's deuterium, D2, then each D has 1 proton, 1 neutron. So same. So W could be either H2 (maybe but as gas?), O2, or maybe another molecule.

But earlier, the reaction of X with Y produces this gas. Let's think about what common reactions produce O2 or H2. If X is a metal, maybe reacting with an acid (Y is an acid), producing hydrogen gas. But if W is H2, then each molecule has H atoms with same number of protons and neutrons. But wait, H is light, but the question says X incorporates a heavier isotope. So perhaps X is a heavier isotope of a metal, like maybe potassium with a heavier isotope? Or perhaps another element.

Wait, the product of X and a keto acid gives a molecule with two oxygen atoms. So, if X is something like a base, perhaps reacting with a keto acid (which is an acid with a ketone group, like acetoacetic acid?), the product would involve some neutralization or something else, maybe forming water or another compound.

But let's go back to the reaction. X reacts with Y to produce gas W, precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B with a melting point near 277 K. Hmm, melting point of about 4°C. What substance has a melting point around there? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? Wait, no, that's higher. Or maybe something else. Wait, another thought: copper sulfate pentahydrate has a melting point around 277 K? Wait, I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe B is an element that has a melting point around that. Wait, maybe it's ice? No, ice melts at 273 K. So B could be something like ice, but the melting point is very close to 277 K. If it's 273 K, then it's water. But 277 is 4 degrees above, so maybe it's another compound.

Wait, maybe B is something like sodium chloride? No, that's way higher. Alternatively, think about the precipitate G. When heated, it releases B. So G is perhaps a hydrate that loses water upon heating, releasing B. For example, if G is a copper sulfate pentahydrate, heating it would release water and leave anhydrous copper sulfate. But then B would be water, but its melting point is 273 K. But in the question, B's melting point is near 277 K. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is something else. Let's think about what else has a melting point around 277 K. Maybe something like camphor? No, I think camphor's melting point is higher. Alternatively, maybe paraffin wax, but that's lower. Wait, maybe it's something like naphthalene? No, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps B is an element. What elements have melting points around that? Mercury is -39°C, which is 234 K. No, that's lower. Maybe another element. Let's check: for example, lead melts around 327°C, so way higher. Wait, maybe it's not an element. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is a compound like ammonium nitrate? No, that's way higher. Wait, another approach: let's think about what G is. If G is a precipitate that when heated releases B, which is a solid with a melting point near 277 K. So perhaps G is a metal hydroxide that, when heated, decomposes into a metal oxide and releases water. For example, copper hydroxide heating to copper oxide and water. But then B would be water, but its melting point is 273 K. The question says B's is near 277, so maybe 4 degrees higher. Not sure, but maybe that's a clue.

Wait, perhaps W is CO2? Because each CO2 molecule has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons in C-12), O (8 each). Wait, no. CO2 has each O as 8 protons and 8 neutrons (O-16), so each O in CO2 has same number of protons and neutrons. But the molecule as a whole would have 6 protons in C and 16 in each O, but the molecule's protons and neutrons don't directly matter, it's each atom in the molecule.

Wait, but the question says the gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So perhaps each atom in W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So for example, each atom in W has same number of p and n.

So, which elements have isotopes where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons? Let's think: for example, Chlorine-35 has 17 protons, 18 neutrons. No, that's not equal. But Chlorine-37 has 17 p, 20 n. No. Fluorine has 9 p and 10 n (like F-19). Not equal. Maybe another element.

Wait, oxygen has isotopes. O-16: 8 p, 8 n. So yes, same. So if W is O2, each O atom has 8p, 8n. That fits. So perhaps W is O2.

But then, in the reaction between X and Y, if it's producing O2, maybe Y is water or some peroxide. Or maybe Y is an acid, like H2O2?

Wait, but X is a substance that, when reacted with Y, produces O2. So maybe X is a metal like potassium or sodium, which reacts with water to produce H2 and maybe some hydroxide. But wait, that would produce H2, not O2.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: Y could be a solution of a salt, like a peroxide. Wait, but let's think about the reaction. If X is a metal, like potassium, and Y is a peroxide, maybe the reaction produces O2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is a chlorate or something else, and reacting it with an acid (like HCl) produces Cl2 gas, but that's not O2. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the product of X with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So, maybe X is a base that reacts with the keto acid to form a salt and water. For example, if X is NaOH and the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid, the product would have the acid's structure plus the hydroxide. But I'm not sure how that relates to the oxygen count.

Wait, perhaps the product is something like a carboxylic acid or its conjugate base. Or maybe it's a neutralization reaction, producing water. But the product contains two oxygen atoms. So perhaps it's H2O, but that's only one O. Or maybe another molecule with two O, like CO2? No, but that seems unrelated.

Wait, maybe the product is a peroxide. For example, if the keto acid is something that when reacts with X (like a metal), forms a peroxide. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonate. But that would need more O's, maybe.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the product is the keto acid deprotonated, but I'm not sure.

Let me try to think about the initial reaction again. So, X is a substance that incorporates a heavier isotope, meaning that maybe it's a diatomic molecule with one of its atoms being a heavier isotope. For example, H2O where one H is deuterium, making it D2O, but I don't know if that's relevant.

Wait, the product when X reacts with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Let's think: a keto acid is an acid with a ketone group. For example, acetoacetic acid has two carboxylic acid groups and a ketone in between. So, when it reacts with a base like X, perhaps it forms a salt. So, if X is a metal hydroxide, the reaction would neutralize the keto acid, producing a metal salt and water. The product would have O from the acid, but considering the product, perhaps it's releasing water or forming a specific salt.

Wait, but the problem says the product contains two atoms of oxygen. So maybe the product is H2O? But that's only one O. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a carbonate (CO3^2-), but that would require more O's. Or maybe it's another compound like CO2, but again, not sure.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach. Let's think about what substance X could be.

The question says that X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. So, think of common reagents. For example, KMnO4 is a strong oxidizing agent used in organic reactions. But is that X? Or perhaps another oxidizing agent like K2Cr2O7.

Wait, but if X is KMnO4, then Y could be an acid like HCl, which would react to produce MnCl2, etc., but I don't think that produces O2. Alternatively, when KMnO4 is heated in acidic conditions, it might produce Mn^2+ and release O2 gas. Oh wait, that's a possibility. So, in the reaction between KMnO4 and an acid like HCl, especially when heated, MnCl2, Cl2, and O2 might be produced. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, but the reaction with Y is violent. KMnO4 and HCl when mixed, especially in concentrated conditions, can react violently, producing Cl2 gas, MnCl2, and water. But would O2 be produced? Alternatively, if it's an acidic solution, maybe MnO2 is formed, but not O2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is sodium chlorate (NaClO3), which is a strong oxidizing agent. When it reacts with an acid, perhaps it produces ClO2 or ClO3, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, in the presence of a reducing agent, it might produce Cl2, but again, not O2.

Wait, another thought: if X is a peroxide, like H2O2. When H2O2 reacts with an acid, perhaps it decomposes, but I don't think that's a violent reaction. Alternatively, maybe Y is something else.

Wait, maybe the reaction is between a metal and an acid. For example, K reacting with H2O. But that would produce H2 gas. So W would be H2.

But then, each H atom in H2 has 1 proton and 1 neutron (if it's deuterium). So that would fit the condition where the gas's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons per atom. Because each H in H2 is D (deuterium), so 1p, 1n. So that works.

So let's suppose that W is H2, each H is D. So X is a heavier isotope-containing substance. So maybe X is K (potassium), which is a metal whose isotope is heavier. Wait, but K is a metal that reacts with water to produce H2. But then, the precipitate G would be K hydroxide, perhaps. When heated, K hydroxide might decompose, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the precipitate G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. If G is K hydroxide, heating it in a decomposition reaction might produce K oxide and water. But then B would be water, melting at 273 K, which is close to 277 K.

Hmm, that's possible. So perhaps the reaction is K reacting with water (Y is H2O?), producing H2 gas (W), K hydroxide (G), which when heated decomposes to K oxide (B) and H2O.

Wait, but K oxide is K2O, which has a melting point higher than 277 K. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps B is something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options.

The question is asking for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So, if X has elements A and B, with lightest and heaviest, sum their atomic masses.

So, I need to find out what elements are in X.

If X is K, then its constituent elements are K and maybe O if it's a compound. Wait, but K is a pure element, so X would be K metal. Then the elements present are only K. Hmm, but that can't be, because the problem says 'elements present within substance X'—so either K is the only element, but then the cumulative sum would be K's mass.

But the options are 35, 25, 31, 29. K's atomic mass is about 39, which isn't in the options.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound, like KClO3 or something else. For example, KMnO4 contains K, Mn, O. So the lightest is K (39), heaviest is Mn (55) or O (16)? Wait, no, Mn is heavier. So the sum would be 39 + 55 = 94, which isn't any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Another approach: The product of X with a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms. So, perhaps the product is a molecule with two O atoms. Maybe it's water (H2O), but that's one O. Or maybe it's something like carbonate, but that seems a stretch.

Wait, maybe the product is a salt, like Na2CO3? No, that's three O's. Alternatively, perhaps it's something like Na2O2, which has two O's, but that's a peroxide. So if the product is Na2O2, that would have two O atoms. But how would that form from a keto acid and X?

Alternatively, perhaps X is NaOH. When it reacts with a keto acid, it would form a sodium salt of the keto acid and water. The product (the salt) would have the structure RCOO^- Na^+, depending on the keto acid. But the product would have O's from the acid, but perhaps in the salt, but not necessarily two O's in a single molecule.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the starting point again.

Wait, the reaction produces a precipitate G, which when heated releases B. And B's melting point is near 277 K. If I can find B, that could help.

If B is water (H2O), melting point 273 K, but the question says it's near 277. Alternatively, maybe B is another compound. Let's think of something that melts around 277 K. Wait, maybe it's a type of sugar? No, that's way higher. Or maybe it's a type of oil or something else. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another thought: if when G is heated, it releases B, perhaps G is a hydrate. For example, copper sulfate pentahydrate loses water upon heating, leaving anhydrous copper sulfate. But then B would be water, but its melting point is 273 K. The question says B's melting point is near 277, which is 4 degrees higher, so perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe G is a carbonate that decomposes upon heating. For example, heating calcium carbonate produces CO2 and CaO. But then B would be CO2, which is a gas, not a solid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps G is a hydroxide. For example, heating sodium hydroxide doesn't change much, but heating copper hydroxide might decompose to copper oxide and water. So then B is water. But again, melting point is 273 K.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the problem statement again. The product when X reacts with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So maybe the product is something like CO2, but that's a gas. Or perhaps it's a carbonate, but again, not sure.

Wait, another angle: the product has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is a molecule like SO2, but that would require S and O. Alternatively, maybe NO2, but that's a possibility. But I'm not sure how that ties back to X.

Perhaps I should think about the options given. The options for the cumulative atomic masses are 35, 25, 31, 29.

Hmm, 25 is magnesium (24.3) approximately. 29 is maybe aluminum (27), but close. 31 is phosphorus. 35 is chlorine.

So, perhaps the elements are Cl and maybe another element. For example, if X is Cl and another element, like KCl, then K is 39, Cl is 35.5. So sum would be 74.5, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem says to sum the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So if X contains multiple elements, say, K and O, then K (39) is the heaviest, O (16) is the lightest. Sum is 55, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, if X is a compound with two elements, like KCl. K is 39, Cl is 35.5. Sum is 74.5, again not matching.

Wait, maybe X is a diatomic molecule with two isotopes. Hmm, but the question states that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So perhaps X is H2O, where one H is deuterium. Then the elements are H and O. H's atomic mass is about 1 (lightest), O is 16 (heaviest). Sum is 17, but that's not in the options.

Wait, another possibility: maybe X is a compound like NaNO3. Sodium nitrate. So elements are Na (23), N (14), O (16). The lightest is Na (23), heaviest is O (16)? No, Na is heavier than O. Wait, no, O is 16, Na is 23. So sum is 23 + 16 = 39, which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let's think about the reaction again. Let's say X is a strong oxidizing agent, like KmnO4, and Y is an acid. The reaction produces gas W, which could be O2. So, when KMnO4 reacts with an acid (like HCl), it produces MnCl2, Cl2 gas, and O2 gas. Wait, but HCl and KmnO4 usually produce Cl2, not O2. Alternatively, in a basic solution, MnO2 might form, but I'm not sure.

Wait, upon further thought, perhaps the reaction is between KmnO4 and HCl, which produces MnCl2, Cl2 gas, water, and maybe some other products. But when I think about it, I'm not certain if O2 is produced. Alternatively, maybe X is PbO2, which is used in certain reactions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a chlorate, like NaClO3. When it reacts with an acid, perhaps HCl, it might produce ClO2 or Cl2, but again, not O2.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what produces O2 as a gas. One common reaction is the decomposition of KClO3 upon heating with MnO2 as a catalyst, producing O2. But in that case, Y would be KClO3, X would be MnO2? No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and a strong oxidizing acid, which produces O2. But I'm not recalling the exact reaction.

Wait, let me think about the product. It's a precipitate G that, when heated, releases B. If G is a hydroxide that decomposes to a metal oxide and water, then B would be water. But then B's melting point is 273 K, which is 0 degrees Celsius. The problem says it's very close to 277 K, which is 4 degrees C. So, maybe B isn't water, but something else.

Wait, maybe B is a solid with a higher melting point than water. Alternatively, perhaps B is a salt that crystallizes at that temperature. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into CO2 and a metal oxide. But then B would be CO2, which is a gas, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: if B is a solid with a melting point near 277 K, perhaps it's a type of wax or paraffin. But I'm not sure about their melting points.

Alternatively, maybe B is something like camphor, which has a melting point around 178°C (about 451 K), which is way higher. So that's not it.

I think I'm stuck on identifying B. Let's try to think of what could have a melting point near 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C. So perhaps B is ammonium chloride? Wait, no, that's a higher melting point. Alternatively, perhaps it's something like sodium hydroxide? No, that's way higher.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think about the possible options again.

The options are 35, 25, 31, 29. So, perhaps the sum is 35 (Cl) and something else.

Wait, another thought: if X is K, then the cumulative sum is K plus another element. But I don't think another element is present in X if it's a pure element. So perhaps X is a compound.

Wait, maybe X is a diatomic molecule with one element, like O2. But the question says X incorporates a heavier isotope. So perhaps X is O2, but that's not a heavier isotope; O-18 is a heavier isotope of O. So X could be O2 with some O-18 in it. But then the elements present are only O, so the sum would be O's atomic mass times? No, the problem says the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X. So if X is O, the elements are only O, so sum is same as O's mass.

But O's atomic mass is around 16, so that's not in the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound made of Na and Cl, like NaCl. Then the elements are Na (23) and Cl (35.5). Sum is 58.5, which isn't in the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound like H2O with a heavier isotope. So, if X is H2O where one H is deuterium, then the elements are H and O. Sum of lightest (H: 1) and heaviest (O: 16) gives 17, which isn't in options.

Wait, but maybe X is something like CH3OH (methanol), but then the elements would be C, H, O. So lightest is H (1), heaviest is C (12), sum is 13, not in options.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about what the sum could be.

Looking at the options: 25 is close to Mg (24.3), 29 close to Al (27), 31 close to P (30.97), 35 close to Cl (34.96).

If the sum is 35, perhaps the elements are Cl (35) and something else. Wait, but 35 is an option itself (option A is 35). So perhaps the sum is 35, meaning the two elements sum to 35. So, possible pairs could be O (16) + Cl (19.5? No, that's not right. Wait, 16 + 19.5 is 35.5, which is close to 35. So maybe O and Cl? But O is 16, Cl is 35.5. So 16 + 35.5 is 51.5, which is higher than 35.

Wait, another pair: Na (23) and Mg (24.3). Sum is 47.3, no. Or maybe something like C (12) and O (16): sum is 28, not an option.

Wait, perhaps the elements are H and O? H (1) and O (16) sum to 17. Not in options.

Wait, maybe the elements are something else. If the sum is 35, perhaps the elements are F (19) and Cl (35.5): 19 +35.5=54.5, not 35. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the sum is 31. That would be, for example, O (16) and N (14): sum is 30, close but not 31. Or maybe O and S (32): 16+32=48, no. Alternatively, C (12) and O (16) sum to 28, not 31.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the options and see which sum could make sense.

Option C is 31. Maybe it's 31 as the sum. So, 31 could be, for example, 15 (like phosphorus? No, P is 31). Wait, phosphorus has an atomic mass of about 31, but that's for P itself. So if X contains P and another element, like O, then the sum would be P (31) + O (16) = 47, which is not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the elements are Cl (35.5) and something else. If the sum is 35, maybe the elements are Cl (35.5) and H (1.008), which sum to 36.5. Close to option A (35), but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the elements are Cl and another element with a lower mass, like F (19). 35.5 +19=54.5. Not matching any options.

Hmm, maybe the sum is 25. That could be Na (23) and O (16): sum is 39, no. Or maybe Mg (24) and O (16): 40. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X contains two elements, one of which is Cl (35.5) and another is F (19). Sum is 54.5, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the elements are K (39) and O (16). Sum is 55, which isn't an option.

Hmm, I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should think of the problem from another angle.

The product of X with a keto acid has two O atoms. Maybe the product is a carbonate, but that's three O's. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, but that's a stretch.

Wait, another angle: the product of X reacting with a keto acid has two O atoms. So perhaps it's CO2? But that would imply the reaction produces CO2, which would come from decarboxylation. Or maybe it's something else.

Wait, if X is a base, such as NaOH, reacting with a keto acid would produce a salt and water. The product would be a sodium salt of the keto acid. But how does that relate to two O atoms? The salt would have the keto acid's structure, which includes O's. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a hemiacetal or something else, but that's probably beyond the scope.

Hmm, perhaps the product is a carboxylic acid, which has two O's in the COOH group. But then the product would have more than two O's.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to think of X as a metal that when reacted with a keto acid, forms a salt with two O's. Not sure.

At this point, I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess.

Looking back, the options are 35, 25, 31, 29. I think the correct sum is 35 (option A), as Cl has a mass around 35.5, and maybe another element with a small mass, but perhaps the sum of the lightest and heaviest is 35. Alternatively, perhaps it's 29.

Wait, another angle: the product when X reacts with a keto acid has two O's. If the product is a carbonate, then maybe the sum is 35 (Cl and O). But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound like KClO3. Then, upon reaction with a keto acid, it might release ClO2 or something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a chloride and water. The product having two O's would be H2O, which has one O. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, but that's a stretch.

I think I'm going to have to make a best guess here. Based on the options, and considering that X is a reagent used in organic chemistry, perhaps it's KMnO4, which contains K (39) and Mn (55), and O (16). So the lightest element is K (39) wait no, K is heavier than O. Wait, no, O is lighter than K. So the elements are K (39), Mn (55), O (16). So the lightest is O (16), heaviest is Mn (55). Their sum is 71, but that's not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with Cl and another element. For example, Cl and H. So, HCl. Then the elements are H (1) and Cl (35.5). Sum is 36.5, which is close to option A (35). So maybe the answer is 35.

But wait, the question specifies that X incorporates a heavier isotope. So, if X is HCl, perhaps one of the H's is D, making it HDCl or DCl. But that doesn't change the elements present, just the isotopes.

So, the lightest element in X is H and the heaviest is Cl. Sum is 1 + 35.5 = 36.5. But the options don't have 36, so 35 is the closest option. So maybe the answer is A) 35.

Alternatively, perhaps X is NaCl. Then the elements are Na (23) and Cl (35.5). So the sum would be 23 + 35.5 = 58.5, not in options.

Hmm, I'm not confident, but perhaps the correct answer is 35.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X, which reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W, form precipitate G, and ultimately release B upon heating. B has a melting point very close to 277 K, and the product of X with a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms. Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons in each atom. This suggests W could be O₂ (oxygen-16, with 8 protons and 8 neutrons) or H₂ (deuterium, with 1 proton and 1 neutron). O₂ is more likely given the context of the reaction.

2. **Precipitate G and B**: G forms when X reacts with Y and releases B upon heating. B has a melting point near 277 K (approximately 4°C). This suggests B could be water (H₂O), as its melting point is 273 K, which is very close to 277 K. Thus, G might be a hydrated compound that loses water upon heating.

3. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product of X reacting with a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms. This could imply the formation of a salt or a compound like water (H₂O), which has one oxygen atom, but the exact identity of the product remains unclear.

4. **Substance X**: X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. This suggests X could be a compound like H₂O with a heavier isotope (e.g., D₂O) or a metal with an isotopic variant. X is also described as a reagent in organic chemistry, which aligns with its potential role as a base or oxidizing agent.

5. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**: The lightest and heaviest elements in X must be identified. If X contains hydrogen (H, atomic mass ~1) and oxygen (O, atomic mass ~16), the cumulative sum is 17. However, this does not match the given options. If X contains chlorine (Cl, atomic mass ~35.5) and another element like hydrogen, the sum is approximately 36.5, which is close to option A (35). This aligns with the possibility that X contains isotopes of Cl and H.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X are most consistent with option A (35), considering the potential presence of chlorine (Cl) and hydrogen (H) in X.
