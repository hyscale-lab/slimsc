Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again and figure out what it's asking. 

So, the problem is about a star similar to the Sun, right? Its radius is the same as the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. The setup is that when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing brightness variations that could look like an exoplanet transit. 

The question is asking: if instead of spots, there was an exoplanet causing the same brightness variation, what would be the radius of that planet relative to the star? The options are given as A to D.

Hmm. So I think this is about comparing the light curve amplitude caused by a planet transit (which blocks some light) and the variation caused by the spots. But wait, the spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the star appears dimmer. So maybe the effect is similar to a planet blocking light, but in the opposite way.

Wait, no. When a planet transits, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. Spots, when they are on the side facing us, would be cooler and emit less light, so the total brightness would be slightly lower. So the variation in brightness would be similar to a planet blocking the star's light. So the question is about finding the planet's radius such that the dip in brightness is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

But wait, the problem says that if the star wasn't covered by spots, what exoplanet radius would produce the same signal. So the scenario is comparing two situations: one with spots and one with a planet. Both cause a brightness variation of the same amplitude.

So I need to calculate the fractional change in brightness for both cases and set them equal.

First, let's think about the planet transit scenario. When a planet passes in front of a star, the dip in brightness is given by (Rp/Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

Now, for the star with spots: when a spot is on the hemisphere facing us, it's cooler. The spots have a filling factor of 20%, which I think means they cover 20% of the visible hemisphere. Wait, the star's one hemisphere is covered, so the total area covered by spots is 20% of the hemisphere. But wait, the star is a sphere, so the total surface area is 4πR². The hemisphere is 2πR², and 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the total area covered by spots is 0.4πR².

But each spot is cooler. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K. The flux from the star without spots is L = 4πR² * σTeff^4. But with spots, the flux is slightly less.

Wait, the brightness variation arises because when the spots are facing us, the star appears dimmer. So the maximum dip occurs when the spots are fully on the near side. Wait, but the star is rotating, so maybe the spots come into view as the star rotates. So the observed brightness would dip periodically as spots rotate into and out of view.

But in terms of the brightness variation, how do we model it? The star's brightness without spots is L. With spots, the brightness when the spots are on the near side is L - (fraction of spots) * (difference in flux per unit area).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the fractional change in flux. The fractional change (ΔF/F) when a spot is visible would be the area of the spot times the difference in flux per unit area between the spot and the rest of the star.

So, the fractional change in brightness when the spots are on the near hemisphere is:

ΔF/F = (Area of spots) * (ΔF_spot / F_star)

Where ΔF_spot is the per unit area flux difference between the spotted area and the rest.

Wait, each spot has a lower temperature, so each spot emits less flux. The flux per unit area for the star is F = σTeff^4. For the spot, it's F_spot = σ(Teff - ΔT)^4.

So the change in flux per spot area is F - F_spot = σ (Teff^4 - (Teff - ΔT)^4).

The total area of the spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

So the fractional change is:

ΔF/F = (0.4πR²) * [σ (6000^4 - 5000^4)] / (4πR² σ 6000^4 )

Wait, because the total flux of the star is 4πR² σ Teff^4. 

Let me compute this step by step.

The star's total flux without spots is F = σTeff^4 * 4πR².

The spots' total flux when visible is F_spot = σ(Teff - ΔT)^4 * (Area of spots).

So the change in flux is ΔF = F - F_spot = σTeff^4 *4πR² - (σ(Teff - ΔT)^4)(0.4πR²).

The fractional change is ΔF/F = [ (4πR² σ Teff^4) - (0.4πR² σ (Teff - ΔT)^4) ] / (4πR² σ Teff^4 )

Simplify numerator:

= (4πR² σ Teff^4) * [1 - (0.4/(4)) * ( (Teff - ΔT)^4 / Teff^4 ) ]

Wait, because 0.4πR² is 0.4/(4) of 4πR² (which is the star's total area). So 0.4/4 = 0.1.

So,

ΔF/F = [1 - (0.1 * ( (5000/6000)^4 )) ]

Wait, (5000/6000)^4 is (5/6)^4.

Let me compute (5/6)^4. 5^4 is 625, 6^4 is 1296. 625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So 0.1 * 0.482253 ≈ 0.048225.

So ΔF/F ≈ 1 - 0.048225 ≈ 0.951775.

Wait, but ΔF is the change in flux when spots are visible. So when the spots are visible, the flux is lower. So the fractional change is ΔF/F = -0.048225, but as a magnitude, it's about 4.82%.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. 

Wait, when the spots are on the near side, the flux is lower than when they are on the far side. So the maximum dip would be when the spots are covering as much as possible.

Wait, but the calculation I did above is the total fractional change when all the spots are visible on the near side.

So the fractional change in brightness is about (0.048225) or 4.82% decrease. So the amplitude of the brightness variation would be about 4.82% of the star's flux.

Wait, but the star's brightness varies as the spots rotate into and out of view. So the maximum dip would be when the spots are all on the visible hemisphere. So the amplitude is (ΔF/F) = ~4.82%.

But wait, when the star is not spotted, the dip caused by a planet would be (Rp/Rstar)^2.

We need to set the dip caused by the planet equal to the dip caused by the spots.

So:

(Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.048225.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.048225) ≈ 0.2196.

Wait, but none of the options are 0.22. Let's check the options:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Wait, wait, I'm getting about 0.22, but it's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me go back.

Wait, the fractional change in flux when the spots are present is (ΔF/F) = (Area of spots) * ( (F_spot - F_star) / F_star )

Wait, F_spot is the flux per unit area for the spot. So F_spot = σ(Teff - ΔT)^4.

F for the star is F = σTeff^4.

So (F_spot / F) = (Teff - ΔT)^4 / Teff^4.

So the change per unit area is F - F_spot = F*(1 - (Teff-ΔT)^4 / Teff^4 )

So the total change is (Area_spots) * (F*(1 - ... )) / F = Area_spots * (1 - ... )

Wait, let me think again.

The fractional change in flux when the spots are visible is:

ΔF/F = Area_spots * (F_spot - F) / F

But F_spot is less than F, so (F_spot - F) is negative, so ΔF/F is negative, meaning a flux decrease.

So, substituting:

ΔF/F = (0.4π R²) * [σ (Teff - ΔT)^4 - σ Teff^4 ] / (4π R² σ Teff^4 )

Simplify:

The R², σ terms cancel.

= (0.4π) * ( (5000)^4 - 6000^4 ) / (4π * 6000^4 )

Wait, (5000^4 - 6000^4) is negative. So,

ΔF/F = (0.4/4) * ( (5000^4 - 6000^4) ) / (6000^4 )

= 0.1 * [ (5000^4 /6000^4 ) - 1 ]

= 0.1 * [ (5/6)^4 - 1 ]

Because 5000/6000 =5/6.

So 5/6 is approximately 0.8333.

(5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So,

ΔF/F = 0.1 * (0.482253 - 1) = 0.1 * (-0.517747) ≈ -0.0517747.

So the fractional change is about -5.177% when the spots are fully visible.

Wait, so the amplitude is about 5.18% dip. So the planet's transit would cause a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276, which is about 0.23.

But that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is ~0.11. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the area calculation.

Wait, the star's radius is the same as the Sun's, Rstar = R_sun. The filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So the area covered is 20% of the hemisphere's area. The hemisphere is 2π R². So 20% is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, that's the same as before. So I think the area is correct.

But perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let's think again.

When a planet transits, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So if the dip from the planet is equal to the dip from the spots, then (Rp/Rstar)^2 = |ΔF/F|.

Wait, |ΔF/F| is about 0.0518, so (Rp/Rstar)^2=0.0518, so Rp/Rstar= sqrt(0.0518)= ~0.2276. 

But looking back at options, the closest I have is option C is 0.11, D is 0.32. Hmm. None match. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the area. The filling factor is 20% for the entire star's surface, or for the hemisphere?

Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * (2π R²) =0.4 π R². So that part is correct.

Wait, maybe I should model the brightness variation in a different way. Maybe the spots are on one hemisphere, but as the star rotates, only part of the spots come into view. Wait, but the problem says that it's only one hemisphere that's spotty. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view as the near side. So the maximum dip is when all the spots are on the near side.

But perhaps the model is that the spots are on a single hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots rotate into and out of the view. So the maximum dip would be when the entire spot area is on the near side. So the calculation I did is correct.

But I'm getting 0.227, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: when calculating the dip, perhaps I should consider that the spots cause a decrease in brightness, which is equivalent to a planet causing an increase in brightness? No, that doesn't make sense. No, the spots make the star dimmer, same as a planet blocking light.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of (5/6)^4. Let me compute it precisely.

5^4 is 625.

6^4 is 1296.

So 625/1296 is approximately 0.482253. So that's correct.

So 0.1 * (0.482253 -1 )= -0.0517747.

So the dip is about 5.18% of the star's brightness.

So the planet's radius must be such that (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518.

So Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276, or about 0.23.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's surface isn't entirely covered, but only a part. Wait, no, the problem says the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere.

Wait, maybe I should think about the light curve amplitude in terms of the spot being on the surface as the star rotates. So perhaps the variation in brightness is a sinusoidal function due to the spots rotating into and out of view. But the amplitude would be the same as the dip calculation.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the difference in flux between when the spots are on the near side and the far side.

Wait, the star's flux when the spots are on the far side is F = F_star (normal).

When the spots are on the near side, the flux is F = F_star - (spots area) * (F_spot per area).

Which is what I did earlier.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the variation in brightness as the spots rotate in, so the change in brightness is a function of the spot's size and the rotational period. But the amplitude of the dip is the same regardless of rotation speed, as long as the spot is fully on or off.

Another possibility is that I made a mistake in the area calculation. Wait, the hemisphere's area is 2π R². 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R², which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fractional change as (Area_spots) * (F_spot - F) / F.

Which I did, and that gives 0.4π R² * (F_spot - F) / F.

But F_spot is less than F, so the change is negative.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the dip as (F - F_spot) / F = 1 - (F_spot) / F.

Which is the same as 1 - (5000^4 /6000^4 ) multiplied by (Area_spots / (4π R²)).

Wait, wait, maybe the correct approach is:

The fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (Area_spots) / (4π R²) = (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.1 (10%).

So 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots.

The flux from the spots is F_spot = σ (Teff - ΔT)^4.

The flux from the rest of the star is F_rest = σ Teff^4 * (1 - 0.1) = 0.9 * σ Teff^4.

Wait, but when the spots are on the far side, the entire star's surface emits at Teff. When spots are on the near side, the flux is (0.9 * σ Teff^4) + (0.1 * σ (Teff - ΔT)^4 ).

So the flux when spots are on the near side is F = 0.9 F_total + 0.1 F_spot.

The normal flux is F_total = F = σ Teff^4 * 4π R².

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the fractional change as:

(F_nospots - F_spots_visible) / F_nospots.

F_nospots = F_total.

F_spots_visible = (area without spots) * F_star + (area with spots) * F_spot.

So F_spots_visible = (1 - 0.1) F_total + 0.1 F_spot.

So, F_spots_visible = 0.9 F_total + 0.1 F_spot.

So the change is:

ΔF = F_nospots - F_spots_visible = F_total - (0.9 F_total + 0.1 F_spot) ) = 0.1 (F_total - F_spot).

So,

ΔF = 0.1 (F_total - F_spot).

Then,

ΔF / F_total = 0.1 (1 - F_spot / F_total ).

Which is same as before.

F_spot / F_total = (5000^4 / 6000^4 ) * (0.1) [since F_spot is per unit area and the area is 10% of the star].

Wait, no.

Wait, F_spot is per unit area, but the spots cover 10% of the star's surface. So the total flux from spots is F_spot * 0.1 * 4π R².

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me re-approach.

The star's total flux is F_total = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

The flux without any spots is F_total.

When some spots are visible, the flux is F_visible = F_rest + F_spots.

F_rest is the flux from the 90% of the star not covered by spots: F_rest = 0.9 * 4π R² σ Teff^4.

F_spots is the flux from the spots: 0.1 * 4π R² σ (Teff - ΔT)^4.

So,

F_visible = 0.9 * F_total + 0.1 * F_total * (Teff - ΔT)^4 / Teff^4.

So,

F_visible = F_total [ 0.9 + 0.1 ( (5000/6000)^4 ) ]

So,

F_visible = F_total [0.9 + 0.1 * (5/6)^4 ].

Compute (5/6)^4 = 625 / 1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So,

F_visible = F_total [0.9 + 0.1 * 0.482253 ] = F_total [0.9 + 0.0482253 ] = F_total * 0.9482253.

So, the fractional change is:

ΔF/F = F_total - F_visible = F_total (1 - 0.9482253 ) = 0.0517747, or 5.177%.

So, the dip is about 5.18% of the star's brightness.

Now, for the planet, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So,

(Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517747 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0517747) ≈ 0.2276.

But the options don't have 0.23. So perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, the options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm. None of these are 0.2276. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the variation in brightness due to the spots, which may not be the same as the planet's transit. Let's think differently.

Wait, when a planet transits, the dip is when the planet blocks light. The dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

But the spots are cooler, so when the spots are on the far side, the star is brighter, and when they are on the near side, the star is dimmer. So the maximum brightness is when the spots are on the far side, and the minimum when they are on the near side.

Wait, that's actually the opposite of what I thought earlier. Because when the spots are on the far side, the star's face we see is hotter, so more flux. When they are on the near side, we see cooler spots, so less flux.

So the brightness variation is a maximum when spots are on the far side, and minimum when on the near side. So the amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/F.

Wait, wait. The star's flux without spots is F0.

When spots are on the far side, all the spots are on the far side, so the flux is F0 (since the spots are on the far side, their lower flux doesn't affect us).

When the spots rotate to the near side, the flux is F = F0 - (flux from spots on near side) + (flux not covered by spots on near side).

Wait, that's getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach should be to model the brightness variation as a function of the spots' coverage.

When the spots are fully on the far side, the flux is F0.

When the spots are fully on the near side, the flux is F = (area without spots) * F_Teff + (area with spots) * F_spot.

So,

F = [ (1 - f) * F_total ] + [ f * F_spot ]

Where f is the filling factor (0.2) but wait, no.

Wait, the filling factor f is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So when the star is viewed from Earth, the hemisphere facing us has f fraction covered by spots. The other hemisphere is completely spot-free.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused about how the filling factor applies. Let me restate:

The star has a radius equal to the Sun. One hemisphere (like the front) has spots covering 20% of its area. The other hemisphere is spot-free.

When the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view and then goes away.

So the maximum brightness occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, no. The star's brightness as seen from Earth is the sum of the flux from the hemisphere facing us and the flux from the far side, which we can't see. Wait, no, because the star is a sphere. The flux we receive is the sum of all the flux from the surface that's visible. So when a new hemisphere comes into view, the flux changes.

But perhaps a better approach is to model the brightness variation as the spotted hemisphere coming into view. So when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is directly facing us, we see the maximum area of spots, leading to a dip in brightness.

Wait, but I'm getting more confused. Let me think again.

The star has a single hemisphere with spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The other hemisphere is spot-free.

When the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere is sometimes visible, sometimes not.

The brightness variation would be due to the spots being in the part of the hemisphere we can see.

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots, causing a dip. When the other hemisphere is facing us, we don't see any spots, so the brightness is normal.

So the maximum dip is when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible, and the maximum brightness is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us.

So the amplitude of the dip is the difference between F_normal and F_spotty.

Wait, no. F_normal is the flux when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us. F_spotty is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, but the star is a sphere, so the flux is the sum of all the flux from the surface. So when one hemisphere is facing us, we receive half the star's flux. Wait, no, because the star's radius is fixed, and the flux is from the entire surface.

Wait, perhaps I should treat the star as a blackbody radiator, and each point on the surface emits according to its temperature.

So, the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is:

F_spotty = (Area of spotted hemisphere without spots) * F_Teff + (Area of spots) * F_spot.

But the area of the hemisphere is 2π R². 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

So,

F_spotty = [ (2π R² - 0.4π R² ) * F_Teff ] + [ 0.4π R² * F_spot ]

= [1.6π R² F_Teff ] + [0.4π R² F_spot ]

The total flux when the unspotted hemisphere is facing is F_unspotty = 2π R² F_Teff.

Wait, no, because the star's total flux is 4π R² F_Teff. When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, we see 2π R² F_Teff (the front hemisphere) and the back hemisphere is not visible. Wait, no, because the star emits light from all sides. So the observed flux is the sum of all the light from the surface that's visible from Earth.

Wait, I think I need to think about how much of the star's surface is visible. When the star is viewed face-on, we see half the surface (the front hemisphere). The back hemisphere is not visible. So the flux we receive is the sum of the flux from the front hemisphere.

So when the front hemisphere is the spotted one, the flux is:

F_spotty = (Area without spots on front) * F_Teff + (Area of spots) * F_spot.

Which is (2π R² * 0.8) * F_Teff + (2π R² * 0.2) * F_spot.

= 1.6π R² F_Teff + 0.4π R² F_spot.

But this is for the front hemisphere.

The normal flux (when unspotted hemisphere is front) is 2π R² F_Teff.

So the dip is (F_unspotty - F_spotty).

Wait, no, F_spotty is when the spotted hemisphere is front, which is when the spots are visible, leading to a lower flux.

So F_spotty = (2π R²)(0.8 F_Teff + 0.2 F_spot )

And F_unspotty = 2π R² F_Teff.

So the dip (ΔF) is F_unspotty - F_spotty.

ΔF = 2π R² F_Teff - [2π R² * 0.8 F_Teff + 2π R² * 0.2 F_spot ]

= 2π R² [ F_Teff (1 - 0.8 ) - 0.2 F_spot ]

= 2π R² [ 0.2 F_Teff - 0.2 F_spot )

= 0.4 π R² ( F_Teff - F_spot )

The fractional change is ΔF / F_unspotty.

F_unspotty is 2π R² F_Teff.

So,

ΔF / F_unspotty = [0.4 π R² (F_Teff - F_spot ) ] / [2 π R² F_Teff ]

= (0.4 / 2 ) * (F_Teff - F_spot) / F_Teff )

= 0.2 * (1 - F_spot / F_Teff )

F_spot / F_Teff = (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So,

ΔF / F_unspotty = 0.2 * (1 - 0.482253 ) = 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.10355.

So the fractional dip is about 10.355%.

Wait, that's much larger than what I calculated before. So earlier approach was wrong.

So the dip is about 10.35%.

So then, for the planet, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355.

So Rp = Rstar * sqrt(0.10355) ≈ Rstar * 0.3218.

Which is approximately 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32. So that would be the answer.

Wait, that makes sense. Now, in the earlier approach I thought that the dip was about 5.18%, but that was when the spots were on the near side, but I had a wrong model of how the flux is calculated.

So the correct approach is to model the star as having one hemisphere (front) with spots, and when that hemisphere is facing us, the flux is lower. The dip is the difference between the flux when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us and when the spotted hemisphere is.

So the dip is 10.35%, which corresponds to a planet radius of ~0.32 times the star's radius.

So the answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with spots, we analyze the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots and equate it to the dip caused by the planet's transit.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Star with Spots**:
   - The star has a radius equal to the Sun's radius, and one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler at 5000 K.
   - The total flux from the star without spots is \( F_{\text{total}} = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \).
   - When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is reduced because the spots emit less flux. The flux from the spotted hemisphere is:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotty}} = (0.8 \cdot F_{\text{total}}) + (0.2 \cdot F_{\text{spot}})
     \]
     where \( F_{\text{spot}} = \sigma (5000)^4 \) and \( F_{\text{total}} = \sigma (6000)^4 \).
   - The fractional change in brightness when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F} = 0.2 \cdot \left( 1 - \frac{F_{\text{spot}}}{F_{\text{total}}} \right)
     \]
     Substituting \( \frac{F_{\text{spot}}}{F_{\text{total}}} = \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \approx 0.482253 \), we find:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F} \approx 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.482253) \approx 0.10355 \, \text{(or 10.355%)}.
     \]

2. **Exoplanet Transit**:
   - The dip in brightness caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = \frac{\Delta F}{F}.
     \]
   - Setting the dip caused by the planet equal to the dip caused by the spots, we solve for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218.
     \]

3. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated radius ratio \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx 0.32 \) matches option **D**.

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately **0.32**.
