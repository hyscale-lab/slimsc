Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. 

The RV method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, right. So I remember that the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The formula I recall is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K, which relates to the planet's mass and the orbit.

Wait, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is K = (v) = (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/(2π)) )? Or maybe another version. Oh wait, I think the formula is:

K = [ (G * P) / (2π) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) )

But I might be mixing up some parts. Alternatively, I think it's more accurate to write it as K = [ (G * M_p) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) ) * (P)^(-1/3) )

Wait, no, maybe I should think about the relation between K and the period P. Because the question is about the ratio of periods.

Wait, the Doppler shift is caused by the star's velocity, which is K. And K is inversely proportional to the period, I think. Because if a planet has a longer period, the star's velocity would change more slowly, so a smaller K. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, let me think about the formula. The formula for K is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (4 * c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, maybe I should look for a proportionality relation. Since the stars are the same mass (same as Sun), and the planets have similar masses (Neptune), so M_p is same for both (assuming sin i is same, which I guess we can because the question says they detected both, so probably similar inclinations? Or maybe not, but the question probably assumes that the inclination is the same or that the effect is the same, so sin i is same for both.

So given that, the K is proportional to (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * 1/(P^(1/3) )

But since M_star is same for both, and M_p is same for both, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). Therefore, P ∝ 1/K^(3).

Wait, so if K1 is 5 milliangstrom and K2 is 7, then K2/K1 = 7/5.

But since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to 1/(K^(3)).

Wait, let's see. Let's denote K1 for planet 1, K2 for planet 2.

Given that K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1 = (some constant) * (1/P1^(1/3)), K2 = ... * (1/P2^(1/3)).

So K1 / K2 = [P2/P1]^(1/3).

So, [P2/P1]^(1/3) = K1/K2.

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, or is it the other way around? Because K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), so larger K means smaller P. So if K2 is larger than K1 (7>5), then P2 should be smaller than P1. Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer P2 is than P1. So if P2 is smaller, then the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1.

Wait, let's re-examine the exact proportionality.

If K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * 1/(P^(1/3)), then:

K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

So, K1 = C / P1^(1/3)
K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

That's because dividing the two, (C/P1^(1/3)) / (C/P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So rearranging, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

We can solve for P2/P1.

Take both sides to the power of 3:

(K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

Wait no, let's see:

If (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3), then cube both sides:

(K1/K2)^3 = (P2/P1).

Wait, no—wait, (x)^(1/3) is equal to (some value), so when you cube both sides, you get x = (some value)^3.

So,

(K1/K2)^3 = (P2/P1).

So,

P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

So,

P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3.

Wait, because (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3.

So the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3?

Wait, but 5/7 is about 0.714. Cubed is about 0.364.

So, P2 is about 0.364 times P1. Which means P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So the ratio is P2/P1, which is ~0.36, so P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. So it's shorter.

Which would mean that the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times the period of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter, so the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't flip anything. Because the question says, how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1.

So if the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1, then it's shorter, so it's not longer. So the answer would be 0.36 times as long, so the ratio is 0.36, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I have the ratio backward. Let me double-check.

Wait, the formula is K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

So, K1 = C / P1^(1/3)
K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

Taking the ratio K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So,

P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, so if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K1/K2 is 5/7.

So, (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 = 0.364. So P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1.

Which means P2 is shorter, so the orbital period of planet #2 is only about 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1. So the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's 0.36 times, so shorter. So the answer is 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options: A is ~0.36, D is ~0.85. So answer A is correct.

To determine how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift caused by the gravitational pull of the planet on the star. The semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), meaning:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), we can write the ratio of \( K_1 \) to \( K_2 \) as:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{P_2}{P_1}^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging for \( P_2 / P_1 \), we cube both sides:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \right)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3
\]

Calculating \( \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714 \), and cubing this value:

\[
\left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, \( P_2 \) is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of \( P_1 \). This means the orbital period of Planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer \( P_2 \) is compared to \( P_1 \), the answer is approximately 0.36.
