Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem about eigenvectors. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully. The problem says that we have a quantum mechanical operator P with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The task is to find the normalized eigenvector for the operator P (which I think is a vector operator) along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, wait. Wait, quantum operators can be a bit tricky. So, P is a vector operator, meaning it's like the components P_x, P_y, P_z come together to form a vector. So, the operator along an arbitrary direction n would be the dot product of P with the unit vector n. That is, P ⋅ n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. So the operator we're interested in is n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

The muon is a spin-1/2 particle, so the spin operators are involved here. Because spin-1/2 systems have eigenvalues ± ħ/2 for their components. So, the problem states that the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so the eigenvector corresponds to the spin-up state along direction n.

Now, the goal is to find the eigenvector of this operator (P ⋅ n) with eigenvalue +ħ/2. To find the eigenvector, I think I need to solve (P ⋅ n)|v> = (ħ/2)|v>. Since the eigenvector is normalized, we can proceed.

Wait, but the direction n is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. So the unit vector n can be parameterized as (n_x, 0, n_z) because it's in the x-z plane. Wait, actually, no, wait. Wait, if the direction is in the x-z plane, then the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and the direction can be written as (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since it's in the x-z plane, phi (φ) should be zero or 180 degrees? Or wait, no. Wait, the x-z plane has points where y=0. So n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). But since it's a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

Alternatively, we can represent n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So that's how n can be written.

So the operator along n is P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but wait, the P operator is given. Let me write down the components:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So calculating P_n as n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So substituting n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ (since n is unit vector in x-z plane), then:

P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let's compute that matrix:

The first term is sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] → [[0, sinθ],[sinθ, 0]]
The second term is cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] → [[cosθ, 0],[0, -cosθ]]

Adding them together:

P_n = (ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
                [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

So the matrix for P_n is (ħ/2) times [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]].

Now, we need to find the eigenvector of this matrix corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So, the eigenvalue equation is:

P_n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalue is (ħ/2), so the matrix equation would be:

[ [ (cosθ)(ħ/2), (sinθ)(ħ/2) ],
  [ (sinθ)(ħ/2), (-cosθ)(ħ/2) ] ] * [v1; v2] = (ħ/2) [v1; v2]

Divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] * [v1; v2] = [v1; v2]

So, the matrix equation becomes:

cosθ * v1 + sinθ * v2 = v1
sinθ * v1 - cosθ * v2 = v2

So, writing these as equations:

1) cosθ v1 + sinθ v2 = v1 → (cosθ - 1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0
2) sinθ v1 - cosθ v2 = v2 → sinθ v1 + ( -cosθ - 1 ) v2 = 0

Hmm, but I can treat these as a system of equations. Let me subtract the terms:

From equation 1: (cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0
From equation 2: sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 = 0

But wait, since it's a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors satisfy (M - λI) v = 0, where M is the matrix, λ is the eigenvalue. So in this case, λ is 1 (since we divided by ħ/2). Because the eigenvalue for P_n is +ħ/2, so dividing by ħ/2, the eigenvalue is 1.

So the matrix (M - λ I) for λ=1 is:

[ cosθ - 1, sinθ ]
[ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ]

So, the equations are:

(cosθ - 1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0
sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 = 0

These are two equations. Let me take the first equation and express v1 in terms of v2.

Equation 1: (cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0 → v1 = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] v2

Wait, because (cosθ -1) is -(1 - cosθ), so we can write:

(cosθ -1) = -(1 - cosθ) = -(1 - cosθ)

So equation 1 becomes:

- (1 - cosθ) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0 → (1 - cosθ) v1 = sinθ v2 → v1 = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] v2

Hmm, but 1 - cosθ is 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ is 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So substituting:

v1 = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) / (2 sin²(theta/2)) ) ] v2 = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] v2 = cot(theta/2) v2

Alternatively, I can write v1 = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] v2 → multiply numerator and denominator by (1+cosθ):

[ sinθ (1 + cosθ) ] / [ (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ) ) ] → [ sinθ (1 + cosθ) ] / (1 - cos²θ) ) → [ sinθ (1 + cosθ) ] / sin²θ → (1 + cosθ)/sinθ.

So v1 = [ (1 + cosθ)/sinθ ] v2 → since (1 + cosθ) = 2 cos²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2), this becomes:

[ 2 cos²(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] → cot(theta/2)

So v1 = cot(theta/2) v2.

Let me let v2 be a parameter, say, v2 = 1 (for simplicity, since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar). Then v1 = cot(theta/2).

So the eigenvector is [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

Wait, but we can write this as (cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), 1 ). Alternatively, to make it more manageable, perhaps we can express it in terms of sin and cos.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's easier to choose v2 = sin(theta/2), so v1 = cos(theta/2). Then the eigenvector becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, let me check. Let me take v1 = cos(theta/2), v2 = sin(theta/2). Let me plug into equation 1:

(cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0.

cos(theta) = 2 cos^2(theta/2) -1. So, cosθ -1 = 2 cos^2(theta/2) - 2 = 2 (cos^2(theta/2) -1 ) = -2 sin^2(theta/2).

So equation 1 becomes:

-2 sin^2(theta/2) * cos(theta/2) + sinθ * sin(theta/2) = ?

Sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So substituting:

-2 sin^2(theta/2) cos(theta/2) + [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] * [ sin(theta/2) ] = 

Simplify each term:

First term: -2 sin^2 (theta/2) cos(theta/2)
Second term: 2 sin^2(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

Adding them: (-2 + 2) sin^2(theta/2) cos(theta/2) = 0. So equation 1 is satisfied.

Similarly, equation 2: sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 = 0.

Substituting v1 = cos(theta/2), v2 = sin(theta/2):

sinθ * cos(theta/2) + (-cosθ -1) sin(theta/2) = ?

Again, sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2), and cos theta = 2 cos^2(theta/2) -1.

So:

2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) * cos(theta/2) + [ - (2 cos^2(theta/2) -1 ) -1 ] * sin(theta/2 )

Simplify each part:

First term: 2 sin(theta/2) cos^2(theta/2)
Second term: [ -2 cos^2(theta/2) + 1 -1 ] * sin(theta/2) → -2 cos^2(theta/2) * sin(theta/2)

Adding them: 2 cos^2(theta/2) sin(theta/2) - 2 cos^2(theta/2) sin(theta/2) = 0.

So both equations are satisfied, so the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, I should check normalization. The eigenvector [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] has a norm squared of cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) = 1. So it's already normalized.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check each.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches the components we found. So that would be the eigenvector.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is exactly what we have. So the answer should be option C.

But let me think again. The problem states that the operator is P along n, which is in the x-z plane. So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but wait: wait, the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi (the azimuthal angle) is zero or pi, but in any case, in our parameterization for n, phi is zero. So our eigenvector is as we found.

So the normalized eigenvector components are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is a vector operator with components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, given as follows:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$

The operator along the direction $\vec{n}$ is given by $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis. Substituting this into $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$, we get:

\[
P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \sin\theta P_x + \cos\theta P_z
\]

Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, we find:

\[
P_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
P_n |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle
\]

Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, the eigenvalue becomes $1$. The matrix equation becomes:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix}
\]

This simplifies to the following system of equations:

1. $(\cos\theta - 1)v_1 + \sin\theta v_2 = 0$
2. $\sin\theta v_1 + (-\cos\theta - 1)v_2 = 0$

From the first equation, solving for $v_1$ in terms of $v_2$ gives:

\[
v_1 = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} v_2
\]

Using trigonometric identities, $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, this simplifies to:

\[
v_1 = \cot(\theta/2) v_2
\]

Choosing $v_2 = \sin(\theta/2)$ for normalization, we find $v_1 = \cos(\theta/2)$. Thus, the eigenvector is:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}
\]

This eigenvector is already normalized since $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$. Comparing this result with the options, it matches option C: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.
