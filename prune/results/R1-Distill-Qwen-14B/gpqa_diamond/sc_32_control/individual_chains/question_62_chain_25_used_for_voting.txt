Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. Let's read through the question carefully.

The goal is to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm. Let's break down the target molecule. It has a cyclohexane ring, and attached to it is a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and a carbaldehyde group. Wait, maybe I'm mixing that up. Let me clarify.

Wait, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde—so that's a cyclohexane ring with a formyl (CHO) group attached. And then, at the 1-position (which is adjacent to the aldehyde), there's a hydroxy methyl group which is also attached to a cyclohexyl group. So the structure would be cyclohexane ring with CHO, and at the adjacent position, a -CH(OH)-cyclohexane substituent.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynyl is a triple bond, so that's a cyclohexane ring with a terminal alkyne group (C≡CH). So the first step is to figure out how to convert this starting material into the target molecule.

Let me think about the possible reagents and reactions. I remember that alkynes can undergo various additions and functional group transformations.

Looking at the options, each has a sequence of reactions. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different reagents.

I think the process probably involves several steps: perhaps adding groups to the alkyne, then modifying those groups. Let me outline possible steps.

1. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH). 

So maybe the first step is to add a methyl group or another substituent to the alkyne. One common method for adding substituents to alkynes is using a metal like sodium amide (NaNH2), which is a strong base. But wait, NaNH2 is often used in deprotonation, especially in triple bonds. When alkynes are treated with NaNH2, they can form a strong base, such as in the presence of alkyl halides, leading to alkylation. So perhaps the first step is alkylation of the alkyne.

Wait, in option A, the first reagent is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So that's a possible alkylation. The alkyne would react with methyl chloride in presence of NaNH2. Wait, but wait: NaNH2 is a strong base, and methyl chloride is an alkylating agent. So in a typical alkyne alkylation, the alkyne is deprotonated by NaNH2, and then methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would act as the alkylating agent. So the product would be a gem-dimethyl group? Wait, no, wait: the alkyne is C≡CH. Deprotonation gives a lithium acetylide (or in this case, sodium?), which would react with methyl chloride to give a di-substituted alkyne, like CH2-C≡C-CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-C≡CH. So when you deprotonate it with NaNH2, you get the acetylide: cyclohexane-C≡C^- Na^+. Then adding methyl chloride would methylate it, giving cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. So the alkyne becomes dimethyl substituted? Or wait, no, because the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane-C≡CH. So after alkylation, it becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. So that's a propargyl group attached to the cyclohexane?

Wait, but the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to the hydroxymethyl. Hmm. Maybe the alkyne needs to be converted into an alcohol or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps we can hydrogenate the alkyne. Let's think about the steps. If the alkyne is hydrogenated, it would become a cis or trans double bond, depending on the catalyst. But the target is a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl group. So maybe after alkyne alkylation, we need to form a ring or add some functional groups.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group. Wait, another approach: maybe using a metal acetylide to form a cyclopropane ring via the Simmons-Smith reaction, but that's more for adding CH2 groups. Not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the sequence involves adding a substituent to the alkyne, then hydrogenating it to a single bond, then oxidizing or functionalizing.

Wait, let's think about the target structure again. It's a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a hydroxymethyl group that's attached to another cyclohexane. So maybe the hydroxymethyl comes from somewhere like a Grignard reaction, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into an enol ether or something else, but I'm not quite sure.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)- group. So maybe that cyclohexyl comes from a ring-opening or some kind of cyclopropanation.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone. Wait, no, because the aldehyde comes in the target.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to a double bond, then subjected to some dihydroxylation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation. Wait, the alkyne would oxidize to a diketone (if internal) or a carboxylic acid (if terminal). But our starting alkyne is terminal (C≡CH), so oxidation would lead to a carboxylic acid. But the target has an aldehyde group, not a carboxylic acid. So perhaps after oxidation, we can reduce it to form the aldehyde? But that seems a bit convoluted.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the steps in the options given.

Option A: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride. Then H2/Pd. Then Ba(OH)2. Then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, first step: alkyne becomes something else. Then H2/Pd—hydrogenation. So if the first step makes a gem-dimethyl alkyne (CH2-C≡C-CH3?), then hydrogenation would lead to a single bond. Wait, but hydrogenation of an alkyne would give cis or trans alkene, depending on catalyst. Oh wait, but Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes, but under certain conditions, it could be for complete hydrogenation to alkanes. Wait, Pd is generally for alkenes, but for alkynes, perhaps using H2 and Lindlar's catalyst gives cis alkenes. Alternatively, using a poisoned catalyst like Na/NH3 (liquid) would give trans.

Wait, so in option A, the second step is H2/Pd. So perhaps it's hydrogenating the alkyne to cis or trans alkene. But then, the third step is Ba(OH)2—could that be for Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? Not sure. Or maybe for some kind of epoxidation? Or perhaps for elimination.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used in the Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings. Wait, no, Birch is for arenes. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of alcohols, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, maybe the steps in option A are: alkyne methylated, then hydrogenated to cis-alkene, then Ba(OH)2 for some kind of dihydroxylation or epoxide opening. Then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O is a typical Jones oxidation condition, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, but in some cases, it can oxidize secondary alcohols to ketones.

Hmm, perhaps the intended pathway is a bit more straightforward.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a vinylic alcohol. Oh, but how? Maybe via hydration. So another possible approach is hydration of the alkyne to a ketone. Wait, no, that would require an internal alkyne. For a terminal alkyne, hydration would give a carbonyl group. So, for ethynylcyclohexane, which is a terminal alkyne, adding H2O would give cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Wait, that's exactly part of the target molecule: the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

Wait, but how to get the other substituent. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl, which is attached to the cyclohexane ring next to the aldehyde.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is first functionalized to introduce the cyclohexyl group. So let me think: after the alkyne is functionalized, perhaps it's hydrogenated, then something else happens.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group (like cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) using some reagent, but I'm not sure what reagent would do that. Alternatively, perhaps it's via oxidation. If we treat the alkyne with a strong oxidizing agent, like O3, but that usually cleaves triple bonds.

Wait, the other substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps the alkyne is converted to a cyclopropane ring, but that's not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a vinyl group, which can then undergo cyclopropanation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent. Wait, but that's not really applicable here.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me look at the options again and think about each step.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/liq. NH3; then O3/H2O; then NH4OH.

So first step: alkyne alkylation with ethyl chloride. So the terminal alkyne reacts with ethyl chloride in presence of NaNH2 to form cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then, second step is Li in liquid NH3—that's a strong base, used for deprotonating things. Wait, this could be for elimination or for forming a cyclopropane. Alternatively, in some reactions, like the formation of alkynes via deprotonation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the third step is O3 followed by H2O. That's ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if the second step somehow forms a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it.

But in this case, after alkylation, the molecule is a propargyl substituted cyclohexane. Then, reacting with Li and NH3 (liquid) could form a lithium acetylide again, but perhaps for a different purpose.

Wait, perhaps the second step is for deprotonation and elimination, forming a triple bond again? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe Li in NH3 is used for a different kind of reaction, like the formation of allenes. Hmm.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; then O3/(CH3)2S; then Ba(OH)2.

First step: alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3? Or perhaps methylated.

Second step: H2 with Pd-CaCO3. That's a catalyst for hydrogenation. So the alkyne would hydrogenate to cis or trans double bond. Depending on the catalyst, but Pd is usually for alkene hydrogenation, but for alkynes, sometimes Lindlar's is used. Wait, but in this case, the reagent is H2 and Pd, so perhaps it's hydrogenating the alkyne to a trans-alkene? Or maybe a single bond? Wait, no, H2 with Pd typically hydrogenates triple bonds to cis alkenes. Wait, no, wait: Lindlar's is for cis, while without a poison, like in H2 with Pd, perhaps the hydrogenation is less controlled and might go all the way to single bond. Wait, no, for alkynes, H2 with Pd would generally stop at the alkene. So the product would be cis or trans. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

But perhaps if the alkyne is first converted to a trans-alkene, then... what's next.

Third step is O3 with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive work-up. Ozonolysis followed by reductive work-up gives aldehydes or ketones, depending on the starting alkene. So if the alkene is symmetric, you get two carbonyl groups. For example, if the alkene was CH2-CH2, ozonolysis would give two formyl groups, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, if the alkene is something like cyclohexene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, but in our case, after alkyne hydrogenation, what do we have?

Wait, initial structure after first step is cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. Then hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would give cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's a single bond, so the molecule becomes cyclohexane with a three-carbon chain: CH2CH2CH3. No, wait, no, the alkyne is C≡C, so after hydrogenation, it becomes CH2-CH2, so the molecule is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be right. Wait, no: ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-C≡CH. After alkylation with methyl chloride, it becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. Then hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond. So the triple bond becomes a single bond, leading to cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no: the triple bond is between C1 and C2. So after hydrogenation, the triple bond becomes a single bond, but that would require adding two H2 molecules. Wait, maybe the triple bond converts to a single bond with two H2 molecules? Or perhaps the alkyne becomes a trans or cis alkene.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Another approach: perhaps the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is attached to the cyclohexane ring adjacent to the aldehyde. So maybe the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation, then something else is done. But how?

Wait, another thought: maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone via the hydroboration-oxidation method, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is subjected to a hydration reaction to form a carbonyl group. Oh wait, for a terminal alkyne, treatment with H2O and a catalyst (like HgSO4) would form a ketone? No, wait, no. Wait, the hydration of a terminal alkyne would give a carbonyl group. For example, HC≡C-R would become R-CO-CH3? Wait, no: the hydration of a terminal alkyne (like R-C≡CH) would form R-CO-H (a ketone if R is more substituted). Wait, no, actually, no: terminal alkynes upon hydration with acid (like H2SO4, HgSO4) give ketones. Wait, no, wait. For example, ethyne (acetylene) hydration gives ethyl ketone (acetone), which is (CH3)2CO. So in our case, ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH) would upon hydration form cyclohexane-C(O)-H, which is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Wait, wait, no. Wait, if the alkyne is R-C≡CH, then hydration would give R-C(O)-H, which is a ketone if R is more substituted, but if R is a cyclohexane ring, would that be a ketone or an aldehyde?

Wait, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. So if the alkyne is at the end, R is cyclohexane, so the product would be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Because the aldehyde has RCHO, where R is cyclohexyl. So that's the aldehyde group. So that's part of the target molecule. So if we can get the aldehyde from the alkyne via hydration, then perhaps that's the first step.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see any that have H2SO4 and HgSO4 as the first step, except option A, which has it as the fourth step. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the target again. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is attached to the cyclohexane ring next to the aldehyde. So, perhaps after forming the aldehyde, we need to add that cyclohexyl group.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the alkyne is first converted into an aldehyde, then subjected to some kind of cyclopropanation or addition to form the cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a Grignard reagent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is as follows:

1. Alkyne alkylation to add a substituent.
2. Hydrogenation to form a single bond.
3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.
4. Work-up to form aldehyde.

But I'm not exactly certain.

Let me think about option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; then Li/liq. NH3; then O3/(CH3)2S; then NH4OH.

Wait, the first step is NaNH2 and methanol. Methanol is an alkylating agent? Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. Methanol has a methyl group. So perhaps the alkyne is deprotonated, then methylated. But methylating a terminal alkyne with methanol would give cyclohexane-C≡C-OCH3? No, that's not likely. Wait, no, with NaNH2, the alkyne is deprotonated to form the acetylide, which can react with an alkyl halide. But methanol is not an alkyl halide. So perhaps this is a different kind of alkylation. Wait, maybe it's a quench with methanol, leading to the formation of an alkoxide. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, NaNH2 and methanol could be used for something else, like deprotonation followed by alkylation, but I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence involves adding a cyclohexyl group to the alkyne, then hydrogenating, then forming the aldehyde.

Wait, another approach is to think about each step in the options and see which makes sense.

Looking at option C: Steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: so alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenate the triple bond. If it's H2 with Pd, the triple bond becomes a cis or trans double bond? Or maybe fully hydrogenated to single bond? I think Pd with H2 typically hydrogenates triple bonds to cis alkenes. So the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no: after alkyne alkylation, it's C≡C-CH3. So when hydrogenated, it becomes CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to the cyclohexane. So the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's a three-carbon chain, which doesn't directly lead to the target.

Then step 3: O3/(CH3)2S. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds. But in this case, after hydrogenation, the structure is a single bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't cleave anything. Hmm, that seems off.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the hydrogenation step. Maybe the alkyne becomes a trans-alkene. Then ozonolysis would cleave it into two aldehyde groups. So, for example, if the structure after hydrogenation is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3, that's a single bond, but wait, that's a straight chain. Ozonolysis wouldn't act on single bonds. So perhaps I'm not on the right track.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation step isn't for the alkyne but for another part. Maybe the alkyne is converted into a different structure. Hmm.

Let me think about the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group at position 1. And at position 1 (adjacent to formyl), a hydroxymethyl group which is connected to another cyclohexane ring.

So perhaps the alkyne is converted into a cyclopropane ring, but I'm not sure how.

Wait, I'm getting a bit lost. Let me try to outline possible steps.

1. Start with ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH).

2. Alkyne is alkylated to add a substituent. For example, adding a methyl group via NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

3. Then, hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene. So cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3 as a single bond? Or perhaps a double bond between the two carbons.

Wait, but cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3 after hydrogenation would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a single bond. So that may not help.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation step is for a different purpose, like adding hydrogen to a triple bond to form a ketone via some mechanism. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is transformed into a carbonyl group via oxidation. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. But how?

Hydration of an alkyne with H2O, HgSO4, H2SO4 would do that. So if the first step is that, but looking at the options, option A has that as the fourth step.

But in the options, the first step is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So maybe the first step is alkylation, then something else.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is alkylated, then hydrogenated to a single bond, then oxidized to a carbonyl.

But I'm not exactly seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first alkylated, then hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then subjected to some dihydroxylation, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps another way: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl. So perhaps the alkyne is converted into a cyclohexane ring via some cyclopropanation or ring-opening.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent, which can then add a cyclohexane ring. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone via oxidation, then a cyclohexane ring is added via some conjugate addition.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to form a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis to cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

4. Work-up to form the aldehyde.

But I'm not exactly sure how that leads to the target.

Alternatively, thinking about the target, the position adjacent to the aldehyde has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. So perhaps that hydroxymethyl comes from a Grignard addition or a hydroxylation.

Wait, another approach: maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone via hydration, then a Grignard reagent is added to form the cyclohexyl group.

But the target's structure is a bit more complex.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is: alkylate the alkyne, hydrogenate to a single bond, then perform some oxidation and reduction to form the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Looking back at the options:

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li in liq NH3; O3, (CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Wait, NaNH2 with methanol. Methanol is a methylating agent, but NaNH2 would deprotonate the alkyne, then methanol could act as an electrophile. So the alkyne would get a methyl group, making it cyclohexane-C≡C-OCH3? No, because methanol is CH3OH, which might not directly methylate. Or perhaps the acetylide reacts with methanol, but I'm not sure of the product.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is forming the acetylide, which is then treated with methanol under basic conditions to form an ether. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the first step is deprotonation (NaNH2) to form the acetylide, then quenching with methanol would give cyclohexane-CH2-OCH3? No, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a deprotonation and methylation, but I'm not familiar with that specific reaction.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should think about the target molecule and how each step in the options might contribute to its formation.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

So, the aldehyde is at position 1, and the substituent is a hydroxymethyl connected to a cyclohexane.

Perhaps the hydroxymethyl comes from a Grignard reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group (the aldehyde), and then a cyclohexyl group is added via some coupling.

Wait, another possibility: the alkyne is converted into a cyclohexane ring via a ring-opening. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first alkylated to form a propargyl group, then hydrogenated to form a cyclohexane ring. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a diol via some dihydroxylation, then that diol is used to form a ring.

Wait, but the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)- group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then that ketone is subjected to a cyclohexane ring formation.

Wait, maybe the correct steps are:

1. Alkyne alkylation to add a substituent.

2. Hydrogenation to form a ketone.

3. Ozonolysis to cleave the structure.

4. Work-up to form the aldehyde.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol, which is then oxidized or reduced to form the necessary groups.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for the correct option by considering each step's outcome.

Looking at option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes CH≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-CaCO3 → hydrogenate triple bond to cis double bond (but I'm not certain about the product structure).

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis of double bond into carbonyl groups.

4. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps some kind of oxidation or elimination.

Hmm.

Wait, for the target molecule, the aldehyde is directly attached to the cyclohexane. So, if the ozonolysis step produces that aldehyde, perhaps that's the pathway.

Let me try to imagine the steps in option C.

Step 1: Alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3 (cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3).

Step 2: Hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond, so cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait, no. Wait, the triple bond is C≡C, so hydrogenation would add two H's to each carbon, making CH2-CH2, but that's a single bond. So product is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the triple bond converts to a trans double bond, perhaps.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let's correct: the starting material after step 1 is cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. Then, step 2: hydrogenation with H2 and Pd. This hydrogenation would typically reduce the triple bond to a double bond (cis or trans). So the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond? No, wait: it's R-C≡C-CH3 → R-CH2-CH2-CH3 upon hydrogenation with H2 and a catalyst. Or wait, no, with H2 and Pd, the triple bond would become a single bond, but that's adding two H2 molecules, so it's a complete hydrogenation.

Wait, but H2 and Pd is more commonly used for alkenes, but for alkynes, perhaps it's a partial hydrogenation. So, if the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls.

So, after step 2, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond (cis or trans) between the two middle carbons. Then, ozonolysis (step 3 in option C) would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, the molecule would split into two parts. But since the starting molecule is a cyclohexane attached to a longer chain, perhaps the ozonolysis would break the double bond and form two carbonyls on the same carbon.

Wait, maybe the chain is CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between the first and second carbons. Ozonolysis would cleave this into two aldehyde groups. But then, the cyclohexane would be attached to an aldehyde group. So the product after ozonolysis would be cyclohexane-CHO and another CHO group. But that doesn't seem to match the target.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the target again. It's a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and a cyclohexyl hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps the formyl comes from the alkyne via some oxidation, and the cyclohexyl comes from another reaction.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Alkyne alkylation to add a group.

2. Hydrogenation to form a single bond.

3. Oxidation to form an aldehyde and a cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is as follows:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group, making it a geminal di-substituted alkyne.

2. Hydrogenation to form a cyclopropane ring, which upon ring-opening forms the cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl.

But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another approach: think about each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li, liq NH3 → perhaps elimination to form an allene (cumulative diene) or something else.

3. O3, H2O → ozonolysis would cleave any double bonds formed into carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → work-up, perhaps hydrolyzing ozonides to aldehydes or ketones.

But I'm not sure how that would form the cyclohexyl group.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → alkyne becomes something with a methyl ether group.

2. Li, liq NH3 → maybe forming a strong base for elimination.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH → work-up.

Not sure.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes gem-dimethyl alkyne.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate to single bond.

3. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps oxidation or elimination.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → Jones oxidation.

Wait, so step 4 is Jones oxidation. If step 3 gives an alcohol, Jones would oxidize it. So perhaps the pathway is:

Alkyne → alkyne with methyl group → hydrogenated to single bond → some oxidation to form an alcohol → oxidized to ketone or aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, which would insert an oxygen next to a ketone. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: maybe the target molecule is formed via the following steps:

- Alkyne to aldehyde via hydration.

- Then, the aldehyde is converted into a Grignard reagent, which adds a cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not seeing that in the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C.

Let me think: in option C, steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes CH≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → triple bond becomes double bond (cis or trans).

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S → reductive work-up, so cleavage into aldehydes.

4. Ba(OH)2 → oxidation or elimination.

Wait, after step 3, the molecule would have two aldehyde groups. Then Ba(OH)2 step would perhaps form a ketone or an ester, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis in step 3 would cleave the double bond, giving two aldehyde groups. Then, Ba(OH)2 in step 4 might cause some elimination, forming a ring.

Wait, but the target has a cyclohexane ring attached via a hydroxymethyl group.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another angle: the target has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and a substituent that's a cyclohexyl hydroxymethyl.

Perhaps the substituent comes from a cyclopropane ring-opening. So the alkyne is first converted into a cyclopropane, which upon ring-opening forms the hydroxymethyl.

Wait, but how would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is derived from a Grignard reaction. So, the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then a Grignard reagent adds a cyclohexane group.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Wait, considering the target's structure, the formyl group and the hydroxymethyl group are adjacent. So perhaps they are formed from a single carbonyl group that's been split into two.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is first converted into a diketone via ozonolysis, then each ketone is reduced to form the adjacent groups.

But I'm not sure.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to think of each option's possible outcome and see which could form the target.

Option C:

Step 1: Alkylation → CH≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond? Or single bond.

Wait, no, H2 and Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, so the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. That's an alkane, not an alkene.

Then step 3: ozonolysis. But ozonolysis requires a double bond, so if step 2 gives a single bond, then step 3 wouldn't do anything. So that can't be right.

So option C is probably not correct.

Option B:

Step 1: Alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li in liq NH3 → strong base. Maybe elimination to form an allene, or perhaps deprotonation to form a stronger base.

Step 3: O3/H2O → cleaves double bonds into carbonyls.

Step 4: NH4OH → work-up.

But not seeing the connection to the target.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Could this be a quench after deprotonation? Maybe forming an ethereal oxygen.

Step 2: Li in liq NH3 → strong base, perhaps elimination.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S → cleavage.

Step 4: NH4OH → work-up.

Again, not sure.

Option A:

Step 1: Alkyne becomes CH≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → single bond, CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2 → perhaps oxidation or elimination. Could Ba(OH)2 cause a ring formation?

Step 4: Jones oxidation → oxidize an alcohol to a ketone or acid.

Hmm, perhaps step 3 forms an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Ba(OH)2 is used for the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or esters. If the molecule has an alcohol group, Ba(OH)2 might oxidize it. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used in the Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings.

I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should consider that the correct option is B.

Wait, let me consider the steps again. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl, which is attached to the cyclohexane next to the aldehyde.

So perhaps the hydroxymethyl comes from a Grignard addition to a carbonyl group.

So the steps could be:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → Alkyne alkylation → CH≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Hydrogenate to get CH2-CH2-CH2CH3.

Wait, but that leads to a longer chain, not the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, then a Grignard adds a cyclohexane.

Wait, another possibility: the alkyne is first converted into a ketone via hydration (using HgSO4, H2SO4, H2O), then a Grignard reagent adds a cyclohexane group, forming a secondary alcohol which is then oxidized to the aldehyde.

But looking at the options, the fourth step in option A is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which is the hydration conditions. So perhaps option A is the correct one.

Let me retrace:

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes CH≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond, so CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2 → maybe oxidize the alcohol to a ketone? Wait, but where is the alcohol coming from.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is for forming an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → Jones oxidation conditions. So if step 3 forms an alcohol, step 4 would oxidize it.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne alkylation to CH≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenate to CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2 → some kind of oxidation to form a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, but I'm not seeing the connection.

Alternatively, the steps in option A are:

1. Alkylation → CH≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate to CH2-CH2-CH3, which is an alkane.

3. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps epoxidation? Or some kind of elimination.

But I'm not sure.

Hmm. I'm not getting anywhere. Perhaps I should make an educated guess.

Wait, the correct option likely involves first alkylating the alkyne, then hydrogenating it to form a single bond, then oxidizing to form the aldehyde, and perhaps another step to form the cyclohexyl group.

Wait, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another angle: the target's structure suggests that the cyclohexyl group is attached via a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps the hydroxymethyl comes from a Grignard addition to a carbonyl.

So perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone, then a Grignard adds, forming a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

So the steps would be:

1. Alkyne → ketone via hydration (using H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O).

2. Grignard addition → add cyclohexyl group, forming an alcohol.

3. Oxidize the alcohol to aldehyde.

Looking at the options, option A's steps are:

1. Alkylation.

2. H2/Pd.

3. Ba(OH)2.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, step 4 in option A is the hydration step. So maybe steps are:

1. Alkyne alkylation.

2. Hydrogenation.

3. Some oxidation.

4. Hydration to aldehyde.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is option C.

After struggling, I think I'll have to go with option C: the steps are alkylation, hydrogenation to a double bond, ozonolysis to form carbonyls, and Ba(OH)2 for oxidation.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps option B is correct.

Alternatively, I'll make a guess based on the steps that form the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, the correct sequence likely involves:

1. Alkyne alkylation to add a substituent.

2. Hydrogenate to a ketone.

Wait, but no, hydrogenation of alkyne doesn't directly form a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted to a carbonyl group (aldehyde), then a Grignard adds a cyclohexane.

But how.

Hmm. I think the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane ring. The analysis of the options focuses on determining the correct sequence of reagents to achieve this transformation.

### Key Analysis of Options:

1. **Option A**:
   - **Step 1**: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride alkylate the terminal alkyne, forming a gem-dimethyl alkyne (cyclohexane-C≡C-CH₃).
   - **Step 2**: H₂/Pd hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, resulting in a cyclohexane-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃ structure.
   - **Step 3**: Ba(OH)₂ could oxidize or eliminate, but the exact transformation is unclear.
   - **Step 4**: H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O (Jones oxidation) could oxidize an alcohol or aldehyde. However, the sequence does not clearly explain how the cyclohexyl group is introduced or how the hydroxymethyl group is formed.

2. **Option B**:
   - **Step 1**: NaNH₂ and ethyl chloride alkylate the alkyne, forming cyclohexane-C≡C-CH₂CH₃.
   - **Step 2**: Li in liquid NH₃ could deprotonate or eliminate, possibly forming an allene.
   - **Step 3**: O₃/H₂O cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.
   - **Step 4**: NH₄OH works up the ozonolysis products. However, this sequence does not clearly lead to the formation of the cyclohexyl group or the hydroxymethyl group.

3. **Option C**:
   - **Step 1**: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride alkylate the alkyne, forming cyclohexane-C≡C-CH₃.
   - **Step 2**: H₂/Pd hydrogenates the alkyne to a cis-alkene, resulting in cyclohexane-CH=CH-CH₃.
   - **Step 3**: O₃/(CH₃)₂S cleaves the double bond into two carbonyl groups, forming aldehydes.
   - **Step 4**: Ba(OH)₂ could oxidize or functionalize the aldehyde. This sequence partially aligns with the target structure but does not fully explain the introduction of the cyclohexyl group.

4. **Option D**:
   - **Step 1**: NaNH₂ and methanol could form an ether or modify the alkyne, but the product is unclear.
   - **Step 2**: Li in liquid NH₃ could deprotonate or eliminate, but the exact transformation is ambiguous.
   - **Step 3**: O₃/(CH₃)₂S cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.
   - **Step 4**: NH₄OH works up the ozonolysis products. This sequence does not clearly lead to the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
Option C provides the most plausible sequence for forming the target molecule. The alkylation and hydrogenation steps set up the structure for ozonolysis, which could produce intermediates that align with the target's aldehyde and hydroxymethyl group. While the exact introduction of the cyclohexyl group remains unclear, Option C is the most consistent with the transformations described.
