Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

Alright, the problem says we have 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy change when they're all mixed together.

Wait, enthalpy of neutralization usually involves an acid reacting with a base. The general reaction is acid + base → salt + water, and the enthalpy change is measured per mole of acid or base reacting, depending on the context.

But wait, wait. Let me think. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait—it's diprotic. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base as well. So, when these are mixed, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base.

I think the first step is to figure out the moles of H+ from each acid and the moles of OH- from the base.

Let's start with HCl. HCl is a monoprotic acid, so each mole gives one mole of H+. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = M * V. So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. So 0.1 moles of H+ from HCl.

Next, H2SO4. It's a diprotic acid, meaning each mole gives two H+ ions. The solution is 300 mL, which is 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. So moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base, Ba(OH)2. It's a strong base and each mole gives two OH- ions. The volume is 200 mL, so 0.2 L. Molarity is 0.5 M. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the limiting reagent is whichever runs out first. Let's see: acid provides 0.28 moles H+, base provides 0.2 moles OH-. So OH- is the limiting reactant; all 0.2 moles will react. That leaves 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles of H+ unreacted.

Wait, no, wait again. When mixing, the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4. So total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So the neutralization will use up all the OH-, and there's leftover H+.

So the total amount of H+ that reacts is 0.2 moles, and the same with OH- since they're 1:1. So the moles of water formed from neutralization is 0.2 moles.

Wait, but wait another thought. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so when it dissociates, it gives Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles OH^-. So the moles of OH^- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2, which matches what I had before.

So the acid side: HCl is 0.1 moles H+, H2SO4 is 0.18 moles H+, total 0.28. The base contributes 0.2 moles OH^-.

So the reaction will neutralize 0.2 moles of H+ with 0.2 moles of OH^-, producing 0.2 moles of water. The remaining H+ is 0.08 moles, but I don't think that affects the enthalpy of neutralization for the reaction that occurred.

Now, the enthalpy of neutralization is usually considered as the heat released when an acid donates H+ and a base donates OH- to form water. The standard value is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-), since the enthalpy of formation for water is about -57 kJ per mole. But wait, I think the exact value is around -57.3 kJ per mole of H2O formed, which comes from 1 mole H+ and 1 mole OH-.

Wait, let me think. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is typically given as -57.3 kJ per mole for strong acids and strong bases. But since all the acids and bases here are strong (HCl is strong, H2SO4 is strong, Ba(OH)2 is strong), the enthalpy change will be based on the moles of H+ and OH- that react.

In this case, 0.2 moles of H+ react with 0.2 moles of OH- to form 0.2 moles of water. So the enthalpy change would be 0.2 moles * (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ.

Wait, but the options given are in kcal and some in kJ. Let me check the options again. Option B is -11.42 kcal, option D is -16.0 kJ. Oh wait, because 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So I need to make sure what units the answer expects.

Wait, but the options have different units. Let me see: option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about 11.5 kJ (since 2.72 *4.184≈11.4). Option B is -11.42 kcal, which would be about 47.8 kJ. Option D is -16.0 kJ. So I'm not sure.

Wait, my calculation was 0.2 * 57.3 = 11.46 kJ. But since it's exothermic, it's negative, so -11.46 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. That's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's go back.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 moles H+.

Total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → each gives 2 OH-: 0.2 moles OH-.

So the H+ available is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. Thus, the neutralization is 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacting.

So the reaction produces 0.2 moles of water, releasing 0.2 * 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ. But since it's exothermic, the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ.

Wait, but option B is -11.42 kJ? No, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So none of the options match -11.46 kJ exactly. Hmm, but perhaps the question expects using a different enthalpy value, like per mole of H+ or per mole of H2O.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is often given as about -57.3 kJ per mole of H2O formed. So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ. So that's about -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. That doesn't match. Option B is in kcal. Let's check if the question asks for kcal or kJ.

The problem says "Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization...", and gives options in kcal and kJ. So perhaps the question expects the answer in kJ but I got -11.46 kJ, which is close to option D but option D is -16.0 kJ. So maybe I made a mistake in the moles.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct stoichiometry. Wait, maybe I forgot that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but the second dissociation may not be 100% for the second H+? No, wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid, so the first H+ dissociates completely, the second is also strong but perhaps not as much? Wait no, H2SO4 is considered a strong acid for the first dissociation (H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-), but the second H+ may not be as strong. Actually, no, I think the first dissociation is complete, but the second is not, but wait, in reality, the first H+ is completely dissociated, and the second is a weak acid. Wait, but I'm not sure. Hmm, this complicates things.

Wait, no. For H2SO4, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, correction: H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, no, wait. No, sulfuric acid is a strong acid for the first dissociation: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, no, wait. Actually, the first dissociation is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- only when it's in a solution that's very concentrated, like when it's a liquid. In aqueous solution, the first H+ dissociates completely, but the second H+ is a weak acid and doesn't dissociate completely. Wait, no, actually, in aqueous solution, H2SO4 is a strong acid, but the second H+ isn't as strong. So when you have H2SO4 solution, it dissociates into 2H+ and SO4^2- only in concentrated solutions. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think.

Wait, no, I think in dilute aqueous solutions, H2SO4 dissociates completely into 2H+ and SO4^2- because it's a strong acid. Or is that only the first H+? Hmm, perhaps I should double-check this. Wait, for the purposes of this problem, the H2SO4 is given as 0.3 M. So in that case, does it dissociate completely into 2 H+ each mole? Or just 1 H+?

Wait, the problem says H2SO4 is 0.3 M. So as an acid, each mole would produce 2 moles of H+ because it's a diprotic strong acid. But wait, no, the first H+ is strong, the second is weak. So in a solution of H2SO4, the first H+ comes off completely, but the second may not. But in the context of such problems, they often assume that all H+ are available. So perhaps for this problem, each mole of H2SO4 contributes 2 moles of H+.

Alternatively, maybe the problem treats H2SO4 as a diprotic acid, releasing 2 H+ per mole. So when I calculated 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles, times 2 is 0.18 moles H+.

Hmm, perhaps that's correct.

So going back, the total H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. So net H+ after reaction is 0.08, but the neutralization uses up 0.2 moles H+ and OH-.

So the heat released is 0.2 * 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ. So that's approximately 11.46 kJ, exothermic, so -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger. Option B is in kcal. Let me see option B: -11.42 kcal. Wait, but 11.46 kJ is about 2.7 kJ, which is about 0.647 kcal (since 1 kJ ≈ 0.239 kcal). Wait, no, wait, 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So 11.46 kJ is about 2.74 kcal (11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.74). Hmm, but I calculated 11.46 kJ. So none of the options match exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering Ba(OH)2 as contributing two OH- per mole, but perhaps each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces one mole of OH-? No, no, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives two moles of OH^-. So that part was correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering all the H+ and OH- neutralizing, but I might have miscalculated the moles.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles:

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L. 0.2 M * 0.5 = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L. 0.3 M * 0.3 = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL =0.2 L. 0.5 M * 0.2 = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH^-.

So H+ available: 0.28, OH^- available: 0.2. So the neutralization is 0.2 moles.

The enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D, which is -16.0 kJ, but that doesn't match. Option B is in kcal, which is about  -11.42 kcal. Wait, wait, 11.46 kJ is approximately 2.74 kcal (because 11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.74). So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close to that. Hmm, but that's only considering 0.2 moles. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry somewhere.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the total solution is considering dilution and using the heat capacity to calculate the temperature change, but that would require more information like specific heat, which isn't provided here. So I think the approach I took is correct, using the moles of H+ and OH- reacting.

So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.5 kJ. Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.4 kJ, so that's way off. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is also off.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the moles.

Wait, let me double-check:

HCl: 500 mL * 0.2 M = 500 * 0.2 = 100 mmol? Wait, 500 mL is 0.5 L, so 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Correct.

H2SO4: 300 mL * 0.3 M = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 H+, so 0.18. Correct.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL * 0.5 M = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles, each gives 2 OH^-, so 0.2. Correct.

So the neutralization is 0.2 moles → 11.46 kJ.

Hmm. Let's see the options again. Option D is -16.0 kJ. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't considering all the H+ from H2SO4. Let me think: if H2SO4 is a diprotic acid but only the first H+ dissociates completely, and the second is weak. So in that case, each mole of H2SO4 would give only 1 mole of H+.

Wait, I think in aqueous solution, the first H+ of H2SO4 is fully dissociated, but the second is a weak acid and doesn't fully dissociate. So for a 0.3 M H2SO4 solution, the H+ would be approximately 0.6 M, but wait, that's if the second H+ doesn't dissociate. Wait, no, for dilute solutions, the first H+ is strong, the second is weak.

Wait, but when it's 0.3 M H2SO4, the first H+ is completely dissociated, so the initial H+ is 0.6 M. The second H+ from HSO4^- is a weak acid. So the total H+ would be approximately 0.6 plus a small amount from HSO4^-.

But for the purposes of this problem, perhaps they consider both H+ ions as available. Alternatively, maybe the problem treats H2SO4 as a diprotic acid, releasing 2 H+ per mole.

In any case, I think the initial approach is correct, leading to 0.2 moles reacting and an enthalpy change of -11.46 kJ.

But since none of the options match exactly, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: the problem is mixing all the solutions, so the total volume is 500 + 300 + 200 = 1000 mL. But I don't think the volume affects the moles, so that's not an issue.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy per mole of H+ is -57 kcal/mol? No, because 57.3 kJ is about 13.66 kcal (since 57.3 /4.184 ≈13.66). So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * (-13.66) = -2.73 kcal, which is close to option A (-2.72 kcal). But that would be if the enthalpy per H+ is -57 kcal/mol, which seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using -57 kcal per mole of H2O, which is about -13.66 kcal per mole of H+.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think again.

The standard enthalpy of neutralization is typically given as -57.3 kJ per mole of H2O formed. So each mole of H+ and OH- reacting gives -57.3 kJ.

So 0.2 moles → 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ. So the answer should be approximately -11.46 kJ, which is about -11.5 kJ. Looking at the options, the closest is option D, which is -16.0 kJ. No, that's not close. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the H+ from HCl and not from H2SO4. Let me try that scenario.

If HCl contributes 0.1 moles H+ and H2SO4 is not considered because it's a weak acid (only 1 H+ dissociates), then the total H+ would be 0.1 + 0.09 = 0.19 moles. OH- is 0.2.

So in that case, OH- is in excess. The H+ available is 0.19, so 0.19 moles of H+ and OH- react, producing 0.19 moles of H2O. The enthalpy change would be 0.19 * (-57.3) ≈ -10.89 kJ, which is about -10.89 kJ. Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the moles of the limiting reagent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the enthalpy is calculated based on the concentration and volume, but I'm not seeing how that would change the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the total moles of H+ and OH- and considering the excess H+ as contributing to the solution's pH but not the neutralization enthalpy. So the neutralization is only for the amount that reacts.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't considering the dilution but that doesn't affect the moles, so that's not an issue.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. For example, sometimes it's given as -57.0 kJ/mol H2O, so 0.2 * 57=11.4 kJ, which would match option B if it were in kJ. But option B is in kcal.

Wait, so 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

But looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Let me compute what -11.42 kcal is in kJ.

1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. So 11.42 kcal *4.184 ≈ 47.76 kJ. So that's about 47.76 kJ, which doesn't match.

Wait, but wait, no. If the problem expects the answer in kcal, then -11.46 kJ is approximately -2.73 kcal (11.46 /4.184 ≈2.736). That would match option A (-2.72 kcal). But then, why would the problem use kcal instead of kJ when the standard unit is kJ? Because usually, in such calculations, the answer is in kJ.

Hmm, maybe the question is a bit ambiguous, but looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 47.8 kJ, which doesn't fit. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is a bit larger than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles.

Wait, Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles OH-. Correct.

HCl: 0.2 *0.5=0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.3*0.3=0.09, times 2 is 0.18. Correct.

Total H+: 0.28. OH-: 0.2.

So 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the enthalpy per mole of HCl and H2SO4 neutralized, but that seems more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but when mixed with a base, the SO4^2- could react with Ba^2+ from the base to form BaSO4, which is a precipitate. But that reaction would involve sulfate and Ba^2+ ions. Would that affect the enthalpy of neutralization?

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a base, so when it dissociates, it gives Ba^2+ and OH^-.

H2SO4 dissociates into 2 H+ and SO4^2-.

So when you mix them, Ba^2+ and SO4^2- could form BaSO4, which is a precipitate. The reaction would be Ba^2+ + SO4^2- → BaSO4(s). The formation of BaSO4 could release heat, which would affect the total enthalpy.

Oh! I think this is the key point I missed. So the total enthalpy change would be the sum of the neutralization enthalpy and the enthalpy change from the precipitation of BaSO4.

Wait, but this complicates things. Let me think. How much BaSO4 is formed?

Each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 1 mole of Ba^2+ ions. Each mole of H2SO4 provides 1 mole of SO4^2- ions. So the moles of Ba^2+ is 0.1, and moles of SO4^2- is 0.09 (from H2SO4) plus any from HCl? Wait, HCl provides Cl^- ions, so no. So SO4^2- is 0.09.

So the reaction between Ba^2+ and SO4^2- would be 0.09 moles, as that's the limiting reagent (since Ba^2+ is 0.1, SO4^2- is 0.09). So 0.09 moles of BaSO4 would precipitate.

Now, each mole of BaSO4 formation has a certain enthalpy change. I'm not sure about the exact value, but perhaps it's exothermic. Let me look this up mentally. The enthalpy of formation of BaSO4 is about -1268 kJ/mol (I think), but that's the enthalpy when forming from elements. Alternatively, the enthalpy of precipitation for BaSO4 is around -20 kJ per mole, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps in solution, the reaction of Ba^2+ and SO4^2- to form BaSO4 is exothermic, so it would release heat, contributing to the total enthalpy change.

Wait, but without the exact value, this complicates the problem. The original question didn't mention anything about precipitates, so perhaps this is beyond the scope of the question. Alternatively, the problem expects us to ignore this and only consider the neutralization reaction.

Hmm, so perhaps the problem expects the answer to be -11.46 kJ, but none of the options match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization of all the OH- by the available H+.

Wait, the OH- is 0.2 moles. The available H+ is 0.28, so 0.2 moles of H+ will neutralize 0.2 moles of OH-.

So the enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

But looking at the options, no option matches exactly. The closest is option D (-16.0 kJ) but that's not close. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the option in kcal.

Wait, 11.46 kJ is approximately 2.74 kcal, which is close to option A (-2.72 kcal). But earlier I thought the standard value is -57.3 kJ per mole, which is correct.

Wait, but the question asks for the enthalpy of neutralization when all three solutions are mixed. So perhaps it's considering all the H+ and OH- reacting, but I think that's what I did.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the dilution effect and using the heat capacity equation q = m * c * ΔT. But without knowing the heat capacities or any temperature changes, this approach isn't feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the sum of all the H+ and OH- and see if any excess is present.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and total OH-.

Total H+ = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- =0.2 moles.

So, excess H+ is 0.08 moles.

But the neutralization only uses the 0.2 moles.

So the heat released is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

So in that case, the answer is approximately -11.46 kJ, which is not listed as an option. The options are:

A) -2.72 kcal → ~11.5 kJ

Wait, no: 1 kcal is ~4.184 kJ. So 2.72 kcal is 2.72 *4.184 ≈11.45 kJ. Oh wait! So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is approximately -11.45 kJ. That matches.

Wait, because 2.72 *4.184 ≈ 11.45. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about -11.45 kJ.

So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but why is the answer in kcal? Because the problem gives options in both units. So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But earlier I thought the enthalpy was -11.46 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal (since 11.46 /4.184 ≈2.736).

So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close.

Wait, but let me check the calculation:

2.72 kcal = 2.72 *4184 J ≈ 11450 J → 11.45 kJ.

Yes, exactly matching 0.2 *57.3 kJ=11.46 kJ.

So the answer is option A.

Wait, but why would the enthalpy be calculated in kcal when the standard is kJ? It's possible the question expects the answer in kcal. So the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Determine moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - **HCl (monoprotic):**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).
   - **H₂SO₄ (diprotic):**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).
   - **Total moles of H⁺ from acids:**  
     \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Determine moles of OH⁻ from base:**
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).

3. **Neutralization reaction:**
   - The reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \), which is exothermic with a standard enthalpy change of \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) per mole of water formed.
   - The limiting reagent is OH⁻, as it has fewer moles (\( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \)) compared to H⁺ (\( 0.28 \, \text{moles} \)).
   - Therefore, \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \) of H⁺ and OH⁻ react to form \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \) of H₂O.

4. **Calculate enthalpy change:**
   - Enthalpy change = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \times (-57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \).

5. **Convert to kcal (if necessary):**
   - \( 1 \, \text{kcal} = 4.184 \, \text{kJ} \), so \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

6. **Match with options:**
   - Option A (\( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \)) matches the calculated value when converted to kcal.
   - Other options are either in the wrong unit or do not match the calculated value.

**Final Answer:**  
The enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A
