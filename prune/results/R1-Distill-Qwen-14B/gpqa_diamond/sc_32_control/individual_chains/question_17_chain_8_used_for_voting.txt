Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where there's a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, wait. I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, right? Like, in a 1:1 ratio for many cases. So the Ca-EDTA complex would be something like CaY²- where Y is the EDTA^4- ion. 

The formation constant, Kf, is given as 5x10^10. I think the formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−, and Kf is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, initially, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. I'm assuming that the initial concentrations of free Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are zero because all the EDTA is tied up in the complex. But wait, that can't be right because the problem asks for the concentration of Ca²+ ions. So maybe there's some dissociation going on.

Wait, the complex isn't 100% stable, so a tiny amount dissociates. So, the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- as per the equation. So, let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Then, the EDTA^4- concentration would also be x because the reaction is a 1:1 ratio. But wait, the complex itself is 0.02 M, so after dissociation, the concentration of the complex would be approximately 0.02 - x. But since x is going to be really small compared to 0.02, maybe we can approximate it as 0.02.

So, the Kf expression would be Kf = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Plugging in the numbers: 5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) → 5e10 = 0.02 / x² → x² = 0.02 / 5e10 → x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, no, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 2e-6.5 is 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7 M. Hmm, that's option C: 6.3e-7 M. 

Wait, but wait a second. Let's do the math more accurately. So 0.02 divided by 5e10 is 0.02 / 5e10 = (2e-2) / (5e10) ) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7 M. So yes, about 6.3e-7 M, which matches option C. 

But wait, another thought: sometimes, in such problems, the initial assumption is that the complex is fully dissociated into the ions, but that's not the case here because Kf is very large, so the complex is mostly intact. So the free Ca²+ concentration is very low, which is why the calculation gave a small x. So option C seems correct.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The equilibrium expression for \( K_f \) is:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, we assume that the dissociation is minimal, so the concentration of the complex remains approximately 0.02 M. Let the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions be \( x \). Since the dissociation is 1:1, the concentration of \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) ions will also be \( x \). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
