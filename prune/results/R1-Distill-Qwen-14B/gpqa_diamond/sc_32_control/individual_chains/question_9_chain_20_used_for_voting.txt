Okay, so I've got this question about molecular symmetry, specifically asking which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry groups, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that C3h symmetry means the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) combined with a mirror plane (σh) that includes that axis. Alternatively, C3h can also be thought of as having a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also be symmetric across a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out each molecule's structure to see which one fits this symmetry.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. I think it's a borate with three isopropyl groups attached. The structure of triisopropyl borate is like B(OCH(CH2CH3)2)3. So the boron is at the center, and each O is connected to an isopropyl group. Each isopropyl is a symmetrical group, so the molecule should have some symmetry. Let me visualize: each of the three substituents is the same, so maybe a trigonal planar arrangement around boron. That would give a C3 axis, right? Because you can rotate 120 degrees and the molecule looks the same. But does it have a mirror plane that includes that axis? Well, since each substituent is symmetric, perhaps. So it might have C3h symmetry. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's C3v because of the mirror planes.

Wait, another approach: triisopropyl borate is known for its structure. I think it's a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents. So the symmetry would be D3h, which includes C3h. But wait, no, D3h has more symmetry elements. Or maybe it's just C3v? Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Option D is quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound with a seven-membered ring. Its structure is like a bridge between two rings. I think it's a polycyclic with a bridge, so the symmetry might be lower. Let me think about its structure. Quinuclidine has a bridge that makes it have a sort of chair-like structure, but I don't think it has a C3 axis. It's more like a C2 symmetry maybe? Because when you rotate it 180 degrees, it looks the same. So probably not C3h.

Option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me parse the name. It's a trifuran system, which I think is three fused furan rings. The substituents are triphenylene groups. So maybe triphenylene is attached in certain positions. Hmm, I'm not familiar with the exact structure, but the name suggests that there are three phenylene groups attached as substituents on the trifuran. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, maybe in a trigonal fashion, then it could have C3 symmetry. But wait, triphenylene itself is a symmetric molecule, but how does it attach here? Maybe the substitution pattern leads to a higher symmetry.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Again, a trifuran system with benzo substituents. The benzo groups would be attached in specific positions. I'm not sure about the symmetry here. Trifuran is a fused ring system, and if the substituents are arranged in a way that allows rotation and reflection, maybe C3h. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: I remember that quinuclidine has a bridgehead structure, and its symmetry is actually C2 because of the bridge. So option D is probably C2, so not C3h.

Triisopropyl borate (option C) is a trigonal planar molecule, so it has a C3 axis. Now, the presence of a horizontal mirror plane (σh) would mean that the molecule is also symmetric across that plane. So if each isopropyl group is arranged symmetrically, then yes, a C3h symmetry. But wait, is the molecule planar? Triisopropyl borate has a planar trigonal structure, so the mirror plane would be the one that passes through the boron atom and is perpendicular to the plane. So I think this molecule does have C3h symmetry because it can be rotated 120 degrees and mirrored across a plane and look the same.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because some sources say that triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry, which includes C3h. But I think D3h is higher symmetry than C3h. Or maybe C3h is a subgroup. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a C3 axis but doesn't have a mirror plane, so it's C3, not C3h. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: C3h symmetry implies that the molecule has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule must look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also mirror across a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. So for triisopropyl borate, each isopropyl is the same and arranged symmetrically. The mirror plane would be through the boron and between two isopropyl groups. So, yes, the molecule should have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the borate doesn't have a mirror plane. Wait, each isopropyl group is a symmetrical substituent. So the molecule should have a plane of symmetry that bisects the boron and each pair of isopropyl substituents.

Wait, but for example, in a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents, the symmetry is D3h. Because it has multiple symmetry elements: the C3 axis, three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 (each through a substituent and the boron), and the horizontal mirror planes. So D3h is higher than C3h. But the question is which has C3h, which is a subgroup. So perhaps none of the molecules here have just C3h symmetry, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe triphenyleno... option A. Let me think about it. If the molecule is a trifuran with three phenyl groups attached at positions that are symmetrically arranged in a trigonally symmetric way, then it would have a C3 axis. And if there's a mirror plane, it would have C3h.

But I'm not sure about the exact substitution pattern. The name indicates that there are three substituents from different parts. The substituents are at positions 1,2-c; 5,6-c'; and 9,10-c''. So perhaps the substituents are arranged in a trigonal fashion on the central ring, leading to C3 symmetry. Then, if there's a mirror plane perpendicular to the C3 axis, it would have C3h.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that when you rotate 120 degrees, the molecule looks the same, and also a mirror plane exists, so C3h.

But I'm not certain which molecule among the options has that. Let me go back to the options.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran... So, I think the substituents are attached in a way that each is in a different position, but maybe arranged symmetrically. If the substituents are in positions that are 120 degrees apart, then C3. Plus a mirror plane, so C3h.

Option B: benzo substituents. Maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that doesn't allow a three-fold rotation. If the substituents are in adjacent positions, the symmetry would be lower.

Wait, another way: Quinuclidine (D) has a bridge, so it's more like a C2 symmetry. So option D is probably out.

So between A, B, and C.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. If its symmetry is D3h, then it has more than C3h. But the question is which has C3h. So perhaps option C isn't the right answer because it's higher symmetry.

So perhaps the correct answer is option B or A.

Alternatively, I think quinuclidine is actually a molecule with a three-fold symmetry, but I'm not sure. Wait, no. Quinuclidine has a bridge structure, which I think gives it C2 symmetry. So option D is out.

So now, looking again at option A and B.

Option B: benzo substituents. The structure is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran. So perhaps the substituents are on the trifuran in a symmetric pattern. Maybe in such a way that when rotated 120 degrees, the substituents align. But wait, benzo groups are attached in a certain way. If the substituents are arranged in a trigonally symmetric way, then it could have C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps option A has three larger substituents, triphenylene groups, which are attached symmetrically.

Wait, triphenylene is a tricyclic aromatic compound itself. So if the substituents are arranged symmetrically on the trifuran, then perhaps the molecule has C3h symmetry.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the actual structures.

Triisopropyl borate: trigonal planar, three identical substituents, so probably D3h symmetry, which includes C3h, but the highest symmetry is D3h.

Option A is a more complex molecule. If it's a trifuran with three triphenylene substituents arranged symmetrically, then perhaps it's D3h as well.

Wait, but the question is which has C3h symmetry. So perhaps none of the options have exactly C3h, but that can't be since it's a multiple-choice.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, triisopropyl borate, which has C3h symmetry.

Wait, another memory trigger: C3h is the symmetry of ammonia (but ammonia has C3v). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps C3h is present in some molecules with a three-fold axis and a mirror plane.

Wait, another thought: the molecule with C3h symmetry must have a plane of symmetry. So in triisopropyl borate, the mirror plane would pass through the boron and bisect each substituent pair. So yes, it should have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged such that rotation by 120 degrees brings the molecule back to itself, and a mirror plane exists, then it has C3h or D3h.

Wait, but D3h includes C3h. So if the molecule has D3h symmetry, then it certainly has C3h symmetry as a subset. So triisopropyl borate would have D3h, which includes C3h. So if the question is which has C3h, then this molecule does have it, but perhaps the question is only asking for the minimal symmetry, but I think the question is just asking which has C3h as a symmetry element, regardless of whether it has more.

So I think option C, triisopropyl borate, does have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is triisopropyl borate, so that would be the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A or B.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between C3h and D3h. So if the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) plus a C3 axis, but also other symmetry elements, then it's D3h. But the presence of C3h symmetry doesn't exclude other elements; it just requires those two.

So in any case, the molecule in option C has C3h symmetry, so the answer is option C.

To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the options based on their structures and symmetry elements. **C₃h** symmetry requires a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that includes the rotation axis. 

### Option A: **triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
This molecule is a trifuran system with three triphenylene substituents. The substituents are likely arranged symmetrically, potentially in a trigonal fashion. If the substituents are positioned 120° apart and the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane, it could exhibit **C₃h** symmetry. However, the exact structure is complex, and the presence of additional symmetry elements (e.g., C₂ axes) could elevate the symmetry beyond **C₃h**.

### Option B: **benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
This molecule is also a trifuran system but with benzo substituents. The substituents are attached in a specific pattern, but their arrangement may not allow for a three-fold rotation axis or a horizontal mirror plane. This suggests that the molecule is less likely to have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option C: **triisopropyl borate**
Triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule with three identical isopropyl groups attached to a central boron atom. The molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that includes the boron atom. This combination confirms that the molecule has **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option D: **quinuclidine**
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound with a bridge-like structure. Its symmetry is likely limited to **C₂** due to the bridge, as it does not exhibit a three-fold rotation axis or a horizontal mirror plane. Therefore, it does not have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion
Among the options, **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) is the only molecule that clearly exhibits **C₃h** symmetry. It has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, fulfilling the requirements for **C₃h** symmetry.

**Answer: C**
