Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The system has 10,000 identical particles, each moving in a tube along the x-axis. When they measured the positions, none were found outside x=1 and x=3, so the particles must be confined between x=1 and x=3.

The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that seems a bit odd. Usually, wave functions are complex, so having an imaginary part makes sense. But the real part here is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. Or is it (a divided by sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i? Oh right, the way it's written, the wave function is a/(sqrt(1 +x)) minus 0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1 +x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. 

Wait, but for a quantum state, the wave function must satisfy a normalization condition. The total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. So the integral of the probability density over all space should equal 1. Since the wave function is given, I can compute the normalization condition.

But wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that seems a bit strange because in standard quantum mechanics, the wave function usually has real and imaginary parts that are functions of x, not constants. But in this case, the real part is a function of x, and the imaginary part is a constant (-0.5i). So, the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) + (-0.5) i.

Wait, but if that's the case, the probability density is the modulus squared of the wave function. So |ψ(x)|² = [ a/(sqrt(1+x)) ]² + [ (-0.5) ]². Because when you have a complex number, the modulus squared is (Re)^2 + (Im)^2. So that would be (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

But wait, wait, the wave function is ψ(x) = real part plus i times the imaginary part. So in this case, ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) + (-0.5) i. So the modulus squared is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. That's because (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2.

But wait, is the imaginary part a constant? Because if the imaginary part is a constant (-0.5), then the integral for normalization will become a bit tricky because the real part is a function of x. Let me think about the normalization condition. The integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx must be equal to 1.

So the integral becomes ∫ [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx from x=1 to x=3. Because (0.5)^2 is 0.25.

But wait, how can the integral of a function that's a sum of (a^2)/(1+x) and 0.25 be equal to 1. Let's compute this integral.

Compute the integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3: that's a² ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3. So a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

The integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Solving for a²: a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Wait, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931. So 0.5 / 0.6931 is about 0.7213. So a² ≈ 0.7213, so a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849. Looking at the options, option B is 0.85 and option A is 1.1. So the closest is option B, 0.85.

But wait, let me double-check the integral setup. The wave function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

So the integral should be ∫[a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx from 1 to 3.

Wait, but integrating, the integral of a²/(1+x) is a² ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to 3: a² (ln4 - ln2) = a² ln(2). The integral of 0.25 is 0.25*(3-1)=0.5.

So total integral: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2). Then a = sqrt(0.5/ln(2)).

Calculating 0.5/ln(2): 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85, so option B.

Wait, but what's the reasoning with the wave function? Because usually the wave function must satisfy certain physical conditions, like being square-integrable and finite. Here, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), which approaches zero as x approaches infinity. But our particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. Hmm, but the wave function here is given as valid only in that region, right? So the wave function is zero elsewhere, but in the region between 1 and 3, it's non-zero. So the normalization integral is just over that interval.

But another thing to check is whether the wave function is correctly normalized. Because if the wave function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, then the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25. So the integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5. Set that equal to 1.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the modulus squared. Because when you have a complex number, ψ = A + iB, the modulus squared is A² + B². So yes, that's correct. So the setup is correct.

So, the correct value of 'a' is approximately 0.85, which is option B.

To determine the value of \( a \) in the wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), we use the normalization condition for quantum wave functions. The total probability of finding the particle must equal 1, so the integral of the probability density \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over the interval \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \) must equal 1.

The wave function is given as \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), where the real part is \( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} \) and the imaginary part is \( -0.5 \). The probability density is the modulus squared of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) \, dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two separate integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} 1 \, dx = 1.
\]

1. For the first term, \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx \), the antiderivative of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating this from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
\]

Thus, the first term becomes \( a^2 \ln(2) \).

2. For the second term, \( 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} 1 \, dx \), the integral of \( 1 \) over \( x \) from 1 to 3 is \( 3 - 1 = 2 \). Therefore, the second term is:

\[
0.25 \cdot 2 = 0.5.
\]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \), we find:

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

The closest value to \( 0.849 \) among the given options is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
