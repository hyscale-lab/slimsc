Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions and NMR spectra. Let me try to take it step by step.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of like a cage structure. So 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on two of the bridgehead carbons that are three positions apart? Wait, no, 1 and 3 in adamantane might be adjacent. Hmm, maybe I should visualize the structure. Adamantane has a structure that's a series of fused cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms on adjacent bridgeheads, I think. Because in the chair-like structure, 1 and 3 positions would be next to each other.

So when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C, what happens? Oh, that's probably an elimination reaction. KOH is a strong base, and when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) are treated with a base, they undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. So each Br would leave, and the adjacent carbons would form a double bond. So two eliminations would happen here. Wait, but wait, the starting material has two bromines on adjacent carbons. So when you eliminate twice, you form an allene? Or maybe a conjugated diene? Or wait, perhaps it's a vicinal dihalide, so elimination would give either a triple bond or an alkene. Wait, but with two adjacent dihalides, perhaps each adjacent pair eliminates H and Br to form a double bond. So double elimination would give a diene?

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines separated by some carbons. If each Br is on a bridgehead, perhaps each elimination would lead to a double bond, but since they're on adjacent bridgeheads, maybe a ring double bond? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but the product is a light yellow solid, which makes me think it's an alkene. The IR spectrum has a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, but elimination reactions usually form alkenes, not ketones. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the reactions. Oh, wait, another possibility: if the base is strong enough, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation that forms a carbonyl? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's a double elimination forming an alkyne? But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the product is an alkene, right? Because elimination of HBr forms a double bond. But why is there a carbonyl in the IR? Unless I'm misunderstanding the initial step. Oh wait, maybe it's not elimination. Another possibility: when vicinal dihalides react with a strong base like KOH, sometimes they can undergo a substitution reaction, like aSN2, but that would require a better leaving group. Wait, but with two bromines on adjacent carbons, maybe they undergo a coupling reaction. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, let's think about the NMR spectrum of product 1. The 1H NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is probably a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, maybe an ether or ester. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, so perhaps product 1 is an epoxide? Or maybe a diol? Wait, no, because elimination would form an alkene, not a diol. Alternatively, maybe a ring-opening occurred, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, which is a strong base, it might eliminate two equivalents of HBr, forming an alkene. But wait, if the two Br atoms are on bridgehead carbons, eliminating each HBr would form a double bond between those bridgeheads. But in adamantane, bridgeheads are bridgehead carbons, and forming a double bond there would change the structure. So perhaps the product is a dehydroadaman-tane, which has a double bond in the structure. But then, why would the IR show a carbonyl?

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking wrong. Maybe the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. Could it be a ring-opening? For example, if the dihalide undergoes a ring-opening with KOH, forming a diol? But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the product is an epoxide. But how? Epoxides come from the reaction of alkenes with peracids, not from dihalides. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an enol ether. But I'm not sure how that would form. Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination to form a conjugated diene. Then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. Wait, but substitution on a bridgehead carbon is unlikely because of the structure's stability. So perhaps elimination is more plausible. Let me think again: the product's 1H NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a singlet, perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. Oh! Maybe it's an epoxide. Wait, but how? Because epoxide formation requires an alkene and a peracid.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction forms an alkene, and then another reaction occurs? Or perhaps I'm missing the correct reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone. How? Let me think. If the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to a bromine, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. Wait, but that would require elimination of Br and H to form a double bond, but that's the same as elimination. So that produces an alkene, not a ketone.

Hmm, perhaps the initial product is a diol. Wait, but KOH is a base. So maybe it's a ring-opening of the adamantane dihalide, forming a diol through a substitution mechanism. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation forming a carbonyl group because of the position. Wait, maybe in this case, the base abstracts a proton that's adjacent to the bromine, leading to the formation of a carbonyl. Oh, wait, that's the possibility. If you have two adjacent Br atoms, and the base abstracts a β-hydrogen from each, leading to elimination of two HBr molecules and forming a carbonyl group. Because, wait, for example, when vicinal dihalides are treated with a strong base, they can form a ketone. Oh! That's called the Corey-Fuchs reaction or something else? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. So, if each Br is on adjacent carbons, and the base abstracts a hydrogen, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, but that would require each Br to be on a carbon adjacent, so that eliminating each would form a carbonyl. So, perhaps each Br is on a CH2 group, and eliminating HBr from each would form a C=O group? Wait, but the two Brs are on adjacent carbons. So, if each Br is on a CH2, then eliminating from each would lead to a ketone. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane—assuming the two Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads—so maybe each bridgehead is a CHBr group. Then, elimination would form a bridgehead C=O group. But wait, bridgehead carbons can't have double bonds because of the Bredt's rule. Oh, right! Bredt's rule says that bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed in bicyclic structures unless the ring is large enough. So, perhaps elimination can't form a bridgehead double bond, so perhaps the reaction forms a ketone.

Wait, but if the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to a Br, causing the formation of a carbonyl. So for each Br, maybe each Br is on a CH2 group. Then, eliminating HBr from each CH2Br would form a C=O group. So, the product would be a diketone? Or perhaps one ketone. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps only one of the Br atoms is eliminated, but that doesn't fit with the IR showing a strong carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, forming an exocyclic double bond, but that would require a different structure.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with a base, perhaps a ring-opening occurs, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is a gem-diol, but that would require substitution, which is unlikely for bridgehead positions.

Wait, let me think about the IR again. The peak at 1720 cm-1 is indicative of a carbonyl group, probably a ketone. So product 1 must have a ketone group. So how does 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH form a ketone?

Oh! Wait, I think I got it. The reaction is a vicinal dihalide elimination to form a ketone. If the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, and each is on a secondary carbon, then elimination of two HBr molecules would form a ketone. Wait, but that's not possible with vicinal dihalides. Wait, perhaps each Br is on a CH2 group. So, when KOH is added, each Br leaves, and the adjacent CH2 groups combine to form a carbonyl. So, the two CH2Br groups become CO. So, each elimination releases HBr, and the two adjacent CH2Br groups lose two HBr and form a ketone.

Wait, maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation. For example, in a vicinal dihalide, elimination can form a carbonyl group. So, from CH2Br-CH2Br, elimination would lead to O=C=O, but that's not possible because that would require losing two HBr from each adjacent carbon. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is like forming an epoxide, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a vicinal dihalide elimination forming an alkene, but then I'm not sure why the IR has a carbonyl peak. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone because each Br is on a bridgehead, and eliminating each Br with KOH forms a bridgehead ketone, but Bredt's rule says that bridgehead double bonds are not allowed, but bridgehead ketones are allowed because the carbonyl is sp² but not a double bond. So wait, can a bridgehead have a carbonyl group? Let me think about that. I believe that bridgehead carbonyls are possible under some conditions, but I'm not entirely certain. Maybe in this case, that's what's happening.

So, product 1 would be 1,3-adamantanedione or something similar, which would have two ketone groups. But wait, the NMR doesn't show any peaks that would suggest two ketone carbonyls. Oh, wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, but the NMR only has one singlet at 4.79 ppm, which is two protons. So maybe it's a single ketone group.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclopropane or another structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. Let me think. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane eliminates HBr to form an epoxide. But how? Because epoxides are formed from alkenes reacting with peracids. Unless the base-induced elimination forms an alkene, which then reacts with something else. But in this case, the conditions are KOH, so perhaps it's just elimination.

Alternatively, maybe the initial product is a diol. Let me think: KOH as a base could lead to substitution, but bridgehead substitution is unlikely. So perhaps the product is a diol, but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl in IR.

Wait, maybe it's a neighboring group elimination. Wait, perhaps the two Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads, and when heated with KOH, each Br is eliminated as HBr, and the two bridgeheads form a double bond. But bridgehead double bonds are not allowed, so instead, a carbonyl forms.

Wait, but if the bridgeheads can't form a double bond, maybe they form a ketone. So each bridgehead CHBr becomes a carbonyl group. But that would require each bridgehead to become a carbonyl, which would make a diketone.

Wait, but the NMR of product 1 has a signal at 4.79 ppm, which is around where an oxygenated CH2 group would appear. So perhaps it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclic ether. Like an epoxide. But to form an epoxide, you need an alkene and a peracid. So unless the KOH is acting differently, I don't see how that would happen.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone and an epoxide, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction forms a diene, which upon further treatment with KOH could form a diol, but that doesn't fit with the IR's carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck on the first step. Let me try to move forward and see if that helps.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But since the first product is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an acylium ion or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol. Then, treating with Al(i-Pr)3 (aluminum isopropoxide) could lead to a pinacol rearrangement, which forms a ketone. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alkene, and the aluminum isopropoxide is used in some kind of addition reaction. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the second reaction is heating with Al isopropoxide. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or some kind of enolate. Alternatively, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that would require aromatic rings, which I don't think are present here.

Wait, perhaps the first product 1 is an alcohol. If product 1 is a diol, then treating with Al isopropoxide could cause dehydration, forming an alkene. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first product is a gem-dimethyl ketone or something similar. Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere.

Let me try another approach: looking at the third step. Ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide (DMS), which usually is a work-up step in ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, breaking the molecule into fragments. The reagents used (like DMS) determine how the fragments are handled. DMS is a reductive work-up, so it would break the ozonides into aldehydes and ketones, not carboxylic acids.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

Now, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR.

But to figure that out, I need to know the structure of product 3, which depends on the earlier steps.

Wait, but let me try to piece it all together.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (maybe a ketone or ether)
Step 2: product 1 + Al(i-Pr)3 → product 2 (maybe an enol ether or something else)
Step 3: product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3

But perhaps I should focus on what each step does.

Step 1: The heating of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Another possibility is that it undergoes a ring-opening via a substitution reaction. Since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, maybe the dihalide can react to form a diol. But substitution on bridgehead carbons is not typical. Alternatively, perhaps the base induces elimination, forming an alkene.

Wait, another thought: if the two Br atoms are on adjacent bridgeheads, perhaps elimination would form a bridgehead double bond, but since that's not allowed, perhaps it forms a carbonyl group instead. So each Br is on a CH2 group, and eliminating HBr from each would form a C=O. So product 1 would be a diketone.

But then the IR would show two strong carbonyl peaks, but perhaps it's a single peak if the two carbonyls are equivalent. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ether (epoxide). But how? Because that would require an alkene, which would come from elimination, but then the epoxide would form from ozonolysis, which is in the third step. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and when treated with Al(i-Pr)3, it undergoes a pinacol rearrangement to form a ketone. Pinacol rearrangement involves dehydration of a 1,2-diol (geminal diol) to form a carbonyl compound. So if product 1 is a 1,2-diol, then product 2 would be a ketone. But is that applicable here?

Wait, product 1's NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which could be a diol's -OCH2- group. But if it's a diol, perhaps it's a vicinal diol, like HO-CH2-CH2-O-. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again. If the first step forms an alkene via elimination, the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. So maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, the first step forms a ketone, which would explain the IR.

Wait, perhaps the initial compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon heating with KOH, it undergoes a double elimination to form 1,3-adamantanedione. So two ketone groups.

But then the NMR of product 1 would show the ketone carbonyls as singlets, but the NMR data doesn't show any singlet in that region. The NMR peaks are 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 is a singlet, so perhaps it's a CH2 group adjacent to something deshielding, like an oxygen.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diol. So the structure would have two hydroxyl groups. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Wait, another angle: the product 1 has an NMR peak at 4.79 (2H), which is a singlet. Possible structures for this could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like an ether or ester. Maybe it's an epoxide, but in that case, the CH2 group would be part of the epoxide ring, and the NMR would show different shifts.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone with an adjacent CH2 group. For example, (CH2)2CO. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a secondary alcohol. If KOH is used in a substitution reaction, perhaps it's a SN2, but substitution on a bridgehead is unlikely. So probably not.

Wait, another possibility: the initial reaction forms an alkyne. Because two eliminations could form a triple bond. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the IR again. The 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 has a carbonyl group. So maybe the product is a ketone.

So, after heating with KOH, 1,3-dibromoadamantane becomes a ketone. How?

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a CH2 group, and elimination of both HBr leads to the formation of a ketone. For example, if the structure is CH2Br-CBrH-CH2, eliminating two HBr would give CH2=CH-CO. But that's not possible because that would require a bridgehead double bond, which is not allowed.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a bridgehead ketone, which is allowed. So the product would be a ketone at the bridgehead.

So, product 1 is 1,3-diketoadamantane? No, perhaps it's a single ketone. Wait, but the IR shows a single strong peak, so maybe it's a single ketone group.

Wait, perhaps the two Brs are on adjacent bridgehead carbons, and elimination leads to a single ketone. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination forming a conjugated diene, which is then oxidized somehow. But that doesn't fit with KOH.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for other clues, like the NMR of product 1.

So product 1's NMR is 4.79 (2H, singlet), 2.41-2.23 (10H, probably CH2 or CH groups), and 1.94 (2H, probably another CH2 group).

The singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H) suggests a CH2 group where the two protons are equivalent and adjacent to an electronegative group, like oxygen. So, maybe it's an OCH2O group (like in an ether), but that would require more splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl group. So, for example, something like (CH2)CO.

Wait, if product 1 is a diketone, perhaps the structure is such that there are two ketone groups. But then the NMR wouldn't have a singlet at 4.79 ppm. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a gem-dimethyl ketone. For example, (CH3)2CO. But in that case, the CH3 groups would be split into a singlet. But the NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H, which suggests a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an ester, like an adamantyl acetate. If that's the case, the ester group would have a CH3CO-O- group, which would show a triplet around 4 ppm. But the singlet at 4.79 ppm doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ether, like an epoxide. The epoxide ring would have two adjacent CH2 groups, but I'm not sure about the NMR shifts.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an enol ether. Enol ethers have a structure like CH2=CH-O-CH2-CH2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the singlet is from a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, in a structure like CH2-CO. So, the 4.79 ppm is a CH2 next to a carbonyl, and the 2.41-2.23 is the bridgehead CH groups, and the 1.94 is another CH2.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Moving on, product 1 is then heated with Al(i-Pr)3 to form product 2. Al(i-Pr)3 is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts reactions. But without an aromatic ring, perhaps it's used for acylation or alkylation elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps it's involved in an elimination reaction.

Wait, another possibility: AlCl3 is used in the formation of acylium ions from carboxylic acids, but again, not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, Al(i-Pr)3 could facilitate the formation of an acylium ion from a ketone, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and Al(i-Pr)3 dehydrates it into an alkene. So, if product 1 is a vicinal diol, then product 2 would be an alkene. Then, ozonolysis would break that into two carbonyl groups.

But let's see. If product 1 is a diol, the NMR would have peaks for the OH groups, but the data doesn't show that. The 4.79 ppm could be the diol's CH2 group.

Wait, but the IR doesn't show an OH stretch, so maybe the diol is not present. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is something else. Maybe product 2 is an enol ether. Enol ethers are formed by the reaction of ketones with bases, but I'm not sure about the role of Al(i-Pr)3 here.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an acetal or ketal. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Assuming product 2 is an alkene, the ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl compounds. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would likely be part of a carbonyl group or adjacent to it.

But perhaps product 3 is a diketone or has two aldehyde groups. Then, the H's adjacent to the carbonyls would be deshielded and appear upfield or downfield depending on the structure.

Wait, but the most deshielded hydrogen is typically the one closest to the electronegative group, like a carbonyl.

In the case of ozonolysis of an alkene, each end of the double bond becomes a carbonyl group. If the alkene is symmetrical, the product would be two identical carbonyl compounds. If it's asymmetrical, they would be different.

The coupling pattern depends on the neighboring protons. For example, if a carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group, the H's on CH2 would couple with each other and possibly with adjacent groups.

Wait, but the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen, which is probably the one closest to the carbonyl. So, in a carbonyl group, the adjacent CH2 group's protons would be deshielded and might be split based on their neighboring protons.

If the carbonyl is connected to a CH2 group which is next to another CH2, the protons on the first CH2 would be split into a triplet due to coupling with the two protons on the adjacent CH2.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to a CH group, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis produces aldehyde groups. The aldehyde protons are typically around 9-10 ppm, which are very deshielded. But in the NMR of product 3, we're asked about the most deshielded hydrogen. Aldehyde protons are usually the most deshielded, but in this case, the question says to exclude those that exchange with the deuterated solvent. So perhaps the aldehyde protons are exchangeable and are excluded, meaning we're looking for the next most deshielded.

Wait, but if the ozonolysis produces ketones, then the adjacent protons would be the most deshielded. Let's say the structure after ozonolysis is two ketone groups connected to CH2 groups. For example, if the alkene was in a CH2-CH2 arrangement, then ozonolysis would give two aldehyde groups, but that's assuming a terminal alkene. Alternatively, if the alkene was internal, ozonolysis would produce two ketones.

Wait, but I'm not getting closer. Let me try to outline possible structures.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone with a CH2 group adjacent, like (CH2)2CO. Then, treating with Al(i-Pr)3 could lead to a rearrangement, perhaps forming an enol ether or another structure. Then, ozonolysis of an alkene would produce carbonyls.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an alkene, and product 3 is the ozonolysis products.

Wait, but let's think about the ozonolysis step. Ozone cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. The number of neighboring protons will determine the splitting in the NMR.

If the most deshielded hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl group and has two neighboring protons, it would be a triplet due to coupling with those two.

Alternatively, if it's adjacent to a group with more protons, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, but the options given are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

If the proton is adjacent to a CH2 group, which has two protons, then the splitting would be a triplet.

But if it's adjacent to a CH group which is next to another CH2, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, for example, if a CH2 is next to a CH which is next to another CH2, the coupling would involve multiple neighbors. Let's consider a scenario where the most deshielded proton is on a CH2 that's next to a CH2 group (two protons) and a CH group (two protons from the CH2 and perhaps one from the CH). So the splitting could be a quartet, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, if the proton is on a CH2 group next to a CH2 group with two protons, it would be a triplet.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: the options are about the coupling pattern. The most deshielded H (excluding exchangeables) is probably near a carbonyl.

If the structure is such that this H is on a CH2 group next to another CH2, then it would be a triplet.

But perhaps the structure is more complex.

Wait, in ozonolysis, the breaking of the double bond can create two carbonyl groups. Suppose the alkene was between two CH2 groups. Then, ozonolysis would cleave to form two aldehydes. But if the alkene was between a CH2 and a CH, then one side would be a ketone and the other an aldehyde.

Wait, but without knowing the structure of product 2, it's hard to predict.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a cyclopropane. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the first step gives a product with a singlet of 2H at 4.79 ppm. That suggests a symmetrical CH2 group attached to something deshielding.

If product 1 is a ketone with a CH2 group next to it, like (CH2)2CO, then treating with Al(i-Pr)3 could induce a rearrangement, perhaps forming an enol ether, which would have a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So product 2 would be an enol ether with a double bond.

Then, ozonolysis of the enol ether would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. The resulting product 3 would have carbonyl groups, and perhaps the adjacent CH2 groups.

So, the structure after ozonolysis would be two aldehyde groups if the double bond was at the end, or ketones if it's internal.

Wait, but the enol ether would have a structure like CH2-O-CH2, but that's not correct. Enol ethers are more like CH2=CH-O-R, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene. Then, ozonolysis would cleave each double bond.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to think about the NMR of product 3.

Product 3's NMR is what we're interested in. The most deshielded H (not exchanging) would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group. The coupling pattern depends on adjacent Hs.

If this H is on a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2, then it would be a triplet due to coupling with two Hs.

Alternatively, if it's adjacent to a CH group, which is next to a CH2, the splitting could be more complex, like a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets.

Wait, considering the options, the answer is likely a triplet, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is coupled with two sets of neighboring Hs. For example, if it's on a CH2 that's next to a CH2 (2 Hs) and another adjacent CH2 (another 2 Hs), the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, but that's option B.

Wait, no, the proximity and the splitting depends on the coupling constants. If a proton is coupled to two equivalent protons, it would be a triplet. If it's coupled to two different sets of protons, each with a different J value, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to two other CH2 groups, leading to more splitting.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another thought: in the initial product 1, the 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H, which suggests no neighboring Hs. If product 2 has a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. The Hs adjacent to the carbonyls would then be next to CH2 groups.

Wait, for example, if the ozonolysis produces two ketones, each adjacent to a CH2 group. Then, the Hs on the CH2 would be split by their neighboring Hs.

If each CH2 is next to another CH2 group with two Hs, the Hs would be a triplet.

So, the most deshielded H would be part of a CH2 group next to another CH2, giving a triplet.

So, the answer would be triplet, option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning leading to the answer:

---

### Step 1: Reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH
1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH at 240°C. KOH, being a strong base, likely induces a double elimination reaction. The two vicinal bromine atoms are eliminated as HBr, forming a carbonyl group. This is consistent with the IR spectrum showing a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The product, referred to as **product 1**, is likely a ketone.

The **¹H NMR spectrum** of product 1 provides further clues:
- A singlet at **4.79 ppm (2H)** suggests a symmetrical CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative group (likely oxygen, as in a ketone).
- Peaks at **2.41-2.23 ppm (10H)** and **1.94 ppm (2H)** correspond to CH and CH₂ groups in the adamantane framework.

Thus, product 1 is likely a ketone with a CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl.

### Step 2: Reaction of product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide
Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(i-Pr)₃) is a strong Lewis acid, commonly used in reactions like Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. However, since product 1 is a ketone, it is likely involved in a rearrangement or further reaction. A plausible outcome is the formation of an enol ether or a related structure (**product 2**), which sets up the molecule for subsequent ozonolysis.

### Step 3: Ozonolysis of product 2
Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl compounds. If product 2 contains a double bond, ozonolysis at -78°C followed by reductive work-up with dimethyl sulfide (DMS) would break the double bond into two carbonyl-containing fragments (**product 3**). The exact structure of product 3 depends on the nature of product 2, but it likely contains aldehyde or ketone groups.

### Analysis of the ¹H NMR spectrum of product 3
The question asks for the coupling pattern of the **most deshielded hydrogen atom** in product 3, excluding exchangeable protons. The most deshielded hydrogen is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. The coupling pattern depends on the number and arrangement of neighboring protons:
- If the hydrogen is on a CH₂ group adjacent to another CH₂ group, it would couple with two protons, resulting in a **triplet**.
- More complex splitting (e.g., triplet of triplets or doublet of triplets) would occur if the hydrogen is coupled to multiple sets of protons with different coupling constants.

Given the reaction sequence and the expected structure of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen is likely part of a CH₂ group adjacent to another CH₂ group, leading to a **triplet** coupling pattern.

### Final Answer
The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is a **triplet**.
