Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let's see, the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. Hmm, wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions. The formula for the complex might be something like CaY²-, where Y is the EDTA part. So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-. The K given here must be the formation constant, Kf, for this complex. Oh wait, but the problem says K is KCa-EDTA. I think that's the same as Kf, the formation constant.

The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So initially, I think the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. The question is asking for the concentration of Ca²+ in the solution.

Wait, but the complex is the main species here. So the initial assumption is that the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Now, when it dissociates, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- will be equal because the stoichiometry is 1:1. But wait, because K is so large, the complex is very stable, so it won't dissociate much. So the concentrations of the individual ions should be small.

Let me set up an ICE table. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates from the complex. So the initial concentrations are: [CaY²-] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are 0. As it dissociates, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaY²-] = 0.02 - x. But since K is 5e10, which is a huge number, x will be very small compared to 0.02. So 0.02 - x is approximately 0.02.

So the expression for K is [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaY²-] = K. Plugging in the numbers, x * x / 0.02 = 5e10.

That gives x² = 5e10 * 0.02. Let's compute that: 5e10 * 0.02 is 1e9. So x² = 1e9. Taking the square root, x is 3.16e4? Wait, that can't be right because 3e4 is way bigger than 0.02 M. That would mean x is 0.0316 M, which is more than the initial concentration. That can't happen because the complex can't dissociate more than it's present.

Hmm, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Oh wait, perhaps I should consider the total concentration of EDTA. But wait, the solution is only the Ca-EDTA complex, so the EDTA is entirely in the complex form except for the small x amount. So the initial assumption holds.

Wait, but if K is 5e10, which is a very large K, the denominator [CaY²-] is about 0.02 M, so the (x^2) / 0.02 is 5e10. So x^2 = 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9. So x is sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4 M? That's impossible because it's way higher than the initial concentration. So something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I inverted the K expression. Let me think. The formation constant Kf is for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-; Kf = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

Wait, in that case, the expression would be [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])) = Kf. So rearranged, [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] = [CaEDTA²-]/Kf.

Ah, that's different. So in this case, setting [CaEDTA²-] as 0.02 M, so [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] = 0.02 / (5e10) = 4e-12.

But wait, in solution, the sum [Ca²+] + [CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 M. Since K is so large, [CaEDTA²-] is almost 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] is negligible. But the problem is, we can't ignore [Ca²+], because the product [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] is part of the equation.

Wait, but the EDTA comes only from the dissociation of the complex. Because the solution is only Ca-EDTA complex, so the EDTA in solution is the same as [EDTA^4-], which is x. So [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So substituting into Kf expression: (0.02) / (x^2) ) = 5e10. So x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 4e-13. So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7? Wait, 4e-13 squared is 2e-6.5? Hmm, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is 2 * 10^(-6.5) = 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we start by considering the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant is given as \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \), which is equivalent to the formation constant \( K_f \). The total concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and we assume that the dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K_f \), meaning the concentration of the complex remains approximately 0.02 M.

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) ions that dissociate from the complex. Since the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, the concentration of \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \) ions will also be \( x \), and the concentration of the complex will decrease by \( x \), but \( x \) is negligible compared to 0.02 M. Thus, the equilibrium concentrations are:

\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x, \quad [\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The equilibrium expression for \( K_f \) is:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}.
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions in the solution is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \).
