Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says: We mix 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy change, and the options are given in kcal and kJ. Wait, the units are mixed—some options are in kcal and others in kJ. Oh wait, looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, while others are in kcal. Hmm, but I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually given in kJ/mol, so maybe the answer expects that. But I'll proceed step by step.

First, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids reacting with bases to form water and possibly a salt. The general reaction is acid + base → salt + water. Enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when one mole of acid reacts with one mole of base.

But wait, the problem is mixing three solutions. So I need to figure out the moles of H+ and OH- ions each solution contributes, and then determine which ions are in excess. Because enthalpy of neutralization depends on the moles of H+ and OH- that actually react.

Let me break it down. Each acid will contribute H+ ions, and the base will contribute OH- ions. I'll calculate moles for each.

First, HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.

HCl: volume is 500 mL = 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

Next, H2SO4. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid and it's diprotic, so each mole gives 2 H+ ions. So for 300 mL (0.3 L) of 0.3 M H2SO4:

Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

Now, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH^-.

Ba(OH)2: volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH^- → 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles OH^-.

So total H+ from acids: 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28 moles H+.

Total OH- from base: 0.2 moles.

Now, the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The enthalpy change per mole of H+ reacting is the enthalpy of neutralization. But wait, since H+ and OH- are in different amounts, I need to find which is the limiting reactant.

H+ available: 0.28 mol.

OH- available: 0.2 mol.

The OH- is the limiting reactant here because 0.2 < 0.28. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and there will be 0.08 moles of H+ left unreacted.

The neutralization will produce 0.2 moles of water, releasing heat. The enthalpy change (ΔH) for each mole of H+ is typically around -57 kJ/mol (for strong acids and bases), but wait, I might have the exact value wrong. Wait, I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-) reacting, assuming strong acid and strong base. But wait, wait. Because H2SO4 is a strong acid but only the first H+ is strong, and the second is weaker. Or is H2SO4 fully dissociated in two H+? Hmm, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, in reality, the first dissociation of H2SO4 is complete (HSO4^-), but the second (HSO4^- → SO4^2- + H+) isn't as strong. But for the purpose of this problem, since it's a strong acid, maybe both H+ ions are considered to be fully released. Hmm, but when calculating neutralization, I think the H+ from H2SO4 is fully available. So I'll proceed with 0.18 moles of H+ from H2SO4.

So all right, so the neutralization will involve 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH- reacting. The total H+ from acids is more, but only 0.2 moles OH- are available to react.

Wait, but each H2SO4 gives 2 H+, but in the reaction, each H+ requires one OH-. So with 0.2 moles OH-, they can react with 0.2 moles H+.

The total H+ available is 0.28, so only 0.2 will react, leaving 0.08 moles of H+.

But wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is usually given per mole of reaction, which is per mole of H+. So since 0.2 moles of H+ react, and each releases about -57 kJ, the total ΔH would be 0.2 * (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ. Hmm, but wait, the options don't have this. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, so option B is about -11.42 kcal. Let me convert my calculation to kcal to check.

Wait, 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So -11.4 kJ is about -11.4 / 4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. Hmm, but that would give me -2.72 kcal, which is option A. But wait, I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. If each mole of H+ gives off 57 kJ (exothermic), so 1 mole → -57 kJ. So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. Which is what I thought.

But the options have D as -16.0 kJ and B as -11.42 kcal. Wait, but 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72). So option B is -11.42 kcal ≈ -11.4 kJ, which is what I calculated. So which is right?

Wait, the problem asks for the enthalpy of neutralization. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is typically given per mole of H+ (or OH-). So if 0.2 moles of H+ react, the total ΔH is 0.2 * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

But the options have B as -11.42 kcal and D as -16.0 kJ. So maybe the exact value of enthalpy is needed, perhaps using a more precise value.

Wait, I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is approximately −57.1 kJ/mol. So 0.2 mol × (−57.1 kJ/mol) = −11.42 kJ. So that would be -11.42 kJ, but none of the options have that. Wait, looking again, option B is -11.42 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ.

Hmm, perhaps I did something wrong in the calculation. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait, HCl: 0.5 L × 0.2 M = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L × 0.3 M = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L × 0.5 M = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 × 1 Ba(OH)2 → 2 OH- per mole, so 0.2 × 2 = 0.4 moles OH-? Wait, no! Wait, Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^- per formula unit. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH^-.

So 0.1 mole Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH^-.

Wait, okay, that's correct.

So total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

OH- is 0.2.

So the reaction can consume 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH- to make 0.2 moles H2O.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 × (−57.1 kJ/mol) = −11.42 kJ.

Wait, but in the options, B is in kcal, D is in kJ.

So the correct answer would be about −11.42 kJ, which isn't an option. The closest is option D: -16.0 kJ. But that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that H2SO4 is diprotic but only the first H+ is strong, so perhaps the second H+ isn't considered in the neutralization.

Wait, no, in strong acids like H2SO4, both H+ are considered to dissociate completely. Or do they? Wait, actually, in aqueous solution, H2SO4 is a strong acid which dissociates completely in two steps. The first H+ comes off completely, but the second H+ (from HSO4^-) is a weaker acid and doesn't completely dissociate. But for the purpose of neutralization, perhaps only the first H+ is considered. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, if H2SO4 only donates one H+ fully, then the second H+ isn't available for neutralization. So let me recalculate that.

HCl: 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 moles, each giving 1 H+ → 0.09 H+.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.09 = 0.19.

OH-: 0.2.

So in that case, the OH- is more than the H+? Wait, no. 0.19 H+ and 0.2 OH- → H+ is the limiting reagent.

So moles of H+ reacting: 0.19. OH- reacting: 0.19, leaving 0.01 OH-.

So the enthalpy change would be 0.19 × (-57.1) ≈ -10.85 kJ.

But that's not matching any options either.

This is getting confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH- per mole, so 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 moles OH-.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier. So perhaps I was correct the first time.

So if the correct calculation is 0.2 moles of H+ reacting, giving -11.42 kJ, which is approximately -11.4 kJ, but the options don't have that. The closest is option D: -16 kJ, which is significantly higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of moles.

Let me recalculate all the moles.

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L. 0.5 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L. 0.3 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+ → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL = 0.2 L. 0.2 L × 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH- → 0.2 mol OH-.

So H+ total = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

OH- is 0.2.

So the OH- is the limiting reagent. So 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react.

So 0.2 × 57.1 kJ = 11.42 kJ released, so ΔH is -11.42 kJ.

Wait, but the options don't have this. The options are:

A) -2.72 kcal → which is about -11.4 kJ (since 11.4 kJ ≈ 2.72 kcal).

Because 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ.

So 2.72 kcal is 2.72 × 4.184 ≈ 11.4 kJ.

So option B is -11.42 kcal → which is about -47.7 kJ. Wait, no, no. Wait, 11.42 kcal is 47.7 kJ. So option B would be -47.7 kJ, which is way higher than our calculation.

Wait, that's a miscalculation. Let me think again.

Wait, the question asks for the enthalpy of neutralization when these are mixed. So the total enthalpy change is for the moles of H+ and OH- that reacted, which is 0.2 moles. So if each mole of H+ contributes -57.1 kJ, then 0.2 × (-57.1) = -11.42 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. That's not matching, but none of the options have -11.42 kJ. Wait, but maybe the problem expects the answer in kcal, not kJ. Let me convert -11.42 kJ to kcal.

Since 1 kJ = 0.239 kcal, so -11.42 kJ × 0.239 = approximately -2.72 kcal. So that would be option A. But earlier calculation said that option A is -2.72 kcal, which would be the same as -11.4 kJ.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing the heat of neutralization. Wait, another possibility: the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of reaction. For example, when 1 mole of H+ neutralizes 1 mole of OH-, the ΔH is -57.1 kJ. So for 0.2 moles, it's 0.2 × (-57.1) = -11.42 kJ.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option D: -16.0 kJ. But how do I get that? Did I make a mistake in the moles?

Wait, maybe I should consider the total volume and find the concentration, but no, since the enthalpy is per mole.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the problem is about the total moles of H+ and OH- and finding the net moles of H+ or OH- remaining. Because if there's excess, the solution would be acidic or basic, but the neutralization enthalpy is only for the neutral part.

Wait, in this case, there are 0.28 moles H+ and 0.2 moles OH-. So 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles H+ remaining. So the neutralization involves 0.2 moles.

So the enthalpy is 0.2 × (-57.1) = -11.42 kJ.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options again, option D is -16.0 kJ. Maybe I'm using the wrong value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Maybe it's -36 kJ per mole or something else?

Wait, standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is about -57 kJ/mol, but maybe the problem uses a different value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but only the first H+ is reacting, giving 0.09 moles of H+.

So H+ total would be 0.1 (HCl) + 0.09 (H2SO4) = 0.19. OH- is 0.2. So H+ is limiting.

So 0.19 × (-57.1) = -10.85 kJ. Rounded, that's about -10.9 kJ. Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in calories. Wait, but the options have kcal, which is kilocalories.

Wait, I think I might have to re-express the calculation.

Wait, let's compute 0.2 moles × (-57.1 kJ/mol) = -11.42 kJ.

But in the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, that's not correct because 11.42 kJ is about 2.72 kcal, not 11.42.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ but has a mistake in the options. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the calculation.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem is considering that Ba(OH)2 can donate two OH- ions, so perhaps the H+ and OH- are in the same solution, but the way they mix affects the calculation. No, I think the approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply by the number of equivalents. H2SO4 provides 2 equivalents, but only one is strong. Hmm, but that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the heat for each acid-base reaction separately and sum them.

Let me try that.

First, HCl and Ba(OH)2 reaction:

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

The reaction: 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

The mole ratio is 2 HCl : 1 Ba(OH)2.

HCl: 0.1 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 moles.

So the reaction would require 0.2 moles HCl and 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2. We have only 0.1 HCl and 0.1 Ba(OH)2, so they would exactly react in a 1:1 ratio, producing 0.1 moles BaCl2 and 0.2 moles H2O.

The enthalpy change for this reaction would be:

Each mole of HCl contributes -57.1 kJ when neutralized. Since 0.1 moles HCl are reacting, that's 0.1 × (-57.1) = -5.71 kJ.

But wait, wait, when HCl reacts with Ba(OH)2, each mole of HCl gives one H+, and each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH-. So the reaction is:

2 H+ + 2 OH- → 2 H2O.

So for 0.1 mole Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

0.1 mole HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

So the reaction would be: 0.1 H+ + 0.2 OH- → 0.1 H2O.

Wait, but that's not a balanced equation. Hmm, perhaps the enthalpy calculation for this part is 0.1 moles H+ × (-57.1 kJ/mol) = -5.71 kJ.

Then, the remaining H+ comes from H2SO4.

H2SO4 (0.09 moles) → 0.18 moles H+.

But previously, the Ba(OH)2 used up 0.2 moles OH-, but only 0.1 moles H+ were available from HCl. So the remaining OH- is 0.2 - 0.1 = 0.1 moles OH-? No, wait.

Wait, perhaps this approach is complicating. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to find the net moles of H+ or OH- after mixing all solutions, then calculate the heat based on that.

So, total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

Total OH- = 0.2.

Net H+ = 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles.

So the solution is acidic, with excess H+. But the enthalpy of neutralization is only for the neutral part, which is 0.2 moles.

So once again, 0.2 × (-57.1) = -11.42 kJ.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. How would that happen?

Hmm, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Let me think, maybe it's -80 kJ per mole. 0.2 × (-80) = -16 kJ, which would match option D.

But why would the enthalpy be -80 kJ? That's higher than standard. Maybe the problem expects the total H+ and OH- from all sources, considering that H2SO4 is diprotic, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total equivalents of H+ and OH-.

HCl: 0.5 L × 0.2 N = 0.1 equivalents (since N = M for HCl, which gives 1 H+).

H2SO4: 0.3 L × 0.3 M × 2 = 0.18 equivalents (since each mole gives 2 H+).

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L × 0.5 M × 2 = 0.2 equivalents (since each mole gives 2 OH-).

So total equivalents:

H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 eq.

OH- = 0.2 eq.

Neutralization: 0.2 eq OH- neutralizes 0.2 eq H+.

So the heat is 0.2 × 57.1 kJ = 11.42 kJ, so ΔH = -11.42 kJ.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So maybe the answer is option B: -11.42 kcal. Because 11.42 kJ is about 2.72 kcal, but option B is -11.42 kcal, which would be approximately -47.7 kJ (since 11.42 kcal × 4.184 ≈ 47.7 kJ). That doesn't make sense, as our calculation is 11.42 kJ.

Hmm, perhaps I should recheck the problem statement. The problem says to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when the three solutions are mixed. So perhaps I'm to assume all the H+ and OH- neutralize, but that can't be right because there's excess H+.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that all the OH- is used, and the rest of the H+ is ignored. So the heat is only from the OH- reacting.

Which is what I did earlier, leading to -11.42 kJ, but that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) -2.72 kcal → approx -11.4 kJ.

B) -11.42 kcal → approx -47.7 kJ.

C) -3.80 kcal → approx -16.0 kJ.

D) -16.0 kJ.

Ah, wait a minute. Option C is -3.80 kcal, which is about -16.0 kJ (since 3.8 ×4.184≈16). So option C is -16.0 kJ when converted. Hmm.

So perhaps the calculation is 0.32 moles of H+ reacting? But where would that come from.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the moles.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-.

H+ total: 0.28.

OH-: 0.2.

So the neutralization is 0.2 moles.

But perhaps the problem is considering that H2SO4 contributes twice as much, or that Ba(OH)2 is a diprotic base, so it's providing two OH- per mole. Wait, I have already accounted for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the total neutralization is based on the total equivalents, so 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH- gives 0.2 neutralized, and the remaining 0.08 H+ is not neutralized.

So the enthalpy is 0.2 × 57.1 = 11.42 kJ released, so ΔH = -11.42 kJ.

But none of the options have that. Wait, looking again, option D is -16.0 kJ which is approximately -16.0 kJ. So if the calculation gives 16.0 kJ, which is 0.2 × 80 kJ per mole, but why would the enthalpy be 80 kJ?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles.

Let me recheck:

HCl: 0.5 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L × 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

So total H+ is 0.28, OH- 0.2.

So 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react.

So 0.2 × 57.1 = 11.42 kJ → ΔH = -11.42 kJ.

But that's not an option. So perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal. Let's calculate 11.42 kJ in kcal.

11.42 kJ × (1 kcal / 4.184 kJ) ≈ 2.72 kcal.

So that's about -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But earlier I thought the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ and standard value is 57.1 kJ/mol, which would give 11.42 kJ, which is option A in kcal.

Wait, but the options have option B as -11.42 kcal, which is about -47.7 kJ. That seems way off.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the total volume and thus dilution, but no, enthalpy of neutralization is per mole and doesn't depend on volume.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the problem is considering that the neutralization is between all the H+ and OH-, but the options don't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to calculate the total heat released, which would be for all possible neutralization. But that's not correct because there's excess H+.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that all the H+ from H2SO4 is strong and that I calculate based on that.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the moles of H+ and OH- and see which is in excess, then calculate the enthalpy accordingly.

H+ = 0.28.

OH- = 0.2.

So, 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- neutralize, and 0.08 moles of H+ remain.

So, the enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57.1) = -11.42 kJ.

But no option matches. Unless the problem expects the answer in kcal, which would be approximately -2.72 kcal (option A). Or perhaps the problem uses a different value for the enthalpy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the total neutralization without considering excess. But that doesn't make sense because the solution would have excess H+.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that all H+ and OH- are neutralized, but that's not possible here because H+ is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the H+ calculation for H2SO4. Let me double-check.

H2SO4 dissociates as H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, actually, in reality, the first H+ is fully dissociated, and the second is only partially. So in a 0.3 M H2SO4 solution, the first dissociation gives 0.3 M H+ and 0.3 M HSO4^-.

The second dissociation, HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-, is not complete, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps they consider both H+ fully available. So H2SO4 gives 2 H+ per mole.

So 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

So earlier calculation holds.

Another thought: perhaps the problem expects the use of the formula q = n × ΔH, where ΔH is the heat of neutralization. So for 0.2 moles, q is 0.2 × (-57.1) = -11.42 kJ.

Looking again at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. So maybe the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in units—maybe the problem expects the total heat in kJ, but perhaps I have to multiply by something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the sum of all H+ and OH- but that doesn't make sense because OH- is the limiting reagent.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the overall reaction is between the acids and the base as a whole, not individual neutralizations.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is:

HCl + H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → ?

But that's complicated. Let me think about the overall reaction.

Ba(OH)2 is a base. It will react with the acids HCl and H2SO4. The overall reaction would be:

HCl + H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + BaCl2 + H2O.

Wait, but that's a bit more complex. Let me write the net ionic equation.

H+ (from HCl and H2SO4) + OH- (from Ba(OH)2) → H2O.

So, the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So as before, 0.2 moles react.

Thus, the calculation remains the same.

So perhaps the correct answer is not present in the options. But that can't be, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering that each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 equivalents of H+, and each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 equivalents of OH-, so the equivalents are:

HCl: 0.1 eq.

H2SO4: 0.18 eq.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 eq.

So total H+ equivalents: 0.28.

Total OH- equivalents: 0.2.

Net H+ = 0.08.

So the heat from neutralization is for 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 H+ left.

Wait, no, that's not right. The neutralization is between the available H+ and OH-.

So the heat is from 0.2 moles reacting. So -11.42 kJ.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Let me think: if the enthalpy is -36 kJ per mole, then 0.2 × (-36) = -7.2 kJ. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using -40 kJ per mole.

0.2 × 40 = 8 → -8 kJ. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the total heat based on the moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the neutralization is between the H+ and OH- that are present, regardless of the source.

So, 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH- → 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH- react, producing 0.2 H2O.

So, 0.2 × (-57.1) = -11.42 kJ.

But if the options don't have this, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal.

Wait, 11.42 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal (since 11.42 /4.184 ≈ 2.72). So the answer would be -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But why would the problem present the options mixed in kcal and kJ? Hmm.

Looking back, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is about -16 kJ. So if our calculation is -11.42 kJ, none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the moles.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the moles again.

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L. 0.5 L × 0.2 M = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L × 0.3 M = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L × 0.5 M = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

So, that's correct.

So, I'm confident that the correct enthalpy change is -11.42 kJ, which isn't an option. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal, making option A correct (-2.72 kcal), which equals approximately -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about -11.4 kJ. So the correct answer would be option A.

But then why is option B there with -11.42 kcal?

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem asks for the total enthalpy change, which is the neutralization plus any other factors, but I don't think so.

I'm a bit stuck, but I'll proceed to say that the correct answer is option D: -16.0 kJ, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should go with the calculation that gives -11.42 kJ, which is option B in kcal, but that would be -47.7 kJ, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the problem's possible approach. Another way: perhaps the problem isn't considering the stoichiometry correctly.

Wait, what if the problem calculates the total moles of H+ and OH- and then finds the net, but that's not the right approach for enthalpy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the H2SO4 only donates one H+ ion, so H+ total is 0.1 + 0.09 = 0.19 moles. Then, OH- is 0.2, so H+ is limiting. So 0.19 moles react, giving 0.19 × (-57.1) = -10.85 kJ, which is approx -10.9 kJ, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that H2SO4 gives two H+, but only one reacts because the other isn't strong. So, H+ total is 0.1 + 0.09 = 0.19.

So, 0.19 × (-57.1) = -10.85 kJ. Still no option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Let me think: if the enthalpy is -36 kJ per mole, then 0.2 × (-36) = -7.2 kJ. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses -40 kJ per mole → 0.2 × (-40)= -8 kJ. Not an option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the heat released per liter of solution, but I don't think so. Because enthalpy is per mole.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem made a mistake in the options, but I have to choose the best fit.

In summary, I'm confident that the correct enthalpy change is -11.42 kJ. Since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option D: -16.0 kJ, but I don't know why. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal, making option A correct.

But wait, 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 H+ left. So the solution is acidic, but the neutralization enthalpy is only for the neutralized part.

So after all this, I think the correct answer is option D: -16.0 kJ. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the total moles of H+ and OH- are 0.28 and 0.2, but perhaps the moles of H2SO4 is 0.09, which is 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 H+.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is correct, but the problem expects the answer in kcal. So 11.42 kJ is 2.72 kcal, which is option A.

So I think the correct answer is option A: -2.72 kcal.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps were taken:

1. **Determine moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since HCl dissociates completely, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

   - **H₂SO₄ (strong acid, diprotic):**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes \( 2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \), so total \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into \( 2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \), so total \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

2. **Identify the limiting reactant:**
   - Total \( \text{H}^+ \) available = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Total \( \text{OH}^- \) available = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Since \( \text{OH}^- \) is the limiting reactant, only \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \) will react.

3. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57.1 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).  
   - For \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \) reacting:  
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57.1) = -11.42 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]

4. **Convert to kcal if necessary:**
   - \( 1 \, \text{kJ} = 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \), so:  
     \[
     -11.42 \, \text{kJ} \times 0.239 = -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
     \]

5. **Analyze the options:**
   - **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Matches the calculated value of \( -11.42 \, \text{kJ} \) when converted to kcal.  
   - **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** This would correspond to \( -47.7 \, \text{kJ} \), which is incorrect.  
   - **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** This corresponds to \( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \), which is inconsistent with the calculation.  
   - **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** This does not match the calculated value of \( -11.42 \, \text{kJ} \).

Based on the calculations, the correct answer is **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**, as it aligns with the enthalpy change when converted from kJ to kcal.

Answer: A
