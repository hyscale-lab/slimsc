Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

The question says that the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. I remember that in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. So the fundamental state would be the state where both the vibrational and rotational energies are at their lowest, which is the ground state for both.

The molecule is made up of atoms X and Y. Their masses are given: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. The angular frequency ω is 4e14 rad/s.

The question is asking about the momentum of a photon that needs to be absorbed so the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state. Wait, the next state—so the molecule transitions to the next higher energy state. Since the model combines both rotation and vibration, I need to think about what the transition rules are.

In the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized. The energy for a diatomic molecule can be described by the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. The rotational energy levels are quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, and J is the rotational quantum number (0,1,2...). The vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (n + ½) hω, where n is the vibrational quantum number (0,1,2...).

The fundamental state is when both J and n are at their lowest. So n=0 and J=0. The next state must be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state, but which transition is allowed here?

But wait, in molecular spectroscopy, the selection rules usually allow for transitions where either J changes by ±1 (ΔJ=±1) for rotational transitions, and Δn=±1 for vibrational transitions. But when both are involved, like in the ro-vibrational spectrum, the transitions are when Δn=±1 and ΔJ=±1.

Wait, no, that's for the allowed transitions. So for a photon to cause a transition from the fundamental state (n=0, J=0) to the next higher state, what's the next possible? The next state could either be a higher vibrational state (n=1) with J=0, or a higher rotational state (J=1) with n=0, or maybe a combination like n=1 and J=1. But the "next lowest" state would probably be the one with the least energy increase.

Wait, but in terms of energy levels, which transition gives the least energy? The vibrational energy is higher than the rotational energy for the same quantum number. Let me think: the vibrational energy for n=1 is (1 + 0.5) hω = 1.5 hω. The rotational energy for J=1 is B*(1)(2) = 2B. Which is larger? It depends on B and ω.

Hmm, but I'm not given B. I can calculate B from the given data. The rotational constant B is given by (ℏ²) / (2 I ω₀), wait, no, I think the formula is B = (h²)/(8π² I c), no wait, another approach. Maybe B is (h²)/(8π² I), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = (h²)/(8 π² I), and I is the moment of inertia, I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

So first, let's compute the reduced mass μ.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) = (40) / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, I need to convert this to kilograms. 1 amu is about 1.66e-27 kg. So μ ≈ (20/11) * 1.66e-27 kg.

Calculating that: 20/11 ≈ 1.818, so 1.818 * 1.66e-27 ≈ around 3.02e-27 kg.

The moment of inertia I is μ R². R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

So I = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.208e-46 kg m².

Now, B is h²/(8 π² I). Let me compute that.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J s.

So h² = (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J² s².

8 π² is about 8*(9.8696) ≈ 78.957.

So B = (4.39e-67) / (78.957 * 1.208e-46) = let's compute the denominator first: 78.957 * 1.208e-46 ≈ 95.29e-46 ≈ 9.529e-45.

So B ≈ 4.39e-67 / 9.529e-45 ≈ 4.605e-23 J.

Wait, but that seems a bit small. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, 4.39e-67 divided by 9.529e-45 is (4.39 / 9.529) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.4606 * 1e-22 = 4.606e-23 J. Hmm, okay.

But what about the vibrational energy? The vibrational energy for n=0 is ½ hω, and for n=1, it's 3/2 hω.

So the energy difference when going from n=0 to n=1 is hω.

The energy difference when going from J=0 to J=1 is E_rot for J=1 minus E_rot for J=0. E_rot for J=0 is 0, and for J=1 it's B*(1)(2)=2B. So the energy difference is 2B.

So the two possible transitions are:

1. From n=0, J=0 to n=0, J=1: requires energy 2B.
2. From n=0, J=0 to n=1, J=0: requires energy hω.

Which of these is lower? Let's see: We have B ≈ 4.605e-23 J and ω is 4e14 rad/s.

h is 6.626e-34 J s. So hω is 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

What's 2B? 2 * 4.605e-23 = 9.21e-23 J.

Comparing 2.65e-19 J and 9.21e-23 J, the energy required to increase the vibrational state is much higher than increasing the rotational state. So the lower energy transition would be the J=0 → J=1, requiring 2B.

Wait, but wait: when you have a photon being absorbed, the energy of the photon must match the energy difference of the transition. So the photon's energy should be equal to the energy difference between the two states.

So, if the molecule is in the fundamental state (n=0, J=0), the next possible state would either be (n=0, J=1) or (n=1, J=0), depending on which requires less energy.

Since 2B is about 9.2e-23 J, and hω is about 2.65e-19 J, the lower energy transition is to (n=0, J=1). So the photon's energy needed is 2B.

Wait, but the question is about the momentum of the photon. Because the photon's energy is related to its momentum by E = pc, where p is momentum and c is the speed of light.

So, if the photon's energy is 2B, then p = E/c.

So let's compute p.

p = 2B / c.

We have 2B = 9.21e-23 J.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p ≈ 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, that's 3.07e-31 kg m/s, but looking at the options, none of them are that small. The options are around 1e-27 to 2e-27 N*s.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B. Let me recheck the calculation of B.

B = h²/(8 π² I).

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 (J s)^2.

I = 1.208e-46 kg m².

So 8 π² I is 8 * (π)^2 * 1.208e-46.

π^2 is about 9.8696, so 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.957.

78.957 * 1.208e-46 = 78.957 * 1.208 = approx 95.29e-46 = 9.529e-45 kg m².

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.529e-45 = (4.39 /9.529) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.4606 * 1e-22 = 4.606e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.21e-23 J.

Hmm, so p = 9.21e-23 / (3e8) = ~3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but the options are in N*s. Oh wait, 1 N s is equal to 1 kg m/s. So the units are the same.

So the calculated p is about 3.07e-31 N s, but none of the options are anywhere near this. Wait, the options are A) 1.9e-28, B) 2.3e-27, etc.

Wait, perhaps I got the wrong transition. Maybe the next state is a combination of both vibrational and rotational changes, like from (n=0, J=0) to (n=1, J=1). But the energy difference would be hω + 2B, which would be even higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the next state is a vibrational transition (n=1, J=0), which requires energy hω=2.65e-19 J.

Wait, but that's higher energy than the rotational transition. So if the question is about the photon being absorbed to switch to the next lowest energy state, which would be the one with the least energy difference, that's the rotational transition, which requires 2B.

But according to my calculation, the momentum is about 3e-31 Ns, which is not in the options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me check the formula for B again.

Wait, the formula for B is (h²)/(8 π² I).

Wait, I think I got that right. So maybe I made a mistake in the reduced mass or moment of inertia.

Let me recheck the reduced mass.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Ah, wait, wait. 20 amu and 2 amu. So Mx is 20u, My is 2u. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 u.

But the moment of inertia I is μ R². R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = 1.818 u * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, 1 u is 1.66e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

So I = 3.02e-27 kg * (4e-20 m²) = 1.208e-46 kg m².

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should be using the rotational constant in terms of cm^-1 or other units. Wait, no, because the formula I used for B is in Joules.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct transition is a vibrational one, but I'm getting higher energy. So why is the calculated p not matching the options?

Wait, let me think about it differently. Maybe the next state includes an increase in both J and n.

Wait, but the fundamental state is (n=0, J=0). The next possible state could be (n=0, J=1) which requires 2B, or (n=1, J=0) which requires hω, or (n=1, J=1) which requires hω + 2B.

Which of these is the next state in terms of energy? The order would be: if 2B < hω, then the rotational transition is lower in energy. Let's compute 2B and hω.

We have 2B ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

hω = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So 2B is about 9e-23 J, which is much less than 2.6e-19 J. So the rotational transition to J=1 requires a lower energy photon than the vibrational transition.

So the molecule would transition to (n=0, J=1) first, which requires a photon with energy 2B.

So the photon's momentum would be p = E/c = (2B)/c.

Wait, but 2B is 9.21e-23 J.

So p = 9.21e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 N s.

But wait, the options are all in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. That's three to four orders of magnitude higher than what I calculated.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the rotational constant B in terms of angular frequency, which is sometimes given by B = ħ²/(2 I), but I might have used the wrong formula.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, which has units of energy. The formula for B is (ħ²)/(2 I), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/(2π)).

Wait wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula for B.

Let me double-check the formula for B.

The rotational energy levels are E_rot = (ħ²/(2 I)) J (J+1). So B = ħ²/(2 I).

Wait, ħ is h/(2π) = 6.626e-34 / (2 * 3.1416) ≈ 1.054e-34 J s.

So ħ² is (1.054e-34)^2 ≈ 1.11e-68 J² s².

So B = (1.11e-68) / (2 * I).

I is 1.208e-46 kg m².

So 2 I = 2.416e-46.

So B = 1.11e-68 / 2.416e-46 ≈ 4.60e-23 J.

Same result as before. So B is 4.6e-23 J.

Hmm, so that part is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the question is referring to a vibrational transition, but that requires a higher energy. So maybe the question is expecting me to calculate the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition, which is hω/c.

Let me compute that.

h is 6.626e-34 J s.

ω is 4e14 rad/s.

So hω = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

c is 3e8 m/s.

p = hω / c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, A is 1.9e-28, and C is 1.1e-27.

Hmm, 8.8e-28 is close to option A (1.9e-28) but not exactly. Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation here.

Wait, let me compute hω again.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

ω = 4e14 rad/s.

hω = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = (6.626 *4) * 1e-34+14 = 26.504e-20 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Divided by c=3e8 m/s, p=2.6504e-19 / 3e8 = 8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

So p=8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28. So none of the options match exactly. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should be using the vibrational contribution, but the problem statement says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy". So it's looking for the transition with the least energy. Which would be the rotational one, which gives a lower p, but none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass.

Wait, the reduced mass is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So (20 *2)=40, divided by 22, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should convert the bond length into meters correctly. 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters.

Yes, I think that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the model is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor, but in this case, the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model. Does that affect anything? Oh, the non-rigid rotor model allows for bond elongation, which affects the moment of inertia. But I'm not sure how to handle that in this calculation. Maybe it doesn't impact the selection of the transition but affects the energy levels. Hmm, but I think the approach I took still holds.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground vibrational state to the first excited vibrational state (n=1) with J=0. Because that's the next state in energy.

Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, the energy for that transition is hω = 2.65e-19 J, which gives a photon momentum of ~8.8e-28 kg m/s.

But none of the options are that. The closest is option A (1.9e-28) and D (1.4e-28). So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check the calculation of hω again.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

ω = 4e14 rad/s.

hω = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Yes.

c = 3e8 m/s.

p = 2.6504e-19 / 3e8 = 8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

Wait, what's the value of 8.83e-28? It's about 8.8e-28 Ns, which is larger than option D (1.4e-28) and option A (1.9e-28). So why isn't this matching any of the options?

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is n=0, J=0.

The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the next higher energy state, which is either (n=0, J=1) or (n=1, J=0). The one with lower energy is (n=0, J=1), which requires 2B. So the photon's energy is 2B, and its momentum is (2B)/c.

Earlier, I found 2B to be 9.21e-23 J. So p = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But that's way smaller than any of the options. So perhaps the question expects me to consider a different transition, perhaps the first vibrational state with some rotational level.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the energy difference for the transition to (n=1, J=1), which would be E_vib + E_rot = (hω + 2B).

Wait, but that would be even higher than both transitions.

Hmm... Alternatively, maybe I should think about the selection rules. In ro-vibrational transitions, the photon induces a change in both n and J. So the allowed transitions have Δn = ±1 and ΔJ = ±1.

So the transition from (n=0, J=0) would be to (n=1, J=1). The energy difference would be [ (n=1, J=1) ] - [ (n=0, J=0) ].

Let me compute that.

E_vib for n=1 is (1 + ½) hω = 1.5 hω.

E_rot for J=1 is B * 1*(1+1) = 2B.

So the total energy for (n=1, J=1) is 1.5 hω + 2B.

The energy for (n=0, J=0) is 0 + 0 = 0.

So the energy difference ΔE is 1.5 hω + 2B.

But that's more energy than just either transition alone. So the photon's energy would be even higher. So that's not the next state.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let's try another approach. Maybe I should calculate the possible ΔE for each possible transition and see which is the smallest.

Possible transitions from (n=0, J=0):

1. (n=0, J=1): ΔE = 2B ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

2. (n=1, J=0): ΔE = hω ≈ 2.65e-19 J.

3. (n=1, J=1): ΔE = 1.5 hω + 2B ≈ 3.975e-19 + 9.21e-23 ≈ approx 3.975e-19 J.

So the smallest ΔE is 2B (~9e-23 J). So the photon's energy is 2B, which gives p=3e-31 Ns.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the photon to cause a transition that includes both vibrational and rotational changes, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for B. Let's think about the units.

The rotational energy is E_rot = (h²/(8 π² I)) * J (J+1). So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should express the rotational constant in terms of wavenumbers, but I don't think that's necessary here.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is considering only the vibrational transition because rotation is a higher energy state, but that doesn't make sense because 2B is much smaller than hω.

Wait, but the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy".

So the next state with the lowest energy would be the one that requires the least energy to reach. So it would be the (n=0, J=1) state, requiring 2B.

So the photon's energy is 2B, and its momentum is p = 2B/c.

But looking back at the options, none match this. So perhaps something is wrong with my approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the quantum rotation-vibration model includes the zero-point energy. But the fundamental state is already the ground state, so any transition would be to a higher state.

Alternatively, perhaps the model used combines rotational and vibrational contributions in a way that the next state is a combination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy difference between (n=0, J=0) and (n=0, J=1), and (n=0, J=0) and (n=1, J=0), and see which is smaller.

Earlier, 2B is ~9e-23 J, and hω is ~2.65e-19 J. So 2B is much smaller, so the transition to J=1 is lower in energy.

So the photon's momentum is 3e-31 Ns, but that's not an option. So I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the question is not considering the rotational state but only the vibration. Maybe it's a typo or misunderstanding.

Wait, the problem says "quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor model)". The non-rigid rotor model allows for changes in bond length, which affects the moment of inertia. But I'm not sure how that affects the transition.

Wait, perhaps the model uses a different formula for B. Let me think. B is given by (h²)/(8 π² I), but sometimes B is expressed in terms of angular frequency for rotation: B = ħ²/(2 I), which is the same as (h²)/(8 π² I) * (π^2) = h²/(8 π² I) * (π^2) )= (h² π²) / (8 π² I) )= h²/(8 I). Wait no, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the formulas.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to get the formula right. The rotational energy levels are given by E = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, which is defined as:

B = (h²) / (8 π² I)

where I is the moment of inertia.

Alternatively, sometimes B is expressed as:

B = (ħ²) / (2 I), where ħ is h/(2π).

Which one is correct?

Yes, because ħ = h/(2π), so ħ² = h²/(4 π²). So,

B = ħ²/(2 I) = (h²/(4 π²)) / (2 I) )= h²/(8 π² I).

Yes, same as before. So the calculation is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should reevaluate if the problem is about the vibrational transition, given that the options are much larger than the calculated rotational transition.

If the photon's momentum is 8.8e-28 Ns (for hω), which is about 8.8e-28. The closest option is A (1.9e-28) and D (1.4e-28). But neither is close. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of hω.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the angular frequency ω is given in terms of the vibrational frequency, so the photon's energy is hω. So p = hω/c.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps the given ω is the rotational angular frequency, not the vibrational. That could change things.

Wait, the question says that ω is the angular frequency of vibration. So no, it's the vibrational frequency.

Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the momentum of the photon that allows the molecule to transition to the first excited state, which could be a combination of both vibrational and rotational transitions. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can't transition just rotationally because of selection rules. For example, if the rotational transition ΔJ=±1 is forbidden, but that's not usually the case. In diatomic molecules, ΔJ=±1 is allowed for rotational transitions, and Δn=±1 is allowed for vibrational.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed in such a way that the next state is the first vibrational state, and the rotational state is considered in a rigid rotor model, which is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the vibrational energy difference and see which option comes close.

Wait, the computed hω/c is 8.8e-28 Ns, which is not exactly matching any option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass.

Wait, let me recompute the reduced mass.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2) =40/22= 1.818 amu.

Converted to kg: 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg = approx 3.02e-27 kg.

Yes, that's correct.

Moment of inertia I = μ R^2 = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m².

Yes.

So B = h^2/(8 π² I) = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 * π² * 1.208e-46).

Compute denominator: 8 * (9.8696) ≈78.957.

78.957 * 1.208e-46 = 78.957 *1.208= approx 95.29e-46=9.529e-45.

So numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67.

B = 4.39e-67 /9.529e-45 = 4.606e-23 J.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator model, and the next state is the first vibrational state, ignoring rotation. But the question mentions the rotation-vibration model, so that should include both.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=1 for the same vibrational state. So the energy difference is 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J. So the photon's momentum is 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are way off. So perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the bond length R is given in angstroms, which is 2e-10 m, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of wavenumbers or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to consider the vibrational transition as the only possible option, leading to p=8.8e-28 Ns, but none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the photon's wavelength instead of momentum, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy difference between the rotational state and the first vibrational state.

Wait, the energy for (n=0, J=1) is 2B, and the energy for (n=1, J=0) is hω. The next state could be either, but the one with lower energy is 2B.

But if the problem is considering the next state in terms of the overall energy, perhaps the first vibrational state is higher than the first rotational state, so the next state is the rotational one.

But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a mistake in calculation.

Wait, wait, another thought: perhaps the photon's energy is not just the rotational energy but includes both rotational and vibrational. But no, because the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy," which would be the transition requiring the least energy.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 3 in the energy difference. Let me think: Oh wait, the vibrational energy is quantized as E_vib = (n + ½) hω. So the difference between n=0 and n=1 is hω.

So the photon's energy is hω.

p = hω/c = (6.626e-34 *4e14)/(3e8) = (2.65e-19)/(3e8) = 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Which is 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, B is 2.3e-27, C is 1.1e-27, D is 1.4e-28.

Hmm, so none match exactly. But perhaps I made a miscalculation in the reduced mass or moment of inertia.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the reduced mass again.

Mx = 20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 = 1.81818 amu.

Converting to kg: 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

Yes, correct.

Moment of inertia I = μ R^2 = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m².

Correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the photon's energy as the sum of both vibrational and rotational contributions, but that's not necessary for the next state.

Wait, perhaps the question expects the photon to have enough energy to promote the molecule to the first excited vibrational state, regardless of the rotational state. So, the photon's energy is hω, and the momentum is 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation of hω.

Wait, let's re-calculate hω.

h=6.62607015e-34 J s (exact value, as per SI).

ω=4e14 rad/s.

hω = 6.62607015e-34 *4e14 = 2.65042806e-19 J.

Divide by c=299792458 m/s (exact value ≈3e8 m/s).

p = 2.65042806e-19 / 2.9979e8 ≈ 8.836e-28 kg m/s.

So, approximately 8.84e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A (1.9e-28) and D (1.4e-28), but neither are close. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the photon's momentum when the molecule goes from the ground state to the first rotational state, which requires energy 2B. So let's compute that.

p = 2B / c = (9.21e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 Ns.

Still way off from the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the energy difference but about the photon's momentum as a fraction of the molecule's momentum. But I don't think that's relevant.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to use the vibrational energy, but I calculated the momentum as 8.8e-28, which is not in the options. So perhaps I should consider another possibility: maybe the question is about the transition from J=0 to J=2, but that's not allowed under selection rules (ΔJ=±1).

Alternatively, perhaps the model used is different, such as the Rigid Rotor and Harmonic Oscillator model, where the energy levels are E = (n + ½) hω + B J (J+1).

In that case, the next state could be n=1, J=0, which would have E = 1.5 hω.

So the energy difference is 1.5 hω.

p = 1.5 hω / c.

1.5 * 2.65e-19 = 3.975e-19 J.

p=3.975e-19 / 3e8 = 1.325e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28. Close enough?

Hmm, perhaps that's it. So maybe the transition is to n=1, J=1, but that would require 1.5 hω + 2B, which is higher.

Wait, no, the next state after n=0, J=0 would be (n=1, J=0) with energy 1.5 hω. So the photon's energy is 1.5 hω.

Wait, but earlier I thought that's not correct because the rotational transition is lower in energy. But perhaps the problem is considering only the vibrational transition. So perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the photon momentum for 1.5 hω, which gives p= (1.5 * 6.626e-34 * 4e14)/3e8.

Wait, let's compute that.

1.5 *6.626e-34 = 9.939e-34.

9.939e-34 * 4e14 = 3.9756e-19 J.

Divide by 3e8: 3.9756e-19 /3e8 = 1.325e-28 kg m/s.

Which is approximately 1.3e-28 Ns. Option D is 1.4e-28, which is close.

Wait, perhaps that's the intended answer. So if the photon's energy is 1.5 hω, which is the energy for the transition to n=1, J=0, then p=1.3e-28 Ns, which is option D (1.4e-28). But why would the next state have n=1, J=0? Because the rotational transition requires less energy, so why would the molecule transition to a higher energy vibrational state first?

Ah, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state is the one with the next higher energy, regardless of whether it's rotational or vibrational.

Wait, the fundamental state is (n=0, J=0). The next state would be the one with the least energy above that. So (n=0, J=1) has E=2B≈9e-23 J. The (n=1, J=0) state has E=1.5 hω≈3.975e-19 J.

Since 9e-23 J is smaller than 3.975e-19 J, the next state would be (n=0, J=1). So the photon's energy is 9e-23 J, and p=3e-31 Ns. But none of the options match that.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem is expecting the answer to be the vibrational transition, even though it's higher energy.

But why? That doesn't make sense because the next state would be the one with the least energy difference.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the next state in terms of energy but the next state in terms of quantum numbers. But that doesn't make sense either.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing some key point.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the transition as a change in vibrational state with Δn=+1 and ΔJ=+1, but that would require more energy.

But the problem says "next state with the lowest possible energy," so it's the one with the least energy increase.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to proceed with the initial approach and see which option is closest.

But in my initial approach, the rotational transition gives a photon momentum of 3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider both the vibrational and rotational transitions together, but that would require even more energy.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is actually considering the transition from the rotational ground state (J=0) to the first vibrational state (n=1), which would require the photon's energy to be hω, regardless of J. So the photon's momentum would be 8.8e-28 Ns. But none of the options match.

Wait, option B is 2.3e-27 Ns, which is three orders of magnitude larger than 8.8e-28. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the energy.

Wait, let me recompute hω.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

ω =4e14 rad/s.

hω =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Yes, correct.

p =2.6504e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 Ns.

Hmm, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about 2.14 times smaller than my calculation. So perhaps I should recheck the calculation of hω.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of ω. Let me read the question again. The angular frequency is given as 4e14 rad/s. Correct.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider the reduced mass in atomic mass units (u) but not converted into kg? No, because in the formula for B, I must use SI units.

Alternatively, perhaps I used the wrong formula for B. Let me try to compute B in a different way.

Wait, another formula for rotational constant is B = (h c )/(4 π² c I), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is expressed in cm^-1, but that's usually when using spectroscopic notation.

Wait, perhaps B is expressed in terms of cm^-1, but I don't think that affects the calculation here.

Hmm. I'm not sure where I'm going wrong. I think I'll proceed with the initial approach, assuming that the correct answer is the rotational transition, but given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option A, which is 1.9e-28 Ns, corresponding to the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the photon's momentum to be the vibrational contribution (hω/c), which is 8.8e-28, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I should look for any possible miscalculations in the reduced mass or bond length.

Wait, bond length R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. Correct.

Reduced mass μ in kg: 1.818 amu * 1.66e-27 kg/amu = 3.02e-27 kg. Correct.

I = μ R² =3.02e-27 * (2e-10)^2 = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m². Correct.

B = h²/(8 π² I) = (6.626e-34)^2/(8 π² * 1.208e-46) = (4.39e-67)/(9.529e-45) =4.6e-23 J. Correct.

So 2B =9.2e-23 J.

p=9.2e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 Ns. No options match.

Hmm. Maybe the question is expecting the photon to have the same momentum as the molecule's center of mass, but that's unrelated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is mixing up the mass or the bond length. Let me recheck the given data.

The problem says:

Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu.

Bond length R=2 angstroms.

Yes, 2 angstroms.

No mistakes found.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the moment of inertia using the non-reduced mass, but that's incorrect.

Wait, no, the moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule is definitely μ R².

Hmm.

At this point, I think I might have to choose the best possible option based on the calculations, even if it doesn't exactly match. Since the rotational transition's photon momentum isn't in the options, perhaps the intended answer is the vibrational transition's momentum, which is approximately 8.8e-28 Ns. But that's not an option.

Looking at the options again:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of hω.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Divided by 3e8 m/s: 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Wait, 8.83e-28 is approximately 8.8e-28, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is using ω in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1) instead of angular frequency.

Wait, angular frequency ω is related to wavenumber ν̃ by ω = c * ν̃ * 2π.

So if someone incorrectly uses ω as ν̃ (cm^-1) instead of the actual angular frequency, they might miscalculate.

But the question states that ω is the angular frequency, so that shouldn't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses the vibrational frequency in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1), but converted to angular frequency.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using wavenumbers.

Wavenumber ν̃ = ω/(2π c).

But the given ω is 4e14 rad/s, which is correct.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Given that, I'll have to conclude that the intended answer is option A, 1.9e-28 Ns, perhaps due to a miscalculation in the problem's setup.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer to be the vibrational transition, which would require 8.8e-28 Ns, but since that's not an option, perhaps the closest option is D, 1.4e-28.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of hω. Let me recheck.

h=6.626e-34, ω=4e14.

hω=6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Yes, correct.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended the momentum to be calculated using the energy of the vibrational transition, but with a different value for ω.

Wait, perhaps the given ω is in terms of wavenumbers, not angular frequency. For example, if someone used ω=4e14 cm^-1, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the given ω is in terms of the rotational constant B, but that doesn't make sense.

At this point, I think I'll have to settle with the initial calculation. The only possible conclusion is that the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Perhaps I made a mistake in the selection of the transition.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the molecule's transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which includes both a change in vibration and rotation, like (n=1, J=1). But the energy for that would be higher than both, which doesn't make sense for the 'next' state.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the photon to cause a transition to the first vibrational state with J=1, which would require 1.5 hω + 2B, but that's even higher.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent and the options available, I think the intended answer is option C: 1.1e-27 Ns. But wait, that's much larger than my calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy to be 2B, and I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, let me recheck B.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

I=1.208e-46 kg m².

B= h²/(8 π² I) = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 * π² *1.208e-46).

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67.

Denominator: 8 * π² * 1.208e-46 = 8 *9.8696 *1.208e-46.

8 *9.8696 ≈78.957.

78.957 *1.208e-46= 95.29e-46=9.529e-45.

So B=4.39e-67 /9.529e-45 =4.606e-23 J.

Yes, correct.

Hmm.

Perhaps the problem is expecting the photon's momentum for the transition to (n=1, J=0), which gives p=8.83e-28 Ns. Since none of the options match, I'm not sure.

But perhaps I'll have to pick option D, 1.4e-28 Ns, as the closest, but I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, where the molecule is initially in its fundamental state (n=0, J=0). The goal is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The given parameters are:

- Mass of atom X: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \)
- Mass of atom Y: \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
- Bond length: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
- Angular frequency of vibration: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reduced Mass Calculation**:  
   The reduced mass \( \mu \) is calculated as:  
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
   \]  
   Converting to kilograms:  
   \[
   \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
   \]

2. **Moment of Inertia**:  
   The moment of inertia \( I \) is:  
   \[
   I = \mu R^2 = (3.02 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2
   \]

3. **Rotational Constant \( B \)**:  
   The rotational constant \( B \) is given by:  
   \[
   B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I}
   \]  
   Substituting \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s} \) and \( I = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \):  
   \[
   B = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 (1.208 \times 10^{-46})} \approx 4.606 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]

4. **Energy Transitions**:  
   The molecule can transition to either:  
   - \( (n=0, J=1) \): Energy difference \( \Delta E = 2B \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \)  
   - \( (n=1, J=0) \): Energy difference \( \Delta E = h \omega \approx 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)

   Since \( 2B < h \omega \), the transition to \( (n=0, J=1) \) requires less energy.

5. **Photon Momentum for Rotational Transition**:  
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \). For the rotational transition:  
   \[
   p = \frac{2B}{c} = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}
   \]  
   This value is far smaller than any of the provided options.

6. **Photon Momentum for Vibrational Transition**:  
   For the vibrational transition to \( (n=1, J=0) \):  
   \[
   p = \frac{h \omega}{c} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (4 \times 10^{14})}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}
   \]  
   This value is also not directly matched by any option but is closer to option A (\( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \)) or D (\( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \)).

7. **Conclusion**:  
   The rotational transition requires less energy, but the calculated momentum (\( 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)) does not match any option. The vibrational transition momentum (\( 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)) is closer to option A or D, but neither matches exactly. Given the options, the most reasonable choice is **option D (\( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \))**, as it is the closest to the vibrational transition calculation.

ANSWER: D
