Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices given are combinations of these.

Wait, what do I remember about SMEFT? SMEFT is an effective field theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the Standard Model symmetries, right? So the operators in SMEFT must respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model itself.

In the Standard Model, the gauge symmetry is SU(2)_L × U(1)_Y. But what about other symmetries like Lorentz, Poincare, etc.?

Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if the theory respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz. But wait, SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory because the Standard Model is Lorentz invariant. So all operators must be Lorentz scalars. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.

What about Poincare symmetry (2)? Poincare includes translations, which is spacetime translations. So the theory must be invariant under translations, which would mean momentum is conserved, etc. Does SMEFT respect this? I think yes because it's a relativistic field theory. So operators must be Poincare invariant. But wait, what about the way SMEFT is constructed? I think SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, but does it necessarily have to respect Poincare symmetry? Because Poincare includes translations, and SMEFT is formulated as a Lorentz-invariant effective theory with a fixed scale (like the Planck scale), I think operators would also respect Poincare symmetry. So both 1 and 2 must be respected.

Wait, but wait a second. SMEFT is an effective theory, and effective theories are usually constructed as Lorentz-invariant. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are satisfied. So the operators must respect both 1 and 2.

Next, what about CP symmetry (3) and CPT symmetry (4)?

The Standard Model itself is not CP symmetric because of the CKM problem and other CP-violating phenomena. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP. Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. Oh, right, because SMEFT includes all possible operators as long as they are consistent with the SM gauge symmetries, but other symmetries like CP might not be preserved. So if the SM doesn't respect CP, then SMEFT operators don't have to either. Therefore, CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected by all operators.

Wait, but wait another thought. SMEFT is constructed as a low-energy effective theory, so in the absence of any explicit symmetry breaking, operators should respect the symmetries of the SM. But the SM doesn't have CP as a symmetry because of the CKM matrix and the Higgs potential (maybe). So in SMEFT, operators can have terms that violate CP, right? So the operators don't have to respect CP symmetry. So 3 is not a must.

What about CPT symmetry (4)? I remember that all Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories respect CPT symmetry. Because in any relativistic QFT, CPT is a symmetry. So SMEFT, being a Lorentz-invariant theory, must respect CPT. So 4 must be respected.

Putting it together: which symmetries must all operators respect?

1. Lorentz Symmetry → yes
2. Poincare symmetry → yes, because it's a subset of being a relativistic QFT. Or wait, does Poincare symmetry imply more than just Lorentz? Like, it includes translations. But SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so it must respect both Lorentz and Poincare. So 1 and 2 are both required.

Wait, wait. I think that Lorentz symmetry is a part of Poincare symmetry. So if a theory respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question is which must be respected. The options are 1, 2, etc. So if all operators must respect Poincare, then they must also respect Lorentz. So the question is, does SMEFT require Poincare symmetry? Or is it just Lorentz?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Because Poincare includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, but effective theories can have non-zero vacuum expectation values and such, but I think SMEFT is still Poincare-invariant. So the operators must be Poincare scalars, meaning they must be invariant under both Lorentz transformations and translations.

Wait, but operators in the SMEFT are built as Lorentz scalars, so they must respect Lorentz symmetry. But Poincare is a bigger symmetry. So if the operators are Poincare-invariant, they are automatically Lorentz-invariant. But in the SMEFT, are all operators Poincare-invariant? Because the theory as a whole is Poincare-invariant, yes. So each operator must be Poincare-invariant. So 2 is also a must.

So the correct symmetries that must be respected are 1 and 2.

Wait, but the options don't include only 1 and 2; option A is 1 and 2. But wait, the question says "must be respected by all operators in SMEFT." So 1 and 2 must be there.

But earlier I thought about CPT symmetry. So what about 4? Because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be CPT-invariant. So 4 must also be respected.

Wait, wait! Did I get that right? Because I thought that CPT is a symmetry in any Lorentz-invariant QFT. So if SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, then all operators must be CPT-invariant. So 4 must be respected. So in that case, the operators must respect 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, this is conflicting with my earlier analysis.

Let me clarify:

- Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations. So if operators must respect Poincare, they must respect both Lorentz and translations. But SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory, so 1 and 2 must both be respected.

- CPT symmetry is a combination of C, P, and T. But since the theory is Lorentz-invariant, CPT must hold. So all operators must respect CPT symmetry (4).

Wait, but what about the SM? The SM is CPT-invariant, so SMEFT, which is an effective theory of the SM, must also respect CPT symmetry in all its operators. So 4 must be respected.

So putting it all together, the operators must respect 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). But wait, 2 includes Lorentz, so 1 and 2 are both included in 2. Or maybe not exactly, but the way the options are presented, the question is about which are required.

Wait, the options are given as numbers. So which of the four options must be respected by all operators.

So the question lists the symmetries 1 to 4. The correct answer is that operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait. If 1 is Lorentz, 2 is Poincare, which includes 1. So the question is, are all operators in SMEFT required to respect both 1 and 2, or just 2?

Because if Poincare includes Lorentz, then requiring 2 automatically requires 1. So the options perhaps are about which symmetries are explicitly needed.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "must be respected by all operators in SMEFT". So the operators must be Poincare-invariant, which implies they are Lorentz-invariant. So the operators must have both 1 and 2. But in the options, 1 and 2 are both present in option A, but option C includes 1,2,4.

Wait, but I thought that CPT is automatically respected because the theory is Lorentz-invariant. So 4 must be respected as well. So the correct set would be 1,2,4.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again: if a theory is Lorentz-invariant, it must respect CPT symmetry. So if operators respect Lorentz symmetry, they automatically respect CPT symmetry. Or is that the other way around?

Wait, no. Wait, CPT symmetry is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. The CPT theorem states that in any relativistic quantum field theory, the combination of C, P, and T must be a symmetry. So if the theory is Lorentz-invariant, then CPT is a symmetry. So any operator in the theory must respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, 4 must be respected.

So the operators must respect 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). But wait, Poincare includes translations. So if the theory is Poincare-invariant, it is also Lorentz-invariant. So 1 is included in 2. So the required symmetries are 2 and 4. But looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4, and option A is 1 and 2. Hmm.

Wait, but Poincare is a larger symmetry than Lorentz. So if the operators are Poincare-invariant, they are automatically Lorentz-invariant. So if an operator respects Poincare, it's already respecting Lorentz. So the question is, which symmetries must be respected. So perhaps the correct answer is 1 and 2 and 4, because 4 is another symmetry beyond Lorentz.

Wait, but wait another angle: in SMEFT, the operators are required to be Lorentz scalars. So 1 is a must. Since the theory is Poincare-invariant, operators are built as Poincare scalars, so 2 is also a must. Since it's a relativistic theory, 4 must be respected as well.

So the correct symmetries are 1, 2, and 4. So looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4.

Wait, but let me check the options again:

Option C is 1,2,4. Option A is 1,2.

Wait, but earlier I thought that operators must respect Poincare, so that includes 2. So 1 is included in 2, but the question lists them as separate options. So in the options, the correct answer would include both 1 and 2, and 4.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering whether 2 is a subset of 1. But I don't think so. Poincare is a bigger symmetry than Lorentz. So all operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which implies they must respect Lorentz and translation symmetries.

So the correct answer would be that 1, 2, and 4 must be respected. So the correct option is C.

Wait, but another angle. In SMEFT, the operators are built as Lorentz scalars, so 1 is a must. But Poincare symmetry (2) is also a must because the theory is a Poincare-invariant effective theory. And because SMEFT is a relativistic theory, 4 (CPT) is also a must.

So the answer would include 1, 2, and 4. Which is option C.

Wait, but the options given are:

A) 1,2

B) 3,4

C) 1,2,4

D) 1,3,4

So option C is 1,2,4.

But wait, I think I may have made a mistake earlier. Because the question says, which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if an operator is Poincare-invariant, it is automatically Lorentz-invariant, so all operators must respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz. So 1 is included in 2. But the question lists 1 and 2 separately. So the correct option would include both 1 and 2, but since 2 implies 1, perhaps the correct answer is 2 (and 4), but it's not an option. Alternatively, the answer includes both 1 and 2, but I think that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm conflating the symmetries of the theory as a whole versus the operators. The SMEFT as a whole must respect Poincare symmetry. Therefore, all operators must be Poincare scalars, which means they must be Lorentz scalars and translation scalars. So both 1 and 2 are required.

Wait, but in reality, maybe the way operators are constructed in SMEFT, they are built as Lorentz scalars, which implies that 1 is a must, but whether the operators must be Poincare-invariant depends on the context. Or, perhaps, SMEFT is formulated in a way that allows for operators that are not Poincare-invariant. No, I don't think that's the case.

Wait, no. I think that in SMEFT, the operators are required to be Lorentz scalars, and because it's a relativistic QFT, it's Poincare-invariant. So the operators must be Poincare scalars. So both 1 and 2 are required.

So the operators must respect 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, but why is 4 included? Because CPT symmetry is required in any relativistic QFT, so yes, all operators must respect CPT symmetry.

So the correct answer is 1, 2, and 4. That's option C.

Wait, but looking back, perhaps I'm confusing the symmetries. The question is about the operators, not the theory as a whole. So each operator must be a scalar under the symmetry. For example, each operator must be a Lorentz scalar. Similarly, each operator must be a Poincare scalar, but wait, Poincare includes translations, which are spacetime translational invariance. So in a QFT, operators are typically not translation scalars because, for example, the field operators are not invariant under translation; you have to apply the translation to the fields, which would change their position. So maybe the operators are not required to be translation-invariant themselves, but the theory as a whole is translation-invariant, which is part of Poincare.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think again. In a QFT, the fields are not translation-invariant, but the theory as a whole is translation-invariant. So operators in the theory are not required to be translation scalars, but the theory's action is.

Wait, but SMEFT is an effective theory, and its operators are local, built from the SM fields, and each operator must be a Lorentz scalar. So they must respect Lorentz symmetry, but translation symmetry would imply that each operator is a scalar under spacetime translations, which is not the case because, for example, the operator ∂μ φ would transform under translation as φ(x) → φ(x + a) → ∂μ φ(x) would change under translation because of the derivative. So perhaps the operators don't have to be translation-invariant, but the sum of the operators in the Lagrangian must be translation-invariant.

Wait, but the question is about what each operator must respect. So each operator is a Lorentz scalar, so 1 is respected. But for Poincare symmetry, each operator is not necessarily translation-invariant, but the Lagrangian must be. So perhaps the operators themselves don't have to be Poincare scalars, only the sum in the Lagrangian is Poincare-invariant. So in that case, maybe 2 is not a requirement for each operator. Only Lorentz symmetry (1) is required for each operator.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Another approach: in SMEFT, all operators are constructed as Lorentz scalars. So they must respect Lorentz symmetry. But do they have to respect Poincare symmetry? Because Poincare symmetry for the operator would require that the operator is invariant under translations, which, as I said, is not the case because, for example, a derivative term would change under translation. Therefore, individual operators in the Lagrangian are not required to be translation-invariant. Instead, the entire Lagrangian must be translation-invariant. So each operator is a Lorentz scalar, but not necessarily a Poincare scalar. Thus, 2 is not a must for each operator, but the theory as a whole respects 2.

So in that case, the only symmetry each individual operator must respect is Lorentz (1), not Poincare (2). So 1 is correct, but 2 is not required for each operator to respect.

Hmm, this is getting more complicated. Another angle: Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz and translations. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so operators must be Lorentz scalars. But Poincare symmetry requires more than just Lorentz; it requires translation invariance. However, each operator in the Lagrangian can have a different transformation under translation, but the sum of all operators must be translation-invariant. So individual operators don't need to be translation-invariant, just their sum. Therefore, each operator doesn't have to respect Poincare symmetry (2), but all operators together must make the Lagrangian Poincare-invariant.

So for each operator, only Lorentz symmetry (1) is a must. Therefore, the answer would only include 1. But looking at the options, the options don't have an option with just 1.

Wait, no. The options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

The correct answer would be 1,2,4 if each operator must respect 2, but if each operator only needs to respect 1, then perhaps option A is incorrect.

But wait, in reality, can an operator in the Lagrangian violate Lorentz symmetry? No, because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so each operator must be a Lorentz scalar. But for Poincare, each operator doesn't have to be a Poincare scalar, but the Lagrangian must be. So the individual operators don't have to each respect 2, only the sum does. Therefore, the correct symmetries that each operator must respect are only 1 and 4 (CPT).

Wait, but no, because CPT is a combination of C, P, and T. If the theory is Lorentz-invariant, then the operators must be CPT-invariant. So 4 must be respected.

But wait, in the SM, not all operators are CPT-invariant. Wait, no, the SM is CPT-invariant because it's Lorentz-invariant. So any operator in the SM is CPT-invariant. So SMEFT, being an effective theory of the SM, must have all its operators be CPT-invariant. So 4 must be respected.

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think of it this way: The symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are those that are part of the SM's symmetries. The SM has gauge symmetry (SU(2), U(1)), Lorentz symmetry, and is CPT-invariant. The SM does not have CP symmetry, so operators can violate CP.

So, the operators in SMEFT must respect:

- Gauge symmetries (SU(2), U(1))

- Lorentz symmetry (so all operators must be Lorentz scalars)

- CPT symmetry (since the SM is Lorentz-invariant, so are its effective operators)

But do they need to respect Poincare? Well, the Lagrangian must be Poincare-invariant, but individual operators don't necessarily have to be, as their sum is Poincare-invariant. So perhaps each operator doesn't have to be Poincare-invariant, only the sum. So perhaps 2 is not a requirement for each operator.

But the question says, "must be respected by all operators in SMEFT." So if each operator must respect Poincare symmetry, then option A (1,2) would be correct. But if each operator doesn't have to, then only 1 and 4 are required.

Wait, perhaps I need to recall that in SMEFT, the operators are organized into a Lagrangian that is Poincare-invariant. Each operator in the Lagrangian is built as a Lorentz scalar, so 1 is a must. But Poincare includes translations; each operator is not required to be translation-invariant, but the entire Lagrangian must be. So each operator doesn't have to respect 2. Therefore, the correct symmetries each operator must respect are 1 and 4.

But the options don't have an option with 1 and 4. The options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So the only option that includes 1 and 4 is C, which also includes 2. But based on my analysis, 2 isn't a must for each operator. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Maybe the operators must be Poincare scalars. Because the operators are part of the effective Lagrangian, which is Poincare-invariant, so each operator must be built as a Poincare scalar. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar and a scalar under translations.

But wait, that's not possible because, for example, an operator involving a derivative ∂μ would not be translation-invariant. So perhaps the operators are not required to be translation-invariant, but the Lagrangian as a whole must be.

This is getting really confusing. Maybe I should look for a source or a reference. But since I can't do that, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 1,2,4. Because:

- Lorentz symmetry is required (1)

- Poincare symmetry is required (2), meaning each operator must be a Poincare scalar.

Wait, but as I said, an operator involving a derivative wouldn't be a Poincare scalar. So perhaps that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C (1,2,4), but I'm not fully confident.

Wait, another approach: in the SMEFT, the operators are built as higher-dimensional operators that are consistent with the SM symmetries. The SM includes Lorentz symmetry and gauge symmetry. So all SMEFT operators must be Lorentz scalars and gauge invariants. But beyond that, the SM doesn't enforce other symmetries like CP or CPT. However, the SM is CPT-invariant, so SMEFT operators must also be CPT-invariant. So 4 must be respected.

Wait, but wait. The SM is CPT-invariant, so any operator in the SMEFT must be CPT-invariant. So 4 must be respected.

As for Poincare symmetry, the operators are built as Lorentz scalars, and the theory is Poincare-invariant, so each operator must be a Poincare scalar. But that's not the case because, for example, a dimension-6 operator like (∂μ H)² would transform under translation as H(x) → H(x+a), so the operator would pick up terms from the derivatives. So perhaps individual operators don't have to be Poincare scalars, only the Lagrangian as a whole must be.

So each operator must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), and the overall Lagrangian must respect Poincare (2) and CPT (4). But the question is about what each operator must respect. So each operator must respect 1 and 4, but not necessarily 2.

But looking at the options, there's no option with just 1 and 4. So perhaps the correct answer is that operators must respect 1,2,4.

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about what each symmetry implies.

Lorentz symmetry (1): All operators must be Lorentz scalars. Must be respected.

Poincare symmetry (2): All operators must be Poincare scalars. But as discussed, this is not the case because individual operators aren't translation-invariant. So 2 is not a must for each operator.

CPT symmetry (4): Since the theory is Lorentz-invariant, each operator must be CPT-invariant. So 4 must be respected.

Thus, the correct symmetries are 1 and 4. But none of the options have only 1 and 4. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So none of the options include only 1 and 4. So perhaps I made a mistake in earlier reasoning.

Wait, perhaps SMEFT doesn't require individual operators to respect Poincare symmetry, but the theory as a whole does. So the question is about which symmetries are respected by all operators, which would be 1 and 4.

But again, the options don't include that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, including 1,2,4, because the theory respects all of them, but individual operators only have to respect 1 and 4, and 2 is a global symmetry.

I'm getting stuck. Let's think of another approach. Which symmetries are not necessarily respected by SMEFT operators? The SM doesn't have CP symmetry, so operators can violate CP, so 3 is not a must. So 3 is out.

So the correct answer must include 1 and 4, and possibly 2.

Wait, but in SMEFT, the operators are constructed as Lorentz scalars, so 1 is a must. Also, since the theory is a relativistic QFT, the operators must be CPT-invariant, so 4 is a must.

So the correct answer must include 1 and 4. But looking at the options, the only option that includes both 1 and 4 is option C (which has 1,2,4) and option D (1,3,4). But 3 is not a must, so D is out. So option C is the only one that includes 4.

But then, what about 2? If the operators don't have to be Poincare-invariant, then option C would be incorrect. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, which would be option C.

But I'm not entirely confident. I'm going to go with option C as the answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). SMEFT is an effective field theory that includes all higher-dimensional operators consistent with the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM). The SM is Lorentz-invariant and CPT-invariant but does not respect CP symmetry. SMEFT inherits these properties, and its operators must respect the same symmetries as the SM.

### Analysis of the Symmetries:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry (1):**  
   SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, meaning all operators must be Lorentz scalars. This is a fundamental requirement for any relativistic field theory, and SMEFT explicitly enforces this. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry (2):**  
   Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and spacetime translations. While the SMEFT Lagrangian as a whole must be Poincaré-invariant, individual operators do not necessarily have to be translation-invariant. For example, operators involving derivatives (∂μ) are not translation-invariant. Thus, while the theory respects Poincaré symmetry, it is not a requirement for each operator to individually respect it. This makes Poincaré symmetry less relevant at the operator level.

3. **CP Symmetry (3):**  
   The SM does not respect CP symmetry due to phenomena like the CKM phase and the Higgs potential. Since SMEFT includes all possible operators consistent with SM symmetries, operators in SMEFT can violate CP symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry (4):**  
   Any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, including SMEFT, must respect CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, all operators must also respect CPT symmetry.

### Conclusion:
The operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry (1) and CPT symmetry (4). While Poincaré symmetry (2) is a property of the theory as a whole, individual operators are not required to respect it. CP symmetry (3) is explicitly not respected by all operators in SMEFT. Therefore, the correct answer is **1 and 4**, but since the options do not include this combination, the closest correct option is **C (1, 2, 4)**, assuming Poincaré symmetry is interpreted as being implicitly required for the operators.
