Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's take it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400-2500 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates an O-H stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid because those are broad and can be in that region. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, again pointing towards a carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ peaks are probably aromatic C=C stretches.

Now the NMR data. Let me parse through that. The 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) is a strong signal, which matches the proton of a carboxylic acid. The broad singlet suggests that it's not split because there's no adjacent H, but the broadness could be due to hydrogen bonding, typical of carboxylic acids. Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) are aromatic protons. The downfield shift at 8.0 suggests substitution, possibly para-substituted. The two doublets mean two sets of two equivalent protons each. So maybe a benzene ring with two substituents, perhaps para to each other.

Looking at the rest of the NMR: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH next to an electronegative group, like adjacent to a carbonyl. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl or another electronegative group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet (but wait, it says d, so maybe it's a doublet?) Wait, no, the integration is 3H as a doublet. Hmm, maybe it's a methyl group attached to something else. And 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, like part of an ethyl chain. 

Putting this together, the structure seems to have a benzene ring with substituents. Since there are two doublets in the aromatic region, maybe it's a para-substituted ring. One substituent is a carbonyl group (from the IR and the 10.5 ppm proton), so perhaps a benzoic acid. Then, the other substituent is an ethyl group or something similar, given the NMR signals.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm doublet for 3H suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2. And the 1.7 ppm multiplet for 2H might be CH2 connected to another CH. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group attached to the carbonyl. So maybe the structure is something like a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and an ethyl substituent, but more specifically, perhaps a (4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid?

Looking at the options, option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Wait, that would be a propanoic acid where the phenyl is attached to the second carbon. Alternatively, if it's a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid and an ethyl group in the para position, then the structure would be 4-ethylbenzoic acid. But looking at the NMR, there's a CH2 group and a CH group. Let me think again.

Wait, the NMR shows a 1H at 2.9 ppm. That might be a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. Or perhaps a CH next to an oxygen. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH attached to a carbonyl. Let me try to draw this out.

If the structure is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at position 4 and an ethyl group... Wait, the substituents are at positions 4 and something else. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a carboxylic acid and an isobutyl group.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzoic acid has a sec-butyl group attached at the para position. Let's think about the NMR. For a sec-butyl group, the structure would be CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no. Sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3) connected where?

Wait, wait. The sec-butyl group is (CH2)2CHCH2-? No. Wait, no. Sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the structure might be:

Benzoic acid with a substituent on the benzene ring. Let's see the NMR.

The 10.5 ppm is the COOH proton. The aromatic protons are two doublets, 2H each, which suggests a para-substituted benzene. So, the substituents are at para positions, meaning the ring has two groups opposite each other.

One substituent is COOH, and the other is perhaps an ethyl group or a branched group.

Looking at the NMR signals again. The 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (maybe a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2, or a CH group). The 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, and 0.9 ppm is a triplet for 3H. That suggests a -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 structure, but perhaps not. Alternatively, it could be a branching point.

Wait, let's think about the substituents. The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a terminal CH2CH2 group. So maybe the other substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, which is a sec-butyl group. Because a sec-butyl would have a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3). Let me break that down. The central CH would have two CH2 groups attached. Wait, perhaps it's (CH2)2CHCH3. No, wait, no. Wait, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that's not right. Let me think again. Butyl groups: n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH2-, iso-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)2, and sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. So the structure would be:

Ph-COOH and Ph-CH2CH(CH2CH3)-?

Wait, but in that case, the NMR would have signals from the CH2 and the CH groups.

So the substituent on the benzene is a sec-butyl group. The NMR for the substituent would be:

The CH2 next to the ring (let's say it's the CH2 in CH2-CH(CH2CH3)), so that CH2 would be around 1.7 ppm (maybe as a multiplet, integrating to 2H). The CH group adjacent to that (which is connected to the CH2CH3) would be around 2.9 ppm as a multiplet (the 1H). The CH2CH3 would be at 1.4 ppm as a triplet (but wait, the CH2CH3 is attached to a CH, so maybe a doublet? Or perhaps it's a septet? Hmm, not sure. Wait, the NMR shows 1.4 ppm as a doublet for 3H and 0.9 ppm as a triplet for 3H. That suggests that the CH2CH3 is at the end, so perhaps the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, but that would make the CH2 adjacent to the CH be split into a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-COOH and Ph-CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, because the substituent would be in the para position.

Wait, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then the structure is Ph-COOH and Ph-CH2CH(CH2CH3). Let me think about the NMR shifts. The CH2 next to the benzene (let's say it's the CH2 in the sec-butyl) would be around 2.5-3 ppm. The CH in the middle would be around 2.9 ppm. The CH2CH3 would be at 1.4 ppm as a doublet (since it's attached to the CH), and the terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm as a triplet.

Wait, but in the given NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H) and 0.9 is a triplet (3H). So that fits a CH2CH3 group attached to a CH. So the substituent structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So that's a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring.

So if the substituents are COOH and a sec-butyl group at para positions, the structure would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

Now, the reaction part. The compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. But wait, wait. Wait, in this case, if the compound is a carboxylic acid, then what? Clemmensen reduces ketones. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, another thought: when a carboxylic acid is treated with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of deprotonation or substitution. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is related to the formation of an acid chloride or something else.

Wait, no, wait. Think again: the reaction is X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. What's X? X is a carboxylic acid. So, what happens when a carboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction is the reduction of a carbonyl group. But carboxylic acids don't have a carbonyl that can be reduced under Clemmensen conditions because they're more oxidized than ketones. Clemmensen requires acidic alpha hydrogens, but carboxylic acids have alpha hydrogens (the -COOH has an alpha hydrogen only if there's a CH2 group attached, which in this case, if the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then the benzoic acid is attached directly to the ring. So the carbonyl can't be reduced because it's a COOH group, which is more resistant to such reductions.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction isn't a Clemmensen. Maybe it's a different type of reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I've misidentified the structure.

Wait, what if X is a benzophenone derivative? No, because the IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ which is more like a ketone, but wait, the 10.5 ppm suggests a carboxylic acid OH.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester. Because esters have a carbonyl around 1700s. Wait, but the IR at 1720 is a bit higher than the typical ester carbonyl. So maybe a ketone. But then where is the O-H?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me re-examine the IR. The IR peaks: 3400–2500 cm-1 is a broad peak, which could be an O-H stretch, but maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. The 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. If it were an ester, the O-H might not be present, but maybe it's a ketone. But then the broad peak in IR could be due to an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an aromatic ester, like a methyl benzoate or similar. Let's reevaluate the NMR.

If the compound is benzoic acid, then the O-H would be around 10-12 ppm, which matches the 10.5 ppm signal, and the broadness suggests it's a carboxylic acid.

So red phosphorus and HI reacting with a carboxylic acid. Oh wait, I think when a carboxylic acid is treated with HX (like HI), in presence of a reducing agent like red phosphorus, it can lead to the formation of an alkane. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Another possibility: perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carboxylic acid to an alkane. But that would require removing oxygen. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the carboxylic acid is converted to an acid chloride, but I don't think HI alone with red phosphorus does that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is about removing the oxygen, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a benzoin condensation, but that's with HCN and KCN, I think. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrogenation, but red phosphorus and HI is more about reducing.

Wait, another thought: maybe X is a benzaldehyde derivative, but the IR doesn't fit that. The NMR doesn't show a peak around 9-10 ppm for an aldehyde proton.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group, and the NMR is showing a propyl group attached. Let me think about substituents again.

If the structure is 4-ethylbenzoic acid, then the substituent is an ethyl group. The NMR would have a triplet at 1.4 ppm (if the ethyl is CH2CH2), but wait, that's not matching the data given. The given NMR has a 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) and 0.9 ppm triplet (3H). So that suggests a longer chain, perhaps a propyl or butyl group.

Wait, 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) suggests a -CH(CH2CH3) group. Because the CH would be split into a doublet (due to the adjacent CH2CH3), and the CH2CH3 would be a triplet due to the adjacent CH.

Wait, so the substituent could be a isopropyl group? No, because isopropyl would be (CH3)2CH-. Then the NMR would show a septet for the CH2 groups, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group. But the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) might fit a CH2 group adjacent to a CH.

Hmm, maybe it's a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

Then, when this reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens? Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. But in this case, the compound is a carboxylic acid. Wait, but perhaps the reaction isn't a Clemmensen. Alternatively, maybe the carboxylic acid is converted into an acid chloride, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is converting the carboxylic acid into an alkane. I remember that when a carboxylic acid is treated with H2, Pd catalyst, it can be reduced to a methylene group. But that's a hydrogenation reaction, not Clemmensen. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a form of deoxygenation.

Wait, if the starting material is a benzoic acid derivative, and it's treated with HI and red phosphorus, which is a strong reducing agent, perhaps the carboxylic acid is reduced to a methyl group. For example, RCOOH → RCH2OH (if reduced to alcohol) or RCH3 (if further reduction). But I'm not entirely certain about the exact pathway.

Wait, in the Clemmensen reduction, ketones are reduced to alkanes. So if the starting material is a ketone, X would be the ketone, and the product would be an alkane. But in this case, the starting material is a carboxylic acid, so perhaps the reaction isn't a Clemmensen but something else.

Alternatively, if the compound is an ester, maybe it's converted to an alcohol. But the initial analysis suggests it's a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: look at the options. The options are A to D. Let's see what each option is.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So the phenyl is attached to the second carbon of a propanoic acid.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with isobutyl and methyl substituents.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl substituent.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl and a methyl group.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Let's think about the products.

If the starting material is option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid), and the reagent is red phosphorus and HI. Maybe the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an -O- group or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the -COOH is deprotonated and then undergoes some reaction.

Wait, but I'm not recalling the exact reaction of carboxylic acids with red phosphorus and HI. Maybe it's not a substitution but a reduction. Wait, maybe the COOH is reduced to a CH2OH group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is adding HI in presence of a reducing agent, leading to the formation of a Grignard-like reagent, but that's a stretch.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by -I. But why would that happen? Maybe the carboxylic acid is first activated, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI could be used in the Birch reduction, but Birch is for aromatic rings, typically adding H.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a deoxygenation. So, if the starting material is a benzoic acid (R-COOH), the reaction could reduce it to R-CH3. For example, using a strong reducing agent to remove the oxygen.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, it would become 4-(sec-butyl)toluene (i.e., 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a methyl group where the COOH was). But wait, that doesn't match any option exactly.

Wait, the options don't have a product where COOH is converted to CH3. Let me look again.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That would be a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in the para positions.

Wait, if the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the COOH is reduced to a CH3 group, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene. But the product would have two substituents: the sec-butyl and the methyl. So the benzene would have a methyl at position 4 and a sec-butyl at position 4? No, that can't be right. Wait, the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, meaning the COOH is at position 1 and the sec-butyl at position 4. So when reduced, the COOH becomes a CH3 at position 1, and the substituent remains at position 4 as sec-butyl. So the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)-toluene, which is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Because in benzene, the positions are relative. So that matches option D.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused with the numbering. Let's imagine the benzene ring is numbered such that the COOH is at position 1, and the substituent is at position 4. When COOH is reduced to CH3 (at position 1), the substituent remains at position 4 as sec-butyl. So the product would have a methyl at position 1 and a sec-butyl at position 4. So the structure would be 4-(sec-butyl)-1-methylbenzene. But in the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which would have the substituents at positions 1 (sec-butyl) and 4 (methyl). That's the same as our product if the numbering is switched because benzene is symmetric.

Wait, no, because when you reduce the COOH group, it becomes a methyl in the same position as the COOH was. So if the COOH was at position 1, the methyl would be at position 1. The substituent was at position 4, so it's now 4-(sec-butyl) and 1-methyl. So the product would be 1-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene. Looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is the same as 4-methyl-1-(sec-butyl)benzene. Which is the same as our product, just the substituents are swapped in naming, but chemically they are the same.

So, the product would be option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the starting material is option C. So when C reacts, it produces D. Therefore, the correct answer is D.

But wait, let me double-check. The reaction converts the COOH group to CH3. So, in the starting material, the substituents are COOH (position 1) and sec-butyl (position 4). After reduction, the COOH becomes CH3 (position 1), and the substituent remains at position 4 as sec-butyl. So the product would have substituents at 1 and 4: methyl and sec-butyl. So the correct name would be 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is option D.

So, the correct answer is D.

The problem involves identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data and determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Here's the analysis:

### Step 1: Analyze the IR and NMR Data
- **IR Data**:
  - Peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ suggest an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
  - A strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid.
  - Peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ suggest aromatic C=C bonds.

- **NMR Data**:
  - **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of the proton in a carboxylic acid.
  - **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring.
  - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet likely corresponding to a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl.
  - **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet for a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl or another electronegative group.
  - **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet for a methyl group attached to a CH.
  - **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet for a terminal methyl group, suggesting an alkyl chain.

### Step 2: Identify the Structure of Compound X
The IR and NMR data indicate a para-substituted benzoic acid with a substituent containing a sec-butyl group. The substituent structure matches **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**:
- The **10.5 ppm** peak corresponds to the carboxylic acid proton.
- The **8.0 ppm** and **7.2 ppm** peaks correspond to the aromatic protons of a para-substituted benzene ring.
- The **2.9 ppm**, **1.7 ppm**, **1.4 ppm**, and **0.9 ppm** peaks correspond to the CH, CH2, and CH3 groups in the sec-butyl substituent.

Thus, the structure of Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid** (Option C).

### Step 3: Determine the Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. However, in this case, the starting material is a carboxylic acid. The reaction reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH3), while leaving the sec-butyl substituent intact. This results in the product **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.

### Step 4: Match the Product with the Options
The product **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** corresponds to **Option D**.

### Final Answer
The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**, which matches **Option D**.

Answer: D
