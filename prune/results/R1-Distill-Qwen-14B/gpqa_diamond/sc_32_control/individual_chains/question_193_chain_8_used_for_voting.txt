Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the number of stars (N) is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance (r). The options are A to D, with various powers of r.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in the position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So, distance r = 1/plx. Oh wait, actually, parallax plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs. So plx is inversely proportional to distance.

Wait, but how does the number of stars depend on distance here? The given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/r, I can substitute that into the equation.

Let me write this down: plx = 1/r, so 1/plx = r. So 1/plx^5 would be (1/plx)^5, which is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So as the distance increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of r. Wait, but the question is about how the number changes with distance. Wait, no, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of distance. Oh, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I need to think about how the number of stars in a shell at distance r depends on r. Because when we observe the sky, stars at different distances form spherical shells. The number of stars in a shell at distance r with thickness dr would depend on the volume of that shell and the density of stars in that region.

Wait, but the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is r^5. So if I'm considering a thin shell between r and r+dr, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to r^5 multiplied by the volume of the shell. Because the volume of a thin shell is 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in the shell would be N_shell = k * r^5 * 4π r² dr, where k is some constant.

Wait, but wait, in the given scenario, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, which is r^5. So perhaps the number density (stars per unit volume) is proportional to r^5? That might be. So if the number density is n(r) = C * r^5, then the number of stars in a spherical shell would be n(r) * volume of the shell.

The volume of a thin shell is 4πr² dr, so N_shell = (C r^5) * (4π r² dr) ) = C * 4π * r^7 dr. So the number of stars per unit distance (dr) would be proportional to r^7. But wait, none of the options match that. Hmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, let me go back. The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx =1/r, that's N ∝ r^5. So for a given distance, the number of stars is proportional to r^5. So as the distance increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. But how does the number change per unit distance? Wait, the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Wait, maybe it's the surface density. No, wait, when you look at the sky, the number of stars you observe at a certain distance depends on the volume up to that distance. Because stars are three-dimensional. So the total number of stars up to distance r would be the integral of the number density from 0 to r.

Wait, but the question is about how the number changes per unit range, so it's the derivative of N with respect to r. Because per unit distance, it's like the rate of change.

Wait, let me model this. Let’s say the number of stars in a thin shell at radius r is N(r) dr, where N(r) is the number per unit volume. Then, the total number of stars up to radius r is the integral from 0 to r of N(r') * 4π r'^2 dr'. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So if I have a thin shell at radius r, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to r^5 multiplied by the volume of the shell (4π r² dr). So N_shell = k r^5 * 4π r² dr = 4π k r^7 dr. So the number per unit distance (dr) is proportional to r^7. But that's not an option either.

Wait, but perhaps the question is simpler. It says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/plx^5, which is r^5. So as the distance increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. So if r doubles, the number of stars increases by a factor of 32. But the question is about how the number changes per unit distance. Hmm. That suggests that the rate of change of N with respect to r is dN/dr, which would be the derivative of (r^5), which is 5 r^4. So the change per unit distance is proportional to r^4. So that would match option C, which is ~ r^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the question says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5". So how is the number of stars related to the parallax? Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if a star's parallax is smaller, it's farther away. So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, then N increases as plx decreases, which is as r increases.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes per unit distance, so per unit increase in r, the number of stars increases by how much.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of differential. If N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr is 5 r^4, so the change in number per unit distance is proportional to r^4. So that would mean the correct answer is C, which is ~ r^4.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^5, and since plx is 1/r, then N = C (r^5), so when r increases by dr, the change in N is C * 5 r^4 dr. So the change per unit distance is 5 C r^4. So the number increases as r^4 per unit distance.

Looking at the options, option C is ~ r^4. So the answer should be C.

The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), we can substitute \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \) into the equation, giving \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the total number of stars increases with distance as \( r^5 \).

To determine how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance (\( r \)), we consider the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \). Since \( N \propto r^5 \), the derivative is:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4.
\]

This shows that the rate of change of the number of stars with distance is proportional to \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is \( \sim r^4 \), which corresponds to option C.
