Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. They mention that when one hemisphere is spotty, the brightness variations observed as the star rotates look similar to those caused by an exoplanet. The question is asking what the radius of a planet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation as these spots, assuming the star wasn't spotted otherwise.

Hmm. So I think the idea is that both the spots and the planet cause dips in brightness when they pass in front of the star from our point of view. But in this case, the spots cause a dip because they're cooler and thus emit less light. The planet would cause a dip when it transits the star. We need to compare the two effects.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the photometric observations would reveal periodic variations due to rotation, but it's compared to an exoplanet. So, perhaps the star's spots modulate the brightness as it rotates, causing a dip each time the spotted area comes into view. The planet would cause a dip when it transits, but since the planet's orbital period would match the star's rotation period for this to be periodic, maybe.

But the question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation. So we need to find the planet radius (Rpl) relative to the star's radius (Rstar) such that the dip in brightness (due to the planet) is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

First, let me think about the brightness variation caused by the spots.

The star's total brightness when unspotted would be based on its entire surface emitting at 6000 K. But the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere, so perhaps 20% of half the star's surface. Wait, no, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the entire star's surface is 4π R². One hemisphere is 2π R². The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, so 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, but the star's surface emits with a certain flux. The spots are cooler, so they contribute less. The total flux from the star would be the sum of the flux from the spotted regions and the unspotted regions.

The star's effective temperature is Teff = 6000 K. The spots have a temperature of 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K.

The flux from a blackbody is proportional to T^4. So the unspotted area emits at (6000)^4, and the spotted area at (5000)^4.

The total flux when the spots are facing us (i.e., the spotted hemisphere is visible) would be:

Flux = (1 - f) * (Teff)^4 * (π R²) + f * (T_spot)^4 * (π R²) 

Wait, no. Wait, the filling factor f is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So maybe:

The star has a radius R = R_sun. The total surface area is 4π R². One hemisphere is 2π R². The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, so 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So when the spots are on the side facing us, the star's light comes from the unspotted part of that hemisphere and the spotted part. The other hemisphere is entirely unspotted.

So the total flux when the spots are visible (as the star rotates) would be:

Flux_spotted = (unspotted area on this hemisphere * Teff^4 + spotted area on this hemisphere * T_spot^4) + (entire other hemisphere * Teff^4)

Wait, no. The star's total flux is the sum of all the areas on the star's surface. If the entire star is at Teff except for the spots, then:

Flux = (Area_unspotted * Teff^4) + (Area_spotted * T_spot^4)

But wait, the star's radius is R. The total area is 4π R². The unspotted area is 4π R² minus the area of the spots. Alternatively, the spots are 20% of one hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the average flux from the star when the spots are facing us and when they're not.

Wait, when the star is rotating, the spots come into view and go out of view. The maximum flux is when the spots are on the far side, so the entire star is emitting at Teff. The minimum flux is when the spots are on the near side, so part of the hemisphere is at lower temperature.

Wait, but the calculation is about the difference in brightness between when the spots are visible and when they're not. The amplitude (delta F) would be the difference between the maximum and minimum flux.

Alternatively, the change in brightness (the dip) when the spots are on the near side would be the difference between the maximum flux (all spots hidden, so the star emits at full) and the minimum flux (spots visible).

Wait, no. When the star is rotating, the spots come into view. So when part of the star's surface is cooler, the total flux would be less than the maximum. So the dip would be the difference between the maximum flux (no spots visible) and the flux when the spots are visible.

So, the maximum flux is when all spots are on the far side: F_max = (4π R²) * (σ Teff^4).

The flux when the spots are on the near side (F_min) is:

F_min = (4π R² - Area_spots) * (σ Teff^4) + Area_spots * (σ T_spot^4)

So the amplitude of the variation is (F_max - F_min) = (Area_spots) * [Teff^4 - T_spot^4] * σ.

Wait, but wait. The area of the spots is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R². Because a hemisphere is 2π R², and 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the area of the spots is 0.4 π R².

So the dip ΔF is F_max - F_min = (F_max) - [F_max - Area_spots * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) * σ ]

= Area_spots * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) * σ

So the relative dip is (ΔF) / F_max = [Area_spots * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)] / (4π R² * Teff^4)

Simplify that:

Relative dip = (0.4 π R² / 4π R²) ) * ( (6000^4 - 5000^4) / 6000^4 )

The 0.4 is from 0.2 * 2 (hemisphere). So 0.4 π R².

So 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.4 / 4 = 0.1.

So relative dip = 0.1 * ( (6000^4 -5000^4) / 6000^4 )

Calculate (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4.

6000^4 is (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12.

5000^4 = 5^4 * 1e12 = 625e12.

So 1296e12 -625e12 = 671e12.

Divide by 1296e12: 671 / 1296 ≈ 0.5177.

So relative dip ≈ 0.1 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.05177, or about 5.177%.

Wait, that's the dip caused by the spots. So the star's brightness varies by about 5.177% due to the spots.

Now, the planet would cause a dip when it transits. The dip would be (Area of planet / Area of star). Because the planet blocks some light.

The area ratio is (π R_p^2 ) / (π R_star^2 ) = (R_p / R_star )^2.

So the dip is (R_p / R_star )^2.

We need this dip to be equal to the spot-induced dip, which is approximately 5.177% or 0.05177.

So (R_p / R_star )^2 = 0.05177.

Take square root: R_p/R_star = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, that's about 0.23. But looking at the options, the closest is option D) 0.32. Hmm. Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation somewhere.

Wait, let me recheck the numbers.

First, the area of the spots is 20% of the hemisphere.

So hemisphere area is 2π R². 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Maximum flux F_max = 4 π R² * (6000^4 sigma).

F_min = (4 π R² - 0.4 pi R² ) * 6000^4 sigma + 0.4 pi R^2 * 5000^4 sigma.

So F_min = [3.6 pi R^2 * 6000^4 ] + [ 0.4 pi R² * 5000^4 ].

F_max is 4 pi R² * 6000^4.

So F_max - F_min = (4 pi R^2 * 6000^4) - [3.6 pi R^2 *6000^4 + 0.4 pi R^2 *5000^4 ]

= (4 -3.6) pi R² 6000^4 - 0.4 pi R² 5000^4

= 0.4 pi R^2 6000^4 - 0.4 pi R^2 5000^4

= 0.4 pi R^2 (6000^4 -5000^4 )

So the dip is 0.4 pi R^2 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) * sigma.

The relative dip is dip / F_max.

F_max is 4 pi R^2 sigma 6000^4.

So (0.4 pi R^2 [6000^4 -5000^4 ] sigma ) / (4 pi R^2 sigma 6000^4 )

= (0.4 /4 ) * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) /6000^4

0.4/4 = 0.1.

So 0.1 * (6000^4 -5000^4 )/6000^4.

Compute that.

Compute (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4 = 1 - (5000/6000)^4.

5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.833333.

(0.833333)^4.

What's 0.8333 cubed? 0.8333^2 = 0.6944, then *0.8333 ≈ 0.5833. Then *0.8333 again ≈ 0.4861.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 ≈ 0.517747.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.0517747 → ~5.177%.

So the dip is about 5.177% due to the spots.

Now, the planet's dip is (R_p/R_star)^2.

Set that equal to 0.0517747.

So R_p/R_star = sqrt(0.0517747) ≈ 0.2275.

Which is approximately 0.23.

Looking at the options:

A) ~0.39 → 0.39² is about 0.15, which is higher than 0.05.

B) ~0.07 → 0.07² is 0.0049, much lower.

C) ~0.11 → 0.11² is 0.0121, still lower.

D) ~0.32 → 0.32² is 0.1024, which is bigger than 0.05.

Wait, but none of these options are about 0.23. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again.

Wait, the problem says "the star has a radius equal to the Sun". So Rstar is R_sun.

But the problem is about the relative radius of the planet compared to the star. So Rpl/Rstar is the fraction.

Wait, but the calculation I did gives Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2275, which is about 0.23. But none of the options match that. The options are A:0.39, B:0.07, C:0.11, D:0.32.

Hmm. So maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach isn't correct. Let me think again.

Wait, another thought: the star's brightness dip due to the spots is when the spots are on the near side, so the star's apparent brightness decreases. Similarly, when the planet transits, the brightness also decreases. So the dip amplitude is the same in both cases.

So for the star, the dip is (F_max - F_min)/F_max.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the dip as a percentage change.

Wait, let me recalculate the relative dip.

Compute (6000^4 -5000^4) / 6000^4.

Let me compute 6000^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12.

5000^4 = 5^4 * 1e12 = 625e12.

So (6000^4 -5000^4) = 671e12.

So (671e12) / (1296e12) = 671/1296 ≈ 0.5177.

Multiply by 0.4 (from the spots, 0.4 pi R² area), so 0.4 * 0.5177 = 0.2071.

Wait, but wait: The spots' area is 0.4 pi R². So the fraction of the star's surface that is spots is (0.4 pi R²) / (4 pi R²) ) = 0.4/4 = 0.1, which is 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I had (0.4 pi R² ) / (4 pi R²) = 0.1, multiplied by (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4 = 0.5177, giving 0.05177.

Wait, but perhaps the correct approach is to compute the fractional change in flux.

The star's flux when the spots are visible is F = F_unspotted * (1 - f) + F_spotted * f.

Wait, F_unspotted is the flux per unit area at Teff, and F_spotted is the flux per unit area at T_spot.

The total flux without any spots would be F_unspotted_total = F_unspotted * 4 pi R².

When the spots are present, F_spotted_total = F_unspotted * (4 pi R² - A_spots) + F_spotted * A_spots.

So the relative change is:

(F_unspotted_total - F_spotted_total) / F_unspotted_total 

= [ F_unspotted * (A_unspotted) + F_spotted * A_spots - F_unspotted * (A_unspotted + A_spots) ) ] / F_unspotted_total 

= [ F_spotted * A_spots - F_unspotted * A_spots ] / F_unspotted_total 

= A_spots (F_spotted - F_unspotted) / (F_unspotted * 4 pi R² )

But F_spotted = sigma T_spot^4, F_unspotted = sigma T_unspotted^4.

So the expression becomes:

A_spots (T_spot^4 - T_unspotted^4) * sigma / (sigma T_unspotted^4 * 4 pi R^2 )

= [ A_spots (T_spot^4 - T_unspotted^4) ] / (4 pi R² T_unspotted^4 )

Which is the same as before.

So the relative dip is (0.4 pi R²/4 pi R² ) * ( (6000^4 -5000^4 ) /6000^4 )

Which is 0.1 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.05177, so about 5.177%.

Wait, but that's the same as before. So the planet's dip, which is (R_p/Rs)^2, should equal 0.05177.

So R_p/Rs = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

But looking at the options, the choices are A:0.39, B:0.07, C:0.11, D:0.32.

Hmm, but none are 0.23. Did I make a mistake in the calculation of the spots' effect?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the spots are only on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view for half the rotation period. But when the spots are on the far side, the star's flux is maximum. When the spots face us, the flux decreases.

But when the planet transits, it's only during a specific time, and the dip is a sharp decrease. But the rotational modulation has a smoother variation, perhaps.

Wait, but the problem states that the brightness variation due to the spots is periodic and resembles that of a planet. So the amplitude of the variation is what's important.

Wait, but maybe the approach is different. Maybe the spot-induced dip is not 5%, but less. Let me think again.

Wait, wait. The calculation I did for the relative dip is correct, right? Because the spots are cooler, so when they're on the near side, the star's flux decreases by a certain amount. The dip is about 5.177%.

But the options don't have anything close to 0.23. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, only a fraction of the spots are visible. Wait, no, when the hemisphere is facing us, all the spots are visible. When it's not, the spots are on the far side and don't contribute to the dip.

Wait, but the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So when the spots are on the near side, the area is 0.2 * (2 pi R²) = 0.4 pi R².

Hmm, perhaps an alternative approach is needed. Maybe the star's flux is being considered as the sum of all the spots and unspotted regions.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the effective temperature of the star with spots, but that might not directly help.

Alternative approach: when the planet transits, the dip is proportional to (R_p/Rs)^2. For the spots, the dip is proportional to (f * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ) / Teff^4.

Wait, where f is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots.

Wait, f is 20% of one hemisphere, so 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1. So 10% of the star's surface is spotted.

So the dip is f * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)/Teff^4.

Which is 0.1 * (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4.

Which is 0.1 * 0.5177 = 0.05177, same as before.

So the dip for the planet would be (R_p/Rs)^2 = 0.05177.

So R_p/Rs = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275, so about 0.23.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the planet is causing an eclipse, but the spots are causing a variation that's a dip and then a recovery. So perhaps the maximum dip is when the spots are on the near side, and the planet's dip is when it's in front. But perhaps the planet's dip is higher because it's a larger area.

Wait, but the problem says that the observed variation is the same amplitude as an exoplanet. So the dip due to the planet must be as big as the dip due to the spots.

Hmm. Let me double-check the numbers. 6000 K, spots 5000 K.

Compute (6000/5000)^4.

6000/5000 = 1.2.

1.2^4 = (1.44)^2 = 2.0736.

So (6000^4)/(5000^4) = 2.0736.

So (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4 = 1 - (1/2.0736) = 1 - 0.482253 ≈ 0.5177.

Multiply by 0.1 (from 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1) gives 0.05177.

So the dip is 5.177%.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the planet's radius as the same as the spot's effect, which is 5.177% dip. But again, my calculation gives a planet radius of about 0.23 times the star's radius.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the spot's effect. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the star's radius is Rs, and the planet's radius is Rp. When the planet transits, the area blocked is π Rp². The star's area is π Rs². So the dip is (Rp/Rs)^2.

But for the spots, the dip is 0.05177, which is (R_p/Rs)^2 = 0.05177 → R_p/Rs ≈ 0.2275.

But the available options don't include this. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the rotational effect, meaning that the spots cover only a certain portion of the star's surface as seen from Earth. For instance, perhaps the observer sees only a part of the spots due to the star's rotation.

Wait, no, the problem states that one hemisphere is covered with spots. So when the star rotates, that hemisphere comes into view, causing the dip.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the brightness variation's amplitude in terms of the star's flux.

Wait, another approach: the flux from the star without any spots is F0 = 4π R^2 * sigma * Teff^4.

When the spots are visible, the flux is F = (4π R^2 - A_spots) * sigma Teff^4 + A_spots * sigma T_spot^4.

So the change in flux is delta_F = F0 - F.

Which is:

delta_F = [4π R^2 sigma Teff^4] - [ (4π R^2 - A_spots) sigma Teff^4 + A_spots sigma T_spot^4 ]

= 4pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 -4pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 + A_spots sigma Teff^4 - A_spots sigma T_spot^4.

= A_spots sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

So the relative change is delta_F / F0.

= [ A_spots sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / (4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 )

= [ A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / (4 pi R^2 Teff^4 )

= [ (0.2 * 2 pi R^2 ) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / (4 pi R^2 Teff^4 )

Because the area of the spots is 0.2 * hemisphere, and hemisphere is 2 pi R^2.

So 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R^2.

So:

= [0.4 pi R^2 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / (4 pi R^2 Teff^4 )

= (0.4 /4 ) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4

= 0.1 * ( (6000^4 -5000^4 ) /6000^4 )

Which brings me back to the same 0.05177 dip.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm considering the dip as a fraction of the maximum flux, but perhaps the planet's dip is being compared to the star's brightness when the spots are not present.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the planet's radius that would cause the same relative dip as the spots.

In that case, the planet's dip would be (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.05177 → R_p/R_s ≈ 0.2275.

But again, the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the problem statement.

The problem says: "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?"

Ah! Wait a second. The star is being compared to a case where it's not spotted. So the star's brightness without spots would have a certain value, and the planet would cause a dip when it transits.

But wait, the question is asking, when the star is not spotted, what planet radius would cause the same dip in brightness as the spotted star does.

Wait, no. The question says: "to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!)". So in other words, if the star wasn't spotted, what planet would cause the same dip as the spotted star does.

Wait, but the spotted star's dip is 5.177%, as calculated.

So if the star wasn't spotted, the dip would be the planet's effect, which is (R_p/R_s)^2.

So we set (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.05177 → R_p/R_s ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps the spots only cover a certain part of the star's surface when viewed from Earth. No, the problem says one hemisphere is completely covered. So when the star rotates, that entire hemisphere comes into view, causing the dip.

Hmm. Maybe the mistake is in assuming that the dip is 0.05177. Let me recompute this.

Compute 6000^4: 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 671e12.

Divide by 6000^4: 671e12 /1296e12 = 671 / 1296.

Compute 671 ÷ 1296:

Well, 1296 × 0.5 = 648. 671-648=23. So 0.5 + (23/1296) ≈ 0.5 + 0.0177 = 0.5177.

So 0.5177 multiplied by 0.1 (from the 10% coverage) gives 0.05177.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. So the relative dip is about 5.18%.

So the planet's dip should be the same, so (R_p/Rs)^2 = 0.0518 → R_p/Rs ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the effective temperature is 6000 K, but the star's luminosity is L = 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

But when the spots are present, the planet's effect is being compared to the spotted star. Wait no, the question says, "if the star was not covered by spots", so we're comparing the planet's effect to a star without spots.

So the dip due to the planet is (Rp/Rs)^2, which needs to be equal to the dip caused by the spots on the star.

Which is 0.05177 → R_p/Rs ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is for the planet to cause the same relative change as the spots do. But perhaps the scenario is that the planet's effect is on the same star, not comparing to a star without spots.

Wait, the question says, if the star was not covered by spots, what planet radius would produce the same amplitude.

So the star's brightness without spots is F0.

The planet's dip is (Rp/Rs)^2 F0.

The spot's dip is 0.05177 F0.

So set (Rp/Rs)^2 F0 = 0.05177 F0 → Rp/Rs = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

But since the options don't have this, perhaps I made an error in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the spots are only on one hemisphere, so the area of the spots as seen from Earth is 0.2 * (2 pi R^2) = 0.4 pi R^2. So the coverage is 0.4 pi R^2 / 4 pi R^2 = 0.1, as before.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the flux from the star as a sum of the unspotted hemisphere and the spotted hemisphere. So when the star rotates, sometimes the spotted hemisphere is visible, sometimes the unspotted.

Wait, each hemisphere is 2 pi R^2. One is spotted 20%, the other is unspotted.

Wait, perhaps the total flux is:

Flux_unspotted_hemisphere = 2 pi R^2 * sigma Teff^4.

Flux_spotted_hemisphere = (0.8 * 2 pi R^2 ) * sigma Teff^4 + 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 * sigma T_spot^4.

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

Flux = [0.8 * 2 pi R^2 * Teff^4 ] + [0.2 * 2 pi R^2 * T_spot^4 ] 

= 2 pi R^2 [0.8 Teff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4 ].

When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

Flux = 2 pi R^2 Teff^4.

So the difference in flux is:

ΔF = (2 pi R^2 Teff^4 ) - (2 pi R^2 [0.8 Teff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4 ]) 

= 2 pi R^2 [Teff^4 - 0.8 Teff^4 - 0.2 T_spot^4 ]

= 2 pi R^2 [0.2 Teff^4 - 0.2 T_spot^4 ]

= 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

= 0.4 pi R^2 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

Which is the same as before.

So the relative dip is 0.4 pi R^2 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / (4 pi R^2 Teff^4 ) = 0.1 ( (6000^4 -5000^4 ) /6000^4 ) ≈ 0.05177.

So I think my calculation is correct, and the R_p/Rs is about 0.2275.

Hmm, but the options don't include this. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the planet's effect as the same as the spot's effect in terms of the change in brightness, but perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the star's radius is the same as the Sun. Let me check: the star's radius is R_sun, so Rs = R_sun. The planet's radius is R_p, so R_p/Rs is the fraction.

Wait, but perhaps the star's radius cancels out. Let's see: the planet's relative radius is R_p/Rs. The dip is (R_p/Rs)^2.

So if (R_p/Rs)^2 = 0.05177 → R_p/Rs = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

But the options are:

A) ~0.39 → 0.39² is ~0.152 → higher than 0.05.

B) ~0.07 → 0.0049 → too low.

C) ~0.11 → 0.0121 → too low.

D) ~0.32 → 0.1024 → higher than 0.05.

So none match. Hmm. Maybe the initial approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spots are causing a decrease in flux, but the planet is causing a decrease in flux only when it's in front. The star's rotation makes the spots come into and out of view, leading to a periodic variation.

Wait, but the question says that the situation resembles an exoplanet, so the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same. So the planet's effect must have the same amplitude.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the planet's radius as a function of the star's radius, but perhaps I should consider that the star's light curve variation due to spots is a certain fraction, and the planet's is a certain fraction, and they're equal.

But perhaps I should think in terms of the delta F over F being the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the planet's radius to cause the same change in brightness as the star's spots, not the same dip. But that doesn't make sense. The planet blocks light, causing a dip, and the spots cause a dip in brightness when visible.

So I think the calculation is correct. But since the options don't have 0.23, perhaps I made a mistake, but I can't see where.

Wait, perhaps the problem was intended to calculate the relative change as (R_p/Rs) = sqrt(0.05) → ~0.2236 → ~0.22. So perhaps the correct answer is approximately 0.22, but that's not in the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using (Teff - T_spot) instead of the fourth power. Which would be a mistake, but perhaps that's the case.

Wait, let me try that. Suppose I mistakenly calculate the dip as (Teff - T_spot) instead of (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

So Teff is 6000 K, T_spot is 5000 K. The difference is 1000 K.

So the dip would be (1000/6000) → 1/6 ≈ 0.1667. Multiply by 0.1 (the area fraction), 0.01667, so about 1.667% dip.

Then the planet's dip would be (R_p/Rs)^2 = 0.01667 → R_p/Rs ≈ 0.129, approximately 0.13. Close to option C) ~0.11.

But that's a wrong approach because the flux is proportional to T^4, not T.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relative change in flux as T_spot / Teff.

But I don't think that's correct. I think using T^4 is correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the area of the spots as 20% of the entire star, not 20% of a hemisphere. Let's see.

If the spots cover 20% of the entire star's surface, then the area is 0.2 * 4 pi R^2.

Then the dip would be (0.2 * 4 pi R^2 ) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / (4 pi R^2 Teff^4 )

= 0.2 * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / Teff^4.

Which would be 0.2 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.1035, so about 10.35% dip. Then R_p/Rs would be sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217, which is approximately 0.32, option D.

Ah! So perhaps I misread the problem. The problem says that the spots cover one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. So the total area covered is 20% of a hemisphere, which is 10% of the entire star's surface (since a hemisphere is half the star). So the calculation I did earlier is correct, giving a dip of ~5.177%.

But if instead, the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, then the dip would be higher, and the planet's radius would be about 0.32, which is option D.

So perhaps the problem intended the filling factor to be 20% of the entire star's surface. Let me recheck the problem statement.

The problem says: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So area is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2, which is 10% of the star's surface.

So the initial approach is correct. But perhaps the intended answer is D) 0.32, which would be the case if the filling factor was 20% of the entire star.

So perhaps the problem intended the spots to cover 20% of the entire star, not just one hemisphere. In that case, the dip would be (0.2 * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ) /6000^4 = 0.2 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.1035.

Then R_p/Rs = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217, which is option D.

So perhaps the correct answer is D) ~0.32.

But based on the problem statement, I think the correct dip is about 5.177%, leading to R_p/Rs of about 0.2275, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended approach is to treat the filling factor as 20% of the entire star, leading to option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:  
   - Radius: Same as the Sun, \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \).  
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).  
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.  

2. **Spot Properties**:  
   - Temperature of spots: \( T_{\text{spot}} = 6000 - 1000 = 5000 \, \text{K} \).  
   - The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere, so the area of the spots is \( A_{\text{spots}} = 0.2 \times 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).  

3. **Planet Properties**:  
   - The planet's radius \( R_{\text{planet}} \) is to be determined such that the brightness variation caused by the planet equals the variation caused by the spots.  

### Analysis:
#### Step 1: Brightness Variation Due to Spots
The star's total flux without spots is:  
\[
F_{\text{max}} = 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4
\]  
When the spots are visible, the flux is reduced because the spotted regions emit less light. The flux in this case is:  
\[
F_{\text{min}} = \left(4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 - A_{\text{spots}}\right) \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 + A_{\text{spots}} \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4
\]  
The amplitude of the brightness variation (dip) is:  
\[
\Delta F = F_{\text{max}} - F_{\text{min}}
\]  
Substituting the expressions for \( F_{\text{max}} \) and \( F_{\text{min}} \):  
\[
\Delta F = A_{\text{spots}} \left(T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4\right) \sigma
\]  
The relative dip is:  
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{max}}} = \frac{A_{\text{spots}} \left(T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4\right)}{4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 T_{\text{eff}}^4}
\]  
Substituting \( A_{\text{spots}} = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \):  
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{max}}} = \frac{0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \left(T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4\right)}{4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 T_{\text{eff}}^4}
\]  
Simplify:  
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{max}}} = 0.1 \cdot \frac{T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4}
\]  
Substitute \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \):  
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{max}}} = 0.1 \cdot \frac{6000^4 - 5000^4}{6000^4}
\]  
Calculate \( 6000^4 = 1296 \times 10^{12} \) and \( 5000^4 = 625 \times 10^{12} \):  
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{max}}} = 0.1 \cdot \frac{671 \times 10^{12}}{1296 \times 10^{12}} \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.5177 \approx 0.05177
\]  
Thus, the relative dip caused by the spots is approximately \( 5.177\% \).

#### Step 2: Brightness Variation Due to a Planet
When a planet transits the star, it blocks a fraction of the star's light proportional to the planet's area relative to the star's area. The dip in brightness is:  
\[
\text{Dip} = \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2
\]  
To match the dip caused by the spots:  
\[
\left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.05177
\]  
Take the square root:  
\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx \sqrt{0.05177} \approx 0.2275
\]  

### Step 3: Comparing with the Options
The calculated value \( R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}} \approx 0.2275 \) does not match any of the provided options. However, if the problem intended the filling factor to apply to the entire star (not just one hemisphere), the area of the spots would be \( 0.2 \times 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.8\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \). Recomputing the dip in this case:  
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{max}}} = 0.2 \cdot \frac{6000^4 - 5000^4}{6000^4} \approx 0.2 \cdot 0.5177 \approx 0.1035
\]  
Then:  
\[
\left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.1035 \implies \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3217
\]  
This matches option **D) ~0.32**.  

### Conclusion:
Given the problem's phrasing, it likely assumes the filling factor applies to the entire star, leading to the correct answer:  

**Answer: D**
