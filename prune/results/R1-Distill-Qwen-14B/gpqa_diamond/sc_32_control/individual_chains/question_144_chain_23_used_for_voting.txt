Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a meson resonance. Hmm, the question is about finding the mean decay distance. Let me think about what I know.

So, the given data includes:
- Production energy E_X = 8 GeV
- Mass m_X = 1.2 GeV
- Width Γ_X = 320 MeV

I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle and the speed at which it travels. Oh right, the formula I think is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ), but wait, I need to make sure about the units.

Wait, also, particles that are moving quickly can travel a certain distance before decaying. So first, I probably need to find the lifetime τ of the meson. The lifetime is related to the particle's width through the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but I think for the mean lifetime, τ is approximately ħ divided by Γ. Because Γ is the decay width, which is related to the uncertainty in energy.

Wait, let me clarify. The decay width Γ is the total energy width of the resonance, and it's related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, is Γ the total decay width? Yes, I think that's right.

So first, I need to compute τ, the lifetime. Once I have that, I can find out how far the meson travels before decaying. That would be the average distance, which is c multiplied by τ, right? But wait, isn't the meson moving at a certain speed, so I should probably calculate its velocity first.

Wait, another thought: if the production energy is 8 GeV and the mass is 1.2 GeV, how does that affect the velocity? Because the energy is the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So the kinetic energy is E_X - m_X c². Since E_X is much larger than m_X c², the meson is probably moving at a speed close to the speed of light. But maybe I don't need to calculate the velocity because it's relativistic, and at high energies, the speed approaches c. So for approximation, maybe I can take the speed as approximately c. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's acceptable. Alternatively, calculate the velocity more precisely.

Wait, the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So E = γ m c². The rest mass energy is m c², which is 1.2 GeV. E_X is 8 GeV, so γ must be E_X / (m c²) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So γ is about 6.6667. 

Then, using γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), where β is v/c. So solving for β:

γ^2 = 1/(1 - β²)
1 - β² = 1/γ^2
β² = 1 - 1/(γ^2)
β = sqrt(1 - 1/(γ^2)).

Plugging in γ=6.6667, let's compute 1/(γ^2) = 1/(44.444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So β ≈ 0.9887, which is about 0.9887c. So the speed is very close to c. Maybe I can use v ≈ c for approximation, but perhaps the precise calculation is better.

But wait, for the decay length, I think I need to find the meson's velocity. Because the lifetime is proper time (τ), and the actual time experienced in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. Wait, no, the lifetime τ is the proper lifetime. So the time experienced in the lab frame is γ τ, and the distance is v multiplied by that time, which would be v γ τ.

Wait, let me think step by step.

1. Find the proper lifetime τ: τ = ħ / Γ.
But wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s. Let me check: ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

Wait, no, the value of ħ in GeV·s is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Because ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s, and 1 GeV is 1.602e-10 J. So converting ħ to GeV·s: 1.0545718e-34 J·s / (1.602e-10 J/GeV) ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So, τ = ħ / Γ. But Γ is given in MeV, so I need to convert units. Γ=320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. 6.582 /0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

So τ ≈ 2.057e-24 seconds.

Now, the lifetime in the lab frame is γ τ. Because the meson is moving, time dilation occurs.

Earlier, I found that γ is approximately 8/(1.2) ≈ 6.6667.

So the lifetime in the lab frame is τ_lab = γ τ ≈ 6.6667 * 2.057e-24 s ≈ 1.371e-23 seconds.

Wait, no. Wait, proper lifetime is τ, so the lab frame's lifetime is longer: τ_lab = γ τ.

So the lifetime in lab frame is longer by a factor of gamma.

Then, the distance is v multiplied by τ_lab. What is v?

Earlier, I calculated β ≈ 0.9887, so v ≈ 0.9887c. Let me compute v:

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute v as beta * c, with beta given by sqrt(1 - (m/(E))^2). Wait, since E = γ m c², and m is rest mass. So E = gamma m c².

Wait, E = 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

So beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Which is sqrt(1 - ( (1.2/8)^2 )) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.98869.

So beta ≈ 0.98869, so v ≈ 0.98869 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So the distance L is v multiplied by the lab frame lifetime τ_lab.

So L = v * τ_lab = v * gamma * tau.

Wait, tau is the proper lifetime, so tau_lab = gamma tau.

Thus, L = v * gamma tau.

Alternatively, since gamma = E/(m c²), and beta = sqrt(1 - (m c²/(E))^2 ), but perhaps I can express L as (v gamma tau) = (beta c gamma tau).

But tau is ħ/(Gamma).

So putting it all together:

L = beta c gamma tau

But tau = ħ / Gamma.

So L = beta c gamma ( ħ / Gamma )

But gamma is E/(m c²). Because E = gamma m c².

So gamma = E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) ≈ 6.6667.

So putting it all together:

L = beta * c * (E/(m c²)) * ( ħ / Gamma )

Wait, but E and m are given in GeV and GeV/c²?

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute each term step by step.

Calculating each component:

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

tau = ħ / Gamma = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = approx 2.057e-24 s.

gamma = E/(m c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667.

beta = sqrt(1 - (m c²/E)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So lab frame lifetime is tau_lab = gamma tau = 6.6667 * 2.057e-24 s ≈ 1.371e-23 s.

Distance L = v * tau_lab = (beta c) * tau_lab.

So beta c ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So L ≈ 2.966e8 m/s * 1.371e-23 s ≈ 2.966e8 * 1.371e-23.

Calculating that: 2.966e8 * 1.371e-23 = (2.966 * 1.371) * 1e-15.

2.966 * 1.371 ≈ let's compute that.

2.966 * 1.371 = 2.966*(1 + 0.3 + 0.07 + 0.001) = 2.966 + 0.8898 + 0.20762 + 0.002966 ≈ 2.966 + 0.8898 is 3.8558, plus 0.20762 is 4.06342, plus 0.002966 is 4.066386. So approximately 4.066e-15 meters.

Wait, wait, because 2.966e8 * 1.371e-23 = (2.966 * 1.371) * 1e8 * 1e-23 = (approx 4.066) * 1e-15.

So L ≈ 4.066e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Hmm, so approximately 4.066e-15, which is very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but why is this so close? Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in beta. Let me recalculate beta more precisely.

beta = sqrt(1 - (m c² / E)^2 )

m c² is 1.2 GeV, E is 8 GeV.

So (m c² / E ) = 1.2 /8 = 0.15.

(0.15)^2 =0.0225.

1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) = ?

Let me compute it more accurately. sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887.

But let me see: 0.9887 squared is (approx) 0.9775.

Yes, 0.9887^2 = (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 ≈ 0.98² + 2*(0.98)*(0.0087) + (0.0087)^2 ≈ 0.9604 + 0.0172 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.97767569, which is a bit higher than 0.9775. So perhaps beta is a bit less than 0.9887.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator approach.

Wait, 0.9887^2 = 0.97767569, which is higher than 0.9775.

So to get sqrt(0.9775) exactly, it's slightly less than 0.9887. Let me compute 0.9886^2:

0.9886^2 = ?

Let's compute 0.9886 * 0.9886.

Compute as (0.98 + 0.0086)^2:

= 0.98^2 + 2*(0.98)(0.0086) + (0.0086)^2

= 0.9604 + (2 * 0.98 * 0.0086) + 0.00007396

0.98 * 0.0086 = 0.008428.

2 * 0.008428 = 0.016856.

So 0.9604 + 0.016856 = 0.977256.

Plus 0.00007396, so total 0.97732996.

But 0.97733 is still a bit lower than 0.9775.

So 0.9886^2 = 0.97733.

We need to reach 0.9775. So the difference is 0.9775 - 0.97733 = 0.00017.

So how much more than 0.9886 do we need to go?

Let me approximate: Let x = 0.9886 + delta.

We have (x)^2 = 0.9775.

We can write:

(x)^2 = (0.9886 + delta)^2 ≈ 0.9886^2 + 2*0.9886*delta.

Set this equal to 0.9775.

We have 0.97733 + 2*0.9886 * delta = 0.9775.

So 2*0.9886 * delta = 0.9775 - 0.97733 = 0.00017.

So delta ≈ 0.00017 / (2*0.9886) ≈ 0.00017 / 1.9772 ≈ 8.6e-5.

So x ≈ 0.9886 + 0.000086 ≈ 0.988686.

So beta is approximately 0.988686.

Let me compute beta more accurately for higher precision.

Let me compute 0.988686^2:

0.988686 * 0.988686.

= (0.98 + 0.008686)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*(0.98)*(0.008686) + (0.008686)^2.

0.98^2 = 0.9604.

2 * 0.98 * 0.008686 = 2 * 0.008512 = 0.017024.

(0.008686)^2 ≈ 0.00007543.

Adding up: 0.9604 + 0.017024 = 0.977424, plus 0.00007543 gives 0.97749943, which is very close to 0.9775.

So beta ≈ 0.988686.

Thus, beta is approximately 0.988686.

So let me recalculate v = beta c ≈ 0.988686 * 3e8 m/s = 2.966058e8 m/s.

Now, tau is 2.057e-24 s.

gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666667.

So tau_lab = gamma * tau = 6.6666667 * 2.057e-24 s.

Let me compute that:

6.6666667 * 2.057e-24 = (6 * 2.057e-24) + (0.6666667 * 2.057e-24).

6 * 2.057e-24 = 1.2342e-23.

0.6666667 * 2.057e-24 ≈ 1.3713e-24.

Adding together: 1.2342e-23 + 0.13713e-23 = 1.37133e-23 s.

So tau_lab ≈ 1.37133e-23 s.

Now, distance L = v * tau_lab.

v is 2.966058e8 m/s.

tau_lab is 1.37133e-23 s.

So L = 2.966058e8 m/s * 1.37133e-23 s = (2.966058 * 1.37133) * 1e-15 m.

Compute 2.966058 * 1.37133.

Let me compute that:

2.966 * 1.37133.

Let me compute:

2 * 1.37133 = 2.74266.

0.966 * 1.37133 = ?

0.966 * 1 = 0.966.

0.966 * 0.37133 ≈ 0.966 * 0.37 = 0.35742, and 0.966 *0.00133≈ 0.001287.

So add 0.966 + 0.35742 + 0.001287 ≈ 1.3247.

So 2 * 1.37133 is 2.74266, plus 0.966 * 1.37133 ≈ 1.3247. So total is approx 2.74266 + 1.3247 = 4.06736.

So L ≈ 4.06736e-15 meters.

Looking back at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, very close. Why the discrepancy? Maybe I made a calculation error somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me compute 2.966058e8 * 1.37133e-23.

Alternatively, exact calculation:

2.966058 * 1.37133 = ?

Let me calculate 2.966058 × 1.37133:

Let me write it as:

1.37133 × 2.966058.

Break it down:

1.37133 × 2 = 2.74266

1.37133 × 0.9 = 1.234197

1.37133 × 0.06 = 0.0822798

1.37133 × 0.006 = 0.00822798

1.37133 × 0.000058 = ~0.000079515.

Adding all these:

2.74266 + 1.234197 = 3.976857

3.976857 + 0.0822798 = 4.0591368

4.0591368 + 0.00822798 = 4.06736478

4.06736478 + 0.000079515 ≈ 4.0674443.

So approximately 4.06744e-15 meters.

But the option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Hmm, why the difference?

Wait, perhaps I should check the initial calculation of tau.

Tau = ħ / Gamma.

Given ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s, and Gamma is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = ?

6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.

6.582 ÷ 0.32.

0.32 × 20 = 6.4, so 0.32 × 20.56875 = 6.582.

Yes, 20.56875 ×0.32= 6.582.

So tau is 20.56875e-25 seconds = 2.056875e-24 s.

Which is what I had before.

So the calculation for tau is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.6666666667.

So gamma is approximately 6.6666666667.

So tau_lab = 6.6666666667 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute that.

6.6666666667 * 2.056875e-24.

6 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.234125e-23.

0.6666666667 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.056875e-24) * (2/3) )= approximately 1.37125e-24.

So total is 1.234125e-23 + 1.37125e-24 = 1.234125e-23 + 0.137125e-23 = 1.37125e-23 s.

So no issue there.

Now, the velocity v is 0.988686 * 3e8 m/s.

0.988686 * 3e8 = 2.966058e8 m/s.

So tau_lab is 1.37125e-23 s.

So L = 2.966058e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Which is 2.966058e8 * 1.37125e-23.

Multiply 2.966058 × 1.37125.

Let me compute that more accurately.

2.966058 × 1.37125.

Let me compute:

1.37125 × 2 = 2.7425.

1.37125 × 0.966058 = ?

Wait, 0.966058 is approximately 0.96606.

So 1.37125 * 0.96606.

Compute 1.37125 * 0.9 = 1.234125.

1.37125 * 0.06 = 0.082275.

1.37125 * 0.00606 = 0.008316225.

Adding these: 1.234125 + 0.082275 = 1.3164, plus 0.008316225 gives 1.324716225.

So total 2.7425 + 1.324716225 ≈ 4.067216225.

So L ≈ 4.0672e-15 meters.

But option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Hmm, why the slight difference? Maybe I made a mistake in some calculation steps.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in reality, the decay width is given in MeV, and perhaps I should convert ħ into MeV·s units.

Wait, ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s, which is 6.582e-25 * 1e3 MeV·s = 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

Wait, no, because 1 GeV = 1e3 MeV. So 1 GeV·s = 1e3 MeV·s.

So ħ in MeV·s is 6.582e-25 GeV·s * 1e3 MeV/GeV = 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

So tau = ħ / Gamma = (6.582e-22 MeV·s) / (320 MeV) = (6.582e-22 / 320) s ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

Which is the same as before. So no mistake there.

Another thought: Maybe the problem expects to ignore beta and just use c. That is, approximate v as c.

If I do that, then L = gamma * c * tau.

Tau is 2.057e-24 s.

gamma is 6.6666667.

So L = 6.6666667 * 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.

Wait, no, no. tau_lab is gamma * tau, and L = v * tau_lab. If I approximate v as c, then L = c * gamma tau.

So tau = 2.057e-24 s.

So L = 3e8 m/s * 6.6666667 * 2.057e-24 s.

Multiply 3e8 * 6.6666667 = 2e9 m/s.

Wait, 3e8 * 6.6666667 is 2e9? Let me compute.

3e8 * 6.6666667 = 3e8 * (20/3) )= (2e9 ) * (3/3) = 2e9. No, wait, 3e8 * 6.6666667 = 3e8 * (20/3) )= 2e9.

Wait, 3e8 * (20/3) = (3e8 * 20) ) /3 = (6e9) /3 = 2e9.

So 3e8 m/s * 6.6666667 = 2e9 m/s.

Then multiply by tau = 2.057e-24 s: 2e9 * 2.057e-24 = 4.114e-15 m.

Which is 4.114e-15 m. But that's larger than the previous calculation. So that can't be right because I approximated v as c, which is higher than the actual v.

So perhaps the option expects the precise calculation, leading to approximately 4.067e-15 m, which is option B.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option B) 4.0655 *1e-15 m.

Option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

So our calculation is 4.067e-15, which is very close to option B.

So the correct answer should be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance, we use the relationship between the proper lifetime \( \tau \), the decay width \( \Gamma \), and the relativistic effects due to the particle's motion. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Proper Lifetime Calculation**:  
   The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
   \]  
   Given \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \), we calculate:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.057 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
   \]

2. **Relativistic Time Dilation**:  
   The lifetime in the lab frame \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \) is extended due to time dilation:  
   \[
   \tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau,
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \). Given \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m c^2 = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), we find:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
   \]  
   Thus:  
   \[
   \tau_{\text{lab}} = 6.6667 \times 2.057 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.371 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
   \]

3. **Velocity of the Meson**:  
   The velocity \( v \) is determined using the relativistic relation:  
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{m c^2}{E}\right)^2}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( \frac{m c^2}{E} = \frac{1.2}{8} = 0.15 \), we calculate:  
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - (0.15)^2} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
   \]  
   Therefore, the velocity is:  
   \[
   v = \beta c \approx 0.9887 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.

4. **Mean Decay Distance**:  
   The mean decay distance \( L \) is the product of the velocity \( v \) and the lab frame lifetime \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \):  
   \[
   L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( v \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \approx 1.371 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \), we find:  
   \[
   L = 2.966 \times 10^8 \cdot 1.371 \times 10^{-23} \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
   \]

5. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated decay distance \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is very close to option B, \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \). The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding during intermediate steps.
