Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's think it through.

First, what do I remember about SMEFT? SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's a framework used to describe the Standard Model at a high energy scale, incorporating all possible higher-dimensional operators that can correct the Standard Model interactions. These operators are organized by their dimensionality, like dimension 6, 7, etc.

Now, the question is about symmetries. Symmetries in physics dictate the form of the laws and the possible interactions. Effective theories should respect certain symmetries, but SMEFT might modify them in specific ways.

Looking at the options: Lorentz Symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The question asks which of these must be respected by all operators.

Wait, Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, right? Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it should respect Poincaré symmetry. Because if it didn't, the theory wouldn't make sense in a relativistic context. So operators must transform covariantly under Poincaré, which implies Lorentz as well.

Wait, but wait. The options are given as 1,2,3,4. The question is which must be respected. So if Poincaré is included in another symmetry, maybe I have to think about which are fundamental.

Wait, but the SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. But Poincaré includes both Lorentz and translational symmetries. So if SMEFT respects Poincaré, it would imply Lorentz as well. But perhaps the question is considering which are necessary.

Wait, but if an operator doesn't respect Poincaré, it's not a valid operator in the theory. So all operators must respect Poincaré symmetry, which includes Lorentz and translations. So Lorentz symmetry is automatically respected because of Poincaré.

Wait, but the options are 1 (Lorentz) and 2 (Poincaré). So if both are correct, then which one is the right approach. Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased as which symmetries must be respected, meaning that Poincaré is a higher level symmetry that includes Lorentz. So perhaps the correct operators must respect Poincaré, which implies they also respect Lorentz, but the question presents both as separate options.

Hmm. Maybe I need to think about which symmetries are explicitly enforced. Effective operators are constructed with the same symmetries as the Standard Model. Because the SM respects Poincaré, so do the SMEFT operators. So all SMEFT operators must respect Poincaré symmetry, which includes Lorentz.

Wait, but looking at the options, the answer choices are combinations. For example, option A is 1 and 2 (Lorentz and Poincare). Option C is 1,2,4.

But wait another thought: CPT symmetry is a bigger symmetry. The CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory must be CPT-symmetric. So SMEFT, being a Lorentz-invariant theory, must respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, all operators must respect CPT. So if CPT is required, then 4 is correct.

Then, looking at the options, the correct symmetries are Poincaré (2), Lorentz (1), and CPT (4). Wait, but I thought that Poincaré includes Lorentz. So if 2 is correct, does that mean 1 is automatically correct? Or does the question consider them as separate?

Alternatively, perhaps in this context, the question expects you to think about whether each symmetry is individually required, regardless of what it's a subset of.

Wait, but the question is about what must be respected by all operators. So if Poincaré is required, then Lorentz is automatically okay. But I'm not sure if the question is considering both as separate. Alternatively, perhaps the correct symmetries are 1,2,4.

Wait, but let me think about each symmetry. The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry. Therefore, any effective operator added should also respect CPT. So all SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry. So 4 is correct.

Poincaré symmetry: Since SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, it must respect Poincaré because it's a relativistic theory. So 2 is correct, which brings 1 as correct as well because Poincaré includes Lorentz.

So operators must respect Poincaré, which includes Lorentz. Therefore, 1 and 2 would both be correct. But wait, the problem is that Poincaré is a larger symmetry. So if all operators respect Poincaré, they automatically respect Lorentz. So including Lorentz (option 1) is redundant because 2 is included.

But the question is which must be respected by all operators. So if Poincaré is the larger symmetry that must be respected, then both 1 and 2 are correct. But perhaps the question treats them as separate. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering whether each symmetry is a requirement.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think step by step.

Which operators must respect:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: All operators in the SMEFT must transform covariantly under Lorentz transformations. Because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory.

2. Poincaré symmetry: Poincaré is Lorentz + translations. SMEFT is a field theory, so it should respect Poincaré. All operators must.

3. CP symmetry: CP is charge conjugation and parity. The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry in general. For example, CP violation is present in the CKM matrix. So in SMEFT, operators can violate CP, as long as they are consistent with the SM's CP properties. So not all operators must respect CP; some may violate it. So 3 is not required to be respected by all operators.

4. CPT symmetry: The CPT theorem says that any Lorentz-invariant QFT must be CPT-symmetric. So since SMEFT is a QFT that's Lorentz-invariant, all operators must respect CPT symmetry. So 4 is correct.

So now, which options are correct: 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincaré), 4 (CPT).

Wait, but if 2 (Poincaré) is correct, then 1 is automatically correct because Poincaré includes Lorentz. So why would the question include both 1 and 2 as options? Or perhaps in the SMEFT, the Poincaré symmetry is already enforced, so the operators are required to respect both, but maybe the question considers them as separate.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that Poincaré includes Lorentz, so the correct answer includes both 1 and 2. But wait, in reality, if you respect Poincaré, you automatically respect Lorentz. So perhaps the answer includes 2, and also 4.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option C) 1,2,4: So Lorentz, Poincaré, and CPT.

Option 4 is correct, so the answer would include 4. Also, since 2 must be correct, 1 is correct as part of 2. So if 2 is correct, 1 is correct. So the correct options would be 2 and 4, but looking at the choices, there's no option with 2 and 4. Let me look:

The options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

Wait, option C includes 1,2,4. So if 2 includes 1, then 1 is automatically correct. But if the question lists 1 and 2 as separate, does that mean we have to count them both?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased such that each symmetry is considered independently, regardless of whether one implies the other.

Wait, but Poincaré is not just Lorentz; it's Lorentz plus translations. So if an operator doesn't respect translation symmetry, does the SMEFT require it? Well, SMEFT is a field theory which is built upon local symmetries. So operators must transform correctly under all the symmetries of Poincaré. So if SMEFT respects Poincaré, then all operators must respect Poincaré.

But the options are 1,2,3,4 as separate, so the presence of 2 requires that 1 is also correct.

So in that case, the correct symmetries would be 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). So option C is 1,2,4, which would be correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought that if you have Poincaré, you don't need to separately have Lorentz. But perhaps the question treats them as separate and requires both. Or perhaps the question is considering that 1 and 2 are both required.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe the SMEFT doesn't require Poincaré symmetry, but that seems unlikely because it's a field theory. Field theories must respect Poincaré.

Wait, maybe another approach. What do the SMEFT operators look like? They are constructed as Lorentz-invariant operators. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar. Therefore, all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (1 is correct). Poincaré is a larger symmetry, but perhaps in this context, the question includes both Lorentz and Poincaré as separate, but the SMEFT must respect both. But wait, if Poincaré requires both Lorentz and translation, and SMEFT is a theory that includes spacetime translations, then it must respect Poincaré.

Wait, but the SMEFT is formulated as a Lorentz-invariant theory, but perhaps the operators are built to be Lorentz scalars, but not necessarily Poincaré. Wait, no, because the SMEFT is a field theory, which by definition respects Poincaré symmetry.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to break it down.

Which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect?

- Lorentz symmetry: Yes, because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. Operators must be Lorentz scalars.

- Poincaré symmetry: Yes, as it includes Lorentz and translations. So any operator must respect this.

- CP symmetry: No, because not all operators are CP-symmetric. For example, operators that induce CP violation would be allowed if the SM allows it.

- CPT symmetry: Yes, because any Lorentz-invariant QFT must respect CPT. So all operators must respect CPT.

So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4.

So the answer should be C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory), we analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and all operators must transform covariantly under Lorentz transformations. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it must respect Poincaré symmetry. This implies that all operators must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry involves charge conjugation and parity. The Standard Model (SM) does not universally respect CP symmetry (e.g., CP violation occurs in the CKM matrix). Consequently, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry, as some operators may violate it.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory must respect CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, all operators must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not required to be respected by all operators.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **C) 1, 2, 4**.
