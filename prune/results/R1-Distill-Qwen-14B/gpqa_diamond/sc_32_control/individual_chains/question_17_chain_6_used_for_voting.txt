Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the problem is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex with a concentration of 0.02 M. The temperature is given as 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, meaning it binds to metal ions like calcium. The complex formed is Ca-EDTA. So the problem is dealing with the dissociation of this complex into calcium ions and EDTA.

The formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The formula for Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in this problem, the K is given as 5x10^10. So K_Ca-EDTA is the formation constant.

Now, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But because the complex can dissociate, some of it will break down into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- ions.

The reaction would be: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

But since K is a large number (5x10^10), this suggests that the complex is very stable, meaning that not much of it will dissociate. So the concentrations of Ca^2+ and free EDTA should be very low.

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of calcium ions. So if the complex doesn't dissociate much, the [Ca^2+] should be low.

Let me think about the approach. Let's denote the concentration of the complex as C, which is 0.02 M. Because the complex dissociates into one Ca^2+ and one EDTA^4-, the concentration of each will be x, where x is the amount dissociated.

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's say it dissociates by x M. Then:

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x will be very small compared to 0.02, because Kf is large).

[Ca^2+] = x

[EDTA^4-] = x

Wait, but EDTA is usually in a solution where it's deprotonated. The problem says the pH is ideal, so I think we can assume that all the EDTA is in the Y^4- form. So, [EDTA^4-] is x, and [Ca^2+] is x.

So putting this into the Kf expression:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] )

We can substitute:

5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x)

So 5e10 = 0.02 / x²

Wait, solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10 = 4e-13.

Wait, let me calculate that again. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/(5)) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So x² = 4e-13.

Taking the square root, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, and sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7. Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, but 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So 2e-6.5 is 2 * 3.16e-7, which is about 6.32e-7. Wait, wait, because sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Or is it 2e-6.5? Let me compute.

Wait, 4e-13 =4 * 10^-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So square root is 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7. So x ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7 M. That must be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the setup. The Kf is 5e10, and the solution is 0.02 M of the complex. The assumption is that x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Because Kf is so large, the complex doesn't dissociate much, so x is indeed tiny.

So [Ca^2+] is x, which is approximately 6.3e-7 M. So option C is the answer.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The equilibrium expression for the formation constant is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let the concentration of the dissociated calcium ions and free EDTA ions be \( x \). Since the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M and dissociation is minimal (due to the large \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \)), we approximate \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
