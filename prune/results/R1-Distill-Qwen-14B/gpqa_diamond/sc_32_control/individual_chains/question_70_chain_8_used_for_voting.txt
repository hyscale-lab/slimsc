Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the question is about a series of reactions, and we're supposed to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A to D, and they're all different symmetry groups. I'm a bit rusty on my molecular symmetry, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let's break down the reactions given:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

Hmm. The goal is to find the molecular symmetry group of E. So, I'll probably need to figure out what E is first. Let's start by figuring out what each compound is.

Let me think about each reaction.

Starting with reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red). Bright red product makes me think of something like copper(II) oxide or maybe a transition metal oxide. But wait, the stoichiometry is 8 equivalents of B. Hmm. Wait, if B is a gas, maybe it's a diatomic, like O2 or Cl2? Or maybe something else.

When C reacts with water to give A, F, and G. So, C is probably an oxide because when it reacts with water, it could form acids. For example, if C is a metal oxide, reacting with water would form a metal hydroxide, but then perhaps an acid if it's a non-metal oxide.

Wait, but in the reaction, C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, perhaps C is a salt of some kind? Or maybe a metal oxide?

Wait, another angle: the reaction of C with D produces E. And D reacts with B to form H, a solvent. Solvents like H2O, ethanol, etc., but common ones like H2O, but D and B combining 1:1. Let's think about possible reactions.

Let me try to figure out possible identities for B and D. Let's suppose B is O2, a diatomic gas. Then D, when reacting with B, would form H. If H is a solvent, perhaps something like H2O or maybe something else.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe B is Cl2? Because sometimes when Cl2 is involved in reactions, it can lead to colored products. Alternatively, maybe B is O2, given the common red products in some reactions.

Wait, reaction 1 uses 8 equivalents of B, which makes me think of a reaction where B is a diatomic molecule. Let's say B is O2. Then 8 moles would be 4 diatomic molecules (since each molecule is two atoms). Wait, but 8 equivalents would be 8 moles of B? Or 8 moles in total? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, let me think of a reaction where the stoichiometry is such that 8 equivalents are used. It could be something like sulfur reacting with oxygen: S8 + O2 → SO3 or something else.

Wait, but the product C is bright red. Sulfur trioxide is a colorless gas, but maybe if it's another compound. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is with a metal. Like CuO is black, not red. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but maybe another. Alternatively, perhaps C is a vanadium compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a dichromate or some other compound. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide with a red color. Lead dioxide (PbO2) is dark brown, but maybe another. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is of a metal with a diatomic gas like chlorine. For example, say, Fe reacting with Cl2 to form FeCl3.

But wait, FeCl3 is yellow, not red. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: in reaction 3, C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So perhaps C is an anhydride. For example, if C is SO3 (sulfur trioxide), which is a gas, but when it reacts with water, it forms H2SO4 (strong acid) and... wait, but H2SO4 is a strong acid, but where would a weak acid come from? Hmm, that might not fit.

Wait, another possibility: if C is a mixed anhydride or perhaps a salt. Wait, no, perhaps C is a metal oxide. Let's think: if C is a metal oxide, say, CuO, but that's black. Alternatively, maybe it's a non-metal oxide. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitride or something else.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the reaction between C and D. C + 2D → E. E is extremely hazardous. Hmm, maybe E is something like phosgene, but that's a stretch. Or perhaps E is a highly toxic gas, like HCl, but that's just a guess.

Wait, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So, D + B → H. If H is a solvent, perhaps it's H2O. Then, let's think: what reacts with B (say, Cl2) to form H2O? That would require a reaction like 2H2O + Cl2 → HCl + HClO? No, that's not a 1:1 ratio. Or perhaps another reaction. Alternatively, maybe H is ethanol, but that would require D and B to react in a way that forms ethanol. That seems less likely.

Wait, another thought: Maybe H is NH3, but that's a gas, not a solvent, perhaps. Alternatively, H is H2O.

Wait, perhaps D is HCl and B is NaOH, but that might not fit. Alternatively, think about D being something like H2 and B being O2; H2 + O2 → H2O. But that's a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2. Then, O2 + 2H2 → 2H2O. Hmm, that's 2 H2 per O2, so the ratio is 2:1, but the problem states a 1:1 ratio. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is H2. Then, Cl2 + H2 → 2HCl. That is a 1:1 ratio. So, that's possible. So, D is H2, B is Cl2, and H is HCl? Wait, but HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm, that might not fit. Or perhaps H is something else.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2, and D is H2O. Then, Cl2 + H2O → HClO and HCl. But that's more of a disproportionation, but the stoichiometry is 1 Cl2 to 2 HClO and 2 HCl, but that's not 1:1. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps H is a different solvent. Let me think of something else. If B is O2 and D is H2, then O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O. But that's 2:1 ratio, so not 1:1. So not matching.

Another possibility: B is F2? But F2 is a very reactive gas. Then D could be H2O, but F2 + H2O → O2 + HF. Wait, let me check the reaction. F2 + H2O → 2 HF + O2. Hmm, that's 1 F2 to 1 O2, but perhaps the stoichiometry isn't matching. Alternatively, perhaps another reaction.

Wait, perhaps H is something like NH3. Then, what would D and B be? For example, if D is NH3 and B is O2, but the reaction would be something like 4 NH3 + 3 O2 → 2 N2 + 6 H2O. But that's a 4:3 ratio, not 1:1.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on figuring out what B and D are. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Let me look at reaction 3 again. C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So perhaps C is a metal oxide, and the reaction produces a strong and weak acid. Wait, but metal oxides usually form bases when reacting with water, not acids. Unless it's a non-metal oxide.

Ah, right! Non-metal oxides like SO3, CO2, etc., when reacted with water, form acids. So, perhaps C is a non-metal oxide. For example, SO3 would form H2SO4 (strong acid) and... wait, but H2SO4 is a strong acid, so maybe another acid? Or perhaps C is a mixed anhydride or something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a sulfite or something else. Or perhaps it's a compound that when hydrolyzed gives two different acids.

Wait, let's think of a compound that upon hydration gives two acids. For example, perhaps something like a sulfite (SO2) reacting with water to form H2SO3 (weak acid) and maybe another acid, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate or another compound. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about E being a highly hazardous product. So E could be a highly toxic gas or compound. If E is formed by C reacting with 2 equivalents of D, which reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.

Suppose E is something like phosgene (which is highly toxic), but I'm not sure how that would fit the rest of the reactions.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe C is a chloride, and D is something like H2O. But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is HCl gas, but that's not extremely hazardous in that form, though it's dangerous. But the question says extremely hazardous, so maybe something like HCN or sarin or something else. Hmm, but not sure.

Wait, let's think about possible E's molecular structure and symmetry. The options are symmetry groups. Let's look at the options:

A) C2: which is a 2-fold rotation axis.

B) D4h: which is a point group with a 4-fold rotation axis, horizontal mirrors, etc.

C) D∞h: an infinite symmetry group, like in a linear molecule with multiple identical atoms, such as O2 or HCN (but HCN isn't linear with D∞h).

Wait, D∞h is the symmetry group for a linear molecule with an infinite number of identical atoms, like CO2 (which is linear but D∞h? No, CO2 is D∞h. Wait, linear molecules have D∞h symmetry. So, if E is a linear molecule, maybe D∞h is the group.

Hmm, but if E is a molecule like O2, which is diatomic, it belongs to D∞h symmetry. Alternatively, H2O has C2v symmetry.

Wait, another thought: if E is O2, which is a diatomic molecule, its point group is D∞h. Because diatomic molecules all have D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but what if E is O3? Ozone is a triatomic molecule with a bent structure. Its point group is D3h, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, maybe E is another molecule.

Wait, let me get back to the reactions. C reacts with D to form E. If D is H2O, then maybe C is a metal oxide. But earlier I thought C is a non-metal oxide, but perhaps not.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about the reaction of C with water giving two acids. So, maybe C is a sulfite, which upon hydrolysis gives H2SO3 (weak acid) and something else. Hmm, but where would a strong acid come from?

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfate, but when it reacts with water, it would form H2SO4, a strong acid, but where is the weak acid coming from?

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed anhydride. For example, something like (HO)SO3H? No, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate, but nitrates usually form HNO3, a strong acid, but perhaps in some cases, other acids are formed.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of C as a sulfite. Let's say C is Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, but wait, sodium sulfite in water would just dissociate into Na+ and SO3^2- which hydrolyzes to produce HSO3^- and OH^-? No, perhaps that's not leading to two acids.

Wait, maybe C is a metal carbonate. But then, upon reaction with water, it would produce a metal hydroxide and CO2. Hmm, but that wouldn't give two acids.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfate of some sort, but that's not leading me anywhere.

Wait, maybe C is a metal oxide. Let's say A is a metal, and C is its oxide. So when C reacts with water, it forms a base, but the problem says it forms two acids. So that's conflicting because metal oxides usually form bases (hydroxides) when reacting with water. Non-metal oxides form acids.

So, if C is a non-metal oxide, and when it reacts with water, it produces a strong acid and a weak acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed oxide, like SOCl2? No, because that would react with water to form HCl and SO2, but HCl is a strong acid, and SO2 is a gas, not an acid. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a compound like (NH4)2CO3, which upon heating decomposes, but when reacted with water, it would just stay as the same compound. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonamide or something else, but that's probably too complex.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal dichloride, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a peroxide. For example, H2O2 is an oxidizing agent. But when it decomposes, it forms H2O and O2. That's a decomposition, not hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride, like Si3N4, but that's a solid and would react with water to form NH3 and silicic acid. Hmm, but NH3 is a base, so that's not fitting because the products are acids.

Hmm, perhaps I'm going down the wrong path. Let me try to think of E first, since the options are about E's symmetry.

If E is a diatomic molecule, its point group would be D∞h. For example, O2, HCl, etc. If E is a triatomic molecule, like CO2 is linear (but that's O=C=O, which is D∞h). Wait, CO2 is linear, so D∞h.

Wait, another possibility: E is O3, which is a bent molecule with a C2v point group. But O3's point group is D3h, I think.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the point groups. Let me recall: 

- For diatomic molecules, the point group is D∞h.

- For linear triatomic molecules (like CO2), it's D∞h because of the linear structure.

- For a bent triatomic like H2O, it's C2v.

So if E is a linear molecule, its point group would be D∞h (option C). If it's a bent molecule, maybe C2v (option D).

So the options are:

A) C2

B) D4h

C) D∞h

D) C2v

So, if E is a linear molecule, the answer would be C (D∞h). If it's something else, like a bent molecule with a C2v symmetry, the answer would be D.

Now, to find what E is.

E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. C is the product from A and 8 B. So, let's think about C. Let's assume that C is a metal oxide, but earlier I thought it's a non-metal oxide.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent), 1:1 ratio.

Suppose B is Cl2, D is H2. Then, Cl2 + H2 → 2 HCl. So H would be HCl, but that's a gas, not a solvent. So that may not fit.

Alternatively, B is O2, D is H2. Then, O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O. The ratio is 1 O2 : 2 H2 → 2 H2O. So the ratio of D to B is 2:1, but the problem says 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: B is F2, D is H2O. Then, F2 + H2O → O2 + 2 HF. But that's a 1:1 ratio of F2 and H2O. So H would be O2? No, O2 is a gas, not a solvent. That doesn't seem right.

Hmm, maybe B is Cl2 and D is CH4. Then, Cl2 + CH4 → under certain conditions, but that's more about substitution reactions, perhaps. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe B is O2 and D is C (carbon). Then, O2 + C → CO or CO2. But that's a 1:1 ratio for C and O2, but the product would be a gas, not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is CH4O (like formaldehyde?), but not sure.

Wait, perhaps D is NH3 and B is O2: 4 NH3 + 3 O2 → 2 N2 + 6 H2O. But the ratio here is 4:3, not 1:1.

Hmm, maybe this approach isn't working. Let me try to think of another way.

Let me think about the possible C and E.

Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E.

If E is a linear molecule, like CO2, then D would be something that reacts with C to form CO2.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a carbonate. Suppose C is Na2CO3. Then, reacting with water would give 2 NaOH (strong base) plus CO2 (which is an acid, but CO2 is a weak acid when dissolved in water as carbonic acid). Hmm, but in this case, F would be a strong acid and G a weak acid. So, if C is Na2CO3, then C + H2O → 2 NaOH (strong base, not acid) + CO2. Wait, but the problem says the products are A, F, and G as acids. So that doesn't fit because NaOH is a base.

Hmm, perhaps C is a sulfate. For example, Na2SO4. When it reacts with water, it would form 2 NaOH and H2SO4? No, that's not right. Na2SO4 is neutral, and dissolving in water would just dissociate into 2 Na+ and SO4^2-.

Wait, another angle: F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So, perhaps C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. Then, when it reacts with water, it could hydrolyze into NaOH (strong base) and H2SO3 (which is a weak acid). But that's not two acids; one base and one acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester or something else, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, maybe C is a nitride. For example, NH4NO3 (ammonium nitrate). When it reacts with water, it decomposes into NH4OH (a weak acid, maybe?) and HNO3 (strong acid). Hmm, that could fit. So, NH4NO3 + H2O → NH4OH + HNO3. But NH4NO3 is a salt, and when it reacts with water, it might not decompose like that. I'm not sure about the exact reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfamide or another compound with two different acid-forming groups.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed salt, like something with both SO4^2- and SO3^2- ions, but that's probably not.

Alternatively, maybe C is a peroxide. For example, H2O2. When it decomposes, it forms H2O (neutral) and O2 (gas). But that doesn't give two acids.

Hmm, I'm stuck on this. Maybe I should think about E's structure and see which symmetry group fits.

If E is a diatomic molecule, it's D∞h. If it's a linear triatomic, also D∞h. If it's a bent triatomic, like H2O, then C2v.

Wait, what if E is O3? Ozone is a triatomic molecule with a bent structure. Its point group is D3h, which isn't one of the options. So that's not helpful.

What about SO2? It's a bent triatomic with a C2v symmetry. So if E is SO2, its symmetry group is C2v (option D).

But how would E be formed? Let's think.

C reacts with D to form E. If E is SO2, then perhaps C is something like S8 (but S8 is cyclic) or another sulfur compound. Then, D could be O2. So, C (maybe S) plus O2 → SO2. But the reaction would be S + O2 → SO2. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Wait, in reaction 2, C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. If D is O2, then 2 moles of O2 would react with C to form E. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps E is CO2. So, C would be something that reacts with D (maybe another gas like O2) to form CO2. For example, if C is CO (carbon monoxide), and D is O2, then CO + O2 → CO2. But that reaction requires a catalyst and is an oxidation. But the stoichiometry would be 1 CO per O2 to produce 1 CO2. So that would require 1 mole of O2 for 1 mole of CO, but the problem says 2 equivalents of D. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonate, and D is HCl. Then, C + HCl → CO2 + metal chloride. But then, E would be CO2, which is linear, so symmetry group D∞h (option C).

Alternatively, perhaps C is CaCO3, D is HCl. Then, CaCO3 + 2 HCl → CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O. So E is CO2, which is linear, D∞h.

But wait, the problem states that when C reacts with water, it forms A, F, and G. If C is CaCO3, then CaCO3 + H2O → Ca(OH)2 (a strong base) + CO2 (which in water forms a weak acid). But that wouldn't fit because F and G are both acids. So that's a problem.

Hmm.

Wait, going back to reaction 4: D + B → H (a solvent). If H is a common solvent, like water, ethanol, etc.

If H is water, then D and B must react to form H2O.

So, what reaction of D and B in a 1:1 ratio forms water as a product?

One possibility is 2 H2O + O2 → 2 H2O (no reaction, that's not helpful). Alternatively, 2 H2O → O2 + 2 H2 (electrolysis), but that's a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2 and B is O2. Then, 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. The ratio here is 2 H2 : 1 O2 → 2 H2O. So the ratio of D to B is 2:1, but the problem states a 1:1 ratio. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, another reaction: Maybe D is CO2 and B is H2O. But that's not a reaction; they might just dissolve.

Alternatively, perhaps D is NH3 and B is HCl. Then, NH3 + HCl → NH4Cl. But that's a 1:1 ratio. So H would be NH4Cl, which is a salt, not a solvent. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps H is ethanol. Then, D and B would need to react to form ethanol. For example, if B is O2 and D is something else, but I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit too complicated. Maybe I should summarize what I have so far.

Assuming E is a linear molecule, its symmetry group is D∞h. If E is something like CO2 or O2, that fits.

But how does E get formed?

Let me think again about reaction 2: C + 2 D → E.

If E is O2, then C + 2 D → O2. But O2 is a gas, and C is a bright red product. Hmm, maybe C is a compound that upon reaction with D (like H2O) releases O2.

Wait, perhaps C is H2O2. Then, H2O2 → H2O + O2. But that's decomposition, not a reaction with D. Not helpful.

Alternatively, if C is KClO3, and D is H2SO4. Then, KClO3 + H2SO4 → K2SO4 + H2O + ClO2↑ (but I'm not sure about the products). ClO2 is a brown gas, but maybe not fitting the description.

Wait, another thought: C could be a dichromate, like K2Cr2O7. When it reacts with D (maybe H2O), but that doesn't form O2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps E is O3. Then, how would C and D react to form O3? That seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe E is H2O. But that's a solvent, and the problem says E is extremely hazardous. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps E is HCN, which is highly toxic. HCN has a linear structure, so its point group is D∞h. So HCN would fit option C.

But how would HCN be formed? If C is something like CH3CN (acetonitrile) and D is H2O. No, that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a cyanide salt, and D is an acid. For example, NaCN + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + HCN↑ + H2O. In this case, E would be HCN, which is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry.

So, let me see if this fits with the other reactions.

Reaction 1: A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C (bright red). Suppose A is Na, and B is Cl2. Then, 8 Cl2 would be 4 molecules (since each is diatomic). So, 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. But that's 1 mole of Cl2 per 2 moles of Na. So 8 equivalents would mean 4 moles of Cl2, producing 8 moles of NaCl. So C would be NaCl, but NaCl is white, not red. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe A is Cu, and B is S. Cu + S → CuS? But CuS is dark, not red. Alternatively, perhaps A is Fe, and B is S. Fe + S → FeS, which is black. Not bright red.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe A is Ag, and B is NO. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the first reaction wrong. Let's think about a reaction where A (solid) reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form a bright red product C. What's a bright red solid I know of? Maybe mercury(II) oxide is red, but HgO is typically red. So, if A is Hg and B is O2, then 2 Hg + O2 → 2 HgO. So, 2 Hg + 1 O2 → 2 HgO. So, that's a 1:1 ratio of O2 to Hg. But the problem says 8 equivalents of B, so 8 moles. Hmm, that would require 8 moles of O2, which would produce 16 moles of HgO. That seems excessive, but perhaps the reaction occurs in a certain way.

So, C would be HgO, which is a bright red solid. Then, reaction 3: C (HgO) reacts with water to form A (Hg), plus two acids. But HgO is an oxide, so when it reacts with water, it would form HgO·H2O, which is a mercury hydroxide. Hmm, but that doesn't produce two acids. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is PbO2, which is dark brown, not red. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide. Maybe As2S3 is bright red. So, if A is As and B is S, then As + S → As2S3. But As is a metalloid, and S is a non-metal. The reaction would need to be in a gaseous form, perhaps. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry. Also, As2S3 wouldn't fit reaction 3, since reacting with water would produce H2S (a weak acid) and perhaps another acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but maybe another form is red. Alternatively, perhaps it's a vanadium compound, but I'm not certain.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to think about each reaction step by step.

Reaction 1:

A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red)

Reaction 2:

C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous)

Reaction 3:

C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)

Reaction 4:

D + B → H (solvent) in 1:1 ratio.

So, from reaction 3, C reacts with H2O to give A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So, C must be an anhydride or a compound that releases two different acids upon hydrolysis.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a sulfite, like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it might hydrolyze into NaOH (strong base) and H2SO3 (weak acid). But that would produce a base and an acid, not two acids. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide. Let's say C is H2O2. Then, H2O2 + H2O → 2 H2O (neutral) and O2 (gas). Doesn't fit, as no acids are formed.

Hmm. Maybe C is a mixed carbonate and another salt. I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about F and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. For example, HNO3 (strong) and H2CO3 (weak). Or H2SO4 (strong) and HNO2 (weak). How could C, when reacted with water, produce these?

Suppose C is a nitrate and a carbonate. For example, (NH4)2CO3·(NH4)NO3. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitro compound, but that's probably not.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfonate ester. For example, if C is something like RSO3H, which upon hydrolysis gives H2SO4 (strong acid) and some other acid. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound like (R-O)S(O)2(OH), but that's getting too complicated.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me go back to the E and its symmetry.

If E is a linear molecule, symmetry group is D∞h (option C). If it's a bent molecule, maybe C2v (option D).

Which of these is more likely given the options?

The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Another approach: Let's think about H, which is a solvent formed from D and B in a 1:1 ratio.

If H is H2O, then D and B must react to form H2O. What reactions form H2O in a 1:1 ratio between D and B?

One possibility is 2 H2O → O2 + 2 H2 (electrolysis), but that's a decomposition, not a synthesis.

Another possibility: B is H2 and D is O2. 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. The ratio is 2:1 H2 to O2, so not 1:1.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is CH4. CH4 + 2 O2 → CO2 + 2 H2O. The ratio is 1 CH4 : 2 O2, which again isn't 1:1.

Hmm, perhaps B is H2O and D is O2. Then, 2 H2O + O2 → 2 H2O (no reaction, that's not helpful).

Alternatively, perhaps B is CO2 and D is H2O. But I don't think they react under normal conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps B is NH3 and D is HCl. Then, NH3 + HCl → NH4Cl. But NH4Cl is a salt, not a solvent. Plus, the ratio is 1:1, which fits, but H is a solvent, so this doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: Maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2O. Then, Cl2 + H2O ⇌ 2 HCl + HOCl. So the ratio is 1 Cl2 : 1 H2O, but the product is HCl and HOCl. But H is a solvent, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Well, perhaps I've spent enough time thinking through this. Based on the information given, the most likely scenario is that E is a linear molecule, so its symmetry group is D∞h, which is option C.

The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the identification of the molecular symmetry group of product E. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The bright red color suggests C could be a compound like HgO (mercury(II) oxide) or a sulfur-containing compound, though the exact identity of A and B remains unclear.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, described as extremely hazardous. This suggests E could be a highly toxic compound, such as phosgene (COCl₂) or HCN (hydrogen cyanide), which are linear molecules.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This indicates C is likely an anhydride or a compound capable of forming two acids upon hydrolysis. For example, if C were a sulfite or nitride, it could produce a strong acid (like H₂SO₄) and a weak acid (like H₂CO₃).

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This suggests D and B could be gases like H₂ and O₂, respectively, forming H₂O as a solvent. However, the exact identity of D and B remains ambiguous.

To determine the molecular symmetry group of E:
- If E is a linear molecule (e.g., CO₂, HCN, or O₂), its symmetry group is **D∞h**.
- If E is a bent molecule (e.g., H₂O or SO₂), its symmetry group is **C₂v**.
- Given the options and the description of E as extremely hazardous, a linear molecule like HCN or CO₂ is more plausible, as these are known to be toxic and have **D∞h** symmetry.

Thus, based on the analysis, the molecular symmetry group of E is **D∞h**.
