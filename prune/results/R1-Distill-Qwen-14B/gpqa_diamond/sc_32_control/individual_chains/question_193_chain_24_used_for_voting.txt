Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about how the number of stars changes with distance. Hmm, let me try to work through it.

The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the formula is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Parallax, plx, is related to distance. I remember that parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Wait, no—actually, parallax in parsecs is equal to 1 over the distance in parsecs. So if distance r increases, parallax decreases.

So if plx is inversely proportional to distance, then plx = 1/(some constant * distance). Let me think. Let's say plx = 1/(distance) because distance is in parsecs. So for a given region, the number of stars depends on how many stars are present within that region as you look further out.

The given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Substituting plx as 1/r (assuming r is the distance), then N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's compute that. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 divided by that is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range. Oh, right, the question is asking for the change in the number of stars per unit distance, dN/dr or something like that.

Wait, no. The question says, "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So perhaps it's the differential: the rate of change of number with distance. Or maybe it's the number density, the number per unit volume, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let's clarify. The number of stars in a region depends on the volume, but stars are spread out. So when you look at a certain volume, the number of stars you see depends on how many are in that volume. The volume depends on distance. Let's think about a shell at distance r with thickness dr. The volume of that shell would be 4πr² dr. But the number of stars in that shell would depend on the density and the volume.

Wait, but the problem states that N varies as 1/(plx)^5. Let me see. Since plx is 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars up to a certain distance r is proportional to r^5. But wait, that might not make sense. Because normally, the number of stars you can see up to a distance r would depend on the volume, which is proportional to r³. Hmm, but the question is about the number of stars varying as 1/plx^5, not the number density.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again. The problem says that the number of stars in a specific region varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. So N = k / (plx)^5, where k is a constant. And since plx = 1/r, substituting that in, N = k * r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So as the distance increases, the number of stars increases as r to the fifth power. 

But the question is about how the number changes with distance. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars increases rapidly as distance increases. Now, the options are A) r^3, B) r^5, C) r^4, D) r^2. So the correct answer would be B) r^5.

Wait, is that right? Because if N is proportional to r^5, then for each unit increase in r, the number increases by a factor of r^5. So the number of stars increases as r^5. So the answer is B.

But wait, why would the number of stars increase so rapidly? Normally, the number of stars you can observe would be limited by the volume, which goes as r^3. But in this question, the relation given is different. So perhaps in this specific region, the number of stars is higher at larger distances, but that's not typical. But the question is just about the given relation, not about typical scenarios.

So the given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, which translates to N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars increases with r^5. Therefore, the correct answer is option B.

The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), such that \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this into the given relation, we find:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5
\]

This means the number of stars in the region is proportional to \( r^5 \). The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, \( r \)). Since \( N \propto r^5 \), the number of stars increases as \( r^5 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) \( \sim r^3 \)**  
**B) \( \sim r^5 \)**  
**C) \( \sim r^4 \)**  
**D) \( \sim r^2 \)**  

The correct choice is **B**, as the number of stars increases with \( r^5 \).

Answer: B
