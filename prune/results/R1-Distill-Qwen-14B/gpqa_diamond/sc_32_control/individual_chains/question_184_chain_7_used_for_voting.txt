Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to make 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let me think.

First, I remember that substituting benzene rings usually involves electrophilic substitution reactions. The order in which substituents are added matters because directing groups can influence where the next substitution occurs.

The target molecule has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Let me note their positions. The numbering is such that the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So it's 1-ethoxy, 2-t-Bu, 3-nitro.

Wait, benzene is symmetric, so numbering can vary. But the substituents are in specific positions, so I need to think about their directing effects.

Nitro groups are meta-directing and deactivating. Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. The tert-butyl group is a bulky, activating, ortho/para-directing group because it's an alkyl substituent.

Wait, but the substituents are in positions 1,2,3. So, let me imagine the benzene ring: positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent. So, the substituents are in a row—like 1 is ethoxy, 2 is t-Bu, 3 is nitro.

Wait, but how can they be adjacent? Benzene is a ring, so positions 1, 2, and 3 are consecutive. So it's meta to each other? Or adjacent in a line.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure. Let's see: the benzene ring has three substituents. Let me number them such that ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at position 3, and t-Bu at 2. Wait, but then the substituents are adjacent in a way that 1 and 2 are ortho, 2 and 3 are adjacent, but 1 and 3 are meta.

I'm getting a bit confused, so let me think about the synthesis steps.

To get all three groups, I need to perform three substitution reactions. But the order matters because each substituent can direct the next.

Since nitro is a strong deactivating group, I probably don't want to add that last because it would deactivate the ring, making further substitution harder. Or wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I can add the activating groups first, which can then be followed by the nitro group.

Wait, the target molecule has nitro group at position 3. So if I add nitro first, the next substituents would have to go in positions that are meta to nitro, but that's a deactivating group so it's harder. Alternatively, adding nitro last might be better.

So perhaps the strategy is to first add the ethoxy group, then the tert-butyl group, and then the nitro group. Or maybe another order.

Wait, but each substitution requires activating the ring. Let me think about how each substituent is introduced.

Adding substituents in the correct order requires that each step is feasible. Let's think about each substituent:

1. Ethoxy group: This can be introduced via an ether formation, like using ethyl chloride with a Lewis acid catalyst, or perhaps via nitration and then reduction. Wait, no. Wait, benzene can be nitrated, then reduced to an amine, then converted to an ether. But that's a possible approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using Friedel-Crafts. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation is tricky with benzene, more with toluene derivatives. Wait, for ethoxy, maybe it's better to do a nucleophilic substitution, but benzene isn't nucleophilic. So perhaps introducing via an electrophilic substitution.

Wait, wait. To introduce an ethoxy group, one common method is to perform a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that typically requires activating groups. Alternatively, perhaps we can introduce it via a substitution after activating the ring.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a methylation and then something else. No, perhaps using a nucleophilic group. Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the steps.

Wait, another approach: maybe the ethoxy group is introduced using a substitution reaction. But benzene is not very reactive in such reactions. Alternatively, perhaps using a directing group. Let's think about the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps we can introduce the ethoxy group via a substitution of a nitro group. Let me think, but that would require the nitro group to be present first.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to introduce the tert-butyl group first, then nitro, then ethoxy. Or another order.

Wait, let me think about each substituent and their directing effects.

The ethoxy group is activating and ortho/para-directing. So, once present, it would direct incoming electrophiles to ortho or para positions.

The t-Bu group is activating, ortho/para-directing as well.

The nitro group is deactivating and meta-directing.

So, when adding substituents, the activating groups make the ring more reactive and direct incoming groups accordingly.

So, let's think about the target molecule: positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), 3 (nitro). So, the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to the t-Bu (position 2) and the ethoxy (position 1). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added last. Because adding a nitro group after the ethoxy and t-Bu groups would be challenging since the ring is already activated, but nitro deactivates it.

Wait, but in the target molecule, the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to the t-Bu and ethoxy. So, the order of addition must allow for the nitro to be placed correctly.

Let me try to plan the steps.

Option 1: Add ethoxy first.

So, benzene → ethoxybenzene.

Then, add t-Bu group. But where? Ethoxy is ortho/para directing. So, adding t-Bu in either ortho or para position to ethoxy.

But the target has the t-Bu at position 2, ethoxy at 1. So, if ethoxy is at position 1, t-Bu will be at position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy. So, that's possible.

So, first step: introduce ethoxy group.

Second step: introduce t-Bu group ortho to ethoxy.

Third step: introduce nitro group meta to ethoxy, but in the target, it's at position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu.

Wait, but after adding ethoxy and t-Bu in the ortho positions, the ring might be more activated, allowing nitration in a specific position.

Wait, when you have two substituents on the ring, the positions are determined by the combined directing effects. So, the t-Bu and ethoxy are both activating, ortho/para directors.

If ethoxy is at position 1, t-Bu at 2, then where would the next substituent go?

The next substituent would be directed by the most powerful director. Both ethoxy and t-Bu are activating, but ethoxy is a stronger activating group (since it's an -O-R group). So, the nitration would be directed by the ethoxy group.

Wait, but the nitro group is a meta director, so if we add it after the ethoxy and t-Bu, where would it go?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group should be introduced earlier.

Wait, here's another approach. Let me consider the steps each option presents and see which one leads to the correct substituents in the correct positions.

Looking at the options, each has a series of steps. Let me analyze each option's steps.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride / AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation: adds t-Bu to benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → something like hydrolysis or acid workup.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy group via SN2 (like Williamson).

viii) Fe/HCl → reduction?

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration.

Wait, but the target only has one nitro group. So if this option does multiple nitrations, maybe it's incorrect.

Option B:

i) t-Bu via AlCl3.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction of nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3 again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+/H2O/heat: hydrolysis to nitro or something else.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy substitution.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → desulfonation?

Not sure, but seems complicated.

Option C:

i) t-Bu via AlCl3.

ii) SO3 → sulfonation.

iii) HNO3 → nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3 again.

vii) H3O+/H2O/heat.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Hmm, multiple steps, including sulfonation and desulfonation possibly.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrate benzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) t-Bu via AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts, but wait, after nitro is reduced to amine, which is a strong activating group. So FC would be possible.

iv) HNO3 again → nitration.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) SO3 → sulfonation.

vii) dilute H2SO4.

viii) H3O+/H2O/heat.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy.

Wait, but let me think. Option D starts with nitration of benzene to get nitrobenzene. Then, Fe/HCl would reduce nitro to amine, giving aniline. Then, t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts. But wait, aniline is strongly activating, so FC alkylation is possible.

Wait, but FC alkylation usually requires a catalyst like AlCl3, but maybe in this case, the conditions are different.

Wait, but after aniline, adding t-Bu would go into the ring. Where? Aniline is a strong activating, ortho/para director. So the t-Bu would go ortho or para to the amine.

But then, step iv is another nitration. Aniline is present, which is a strong activator, so nitration would occur.

Wait, but the target has nitro at position 3. Let me think about the order.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to introduce the ethoxy group first, then t-Bu, then nitro. Let me think about that.

But how to introduce ethoxy? Because benzene isn't directly reactive towards that. Wait, maybe by introducing a nitro group first, then converting it to an amine, then substituting with ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps that's a way: nitrate benzene, reduce to amine, then substitute the amine with ethoxy group.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think about each substituent again.

The target has three substituents: ethoxy (1), t-Bu (2), nitro (3).

So, the positions are 1,2,3. So, ethoxy at 1, t-Bu at 2 (ortho to ethoxy), and nitro at 3 (meta to ethoxy, but adjacent to t-Bu).

Wait, but after adding ethoxy and t-Bu, adding nitro could be challenging because the ring is activated, but nitro is deactivating.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add ethoxy, then t-Bu, then nitro.

So, ethoxy is introduced first. How? Maybe via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps using a directing group. Let's say, nitrate benzene, then reduce to amine, then substitute with ethoxy. Wait, but that would require the nitro group to be in a position that allows for the ethoxy to be added ortho or para.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but benzene isn't very reactive for that. Wait, but with a strong activating group, maybe.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about each option step by step.

Looking at option D:

Steps:

i. Nitration: benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii. Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to NH2 (aniline).

iii. t-Bu via AlCl3 → so aniline is an activating group, so FC alkylation would occur. So adding t-Bu to aniline.

Aniline is ortho/para directing, so the t-Bu would be added in ortho or para position to the amine.

Let me imagine the ring: nitro was at position 1 (assuming it's the first substituent). Then, reduction to NH2 at position 1. Then, adding t-Bu via FC. So, t-Bu could be at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para) relative to NH2.

But then, step iv is nitration again. So, after adding t-Bu, the ring has NH2 (position 1) and t-Bu (position 2 or 4). Then, nitration would happen where?

NH2 is a strong activating, ortho/para director. So, when we nitrate again, the new nitro group would go ortho or para to NH2. But where is the t-Bu? If it's at position 2, then the positions taken are 1 (NH2), 2 (t-Bu), and the possible nitrations would be at positions 3 (ortho to NH2) or 5 (para).

Wait, but in the target, nitro is at position 3. So, if the second nitration is at position 3, that would fit. But wait, the t-Bu is at position 2. So, position 3 is adjacent to t-Bu. But the nitro is a meta director, so if t-Bu is present, but the ring is activated by NH2, which is a stronger director, perhaps nitration occurs at position 3, which is ortho to the NH2 group.

So after the second nitration, positions 1 (NH2), 2 (t-Bu), 3 (NO2) would be occupied.

Then, step v is NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. So, the NH2 group is converted to a diazonium salt.

Then, step vi is SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation, perhaps introducing a sulfonic acid group. But wait, that might complicate things.

Step vii is dilute H2SO4 → maybe hydrolysis or desulfonation.

Step viii: H3O+/H2O/Heat → perhaps acid workup.

Step ix: NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy substitution.

Wait, but where would the ethoxy group go? It depends on the substituents present.

Alternatively, perhaps after the diazonium salt is formed, it's treated under certain conditions to substitute the group.

Wait, let me think again. So after step iv, we have nitro groups at 1 and 3, and t-Bu at 2.

Wait, no, step iv is the second nitration. So, the first substituent is nitro at position 1. Then, reduction gives NH2 at 1. Then, t-Bu is added, say at position 2. Then, nitration at position 3.

So, the substituents are at 1 (NH2), 2 (t-Bu), 3 (NO2).

Then, step v: diazotization converts the NH2 at 1 to a diazonium chloride. Then, step vi: sulfonation. Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe the diazonium group is then replaced.

Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium group is treated with something else. Then, step vii is dilute H2SO4, which might decompose the diazonium group.

In any case, step ix is treatment with NaOH and ethyl bromide, which is a typical Williamson-type substitution. But where would that occur?

Wait, after the NH2 group is replaced, perhaps the ring has a nitro group, a t-Bu group, and a diazonium group which is then replaced. Or maybe the substitution occurs in a position where the ethoxy can be added.

This is getting quite complex. Alternatively, perhaps option D isn't the right path.

Let me think about another approach. To introduce the ethoxy group, perhaps it's introduced via a substitution reaction, which requires a good leaving group. For example, if there's a nitro group in a position that can be replaced with ethoxy, but that might require specific conditions.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which typically requires a strongly activating group. So, perhaps after introducing the nitro group and t-Bu, but that seems tricky.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a sulfonic acid group which can be replaced. So, via a sulfonyl group, which can be substituted with ethoxy.

Wait, I'm getting a bit lost. Let me look at the target molecule again: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, substituents at 1, 2, and 3.

So, the order of adding substituents should allow each new group to be added in the correct position relative to the existing groups.

Perhaps, first add the ethoxy group, then the t-Bu, then the nitro.

But how to add ethoxy? Maybe via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but benzene isn't very reactive. Wait, but if we have a directing group, like a nitro group, but that's deactivating.

Alternatively, perhaps use a nitration, then reduction, then substitution.

Wait, here's an idea: 

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce the nitro group to an amine → aniline.

3. Substitute the amine with ethoxy group → using something like diazotization and then substituting with ethoxy. Wait, but that's not straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps using a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, I remember that when you have an aryl amine, you can convert it to a diazonium salt and then substitute it with an ethoxy group under certain conditions, like with a good nucleophile.

So, step 1: benzene → nitrobenzene.

Step 2: nitro → amine (aniline).

Step 3: aniline → diazonium chloride.

Step 4: diazonium treated with, say, NaOH and ethyl bromide. Wait, but that's not the right condition. Alternatively, diazonium could be treated with ethanol under heat, but that typically gives a substitution with OH, not OEt.

Wait, perhaps using a Williamson-type approach. But the ethoxy group would have to come from an alkoxide. So, maybe using NaOEt and a good leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps after forming the diazonium, we can perform a substitution with ethanol in a basic condition. But I'm not sure if that's standard.

Alternatively, perhaps use a different approach. Let's suppose the ethoxy group is added via Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts ether synthesis is tricky because it's not as direct as alkylation. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced as a nucleophile after activating the ring with substituents.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to think about each option's steps.

Looking back at option D:

After nitration, reduction, t-Bu alkylation, nitration again, etc. Maybe the final substitution is introducing ethoxy.

Wait, in option D, the last step is NaOH/EtBr, which is a typical condition for an SN2 substitution. So, perhaps in that step, an ethoxy group is introduced where a good leaving group is present.

But where would that leaving group be? Maybe on the benzene ring.

Wait, perhaps after multiple substitutions, the ring has a leaving group, such as a nitro group, which is replaced by ethoxy. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution of a nitro group. But that would require the nitro group to be in a position where substitution is feasible, which usually requires a strong activating group.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that requires the ring to be activated. So, if the ring has a t-Bu group (activating), then the ethoxy could be added via FC, but wait, ethoxy is not an alkylating agent for FC. FC is for alkyl halides, not ethers.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an Ullmann or Suzuki coupling, but that's probably beyond the scope of this question.

Hmm, this is challenging. Let me recap the target structure.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So, substituents in positions 1, 2, 3.

The nitro group is at position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu (position 2) and ethoxy (position 1).

So, the ring looks like:

Positions 1: ethoxy

Position 2: t-Bu

Position 3: nitro

So, the substituents are in a row. So, the order of adding the substituents must allow each new group to be added in the correct position.

Perhaps the best way is to add the nitro group last because the ring will be activated by the ethoxy and t-Bu groups, making nitration feasible.

So, the order could be ethoxy → t-Bu → nitro.

But how to add ethoxy first. Let me think about that.

To introduce ethoxy group, perhaps via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that requires a strong activating group. Alternatively, perhaps via a directing group.

Wait, perhaps first nitrate benzene to get nitro group, then reduce it to an amine, then substitute the amine with ethoxy. But where would that ethoxy go?

Wait, let me think step by step.

1. Benzene → nitrate → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitrobenzene to aniline: nitro → NH2.

3. Now, aniline is a strong activating group, so we can perform Friedel-Crafts alkylation to introduce t-Bu.

Wait, but FC alkylation is for alkyl halides. So, t-Bu chloride with AlCl3 as catalyst. So, aniline (strongly activating) would direct the t-Bu group to ortho or para positions.

Suppose the t-Bu is introduced at position 2 (ortho to NH2 at position 1).

So, now ring has NH2 (1) and t-Bu (2).

4. Now, introduce ethoxy group. How? Perhaps via a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, but the ring isn't activated enough for that. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a directing group.

Alternatively, perhaps perform a second nitration, but aniline is present, which is a strong director.

Wait, but the nitro group is a deactivating group, so adding it would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution of the NH2 group. But that might require converting NH2 to a diazonium salt and then substituting with ethoxy.

So:

After step 3, ring has NH2 (1) and t-Bu (2).

Step 4: Diazotize NH2 → diazonium at 1.

Step 5: Replace the diazonium group with ethoxy. How? Using NaOH and ethyl bromide, perhaps. Or via a coupling reaction.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right condition. Alternatively, perhaps using a nucleophilic substitution with ethanol in basic conditions.

But perhaps another approach: after forming the diazonium, introduce a leaving group. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction after the NH2 group is converted into a better leaving group.

But this is getting too vague. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option C:

i) t-Bu via AlCl3.

ii) SO3 → sulfonation.

iii) HNO3 → nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3 again.

vii) H3O+/H2O/heat.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr.

I'm not sure about the sequence here. It seems to involve sulfonation and nitration steps, which might complicate the positions.

Alternatively, let's think about option A:

The steps are:

i) t-Bu via AlCl3 → benzene becomes t-Bu benzene.

ii) HNO3 → nitration.

iii) SO3 → sulfonation.

iv) NaNO2 → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+/H2O/heat → maybe hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy substitution.

viii) Fe/HCl → reduction.

ix) HNO3 → nitration.

Wait, this seems to have multiple nitrations and sulfonations, which might not lead to the correct product.

Option B:

i) t-Bu.

ii) HNO3.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3 again.

v) NaNO2.

vi) H3O+/H2O.

vii) NaOH/EtBr.

viii) SO3.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

Hmm, perhaps after some steps, the substituents are added in the right order.

Wait, let me think about the correct order.

If the target has ethoxy, t-Bu, and nitro, perhaps ethoxy is added via a substitution after activating the ring.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after the ring has a nitro group.

Wait, but nitro is deactivating, so that's difficult. So, perhaps the correct order is to add the activating groups first, then the deactivating.

So, first ethoxy, then t-Bu, then nitro.

But how to add ethoxy first. Let me think about that.

Introducing ethoxy via a substitution:

1. Benzene → introduce a nitro group in a position that can be replaced later.

Wait, perhaps first nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

Then, reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

Then, substitute the amine with ethoxy → but how?

Another approach: perhaps nitrate benzene, then introduce a leaving group, then substitute with ethoxy.

Wait, but the steps need to be sequential.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction, which requires the ring to have a good leaving group.

But benzene doesn't have good leaving groups. So, perhaps after introducing a nitro group, which can be reduced to an amine, then the amine can be converted into a diazonium salt, which can be a good leaving group under certain conditions.

So, the steps could be:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Diazotize aniline → diazonium chloride.

4. Substitute diazonium with ethoxy → using NaOH and ethyl bromide? Or via another method.

But I'm not sure about the specifics. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts after activating the ring with another group.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation requires an alkyl halide and a Lewis acid. So, to introduce ethoxy via FC, I'd need an ether, but that's not typically how FC works.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires a strongly activating group. So, if we have a nitro group already, that isn't helpful. Alternatively, having a hydroxyl group could activate the ring.

Wait, perhaps another approach:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Introduce t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts → t-Bu group added.

4. Then, introduce ethoxy group via substitution on the amine.

Wait, but after adding t-Bu, the ring has aniline and t-Bu. Then, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via substitution of the amine.

But I'm not sure about the conditions for that substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution of a nitro group, but that's not feasible under normal conditions.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck on the initial steps. Let me think about the target substituents and their positions again. The ethoxy is at position 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3. So, positions 1,2,3 are all adjacent.

That makes me think that when each substituent is added, the position is determined by the existing groups.

If we add the nitro group last, the ring would be activated by the ethoxy and t-Bu, making nitration feasible.

So, the order could be:

1. Introduce ethoxy.

2. Introduce t-Bu.

3. Introduce nitro.

So, how to introduce ethoxy first.

Another thought: perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution of a nitro group. So first nitrate benzene, then reduce to amine, then substitute with ethoxy.

Wait, but that would require the ethoxy to be introduced in the position where the nitro was. Let me think.

After nitration and reduction, you have aniline. Then, substitute the amine with ethoxy. That would mean the ethoxy is at position 1.

Then, add t-Bu: since ethoxy is an activating group, it would direct t-Bu to ortho or para. So t-Bu would be at position 2 or 4.

Then, nitrate the ring: ethoxy is a strong director, so nitro would go para to ethoxy. But in the target, nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu at 2.

Wait, perhaps the nitration occurs where?

Wait, after ethoxy is at 1 and t-Bu at 2, the nitration would be directed by ethoxy, which is ortho/para. So, possible positions are 3 (ortho to ethoxy) and 4 (para).

But in the target, nitro is at position 3, which is ortho to ethoxy and adjacent to t-Bu at 2.

So, that seems correct.

So, the steps would be:

1. Introduce ethoxy at position 1.

2. Introduce t-Bu at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy).

3. Nitrate at position 3 (ortho to ethoxy, meta to t-Bu? Or maybe it's para to something else? Wait, t-Bu is at 2, ethoxy at 1, so position 3 is adjacent to both. So, when nitrating, the ethoxy directs to ortho (positions 2 and 6?), but position 2 is already taken by t-Bu, so the nitro goes to position 3 as the next available ortho position.

So, that seems plausible.

But how to introduce ethoxy first.

Wait, to introduce ethoxy at position 1, perhaps via a substitution reaction after introducing a nitro group.

So, steps:

1. Benzene → nitrate to get nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Substitute amine with ethoxy → ethoxy group at position 1.

4. Now, ring has ethoxy at 1. Then, introduce t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts → t-Bu at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy).

5. Then, nitrate the ring → nitro at position 3 (ortho to ethoxy).

So, the target is achieved.

Now, how to perform each step.

Step 1: Nitration → HNO3/H2SO4.

Step 2: Reduction → Fe/HCl (reduces nitro to amine).

Step 3: Substitute amine with ethoxy. How? Diazotization and substitution.

So, step 3: diazotize aniline → NaNO2/HCl, then substitute with ethoxy.

But how? The usual substitution is with a nucleophile. So, perhaps using NaOH and ethyl bromide? Or maybe using an ether in a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, when you have a diazonium salt, you can substitute it with a nucleophile. So, perhaps the ethoxy group comes from ethanol, but that's usually under acidic conditions, which might not give the desired substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps using NaOH and ethyl bromide, which is a good nucleophile.

So, step 3: diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) → then treatment with EtBr and NaOH → SN2 substitution, replacing the diazonium group with ethoxy.

Wait, that's plausible. Diazonium salt is a good leaving group, and in basic conditions, the ethoxide ion (from EtBr) would attack.

But wait, EtBr is a primary alkyl bromide, which is a good leaving group. But in substitution, perhaps the ethoxide would come from NaOEt.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps using NaOH and EtBr would provide the ethoxide nucleophile.

So, in step 3: after diazotization, treat with NaOH and EtBr. The diazonium group is replaced with ethoxy.

Then, step 4: introduce t-Bu via FC alkylation.

But wait, the ring now has ethoxy (activating), so FC alkylation would add t-Bu in ortho or para to ethoxy.

So, t-Bu would be added at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para).

But in the target, t-Bu is at 2, adjacent to ethoxy at 1. So, that makes sense.

So, step 4: t-BuCl/AlCl3 → FC alkylation, adding t-Bu at position 2.

Then, step 5: nitrate the ring → ethoxy directs nitro group to ortho (positions 2 and 6) or para (4). Position 2 is taken by t-Bu, so nitro would go to position 3 (ortho to ethoxy, adjacent to t-Bu).

Wait, but position 3 is meta to t-Bu. Wait, no: t-Bu is at 2, so ortho positions are 1 and 3. But position 1 is ethoxy. So, when nitrating, the nitro group would go to position 3, which is ortho to ethoxy and adjacent to t-Bu at 2.

So, that fits the target.

So, the steps would be:

1. Nitrate benzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine.

3. Substitute amine with ethoxy.

4. FC alkylation to add t-Bu.

5. Nitrate again to add nitro.

Wait, but step 5 is the last step, right? Because the target has nitro at 3.

But according to the steps I thought, after adding t-Bu, the ring is activated, so nitration would occur.

So, the sequence would be:

i) Nitration,

ii) reduction,

iii) substitution with ethoxy,

iv) alkylation with t-Bu,

v) nitration again.

Looking at the options, which option follows this sequence?

Looking at option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrate.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce.

iii) t-Bu via AlCl3 → alkylation.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2 → diazotization.

vi) SO3 → sulfonation.

vii) dilute H2SO4.

viii) H3O+/H2O.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

Wait, but in my proposed sequence, after nitration, reduction, substitution, alkylation, and then nitration again. So, the steps would be:

Nitrate (i), reduce (ii), substitute (iii), alkylation (iv), nitrate (v).

But in option D, the steps are nitrate (i), reduce (ii), alkylation (iii), nitrate (iv), then diazotization (v), etc.

So, after alkylation (iii), they nitrate (iv). Then, what's next? Diazotization (v) → perhaps reducing or substituting something.

But the target has only one nitro group, so perhaps option D is not the right path.

Wait, but according to my proposed steps, after nitration (i), reduction (ii), substitution (iii), alkylation (iv), then nitration (v).

Looking at the options, perhaps option D's steps are:

i) nitrate,

ii) reduce,

iii) alkylation,

iv) nitrate again.

So, after that, we have the nitro group at position 3.

Wait, but then why would we need the rest of the steps?

Ah, because the target has ethoxy, t-Bu, and nitro, in positions 1, 2, 3.

In option D, after step iv (second nitration), the substituents are at positions 1 (NH2, reduced to amine?), 2 (t-Bu), 3 (NO2). Then, step v is diazotization, which converts the amine to diazonium. Then, step vi is sulfonation, perhaps adding a sulfonic acid group. But the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group.

Hmm, maybe option D is not correct.

Looking back at option B:

i) t-Bu via AlCl3.

ii) nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again.

v) diazotization.

vi) H3O+/H2O.

vii) NaOH/EtBr.

viii) SO3.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

This seems a bit convoluted. I'm not sure.

Another approach: perhaps the correct option is option D, because it starts with nitration, then reduction, which allows for adding substituents in the correct positions.

Wait, let me think about the steps in option D:

D:

i) HNO3 → nitro at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → NH2 at 1.

iii) t-Bu via AlCl3 → added ortho or para to NH2. Let's say position 2.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again. NH2 is a strong director, so nitro will go ortho or para. If NH2 is at 1, t-Bu at 2, then nitration would go to 4 (para) or 3 (ortho). But in the target, nitro is at 3.

So, after step iv, nitro is at 3.

v) NaNO2 → diazotize NH2 at 1.

vi) SO3 → sulfonate.

vii) dilute H2SO4 → desulfonate? Not sure.

viii) H3O+ → perhaps hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitute something with ethoxy.

Wait, but the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so perhaps step vi introduces it, and step vii removes it. That's possible.

So, after steps i to iv, substituents are NH2 (1), t-Bu (2), NO2 (3).

Step v: NH2 → diazonium.

Step vi: SO3 → sulfonate at position 1 (where NH2 was).

Step vii: dilute H2SO4 → desulfonate, leaving a leaving group (like a good leaving group, maybe a hydroxyl? But not sure).

Wait, but actually, when you sulfonate, you get a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which is a strong activating group. But then, desulfonation under acidic conditions might not do much.

Alternatively, perhaps after sulfonating, the ring has a sulfonic acid group at position 1, t-Bu at 2, and nitro at 3.

Then, step viii: H3O+ and heat → maybe hydrolysis or something else.

Step ix: NaOH and EtBr → perhaps SN2 substitution. Where would the substitution happen?

If the ring has a sulfonic acid group (activating), it would direct substitution to ortho and para. So, perhaps the ethoxy group is added at position 4 (para to sulfonic acid) or 6 (ortho).

But the target has ethoxy at position 1, which is where the sulfonic acid group is. So, perhaps this isn't the right path.

I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to approach this differently. Maybe the correct option is option D because it involves nitration, reduction, Friedel-Crafts, and then another nitration, which fits the necessary steps.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is required. Let me think about the substituents and their directing effects again.

The target has nitro (strong deactivating, meta), ethoxy (activating, ortho/para), and t-Bu (activating, ortho/para).

So, when adding the nitro group last, the ring would be activated by ethoxy and t-Bu, making nitration feasible in the correct position.

So, the order would be ethoxy → t-Bu → nitro.

The steps to achieve that:

1. Introduce ethoxy.

2. Introduce t-Bu.

3. Introduce nitro.

But how to introduce ethoxy first.

Let me think about each substituent's synthesis.

Ethoxy group introduction:

One method is to first nitrate benzene, then reduce to amine, then substitute the amine with ethoxy via diazonium salt formation and substitution.

So, steps:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro → aniline.

3. Diazotize aniline → diazonium.

4. Substitute diazonium with ethoxy → ethoxybenzene.

Then, introduce t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts.

t-Bu would go ortho or para to ethoxy.

Say, t-Bu at ortho (position 2).

Then, nitrate the ring → ethoxy directs to position 3 (ortho to ethoxy, adjacent to t-Bu).

So, that would give the target.

So, steps:

i. Nitration → nitro.

ii. Reduction → amine.

iii. Diazotization → diazonium.

iv. Substitution → ethoxy.

v. Friedel-Crafts → t-Bu.

vi. Nitration → nitro.

Looking at the options, which one has this sequence?

Looking at option D:

i) nitrate.

ii) reduce.

iii) t-Bu via FC.

iv) nitrate.

v) diazotize.

vi) sulfonate.

vii) dilute H2SO4.

viii) H3O+.

ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Hmm, but in my proposed sequence, after adding t-Bu and then nitro, the ethoxy is already in place. So, perhaps option D doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option D, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Let me think about that.

In option D, the steps are:

i) nitrate benzene → nitro.

ii) reduce to amine.

iii) t-Bu via FC → t-Bu added ortho to amine.

iv) nitrate → nitro added ortho to amine.

v) diazotize.

vi) sulfonate.

vii) dilute H2SO4.

viii) H3O+.

ix) NaOH/EtBr.

But after step iv, the ring has amine (position 1), t-Bu (position 2), and nitro (position 3).

Then, step v: diazotize amine → diazonium.

Step vi: sulfonate → where? Maybe at position 1.

Step vii: desulfonate? Or perhaps hydrolyze.

Step viii: H3O+ → maybe hydrolyze diazonium.

Step ix: NaOH/EtBr → substitute something with ethoxy.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy comes from substitution of the diazonium salt.

Wait, perhaps after step v (diazonium), the diazonium group is replaced with ethoxy via treatment with NaOH and EtBr. So, step ix does that.

But in option D, step ix is the last step, NaOH/EtBr. So, after the previous steps, perhaps the diazonium group is in place, and substitution gives ethoxy.

So, putting it all together:

After step iv, we have positions 1 (amine), 2 (t-Bu), 3 (nitro).

Step v: diazotize amine → position 1 becomes diazonium.

Step vi: sulfonate → not sure where.

Step vii: dilute H2SO4 → perhaps removes sulfonic acid.

Step viii: H3O+ → maybe acid workup.

Step ix: NaOH/EtBr → substitute diazonium with ethoxy.

So, after all steps, we have ethoxy at position 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3. Which matches the target.

So, the steps in option D would lead to the target.

Thus, the correct option is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must ensure that the substituents are introduced in the correct order to achieve the desired positions and directing effects. The target molecule has three substituents: an ethoxy group at position 1, a tert-butyl group at position 2, and a nitro group at position 3. The synthesis must account for the activating and deactivating effects of these groups and their directing behavior during subsequent substitutions.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
- Begins with the introduction of the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.
- Subsequent steps include nitration, sulfonation, diazotization, hydrolysis, and substitution with ethoxy.
- However, this sequence does not align with the target structure, as it involves multiple nitrations and sulfonations that do not lead to the correct substituent positions.

#### **Option B**:
- Introduces the tert-butyl group first, followed by nitration, reduction, and additional nitration steps.
- Includes diazotization, hydrolysis, substitution with ethoxy, sulfonation, and desulfonation.
- The sequence is convoluted and does not clearly lead to the correct substituent positions in the target molecule.

#### **Option C**:
- Starts with the tert-butyl group, followed by sulfonation, nitration, reduction, diazotization, and additional nitration steps.
- Ends with substitution with ethoxy and hydrolysis.
- The sequence involves multiple nitrations and sulfonations, which do not clearly result in the correct substituent arrangement.

#### **Option D**:
- Begins with nitration of benzene to introduce a nitro group at position 1.
- Reduces the nitro group to an amine, which is then used to introduce the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation at position 2 (ortho to the amine).
- A second nitration step introduces the nitro group at position 3 (ortho to the ethoxy group and adjacent to the tert-butyl group).
- The diazonium salt formed from the amine is replaced with the ethoxy group via substitution, resulting in the final structure.

### Conclusion:
Option D provides the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The steps ensure that the substituents are introduced in the correct order, accounting for their directing effects and leading to the desired product.
