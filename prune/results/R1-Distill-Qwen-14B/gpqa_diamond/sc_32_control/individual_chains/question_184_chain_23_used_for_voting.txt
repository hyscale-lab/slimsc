Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis pathways can be tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The question is asking which sequence of reactions will lead to the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence correctly builds the desired molecule.

First, let me draw the target molecule to visualize what's needed. The substituents on the benzene ring are:

- At position 1: ethoxy group (-OEt)
- At position 2: tert-butyl group (t-Bu)
- At position 3: nitro group (-NO2)

So the benzene ring has three substituents. Let me number them: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is t-Bu, and position 3 is nitro. Wait, wait. Wait, benzene is a ring, so numbering might be a bit off. Let me think. Let's imagine benzene as a hexagon with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. But wait, the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), and 3 (nitro). So that's a meta arrangement between the nitro and ethoxy, but actually, wait, let me check the actual structure.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So numbering starts with ethoxy at position 1, then position 2 is t-Bu, and position 3 is nitro. So, the substituents are all meta to each other? Wait, no. Let me draw it. If position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is t-Bu (adjacent), and position 3 is nitro (adjacent to t-Bu and across from ethoxy). So, it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene with substituents in adjacent positions.

Wait, that might not make sense. Let me think again. The positions are 1, 2, and 3 being adjacent. So, in a benzene ring, that would mean the substituents are all next to each other. But nitro groups are meta directors, ethoxy is activating, and t-Bu is a bulky group, perhaps a deactivating through induction but maybe not? Wait, t-Bu is a strong electron-donating group because it's an alkyl group, so it's activating. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the order of adding substituents. Because when adding multiple groups, the order in which you add them affects where each substituent goes, based on directing effects.

So, the target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, t-Bu, and nitro. Let's plan the steps for synthesizing it.

First, I'll consider that adding nitro groups can be challenging because nitration is a strong meta-directing group. But if I add the nitro group first, it might complicate adding the other groups. Alternatively, adding the activating groups first could be better because they can direct the incoming substituents.

But let me think about the target structure. It has ethoxy (OEt) at position 1, t-Bu at position 2, and nitro at position 3. Wait, no, the numbering is a bit confusing. Let me try to imagine the positions again. If substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, they are adjacent, so it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. So, the ethoxy is at position 1, t-Bu at 2, and nitro at 3. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in a way where the nitro is at a certain position relative to the others.

Alternatively, perhaps the order of adding substituents is important. Let's consider the possible steps:

Option D starts with nitration. So, step i is HNO3/H2SO4. So, benzene is nitrated to nitrobenzene. Then step ii is Fe/HCl, which is a reduction condition, but wait, Fe/HCl is typically for the Bechamp reaction, like converting nitro groups to amino. But in what context? Maybe a reduction of nitro to amine.

Wait, but let me check each option's steps.

Looking at the options, each has a series of steps, some of which are substitution reactions (like Friedel-Crafts), nitration, sulfonation, etc.

Wait, but the target molecule has ethoxy, t-Bu, and nitro groups. So, perhaps the steps involve introducing each substituent in a certain order. The ethoxy group can be introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or via an ether formation. For ethoxy, perhaps using a Williamson ether synthesis is an option, but that would require an alkoxide. Alternatively, using an alkyl halide with a strong Lewis acid catalyst like AlCl3.

Wait, but for Friedel-Crafts, the ethyl group would come from an ethyl chloride, perhaps. But wait, in the target, the ethoxy is at position 1. So, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution reaction after activating the ring.

But let me think about the directing effects. The order of adding substituents will determine where the next substituents go. For example, if I first add an activating group that is ortho/para directing, the next substituent will go into ortho or para positions. But if I add a deactivating group, that would change the directing.

Wait, but nitro groups are meta directors, while ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director. Similarly, t-Bu is a bulky, activating group, so it's ortho/para directing.

So, perhaps the strategy is to first add the ethoxy group, then the nitro, then the t-Bu. Or perhaps another order.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is at position 3, adjacent to t-Bu (position 2) and ethoxy (position 1). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is added after the ethoxy and t-Bu.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first, but that would make adding the other groups more difficult because nitro is deactivating and meta-directing. Let's think about that.

If I first nitrate benzene, I get nitrobenzene. Then, if I try to introduce ethoxy, since nitro is meta-directing, the next group would enter at the meta position relative to nitro. But then adding t-Bu would also be directed by the existing substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to add the activating groups first, which can then direct incoming groups into their positions.

Wait, the target has ethoxy at position 1, t-Bu at 2, and nitro at 3. So, perhaps the nitro is at the meta position relative to ethoxy. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach this methodically.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Wait, let me count the positions correctly. So, the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. The numbering is 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), and 3 (nitro). Therefore, the substituents are in adjacent positions, making a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

So, the structure is a benzene ring with substituents at three consecutive positions. Now, to synthesize this, the order of substituent addition is crucial because each new group will be directed by the existing substituents.

Let me think of possible orders:

1. Add ethoxy first. Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director. Then, add t-Bu, which is also activating and ortho/para. Then add nitro, which is deactivating and meta.

2. Alternatively, add t-Bu first. Then ethoxy, then nitro.

3. Or, add nitro first, then ethoxy, then t-Bu.

But adding nitro first would make the ring deactivating, making the subsequent substitutions harder. So perhaps it's better to add the activating groups first.

So, let's assume the order is ethoxy first, then t-Bu, then nitro.

Wait, but where would each group go? Let's simulate:

- Start with benzene.

- Step 1: Introduce ethoxy group. Using Friedel-Crafts, we can introduce ethoxy via an ether formation. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation or acylation. Oh wait, ethoxy is an ether, so perhaps introducing it via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution isn't straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps we can use an ethyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation and then convert it to ethoxy. Hmm, but that's not efficient. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced as a substituent through another method, like using an alkoxide.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 substitution, but that's not applicable to benzene. Alternatively, perhaps using a directing group. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced as an activating group via a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that would give an acetyl group, which is a meta director. Hmm, maybe that's not the way.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution using a good leaving group. But benzene itself isn't reactive enough for that. So, perhaps a better approach is to use a directing group and then substitute.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy can be introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation using ethyl chloride and AlCl3. Friedel-Crafts would add an ethyl group, but that's an alkyl group, giving a toluene derivative. Then, to make it an ethoxy, perhaps we can perform a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that requires a strong activating group, like a nitro group in the para position.

Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a different route. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced as a substituent using a meta-chloroethoxybenzene, but that's getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach this by looking at the options and their sequences.

Looking at the options, each has a sequence of reactions. Let's think about each option.

Option D: The steps are:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduction of nitro to amine? Or perhaps demethylation? Not sure.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

vii) dilute H2SO4 → perhaps hydrolysis.

viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → acid workup.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps ethoxy group via SN2 substitution.

Wait, this seems a bit off. Let me think step by step.

Wait, starting with benzene.

Step i: Nitration would add a nitro group. Let's say it goes in the para position? Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so the first nitration would give nitrobenzene (only possible product).

Then step ii: Fe/HCl. Fe in HCl is acidic conditions, maybe for reducing the nitro group to an amine. So nitrobenzene → phenylamine (but that would be in acidic conditions? Or maybe the amine is formed as the phenol? Wait, no. Nitrobenzene under Fe/HCl (like in the Bechamp reaction) would reduce the nitro group to an amine. So we get phenylamine.

Then step iii: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl. But wait, phenylamine is an activating group, but it's a strong activating group. However, Friedel-Crafts requires a Lewis acid catalyst, and an alkyl chloride. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation is usually done on aromatic rings that are activating. Phenylamine is a strong activating group, so perhaps the t-BuCl would undergo a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, when adding an alkyl group to an aryl amine, would that be feasible? I'm not sure. Because the ring is very activated, but the amine is a strong activating group. Alternatively, the ring might be too activated, leading to possible over-reaction or not the correct substitution pattern.

Wait, but if the nitro group was initially added, and then reduced to an amine, which is a strong activating group, then adding t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts could occur. But where would it add? The amine group is a strong activating, ortho/para director. So, the t-Bu would add either ortho, meta, or para to the amine. Wait, but in a benzene ring, the substituents can only be at certain positions. Wait, after nitration and reduction, the ring has an amine group at position 1. Then, the next substituent (t-Bu) would be added either ortho or para to the amine.

So, if t-Bu is added para to the amine, then when we go to add the nitro group again (step iv), that would be more challenging because the ring is now less activated (since t-Bu is an activating group, but perhaps not as strong as the amine). Alternatively, this seems a bit convoluted.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding the t-Bu group, the next step is another nitration (step iv). But wait, the target has only one nitro group. Hmm, this might not be the right path.

Looking at option D's steps, after Friedel-Crafts, another nitration is done (step iv), which would add another nitro group, but the target only has one nitro. So this might not be the correct option.

Let me look at another option.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So, benzene → t-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

So, after adding t-Bu, the ring is activated, so nitration would occur. Where would the nitro group go? The t-Bu is an ortho/para director. So, nitration would occur either at ortho or para to t-Bu. But we need the nitro to be at position 3 relative to ethoxy and t-Bu.

Wait, but after adding t-Bu, the ring is activated, so nitration would add nitro at para or ortho. Let's assume it adds at para (since t-Bu is bulky, perhaps para is more favored). So, we'd have nitro at the para position relative to t-Bu.

Then step iii: Fe/HCl → reduction of nitro to amine. So, nitro becomes amine.

Step iv: HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again. So, adding another nitro group? But the target only has one nitro. So this might not be the correct path.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are adding the ethoxy group, then the t-Bu group, then the nitro group. So, let's see which option does that.

Looking at option D, the first step is nitration, which may not be the best approach, as earlier discussed. Let's look at option C.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So, benzene → t-butylbenzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Sulfonic acid group is a strong activating, meta-directing group. Wait, but sulfonic acid is actually deactivating because of the strong -I effect, but it's a strong activating group due to resonance.

Wait, no. Sulfonic acid groups are strong activating groups because they are strong electron-withdrawing but through resonance, they donate electrons through the -SO3H group. Wait, no, that's confusing.

Wait, sulfonic acid groups are actually deactivating because the S is more electronegative, but due to resonance, they are ortho/para directors. Because the sulfonic acid group can withdraw electrons through the S-O bonds, but the lone pairs on the oxygen can conjugate into the ring, making the ring more activated. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me check: sulfonic acid groups are strong meta directors and deactivating because the -I effect dominates. Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the sulfonic acid group is a strong deactivating group (because of the strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect), but it is a strong ortho/para director because of its resonance structure. So, when you have a sulfonic acid group on benzene, it directs incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions.

So, step ii in option C is sulfonation. After adding t-Bu, we add a sulfonic acid group. Then, the next step (iii) is HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

So, when nitrating a t-butylbenzenesulfonic acid, where would the nitro group go? The sulfonic acid is a strong meta director (because it's deactivating), but wait, no, earlier I thought it was ortho/para. Hmm, perhaps I should double-check.

Wait, correction: The sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is a strong deactivating group (due to strong -I effect) and is a meta director, not ortho/para. Because the -I effect makes the ring less reactive, so the group directs incoming electrophiles to the meta position relative to itself. Wait, but I'm getting conflicting info. Alternatively, some sources say that sulfonic acid groups are meta directors because they're deactivating. So, perhaps the nitration would occur at the meta position relative to the sulfonic acid group.

Wait, but the target molecule doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonic acid group is used to activate the ring for certain reactions. Maybe in option C, after t-BuCl, they sulfonate, then nitrate.

But this seems complicated. Let me think of another approach.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, t-Bu, and nitro. Let's think about which substituent is best introduced first.

Ethoxy is an activating group, so it's a good candidate to be introduced early to facilitate the addition of other groups. Alternatively, perhaps we can introduce the ethoxy via a substitution reaction, but that's difficult without a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps using a directing group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation, which would add an ethyl group. Then, perhaps a subsequent reaction to convert that ethyl group into an ethoxy group. But that seems a bit involved.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an ether synthesis. For example, benzene could be converted into a phenol, then the phenol could be converted into an ether via a substitution. But that's a multi-step process.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a strong activating group already present to make the ring susceptible to substitution.

So, let's say we first nitrate benzene, then introduce ethoxy, then t-Bu.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director, so when adding ethoxy, it would go meta to nitro. Then adding t-Bu would be directed by both nitro and ethoxy.

Wait, but the target has ethoxy, t-Bu, and nitro all in adjacent positions, which would make their directing effects somewhat conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to first add ethoxy, then t-Bu, then nitro. Let's see.

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts alkylation with ethyl chloride → ethylbenzene.

2. Then, perhaps another Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl → but wait, benzene rings are only allowed to have up to two substituents via Friedel-Crafts, but in reality, multiple substituents are possible, especially if they're activating.

Wait, but perhaps after adding ethoxy, which is an activating group, the next substitution is easier.

Wait, but ethoxy is an activating group, so when adding the next substituent, it would go ortho or para to it.

Wait, step 1: Add ethoxy group. Using AlCl3 with an ethyl halide. So benzene → ethoxybenzene (phenetole).

Step 2: Nitration. Since ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director, the nitro group would add ortho or para to it.

But in the target, the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (t-Bu) and position 1 (ethoxy). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps after adding ethoxy, I add the t-Bu group next. Then, the nitro group would be added in the third position.

So, let me outline this:

Step 1: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with ethyl chloride → ethoxybenzene.

Step 2: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl → add t-Bu. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires a Lewis acid and an alkyl chloride. But the ring must be activated. Ethoxy is activating, so it's okay.

Now, where would the t-Bu group add? It would add ortho, meta, or para to the ethoxy group. Since ethoxy is ortho/para directing, the t-Bu would go either ortho or para. But in the target, t-Bu is adjacent to ethoxy, so perhaps it's the ortho position.

So, ethoxy at position 1, t-Bu at position 2.

Then, step 3: Nitration. Now, the ring has two substituents: ethoxy (ortho/para director, activating) and t-Bu (also ortho/para director, activating). So, when adding nitro, which is a deactivating, meta director, where would it go?

The nitro group would be directed by the substituents. The t-Bu is at position 2, and ethoxy at 1. So, the available positions are 3,4,5,6. But considering the directing effects.

Wait, in such a di-substituted benzene with ethoxy and t-Bu, the nitro group would need to be added in a position that's favored by both substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added meta to one substituent and ortho to another. Let's see.

If the ethoxy is at position 1 and t-Bu at position 2, then the meta position to ethoxy would be position 4, but that's opposite to t-Bu. Alternatively, the meta position to t-Bu would be position 5. Hmm, but the target has nitro at position 3. So, position 3 is adjacent to both ethoxy (position 1) and t-Bu (position 2). Wait, that can't happen because position 3 is adjacent to position 2 (t-Bu) and position 4. So, perhaps the nitro is added at position 3, which is ortho to t-Bu (position 2) and meta to ethoxy (position 1).

Wait, but ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director. So, the nitro would prefer to go ortho or para to the ethoxy. But when the ring already has t-Bu at position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy, the nitro could go para to ethoxy (position 4) or ortho to t-Bu (position 3) or maybe another position.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added at position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu (position 2) and away from ethoxy (position 1). But ethoxy is activating and directs ortho and para, so position 3 is meta to ethoxy. So, adding nitro at position 3 would be meta to ethoxy, which is against the ethoxy's directing effect. So that might be difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps this approach isn't working, and I should consider another order.

Wait, maybe I should first add the t-Bu group, then the ethoxy, and then the nitro. Let's see.

Step 1: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl → t-butylbenzene.

Step 2: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with ethyl chloride → ethoxy group. But where would ethoxy add? Since t-Bu is ortho/para directing, the ethoxy would add either ortho or para to t-Bu. Let's say para, at position 4.

Now, the ring has t-Bu at position 2 and ethoxy at position 4. Now, step 3: nitration. Where would nitro add? The existing groups are t-Bu (ortho/para) and ethoxy (ortho/para). So, the nitro could go in a position that's ortho to t-Bu (positions 1 or 3) or ortho to ethoxy (positions 3 or 5). But in the target, nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu (position 2) and ethoxy (position 1, but in this scenario, ethoxy is at 4).

Hmm, this isn't matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the order. Let me look again at the options and see which one makes sense.

Looking at option D's steps:

1. Nitration → nitro group added.

2. Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

3. Friedel-Crafts with t-BuCl → adds t-Bu.

4. Nitration again → another nitro group? But target has only one.

So, perhaps option D is not the correct path.

Option B:

1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl → t-Bu added.

2. Nitration → nitro added.

3. Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

4. Nitration again → another nitro? Not matching target.

Hmm.

Option C:

1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl → t-Bu added.

2. Sulfonation → adds SO3H group.

3. Nitration → nitro added.

4. Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

5. NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

6. HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration? Not sure.

This seems complicated, and I'm not seeing how the target structure arises.

Option A:

1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl → t-Bu added.

2. Nitration → nitro added.

3. SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

4. NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

5. Dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

6. H3O+/H2O/heat → perhaps hydrolysis.

7. NaOH/EtBr → perhaps SN2 substitution.

8. Fe/HCl → reduction.

9. HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

This also seems to add multiple nitro groups, which the target doesn't have.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility of using an existing substituent to direct the next substitution.

Another approach: The target has ethoxy, t-Bu, and nitro. Let's say we add ethoxy first, then nitro, then t-Bu.

Adding ethoxy first (step 1, Friedel-Crafts with ethyl chloride). Then, nitration would add nitro at ortho or para to ethoxy.

If nitro is added para to ethoxy, then the ring has ethoxy at position 1 and nitro at position 4. Then, adding t-Bu would be directed by both ethoxy and nitro. But ethoxy is activating (ortho/para) and nitro is deactivating (meta).

So, when adding t-Bu, it would be directed by the activating substituents. The ethoxy is at 1, nitro at 4.

Possible positions for t-Bu: ortho to ethoxy (positions 2 or 6) or meta to nitro (positions 2 or 6, since nitro is at 4).

So, t-Bu could add at position 2 or 6, which are ortho to ethoxy and meta to nitro.

But in the target, t-Bu is at position 2, adjacent to ethoxy (position 1) and nitro (position 3). Wait, but in this scenario, nitro is at position 4. So, that doesn't align.

Alternatively, perhaps adding nitro after ethoxy would place it at ortho, making the t-Bu addition at position 3, which is adjacent to nitro (position 2) and ethoxy (position 1). Hmm, maybe that could work.

So, let's outline:

1. Friedel-Crafts with ethyl chloride → ethoxy at position 1.

2. Nitration → nitro at ortho (position 2) to ethoxy.

Now, the ring has ethoxy at 1 and nitro at 2.

3. Now, adding t-Bu. The substituents are ethoxy (activating, ortho/para) and nitro (deactivating, meta). So, when adding t-Bu, the activating ethoxy would dominate, directing to ortho or para to ethoxy.

Ethoxy is at 1, so para would be position 4, but the target has t-Bu at position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy.

So, in step 3, t-Bu would add at position 2, ortho to ethoxy. But wait, position 2 is already occupied by the nitro group. So that's impossible.

Ah, so this approach doesn't work because the nitro is at position 2, which is where we want the t-Bu. So this is a problem.

Therefore, perhaps the order needs to be different. Maybe adding the t-Bu first, then nitro, then ethoxy.

Wait, but ethoxy is an ether, which isn't easily introduced via Friedel-Crafts. Another thought: perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution reaction after introducing a good leaving group.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after the ring has been sufficiently activated. But that requires a strongly activating group, such as a nitro group in a position that allows for meta substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a directing group. For example, introducing a nitro group, then converting it to a leaving group, and then substituting with ethoxy.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about which option correctly places all three substituents.

Looking at option D again, the steps are:

i) Nitration → nitro added.

ii) Fe/HCl → nitro → amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts with t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

iv) Nitration → another nitro.

But the target has only one nitro. So this might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the steps in option D:

i) Nitration: benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl: nitro → amine. So, nitrobenzene → phenylamine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts with t-BuCl: adds t-Bu. Now, phenylamine is a strong activating group, so t-Bu would add ortho or para to it. Let's say para. So t-Bu is at position 4.

Now, the ring has amine at 1 and t-Bu at 4.

iv) Nitration: another nitro group added. But target has only one nitro. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps step iv is another nitration, but that doesn't make sense for the target.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing the ethoxy group. Where would that come in?

Looking further, step vii is NaOH and EtBr. That suggests an SN2 substitution, perhaps to introduce an ethoxy group.

Wait, perhaps the steps in option D are:

i) Nitration → nitro.

ii) Reduction → amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → t-Bu.

iv) Nitration → another nitro? Not matching.

v) Diazotization → forms diazonium chloride.

vi) Sulfonation → perhaps adding a SO3 group, but I'm not sure.

vii) Dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

viii) H3O+/H2O/heat → acid workup.

ix) NaOH and EtBr → substitution to introduce ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via an SN2 substitution, replacing a bromide. But in this case, where would the bromide come from?

Wait, perhaps step iii adds t-Bu, then step iv adds another nitro, but I'm getting lost.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy (OEt), t-Bu, and nitro. Let's consider the positions:

- OEt at position 1.

- t-Bu at position 2.

- nitro at position 3.

So, the substituents are in a 1,2,3 arrangement, meaning each is adjacent to the next.

Now, to get the nitro at position 3, perhaps it's best to have a directing group that directs the nitro to that position.

If I first add ethoxy and t-Bu, then the nitro can be added in a position directed by both.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add ethoxy via another Friedel-Crafts.

3. Nitrate to add nitro.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the options again.

Looking back, option D's steps:

i) Nitration → nitro added.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → t-Bu added.

iv) Nitration → another nitro.

v) Diazotization → forms diazonium.

vi) Sulfonation → adds SO3.

Wait, but the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so this can't be correct.

Option C:

i) Friedel-Crafts → t-Bu added.

ii) Sulfonation → adds SO3.

iii) Nitration → nitro.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

v) Diazotization → forms diazonium.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

Hmm, this leads to multiple nitro groups, which isn't desired.

Option B:

i) Friedel-Crafts → t-Bu added.

ii) Nitration → nitro added.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

iv) Nitration → another nitro.

Again, multiple nitro groups, which can't be right.

Option A:

i) Friedel-Crafts → t-Bu added.

ii) Nitration → nitro.

iii) Sulfonation → adds SO3.

iv) Diazotization → amine to diazonium.

v) Dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis (maybe introducing a hydroxyl group).

vi) H3O+/H2O/heat → more hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH and EtBr → introduces ethoxy via SN2.

viii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

ix) Nitration → another nitro.

This seems to involve a lot of steps, including introducing a sulfonic acid group, which the target doesn't have.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's think again about the substituents and their directing effects in the target.

The target has ethoxy (OEt) at position 1, t-Bu at 2, and nitro at 3.

So, for the nitro at position 3, what directs it there?

If the existing substituents are OEt at 1 and t-Bu at 2, then when adding nitro, the ring has two activating groups. OEt is ortho/para, t-Bu is ortho/para. So, the nitro would tend to add where these two groups direct.

But nitro is a deactivating group; adding it would be difficult unless the ring is sufficiently activated.

Wait, but if the ring is activated by two groups, perhaps the nitration can proceed.

In this case, the OEt and t-Bu are both activating, so the ring is strongly activated, allowing nitration to occur.

Where would the nitro group add? It would be directed by the most activating group.

OEt is activating, but t-Bu is also activating. The positions available adjacent to both OEt and t-Bu would be position 3.

So, OEt is at 1, t-Bu at 2. Nitro would be at position 3, which is adjacent to both.

But wait, can that happen? Because OEt is at 1 and t-Bu at 2, the position 3 is adjacent to t-Bu and across from OEt. So, the nitro would be meta to OEt and ortho to t-Bu.

Since OEt is a strong activating group, it would direct nitration to ortho or para. Para to OEt is position 4. Ortho to OEt is positions 2 and 6. Position 2 is occupied by t-Bu, so nitro would go to position 6 (ortho to OEt) or position 4 (para to OEt).

But the target has nitro at position 3, so this approach doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps an alternative is to have the nitro group added after adding one substituent, then another substituent is added, and this directs the nitro to the correct position.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is: add ethoxy, then nitro, then t-Bu.

Wait, let me try:

1. Friedel-Crafts with ethyl chloride → OEt at position 1.

2. Nitration → nitro adds at ortho (position 2) or para (position 4) to OEt.

If nitro is at position 2, then the next substituent (t-Bu) would be added where? The ring now has OEt (1) and nitro (2).

t-Bu is added via Friedel-Crafts. OEt is activating (ortho/para), nitro is deactivating (meta).

So, the t-Bu would be directed by the activating OEt group, likely at position 3 (meta to nitro) or position 6 (ortho to OEt). But in the target, t-Bu is at position 2, which is already occupied by nitro. So that doesn't work.

Alternatively, if nitro is added at position 4 (para to OEt), then t-Bu would be added at position 2 or 6. Position 2 is adjacent to OEt (position 1) and across from nitro (position 4). So, perhaps t-Bu is added at position 2. Then, the ring has OEt (1), t-Bu (2), and nitro (4). But the target has nitro at 3, so this doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the correct order is adding the nitro first, then the ethoxy and t-Bu. But as I thought earlier, nitro is deactivating, making subsequent substitutions difficult.

Wait, but perhaps after adding nitro, we can activate the ring again in certain positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution reaction after nitro has been added, but that's challenging without a good leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced using a directing group. For example, if nitro is at position 3, then adding ethoxy would go at position 1 (ortho to nitro's position 3), but nitro is meta director, so that's not possible.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should instead look for an option that correctly places all three substituents in the right order.

Looking again at option D:

Steps:

i) Nitration → nitro added.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts with t-BuCl → adds t-Bu.

iv) Nitration → another nitro.

Hmm, but target has only one nitro. So option D doesn't seem correct.

Option B:

i) Friedel-Crafts → t-Bu added.

ii) Nitration → nitro added.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

iv) Nitration → another nitro.

Again, multiple nitro groups.

Option C:

i) Friedel-Crafts → t-Bu added.

ii) Sulfonation → SO3 added.

iii) Nitration → nitro added.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

v) Diazotization → amine to diazo.

vi) HNO3 → nitration again.

This doesn't help.

Option A:

i) Friedel-Crafts → t-Bu added.

ii) Nitration → nitro added.

iii) Sulfonation → SO3 added.

iv) Diazotization → amine to diazo.

v) Dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis (maybe introducing OH).

vi) H3O+/H2O → more hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy via SN2.

viii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro.

ix) Nitration → another nitro.

Again, multiple nitro groups.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something about the steps. Let me consider that some steps might not add substituents but modify existing ones.

Wait, perhaps in option D, after nitration and reduction, the amine is at position 1, then adding t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts would be at position 3 (meta to amine), but then another nitration would add nitro at position 5 (meta to amine and ortho to t-Bu), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the correct option is D because it introduces the nitro group first, then the t-Bu, and then another nitro group, but that doesn't fit the target.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the correct order of substituent addition to get all three groups in the right positions.

Wait, another approach: The target has ethoxy (OEt), t-Bu, and nitro. Let's imagine that the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution reaction, perhaps using a leaving group. But benzene isn't reactive enough for that unless activated.

Perhaps the correct path is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Introduce ethoxy group via Friedel-Crafts → but wait, aniline is a strong activating group. So, adding ethoxy via Friedel-Crafts would be possible. But wait, ethoxy is an ether, so perhaps it's introduced via a different method.

Wait, perhaps using an ethyl halide with AlCl3, but that would add an ethyl group, not an ethoxy. So, maybe after forming aniline, we can perform a reaction to introduce ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For example, aniline could be converted into a diazonium salt, which under certain conditions can be substituted. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a sulfonation step followed by displacement, but I'm not sure.

Another idea: Perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the ring has been activated by a nitro group. Wait, but nitro is deactivating. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding the t-Bu and nitro, the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D because it ends with introducing the ethoxy group via NaOH and EtBr, which is an SN2 reaction. Let's see:

Option D's steps:

i) Nitration → nitro group added.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → t-Bu added.

iv) Nitration → another nitro group? No.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps. Let me outline option D's steps:

1. Nitration → benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Fe/HCl → nitro → amine. Now, the ring has an amine group.

3. Friedel-Crafts with t-BuCl → t-Bu added. The amine is a strong activating group, so t-Bu would add ortho or para to it.

Assuming t-Bu adds at position 3 (if amine is at position 1), then position 3 would have t-Bu.

4. Nitration → another nitro group. But target has only one.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: looking for the correct substituent order in the options.

The target has the ethoxy, t-Bu, and nitro in positions 1,2,3 respectively.

Looking for an option where the nitro is added after the other two groups, as the nitro is deactivating.

Looking at option D, the nitro is added first, which may not be the best approach.

Option C: Steps start with Friedel-Crafts (t-Bu), then sulfonation, then nitration. Hmm.

If after adding t-Bu and sulfonic acid, nitration would add nitro at a position directed by both. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to first add t-Bu, then ethoxy, then nitro. But I'm not sure how that would work with the directing effects.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D because it introduces the substituents in a way that allows all three to be present. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

Add ethoxy first, then t-Bu, then nitro.

Looking at the options, none of the options directly reflect this. So perhaps the correct option is not among them. But given the options, I have to choose.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct because after adding the nitro, the ethoxy is introduced via substitution. Let me think.

In option D:

Step ix is NaOH/EtBr, which is likely an SN2 reaction. So, perhaps a bromide is present on the ring, which is then displaced by an ethoxide ion.

So, perhaps the sequence is:

i) Nitration → nitro.

ii) Reduction → amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → t-Bu.

iv) Nitration → another nitro.

Hmm, but that's two nitro groups.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about each option again.

Option D's steps:

i) Nitration → nitro.

ii) Fe/HCl → amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → t-Bu.

iv) Nitration → another nitro.

v) Diazotization → amine to diazonium.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

vii) Dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

viii) H3O+/H2O → more hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy via SN2.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve introducing a leaving group (like bromide) which is then replaced by ethoxide.

But how?

Wait, perhaps after step iii, the ring has t-Bu and amine. Then step iv adds nitro, which may not fit. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added after the ethoxy and t-Bu. Looking for that in the options.

Wait, perhaps option D's step vii is dilute H2SO4, which might be a hydrolysis step. Then step viii is acid workup, leading to something. Step ix is NaOH and EtBr, which would substitute a bromide with ethoxy.

But where would the bromide come from?

Perhaps earlier steps introduce bromide via substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is option D.

But I'm not entirely confident. After thinking through all the options and possible reaction sequences, I think option D is the correct one because it introduces the substituents in a way that allows all three to be present.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy (-OEt) at position 1, tert-butyl (t-Bu) at position 2, and nitro (-NO2) at position 3. These substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene pattern, meaning they are adjacent to each other. The analysis of the options focuses on the order of substitution and the directing effects of the groups.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:
   - Starts with a Friedel-Crafts alkylation using tert-butyl chloride, adding t-Bu to the ring.
   - Followed by nitration, which would add the nitro group ortho or para to t-Bu.
   - Subsequent steps include sulfonation, diazotization, and hydrolysis, but these do not align with the target structure, as they introduce additional groups or alter the existing ones inappropriately.
   - This option does not lead to the desired product.

2. **Option B**:
   - Begins with a Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add t-Bu.
   - Proceeds with nitration, which would add the nitro group ortho or para to t-Bu.
   - Includes reduction of nitro to amine and another nitration step, which introduces an additional nitro group.
   - The target molecule has only one nitro group, so this option is incorrect.

3. **Option C**:
   - Starts with a Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add t-Bu.
   - Followed by sulfonation, which adds a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), a strong deactivating group.
   - Proceeds with nitration, but the directing effects of the sulfonic acid group complicate the placement of the nitro group.
   - Additional steps, such as reduction and diazotization, do not align with the target structure.
   - This option does not yield the desired product.

4. **Option D**:
   - Begins with nitration, adding a nitro group to benzene.
   - Followed by reduction of the nitro group to an amine using Fe/HCl.
   - Proceeds with a Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add t-Bu.
   - Another nitration step introduces a second nitro group, which is inconsistent with the target molecule.
   - However, the sequence includes steps (e.g., NaOH/EtBr) that could introduce the ethoxy group via substitution, potentially aligning with the target structure.
   - Despite the complexity and some ambiguity in the steps, this option appears to offer the most plausible pathway to the desired product.

### Conclusion:
Option D is the most likely sequence to synthesize the target molecule, as it includes steps that align with the necessary transformations and substitution patterns, even though the reasoning involves some uncertainty due to the complexity of the sequence.
