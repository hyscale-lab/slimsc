Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon. The operator is along an arbitrary direction n which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue corresponding to this eigenvector is +ħ/2. 

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to the possible states the system can be in when measured. The eigenvalues are the possible results of that measurement.

Wait, the operator is given in components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator P along an arbitrary direction n can be expressed as P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But wait, since the direction vector n lies in the x-z plane, that means the y-component (n_y) is zero. So the operator simplifies to P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Let me write down what each component looks like. P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], P_y is (ħ/2)*[[0,-i],[i,0]], and P_z is (ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]]. So substituting these into P, P becomes (ħ/2) times (n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]]).

Wait, let me compute that. So P = (ħ/2)( [n_x *0 + n_z *1, n_x *1 + n_z *0], [n_x *1 + n_z *0, n_x *0 + n_z (-1)] )? Hmm, maybe I should structure it properly.

Actually, when you have a direction vector n = (n_x, 0, n_z), because it's in x-z plane. So n_x and n_z are the components, with n_y=0. The vector n must be a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So the operator P is (ħ/2) multiplied by (n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]]). Let me compute that matrix:

First, compute the matrices inside. Let me compute n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]]

Then n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]

Adding these two matrices gives:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

So the operator P is (ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

Now, we want the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So we have to solve the equation (P - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

Let me compute (P - (ħ/2) I):

It's (ħ/2) * [[n_z - 1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1]]

Wait, because I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so (ħ/2)( [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] ) - (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,1]] becomes (ħ/2) multiplied by [[n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1]]

So the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -(n_z +1)] ]

We can factor out (ħ/2), so the equation is:

( (n_z -1) a + n_x b ) * (ħ/2) = 0
( n_x a - (n_z +1) b ) * (ħ/2) = 0

Since ħ/2 is non-zero, the equations simplify to:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0
n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0

We can write these as:

(1) (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0
(2) n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0

We need to find non-trivial solutions (a, b not both zero). So we can set up the system and find the ratio of a to b.

Let me solve equation (1) for a:

From (1): a = [ -n_x b ] / (n_z -1) 

But let me substitute into equation (2):

n_x a = (n_z +1) b

Substitute a from (1) into this equation:

n_x [ (-n_x b) / (n_z -1) ) ] = (n_z +1) b

Simplify:

- (n_x^2) b / (n_z -1) ) = (n_z +1) b

Assuming b is not zero, we can divide both sides by b:

- (n_x^2) / (n_z -1) ) = n_z +1

Multiply both sides by (n_z -1):

- n_x^2 = (n_z +1)(n_z -1) 

Which is:

- n_x^2 = (n_z)^2 - 1 

Rearranging:

n_z^2 + n_x^2 = 1 

Wait, but we already know that n is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. So this equation holds true. So our substitution is consistent. That means any solution from equation (1) is valid.

So from equation (1), a = [ -n_x b ] / (n_z -1 )

Let me express the ratio a/b as [ -n_x ] / (n_z -1 )

So the eigenvector can be written as (a, b) = [ -n_x, (n_z -1) ] multiplied by a normalization factor.

Wait, let me think. Let me choose b as a parameter, say b = k. Then a = [ -n_x k ] / (n_z -1 )

So the eigenvector is proportional to ( -n_x, (n_z -1) )

Wait, but perhaps I should find a more general expression. Alternatively, perhaps I should parameterize the direction n.

Since n is in the x-z plane, it can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So substituting n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ into the ratio a/b.

a/b = [ - sinθ ] / ( cosθ -1 )

Wait, let me compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the eigenvector in terms of θ.

So let's substitute n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ.

Then equation (1) becomes:

a = [ - sinθ * b ] / ( cosθ - 1 )

But cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). Let me see if I can simplify this.

Let me compute the denominator: cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(theta/2)

The numerator: - sinθ = - 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So a = [ -2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) * b ] / [ -2 sin²(theta/2) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The negatives cancel. 2 cancels with 2.

So a = [ sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) * b ] / [ sin²(theta/2) ]

Which is (cos(theta/2) * b ) / sin(theta/2 )

So a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] * b 

Which is a = cot(theta/2) * b 

So the eigenvector components are a = cot(theta/2) b, and b = b. Let's choose b to be sin(theta/2 ), then a becomes cos(theta/2).

Wait, perhaps I should represent the eigenvector as [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] multiplied by some factor. Let's check.

Wait, if a = cos(theta/2) and b = sin(theta/2), then a/b = cot(theta/2), which matches our earlier ratio.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but let's think about normalization. The eigenvector should be normalized, so the sum of squares of the components should be 1.

So [ cos(theta/2) ]^2 + [ sin(theta/2) ]^2 = 1. So the vector is already normalized.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. With a = cos(theta/2) and b = sin(theta/2), the vector is (a, b) = (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which has a length of 1. So that's correct.

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches. But wait, let me look at the options again.

Option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is exactly what I've found. But wait, what about option B and D?

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which might be related to spherical coordinates, but I'm not sure where the phi comes from here since in the problem statement, the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi would be 0 or pi, perhaps. So maybe that's not the case here.

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem says the direction n lies in the x-z plane. So the original operator is along (n_x, 0, n_z), right? So in spherical coordinates, phi is zero because it's in the x-z plane. So perhaps the phi term is not needed here. So the eigenvector would be (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

But wait, wait again. Let me think about the matrix P. When the direction is along the z-axis, n is (0,0,1), so theta = 0. Then the operator P would be (ħ/2) P_z. The eigenstate for +ħ/2 is (1, 0), which would correspond to cos(theta/2) = cos(0) = 1, and sin(theta/2) = 0. That matches. Similarly, when the direction is along x (n=(1,0,0)), theta = pi/2. So cos(theta/2) = cos(pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(theta/2)=sqrt(2)/2. So the eigenvector would be (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2). Let me check the options.

Looking at option A: (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ). That would be if the vector is scaled by ħ, but the eigenvectors are dimensionless, right? Because operators are in units of ħ. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors are usually normalized, and the components are just complex numbers, not multiplied by ħ. So I think the options that have ħ multiplied are incorrect, unless I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, but looking back, the problem says "the elements of the normalized eigenvector." So the eigenvectors are normalized, so their magnitude is 1.

Wait, but looking at option C, it doesn't have any ħ terms, which makes sense because eigenvectors are dimensionless. So option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, another approach: perhaps the operator is along n, which in the x-z plane, so n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Then the eigenvector is proportional to (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But let me look at the options again.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) )

Wait, why would the eigenvector components have sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors? That would imply some specific direction, but the problem is asking for a general eigenvector for an arbitrary theta. So option C is more likely correct as it's general.

Wait, but maybe I missed something about the operator. Let me think again.

Wait, the operator is P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z, which is a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 should satisfy P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the eigenvector for the general case. Let me try setting theta as the angle in the x-z plane, so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So the operator P is (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Then, the eigenvalue equation is:

( (cosθ) a + sinθ b ) * (ħ/2) = (ħ/2) a 

Similarly,

( sinθ a - cosθ b ) * (ħ/2) = (ħ/2) b 

Wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so the equations become:

( (cosθ) a + sinθ b ) (ħ/2) = (ħ/2) a → (cosθ a + sinθ b ) = a → (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0

And 

(sinθ a - cosθ b ) (ħ/2) = (ħ/2) b → sinθ a - cosθ b = b → sinθ a = (cosθ +1) b → a = [ (cosθ +1)/ sinθ ] b 

So substituting a into the first equation: (cosθ -1) [ (cosθ +1)/ sinθ ] b + sinθ b = 0 

Let me compute this: [ (cosθ -1)(cosθ +1) / sinθ + sinθ ] b = 0 

The numerator (cosθ-1)(cosθ+1) = cos²θ -1 = -sin²θ 

So we have [ (-sin²θ) / sinθ + sinθ ] = [ -sinθ + sinθ ] = 0. So it holds true, so any a and b that satisfy a = [ (cosθ +1) / sinθ ] b would work.

Let me choose b = sinθ/(2), then a = [ (cosθ +1)/ sinθ ] * sinθ/(2) = (cosθ +1)/2 

Wait, but simplifying this, (cosθ +1) = 2 cos²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So a = [2 cos²(theta/2)] / (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) * b, but wait I'm getting a bit tangled here. Alternatively, perhaps I can express a and b in terms of theta/2.

Let me write a = (cosθ +1)/(sinθ) * b

But cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2) -1 → cosθ +1 = 2 cos²(theta/2)

And sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So a = [2 cos²(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] ) * b = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] * b = cot(theta/2) * b 

So choosing b = sin(theta/2), then a = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2 ) = cos(theta/2)

So the eigenvector is (a, b) = (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is exactly option C.

But looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). That fits perfectly. So the correct answer seems to be option C.

The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed as $\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$ are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, $n_y = 0$, and $\vec{n}$ can be parameterized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis.

The operator $\vec{P}$ simplifies to:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & -\cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is $\vec{P} |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle$, where $|v\rangle = (a, b)$. Substituting $\vec{P}$ into the eigenvalue equation, the system of equations becomes:

\[
\begin{cases}
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0, \\
\sin\theta a - (\cos\theta + 1)b = 0.
\end{cases}
\]

From the first equation, $a = \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta - 1} b$. Substituting this into the second equation confirms the consistency of the solution. To simplify, we parameterize $a$ and $b$ in terms of $\theta/2$:

\[
\cos\theta = 2\cos^2(\theta/2) - 1, \quad \sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2).
\]

This leads to $a = \cos(\theta/2)$ and $b = \sin(\theta/2)$. The resulting eigenvector is:

\[
|v\rangle = \left(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2)\right).
\]

This eigenvector is already normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$: This is incorrect because it introduces unnecessary scaling factors and does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$: This is incorrect because it introduces a $\phi$ term, which is irrelevant since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane ($\phi = 0$).
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$: This matches the derived eigenvector and is correct.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$: This is incorrect because it introduces unnecessary scaling factors.

Thus, the correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.
