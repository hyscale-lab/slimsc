Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Okay, let's read it carefully.

The question is about an uncharged spherical conductor. It has a small cavity inside, and the cavity's center is offset from the conductor's center by a distance s. The cavity's radius is r, and it's smaller than R, the conductor's radius. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. I need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.

Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Both l and L are greater than R, so P is outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are four different expressions for E. Hmm.

I remember from my studies that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is uncharged, it initially has no net charge. But when a charge is placed inside the cavity, things change.

Wait, when a charge is inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor itself is neutral. Oh, right, I think that in such a scenario, the induced charges on the conductor's inner and outer surfaces would come into play.

Let me think: For a conducting shell, any charge inside the cavity will induce an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface, and the outer surface will have no net charge because the conductor itself is neutral. Or wait, no, the conductor is neutral, so the outer surface must have the same charge as the inner surface, but wait, no. Let me correct that.

Wait, the conductor is neutral. So the total charge is zero. When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge -q on the inner surface of the conductor. Then, since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance the -q on the inner surface. Wait no, because the total charge of the conductor is zero. So the inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must have +q, making the total charge (inner: -q, outer: +q) sum to zero. Because the conductor's initial charge is zero, so yes.

But wait, when a conductor is neutral and you place a charge inside its cavity, the inner surface gets an induced opposite charge, and the outer surface must have a charge equal in magnitude to that induced charge to keep the conductor neutral. Because the conductor's net charge is zero, so inner is -q, outer is +q. So the net charge is zero.

But wait, in this problem, the conductor is uncharged and initially neutral. So when you put a +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have -q, and the outer surface will have +q. So the outer surface's charge is +q, which is the same as the charge inside the cavity.

But wait, the conductor's own material must have charges that rearrange. So the conductor's total charge is zero, so the charges on the inner and outer surfaces must balance. That is, inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must have +q, making the total charge zero.

Now, the electric field outside the conductor would be as if the charge were located at the center of the conductor. Because the outer surface's charge distribution is symmetric when the conductor is a sphere. But wait, in this case, the cavity is not at the center. The cavity's center is offset by s. So the situation is a bit more complicated.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface is a sphere, right? So regardless of where the charge is inside the cavity, the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform, because the conductor is a sphere. So the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q, and the point P is outside the conductor.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So when you're outside the conductor, the electric field is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. So the E field at point P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to P.

But wait, let me think again. The induced charges on the conductor are such that the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface +q. So the conductor's outer surface acts as a point charge of +q when viewed from outside.

So the electric field outside the conductor is due to the +q charge, located at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options, that's option B: E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Wait, but why is the position of the cavity irrelevant? Because the conductor's outer surface's charge distribution is uniform, so the field outside depends solely on the total charge and distance from the conductor's center.

Yes, because the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface's charges would distribute uniformly regardless of where the cavity's charge is located. So the field outside is as if the charge is at the center.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option B.

But wait, let me think again. What about the point P's distance from the cavity's center being l, and the angle theta? Doesn't that affect the field?

Hmm, the problem says that l is the distance from P to the cavity's center, and L is the distance from P to the conductor's center. So point P is outside the conductor, which has radius R, and L is larger than R. The position of the cavity's center is at a distance s from the conductor's center, and the point P is at a distance L, making the position of the cavity's center relative to P a bit more complex.

Wait, but the field outside a conductor depends only on the total charge on the conductor's outer surface and the distance from the conductor's center, regardless of where the inner charge is located. Because the conductor's outer surface is a sphere, and the charge is uniformly distributed. So the field outside is as if the charge is at the center.

So, even if the cavity's center is offset, the outer surface's charge distribution still looks like a point charge at the conductor's center.

So, the correct formula is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So the correct option is B.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small cavity inside. The cavity's center is offset from the conductor's center by a distance $s$, and a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The goal is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the conductor's center and a distance $l$ from the cavity's center. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

Key points to consider:

1. **Conductor Properties**: The conductor is initially uncharged, so its total charge is zero. When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. To maintain charge neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge $+q$.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: The electric field outside a conductor depends only on the total charge on the conductor's outer surface and the distance from the conductor's center. Since the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere, the charge $+q$ on the outer surface distributes uniformly, and the field outside the conductor behaves as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

3. **Irrelevance of Cavity's Position**: The position of the cavity (and hence the induced charges) does not affect the electric field outside the conductor. The field outside depends solely on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the conductor's center to the point $P$.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The formula involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option B**: Correct. The electric field outside the conductor is given by $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{L^2}$, which matches the expected result based on the total charge $+q$ on the outer surface and the distance $L$.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The formula involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The formula involves $l^2$, which does not account for the distance $L$ from the conductor's center, the correct factor for the electric field outside the conductor.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
