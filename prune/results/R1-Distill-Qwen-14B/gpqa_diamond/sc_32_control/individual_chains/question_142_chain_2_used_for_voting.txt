Okay, so I have this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including both pure states and mixed states. Oh wait, a density matrix for a pure state would have a trace of 1 and be idempotent (ρ² = ρ), but this one is a mixed state because it's a sum of projectors divided by two. Because |0><0| and |1><1| are projectors, each with trace 1. So when you add them, the trace is 2, and then multiplied by 1/2 gives trace 1. So this is a valid density matrix.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position. I think this relates to how density matrices are represented in terms of Bloch vectors or vectors in the space. I remember that for a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch sphere. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector. The vector r gives the direction and magnitude of the point on the Bloch sphere.

So let's write down the given ρ. It's (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute each term. |0><0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ = (I)/2. Because I is [[1,0],[0,1]], ρ is [[0.5,0],[0,0.5]].

But wait, the general form is (I + r·σ)/2. Let me write that out. The Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So r·σ is r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

Now, the general ρ is [[ (1 + r_z)/2 , (r_x - i r_y)/2 ], [ (r_x + i r_y)/2 , (1 - r_z)/2 ] ]

But in our case, ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. Comparing this to the general form, the (1,2) and (2,1) elements are zero. That implies that the off-diagonal terms (r_x - i r_y)/2 and their conjugates must be zero.

So (r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0. Which means r_x = 0 and r_y = 0. Because the real part is r_x and the imaginary part is -r_y. So for the real part to be zero, r_x=0, and for the imaginary part to be zero, r_y=0.

Looking at the diagonal terms: (1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

So r_z is zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That would mean it's the completely mixed state, which makes sense because ρ is a completely mixed state, equal probability of being in 0 or 1, and no coherence.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). Option B is (0,0,1), which would be the state |0> if I'm not mistaken. Because when r is (0,0,1), then ρ is (I + σ_z)/2, which is |0><0|.

So in this case, our ρ is (I)/2, which is a maximally mixed state. Therefore, the Bloch vector is at the origin.

Wait, but why isn't it at (0,0,0)? Because the density matrix is the maximally mixed state. Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit, as it has equal probability of being in the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) and no coherence. The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r}\) is the Bloch vector that determines the position of the state on the Bloch sphere.

For the given \(\rho\), expanding \(\rho\) shows that the off-diagonal terms are zero, which implies \(r_x = 0\) and \(r_y = 0\). Additionally, the diagonal terms are equal, which implies \(r_z = 0\). Therefore, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the maximally mixed state.

Among the options provided:
- **Option A** (\(r = (1,1,0)\)) and **Option D** (\(r = (1,1,1)\)) are incorrect because they describe states with non-zero Bloch vector components, which would correspond to pure or partially mixed states.
- **Option B** (\(r = (0,0,1)\)) is incorrect because it describes the pure state \(|0\rangle\), not the maximally mixed state.
- **Option C** (\(r = (0,0,0)\)) is correct because it corresponds to the maximally mixed state.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.
