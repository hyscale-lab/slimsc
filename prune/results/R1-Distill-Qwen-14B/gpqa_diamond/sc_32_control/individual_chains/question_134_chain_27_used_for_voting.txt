Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that we're mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. And we need to find the enthalpy change for this neutralization reaction.

Wait, but wait. Neutralization usually involves an acid reacting with a base. So the HCl and H2SO4 are acids, and Ba(OH)2 is a base. So when they mix, they'll neutralize each other. But I need to figure out how much acid and base there is, and see which one is in excess, if any. Because the neutralization depends on the stoichiometry.

First, let me find out the moles of each acid and base.

HCl is a strong acid, and it's monoprotic, right? So each molecule gives one H+ ion. So the moles of HCl: Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 500 mL which is 0.5 liters. So moles = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. That's 0.1 moles H+ from HCl.

H2SO4 is sulfuric acid, which is a strong acid as well. But wait, it's diprotic. The first dissociation is complete, so each H2SO4 gives two H+ ions. Wait, no, actually the first H+ is fully dissociated, and the second one is also strong, but in solution, H2SO4 typically donates both protons completely. So for H2SO4, each mole gives 2 moles of H+. So the moles of H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L (since 300 mL is 0.3 L) = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but wait. Sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid, so each mole gives 2 H+. So total H+ from both acids is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles of H+.

Now the base is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each formula unit releases two OH- ions. So for each mole of Ba(OH)2, we get two moles of OH-. The moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

So total H+ available is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. Let's see which is in excess. The reaction between H+ and OH- is 1:1, so 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH- would mean that OH- is the limiting reagent. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and the H+ left would be 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles.

Wait, no. Wait, the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So moles of H+ and OH- will neutralize each other in a 1:1 ratio. So the H+ available is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- can react with 0.2 moles of H+, leaving 0.08 moles of H+ unreacted. That means the H+ is in excess, but wait, no, the OH- is the limiting reagent.

Wait, but wait, what about the neutralization in terms of equivalents? Because for each mole of H2SO4, you have two H+; each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH-.

But let me think in terms of equivalents. Equivalents are moles multiplied by the number of H+ or OH- ions per molecule.

So for acids: HCl contributes 0.1 eq (because each mole gives 1 H+). H2SO4 contributes 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 eq. So total acid equivalents: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 eq.

Base: Ba(OH)2 has 0.1 moles, each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 eq.

So the neutralization is between acid and base equivalents. So the reaction will proceed until the OH- runs out. So 0.2 eq OH- will react with 0.2 eq H+. The remaining H+ is 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 eq.

But wait, the neutralization is between the H+ and OH-. So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So the neutralization will produce 0.2 moles of water, leaving 0.08 moles of H+ unreacted. That means the solution will be acidic because there's excess H+.

But the question is about the enthalpy of neutralization. Enthalpy of neutralization is typically the heat released when an acid and base react to form water. It's usually given per mole of H+ neutralized. But sometimes it's expressed per mole of acid or base, depending on the reaction.

Wait, but the enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat change when one mole of H+ and one mole of OH- combine to form water. So each mole of H+ and OH- produces about 57.3 kJ of heat (since ΔH for forming water from H+ and OH- is about -57.3 kJ per mole of H2O).

But wait, the options are in kcal and kJ. Let me check: 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So 57.3 kJ is about 13.66 kcal.

But wait, the problem is asking for the enthalpy of neutralization when these are mixed. So how much H+ and OH- actually react?

In this case, the OH- is 0.2 moles, so the neutralization is 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacting, producing 0.2 moles of H2O. So the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ. But wait, the question is about the enthalpy of neutralization, which is per mole of H+ or OH- neutralized. So the total heat released would be 0.2 * (-57.3) kJ = -11.46 kJ.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm. Wait, wait. If the neutralization releases heat, the enthalpy change is negative. So the value would be negative.

Wait, but the options have options in kcal and kJ. Let me see: option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher than 11.46. So that's not matching.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, the problem is mixing three solutions, HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. So all three are being mixed together. So the H+ comes from both acids, and the OH- from the base.

Wait, but when you mix them, the H+ will come from both HCl and H2SO4. So the total H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. So the reaction that occurs is the 0.2 moles of OH- reacting with 0.2 moles of H+ to form 0.2 moles of H2O. The rest of the H+ (0.08 moles) will remain in solution, making it acidic. So the neutralization is only for 0.2 moles.

So the enthalpy change would be for 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacting.

Each mole of H+ and OH- reaction gives ΔH = -57.3 kJ. So 0.2 moles would give 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ. Converting to kcal: 11.46 kJ divided by 4.184 ≈ 2.738 kcal. Wait, but that makes the enthalpy -2.738 kcal. Which is close to option A) -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but wait. No, wait. Because the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H2O formed. So 0.2 moles of H2O would produce 0.2 * (-57.3) kJ = -11.46 kJ. But sometimes, the enthalpy of neutralization is given per mole of acid or base. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. Oh wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat when one mole of H+ is neutralized. So each mole of H+ gives off 57.3 kJ. So 0.2 moles would give 0.2 *57.3 = 11.46 kJ. But if the question is about the total enthalpy change for this reaction, it would be negative 11.46 kJ, which is about -11.46 kJ. But the options have D as -16.0 kJ, which is higher. So that doesn't match. Alternatively, if the calculation is done in kcal, 11.46 kJ is about 2.74 kcal, so -2.74, which is option A.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-, determine the limiting reactant, then compute the enthalpy based on the moles that react.

So here's the plan:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from each acid.
2. Calculate moles of OH- from the base.
3. Determine the limiting reactant (which will be OH- in this case, 0.2 moles).
4. The reaction will produce 0.2 moles of H2O, releasing 0.2 * 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ. Since this is exothermic, the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.46 kJ, so about -11.5 kJ. But looking at the options, the choices are:

A) -2.72 kcal
B) -11.42 kcal
C) -3.80 kcal
D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, option B is -11.42 kcal. Let me see: 11.46 kJ is approximately 2.74 kcal. So 0.2 moles would be about 2.74 kcal, so the enthalpy change would be -2.74 kcal, which is close to option A (-2.72 kcal).

But wait, wait another thing. The enthalpy of neutralization is typically measured per mole of acid or base. So for a strong acid and strong base, the enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.3 kcal/mol (per mole of H2O formed), but wait, no, wait: no, 57.3 kJ per mole of H2O. So per mole of H+ neutralized, it's 57.3 kJ.

Wait, wait. Let me get the exact value. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57.3 kJ per mole of H2O produced, which involves one mole of H+ and one mole of OH- combining. So for each mole of H+ neutralized, it's -57.3 kJ.

In this case, 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized, so 0.2 * 57.3 = 11.46 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.46 kJ. But looking at the options, D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger. Hmmm. So that's not matching.

Wait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake in the units. Let me check the options again. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Let me compute 11.46 kJ in kcal. Since 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ, 11.46 kJ /4.184 ≈ 2.738 kcal. So the change is -2.738 kcal. Which is very close to option A (-2.72 kcal). So the answer would be A.

But wait, wait another thing. The question says "the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4 and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed."

Wait, but wait. Another thought: the neutralization between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2. Because Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 can neutralize two moles of H+ (since it provides two OH- per mole). Hmm, wait, no. Let me think about the reaction. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-.

The neutralization between H2SO4 (which is diprotic) and Ba(OH)2 (which provides two OH- per mole) would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Wait, that's the reaction. So one mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce one mole of BaSO4 and two moles of H2O. So in terms of H+ and OH-:

H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH-.

So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. Since H2SO4 provides two H+ and Ba(OH)2 provides two OH- per mole, the stoichiometry is 1:1 for the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

So in this case, the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would neutralize each other in a 1:1 ratio. But we have 0.09 moles of H2SO4 and 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2. So the H2SO4 is the limiting reagent here, because 0.09 < 0.1. So all 0.09 moles of H2SO4 would react with 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, producing 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H2O.

Wait, but then what about the remaining Ba(OH)2? 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 moles of Ba(OH)2 left. Each Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-, so 0.01 * 2 = 0.02 moles OH-.

But wait, the HCl also contributes H+. HCl is 0.1 moles, so 0.1 moles H+.

So let's recompute the total H+ and OH-.

First, the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2: 0.09 moles H2SO4 reacts with 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2.

H2SO4 gives 2 H+ per mole → 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- per mole → 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles OH-.

These 0.18 moles OH- neutralize 0.18 moles H+ from H2SO4, producing 0.18 moles H2O.

After that, the remaining H+ is from HCl: 0.1 moles. The remaining OH- is from the leftover Ba(OH)2: 0.01 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.02 moles OH-.

So now, the H+ comes from HCl (0.1 moles) and any unreacted H+ from H2SO4? Wait, no, because the H2SO4 was completely neutralized in the first reaction. So the total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl). The OH- is 0.02 moles.

So the H+ and OH- will react in a 1:1 ratio. 0.02 moles OH- will react with 0.02 moles H+ from HCl, producing 0.02 moles H2O.

So total H2O produced is 0.18 (from H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2) + 0.02 (from HCl and leftover Ba(OH)2) = 0.20 moles.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate all H+ and all OH- first, considering all the sources, then find the net reaction.

Let me try that approach.

Total H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles → 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles → 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles OH-.

So H+ = 0.28 moles, OH- = 0.2 moles.

The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So they will react in a 1:1 ratio, producing 0.2 moles H2O, leaving 0.08 moles H+ unreacted.

So the total enthalpy change is for 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacting. Each mole releases 57.3 kJ, so 0.2 * 57.3 = 11.46 kJ. Since the reaction is exothermic, the enthalpy change is negative: -11.46 kJ.

But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger than 11.46. Hmm, but none of the options have -11.46 kJ. However, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, 11.46 kJ is approximately 2.74 kcal (since 11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.74). So that would be approximately -2.74 kcal, which is very close to option A (-2.72 kcal).

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem is about the enthalpy of neutralization. The standard value is per mole of H2O formed. So the total moles of H2O formed is 0.2. So the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the neutralization of all possible H+ and OH- regardless of source. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the mistake I made was in the initial calculation of the H+ and OH-. Let me recalculate:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each H2SO4 gives 2 H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles OH-.

So H+ = 0.28, OH- = 0.2.

They react 1:1, so 0.2 moles H+ and OH- neutralize, leaving 0.08 H+.

So the amount of H2O formed is 0.2 moles.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, none of them have -11.46 kJ, but option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but 11.46 kJ is about 2.74 kcal, not 11.42. Ah, wait a second! I think I might have made a unit conversion mistake. Let me check:

Wait, 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ. So 11.46 kJ is equal to 11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.738 kcal. So the enthalpy change would be -2.738 kcal, which is approximately -2.74 kcal. So that would correspond to option A, which is -2.72 kcal.

But wait, why is option B -11.42 kcal? That's much larger than what I'm calculating. So I'm getting confused. Maybe I should check my approach again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization of all possible H+ and OH- from all sources, but given that the H+ is in excess, the neutralization stops when OH- is exhausted. So the total heat released is based on 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacting. So the heat is -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.46 kJ or -2.74 kcal.

So if option A is -2.72 kcal, that's close. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to sum all H+ and OH- and multiply by the enthalpy per mole, but I'm certain that the OH- is the limiting reagent.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization of each acid with the base, not considering that some H+ comes from both acids.

HCl is 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4 is 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 moles → 0.2 moles OH-.

So H+ total is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 moles of H+ will react, leaving 0.08 H+.

So enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ. So that's approximately -11.46 kJ, which is about -2.74 kcal.

So the correct answer should be option B, but wait, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 47.7 kJ. That doesn't align.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up between kJ and kcal here. Let me clarify:

57.3 kJ is 57.3 kJ per mole of H2O.

So for 0.2 moles: 0.2 * 57.3 = 11.46 kJ. So that's 11.46 kJ, which is about 2.74 kcal (since 11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.738).

So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ or -2.74 kcal.

Looking at the options:

Option A) -2.72 kcal → close to -2.74 kcal.

Option D) -16.0 kJ → which is larger than 11.46.

So the correct answer would be A.

But wait, the options don't have an option with -11.46 kJ. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier in considering the neutralization.

Wait another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization in terms of equivalents, but in a different way.

Wait, considering that H2SO4 is diprotic, each mole contributes 2 equivalents of H+. Ba(OH)2 contributes 2 equivalents of OH- per mole.

So the equivalents of acid: HCl (0.1) + H2SO4 (0.18) → 0.28 equivalents.

Equivalents of base: Ba(OH)2 (0.2).

So the neutralization is 0.2 equivalents, leaving 0.08 equivalents of acid.

So the heat released is 0.2 * 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ → -11.46 kJ. So again, that's about -2.74 kcal.

So the correct answer would be option A (-2.72 kcal), but why is option B present?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to use the molarities and volumes without considering the stoichiometry correctly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering each acid and base separately, but I think that's unlikely.

Wait, another angle: when mixing these three solutions, perhaps the strong bases and acids fully dissociate, and the neutralization occurs as I calculated. So the correct enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -2.74 kcal, so option A.

But wait, the options also have option D: -16.0 kJ, which is larger. Let me see what 16 kJ would be in terms of H2O moles. 16 /57.3 ≈ 0.279 moles. Which is about 0.28, the total H+ available. So perhaps if all H+ were neutralized, the enthalpy would be 0.28 *57.3 ≈ 16.04 kJ, which would be option D. But that can't happen because OH- is only 0.2 moles.

So perhaps the problem expects us to consider the maximum possible neutralization, but that's not correct because OH- is the limiting factor.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but based on the calculations, the correct enthalpy change should be -11.46 kJ, which is about -2.74 kcal. So the closest option is A (-2.72 kcal). But wait, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is around 47.7 kJ, which is much higher than our calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me double-check.

Wait, 11.46 kJ is indeed 2.74 kcal. So the correct answer should be option A.

Alternatively, if the question is asking for the total enthalpy change regardless of the neutralization limit, but that doesn't make sense. So I think the answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are considered:

1. **Determine moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - **HCl:**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since HCl is monoprotic, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).
   - **H₂SO₄:**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since H₂SO₄ is diprotic, it contributes \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).
   - **Total H⁺ from acids:**  
     \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Determine moles of OH⁻ from the base:**
   - **Ba(OH)₂:**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since Ba(OH)₂ releases 2 OH⁻ ions per formula unit, it contributes \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

3. **Determine the limiting reactant:**
   - The reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻ is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \), which proceeds in a 1:1 molar ratio.  
   - Total H⁺ available = \( 0.28 \, \text{moles} \), and total OH⁻ available = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - OH⁻ is the limiting reactant, as it will be completely consumed, leaving \( 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 \, \text{moles of H⁺ unreacted} \).

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The enthalpy of neutralization for one mole of H⁺ and OH⁻ forming H₂O is approximately \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ} \).  
   - Since \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ react}, the total enthalpy change is:  
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57.3 \, \text{kJ}) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]
   - Converting to kcal (using \( 1 \, \text{kcal} = 4.184 \, \text{kJ} \)):  
     \[
     -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \div 4.184 \approx -2.74 \, \text{kcal}.
     \]

5. **Compare with the options:**
   - Option A: \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) is very close to the calculated value of \( -2.74 \, \text{kcal} \).  
   - Option B: \( -11.42 \, \text{kcal} \) corresponds to approximately \( 47.7 \, \text{kJ} \), which is much larger than the calculated value.  
   - Option C: \( -3.80 \, \text{kcal} \) is far from the calculated value.  
   - Option D: \( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \) is also larger than the calculated value of \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, as it is the closest to the calculated enthalpy change.

Answer: A
