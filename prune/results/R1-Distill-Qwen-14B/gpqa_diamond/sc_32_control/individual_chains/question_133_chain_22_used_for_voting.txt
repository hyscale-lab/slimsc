Okay, so I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from chemistry. The solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both of these are phosphate salts, so they should dissociate in water to give phosphate ions in different forms.

Wait, orthophosphate is HPO4^3- or maybe PO4^3-? Oh, no, I think orthophosphate is actually H3PO4, but when it dissociates, it goes through several steps. The different K values (Ka1, Ka2, Ka3) must be important here.

So, first, I should figure out the amount of each salt in moles. The solution volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters.

The first salt is KH2PO4. Its molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. So moles of KH2PO4 would be 1.00 g divided by 136.09 g/mol. Let me calculate that: 1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.00735 moles.

The second salt is Na2HPO4·2H2O, which has a molar mass of 177.99 g/mol. So moles would be 1.00 g / 177.99 ≈ 0.00562 moles.

Now, when these salts dissolve in water, what do they contribute? Let me think. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So each mole gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: when it dissociates, it should give Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. Wait, but wait, the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O. So Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate. So the formula would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water. So each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. But orthophosphate is the HPO4^3- form, right? Or wait, orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4. In solution, it dissociates:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

So the species in solution are H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4·2H2O). But the question is about orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to HPO4^2- or PO4^3-?

Wait, orthophosphate is HPO4^3-? Or is it PO4^3-? No, wait, orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, which is a triprotic acid. So the different forms are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-.

Orthophosphate usually refers to the HPO4^2- ion, I think. Wait, wait, no. Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think. Orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, which would be PO4^3-.

But in this solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. So I need to determine which form is considered orthophosphate in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that in the solution, the phosphate can take various forms, and orthophosphate refers to the HPO4^2- ion.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4. When it loses one proton, it becomes H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), losing another becomes HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and then PO4^3- (phosphate). So HPO4^2- is hydrogen phosphate, PO4^3- is phosphate.

Wait, but in this solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. So how does that affect the concentration of orthophosphate?

Wait, perhaps the problem considers HPO4^2- as the orthophosphate ion. So we need to find the concentration of HPO4^2- in solution. But wait, the solution contains both H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4).

But wait, in solution, these two ions can interconvert. Because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can gain a proton to become H2PO4^-.

So the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will depend on the pH of the solution.

But how do I find the pH? Because the solution is a buffer solution, made from a weak acid (H3PO4) and its conjugate base. Wait, but in this case, the two salts are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So the solution is a buffer system between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Oh, right! So this is a buffer solution consisting of H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4). So the pH can be determined using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-. The relevant Ka is Ka2, which is 6.2x10^-8.

Wait, because Ka1 is for H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^-.

Ka2 is for H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-.

Ka3 is for HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-.

So when dealing with the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- system, we use Ka2.

So first, let's calculate the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Moles of H2PO4^- = 0.00735 mol.

Each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

Moles of HPO4^2- = 0.00562 mol.

The total volume is 0.2 L, so concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.00735 / 0.2 = 0.03675 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.00562 / 0.2 = 0.0281 M.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 is the negative log of Ka2. Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21?

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

Ka2 = 6.2e-8 → log(6.2e-8) = log(6.2) + log(1e-8) → approximately 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076.

Wait, no. Wait, pKa = -log(Ka). So for Ka2 =6.2e-8, pKa2 = 7.207.

So pH = 7.207 + log(0.0281 / 0.03675)

Compute the ratio: 0.0281 / 0.03675 ≈ 0.765.

Log(0.765) is about -0.115.

So pH ≈ 7.207 - 0.115 ≈ 7.092.

Now, the solution's pH is around 7.09.

But what do we need? The concentration of orthophosphate ions. As I'm a bit confused about which ion is considered orthophosphate, I need to clarify.

Wait, orthophosphate refers to PO4^3-, but in this solution, the predominant species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. However, under certain conditions, some of the HPO4^2- can deprotonate to form PO4^3-, but given the pH, it's probably minimal.

But wait, the question is about orthophosphate ions. I think in this context, the orthophosphate ion refers to HPO4^2-, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps "orthophosphate" is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-. Let's think about the phosphate species in solution.

At pH 7.09, which is just below the pKa2 (~7.21), the HPO4^2- is the dominant species because pH is close to pKa2. So the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But wait, the pH is slightly lower than pKa2. So the H2PO4^- is the acid, and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base. So in a buffer, the major species are these two. The concentration of PO4^3- would be very low because the pH is lower than pKa3.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem may just want the total concentration of phosphate ions, meaning HPO4^2- and PO4^3-? Or perhaps just HPO4^2-?

Wait, the problem says "orthophosphate ions". I think orthophosphate is HPO4^2-.

So in this solution, the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.0281 M, but wait no, because the solution is in equilibrium, so some HPO4^2- will react with H2PO4^- based on the pH.

Wait, no. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation already accounts for the ratio of the two. The concentrations are adjusted based on the pH. So the actual [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-] are as calculated before, because the buffer equation gives the ratio, but in reality, the amounts are fixed by the initial moles. So perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used when you have a weak acid and its conjugate base. The concentrations in the equation are the actual concentrations, not the initial moles. So the [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-] are considered as their equilibrium concentrations.

Wait, but in the solution, the initial amounts are fixed. So the initial moles of H2PO4^- is 0.00735, and HPO4^2- is 0.00562. But upon dissolution, some H2PO4^- will deprotonate to form HPO4^2- and some HPO4^2- will protonate to form H2PO4^-.

So the actual concentrations will be such that the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] equals 10^(pH - pKa2).

Which is 10^(7.092 -7.207) = 10^(-0.115) ≈ 0.77.

Which is about 0.77, which is close to the initial ratio of 0.0281 / 0.03675 ≈ 0.765.

So the initial ratio is very close to the ratio given by the pH, which suggests that the concentrations don't change much. So the initial concentrations are a good approximation.

Wait, but wait, in the solution, the actual concentrations would be:

Let me denote:

Let me consider that the solution is a buffer with H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base), so the Henderson equation applies. The ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-] is 10^(pH - pKa2). Which we calculated as 0.77.

So from the initial concentrations, [H2PO4^-] is 0.03675 M, [HPO4^2-] is 0.0281 M.

So [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.0281 / 0.03675 ≈ 0.765, which is very close to 0.77. So the solution is already in equilibrium. So the concentrations don't change much, meaning [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.0281 M.

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. So if orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, then the concentration is about 0.0281 M.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. The solution is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 L. The moles of HPO4^2- are 0.00562. So initial concentration is 0.00562 / 0.2 = 0.0281 M.

But in reality, some of the H2PO4^- will deprotonate to form HPO4^2-, and some of the HPO4^2- will protonate to form H2PO4^-.

But the Henderson equation tells us that [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2) ≈ 10^(-0.115) ≈ 0.768.

So let me denote:

Let the concentration of HPO4^2- be x, and H2PO4^- be y.

We have x / y = 0.768.

And the total concentration of these two species is (x + y) = (0.00735 + 0.00562)/0.2 = 0.01295 / 0.2 = 0.06475 M.

Wait, no. Wait, the total initial moles of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are 0.00735 +0.00562 = 0.01297 mol. So in 0.2 L, total concentration is 0.01297 / 0.2 = 0.06485 M.

But since some of each is converted into the other, x + y = 0.06485 M.

And x/y = 0.768 → x = 0.768 y.

Substituting into the first equation:

0.768 y + y = 0.06485 → 1.768 y = 0.06485 → y = 0.06485 / 1.768 ≈ 0.0366 M.

Then x = 0.768 * 0.0366 ≈ 0.0281 M.

Which is exactly the same as the initial concentrations. So no change occurs because the initial ratio is already close to the equilibrium ratio. Therefore, the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are approximately 0.0281 and 0.0366 M respectively.

So if orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, its concentration is about 0.0281 M.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, and the options are on the order of 1e-7 M. But 0.0281 M is 2.81e-2 M, which is way larger than any of the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Ah! I think I confused the phosphate ions. Orthophosphate is actually PO4^3-. Because HPO4^2- is hydrogen phosphate, and PO4^3- is phosphate (orthophosphate). So in this solution, the orthophosphate (PO4^3-) concentration is very low because the pH is around 7.09, which is below pKa3.

Wait, pKa3 is 1.8e-12, so pKa3 is about 11.74.

At pH 7.09, which is much lower than pKa3, the predominant form is HPO4^2-.

Wait, so the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low. Let me calculate [PO4^3-].

Using the third dissociation step:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-; Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

So, the concentration of PO4^3- can be found using the expression:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] ) / [H+]

We have Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.0281 M.

[H+] can be found from the pH. pH is 7.09, so [H+] = 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

So plug the numbers in:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.0281) / 8.21e-8.

Calculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.0281 ≈ 5.058e-14.

Divide by 8.21e-8: 5.058e-14 / 8.21e-8 ≈ 6.16e-7 M.

So [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.16e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close to this value.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

Ka3: 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.0281 M.

[H+] = 10^-7.09. Let me compute that accurately.

10^-7.09: since 7.09 is 7 + 0.09. 10^0.09 ≈ 1.23 (since log(1.23)=0.0899). So 10^(-7.09) = 1/(10^7 * 1.23) ≈ 1/(1.23e7) ≈ 8.13e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.0281) / 8.13e-8.

Calculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.0281 = 5.058e-14.

Divide by 8.13e-8: 5.058e-14 / 8.13e-8 = (5.058 / 8.13) * 1e-6.

5.058 /8.13 ≈ 0.622. So 0.622e-6 = 6.22e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.22e-7 M. So the closest option is A) 6.24e-7 M.

So the orthophosphate ion concentration is approximately 6.2e-7 M, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts, KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, in water. The solution contains H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄) and HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O). These ions form a buffer system, and the pH of the solution can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}\right)
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each salt
- Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \(\frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00735 \, \text{mol}\)
- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \(\frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00562 \, \text{mol}\)

### Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations
- Volume of solution = \(200.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.2 \, \text{L}\)
- \([\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{0.00735 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.03675 \, \text{M}\)
- \([\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{0.00562 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.0281 \, \text{M}\)

### Step 3: Use Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH
The relevant \(K_a\) for the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ system is \(K_a_2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}\), so:
\[
\text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207
\]
Substitute into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 + \log\left(\frac{0.0281}{0.03675}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 + \log(0.765) \approx 7.207 - 0.115 = 7.092
\]

### Step 4: Calculate [PO₄³⁻]
Orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) are formed from the deprotonation of HPO₄²⁻:
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightarrow \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}
\]
The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \(K_a_3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}\). Using the expression for \(K_a_3\):
\[
K_a_3 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]
Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a_3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]
From the pH, \([\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.092} \approx 8.21 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\). Substituting:
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.0281)}{8.21 \times 10^{-8}}
\]
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.058 \times 10^{-14}}{8.21 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.16 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Match with options
The calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (\(6.16 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)) is closest to option **A) \(6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)**.

Answer: A
