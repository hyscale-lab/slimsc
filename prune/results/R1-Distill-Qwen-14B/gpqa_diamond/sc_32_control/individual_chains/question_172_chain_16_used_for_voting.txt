Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that photosphere is the layer of a star where light is emitted. And the question is about the excitation of iron atoms in two stars, star_1 and star_2. 

The key point is that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, does that mean that the excitation energy is higher in star_1? Or does it refer to the number of atoms in that excited state? I think it's about the population of atoms in that energy level. So, the excitation here probably refers to the fraction of atoms in a higher energy state compared to a lower one.

In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of particles among energy levels is described by the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the population of two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy), E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me call that delta E. So, E2 - E1 = delta E.

The problem states that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Wait, I need to clarify what exactly is being compared. Are they comparing the ratio of atoms in the excited state to the ground state for each star? Or perhaps the ratio of the excitation for star_1 to star_2 is 2:1. The question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to star_2." Oh, maybe the excitation parameter is the same as the ratio of the populations.

Wait, maybe the number of atoms in the excited state divided by the number in the ground state is twice for star_1 compared to star_2. So, (n2/n1)_star1 = 2 * (n2/n1)_star2.

But using Boltzmann, the ratio (n2/n1) is (g2/g1) exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Let's assume the statistical weights are the same for both stars, since the same element (iron) and same energy levels are considered. So g2/g1 is a constant for both stars. Let's call it 'u' for simplicity.

So, for star_1, (n2/n1)_1 = u * exp( -deltaE/(k T1) )

For star_2, (n2/n1)_2 = u * exp( -deltaE/(k T2) )

The problem states that (n2/n1)_1 = 2 * (n2/n1)_2.

So substituting:

u * exp( -deltaE/(k T1) ) = 2 * [ u * exp( -deltaE/(k T2) ) ]

We can divide both sides by u, so:

exp( -deltaE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -deltaE/(k T2) )

Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides to make it easier.

ln( exp( -deltaE/(k T1) ) ) = ln( 2 exp( -deltaE/(k T2) ) )

Simplify left side: -deltaE/(k T1) = ln(2) + ln( exp( -deltaE/(k T2) ) )

The right side simplifies to ln(2) - deltaE/(k T2)

So:

- deltaE/(k T1) = ln(2) - deltaE/(k T2 )

Let me rearrange terms:

deltaE/(k T2) - deltaE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor deltaE/(k) [ (1/(T2)) - (1/(T1)) ) ] = ln(2)

Hmm, let's factor the equation:

deltaE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Multiply both sides by k:

deltaE (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2) *k

But wait, wait, let's write it as:

(deltaE/k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Let me factor out the negative sign:

(deltaE/k) [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Hmm, perhaps I can rearrange the terms:

Let me write [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] as [ (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ]

Because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So substituting back:

(deltaE/k) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, no, wait:

1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So substituting:

(deltaE/k) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So,

(deltaE)/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

I can write this as:

ln(2) = (deltaE/(k)) (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Wait, but deltaE is given as 1.38e-23 J. And k is Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, wait, that's the same value as the deltaE given.

So deltaE = k * (some number). Let me compute deltaE/(k):

deltaE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So deltaE/(k) is 1 K.

So substituting back:

ln(2) = (1 K) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Hmm, looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Yes, that's what I derived. So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where the excitation of iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 is twice that of star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). Assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the Boltzmann distribution applies, and the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_2/g_1 \) is the statistical weight ratio, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For simplicity, assume \( g_2/g_1 \) is the same for both stars.

For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratios are:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} \big|_{\text{star}_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} \big|_{\text{star}_2} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2, so:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} \big|_{\text{star}_1} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_2}{n_1} \big|_{\text{star}_2}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:

\[
\frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Dividing through by \( \frac{g_2}{g_1} \):

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring \( \Delta E/k \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1T_2} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), we find \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \). Thus:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1T_2}.
\]

This matches option D.
