Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read through it carefully again.

The question is about a star with some specific characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two different energy levels. Hmm. Let's see.

So, the star's normal radius is 1.5 solar radii, but when it has spots, some part of its surface is covered. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature drops from 6000 K to 5500 K. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, the question says when the surface is not covered, the Teff is 6000 K. But when 40% is covered by spots, the overall Teff decreases to 5500 K. So that means the spots are making the star cooler overall.

Then, in the photosphere, when looking at the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (levels 1 and 2), the ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Wait, the ratio is N1/N2, right? They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when there's no spots, the ratio is higher than when there are spots. So we're looking for a factor greater than 1.

The ratio is based on the energy levels transition corresponding to 1448 Å. So this is probably related to the Saha equation or Boltzmann equation because it's about the population of energy levels in a thermal equilibrium (LTE is assumed).

Let me think. The Saha equation deals with ionization, but here it's about neutral atoms, so maybe it's more about the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of populations of two energy levels as (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(kT)), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

So the ratio N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(kT) )

Or wait, let me get the exact form. The Boltzmann factor is often written as N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So if the ratio N1/N2 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So the ratio depends exponentially on 1/T. Because higher temperature would lead to higher ratio?

Wait, but wait: if the temperature decreases, what happens to the ratio? Let me consider the exponential part.

If T decreases, then (E2 - E1)/(k T) becomes larger (since denominator is smaller). So the exponential term increases. So N1/N2 increases as T decreases? Because if T is smaller, then 1/T is larger, so the exponential term is bigger. So for lower T, the ratio N1/N2 is higher.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K) compared to 6000 K when no spots. And when there are spots, the observed ratio N1/N2 decreases. Hmm, that's contradictory based on my previous thought.

Wait, wait. Let's think again. When the star has spots, Teff is 5500 K. But the spots are cooler regions, right? So the overall photosphere is a mix of the normal parts and the spotted parts. But wait, the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the star's average temperature is now lower, resulting in lower T.

But the observed ratio N1/N2 is lower when the star has spots (so when T is lower). So according to our earlier analysis, if T decreases, the ratio N1/N2 increases. But in the problem, when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio N1/N2 is lower. That's conflicting.

Hmm, maybe I got the ratio inverted. Let me double-check.

Suppose level 1 is lower in energy than level 2. Then E2 > E1. So (E2 - E1) is positive.

Then the ratio N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

If T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so the exponential increases. So N1/N2 increases as T decreases. So if star has spots, T is lower, so N1/N2 should be higher. But in the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. That's a contradiction.

Wait, maybe I have the ratio inverted. Perhaps the observed ratio is N2/N1, not N1/N2.

Wait, the question says: the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two levels (level 1 and level 2). The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, N1/N2 is lower than when there's no spots. So when T is 5500 K, N1/N2 is lower than at 6000 K.

Wait, that would mean that as T increases, N1/N2 decreases. So let's see, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

If T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponential decreases. So N1/N2 decreases as T increases. That matches the observation. Because when T is higher (no spots, 6000 K), N1/N2 is lower than when T is lower (spots, 5500 K). Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the problem when spots are present, the Teff is lower, so T is lower, meaning N1/N2 should be higher. But the problem says the observed ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to model this.

Let me compute the ratio when T is T1 (6000 K) and when T is T2 (5500 K).

Suppose when T increases, the ratio N1/N2 decreases, so when T is higher, ratio is lower.

So, when the star has no spots, T is higher (6000K), so N1/N2 is lower. When spots, T is lower (5500 K), so N1/N2 is higher. But the problem says when there are spots, the ratio decreases. So that suggests that the ratio when no spots is higher than when spots are present. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, the problem says: "the ratio decreases when the star has spots." So when there are spots (T=5500 K), the ratio is lower than when no spots (T=6000 K). So N1/N2 (T=5500) < N1/N2 (6000 K). But according to the formula, if T increases, N1/N2 decreases. So, that would imply that N1/N2 is higher when T is lower. So when T is 5500 K, N1/N2 is higher than when T is 6000 K. But the problem says when the star has spots (5500 K), the ratio is lower. So I'm getting conflicting information.

Hmm, maybe I have the ratio wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the energy is E1 and E2 with E1 < E2, but the ratio is N2/N1 instead of N1/N2.

Let me think. Let me correct my formula.

The correct Boltzmann equation is:

N2 / N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k T) )

So, if E2 > E1, the exponent is negative, so N2/N1 is less than 1.

So, when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so N2/N1 increases.

So, if the ratio being discussed is N2/N1, and the problem says it decreases when the star has spots. So when T decreases (spots present), N2/N1 decreases. Let me see.

Wait, when T decreases, the exponent -(E2-E1)/(k T) becomes more negative, so N2/N1 is smaller.

So, if without spots, T is 6000 K, N2/N1 is higher than when T is 5500 K.

So, when the star has spots, N2/N1 is lower. So, the ratio (N2/N1) is lower in spots, which matches the problem statement if the ratio we're looking at is N2/N1.

But wait, the problem says the ratio of N1/N2, which is the inverse. So if the ratio observed is N1/N2, and when the star has spots, this ratio decreases, that implies that N1/N2 is lower in spots than when no spots. But according to the formula, N1/N2 is 1/(N2/N1). So if N2/N1 is higher when T is higher, then N1/N2 is lower when T is higher.

Wait, let's compute the ratio.

Let me model this.

When T is higher (6000 K), N2/N1 is higher (since T is higher, exponent is less negative). So N1/N2 is lower.

So when no spots (T1 =6000 K), N1/N2 is lower than when spots are present (T2=5500 K), because N1/N2 = 1/(N2/N1). If N2/N1 is higher, then N1/N2 is lower.

Wait, but the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. So when the star has spots (T2=5500 K), N1/N2 is lower than when T=6000 K. But according to the formula, when T increases, N1/N2 decreases. So when no spots (T1=6000 K), N1/N2 is lower than when T is 5500 K. But the problem says when spots are present, the ratio decreases. So perhaps I'm getting the ratio backwards.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the ionization, but no, the problem is about neutral atoms. So it's about their energy levels.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the ratio N1/N2 for both cases and find the factor.

The ratio when no spots (T=6000 K) is R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) )

When spots (T=5500 K), R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) )

The factor is R1 / R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

We need to compute this factor.

But wait, I don't know the value of E2-E1. But the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. Hmm, I can find the energy difference from the wavelength.

The energy of a photon is E = hc / λ.

h is Planck's constant, c speed of light.

E2 - E1 = hc / λ.

So let's compute that. But we need to compute it in terms of kT, maybe, because the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k T). Or wait, let's compute the ratio.

Wait, the factor is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Let me compute (E2-E1)/(k) in terms of T1 and T2.

But I can write (E2-E1) = hc/λ.

So:

Factor = exp( (hc/(λ k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

But hc/(k) is a known value.

Let me compute hc/(k):

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

So hc = (6.626e-34)(3e8) = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by k: 1.9878e-25 / 1.38e-23 ≈ 0.0144 J/(K·m) ?

Wait, wait, no, let me recompute:

h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Then hc/k = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.38e-23 J/K) )

= (1.9878e-25) / (1.38e-23) m·K

= approximately (1.9878 / 1380) m·K ≈ 0.00144 m·K.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me compute the numbers:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.38e-23 J/K:

(1.9878e-25)/(1.38e-23) = (1.9878 / 138) * 1e-2 = approximately (0.0144) * 0.01 = 0.00144. Hmm, yes, 0.00144 m·K.

But m·K is meters times Kelvin? That seems odd, but perhaps it's okay.

Wait, but let's compute the wavelength 1448 Å. 1 Å is 1e-10 meters. So 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So λ = 1.448e-7 m.

So (E2-E1)/(k) = hc/(λ k) = (hc/k) * (1/λ) )

We've computed hc/k as approximately 0.00144 m·K.

So (1/λ) is 1/(1.448e-7 m) ≈ 6.9209e6 m^-1.

Multiply by hc/k: 0.00144 m·K * 6.9209e6 m^-1 = 0.00144 * 6.9209e6 K ≈ 10,000 K.

Wait, let me compute it exactly.

hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

λ = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So (E2-E1)/(k) = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K) )

Wait, wait, perhaps better to compute E in terms of k·T.

E = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) )

E = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) J.

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.373e-18 J.

But 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so E ≈ 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV.

But let's compute E/(k) because the exponent in the Boltzmann factor is E/(k T).

k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So E/k = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) ≈ 9.95e4 K.

So E/(k) ≈ 99,500 K.

So the factor is exp( (E/(k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Plug in T1=6000 K, T2=5500 K.

Compute 1/T1 - 1/T2 = (1/6000) - (1/5500) = (5500 - 6000)/(6000*5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = -5e2 / 3.3e7 ≈ -0.00001515.

Wait, let me compute it more precisely.

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818

So 0.000166667 - 0.000181818 = -0.000015151.

So (E/(k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) = 99500 K * (-0.000015151) ≈ 99500 * (-1.5151e-5) )

Compute 99500 * 1.5151e-5:

99500 = 9.95e4.

9.95e4 * 1.5151e-5 = (9.95 * 1.5151) * 1e-1 ≈ (15.060) * 0.1 = 1.506.

But since the term is negative, it's -1.506.

So the factor is exp( -1.506 ) ≈ ?

Exp(-1.506) ≈ e^-1.5 is about 0.223. e^-1.506 is a bit less. Let's compute.

e^1.506 ≈ 4.5 (since ln(4)=1.386, ln(5)=1.609, so 1.506 is between 4 and 5. Let me compute 4.5: ln(4.5)=1.504, which is very close. So e^1.506 ≈ 4.51. So e^-1.506 ≈ 1/4.51 ≈ 0.2217.

So the factor R1/R2 = exp( -1.506 ) ≈ 0.2217.

Wait, but wait. I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let's go back.

Wait, when the star has no spots, T1=6000 K, and with spots, T2=5500 K. The factor is R1/R2 = exp[ (E/(k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ]

Which is exp( (99500 K) * ( (1/6000) - (1/5500) ) )

Compute the term (1/6000 - 1/5500):

= (5500 - 6000)/(6000 *5500 )

= (-500)/(33,000,000 )

= -5e2 / 3.3e7 = -5/(33000) = approximately -1.515e-5.

So (99500) * (-1.515e-5) = 99500 * -0.00001515 = let's compute:

99500 * 0.000015 = 1.4925. So 99500 * 0.00001515 is approximately 1.506.

So with the negative, it's about -1.506.

Exponentiating gives e^-1.506 ≈ 0.2217.

So the ratio R1/R2 is approximately 0.2217.

Wait, but R1 is the ratio when no spots (T=6000 K), and R2 is when spots (T=5500 K).

Wait, but according to the problem statement, when the star has spots, the ratio R (N1/N2) decreases. So R2 < R1.

But according to our calculation, R1/R2 is about 0.2217, meaning R1 is 0.2217 * R2. So R1 is smaller than R2. But the problem says that when the star has spots, R decreases (so R2 < R1). So our calculation shows that R1 is smaller, which would contradict the problem statement unless I have the ratio inverted.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in which ratio is which. Let me double-check.

The ratio R is N1/N2. So when T increases, R decreases because N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

If E2-E1 is positive, then as T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponential term is smaller, so R is smaller.

So when T is 6000 K (no spots), R1 is smaller than when T is 5500 K (spots) because at lower T, the exponential is larger, making R larger.

So R1 < R2, which would mean that when the star has spots, R increases, but the problem says it decreases. Therefore, I must have the ratio reversed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the ratio N2/N1. Let me re-examine the question.

The question says: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)". So it's N1/N2.

But the problem states that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T decreases (spots), N1/N2 decreases.

Wait, according to the formula, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

If T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so N1/N2 increases. But the problem says the ratio decreases when T is lower (spots). So this suggests that maybe I have the energy levels inverted, E1 > E2.

Wait, maybe level 1 is higher in energy than level 2. So E1 > E2, so E2 - E1 = negative.

In that case, (E2 - E1)/(k T) is negative.

So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E1-E2)/(k T) )

If E1-E2 is positive, then (E2-E1)/(k T) is negative.

So when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the exponential becomes smaller, so N1/N2 decreases.

That matches the problem statement.

So in this scenario, the transition corresponds to a photon being emitted when an atom drops from level 1 to level 2. So the wavelength corresponds to E1 - E2.

So I think this makes sense. So with E1 > E2, when T is lower, the ratio N1/N2 decreases.

So let me recalculate.

E1 - E2 = hc/λ = 1.9878e-25 J·m / (1.448e-7 m) ) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

E1 - E2 = 1.373e-18 J.

E1-E2 = 1.373e-18 J.

So (E1 - E2)/(k) = 1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 ≈ 99500 K.

Thus, (E1 - E2)/(k T) is 99500 / T.

So the ratio N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) )

= (g1/g2) * exp( - (99500)/T )

So when T decreases (from 6000 to 5500), the exponent becomes more negative, the exp becomes smaller. So N1/N2 decreases.

Which matches the problem statement.

So now, the factor is R1/R2 = [ (g1/g2) exp( -99500 / T1 ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -99500 / T2 ) ]

= exp( -99500 (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Because:

exp( -99500/T1 ) / exp( -99500/T2 ) = exp( -99500 (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

So (1/T1 -1/T2) is (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500 - 6000)/(6000*5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = -1.515e-5.

So -99500*( -1.515e-5 ) = 99500 * 1.515e-5 ≈ Let's compute.

99500 * 1.515e-5 = 99500 * 0.00001515 = Let's compute 99500 * 0.000015 = 1.4925.

And 99500 * 0.00000015 = approx 14.925 * 0.00015 = about 0.00223875.

Wait, maybe a better approach: 1.515e-5 = 1.515 * 1e-5.

So 99500 * 1.515e-5 = (99500) * 1.515 * 1e-5.

99500 * 1e-5 is 9.95. So 9.95 * 1.515 ≈ 15.05.

So the exponent is 15.05.

So the factor R1/R2 = exp(15.05) ≈ ?

Wait, exp(15) is about 3.269 million. Exp(15.05) is a bit more. Let me compute.

But wait, wait a second. The exponent is positive, so exp(15.05) is a very large number. But in the problem statement, the factor is one of the options, which are all less than 10. So this can't be right.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, when I compute (1/T1 - 1/T2), it's 1/6000 - 1/5500.

Which is (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000 )= -1.515e-5.

Then, -99500 * ( -1.515e-5 ) = 99500 * 1.515e-5.

Compute 99500 * 1.515e-5:

99500 = 9.95e4.

9.95e4 * 1.515e-5 = 9.95 * 1.515 * 1e-1.

9.95 * 1.515 ≈ let's compute:

9 * 1.515 = 13.635.

0.95 *1.515≈ 1.44.

So total ≈13.635 +1.44 =15.075.

Multiply by 1e-1: 1.5075.

So the exponent is 1.5075.

So the factor R1/R2 = exp(1.5075) ≈ e^1.5075.

e^1 is 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817.

e^1.5075 is slightly higher.

Compute e^0.5075:

We know e^0.5 ≈ 1.6487, e^0.5075 ≈ 1.66.

So e^1.5075 = e^1 * e^0.5075 ≈ 2.718 * 1.66 ≈ 4.5.

So approximately 4.5.

So the factor is about 4.5.

But wait, R1 is when there are no spots (T=6000 K), R2 is when spots are present (T=5500 K).

The factor R1/R2 is exp(1.5075) ≈ 4.5.

Which option is ~4.5?

Looking at the options:

Option C) ~4.5.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately 4.5.

So the answer should be C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, \( N_1/N_2 \), under the influence of temperature changes caused by the presence of dark spots on the star's surface. The photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann equation governs the population ratio:

\[
\frac{N_1}{N_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \( E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

### Key Observations:
1. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \), so the energy difference \( E_2 - E_1 \) can be calculated using \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant and \( c \) is the speed of light.
2. When the star has no spots, \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \).
3. The problem states that the ratio \( N_1/N_2 \) decreases when the star has spots, implying \( N_1/N_2 \) is higher at \( T_1 \) than at \( T_2 \).

### Calculation:
1. Compute \( E_2 - E_1 \):
   \[
   E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Convert to units of \( kT \):
   \[
   \frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99,500 \, \text{K}.
   \]

2. The ratio \( N_1/N_2 \) depends on \( \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right) \). The factor by which the ratio changes is:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)\right).
   \]

3. Compute \( \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} = \frac{5500 - 6000}{6000 \times 5500} = \frac{-500}{33,000,000} \approx -1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]

4. Substitute into the factor:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp\left(99,500 \times (-1.515 \times 10^{-5})\right) = \exp(-1.5075).
   \]

5. Compute \( \exp(-1.5075) \):
   \[
   \exp(-1.5075) \approx 0.2217.
   \]

6. Since the problem asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we take the reciprocal:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \frac{1}{0.2217} \approx 4.5.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio \( N_1/N_2 \) changes by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots.
