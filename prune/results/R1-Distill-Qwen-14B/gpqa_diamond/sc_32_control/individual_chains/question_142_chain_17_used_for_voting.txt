Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, let me remember what I've learned.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I think I need to figure out where this state is located geometrically. I remember that density matrices represent quantum states, possibly mixed states, and their geometric positions are points in a space, maybe the Bloch sphere or something similar.

Wait, I've heard about the Bloch sphere being used to represent qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. So perhaps this density matrix corresponds to a point in that space. But how do I find the coordinates?

I recall that for a qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector components. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (r_x, r_y, r_z). So, I should express the given ρ in this form to find r.

Let me write out the given ρ first. It's (|0><0| + |1><1|) multiplied by 1/2. Wait, |0><0| is a projector, same for |1><1|. So when I add them, I get |0><0| + |1><1|. Let me compute that matrix.

In terms of the basis |0> and |1>, |0><0| is a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 in (2,2). So adding these gives a diagonal matrix with [1,0; 0,1], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (1/2) * I. Oh, because I is the identity matrix.

Wait, the identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So ρ is (1/2) * I, which is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. Hmm.

Now, the general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. Let's write that out. The Pauli matrices σ = [σ_x, σ_y, σ_z], and each is a 2x2 matrix. So r·σ is r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

So (I + r·σ)/2 would be [[(1 + r_z)/2, (r_x - i r_y)/2], [(r_x + i r_y)/2, (1 - r_z)/2 ]]. Because σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]].

Our given ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So let's set the two equal:

(1/2) * [ [1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y ], [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z ] ] = [ [0.5, 0], [0, 0.5] ]

So each component must be equal. Let's write down the equations:

(1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

Then, the off-diagonal terms: (r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0, and (r_x + i r_y)/2 = 0.

Wait, the off-diagonal elements in our ρ are zero, so:

(r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0 → r_x - i r_y = 0.

Similarly, the other off-diagonal term is the same because it's the conjugate, so it's also zero.

So from r_x - i r_y =0, we can write r_x = i r_y. But r_x and r_y are real numbers because they're components of the Bloch vector. So the only solution is r_x =0 and r_y=0.

So putting it all together, r_z is 0, and r_x, r_y are zero. So the Bloch vector r is (0, 0, 0).

Wait wait, but the options are given as r=(1,1,0), (0,0,1), etc. So the only option with all zeros is option C.

So the position is at the origin in the Bloch sphere. That makes sense because if the density matrix is maximally mixed, it's the completely mixed state, which is at the center of the Bloch sphere.

So the correct answer should be option C, r=(0,0,0).

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix of a qubit can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing the two expressions for \(\rho\), we find that 

\[
\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0,
\]

which implies that all components of \(\mathbf{r}\) must be zero. Thus, the Bloch vector is 

\[
\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0).
\]

This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is located at the center of the Bloch sphere. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) \(r = (1,1,0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0,0,1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0,0,0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1,1,1)\)**  

The correct choice is **C**, as the Bloch vector is \((0,0,0)\).
