Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with some numbers in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. But how exactly? Oh right, the formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ), but τ is the mean lifetime, right? Or wait, sometimes it's the proper lifetime, which is τ, and then the observed lifetime is γτ. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, no, the mean decay distance L is given by L = c * τ, but I think I need to account for relativistic effects. Because the particle is moving at a high speed. So maybe it's L = v * τ, but v is the particle's velocity. Alternatively, since v is close to c, maybe we can approximate v ≈ c. So then L ≈ c * τ.

But wait, how do I find τ from the given data? I remember that the width Γ is related to the lifetime. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! Γ is the total decay width, and it's inversely proportional to the lifetime. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ. Oh wait, actually, the lifetime τ is ħ divided by Γ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait wait, the units here are in GeV and MeV. I need to make sure everything is in consistent units. Let me think. ħ has units of GeV·seconds, right? Or wait, no, because ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and Planck's constant is about 6.626e-34 J·s, but when converted to eV·s, it's about 6.626e-34 * 1e6 eV·s^{-1} (since 1 J = 1e6 eV). Wait, let me get the exact value. Oh yeah, ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So when Γ is in GeV, then τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but in this problem, Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ_X = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ_X. Plugging in the numbers, τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV. Let me compute that. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is about 2.056875e-24 seconds.

But wait, another thought: the decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. So yeah, that's correct.

Once I have τ, I need to find the distance the particle travels before decaying. So the mean decay length L is velocity times lifetime, L = v * τ. But since the particle is moving at a relativistic speed, I should perhaps consider the velocity as a fraction of c, but maybe in this problem, an approximation is used.

Alternatively, another approach: since the particle has a certain energy E, we can find its velocity. But wait, the production energy is 8 GeV, but the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the energy is much higher than the rest mass. So the particle is ultra-relativistic, meaning v ≈ c. So we can approximate v as c, so L ≈ c * τ.

Wait, but E is the total energy, which is gamma * m c². So gamma is E/(m c²). But since m is 1.2 GeV/c², and E is 8 GeV, gamma would be 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So gamma is about 6.6667.

But wait, if the particle is moving at that gamma factor, then its velocity is beta * c, where beta is v/c. So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)). Wait, no, the correct relation between gamma and beta is gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Let me compute that with gamma = 8/(1.2) = 6.6667.

So gamma = 6.6667. So 1/gamma² is about 1/(44.444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 1/gamma² ≈ 0.9775. So beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887, meaning v ≈ 0.9887 c. So it's pretty close to c, but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, using v = c is acceptable as an approximation. Alternatively, the problem might just use beta ≈ 1, so v ≈ c.

So, if I proceed with v ≈ c, then L = c * τ. So L = c * (ħ / Γ). Let's compute that.

c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So, putting it all together:

L = c * ħ / Γ_X

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ_X is 0.32 GeV.

So, L = (3e8 m/s) * (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV)

The GeV units cancel out. Let's compute the numbers.

First, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approx 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply by 3e8 m/s:

2.056875e-24 s * 3e8 m/s = 6.1706e-16 meters.

Wait, that's 6.17e-16 meters. But looking at the options, the numbers are in the 1e-15 or 1e-16 range.

Wait, the options are:

A) 5.0223e-16 m

B) 4.0655e-15 m

C)5.0223e-15 m

D)4.0655e-16 m

Hmm, my calculation gave about 6.17e-16, which is higher than option A (5.02e-16) but lower than option D (4.06e-16). Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should be precise with the numbers.

Compute 6.582e-25 / 0.32.

Let me do that: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. Let me compute this.

6.582 / 0.32 = approximately 20.56875.

So 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Multiply by c: 3e8 m/s.

2.056875e-24 * 3e8 = 6.170625e-16 meters.

Hmm, that's about 6.17e-16 m. But the options don't have this value. Closest is A) ~5e-16, D) ~4e-16. So I must have done something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to consider the velocity isn't exactly c. Earlier, I approximated v as c, but perhaps I should use beta * c.

Earlier, I calculated beta as approximately 0.9887, so v = 0.9887 c. So L = v * tau = beta * c * tau.

So let me recalculate with beta.

Gamma is E/(m c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)) = sqrt(1 - (1/(44.444))) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ approx 0.9887.

So L = beta * c * (ħ / Γ_X) = 0.9887 * (3e8 m/s) * (6.582e-25 GeV·s)/(0.32 GeV).

So same as before, the GeV cancels, so:

0.9887 * 3e8 * (6.582e-25 /0.32 )

Compute 6.582e-25 /0.32 = 2.056875e-24.

Multiply by 3e8: 2.056875e-24 * 3e8 = 6.170625e-16.

Then multiply by 0.9887: 6.1706e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.103e-16 m.

Hmm, that's about 6.1e-16 m, which still isn't matching any of the options. So maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the velocity as (E c^2)/(p c^2 + E^2) or something else. Wait, no, perhaps I should compute the velocity more accurately. Or, wait, maybe the particle's lifetime isn't just τ, but τ multiplied by gamma, because from the lab frame, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation.

Wait, I think I got that earlier. So the mean lifetime τ' in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime τ. Because the proper lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ, and Γ is the total decay width. So the lab frame lifetime is τ_lab = gamma * τ.

Wait, that makes sense. Because from the lab frame, the particle is moving, so its lifetime is longer due to time dilation. So when calculating the mean decay length, L = v * τ_lab = v * gamma * τ.

So putting it all together, L = v * gamma * τ.

But τ is ħ / Γ. So L = v * gamma * (ħ / Γ).

But since v = beta c, and gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), we can express it as:

L = beta c * gamma * ħ / Γ.

Wait, but beta * gamma is equal to gamma^2 * beta. Because gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), so beta * gamma = gamma * beta.

Wait, let's think about this. We have:

beta * gamma = (v/c) * gamma.

Hmm, but perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me think: beta = v/c, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So beta * gamma = gamma^2 * beta.

Wait, let me compute beta * gamma:

beta * gamma = (v/c) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ) = (v/c) / sqrt( (c² - v²)/c² ) ) = (v/c) / ( sqrt(c² - v²)/c ) ) = (v/c) * c / sqrt(c² - v²) ) = v / sqrt(c² - v²) ).

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute everything numerically.

Given that gamma is 6.6667, and beta is approximately 0.9887.

So L = beta * gamma * c * (ħ / Γ_X).

So:

beta = 0.9887

gamma = 6.6667

c = 3e8 m/s

ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s

Γ_X = 0.32 GeV

So let's compute each part:

beta * gamma = 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.591.

Then, c * (ħ/Γ_X) is 3e8 m/s * (6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV) = 3e8 * (6.582e-25 / 0.32) m.

6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24.

Multiply by 3e8: 2.056875e-24 * 3e8 = 6.170625e-16 meters.

Now, multiply by beta * gamma (≈6.591):

6.170625e-16 m * 6.591 ≈ 4.07e-15 meters.

Oh wait, that's close to option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

So about 4.07e-15 meters, which is 4.07 × 10^-15 m. That's option B.

Wait, but wait, let's compute it more accurately.

Compute beta * gamma:

beta = 0.9887, gamma = 6.6667.

So 0.9887 * 6.6667 = let's compute that exactly.

Wait, 6.6667 is approximately 20/3. 20/3 is about 6.6667.

So 0.9887 * (20/3) = (0.9887 * 20) / 3.

0.9887 * 20 = 19.774.

19.774 /3 ≈ 6.5913.

So 6.5913.

Now, 6.170625e-16 m * 6.5913 ≈ ?

Let me compute 6.170625e-16 *6.5913.

6.170625 *6.5913 = approximately:

6 *6.5913 = 39.5478.

0.170625 *6.5913: let's compute that.

0.170625 *6 =1.02375.

0.170625 *0.5913≈0.1010.

Total ≈1.02375 + 0.1010=1.12475.

So total is 39.5478 +1.12475=40.67255.

So 40.67255e-16 m =4.067255e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.067e-15 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So the correct answer should be option B.

But wait, why did I get a much larger number earlier when I didn't consider gamma? Because I forgot that the lifetime in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation, so the decay length is longer than what I initially calculated.

Let me recap the steps to make sure:

1. Calculate the proper lifetime τ = ħ / Γ_X.

2. The lab frame lifetime is τ_lab = gamma * τ.

3. The decay length L = v * τ_lab = beta c * gamma * tau = beta gamma c tau.

4. Substitute tau with ħ / Γ: L = beta gamma c (ħ / Γ).

Yes, that's the formula.

So L = (beta gamma) * (c ħ) / (Γ).

So plugging in the numbers, beta gamma is approximately 6.5913, c is 3e8 m/s, ħ 6.582e-25 GeV·s, Γ 0.32 GeV.

So L = (6.5913) * (3e8 m/s * 6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV.

Wait, more accurately:

c * ħ = 3e8 m/s * 6.582e-25 GeV·s = 1.9746e-16 GeV·m.

Then, 1.9746e-16 GeV·m / 0.32 GeV = 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by beta gamma (6.5913): 6.170625e-16 m *6.5913 ≈4.067e-15 m.

Which is 4.067e-15 m. The option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close.

So I think option B is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle,
- \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) is the reduced Planck constant,
- \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) is the total decay width.

### Step 1: Compute \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is given by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s}}{0.32 \, \text{GeV}} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} = \frac{8 \, \text{GeV}}{1.2 \, \text{GeV}} = 6.6667.
\]

The velocity \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau.
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( \beta \gamma = 0.9887 \times 6.6667 \approx 6.5913 \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \),

we calculate:

\[
L = 6.5913 \times (3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}).
\]

First, compute \( c \tau \):

\[
c \tau = (3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}) = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]

Now, multiply by \( \beta \gamma \):

\[
L = 6.5913 \times 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m} \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The closest option to \( 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).**

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
