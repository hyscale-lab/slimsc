Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, right? And the light is coming towards the observer because the glass is moving towards them. Interesting.

I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. There's that famous equation for velocity addition. Oh right, the formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²), but since c is 1 here, it's (u + v)/(1 + u v). But wait, is that correct? Or is it when adding the velocities of two frames?

Wait, no. Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The light is inside the glass, which is moving. So what's the speed of light in the glass? Normally, in a medium, the speed is c/n. But wait, in the lab frame, how does that work when the medium itself is moving?

So I think the key here is to think about how the speed of light in the medium is measured in the lab frame when the medium is moving. Because the medium's motion affects the observed speed.

Wait, but according to special relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame is always c. So wait, no, that can't be right because in this case, the light is moving through a medium (glass) which has a refractive index n. So the speed of light in the glass in the glass's rest frame is c/n. But when the glass is moving, how does that affect the measured speed?

Alternatively, perhaps we can treat this as a case where we have to apply the velocity addition formula to the speed of light in the medium's frame.

Wait, the light's speed in the glass's frame is u = c/n. Then, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So the lab would measure the light's speed as (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c² ). But since u is c/n, substituting gives [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + (c/n * v) / c² ].

Wait, let me calculate that. Let's write it down.

u_lab = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² )

Since c is 1, denominator becomes 1 + u v.

So u_lab = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (c v)/(n) )

But wait, since c is 1, it's (1 + n v )/( n + v ). Because numerator: (1/n + v), denominator (1 + v/(n)).

Wait, let me see:

Numerator: (1/n + v) → (1 + n v)/n.

Denominator: 1 + v/(n) → (n + v)/n.

So u_lab = [ (1 + n v)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ].

The n's cancel out, leaving (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Wait, but hold on. The options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A is (1 +n*v)/(n+v). That's what I got.

Option B is 1. That can't be right because the light is moving in a medium.

Option C: (1 +n v)/(n -v) → denominator has n -v, which would be if v was in the opposite direction.

Option D is (1 -n v)/(n +v), which would be negative if n v is more than 1, but speed can't be negative.

Hmm. So the calculation suggests option A is correct.

Wait, but another thought: since the glass is moving towards the lab observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, but the speed in the lab frame is c/n. Or is it? Wait, no, because in the lab's frame, the glass is moving, so the light's velocity can't exceed c, right?

Wait, if the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light, then the light's speed relative to the lab would be (u + v)/(1 + u v), which is what I did before.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Normally, the speed of light in the medium is c/n. So in the medium's frame, it's c/n. When the medium is moving with velocity v, the lab frame would measure the speed as velocity addition: (c/n + v) / (1 + (c/n v)/c²). Wait, but since c=1, that's ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (v)/(n) ) as above.

So yeah, same result. So the speed of light in the lab is (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Looking back at the options, that's option A. But wait, I'm a bit confused. What if the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion? Then the light's speed relative to the lab would be higher than in the medium's frame.

Wait, but in this case, the light is moving through the glass, which is moving. So the light's speed in the lab frame is what's being asked. So yes, the formula I used should apply.

So the correct answer would be option A.

To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we apply the relativistic velocity addition formula. The light's speed in the glass's rest frame is \( u = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( c = 1 \) and \( n \) is the refractive index. The glass itself is moving at velocity \( v \) relative to the lab in the same direction as the light beam. Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u_{\text{lab}} = \frac{u + v}{1 + uv}
\]

Substituting \( u = \frac{1}{n} \), we get:

\[
u_{\text{lab}} = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Simplifying the numerator and denominator:

\[
u_{\text{lab}} = \frac{\frac{1 + nv}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}} = \frac{1 + nv}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is \( \frac{1 + nv}{n + v} \).

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: \( \frac{1 + nv}{n + v} \) matches the derived result.
- **Option B**: \( 1 \) is incorrect because it does not account for the refractive index or the motion of the glass.
- **Option C**: \( \frac{1 + nv}{n - v} \) is incorrect because the denominator \( n - v \) would apply if the glass were moving in the opposite direction.
- **Option D**: \( \frac{1 - nv}{n + v} \) is incorrect because it introduces a negative sign, which is unphysical for speed.

The correct answer is therefore:

**Answer: A**
