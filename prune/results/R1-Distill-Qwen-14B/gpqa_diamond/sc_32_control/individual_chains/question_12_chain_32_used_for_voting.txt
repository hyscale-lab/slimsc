Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. 

The given reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu, where Pi(+) is at rest. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, with different KE values for the products.

Hmm, I remember that in particle decay problems, conservation of energy and momentum are key. Since the pion is at rest initially, the total momentum before the decay is zero. So after the decay, the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to keep the total momentum zero. Interesting.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass. Oh, right, in many cases, we treat them as massless particles, which simplifies things. So the muon would carry away some kinetic energy, and the neutrino the rest, but I'm not sure exactly how to calculate it.

Let me think about the energies involved. The rest mass of the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so we can ignore it for this calculation.

So the energy released in the decay is the difference in rest masses between the pion and the muon. That would be 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV. But wait, I think that's just the rest mass difference, but the kinetic energies would be part of that.

Wait, no. The total energy available is the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. The muon's rest energy is 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino's rest energy is zero. So the total energy after decay is the sum of the muon's energy (which includes its rest mass and KE) and the neutrino's energy (all KE, since its mass is zero).

So energy conservation says: Energy before decay = Energy after decay. The energy before is just the pion's rest energy, so 139.6 MeV. The energy after is E_mu + E_nu. E_mu is its rest mass plus KE_mu, and E_nu is all KE_nu because it's massless.

So 139.6 = (105.7 + KE_mu) + KE_nu.

And from momentum conservation, since the pion is at rest, the momenta of mu and nu must be equal and opposite. So the magnitudes of their momenta are the same.

So p_mu = p_nu.

But for the muon, which has mass, the energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). Since c is a constant and we're working in units where c=1, that simplifies to E_mu = sqrt( p_mu^2 + m_mu^2 ).

The neutrino's energy is E_nu = p_nu c (again, c=1), so E_nu = p_mu.

So putting these together, E_mu = sqrt(p_mu^2 + m_mu^2) and E_nu = p_mu.

So substituting into the energy equation:

139.6 = sqrt(p_mu^2 + 105.7^2) + p_mu.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but perhaps I can square both sides to solve for p_mu. Let me denote p_mu as p for simplicity.

So 139.6 = sqrt(p^2 + 105.7^2) + p.

Let me subtract p from both sides:

139.6 - p = sqrt(p^2 + 105.7^2).

Now square both sides:

(139.6 - p)^2 = p^2 + 105.7^2.

Expanding the left side:

139.6^2 - 2*139.6*p + p^2 = p^2 + (105.7)^2.

Simplify by subtracting p^2 from both sides:

139.6^2 - 2*139.6*p = 105.7^2.

Calculate the squares:

139.6^2 is approximately 139.6 * 139.6. Let me do that calculation. 140^2 is 19600, so subtract 0.4*2*140 + 0.4^2. Wait no, better to compute 139.6 squared.

Wait, 139.6 * 139.6: Let's compute it as (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2. 140^2 is 19600. 2*140*0.4 is 112. 0.4^2 is 0.16. So 19600 - 112 = 19488, plus 0.16? No wait, wait: (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b². So 140² = 19600. 2ab = 2*140*0.4 = 112. So 19600 - 112 = 19488. Then plus (0.4)^2 = 0.16. So 19488 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

Similarly, 105.7^2: Let me compute that. 100^2 is 10000. 5.7^2 is 32.49. The cross term is 2*100*5.7= 1140. So (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49.

So substituting back:

19488.16 - 2*139.6 * p = 11172.49.

Subtract 11172.49 from both sides:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 2*139.6 * p.

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49. Let's subtract:

19488.16
-11172.49
= ?

19488 - 11172 is 8316. The decimal part: 0.16 - 0.49 = -0.33. So 8316 - 0.33 = 8315.67? Wait, actually, wait: 19488.16 minus 11172.49.

Wait, 19488.16 minus 11172 is 8316.16, then minus 0.49: 8315.67. So 8315.67 = 2*139.6 * p.

So 2*139.6 is 279.2.

So 8315.67 = 279.2 * p.

p = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me calculate that. 279.2 * 30 is 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So 29.8 maybe? Let's see:

279.2 * 29.8 = ?

Wait, maybe exact division is better. Let me compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Approximately, 279.2 * 29.8 = 279.2*(30 - 0.2) = 8376 - (0.2 * 279.2) = 8376 - 55.84 = 8320.16.

Wait, 8320.16 is close to 8315.67. So perhaps 29.8 is a bit too high. Let's compute 279.2 * 29.7.

29.7 * 279.2 = ?

= (30 -0.3) *279.2 = 8376 - 0.3*279.2.

0.3 * 279.2 = 83.76.

So 8376 - 83.76 = 8292.24.

But we have 8315.67, which is 8315.67 -8292.24 = 23.43 higher. So 29.7 gives 8292.24, and 29.8 gives 8320.16. Our target is 8315.67. So the difference between 29.7 and 29.8 is 0.1, which causes a difference of 8320.16 -8292.24 = 27.92. So how much more than 29.7 do we need to reach 8315.67?

The needed increase from 8292.24 is 8315.67 -8292.24 = 23.43.

So 23.43 / 279.2 per 0.1 adjustment. Wait, no, 0.1 increase in p adds 27.92 to the product. So 23.43 /27.92 = approx 0.84. So p ≈ 29.7 + 0.084 = 29.784 ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait. Because the equation is p = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

So 279.2 * 29 = 8100 - let me see. 279.2 * 29.

279.2 *30 = 8376, so 279.2 *29 = 8376 -279.2 = 8096.8.

Then, 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

So how many 279.2 into 218.87? 218.87 /279.2 ≈ 0.782.

So p ≈ 29.782. So about 29.78 MeV/c.

But wait, let's see. So p is approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

Now, E_nu is p, so 29.78 MeV.

Then E_mu is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.78^2: approx 887 (since 30^2 is 900, so 29.78^2 ≈ (30 -0.22)^2 ≈ 900 - 2*30*0.22 + 0.22^2 = 900 - 13.2 + 0.0484= 886.8484.

105.7^2 is 11172.49.

So E_mu = sqrt(886.85 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.34) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So E_mu = 109.81 MeV, which is rest mass (105.7) plus KE_mu. So KE_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

Wait, so KE_mu is approximately 4.11 MeV, and KE_nu is 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

That's very close. So KE_mu is about 4.12, and KE_nu 29.8.

So the correct answer should be option D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

### Reaction and Conservation Laws
The given reaction is:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

Here, the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is initially at rest, and the neutrino (\(\nu\)) is treated as massless. Conservation of energy and momentum must be applied:

1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion, \(E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\). After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's energy (\(E_{\mu^+}\)) and the neutrino's energy (\(E_\nu\)):

   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu
   \]

   The muon's energy is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy:

   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = m_{\mu^+} c^2 + K_{\mu^+}
   \]

   Substituting, we get:

   \[
   139.6 = (105.7 + K_{\mu^+}) + E_\nu
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   Since the pion is at rest, the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal and opposite:

   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu
   \]

   For the muon, energy is related to momentum by:

   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}
   \]

   For the neutrino, since it is massless:

   \[
   E_\nu = p_\nu = p_{\mu^+}
   \]

### Solving for Momentum and Energies
Substituting \(E_\nu = p_{\mu^+}\) and \(E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}\) into the energy conservation equation:

\[
139.6 = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + 105.7^2} + p_{\mu^+}
\]

Let \(p = p_{\mu^+}\). Rearranging:

\[
139.6 - p = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2}
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
(139.6 - p)^2 = p^2 + 105.7^2
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p + p^2 = p^2 + 105.7^2
\]

\[
139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p = 105.7^2
\]

Substitute \(139.6^2 = 19488.16\) and \(105.7^2 = 11172.49\):

\[
19488.16 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p = 11172.49
\]

\[
2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p = 19488.16 - 11172.49
\]

\[
2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p = 8315.67
\]

\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{2 \cdot 139.6} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV/c}
\]

Now, calculate the kinetic energies:

1. **Neutrino's Kinetic Energy**:  
   Since \(E_\nu = p\), the neutrino's kinetic energy is:

   \[
   K_\nu = E_\nu = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

2. **Muon's Kinetic Energy**:  
   The muon's total energy is:

   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2}
   \]

   Compute \(29.78^2 \approx 886.85\) and \(105.7^2 = 11172.49\):

   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{886.85 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.34} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

   Subtract the muon's rest energy:

   \[
   K_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.11 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.78 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options:

- **Option D**: \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV}\) is the closest match.
