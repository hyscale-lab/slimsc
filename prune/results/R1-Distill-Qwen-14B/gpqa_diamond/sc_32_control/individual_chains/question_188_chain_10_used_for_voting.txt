Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal and all angles the same, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms and all the angles α, β, γ as 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance... Oh right, that's the d-spacing. I think the formula for calculating d-spacing in a crystal is the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the Miller indices multiplied by some factors involving the lattice parameters and the angles.

The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal structure is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α)}}}

Wait, no, maybe I got that a bit wrong. I recall that the formula for a rhombohedral (or cubic, which is a special case) crystal might have a more specific form. Oh right, in a cubic system, the formula simplifies because all angles are 90 degrees, but here the angles are 30 degrees.

Wait, the rhombohedral system is a type of hexagonal crystal system? Or is it part of the cubic system? No, I think it's a subclass of the cubic system where all edges are equal and all angles equal but not 90 degrees. So for a rhombohedral lattice, the unit cell is a rhombohedron.

The Miller indices given are (111), so h=k=l=1. So plugging that into the formula.

Wait, but what is the exact formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system? Let me think. I think the general formula for d-spacing in a cubic system is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but in a rhombohedral system, the angles come into play because the axes aren't orthogonal.

I think the formula is d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) ) )

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, all three angles α, β, γ are equal, right? So in this problem, α=β=γ=30 degrees. So cos 30 is sqrt(3)/2 approximately 0.866.

So substituting h=k=l=1.

The denominator becomes sqrt( (1+1+1) + 2*(1*1 * cos 30) *3 terms? Wait, wait, let's compute it step by step.

The denominator is sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos γ + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos α )

Since all angles are 30 degrees:

Denominator = sqrt(3 + 2*(1*1 * cos30)*3)

Wait, because each of the cross terms is 2hk cosγ, etc. So in this case, since h=k=l=1, each of the cross terms is 2*(1)(1)*cos30. There are three such terms: hk, hl, and kl. So each contributes 2*(1)(1)*cos30.

So the sum inside the square root is:

3 (from h² + k² + l²) plus 3*(2 * cos30).

Wait, wait no. Let me compute each part.

h² +k² + l² = 1 +1 +1 =3.

Now the cross terms: 2hk cosγ + 2hl cosβ + 2kl cosα.

Each of these terms is 2*(1)(1)*cos30, and since all three are the same, it's 3*(2 * cos30).

So the sum is 3 + (3 * 2 * cos30) ) = 3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) ) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3).

So denominator is sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)).

So d = a / sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3) )

But wait, wait a second. What is a here? The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. In a rhombohedral crystal, is a the lattice parameter, which is the edge length of the rhombohedron?

Yes, I think so. So a is 10 Angstroms.

So d = 10 / sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

Let me compute the denominator numerically.

Compute 3 +3*sqrt(3) first.

sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732.

3*sqrt(3) is about 5.196.

So 3 +5.196 =8.196.

So denominator is sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

So d ≈ 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.492 Angstroms? Wait, that can't be right because the options are in the 8-10 range.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Did I do something wrong here?

Wait wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is not the lattice parameter a. Hmm, maybe I misapplied the formula.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the interatomic distance is the distance between two adjacent atoms, which in a crystal structure corresponds to the lattice parameter a in some cases, but perhaps not here. Wait, in a simple cubic structure, a is the distance between adjacent atoms. But in a rhombohedral structure, which is like a sheared cubic, perhaps the interatomic distance is along the (100) direction, but the lattice parameter is a.

Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps in this case, a is 10 Angstrom.

Wait but when I computed d, I got about 3.49 Angstroms, which is way lower than any of the options. So that suggests I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should be using a different formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a rhombohedral system which is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \alpha } }

Wait, but in that case, since all angles are the same, perhaps it's:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, but wait, in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the axes are all equal, but the relationships between the vectors are more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d² = (a² (h² +k² + l²) + 2a² (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α )) / (1 + 2 (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α ) + ... )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, in a rhombohedral system, the lattice can be considered as a cube that has been stretched along one of the diagonals, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the general formula for d-spacing in a triclinic system and then apply it here.

The general formula for d-spacing in a triclinic crystal is:

d_{hkl}^2 = (a^2 (h² + k² + l²) + b^2 ( ... ) ) / ( ... )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of reciprocal space.

Wait, maybe another approach. The interplanar distance for (hkl) in a crystal is given by:

1/d^2 = (h^2 +k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) + 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α)/(a^2)

Wait, no, I'm not confident. Let me think again.

Wait, I found a resource before that in a rhombohedral system, the formula can be written as:

1/d_{hkl}^2 = (h^2 +k^2 +l^2)/(a^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α / a^2

But wait, that can't be right because the angles between the axes are not 90 degrees. So I think the correct formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²) / a² + 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) / a²

Since in this case, all angles are 30 degrees, so cos α = cos β = cos γ = cos30 ≈ 0.866.

So substituting, for (111):

1/d² = (1 + 1 + 1)/a² + 2( (1)(1) cos30 + (1)(1) cos30 + (1)(1) cos30 ) / a²

So that's (3)/a² + 2*(3 * 0.866)/a²

Wait, 2*(3 * cos30) = 6*(0.866) ≈5.196.

So 3 +5.196 =8.196. So 1/d² = 8.196 / (a²).

But a is 10 Angstroms, so a² is 100.

So 1/d² =8.196 /100 → 0.08196.

So d²=1/0.08196 ≈12.20. So d ≈ sqrt(12.20) ≈3.49 Angstroms.

Wait, same as before. But the options are in 8-10 Angstroms. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is a/√3. Wait, in a cubic close-packed structure, the interatomic distance is a√2/2 for fcc, but I'm getting off track.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing a with the interatomic distance. Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Hmm, maybe in a rhombohedral system, the a is not the same as the interatomic distance. Oh, wait, in a simple cubic structure, a is the interatomic distance along the cube edges. But in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance in a different direction might be given as 10 Angstrom.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between nearest neighbors, which in a rhombohedral lattice would be along a certain direction. Let me think about the structure.

In a rhombohedral lattice, each atom is surrounded by six others (if it's a simple structure), but the arrangement might be different. The nearest neighbor distance might not be a, but a different function of a and the angles.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the nearest neighbor distance. In a simple cubic, the nearest neighbor distance is a√1, but in a different system, it could be different.

Wait, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is a√(something). Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance, which could be a√(1 + 2 cos α), considering the vectors.

Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the vectors could be a, a, a, and the angles between them are α. So the distance between nearest neighbors can be found using the vectors.

Wait, the position vectors for atoms could be at (0,0,0), (a,0,0), (0,a,0), (0,0,a), etc., but in a rhombohedral system, the axes are not orthogonal.

Hmm, perhaps the distance between (0,0,0) and (1,1,1) is not a√3, but a different value.

Wait, the distance between two points in a rhombohedral lattice would be calculated using the lattice vectors. Let me think: the distance between (0,0,0) and (a, a, a) would be sqrt( (a)^2 + (a)^2 + (a)^2 + 2a² (cos α + cos β + cos γ) ) ), but since all angles are 30 degrees, it's:

sqrt(3a² + 2a² (3 * cos30) ) = a * sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2)) ) = a * sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, but this is the distance between two (1,1,1) points, but that's not the nearest neighbor distance. The nearest neighbor would probably be along the (1,0,0), (0,1,0), or (0,0,1) directions. Wait, but in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbors aren't along the axes because of the angles.

Alternatively, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is a√(1 + 2 cos α). For example, the distance between (0,0,0) and (1,1,0) would be sqrt( a² + a² + 2a² cos α ), assuming the angle between the first two axes is α.

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the angle between each pair of axes is alpha. So the vectors a, b, c have angles alpha between each other.

So the displacement vector from (0,0,0) to (1,1,0) in terms of the lattice vectors would be a + b. The length squared would be |a + b|² = a² + b² + 2ab cosθ, where θ is the angle between a and b, which is alpha.

Assuming a = b = c = a (since rhombohedral has all edges equal), then |a + b|² = 2a² + 2a² cos alpha.

So distance is a*sqrt(2(1+cos alpha)).

Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Let's suppose that the nearest neighbor distance is this value, 10 Angstroms. So 10 = a * sqrt(2(1 + cos30)).

So a = 10 / sqrt(2(1 + cos30)).

Compute that:

cos30 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

1 + cos30 ≈1.866.

2*(1.866)=3.732.

sqrt(3.732)=~1.932.

a=10 / 1.932 ≈5.175 Angstroms.

Hmm, but then when I calculated d earlier, I used a=10, which gave d≈3.49, but that's not matching any options. But if a is actually about 5.175, then let's recalculate d.

Wait, but perhaps my assumption is wrong. Maybe the interatomic distance is a, not the nearest neighbor distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is stating that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, which is the lattice parameter a. So if a=10, then the nearest neighbor distance is a*sqrt(2(1+ cos alpha)).

But regardless, perhaps the confusion arises because I might be using a as the lattice parameter or the nearest neighbor distance.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the initial formula, considering a=10, and see if any calculation mistake happened.

Wait, when I computed the denominator earlier, sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)) is about sqrt(8.196) ≈2.863. So 10 /2.863 ≈3.49 Angstroms. But the options are all around 9 Angstroms.

Wait, that's a big discrepancy. So perhaps I messed up the formula. Maybe the formula for d-spacing is 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²) / a² + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) / a².

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, perhaps the formula is different. Another thought: maybe the angles are 30 degrees, but they are in the Miller indices formula in a specific way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a way to compute the reciprocal lattice vectors or use the general formula for d-spacing.

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice is also rhombohedral. The formula for d-spacing is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h a*)² + (k b*)² + (l c*)² )

But in a rhombohedral system, a* = a/(V) * (something with the angles), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps use the formula:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \alpha }} } \times \frac{1}{a}

Wait, but that brings me back to the same result as before.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the correct formula but the given interatomic distance is not a, but something else.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the interatomic distance is given along the (100) direction, which would be a, so a=10 Angstroms.

Wait, but in that case, my earlier calculation gives d=3.49, which is not matching any options.

But the options are all around 9 Angstroms, which is about 3 times a. So maybe the formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² + l²)/(a²) × something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk + hl + kl)/(a²) × cos(30).

Wait, but that's the same as before.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Maybe the correct formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )^{-1}

Wait, but that's what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it again carefully.

Compute the denominator:

h² +k² +l² =3.

Each cross term is hk. So 3 cross terms, each 1*1=1.

So 2*(hk + hl + kl)*cos30 = 2*(3)* (sqrt(3)/2) ) = 3*sqrt(3) ≈5.196.

So denominator inside the square root: 3 +5.196 ≈8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈2.863.

So d= a / 2.863.

If a=10, then d≈3.49.

But the options are much higher. So perhaps the interatomic distance isn't a, but something else.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming a is the interatomic distance. Maybe a is the distance along the axis, but the interatomic distance is in a different direction.

Wait, let's think: in a rhombohedral structure, the atoms are at the corners of a rhombohedron. The distance between adjacent atoms (nearest neighbors) might not be a. So perhaps the given 10 Angstrom is the nearest neighbor distance.

So if the nearest neighbor distance is 10, let's compute a.

In a rhombohedral system, the nearest neighbor distance is along the vector (1,1,0) or similar. Wait, earlier I thought it might be (1,1,0), but perhaps in reality the nearest neighbor could be along (1,0,0) or (0,1,0), but considering the angles, that might not be the case.

Wait, perhaps the distance between (0,0,0) and (1,0,0) is a (since it's along the a-axis), but the angle between the a and b axes is 30 degrees. So the distance between (1,0,0) and (0,1,0) would be sqrt( a² + a² + 2a² cos30 ) = a * sqrt(2 + 2 cos30) ≈a * sqrt(2 + 1.732) = a * sqrt(3.732) ≈a*1.932.

Wait, that would be the distance between (1,0,0) and (0,1,0), which are not nearest neighbors. The nearest neighbors would be along the edges.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let's try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is along the (1,1,1) direction. But that's unlikely because (1,1,1) is a diagonal, which would have a longer distance.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a formula that relates the d-spacing to the given parameters.

Wait, I found a resource online that says the formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2hk \cos \gamma + 2hl \cos \beta + 2kl \cos \alpha}}

Assuming that, and since all angles are 30 degrees, this simplifies to:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos30 )

For (111), h=k=l=1:

d = a / sqrt(3 + 6 * 0.866 )

Compute denominator:

3 + 6*0.866 ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

Sqrt(8.196) ≈2.863.

So d≈a/2.863.

If a=10, d≈3.49 Angstroms, which isn't among the options.

But the options are all around 9 Angstroms. So maybe a is not 10, but perhaps something else.

Wait, the problem states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So maybe a is 10, but perhaps in a different way.

Wait, perhaps a is the interatomic distance along a certain direction, but in the (100) direction, so a=10.

Wait, but that brings us back to the same calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha ) / a².

Wait, no, that's what I did earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / (sqrt( ... )) but I messed up the calculation.

Wait, another way: Let me compute the denominator numerically.

Compute the denominator:

3 + 6 * cos30.

cos30=0.8660.

6 * 0.8660 =5.196.

So 3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So d=10 /2.863≈3.49 Angstroms.

But that's not matching any option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should consider that in a rhombohedral system, the formula is different.

Wait, I think I found a different formula. Some sources say that for a rhombohedral system, the d-spacing is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 +k^2 + l^2 + 2hk(1 + cos alpha)}}.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's 2hk cos(alpha), but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me look for a general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system.

The general formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ \left( \frac{h}{a} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{k}{b} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{l}{c} \right)^2 + 2 \frac{hk \cos \gamma}{ab} + 2 \frac{hl \cos \beta}{ac} + 2 \frac{kl \cos \alpha}{bc} } } }

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a, and alpha=beta=gamma.

So substituting:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2)/a^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha / a^2 } }

Which can be rewritten as:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which is same as earlier.

So again, with h=k=l=1, cos alpha = cos30≈0.866.

So d = a / sqrt(3 + 6*0.866 ) = a / sqrt(8.196).

If a=10, d≈3.49.

But the options are all about 9 Angstroms, which is about 3 times higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating because I'm using a in the formula, but perhaps the given interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance, and that's along a different direction.

Wait, let me think: in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is given by the vector sum (1,1,0), (1,0,1), or (0,1,1), perhaps.

The distance for (1,1,0) would be sqrt( a² + a² + 2a² cos gamma ), since gamma is the angle between a and b axes. Wait, gamma is 30 degrees.

So distance d_nn= sqrt(2a² + 2a² cos30) =a*sqrt( 2 + 2 cos30 )

= a * sqrt(2(1 + cos30)).

If this is given as 10 Angstrom, then:

10 = a * sqrt( 2*(1 + sqrt(3)/2 )) 

Compute 2*(1 + sqrt(3)/2 )= 2 + sqrt(3) ≈2 +1.732=3.732.

sqrt(3.732)=1.932.

So a=10 /1.932≈5.175 Angstroms.

Now, with a=5.175, compute d for (111):

d= a / sqrt(3 +6*(0.866)) =5.175 / sqrt(8.196) =5.175 /2.863 ≈1.808 Angstroms.

Still not matching the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between (1,1,1) and (0,0,0), which would be a*sqrt(3 +6 cos30).

Wait, that would be for the (111) plane?

Wait, no, the (111) plane's d-spacing is given by the formula I've been using. But perhaps the given interatomic distance is along (111), so:

d_111 =10 Angstrom.

Then, using the formula:

10 = a / sqrt(3 + 6 cos30).

So solve for a:

a=10 * sqrt(3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2)).

Compute 3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2)= 3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So a=10 *2.863≈28.63 Angstroms.

Then, d for (111) is a /2.863=28.63/2.863≈10 Angstroms. But that would make the d-spacing 10, but that's not one of the options. So I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me list the given options and see which would fit the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(alpha) ).

But a is 10. So the denominator inside the square root is 3 +6*(0.866)=8.196, as before.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.49.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I have a fundamental misunderstanding.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I mixed up the angles. The angles in the formula are the angles between the crystallographic axes, but in the Miller indices formula, the angles are the angles between the reciprocal axes.

Wait, no, I think the formula uses the angles between the real axes. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is for a cubic system, but in a rhombohedral it's different.

Wait, another approach: perhaps use the formula for a cubic system, but with a modified 'a' value.

Wait, in cubic, d = a / sqrt(3) for (111).

But in this problem, the angles are 30 degrees, so it's not cubic. So perhaps the d-spacing is larger than the cubic case.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between (000) and (111), which would be sqrt( a² + a² + a² + 2a² (cos30 + cos30 + cos30) ) =a*sqrt(3 + 6 cos30).

Which is a*sqrt(3+5.196)= a*sqrt(8.196)=a*2.863.

So if that distance is 10 Angstroms, then a=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstroms.

Then with a=3.49, compute the (111) d-spacing.

d= a / sqrt(3 +6 cos30) =3.49 / 2.863≈1.219 Angstroms. Still not matching.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is not in the options, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

1/d² = (h² +k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(alpha)/(a²)

But that gives 1/d² = (3 +6*(0.866))/a² = (8.196)/a².

If a=10, 1/d²= 0.8196 → d=1.094√1 → d=0.317, which is way too small.

Wait, perhaps I should just compute the options. Let me compute each option's 1/d² and see if it matches the formula.

For option A: 9.08 Ang.

1/d² = 1/(9.08)^2 ≈1/82.45≈0.01213.

Compute 3 +6*0.866=8.196.

So, if a=10, then 8.196/100=0.08196.

But 0.08196 !=0.01213. So no.

Wait, perhaps I should set 8.196/a² =1/(d^2) → a²=8.196 d².

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't using the correct formula and the correct answer is option C, 9.54. Let me compute what 9.54 would give.

1/d²=1/(9.54^2)=1/91≈0.01099.

So 8.196/a²=0.01099 → a²=8.196/0.01099≈749.7 → a≈27.38 Angstroms.

But then, the interatomic distance would be a*sqrt(3 +6 cos30) → 27.38 *2.863≈78.4 Ang. Which is way larger than 10.

Hmm, that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the given interatomic distance is the lattice parameter a, and then compute d.

But that leads to d≈3.49, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is different. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, another formula I found online for a rhombohedral crystal is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Which is the same as what I did earlier.

But the result for a=10 is d≈3.49, which is not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is in error, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the denominator.

Wait, wait, perhaps the formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha, all divided by a².

So for a=10, denominator is 3 +6*(0.866)=8.196.

So 1/d²=8.196/100 →d= approx 1.094.

But that's still not matching any options.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the angles are 30 degrees, but the formula uses the supplementary angle, 150 degrees. Because in some cases, the angles in the formula are the angles between the reciprocal axes, which might be 180 - 30=150 degrees.

So cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2≈-0.866.

Let me try that.

Denominator becomes 3 +6*(-0.866)=3 -5.196 =-2.196.

Wait, that can't be right because the square root of a negative number isn't real. So that approach doesn't work.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is option A, 9.08 Angstroms. But I don't see how that comes about. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) ) × something.

But earlier that gives d= 10 / sqrt(3)≈5.77 Angstroms, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = (a) / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) ) ) / sqrt(1 + 2 cos alpha) )

Wait, but for (111), that would be:

d=10/(sqrt(3)) / sqrt(1+2*(0.866)).

Compute denominator: sqrt(3)=1.732, and sqrt(1+1.732)=sqrt(2.732)=1.652.

So d=10/(1.732 *1.652)=10/(2.863)=3.49 Angs. Still same result.

I think I'm out of ideas. Maybe I should pick the closest option, but none of them match. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula uses a different approach.

Wait, another formula I found online: for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d = a / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma ) )

But using the same approach, it's the same as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is option A: 9.08 Angstroms.

Wait, no, another thought: perhaps the interatomic distance is not a, but another parameter. Let me think: in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell volume is a³ * sqrt(1 - 3 cos30 + 3 cos²30).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume and see.

Volume V= a^3 * sqrt( 1 - 3 cos α + 3 cos²α )

But I'm not sure how this helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between (1,1,1) and (0,0,0), which would be a*sqrt(3 +6 cos30) →10= a*sqrt(8.196) →a=10/2.863≈3.49.

Then, the d-spacing for (111) would be a / sqrt(3 +6 cos30)=3.49/2.863≈1.219 Angs. Still not matching.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should accept that I'm not seeing the correct approach and choose based on calculation.

To determine the interplanar distance \( d_{111} \) for a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), we use the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha)}}
\]

For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \), and since all angles are \( 30^\circ \), we have \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \). Substituting these values:

1. Compute the terms in the denominator:
   - \( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3 \),
   - \( 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha) = 2(1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866) = 2(3 \cdot 0.866) = 5.196 \).

   Adding these gives:
   \[
   \text{Denominator inside the square root} = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196
   \]

2. Compute the square root:
   \[
   \sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863
   \]

3. Substitute into the formula for \( d_{111} \):
   \[
   d_{111} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{8.196}} = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
   \]

This result, \( d_{111} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \), does not match any of the provided options, which are all in the range of \( 8.95 \, \text{Å} \) to \( 10.05 \, \text{Å} \). This discrepancy suggests either a misunderstanding of the given parameters (e.g., whether \( a \) is the interatomic distance or another lattice parameter) or an issue with the interpretation of the problem.

Given the mismatch, and without further clarification, the most reasonable choice based on the options provided is:

**Answer: A**
