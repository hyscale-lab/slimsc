Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Lithium usually has 3 protons, so if it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, right? Because Li typically has an atomic number of 3. So, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, making its mass number 6.

So, the task is to find the energy of the RHIC. But wait, I remember that in particle physics, the energy of a particle in a collider is usually given as its kinetic energy, not the total energy. Or is it the total energy including rest mass? I'm a bit confused here. Let me think.

The problem says, what is the energy of RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. So, I think that the energy in this context refers to the total energy, which includes both kinetic and rest mass energy. Because when particles are accelerated to relativistic speeds, their total energy is gamma times their rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, first, I need to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy would be m*c². Let me calculate that. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus can be found using the atomic mass. Alternatively, I can approximate it using the mass number, since each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a mass of about 1 atomic mass unit (u), which is approximately 931.5 MeV/c² each.

Wait, so for Li-6: 6 nucleons. So 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV. So the rest mass energy is approximately 5.589 GeV. But wait, actually, the exact mass of Li-6 might be a bit less because when you form a nucleus, there's a mass defect due to binding energy. But for this problem, maybe we can approximate it as 6 * 931.5 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV. Or perhaps the question assumes that the mass is 6 u exactly, so 5.589 GeV.

Next, the speed is 0.96c, so I can compute gamma, the Lorentz factor. Gamma is given by 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's plug in v=0.96c.

So, v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me do that calculation precisely. 0.96 squared is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, so gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

So, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m c².

We have gamma ≈ 3.5714, and m c² is 5.589 GeV. So E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 multiplied by 5.589.

Breaking it down: 3 * 5.589 = 16.767. 0.5714 *5.589 ≈ ?

Wait, 0.5714 is approximately 4/7, but maybe exact calculation is better.

Wait, 5.589 * 3.5714 = ?

Let me compute 5.589 * 3 = 16.767.

5.589 * 0.5 = 2.7945.

5.589 * 0.0714 ≈ 5.589 * 0.07 is ~0.3912, and 5.589 * 0.0014 ≈ 0.00782. So total around 0.399.

Adding up: 16.767 + 2.7945 = 19.5615, plus 0.399 is about 19.9605 GeV.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can perform the multiplication more accurately.

Hmm, 5.589 * 3.5714.

Let me compute 5.589 * 3.5714.

But wait, 3.5714 is exactly 25/7, which is approximately 3.5714. So 25/7 = 3.57142857...

So, 5.589 * (25/7) = (5.589 *25 ) /7.

5.589 *25: 5 *25=125, 0.589 *25=14.725. So total 125 +14.725=139.725.

Divide by 7: 139.725 /7 ≈ 19.9607 GeV.

So around 19.96 GeV.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

So 19.96 is closest to option C (20.132) and option D (21.419). Hmm, but wait, perhaps my calculation approximated too much. Let me check the exact gamma factor.

v = 0.96c, so let's compute gamma more precisely.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

Compute (0.96)^2 is 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly? Wait wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, so yes, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

So exact gamma is 3.5714285714.

So, E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714285714 * 5.589 GeV.

Let me compute this more accurately.

5.589 * 3.5714285714.

Let me compute 5.589 * 3 = 16.767.

5.589 * 0.5714285714.

0.5714285714 is 4/7.

So 5.589 * (4/7) = (5.589 *4)/7 = 22.356 /7 ≈ 3.193714.

So total E = 16.767 + 3.193714 ≈ 19.9607 GeV.

So about 19.96 GeV.

But the options don't have 19.96. The closest ones are C) 20.132 and D) 21.419.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass. Maybe the mass of the Li-6 nucleus isn't 6 u exactly. Because when you have a nucleus, the mass is slightly less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons due to binding energy.

So, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, I remember that the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.014 atomic mass units. Because the atomic mass of Li is around 6.941 for the isotope Li-7, but Li-6 is lighter. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the precise value.

The standard atomic weight of Li is approximately 6.941 g/mol, but that's for the most common isotope, Li-7, which has 4 neutrons. Wait, Li-6 has 3 neutrons. So, perhaps the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.014 u.

Wait, let me get this right. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0141022 u. So, m = 6.0141022 u.

So, to compute m c², I need to convert u to GeV/c².

1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c², which is 0.9315 GeV/c².

So, m c² = 6.0141022 u * 0.9315 GeV/u ≈ ?

Let me compute 6 *0.9315 =5.589 GeV.

0.0141022 *0.9315 ≈ 0.01316 GeV.

So total m c² ≈5.589 +0.01316 =5.60216 GeV.

So now, E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.60216 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.57142857 *5.60216.

So, 3 *5.60216 =16.80648.

0.57142857 *5.60216.

Hmm, 0.5 is 2.80108.

0.07142857 is approximately 1/14. So 5.60216 /14 ≈0.400154.

So, 0.57142857 *5.60216 ≈ (0.5 *5.60216) + (0.07142857 *5.60216) =2.80108 + 0.400154 ≈3.201234.

So, 16.80648 +3.201234 ≈20.0077 GeV.

So approximately 20.0077 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) 20.132 GeV, and D) is 21.419 GeV.

Wait, but my calculation gives about 20.0077 GeV. The option C is 20.132, which is about 0.124 GeV higher. Hmm. So perhaps I should do a more precise calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate gamma more precisely.

Wait, let me re-calculate gamma.

v =0.96c.

v^2 = (0.96)^2 c^2 =0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28, so gamma is exactly 1/0.28 =3.5714285714...

But perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.96^2 is 0.9216, but wait, perhaps it's better to compute 1 - (0.96)^2 exactly.

Let me double-check: 0.96 times 0.96. 0.96 *0.96 = (1 -0.04)^2 =1 -0.08 + 0.0016=0.9216. So yes, correct.

Then 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly because 0.28*0.28=0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 3.5714285714.

So, m c² is 6.0141022 u *931.5 MeV/u.

Wait, let me compute m c^2 more accurately.

6.0141022 u *931.5 MeV/u = ?

6 *931.5 =5,589 MeV.

0.0141022 *931.5 = ?

0.01 *931.5 =9.315

0.0041022 *931.5 = let's compute 0.004 *931.5 =3.726.

0.0001022 *931.5 =approx 0.095.

So 3.726 +0.095=3.821.

So 0.0141022 *931.5 ≈9.315 +3.821 =13.136 MeV.

So total m c² =5,589 +13.136 =5,602.136 MeV =5.602136 GeV.

So, E = gamma * m c² =3.5714285714 *5.602136 GeV.

Let me compute that with more precision.

3.5714285714 *5.602136.

Let me break it down:

3 *5.602136 =16.806408.

0.5714285714 *5.602136.

Wait, 0.5714285714 is 4/7, so 5.602136 *4/7.

(5.602136 *4) =22.408544.

Divide by 7: 22.408544 /7 =3.2012205714.

So E =16.806408 +3.2012205714 =20.00762857 GeV.

So approximately 20.0076 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

So, 20.0076 is closest to option C (20.132 GeV) but it's a little lower. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should compute using precise methods.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Because sometimes in these problems, the energy given is the kinetic energy (KE), and the total energy is KE + m c².

Wait, the problem says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So, the energy in colliders is usually the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, let's think. In colliders, the energy is typically given as the kinetic energy per particle. Or is it the total energy? Hmm, I think in high-energy physics, the energy given is the kinetic energy. But I'm not entirely certain. Let me recall: when they say the collider operates at a certain energy, it's usually the kinetic energy, unless stated otherwise.

Wait, no, in some contexts, the rest mass plus kinetic is the total energy. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think about this.

If the question is asking for the energy of RHIC, which is the collider, it's probably the total energy (gamma*m c²). Because RHIC accelerates ions to high energies, and when they say the speed is 0.96c, it's about the kinetic energy. Or is it about the total energy?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the kinetic energy. So, let's think about kinetic energy.

The kinetic energy (K) is (gamma -1) * m c².

So, K = (gamma -1) * m c².

So, let's compute that.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

Gamma minus 1 is 2.57142857.

Multiply by m c² of 5.602136 GeV.

So, K =2.57142857 *5.602136 GeV.

Compute that.

2 *5.602136 =11.204272.

0.57142857 *5.602136 ≈3.20122057 GeV.

Total K =11.204272 +3.20122057 ≈14.40549 GeV.

But the options are all above 18 GeV, so this can't be. So perhaps the question is asking for the total energy, not the kinetic.

But wait, the figure I got for the total energy is about 20 GeV, which is option C (20.132 GeV), but my calculation is 20.0076 GeV. Hmm, perhaps I should be more precise.

Wait, let me recalculate with more precision.

Compute gamma:

v =0.96c.

gamma =1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28 =3.571428571428571.

m c^2 =6.0141022 *931.5 MeV.

Wait, 6.0141022 *931.5 = ?

Let me compute 6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.0141022 *931.5 = approx 13.136 MeV as before.

So, m c² =5602.136 MeV =5.602136 GeV.

So gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.602136 GeV.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.602136.

Compute 3 *5.602136 =16.806408.

0.57142857 *5.602136: let me compute 5.602136 *0.57142857.

Compute 5.602136 *0.5 =2.801068.

5.602136 *0.07142857.

0.07142857 is 1/14, so 5.602136 /14 = approx 0.40015257.

So 0.57142857 *5.602136 =2.801068 +0.40015257 ≈3.20122057.

So, total E=16.806408 +3.20122057 =20.00762857 GeV.

So, approximately 20.0076 GeV.

The options are:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

So, the closest is C)20.132 GeV, but my calculation is a bit lower, 20.0076. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value without approximations for gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise values.

Wait, 0.96 squared is 0.9216.

1 -0.9216=0.0784.

But perhaps I should compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately.

Wait, 0.0784 is 784/10000.

sqrt(784)=28, sqrt(10000)=100, so sqrt(784/10000)=28/100=0.28.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.5714285714...

So, precise calculation gives E=20.0076 GeV.

But none of the options exactly match that. Hmm. Let me check the options again.

Option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.124 GeV higher than our calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of Li-6.

Wait, the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.0141022 u. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact gamma.

gamma = 3.5714285714.

m c²=5.602136 GeV.

So, 3.5714285714 *5.602136 = ?

Let me compute 5.602136 *3.5714285714.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it as 5.602136 * (25/7) =5.602136 *3 +5.602136*(4/7).

Wait, 25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

So, 3 *5.602136 =16.806408.

4/7 *5.602136 = (5.602136 *4)/7.

5.602136 *4=22.408544. Divide by7: 22.408544 /7 =3.2012205714.

So, 16.806408 +3.2012205714=20.00762857 GeV.

So, 20.0076 GeV.

But the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Wait, option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to use a different value for the mass, maybe 6 u exactly, leading to 5.589 GeV for m c².

So, let's recalculate using m c²=5.589 GeV.

E =3.57142857 *5.589 GeV.

3 *5.589=16.767.

0.57142857 *5.589.

Compute 5.589 * 0.5=2.7945.

5.589 *0.07142857=approx 0.399.

So, 2.7945 +0.399=3.1935.

Total E=16.767 +3.1935=20. (approx 19.9605 GeV).

So, E=approx 19.96 GeV.

But the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps the mistake is mine. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact expression for gamma.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) =1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So, the calculation is correct. So, why is the option C 20.132?

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption about the mass is wrong. Maybe the question considered the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the individual protons and neutrons without considering binding energy. Wait, but for Li-6, the nucleons are 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So, each neutron and proton has a mass of approximately 1.007276 u (proton) and 1.008665 u (neutron). So perhaps the correct mass is (3 *1.007276 +3 *1.008665) u.

Wait, let me compute that.

3 protons:3 *1.007276 =3.021828 u.

3 neutrons:3 *1.008665=3.025995 u.

Total =3.021828 +3.025995=6.047823 u.

So, m=6.047823 u.

Wait, but that's the sum of individual nucleon masses, but the actual nucleus mass is less due to binding energy. So, perhaps the question is using that, but wait, no, the actual mass of Li-6 is about 6.014 u, which is less than 6.0478 u. So, that would give a lower mass.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the sum of individual nucleon masses, so m=6.047823 u.

So, m c²=6.047823 u *931.5 MeV/u.

Compute that:

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.047823 *931.5 =approx 44.8 MeV.

So, 5589 +44.8=5633.8 MeV=5.6338 GeV.

So, E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.6338 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.6338.

3 *5.6338=16.9014.

0.57142857 *5.6338.

Compute 5.6338 *0.5=2.8169.

5.6338 *0.07142857= approx 5.6338 * 0.07=0.394366, plus 5.6338 *0.00142857= approx 0.008046. So total approx 0.394366+0.008046=0.402412.

So, 2.8169 +0.402412=3.219312.

So, total E=16.9014 +3.219312=20.1207 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.1207 GeV. Closest to option C, which is 20.132 GeV.

But earlier, when using the correct nuclear mass (6.014 u), the E was about 20.0076 GeV.

So, now I'm confused. Why is there a discrepancy?

The issue is whether to use the exact nuclear mass (which is less than the sum of individual nucleons) or the sum. The correct approach is to use the exact mass, but perhaps in some cases, especially in educational problems, the sum is used as an approximation, leading to a higher value.

Given that the calculated E is approximately 20.0076 GeV when using the correct nuclear mass, but the option C is 20.132 GeV, perhaps the question expects us to use the sum of individual nucleon masses, which leads to a higher energy calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in using the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let me think again.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So, its mass is approximately 6.014 u, as I thought earlier.

So, perhaps the correct energy is approximately 20.0076 GeV, which is close to 20 GeV, but the options don't have this. The option C is 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the calculation.

Let me calculate gamma again.

v =0.96c.

gamma =1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

But perhaps I should compute the square root more accurately.

Wait, 0.0784. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) precisely.

0.28^2 =0.0784 exactly, so sqrt is 0.28. So, no error there.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering relativistic energy as KE, not total energy. Let me check.

Total energy E = gamma m c².

Kinetic energy K = (gamma -1) m c².

If the question is about kinetic energy, then K = (3.57142857-1)*5.602136 GeV =2.57142857 *5.602136≈14.405 GeV. But the options are higher than that, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the rest mass of Lithium ion as the atomic mass, not the nucleus. Wait, no, the nucleus is what's being accelerated, so it's the mass of the nucleus.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is considering the nucleus charge state. But in this case, since it's just the nucleus, charge state +3? Or maybe the charge is irrelevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is being taken as the atomic mass, which includes electrons. But for heavy ions, the electrons' mass is negligible, so perhaps it's not a factor.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider if the nucleus is moving at 0.96c, the total energy is gamma * m c², which is approximately 20 GeV, and the option closest is C)20.132. But my calculation with accurate mass is 20.0076 GeV, which is 0.024 GeV less than option C.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value using more precise values.

Let me compute m c² again.

The exact mass of Li-6 is 6.0141022 u.

1 u =931.494064 MeV/c².

So, m c² =6.0141022 *931.494064 MeV.

Calculate that.

6 *931.494064 =5588.964384 MeV.

0.0141022 *931.494064 = let's compute this.

0.01 *931.494064 =9.31494064 MeV.

0.0041022 *931.494064 = ?

Compute 0.004 *931.494064 =3.725976256 MeV.

0.0001022 *931.494064 = approx 0.095095 MeV.

So total for 0.0041022: 3.725976256 +0.095095 ≈3.821071 MeV.

So, 0.0141022 *931.494064 ≈9.31494064 +3.821071=13.13601164 MeV.

So, m c²=5588.964384 +13.13601164=5602.1003956 MeV=5.6021003956 GeV.

So, m c² ≈5.6021004 GeV.

Now, compute E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.6021004 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.6021004.

Let me compute 5.6021004 *3.57142857.

Let me do it step by step.

3.57142857 is 25/7.

So, 5.6021004 *25/7.

Compute 5.6021004 *25 =140.05251.

Divide by7: 140.05251 /7 =20.00750143 GeV.

So, E≈20.0075 GeV.

So, the exact value is approximately 20.0075 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV, but that's 0.1245 GeV higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in using the wrong mass. Let me double-check.

Wait, the question says that X is Lithium with 3 neutrons. So, it's Li-6. So, mass is 6.0141022 u.

Ok, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the kinetic energy. Let me compute KE.

KE = (gamma -1) * m c².

Gamma =3.57142857.

Gamma -1=2.57142857.

So, KE =2.57142857 *5.6021004 GeV.

Compute that.

2 *5.6021004=11.2042008.

0.57142857*5.6021004=3.2012205 GeV.

Total KE=11.2042008 +3.2012205=14.4054213 GeV.

But the options are much higher than that, so this can't be the case.

So, I think the problem is about the total energy, and the correct answer is approximately 20.0075 GeV, which isn't exactly any of the options. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

But none of the options are exactly 20.0075. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of gamma. Let me recompute gamma.

v =0.96c.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So, that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the speed, like 0.98c or another value. No, the question states 0.96c.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be expressed with more decimal places, but the options have four decimal places.

Let me compute 20.0075 GeV to 4 decimal places: 20.0075 GeV is 20.0075, but the option C is 20.132, which is much higher.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

Wait, 3.57142857 multiplied by5.6021004.

Let me compute it more accurately.

3.57142857 *5.6021004.

Break it down:

3 *5.6021004 =16.8063012.

0.57142857 *5.6021004.

Let me compute 0.57142857 *5.6021004.

5.6021004 *0.5 =2.8010502.

5.6021004 *0.07142857.

Compute 5.6021004 *0.07 =0.392147028.

5.6021004 *0.00142857= approx.

0.00142857 *5.6021004= approx 0.0080391.

So, 0.392147028 +0.0080391=0.400186128.

So, 5.6021004 *0.07142857≈0.400186.

So, 0.57142857 *5.6021004≈2.8010502+0.400186=3.2012362.

So, total E=16.8063012 +3.2012362=20.0075374 GeV.

So approximately 20.0075 GeV.

Hmm. So, even with more precise calculation, it's about 20.0075 GeV.

But the options don't have this. The only options in the vicinity are C)20.132 and D)21.419.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic work-energy theorem, which says that the work done on the particle equals its kinetic energy.

But I think that doesn't change the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the mass not in u but in another unit.

Wait, let me think: 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c². Did I use the right value?

Yes, I used 931.5 MeV/u.

Another possibility: perhaps the calculation should use the exact value of 931.494 MeV/u.

Let me recompute m c² with 931.494 MeV/u.

6.0141022 u *931.494 MeV/u = ?

6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.0141022 *931.494 = let me compute 0.01*931.494=9.31494 MeV.

0.0041022 *931.494=3.82107 MeV.

So, 9.31494 +3.82107=13.13601 MeV.

Total m c²=5588.964 +13.13601=5602.10001 MeV=5.60210001 GeV.

So, same as before.

Thus, I think the correct answer is approximately 20.0075 GeV. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but given the options, the closest is C)20.132 GeV.

But wait, perhaps the problem had a typo, and v is 0.98c instead of 0.96c. Let me check what gamma would be for v=0.98c.

Gamma for v=0.98c:

v² =0.98^2=0.9604.

1 - v²=0.0396.

sqrt(0.0396)=0.199.

Gamma=1/0.199≈5.0251.

E=5.0251 *5.6021≈28.15 GeV. Not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps v=0.99c.

Gamma=1/sqrt(1-0.99^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.9801)=1/sqrt(0.0199)=approx 7.101.

E=7.101 *5.6021≈39.78 GeV. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps v=0.8c.

Gamma=1/sqrt(1-0.64)=1/sqrt(0.36)=1/0.6=1.6667.

E=1.6667 *5.6021≈9.336 GeV. Not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is 0.96 times c, but in terms of beta (β), which is v/c=0.96.

Wait, did I use the correct gamma?

Yes, I think so.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the relativistic momentum formula, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is given per nucleon, but that doesn't make sense because the question is about the nucleus.

Wait, no, the problem is about the nucleus as a whole.

I'm stuck. Based on the calculation, the correct energy is approximately 20.0075 GeV, which is closest to option C)20.132 GeV. But perhaps the calculation expects to round to four decimal places, and the exact value is 20.0075, but the option is 20.132, which is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be in units where the mass is taken as 6 u, leading to E=3.5714 *5.589= approx 19.96 GeV, which is about 20 GeV, but none of the options exactly match.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.5714 *5.6021 with more exactness.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.6021004.

3.57142857 *5.6021004.

I can compute it as:

5.6021004 *3 = 16.8063012.

5.6021004 *0.57142857.

Compute 5.6021004 *0.5=2.8010502.

5.6021004 *0.07142857=0.400186128.

Total=2.8010502 +0.400186128=3.201236328.

Adding to 16.8063012: 16.8063012 +3.201236328=20.007537528 GeV.

So, E≈20.0075 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but the precise calculation is about 20.0075, which is 20.0075.

But none of the options match. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D)21.419 GeV. That would require a different gamma. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma.

Wait, 0.96^2=0.9216.

Wait, 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon instead of the nucleus. Let me think.

No, the question is about the nucleus X, so the energy is for the entire nucleus.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses an approximate value for gamma, like 3.55 instead of 3.5714.

3.55 *5.6021=approx 19.887 GeV.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, like relativistic momentum.

But the question is about energy, so I think that's not relevant.

Hmm.

Well, given that my calculation seems correct, but the options don't have this value, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, considering some rounding or a different approximation in the problem setup.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we calculate the total energy of the nucleus, which is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The speed of the nucleus is \( v = 0.96c \). Substituting into the formula for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Rest Mass Energy of the Li-6 Nucleus
The mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately \( 6.014 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Converting to GeV:

\[
m c^2 = 6.014 \, \text{u} \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV/u} = 5602.136 \, \text{MeV} = 5.602136 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Total Energy of the Nucleus
The total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.602136 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:

\[
3 \times 5.602136 = 16.806408 \, \text{GeV}
\]
\[
0.5714 \times 5.602136 \approx 3.201221 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Adding these together:

\[
E = 16.806408 + 3.201221 \approx 20.0076 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with Options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.0076 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:

- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Higher than the calculated value.

### Conclusion
The closest option to the calculated energy is **C) 20.132 GeV**. While the exact calculation gives \( 20.0076 \, \text{GeV} \), minor approximations or rounding in the problem setup may account for the slight discrepancy.
