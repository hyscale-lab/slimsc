Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with something called A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction uses 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (with water) to make 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A to D, each giving possible A and B reagents.

Hmm, I remember that nitriles can be formed from ketones. Oh wait, the first reaction is adding NaCN to a ketone. I think that's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, ketones usually react with things like NaCN under certain conditions.

Wait, but I also recall that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide source, like NaCN, it's typically in a basic medium, using something like aq. NaOH. Oh, right! It's the Stephen reduction or maybe the formation of cyanohydrin. Oh wait, cyanohydrin formation. Yeah, that's when a ketone reacts with CN- to form a cyanohydrin, which is a beta-hydroxy nitrile.

So, the reaction R2C=O + CN- → R2C(OH)CN. That's right. But to form the cyanohydrin, I think you need an acid catalyst. Because the mechanism involves the protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, so the CN- can attack. So, the reaction probably uses an acid as a catalyst. So in the first reaction, A should be an acid.

Looking at the products, the first product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see the structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN in presence of acid (like H3O+), it should add the CN group. So the product would have the structure (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Yes, that's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that makes sense.

So for reagent A, it's an acid. Looking at the options, options A and B suggest A is H3O+, while C and D suggest A is NaHSO3. Wait, what's NaHSO3? That's sodium bisulfite, which is a source of HSO3^- ions. I think HSO3^- is a weaker acid than H3O+, which is just H+ (from H3O+). So, if the reaction requires an acid catalyst, then H3O+ would be the right choice.

So for the first part, A is H3O+, which is in options A and B.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile is treated with B (in H2O) to form the corresponding acid — 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, so the nitrile group (CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH). How do you convert nitriles to carboxylic acids? I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. Typically, under strong acidic conditions, or with H2O and acid, it might form the amide or acid.

Wait, let's think. The hydrolysis of nitriles can go through different pathways. One common method is hydrolysis with H2O using HCl (acidic conditions) to form the carboxylic acid. Alternatively, in basic conditions with NaOH, you might get a sodium salt, which can then be acidified.

Alternatively, another method for nitrile hydrolysis is using a strong acid, like HCl, with water and heat, or perhaps using a peracid, but I'm not sure.

So in this case, the starting material is a nitrile (CN group) and it's converting into a carboxylic acid. So the reagent B is probably something that provides H+ and Cl- in H2O, like HCl. Or maybe another acid, like acetic acid (CH3COOH), which is option B's B reagent.

Wait, but let me think again. If you have the cyanohydrin, which is a secondary alcohol next to a nitrile group. But in this case, the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, so the structure is CH2CH2-C(OH)-CN, but wait, maybe more accurately: the structure is (Ph group attached at the 2nd carbon, but I don't think that affects the hydrolysis part).

So the nitrile group is at the beta position relative to the hydroxyl. Wait, no, in the starting material, it's 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure is:

The carbon chain is four carbons long, but the second carbon has a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group, and a benzylphenyl group attached. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(Ph)(OH)-CN? Wait no, butanenitrile would be four carbons in length. Let me count: butane is four carbons, with the nitrile at the end. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. But the compound is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, so the nitrile is at C-4, and the hydroxyl and methyl are on C-2.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me structure it. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Reacting with NaCN and acid would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So butanenitrile is four carbons, the nitrile is at the end (C4), and the hydroxyl is on C2, along with a methyl group.

So in the second reaction, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Let me imagine the structure. The nitrile is at the end (C4), and C2 has a hydroxyl, a methyl group, and a 4-benzylphenyl group. So the structure is more complicated, but the key is the nitrile group.

Now, the reaction is converting the nitrile into a carboxylic acid. So how is that done? One common method is hydrolysis under acidic conditions. For example, using H2O and HCl (like H3O+), which would protonate the nitrile, then undergo hydrolysis.

Wait, another possibility is using a strong oxidizing agent. But in this case, I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, the reaction could be using a sulfonic acid or something else, but more likely, it's an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.

Wait, but wait, I thought nitriles are hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under strong acidic conditions. For example, using concentrated HCl and water, and heat. Or perhaps under basic conditions first, then acidified.

So for the second reaction, reagent B is in H2O. So it's aqueous conditions. So B is the reagent added with water.

Looking at the options, B can be HCl or CH3COOH (acetic acid). So which one would facilitate the conversion of nitrile to carboxylic acid?

HCl is a strong acid, so probably provides H+ ions. Acetic acid is a weak acid. For the hydrolysis reaction, maybe you need a strong acid. Because nitrile hydrolysis to acid is typically done with HCl in H2O, perhaps under reflux.

Wait, but wait another thing: sometimes, in the presence of aqueous acid, the nitrile can undergo hydrolysis. Alternatively, perhaps using a peracid, but that would be for epoxidation or other things.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an oxidation. Wait, but nitriles are usually oxidized to amides or acids. For oxidation, sometimes KMnO4 or other strong oxidizing agents are used, but under specific conditions.

Wait, but in the presence of H2O and acid, maybe the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. So perhaps HCl is the reagent B.

Looking at the options, the only options with HCl as B are option A and option C. But wait, option A has B as HCl, and option C has B as HCl.

Wait, no, let me check the options again:

Options:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So, if B is HCl, that's in options A and C.

But wait, in the first reaction, if A is H3O+, then the correct options are A and B for the first part. Let me recap: for the first reaction, A must be an acid, so H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, earlier I thought that NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a weaker acid than H3O+. So when the first reaction requires an acid, H3O+ would be better.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+, which is options A and B.

But then for the second reaction, B is either HCl (A and C) or acetic acid (B and D). But if the second reaction requires HCl as the reagent, then option A would have A as H3O+ and B as HCl.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again about the second reaction.

The starting material is a nitrile, and it's being converted to a carboxylic acid. So I think the process is hydrolysis of nitrile to acid. How is that done?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to amides under certain conditions, and then further hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids. Alternatively, using a strong acid in H2O.

Wait, another approach: the second reaction involves a nitrile group undergoing hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. The reagents for this could be H2O and a strong acid, like HCl. So B would be HCl.

So if B is HCl, then looking back, in the options, the only ones with B as HCl are A and C.

But option C has A as NaHSO3, but I thought the first reaction needed H3O+ as A. So that would eliminate option C, leaving option A as a possibility.

But wait, let me think about the first reaction again. If A is NaHSO3, would that work?

Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. I know that in the case of aldehydes and ketones, adding NaHSO3 is used for the formation of bisulfite adducts, but I'm not sure if it's used for cyanohydrin formation.

Wait, the cyanohydrin reaction is typically done with NaCN in an aqueous solution, and an acid catalyst. So what's the role of the acid? It protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, so that the CN- can attack.

So if in the first reaction, A is H3O+ (which is option A and B), that would make sense. So for the first part, the correct A is H3O+.

So the second reagent (B) must be HCl, because that's the reagent for the hydrolysis.

So looking at the options, the only one that has A as H3O+ and B as HCl is option A.

Wait, but option A is A = H3O+ and B = HCl. That seems correct.

Wait, but what about option C? It has A as NaHSO3 and B as HCl. Would that work? If NaHSO3 is used as the catalyst in the first reaction, but I don't think that's correct. Because I thought the first step requires an acid like H3O+.

So putting it all together: for the first reaction, A is H3O+, and for the second reaction, B is HCl. So the correct option is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN, while the second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.

### Analysis of the First Reaction:
The reaction between butan-2-one and NaCN produces 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is a cyanohydrin. This reaction typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic for the nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, **H₃O⁺** (a strong acid) is the most suitable catalyst for this reaction. Sodium bisulfite (NaHSO₃) is not commonly used for cyanohydrin formation, as it is a weaker acid and not typically employed in this context.

### Analysis of the Second Reaction:
The second reaction converts 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile into 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid, which involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. This process is typically carried out under acidic conditions, often using HCl in water. While acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is also an acid, it is a weaker acid compared to HCl, and HCl is more commonly used for such hydrolytic reactions.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  This combination is suitable for both reactions. H₃O⁺ is the correct catalyst for cyanohydrin formation, and HCl is appropriate for nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.

- **Option B:** A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH is not strong enough for efficient nitrile hydrolysis in the second reaction.

- **Option C:** A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, as it is not commonly used for cyanohydrin formation. Although HCl is correct for the second reaction, this option is invalid due to the incorrect choice of A.

- **Option D:** A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  Both reagents are incorrect for their respective reactions. NaHSO₃ is unsuitable for the first reaction, and CH₃COOH is not strong enough for the second reaction.

### Conclusion:
The correct combination of reagents is **A = H₃O⁺** and **B = HCl**, which corresponds to **Option A**.
