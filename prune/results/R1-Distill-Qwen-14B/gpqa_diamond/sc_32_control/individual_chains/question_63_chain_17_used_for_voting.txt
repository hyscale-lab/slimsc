Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

The problem says we have a diatomic molecule with elements X and Y. The model used is the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state. The given data includes the masses of X and Y (20 amu and 2 amu), the bond length R (2 angstroms), and the angular frequency w (4e14 rad/s). The options are four possible momenta.

Wait, so what's the fundamental state in this context? Oh, right, the fundamental state is the state with the lowest possible energy. In the rotation-vibration model, each state is characterized by vibrational and rotational quantum numbers. For the fundamental state, I think that refers to the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0) as well. So the molecule is in the state (v=0, J=0).

But wait, when they say "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy," I think that means the next state after the fundamental. So we need to figure out what the next state is. In quantum mechanics, states are ordered by their energy levels. The energy levels for a diatomic molecule in the rotation-vibration model include both vibrational and rotational contributions.

The energy levels for vibration are quantized as Ev = (v + 1/2) h w. For rotation, the energy is Er = (J (J+1) h²)/(8 I), where I is the moment of inertia. The total energy is Ev + Er.

The fundamental state is v=0 and J=0, so Ev = (0 + 1/2) h w = (1/2) h w, and Er = 0. So the total energy is (1/2) h w.

The next state would have the lowest possible higher energy. That's either increasing v by 1 (v=1, J=0) or increasing J by 1 (v=0, J=1), whichever has a lower energy. We need to compute both possibilities and see which one is lower so that the molecule can transition to the next state.

Wait, but in some cases, it's the combination of both, but maybe in the case of the next state, it's the next in order. Let me think. The order of energy levels for diatomic molecules is such that the rotational levels within a vibrational state can have varying energies. So, the first excited state after the fundamental could be either the first vibrational state or the first rotational state, depending on which has lower energy.

So, the energy for the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0) would be Ev = (1 + 1/2) h w = (3/2) h w. The rotational energy for J=1 is Er = [1(1+1) h²]/(8 I) = (2 h²)/(8 I) = h²/(4 I). So, to find which has lower energy, we need to compare (3/2) h w and h²/(4 I).

Wait, but the question is about a photon being absorbed. The photon's energy must match the energy difference between the initial and final states. So the photon's energy E_photon = E_final - E_initial.

If the molecule is in (v=0, J=0), and the next state is (v=0, J=1), then E_photon = Er(J=1) - Er(J=0) = [h²/(4 I)] - 0 = h²/(4 I).

Alternatively, if the next state is (v=1, J=0), then E_photon is Ev(v=1) - Ev(v=0) = (3/2 h w) - (1/2 h w) )= h w.

But which of these two energies is smaller? So we need to calculate both and see which is smaller because the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon must have the energy corresponding to the lowest possible energy jump.

Alternatively, perhaps the next state is the one with the next higher energy, regardless of whether it's rotational or vibrational. So the energy difference between (v=0, J=0) and (v=0, J=1) is Er = h²/(4 I). The energy difference between (v=0, J=0) and (v=1, J=0) is h w. So which is lower?

Wait, let's compute both values.

First, let's compute I, the moment of inertia. I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass. μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

Calculating μ:

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = approximately 1.818 amu.

Wait, but for calculations, 1 amu is about 1.66e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 amu * 1.66e-27 kg/amu ≈ 1.818 * 1.66e-27 ≈ approximately 3.01e-27 kg.

Wait, 1.818 * 1.66 is about 3.01, yes.

So I = μ R². R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

I = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.204e-46 kg m².

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute that again. 2e-10 squared is 4e-20. 3.01e-27 multiplied by 4e-20 is 1.204e-46 kg m².

Now, compute the rotational energy difference for J=1:

ΔE_rot = [ (J+1)(J+2) - J (J+1) ] * (h²/(8 I)) when J increases by 1. Wait, no, since we're going from J=0 to J=1. So the energy for J=1 is (1*2) * h²/(8 I) = 2 h²/(8 I) = h²/(4 I). For J=0, energy is 0, so the difference is h²/(4 I).

So ΔE_rot = h²/(4 I).

Compute that.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J s.

So h² is (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J² s².

So h²/(4 I) = (4.39e-67) / (4 * 1.204e-46) ).

Compute denominator: 4 * 1.204e-46 = 4.816e-46.

So 4.39e-67 / 4.816e-46 ≈ (4.39 /4.816 ) * 1e-21 ≈ 0.912 * 1e-21 ≈ 9.12e-22 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference is h w.

Given w is 4e14 rad/s.

h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So which is smaller? 9.12e-22 J (rotational) vs. 2.65e-19 J (vibrational). Clearly, the rotational energy difference is much smaller.

Wait, wait—that can't be right. Vibrational energy levels are usually higher than rotational, but maybe the numbers change. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the denominator. Let me recompute I.

Wait, I = μ R². μ is (20 * 2)/(22) amu = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

1 amu is 1.66e-27 kg, so μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ approximately 3.01e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. R² is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I = 3.01e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.204e-46 kg m².

Now, h is 6.626e-34 J s.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approximately 4.39e-67 J² s².

So h²/(4 I) = (4.39e-67) / (4 * 1.204e-46) ) = 4.39e-67 / (4.816e-46) = approximately (4.39 /4.816) * 1e-21 = approx 0.912e-21 = 9.12e-22 J.

h w is 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So 9.12e-22 J is much smaller than 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational transition.

Wait, but in the question, the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0). So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can go to either v=1 (vibrational excitation) or J=1 (rotational excitation). But the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one with the smallest possible energy difference. So the rotational transition would be lower energy.

Thus, the photon's energy must match the rotational energy difference, i.e., ΔE = h²/(4 I).

But wait, the question is about momentum. The photon's energy is related to its momentum. So E_photon = p c, where c is the speed of light. Or wait, the energy of a photon is E = pc, since for photons, E = pc because their mass is zero. So p = E / c.

Wait, correct. The energy of a photon is E = h f = p c, where f is the frequency, and p is the momentum.

So, the question is, after the molecule absorbs a photon, it goes to the next state. The photon's energy needs to match the energy difference between these states.

So, the photon's energy is E_photon = ΔE_rot = 9.12e-22 J.

Then, p = E / c = 9.12e-22 J / (3e8 m/s) = approximately 3.04e-30 kg m/s.

Wait, but wait, none of the options are that small. The options are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let me retrace my steps.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the model. The problem states it's the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor model). Oh wait, but the non-rigid rotor model is another way of saying the same thing as the rigid rotor, but maybe the treatment is different? Or perhaps the question is considering the molecule in a vibrationally excited state, but the initial state is (v=0, J=0), and the next state is (v=0, J=1), requiring a photon of energy h²/(4 I), as before.

Wait, but perhaps the molecule is in the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator approximation. So the energy levels are given by Ev = (v + 1/2) h w and Er = [J (J+1) h² ]/(8 I).

So the initial state is (v=0, J=0), and the next state would be the one with the lowest higher energy. So which is lower: going to (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0)?

We calculated that the energy difference for (v=0, J=1) is about 9.12e-22 J, and for (v=1, J=0) is about 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition has a lower energy. So the photon must have this lower energy, 9.12e-22 J.

Wait, but when I compute the momentum from this energy, p = E_photon / c.

E_photon = 9.12e-22 J.

c = 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.12e-22 / 3e8 = 3.04e-30 kg m/s.

But none of the options are that small. The options are A) 1.9e-28, B) 2.3e-27, C)1.1e-27, D)1.4e-28.

Hmm, my current calculation is way off. So perhaps I messed up some constants or made a miscalculation.

Wait a second, maybe I forgot that the reduced mass is in terms of kg. Let me recheck the μ calculation.

Wait, μ is (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) = 40/(22) amu = about 1.818 amu, which is correct.

But 1.818 amu in kg: 1 amu is 1.66053906660e-27 kg, so 1.818 * 1.66e-27 is approximately 3.01e-27 kg. So that part is correct.

R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters; correct.

I = μ R^2 = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m². That's correct.

h is 6.626e-34 J s.

So h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67.

h²/(4 I) = (4.39e-67) / (4 * 1.204e-46) ) = 4.39e-67 / 4.816e-46 = approx 9.12e-22 J. That seems correct.

So the photon's energy is 9.12e-22 J. Then p = E/c = 9.12e-22 / 3e8 = 3.04e-30 kg m/s. Hmm, but none of the options are near that. So perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the photon's energy as the sum of both rotational and vibrational differences? No, because the next state would be either a higher J or a higher v, whichever has the lower energy. Since the rotational step is lower, the photon should match that.

Alternatively, maybe I've confused the energy levels. Let me think again. The energy levels for rotation are much closer together than the vibrational levels. So the rotational energy levels are more densely spaced.

So, in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next state is (v=0, J=1), which requires a lower energy than the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0). So the photon's energy is the rotational energy difference.

Wait, but why are none of the options matching this? Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I. Let me compute I again.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Yes, that's correct.

R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ * R^2 = 1.818 amu * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, but 1.818 amu is 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.01e-27 kg.

So I = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.204e-46 kg m². Correct.

So h²/(4 I) = (6.626e-34)^2/(4 * 1.204e-46) = (4.39e-67)/(4.816e-46) ≈ 9.12e-22 J.

But the options are much larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the next state as the next rotational state, but perhaps I've made a mistake in the energy difference.

Wait, the energy for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is given by ΔE_rot = [ (J+1)(J+2) - J (J+1) ] * h²/(8 I) ) = [ (2)(3) - (1)(2) ] * h²/(8 I) ) = (6 - 2) h²/(8 I) ) = 4 h²/(8 I) = h²/(2 I).

Wait, wait a second! I think I made a mistake earlier. The rotational energy for J is (J (J+1) h²)/(8 I). So when going from J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is:

E(1) - E(0) = [1 * 2 h²/(8 I)] - 0 = 2 h²/(8 I) = h²/(4 I).

Which is what I had before. So that part was correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should be considering the photon's energy as the sum of both the rotational and vibrational contributions, but that doesn't make sense because the transition would only change either v or J, not both.

Wait, unless the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), and the next state is (v=0, J=1), which would only require a rotational transition.

So, the photon's energy is 9.12e-22 J, which gives p =3.04e-30 kg m/s. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the model.

Wait, perhaps the question is about a photon causing a transition from the ground vibrational state to the next vibrational state, regardless of rotation. Because in the rotation-vibration model, sometimes the next state is the first vibrational state, regardless of the rotational state.

Wait, but in that case, the energy would be higher than the rotational transition, so the photon would have to have higher energy. But the question asks for the minimal possible energy, so it's more likely to be the rotational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator, and the total energy is the sum. So the next state could be the combination of v=0, J=1. So the energy is just the rotational part.

Wait, but perhaps the initial state is (v=0, J=0), and the next state is (v=0, J=1), which requires a photon of energy h²/(4 I) as calculated.

But why are the options different?

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the approximation where the rotational energy is considered with the reduced mass in terms of atomic mass units. Or perhaps I messed up the calculation of the moment of inertia.

Wait, another approach. Let me compute the reduced mass μ in kg correctly.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

1.818 amu * 1.660539e-27 kg/amu ≈ 1.818 * 1.660539e-27 ≈ approximately 3.01e-27 kg. So that part is correct.

Wait, a different approach: perhaps the photon's energy is that required to increase the rotational state, so E = h²/(4 I).

But I = μ R².

So, let's compute I again:

I = μ R².

R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

μ = 3.01e-27 kg.

I = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 *4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m².

Then, h²/(4 I) = (6.626e-34)^2 / (4 *1.204e-46) ) = (4.39e-67) / (4.816e-46) ) = 9.12e-22 J.

So, E_photon =9.12e-22 J.

p_photon = E/c =9.12e-22 /3e8 =3.04e-30 kg m/s.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I should be considering the photon's energy as the vibrational energy, which is h w. Wait, let me compute that.

h w =6.626e-34 J s *4e14 s^-1 =2.6504e-19 J.

p_photon =2.65e-19 J /3e8 m/s =8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Wait, 8.83e-28 kg m/s is approximately 8.8e-28 N s (since 1 N s = 1 kg m/s).

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is less than my calculation. Option A is 1.9e-28, which is close but higher.

Hmm, perhaps I should recompute.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of μ.

Wait, Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2) =40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

But perhaps instead of converting amu to kg, the problem expects me to use the reduced mass in terms of the atomic mass unit, but that's unlikely because the bond length is in angstroms, which is in meters.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the reduced mass. Wait, let me compute μ again.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈1.8181818... amu.

Yes.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the model is such that the next state is the first rotational state (J=1), but with the vibrational state also being considered. Wait, that's not the case. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be (v=0, J=1), so the energy is purely rotational.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo and the options are in the wrong units, but probably not. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the formula for the energy difference.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy difference is not h²/(4 I), but something else. Wait, the energy for J=0 is zero, J=1 is h²/(8 I) * 2 (since J=1, so (1)(2) =2) * (h²)/(8 I) = h²/(4 I). Correct.

Wait, so the photon's momentum is 3e-30 kg m/s, which is 3e-30 N s. But none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the photon's energy again. The energy of a photon is E = h f = p c. So p = E / c.

But wait, in this case, the energy is h²/(4 I), so p = (h²)/(4 I c).

Let me compute that.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

h squared is 4.39e-67.

I is 1.204e-46 kg m².

So h²/(4 I) = 4.39e-67/(4 *1.204e-46) = 9.12e-22 J.

Then, p = 9.12e-22 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.04e-30 kg m/s = 3.04e-30 N s.

Hmm, 3.04e-30 is 3e-30, which isn't any of the options.

So either I'm making a mistake or the options are wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the photon's energy as the sum of both vibrational and rotational energy differences, but that doesn't make sense because the molecule can only change one quantum number at a time in this model.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the fundamental vibration plus rotation state. Oh wait, no, the fundamental state is v=0, J=0.

Wait, perhaps the next state is the first allowed state, which would be J=1, but in the same vibrational state (v=0). So that's the same as what I considered earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach. Maybe the problem is considering the energy transition as the sum of rotational and vibrational, but that's not the case. The molecule can't change both v and J in a single photon transition unless the selection rules allow it, but the question says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy, so probably only a single change.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 in the formula for the rotational energy. Let me recheck.

The rotational energy for a diatomic molecule is Er = (J (J+1) h² )/(8 I). So, when J=0, Er=0. For J=1, Er= (1*2 h²)/(8 I) )= (2 h²)/(8 I) ) = h²/(4 I). Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the vibrational transition. Because in some cases, the vibrational energy is much higher than rotational. So the photon's energy would be h w, which is 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, option A is 1.9e-28, option C is 1.1e-27, and option B is 2.3e-27.

Hmm, 8.83e-28 isn't exactly an option, but it's closest to option A (1.9e-28) and D (1.4e-28). But 8.83e-28 is more than double of A and D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating h w.

Wait, w is given as 4e14 rad/s. h is 6.626e-34 J s.

h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J. Correct.

Hmm. So I'm getting conflicting results. If the photon's energy is the rotational energy, the momentum is about 3e-30, which isn't an option. If it's the vibrational energy, the momentum is about 8.8e-28, which is not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the molecule's transition in the vibration-rotation spectrum, where the photon's energy corresponds to both vibrational and rotational changes. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the problem is considering the molecule in the ground vibrational state (v=0) but with J=0, and the next state is (v=0, J=1), which requires the photon's energy to be the rotational part. So, the photon's momentum is about 3e-30 kg m/s, which is 3e-30 N s. But none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moment of inertia. Wait, let me compute I again.

I = μ R².

μ in kg: 3.01e-27 kg.

R = 2e-10 m.

So I = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 *4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m².

Wait, wait, no, (2e-10)^2 is 4e-20. So I = 3.01e-27 *4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m². Correct.

So, perhaps I should check the calculation of h²/(4 I) again.

h =6.626e-34.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67.

h²/(4 I) =4.39e-67 / (4 *1.204e-46) ) =4.39e-67 / 4.816e-46 ≈9.12e-22 J.

E_photon =9.12e-22 J.

p_photon = E_photon / c =9.12e-22 /3e8 =3.04e-30 kg m/s.

Hmm. So, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the photon's energy as the vibrational energy, which gives a momentum of about 8.8e-28 kg m/s, but that's not matching any option either.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the reduced mass in terms of (Mx My)/(Mx + My) but using different units, perhaps in atomic mass units and bond length in angstroms without converting to meters.

Wait, but that's unlikely because the formula for I requires meters.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the moment of inertia as (Mx + My) R^2 instead of the reduced mass. Let me try that.

Wait, I = (Mx + My) R^2. So Mx + My is 20 + 2=22 amu.

But 1 amu is 1.66e-27 kg, so 22 amu is 3.652e-26 kg.

R is 2e-10 m.

I = 3.652e-26 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.652e-26 *4e-20 =1.46e-45 kg m².

h²/(4 I) = (4.39e-67) / (4 *1.46e-45) ) =4.39e-67 /5.84e-45 =7.51e-23 J.

p_photon =7.51e-23 /3e8 =2.50e-31 kg m/s. That's even smaller than before.

But that approach is incorrect because the moment of inertia uses the reduced mass, not the sum.

So, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the problem is about a photon causing the molecule to transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next allowed state, which is (v=1, J=0), requiring a photon with energy h w.

Wait, but the energy would be h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p_photon =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Which is approximately 8.8e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which is about 1/6th of that.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the angular frequency given is in cm^-1, but no, the problem states it's in rad/s.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the vibrational frequency in terms of wave numbers (cm^-1), but it's given as 4e14 rad/s, which is a frequency, not a wave number. So I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the photon's momentum using the formula p = ħ k, where k is the wave number.

Wait, ħ is h/(2π). So, E = ħ ω, and p = ħ k, where k = ω/c.

So, p = ħ ω / c.

But for a photon, E = h f = p c, so p = E/c.

Wait, so perhaps the mistake is that I should calculate the momentum using p = h/(λ), where λ is the wavelength. But λ = c/f, so p = h f / c = E/c.

So, same as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B)2.3e-27 Ns

C)1.1e-27 Ns

D)1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is considering that the molecule absorbs a photon that simultaneously excites it to the next rotational and vibrational state, but that's not the next lowest state. Because the next lowest would be either rotational or vibrational, whichever is lower.

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually considering the fundamental vibrational state (v=0) but the lowest rotational state (J=0), and the next state is (v=0, J=1), which requires the rotational energy. So the photon's energy is h²/(4 I) =9.12e-22 J, which gives p=3.04e-30 Ns.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps the moment of inertia is being calculated using the reduced mass in atomic mass units multiplied by bond length in angstroms, but that would be incorrect unit-wise.

Wait, I think I've spent enough time trying different approaches, but none are matching the options. Perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the photon's momentum in terms of the vibrational energy. Let me compute that again.

p_photon = E_photon / c = (h w) / c.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p_photon =2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

Which is 8.8347e-28 N s, since 1 N s = 1 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A (1.9e-28) and option D (1.4e-28). But 8.8e-28 is about 6 times larger than option A and 6 times larger than option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the next state as the first vibrationally excited state, which would require a photon of energy h w, giving p_photon=8.8e-28, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of p_photon. Let me compute it again.

h w =6.626e-34 J s *4e14 s^-1 =2.6504e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.6504e-19 J /3e8 m/s = 8.8347e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 Ns.

So, it's approximately 8.8e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, the only option in the same ballpark is option A (1.9e-28) and option D (1.4e-28). But 8.8 is much larger than both. So perhaps the problem is considering a different model.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is in the first excited vibrational state (v=1), but that's not the fundamental state.

Wait, no, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, so v=0, J=0.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the transition to a state with J=1 and v=0, but the formula for the rotational energy uses a different expression.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the rotational energy is (J (J+1) ħ²)/(2 I), where ħ is h/(2π). So then, the energy would be (1*2 ħ²)/(2 I) )= (2 ħ²)/(2 I) = ħ²/I.

So, E_rot = ħ²/(I).

Which would change the calculation. Let me see.

I = μ R² = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 1.204e-46 kg m².

ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 6.626e-34 /6.283 ≈1.054e-33 J s.

So ħ² = (1.054e-33)^2 ≈1.111e-66 J² s².

E_rot = ħ² / I =1.111e-66 / 1.204e-46 ≈9.22e-21 J.

Then, p_photon = E_rot / c =9.22e-21 /3e8 ≈3.07e-29 kg m/s.

Still not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the next state is (v=1, J=0), requiring a photon of energy h w =2.65e-19 J, and p=8.83e-28 Ns. But again, no option matches.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is referring to the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first vibration-rotation state, which is (v=1, J=1). But that would require both a vibrational and rotational change, which might have a higher energy.

But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy, so that would still be the rotational change.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator, and the next state is the first vibrational state (v=1), regardless of J. So the photon's energy is h w, giving p=8.8e-28 Ns. But again, no matching option.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the reduced mass in atomic mass units without converting to kg, but that's not correct because the formula for I requires kg and meters.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the reduced mass. Let me recheck:

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ= (20 *2 )/(20+2) =40/22 =1.818 amu.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the moment of inertia is μ R², but R is in angstroms, not meters. Oh wait, no, because R is given in angstroms (2 angstroms), I correctly converted it to meters (2e-10 m). So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the bond length in Bohr radii or another unit, but the question states it's in angstroms, so that's correct.

At this point, I'm stuck. My calculations don't yield any of the given options, which suggests I might have misinterpreted the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects an approximate calculation, and I should match the closest option.

Wait, considering the rotational energy gives a photon momentum of ~3e-30 Ns, which isn't an option. Vibrational gives ~8.8e-28 Ns, which isn't an option either. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a different formula for the energy or a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the molecule transitioning from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the state (v=0, J=1), which requires the rotational energy. But perhaps the problem expects me to express the momentum in terms of hbar and other constants without calculating the exact numerical value.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the photon's momentum using the rotational energy difference.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula p = sqrt(2 m E), but that's for particles in a box, not photons.

No, photons don't follow that. Their momentum is E/c.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the energy difference as the sum of both rotational and vibrational contributions. But I don't think that's correct, as the molecule can only change one quantum number at a time.

Wait, perhaps the next state is (v=0, J=1, and the vibrational state is still v=0), so the photon's energy is just the rotational part, which would be 9.12e-22 J, giving p=3.04e-30 Ns.

But that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is none of the options provided, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule absorbs a photon and transitions to the next higher energy state, which could involve both vibrational and rotational changes. But that's not the case for the next lowest energy state.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the first excited state as (v=1, J=0), which would require a photon energy of h w, leading to p_photon=8.8e-28 Ns. But again, none of the options match.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the moment of inertia in different units. Let me try expressing I in terms of 10^-46 kg m².

I = 1.204e-46 kg m².

Then, h²/(4 I) = (6.626e-34)^2/(4 *1.204e-46) )= (4.39e-67)/(4.816e-46)=9.12e-22 J.

p_photon = 9.12e-22 /3e8 =3.04e-30 kg m/s =3.04e-30 Ns.

No option matches. So perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the photon's momentum based on the vibrational energy, leading to p=8.8e-28 Ns. Again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the bond length in a different way. Wait, bond length R is 2 angstroms. Did I correctly square it? Yes, (2e-10)^2=4e-20.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Given the calculations, none of the options seem to match. However, the closest option to the vibrational energy approach is option A (1.9e-28), which is about 1/5th of my calculated value. But I don't see where I might have missed a factor of 5.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h w.

Wait, let me recompute h w:

h =6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J. Correct.

p_photon =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 Ns.

Hmm. No option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the vibrational transition, but the given options suggest much smaller values. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reduced mass is calculated using Mx and My in kilograms already.

But let me compute μ again.

Mx=20 amu =20 *1.66e-27 kg=3.32e-26 kg.

My=2 amu=2 *1.66e-27=3.32e-27 kg.

μ = (3.32e-26 *3.32e-27) / (3.32e-26 +3.32e-27) ) kg.

Wait, wait, that's incorrect. μ = (Mx My)/(Mx + My).

Mx=3.32e-26 kg.

My=3.32e-27 kg.

Mx + My =3.32e-26 +3.32e-27 =3.32e-26 +0.332e-26 =3.652e-26 kg.

Mx * My =3.32e-26 *3.32e-27 = (3.32)^2 *1e-53 =10.9584 *1e-53 =1.09584e-52 kg².

So μ =1.09584e-52 /3.652e-26 = (1.09584 /3.652) *1e-26 kg.

1.09584 /3.652 ≈0.3.

So μ ≈0.3e-26 kg =3e-27 kg.

Which matches my earlier calculation of approximately 3.01e-27 kg.

Hmm. So, that's correct.

At this point, I'm stuck. I think the correct approach is to choose the option that corresponds to the rotational transition, which is 3.04e-30 Ns, but since that's not an option, perhaps the problem expects me to choose the vibrational transition, which gives 8.8e-28 Ns, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the photon's momentum. Let me recompute everything one last time.

h =6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

Which is 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking back at the options:

A)1.9e-28

B)2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28.

Hmm. 8.8e-28 is not exactly any of these, but option A is 1.9e-28, which is about a fifth of my calculation. Could I have missed a factor of 5 somewhere?

Wait, perhaps the reduced mass was miscalculated. Let me recompute μ.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 *2) / (20 +2) =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

1 amu=1.660539e-27 kg.

μ=1.818 *1.660539e-27 ≈3.01e-27 kg. Correct.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the rotational energy as (J (J+1) h² )/(8 I), but I might have missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, no, the formula is correct. The rotational energy for J=0 is zero, for J=1 is h²/(4 I), and so on.

Hmm. I think I've exhausted all possibilities and the correct calculation doesn't match any of the options. But given the options, perhaps the closest is option D) 1.4e-28 Ns, which is about a sixth of the vibrational transition's momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to use the rotational energy, but the options don't match. Without further clues, I'm unsure. But perhaps the intended answer is option A) 1.9e-28 Ns, which is approximately 1/5th of the vibrational transition's momentum. But I don't see a clear reason for this discrepancy.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the bond length in a different unit, such as picometers. No, the problem states it's in angstroms.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the moment of inertia in terms of kg m², but I did that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should present the answer based on the rotational transition, which would be around 3e-30 Ns, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is based on the vibrational transition, which gives p_photon=8.8e-28 Ns, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I. Let me compute I again.

μ =3.01e-27 kg.

R=2e-10 m.

I=μ R²=3.01e-27 *4e-20=1.204e-46 kg m².

Yes.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

h²=4.39e-67.

h²/(4 I)=4.39e-67/(4 *1.204e-46)=4.39e-67/4.816e-46=9.12e-22 J.

p_photon=9.12e-22/3e8=3.04e-30 kg m/s=3.04e-30 Ns.

No option matches.

I'm stuck. Perhaps the intended answer is option C) 1.1e-27 Ns.

Wait, how would that come about? Let me think. If I made a mistake in the calculation of I, perhaps I used R in meters instead of angstroms.

Wait, no, I did convert R to meters correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I used the wrong formula for the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference for J=1 is (J=1) minus (J=0) = (2 h²/(8 I)) -0 = h²/(4 I), which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy as the sum of both rotational and vibrational energies. So E = h w + h²/(4 I).

Then E_photon =2.65e-19 +9.12e-22 ≈2.65e-19 J.

p_photon=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 Ns.

Still no matching option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule transitions to the next allowed state in the vibration-rotation spectrum, which would be (v=1, J=0), requiring the vibrational energy, which leads to p_photon=8.8e-28 Ns. But again, no matching option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the photon's momentum as the vibrational energy divided by twice the speed of light. Then p= E/(2c) =2.65e-19/(6e8)=4.42e-28 Ns. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects only the rotational part, leading to p=3e-30 Ns, but that's not an option.

I'm at a loss. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option A) 1.9e-28 Ns, which is about 1/5th of the vibrational transition's momentum. But I have no idea why that would be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem made a mistake in the options. But without further information, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D) 1.4e-28 Ns, which is approximately 1.6e-28. Wait, 1.4e-28 is about 1/6th of the vibrational transition's momentum.

But I have no basis for this choice.

After all this, I think the intended answer is option A) 1.9e-28 Ns, based on the vibrational transition, but perhaps I missed a factor somewhere.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the momentum of a photon required to transition a diatomic molecule from its fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, and the given parameters include the masses of the atoms (Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu), the bond length (R = 2 angstroms), and the angular frequency of vibration (w = 4×10¹⁴ rad/s). The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Fundamental State and Next State**:  
   The fundamental state corresponds to (v=0, J=0). The next state with the lowest energy could either be (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0). The energy difference for these transitions must be calculated to determine which requires the lower energy.

2. **Moment of Inertia (I)**:  
   The moment of inertia is calculated using the reduced mass (μ) and the bond length (R):  
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
   \]  
   Converting to kilograms:  
   \[
   \mu = 1.818 \cdot 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.01 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
   \]  
   Using \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), the moment of inertia is:  
   \[
   I = \mu R^2 = (3.01 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.204 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2.
   \]

3. **Rotational Energy Difference**:  
   The rotational energy difference for the transition from \( J=0 \) to \( J=1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{h^2}{4I}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s} \) and \( I = 1.204 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \):  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{4 \cdot 1.204 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.12 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   The corresponding photon momentum is:  
   \[
   p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.12 \times 10^{-22}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.04 \times 10^{-30} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}.
   \]  
   This value is much smaller than any of the provided options.

4. **Vibrational Energy Difference**:  
   The vibrational energy difference for the transition from \( v=0 \) to \( v=1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \cdot w = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   The corresponding photon momentum is:  
   \[
   p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}.
   \]  
   This value is also not directly matched by any of the options.

5. **Comparison of Options**:  
   - **Option A (1.9 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s)**: Closest to the vibrational transition but about 1/5th of the calculated value.  
   - **Option B (2.3 × 10⁻²⁷ N·s)**: Too large compared to both rotational and vibrational transitions.  
   - **Option C (1.1 × 10⁻²⁷ N·s)**: Too large compared to both rotational and vibrational transitions.  
   - **Option D (1.4 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s)**: Closest to the rotational transition but about 1/22nd of the calculated value.

6. **Conclusion**:  
   The calculated momentum for the rotational transition (\( p \approx 3.04 \times 10^{-30} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)) does not match any of the options. The vibrational transition (\( p \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)) is closer to Option A but still not exact. Given the available choices, the most reasonable answer is **Option A (1.9 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s)**, which may reflect an approximation or rounding in the problem setup.

Answer: A
