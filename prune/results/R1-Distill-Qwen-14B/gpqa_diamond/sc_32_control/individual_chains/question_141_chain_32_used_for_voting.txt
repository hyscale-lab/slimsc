Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products are formed.

Hmm, wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, wait, that might be a typo. Because benzene can't have two substituents unless specified. Oh wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene? Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene? No, wait, the 'd' might be a typo. Maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene? Hmm, the question isn't clear. Alternatively, maybe the 'd' stands for something else, like a deuterium? Oh wait, maybe it's a benzene ring with two substituents: a bromine in position 1 and something else in position 2. But the 'd' is confusing.

Wait, the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Maybe that structure is actually 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene? Alternatively, perhaps the 'd' is a typo and it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene? Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the 'd' is actually a 'Cl'? No, perhaps it's a different substituent. Alternatively, maybe the structure is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, also known as 2-bromo toluene.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene. So the positions are bromine at position 1 (which is the same as position para) but wait, in benzene, position 1 and 2 are adjacent. Wait, benzene is a ring with six positions. So 1-bromo-2-methyl would have Br at position 1 and methyl at position 2 (adjacent). Alternatively, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, which would have Br at position 1, and methyl groups at 2 and 4.

But regardless, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. That sounds like a strong base, so perhaps a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction. Wait, but that's for alkanes. Or maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution? Hmm, but aromatic rings are generally not that reactive towards nucleophilic substitution unless activated.

Wait, but benzene is typically not reactive under such conditions. So maybe this is a dehydrohalogenation, but that's more for allylic or benzylic positions. Wait, bromobenzene itself doesn't have a good leaving group for elimination unless it's in a position where a base can abstract a proton that's anti to the Br, leading to a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on the benzene ring are such that when treated with a strong base like NaNH2, a benzyne intermediate is formed. Benzyne is a aryne, which is a benzene ring with a triple bond, highly strained but can undergo various reactions.

Wait, for benzyne formation, you typically have a dihalobenzene where two adjacent positions have halogens. For example, 1,2-dibromobenzene, when treated with a strong base, can lose HBr twice to form benzyne. Alternatively, something like 1-bromo-2-iodobenzene would also form benzyne upon dehalogenation.

But in the given compound, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, perhaps substituent at position 2 is another Br? So it might be 1,2-dibromobenzene. Then, treatment with a strong base like NaNH2 would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of Br- twice and forming a triple bond, creating benzyne.

Wait, but if the substituents are in positions 1 and 2, then removing H from position 1 and 2 would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are at positions 1 and 3, but that's not adjacent.

Wait, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Maybe the 'd' is a typo and it's a Cl? Like 1-bromo-2-chlorobenzene. If that's the case, then the two substituents (Br and Cl) are adjacent. Then, NaNH2 would abstract H from each, leading to elimination of Cl and Br, forming benzyne.

But I'm not sure about the 'd'. Alternatively, perhaps the 'd' refers to another substituent, but without knowing, it's hard to proceed.

Assuming it's 1,2-dibromobenzene, then upon treatment with NaNH2 in ammonia, the base would deprotonate adjacent to the Br atoms, leading to the elimination of two Br- and forming a triple bond (benzyne). Benzyne is a highly strained molecule and can undergo various reactions, such as cycloadditions or rearrangements.

Wait, but what reaction conditions are present? The solvent is condensed ammonia, which is typically used in dehydrohalogenation reactions. So, NaNH2 is a strong base, which will deprotonate the β-position relative to the Br atoms.

So if the molecule is 1,2-dibromobenzene, the base would abstract a proton from position 3 (adjacent to Br at 2?), wait, perhaps positions 1 and 2 are Br, and the H is abstracted from either position 6 (which is adjacent to 1) or position 3 (adjacent to 2). Wait, benzene structure:

Positions 1: Br
Position 2: Br
So the possible H's adjacent to Br are positions 6 (next to 1) and 3 (next to 2). So deprotonation at 6 and elimination of Br from 1, or deprotonation at 3 and elimination of Br from 2? Or perhaps both possibilities occur, leading to the formation of benzyne.

Once benzyne is formed, it can undergo various reactions. But in this case, since there's no other reagent, maybe the benzyne could rearrange or perhaps undergo some ring-opening. Alternatively, the question is about the possible byproducts or products formed from the initial reaction.

Wait, but the reaction is with NaNH2 in ammonia. So another possibility is that it's a dehydrohalogenation, but perhaps in a way that forms a triple bond, hence aryne.

So, if the starting material is 1,2-dibromobenzene, the reaction would form benzyne. But how many possible products does that lead to?

Wait, but the question is about how many possible organic products are formed. So if the starting material is 1-bromo-2-dibromobenzene (I'm not sure about the structure), perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of multiple products via different elimination paths.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material has one Br and another substituent that can undergo elimination. So perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene. Wait, but that wouldn't have another leaving group. Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, but that's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, which upon deprotonation by NaNH2, perhaps the methyl groups can't eliminate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2-chlorobenzene. So it's 1-bromo-2-chlorobenzene. Then, treatment with NaNH2 would deprotonate adjacent to either Br or Cl, leading to elimination of either Br or Cl, but since both are leaving groups, perhaps a double elimination occurs leading to benzyne.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a base, so it's more about deprotonation and elimination. So in 1-bromo-2-chlorobenzene, the base could abstract a β-hydrogen adjacent to the Br, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a double bond. Or abstract a hydrogen adjacent to Cl, leading to elimination of Cl and formation of a different double bond.

But in this case, perhaps the elimination would happen at both Br and Cl, leading to the formation of benzyne. So the product would be benzene with a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, making benzyne.

But benzyne is a very reactive species and might not be isolated. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction stops at the diene stage, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is about the number of possible organic products. So if the starting material is 1,2-dibromobenzene, the reaction would produce benzyne, which is a single product. But perhaps benzyne can rearrange into different products, but under the reaction conditions, maybe only one product is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material isn't a dihalide. Let me think again. The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Maybe the 'd' stands for a deuterium, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo for a methyl group. So 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene.

In that case, the structure would be bromine at position 1 and methyl at position 2. Then, treating with NaNH2, which is a strong base, perhaps deprotonates the benzylic position, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a double bond.

Wait, in 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, the methyl group is at position 2, adjacent to Br at position 1. So the benzylic position would be the methyl group. NaNH2 may abstract a hydrogen from the methyl group, leading to the formation of a benzyl radical? Or perhaps more accurately, if the hydrogen is abstracted from the methyl group, the adjacent Br could leave, forming a double bond between positions 1 and 2.

Wait, but the methyl group is attached to position 2. So if the base abstracts a hydrogen from the methyl group, perhaps the Br at position 1 is eliminated, forming a double bond between positions 1 and 2, and a methyl group at position 2. So the product would be 1,2-diphenylethylene or styrene derivative?

Wait, maybe the product would be an aryl alkene. So benzene with a double bond between positions 1 and 2, and a methyl group at position 2. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C6H4-CH3? Wait, no, perhaps it's benzene with a substituent at position 2 which is CH2, with a double bond between positions 1 and 2.

Wait, let me think. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene. When NaNH2 deprotonates the benzylic hydrogen (the hydrogen attached to the methyl group at position 2), the methyl becomes CH2- and then the Br leaves, forming a double bond between C1 and C2.

So the product would be 1,2-diphenylethylene? Wait, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a double bond between positions 1 and 2, and a methyl group on position 2. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a CH2 group at position 2, and a double bond between positions 1 and 2. So the molecule would be 2-phenyl-1-propenyl benzene? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's benzene with a substituent at position 2 which is CH2, and a double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure would be benzene ring with CH2-CH2? No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the product is styrene. Wait, styrene is benzene with a vinyl group. So if the reaction forms a double bond between C1 and C2, with the methyl group at C2, then the structure would be a benzene ring with a CH2-CH2 group? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a benzene ring with a double bond between positions 1 and 2, and a methyl group attached to position 2 as part of the double bond. So it would be a benzene ring with a CH2-CH2 group, but that's unusual.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. If the starting material is bromobenzene with a methyl group at position 2, then when the base abstracts a hydrogen from the methyl group (beta to the Br), the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between the benzene ring and the carbon where the H was abstracted.

So the structure would be benzene ring with a CH2 group at position 2, but that's not correct. Alternatively, the elimination would form a double bond between the benzene ring and the adjacent carbon.

Wait, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) at position 2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a triple bond if two eliminations occur. But that would require two leaving groups. Oh, wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. So if the starting molecule only has one Br, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed as elimination. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the starting material has two good leaving groups. If the structure is 1-bromo-2-chlorobenzene, then two leaving groups are present. Then, the base can abstract beta hydrogens adjacent to either Br or Cl, leading to two different elimination paths. For example, eliminating Br and H would form a triple bond between 1 and 2. Similarly, eliminating Cl and H would form the same triple bond. So the product would be benzyne, a single product.

But wait, perhaps in such a case, the elimination could happen in two ways, but since the molecule is symmetric, maybe it doesn't matter. So regardless of which leaving group is eliminated first, the product would be the same aryne.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a double bond, not a triple bond. Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, so more likely to cause double elimination (forming triple bond) rather than single elimination (forming double bond).

So, if the starting material is 1,2-dibromobenzene, the reaction would form benzyne. Benzyne itself isn't a stable molecule and might undergo further reactions, but under the given conditions, perhaps it's the main product.

Now, the question is about how many possible organic products are formed. So if only benzyne is formed, then only one product. But wait, maybe there are other possible products.

Wait, another possibility is that the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Then, the strong base could abstract a hydrogen from the methyl groups, leading to elimination of Br and the formation of a double bond. But wait, that would require the methyl groups to be in positions that allow for elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. The base could abstract a hydrogen from position 3, leading to elimination of Br from position 1, forming a double bond between positions 1 and 2, and another hydrogen from position 5 leading to elimination of another group, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, and the base abstracts a hydrogen from the methyl group, leading to the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 2. So the product would be 1,2-diphenylethylene or something similar.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of the possible outcomes.

If the starting material is 1,2-dibromobenzene, and NaNH2 is added, it would deprotonate at positions adjacent to the Br atoms, leading to the formation of benzyne. Benzyne is a single product.

Alternatively, if the starting material is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, the base could abstract a hydrogen from the methyl group, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a double bond, resulting in a styrene-like compound.

In that case, how many products would form? If the starting material is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, the base removes a hydrogen from the methyl group, leading to the formation of a double bond between the ring and the adjacent carbon. Since the methyl group is at position 2, the double bond would be between positions 1 and 2, making the product 1,2-diphenylethylene or 1-phenyl-1-propene.

Wait, but in such a scenario, the product would be a substituted styrene. However, since the starting material is symmetrical (if it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene), would the elimination lead to only one product?

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to only one product because the structure is such that only one position allows for elimination. So the product would be a single compound.

Wait, but the question provides options, and one of the options is 1 product. So if the reaction leads to only one product, then the answer would be B) 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material isn't symmetric, leading to different products.

Wait, let's recap. The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. If the '2-d' is a substituent, perhaps it's a deuterium, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and the structure is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene.

Assuming that, the reaction with NaNH2 would deprotonate the methyl group, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a double bond. So the product would be 1-phenylpropene or something similar. But since there's only one way to eliminate, only one product forms.

Alternatively, if the starting material has two substituents, such as two methyl groups at positions 2 and 4, then deprotonation could occur at either methyl group, leading to two different products. But that's not the case here.

Wait, but the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, which I'm now thinking is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene. So when NaNH2 is added, it abstracts a hydrogen from the methyl group, leading to elimination of Br and forming a double bond between positions 1 and 2. So the product would be a benzene ring with a substituent that's CH2=CH-. So the product would be 1-phenyl-1-propene or 2-phenylethene (styrene).

Wait, but styrene is 2-phenylethene, which would be a vinyl group attached to the benzene ring. So that would be a single product.

So in this case, only one product is formed. So the answer would be option B) 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Then, the base could abstract a hydrogen from either the methyl at position 2 or 4. But depending on the positions, the elimination could occur in two different ways, leading to two different products. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

But given the options, I'm trying to see which makes sense. If the starting material is 1,2-dibromobenzene, then only benzyne is formed, which is one product. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, then one product is formed. But wait, another possibility is that the reaction could form more than one product if the elimination can occur in different ways.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene, but I don't have enough information.

Wait, another approach: the reaction NaNH2 in ammonia is typically used for dehydrohalogenation to form alkynes, but that's in the case of vicinal dihalides. So for a di-substituted benzene with two adjacent halogens, the reaction would produce benzyne, which is a single product.

If the starting material is a dihalide, then the product is benzyne. But if the starting material is mono-halide, then the reaction may not proceed. Alternatively, if the starting material is a mono-halide with another substituent that can act as a leaving group, like a methyl group, but that's not typical.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene. Then, the reaction with NaNH2 would eliminate both Cl and Br, leading to benzyne. So again, one product.

But the initial structure is unclear. The question states 1-bromobenzene-2-d, which is confusing. Without knowing the correct structure, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'd' is a typo, and it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Then, the base could abstract a hydrogen from either methyl group, leading to two different products.

Wait, but 2 and 4 are meta to each other. So upon elimination, would that lead to two different products? Or would they be the same due to symmetry?

If the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, then the methyl groups are at positions 2 and 4. The base could abstract a hydrogen from either the methyl at 2 or the one at 4, leading to two different eliminations. But since the molecule is symmetrical, these eliminations would lead to the same product. So only one product would form.

Wait, but if the elimination leads to a double bond between positions 1 and 2, and another between 1 and 4, but that's not possible because position 4 is across the ring. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination occurs at positions adjacent to Br.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

If the reaction produces only benzyne, then it's one product. But if the reaction produces a diene or another product, perhaps more products are formed.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. When treated with NaNH2, the base abstracts a hydrogen from the methyl group at position 2, leading to elimination of Br and forming a double bond between 1 and 2. Similarly, the base could abstract a hydrogen from the methyl at position 4, leading to elimination of Br and forming a double bond between 1 and 4. However, in benzene, positions 1 and 4 are opposite each other. Wait, but that's impossible because benzene is a six-membered ring, so position 4 is across from position 1. So a double bond between 1 and 4 would not make sense because they're opposite each other, not adjacent.

So perhaps when the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 2, a double bond forms between 1 and 2, leading to a product. But if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6 (which is adjacent to position 1), that would also lead to a double bond between 1 and 6, but that's the same as position 1 and 2 in the case of benzene numbering. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as elimination but as something else, like a substitution. But in that case, NaNH2 is a strong base and a good nucleophile, but aromatic substitution is not common unless the ring is activated.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that typically requires strong activating groups. Bromobenzene isn't activated enough for that. So I think elimination is more likely.

Given all this, I'm going to make an educated guess. The starting material is 1,2-dibromobenzene. The reaction with NaNH2 in ammonia forms benzyne, which is a single product. So the number of products is one. Therefore, the answer is option B) 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. The structure of the starting material is unclear due to the ambiguity of "2-d," but several interpretations were considered:

1. **If the starting material is 1,2-dibromobenzene**:  
   NaNH₂, a strong base, would abstract β-hydrogens adjacent to the bromine atoms, leading to the elimination of both bromine atoms and the formation of benzyne (a highly strained aryne intermediate). Benzyne is a single product under these reaction conditions.

2. **If the starting material is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene**:  
   The base could abstract a benzylic hydrogen from the methyl group at position 2, leading to the elimination of bromine and the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 2. This would result in a single product, likely a styrene-like compound.

3. **If the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene**:  
   The base could abstract hydrogens from either methyl group at positions 2 or 4. However, due to the symmetry of the molecule, this would lead to only one distinct product.

In all plausible scenarios, the reaction produces a single organic product. Therefore, the number of possible organic products is **1**.

Answer: B
