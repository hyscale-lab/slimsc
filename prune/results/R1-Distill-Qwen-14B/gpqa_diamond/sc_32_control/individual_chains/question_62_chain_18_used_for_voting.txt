Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these synthesis problems. But I'll give it a shot. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde starting from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down.

First, I'll draw the target molecule. The name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group attached. The substituent is at position 1, which is the same as the position where the aldehyde is attached, right? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the numbering might be a bit tricky here. Let me think. The substituent is on the cyclohexane ring as a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group. So, the main chain is cyclohexane with a CH2 group attached, which is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. And there's also a formyl (CHO) group on the cyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring where one of the carbons has a CHO group, and another carbon is attached to a CH2 group, which in turn is connected to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. So, it's a cyclohexane with two substituents: one is the CHO, the other is a CH2(OH)CH2-cyclohexane? No, wait, wait. Let me try drawing it mentally.

Wait, the substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), meaning the methyl group (CH2-) is attached to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. So the structure is cyclohexane with a CH2-OH and a CH2-cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon? Or wait, maybe the substituent is a CH2 attached to a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group. So, the main chain is cyclohexane, and on one carbon, there's a CHO group, and on the adjacent carbon, a CH2 group which is connected to both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the target molecule as having a cyclohexane ring where position 1 has the aldehyde group (CHO), and position 1 also has a substituent which is a CH2 group attached to a hydroxyl (OH) and a cyclohexane ring.

Wait, maybe that's getting too detailed. Alternatively, perhaps the target has a cyclohexane ring with a -CH2CHO group, and a substituent that's a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon as a hydroxyl group. So, the structure is cyclohexane with a CH2CHO and a CH2OH group attached to the same carbon, with that CH2 also bonded to another cyclohexane ring? No, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the target molecule is a cyclohexane ring where one of the carbons is attached to a carbonyl group (CHO), and another carbon is attached to a CH2 group that's connected to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-CHO and cyclohexane-CH2-OH and cyclohexane-CH2-cyclohexane? Not quite sure, but perhaps that's not the main point. The main point is the synthesis steps.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a triple bond (ethynyl group) attached. So, it's cyclohexane-C≡CH.

Now, the target molecule is an aldehyde and has a hydroxyl group attached via a CH2 group to a cyclohexyl group. So, perhaps the ethynyl group is functionalized in some way to form the aldehyde and the hydroxyl group.

Let me think about possible reaction steps. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is an alkyne. One common approach is to perform a hydroboration, oxidation, or another method to add groups to the triple bond.

But wait, the target has an aldehyde group. That suggests that perhaps the triple bond is being converted into a carbonyl group. One way to do that is through a hydration reaction. For example, the triple bond can be hydrated to form a ketone, but perhaps under specific conditions, it can form an aldehyde. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl via a different pathway.

Wait, another approach is to use a method to add a methyl group to the triple bond, making it a propargyl group, which can then be oxidized. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group via some reaction.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group. So maybe the ethynyl group is being converted into a CH2 group that's connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group, as well as an aldehyde group.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is used to form a ketone, and then the ketone is further functionalized.

Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a hydroxyl group in a certain position, but I'm not quite sure.

Wait, let me think about the options given. The options are all sequences of reagents, so perhaps I can work backward from the options to see what each sequence does.

The options are A, B, C, D. Each option has four steps.

Let me look at each option:

Option A:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd
3. Ba(OH)2
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, used for deprotonation. Methyl chloride (CH3Cl) could be an alkylating agent. So step 1 might be an alkylation. Then step 2 is H2 with Pd, which is hydrogenation. Step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base used in elimination reactions, maybe for epoxide openings or for elimination (like in dihydroxylation). Step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O — that sounds like acid-catalyzed hydration or something else, maybe oxidation? Or could be for epoxide ring opening.

Option B:
1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/ H2O
4. NH4OH

Step 1: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride — likely an alkylation. Step 2: Li and liquid NH3 is used for elimination reactions, like in the Birch reduction or for dehydrohalogenation. Hmm, Li in NH3 is a strong base, maybe for deprotonation or elimination. Step 3: O3 followed by H2O — that's ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. Step 4: NH4OH is ammonium hydroxide, which is a mild reducing agent, perhaps used in the workup after ozonolysis.

Option C:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate
3. O3/(CH3)2S
4. Ba(OH)2

Step 1: Alkylation again. Step 2: H2 with Pd and CaCO3 — so that's hydrogenation, perhaps of a triple bond to a single bond. Step 3: Ozone with (CH3)2S — which is a reductive workup, so it would break double bonds into carbonyls. Step 4: Ba(OH)2, which I think is for elimination, maybe forming an epoxide or something else.

Option D:
1. NaNH2, methanol
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/(CH3)2S
4. NH4OH

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol — that's a strong base and a methylating agent. Maybe introducing a methyl group. Step 2: Li and NH3 — again, elimination or deprotonation. Step 3: Ozone with (CH3)2S — that's a reductive workup, avoiding the formation of ozonides into carbonyls. Step 4: NH4OH, same as before.

Hmm. Now, considering the target molecule, which has a cyclohexane ring with a CH2 group that's linked to both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group, and another aldehyde group. So, perhaps the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, undergoes some alkylation and then hydrogenation, followed by oxidation or other reactions.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the target molecule's structure. It's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1, which is a CHO group. And another substituent, maybe at position 1 as well, which is a CH2 group connected to OH and cyclohexyl. Wait, but perhaps the cyclohexyl is part of the same substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the main chain is the cyclohexane with a CH2CHO group, and a CH2OH group attached to the same carbon, but that CH2 also connected to another cyclohexane.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is a cyclohexane ring with a CH2 group that's attached to both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group, and also has a CHO group attached to the ring.

Wait, maybe the target is (1-(cyclohexylmethyl)-1-hydroxycyclohexyl)propanal? No, perhaps not. I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps it's better to think about the reagents and what each step does.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane: cyclohexane-C≡CH.

Step 1 in all options is some alkylation, except option D uses methanol as the methylating agent. Let me think: NaNH2 is a strong base, used to deprotonate things. Methyl chloride (CH3Cl) is an alkylating agent. So, in step 1, perhaps ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2 and CH3Cl, leading to alkylation of the terminal alkyne. Wait, but alkyne terminal (sp-hybridized) is quite acidic, so deprotonating with a strong base like NaNH2 would form a cyclohexylacetylide. Then, treating with CH3Cl would perform an alkylation. So, for example, the alkyne (ethynylcyclohexane) would form a cyclohexylacetylide, which upon alkylation with CH3Cl would add a methyl group to the triple bond, turning it into CH2CH2Cl? Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, when you have an acetylide, and you alkylate it with R-X (like CH3Cl), the acetylide (nucleophile) attacks the alkyl halide, adding the R group. So, an acetylide (R-C≡C-) + CH3Cl → R-C≡C-CH3. So the triple bond becomes RC≡C-CH3. But wait, in this case, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, so R is cyclohexyl. So, after alkylation, it becomes cyclohexylpropyne? Because the triple bond is now between the cyclohexane and a methyl group.

Wait, no: ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-C≡CH. Deprotonating with NaNH2 gives cyclohexylacetylide (cyclohexane-C≡C^- Na^+). Alkylation with CH3Cl would add a methyl group to the acetylide, making cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3, which is 1-cyclohexyl-1-propyne, perhaps.

Then, step 2 in option A is H2/Pd. Hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and Pd would typically hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So, the triple bond (C≡C) would become CH2-CH2. Wait, but hydrogenation of triple bonds usually goes to cis double bonds with Lindlar's catalyst, but with H2 and Pd, perhaps it's a full hydrogenation. So, propyne (C≡C-CH3) would become CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, propyne is HC≡C-CH3. Hydrogenation would add two H's across the triple bond. So, C≡C becomes CH2. So HC≡C-CH3 → CH2-CH2-CH3, but that would be propane.

Wait, but wait. Our molecule after step 1 is cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. So, when hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, the triple bond becomes a single bond, so it becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, that's cyclohexane with a propyl group attached. Wait, but that seems a bit off. So, the molecule becomes cyclohexylpropane? But the target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group, but with an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon.

Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right path. Let me think about another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is functionalized to form a carbonyl group. Another reaction involving NaNH2 and a methyl chloride could be forming a quaternary ammonium salt, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone. One way to make a ketone from an alkyne is through hydration, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, another thought: maybe the alkyne is converted into an epoxide, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is used to form a carbonyl group via a different method, like through a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes both an aldehyde and a CH2 group with hydroxyl and cyclohexyl.

Wait, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is first converted into a diol via some method, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group. How can that be done? One method is oxymercuration, but that typically forms alcohols, not aldehydes. Alternatively, oxidation of the triple bond under certain conditions.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group via a hydrohalogenation followed by elimination. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then subjected to dihydroxylation (like with OsO4) to form a diol, which could then undergo some elimination or oxidation.

But let me think about the options again. Let's look at option C:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride — so alkylation of the acetylide to form a propargyl group.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate — that's hydrogenation, so the triple bond becomes CH2.

Then, step 3: O3/(CH3)2S — that's ozonolysis with a reductive workup, so the double bonds (if any) would be cleaved into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but wait. After step 2, we have a single bond, so no double bonds. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, after step 1: we have cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would convert C≡C into CH2, so the molecule becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But that's a single bond. So, in step 3, we have O3. Ozonolysis would require a double bond. But after hydrogenation, there's no double bond. So perhaps this is a problem. So, option C's step 3 might not make sense because after step 2, there's no double bond to ozonolyze.

Wait, unless I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 doesn't hydrogenate the triple bond all the way. Wait, no, H2 and Pd typically hydrogenate triple bonds to single bonds, not double bonds.

Hmm, perhaps I'm thinking about this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a diene or another structure before ozonolysis. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene instead of a single bond. How? Oh, with Lindlar's catalyst, hydrogenation of an alkyne would give a cis-alkene. But in this case, the catalyst is Pd, which is typically for full hydrogenation.

Wait, so perhaps option C is incorrect because after step 2, there's no double bond. Unless I made a mistake.

Wait, stepping back, let me think about the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexane ring with a CH2CHO group and a CH2 group that's connected to a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group. So, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a CH2CHO group, but how?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group via a hydration reaction. For example, the triple bond could be hydrated to form a ketone, but then how to get an aldehyde?

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH) under acidic hydration would form cyclohexane with a CH(OH)CH3 group. But that's a ketone, which would be cyclohexanecarbinone.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde group, so that's a CHO group. So, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group in such a way as to form the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a propargyl alcohol, which could then be oxidized.

Wait, perhaps the sequence involves making a propargyl alcohol first. For example, using H2O with HgSO4 and H2SO4 (hydration of the alkyne to form a ketone?), but that would give a ketone, which is not what we want.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a propargyl group, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl.

Wait, oxidation of propargyl alcohols can form ketones, but I'm not sure about aldehydes.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride — alkylation of the acetylide to make a longer chain.

2. Li in liquid NH3 — perhaps dehydrohalogenation or elimination. Maybe to form a double bond.

3. O3, H2O — ozonolysis of the double bond, breaking it into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH — workup, perhaps to convert ozonides into carbonyls without over-oxidizing.

So, let's imagine step 1: ethynylcyclohexane → treated with NaNH2 and ethyl chloride → the acetylide (cyclohexylacetylide) reacts with ethyl chloride to form cyclohexyl-1-ethynyl-ethyl? Wait, no, I think it would form cyclohexyl-1-propynyl chloride? Or perhaps cyclohexyl-1-propynyl something. Not sure, but perhaps the product would be cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Then, step 2: Li in NH3 — this is a strong base. Li in ammonia is used for Birch reductions or eliminations. If the molecule is a propargyl chloride (perhaps), then Li in NH3 might cause elimination, forming a triple bond into a double bond. Wait, but the molecule after step 1 is a propargyl chloride.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkyne again, but that seems redundant.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li in NH3 is used for some kind of elimination to form a double bond. So, if we have a propargyl chloride, perhaps elimination would form a triple bond again, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a different reaction. Maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction, but Li in NH3 is more about elimination or reductions.

Hmm, perhaps this option isn't the right path.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol — alkylation of the acetylide with methanol as the methylating agent. So, the acetylide (cyclohexylacetylide) would react with methanol to form cyclohexyl-1-methoxypropyne? Or perhaps methanol would provide a methyl group, making cyclohexyl-1-propynyl methyl ether? Not sure. But methanol as an alkylating agent usually would provide a methyl group, but it's a poor methylating agent unless in a strong base, which NaNH2 would provide.

Wait, but methanol is a primary alkylating agent. Reacting an acetylide with methyl chloride is more common for alkylation because CH3Cl is a better electrophile than MeOH. So, perhaps option D's step 1 isn't alkylation but something else. Or maybe it's for forming a methyl ether.

Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think about another approach. Perhaps the target molecule is synthesized via a method where the ethynyl group is converted into a CH2CHO group and a CH2OH group attached to a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, the target molecule's substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), meaning a CH2 group attached to OH and cyclohexyl. So, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a CH2-OH group via some method.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group, and then further functionalized. For example, using a propargyl alcohol, which could then be oxidized to a carbonyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is used to form an epoxide, but that's not straightforward.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a cyclohexylmethyl group via some addition.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about each option's reagents in order and see what they do.

Let me take option C:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation of the triple bond, leading to a propargyl group. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexyl-1-propyne (cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3).

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenation of the triple bond to a single bond. So, now we have cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But wait, that's a three-carbon chain attached to the cyclohexane. Now, step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis is used on double bonds. But in this molecule, after step 2, there's no double bond. So, perhaps this is impossible. So, option C's step 3 would not work because there's nothing to ozonolyze.

Hmm, so perhaps option C is incorrect.

Option B:

Step 1: NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkylation of the triple bond to form cyclohexyl-1-propyne (perhaps cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH2Cl?) Wait, no, perhaps after alkylation, it's cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Wait, wait. Let me think: ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-C≡CH. Deprotonating with NaNH2 gives cyclohexylacetylide (cyclohexane-C≡C^- Na^+). Treating with ethyl chloride (CH2CH3Cl), the acetylide would attack the ethyl chloride, adding an ethyl group to the acetylide. So, the product would be cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Then, step 2: Li in liquid NH3. This is a strong base, used for elimination. The molecule after step 1 is a propargyl ethyl ether? Or perhaps a propargyl chloride? Wait, no, if you have CH2CH3Cl, then the product after alkylation would be cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH3, which is a propargyl group. So, Li in NH3 is used for elimination. Maybe removing a proton to form a double bond.

Wait, but in this molecule (cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH3), the propargyl group is attached to the cyclohexane. If you eliminate a hydrogen, perhaps from the CH2CH3 group, you could form a double bond between the propargyl and the adjacent carbon. So, the triple bond becomes a double bond.

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the Li in NH3 is used to deprotonate the compound, forming a lithium acetylide again, but that doesn't seem helpful.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Another option: looking at option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. So, the acetylide is treated with methanol. But methanol is a poor electrophile for alkylation. Alternatively, perhaps it's for forming a methyl ether. Or perhaps it's a quenching step.

Wait, perhaps after deprotonating the ethynylcyclohexane to form the acetylide, treating with methanol would lead to an alkylation via a different mechanism. Methanol could act as a methylating agent, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the NaNH2 and methanol is used for deprotonation and then quenching, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about each option's possible product.

Let me think about the target molecule again. It has an aldehyde group and a hydroxyl group attached to the same carbon as a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is used to form both the aldehyde and the hydroxyl group. How can that happen?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group, and then further functionalized.

Wait, the triple bond can be converted into a ketone via hydration (with HgSO4 and H2SO4), but that would give cyclohexanecarbinone, which is a ketone. But the target has an aldehyde, not a ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into an aldehyde via some method. For example, using O3 followed by reductive workup. Wait, but that would require a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a double bond via hydrogenation, then ozonolysed to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, let's imagine:

Step 1: hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond. That can be done with H2 and Lindlar's catalyst, but the options don't have Lindlar's. Alternatively, perhaps using H2 and a different catalyst.

Wait, but looking at option B, step 2 is Li in NH3. Not sure.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option involves introducing a methyl group via alkylation, then hydrogenation, then ozonolysis, and then some workup.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to alkylate the triple bond, hydrogenate it to form a double bond, then ozonolyse the double bond to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, if the triple bond is alkylated to form a longer chain, then hydrogenated to a double bond, then ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyls.

Let me think about that.

Suppose:

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane.

Step 1: alkylation with methyl chloride to form cyclohexylpropynylCH3.

Step 2: hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond. Wait, but that's not possible with H2 and Pd; that typically hydrogenates to a single bond. Oh, wait, maybe using a different catalyst, like Lindlar's, would give a cis double bond. But the options don't mention that.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond, then another reaction.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the target molecule has both an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group on adjacent carbons. Perhaps this comes from an ozonolysis step that breaks a double bond into two carbonyl groups. Then, one of them is a CHO and the other is a CH2OH group.

Wait, for example, if we have a diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. So, perhaps our molecule undergoes ozonolysis to form the aldehyde and the hydroxyl group.

So, how can we get a diene from ethynylcyclohexane?

Wait, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is first alkylated, then hydrogenated to form a diene.

Alternatively, after alkylation, elimination forms a diene.

Wait, perhaps:

Step 1: Alkylation of ethynylcyclohexane to form a longer chain.

Step 2: elimination to form a diene.

Step 3: Ozonolysis to form two carbonyl groups.

Step 4: Workup to form the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups.

But I'm not certain.

Another approach: think about each reagent's role.

Option B:

Step 3 is O3, H2O. That's oxidative ozonolysis, which breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups.

Step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent, perhaps used to prevent over-oxidation or to form amines from imines, but not sure.

So, for option B, after step 2, which is Li and NH3, perhaps a diene is formed, which upon ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups.

So, let's try to walk through option B:

Step 1: NaNH2, ethyl chloride. Ethynylcyclohexane → cyclohexylacetylide → reacts with ethyl chloride to form cyclohexyl-1-propyne (cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH3).

Step 2: Li in NH3. This is a strong base. Maybe it abstracts a proton adjacent to the triple bond, leading to an elimination and forming a triple bond again, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the Li in NH3 is for deprotonation and elimination to form a double bond. So, the propargyl chloride (if any) might form an alkene.

Wait, but after step 1, the structure is cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2CH3. Treating with Li in NH3 might lead to deprotonation and elimination, forming a triple bond to a double bond. But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li in NH3 is for a Birch reduction, but that typically reduces aromatic rings, which aren't present here.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think of another approach. The target molecule has both an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group. Perhaps one of the steps involves oxidation to form the aldehyde and another step forms the hydroxyl group.

Wait, another possibility: after forming a diol from a diene via ozonolysis, one of the diol groups is oxidized to an aldehyde, and the other becomes a hydroxyl group.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct reagents are those that form a carbonyl group via oxidation. For example, using HgSO4 and H2SO4 (hydration of an alkyne to a ketone), but that would give a ketone, not an aldehyde.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde. So perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a propargyl alcohol, then oxidized to an aldehyde.

How to do that? Propargyl alcohol can be oxidized to an aldehyde using certain reagents. For example, using CrO3 in H2SO4 could oxidize the propargyl alcohol to a ketone, but maybe under milder conditions, it could form an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps using O3 followed by a reductive workup could form an aldehyde.

Wait, but that requires a double bond.

Wait, let me think. If the triple bond is first converted into a double bond, then ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups. So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to form a longer chain.

2. Hydrogenation of the triple bond to a double bond (but with a different catalyst?).

3. Ozonolysis to break the double bond into carbonyls.

But I'm not seeing that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → alkylation with MeOH. So, the acetylide (cyclohexylacetylide) reacts with methanol to form cyclohexylmethoxyacetylide? Or perhaps a methyl ether.

Wait, perhaps the product is cyclohexyl-1-methoxypropyne. Not sure.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → elimination, perhaps forming a triple bond again, but I don't know.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 1, the molecule is treated with Li in NH3, leading to elimination and formation of a double bond.

Then, step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S → reductive workup, forming carbonyl groups.

Step 4: NH4OH → maybe to form an amine or to adjust pH.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about each option's steps and see which one logically leads to the target structure.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a CH2 group connected to both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group, and another substituent which is an aldehyde group.

So, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a CH2CHO group and a CH2OH group.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is first alkylated to form a propargyl group, then hydrogenated to form a CH2-CH2 group, which is then oxidized to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, but how to get both the aldehyde and the hydroxyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a CH2 group via hydrogenation, and then that CH2 is functionalized.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a CH2 group, then that CH2 is oxidized to a carbonyl group (CHO), and another group is introduced as a hydroxyl.

But I'm not sure.

Hmm, given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look at the options again and think about the plausible steps.

Looking at option C:

Step 1: Alkylate the acetylide with methyl chloride → cyclohexylpropynylCH3.

Step 2: H2, Pd → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond → cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: O3, (CH3)2S → but no double bond, so no reaction. So this can't be right.

Option B:

Step 1: Alkylation with ethyl chloride → longer chain.

Step 2: Li, NH3 → maybe elimination to form a double bond.

If step 2 forms a double bond, then step 3 (O3, H2O) would break it into carbonyl groups.

So, perhaps the molecule after step 2 is a cyclohexane with a double bond adjacent to the ring.

Then, ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups.

Assuming that, after ozonolysis, we'd have two carbonyl groups.

Then, step 4: NH4OH → perhaps to form hydroxyl groups from carbonyls, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but ozone followed by H2O gives carbonyl groups, and then treatment with NH4OH (a mild base) might not change that.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis is followed by reductive workup with Zn or something else.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another angle: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group, which also has a hydroxyl group. So, perhaps the CH2 group is formed from the triple bond via some method, and then hydroxylated.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation to form a propargyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to form a CH2 group.

3. Ozonolysis to introduce a carbonyl group.

4. Some kind of oxidation or workup to form the hydroxyl group.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D:

Step 1: Alkylation with methanol → perhaps forms a methyl ether.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → perhaps elimination to form a double bond.

Then, ozonolysis would form carbonyl groups.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option C:

1. Alkylate to form a propargyl group.

2. Hydrogenate to single bond.

Wait, but then no double bond for ozonolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkylation to make a propargyl group.

2. Elimination to form a diene.

3. Ozonolysis to break into two carbonyls.

4. Workup to form aldehyde and hydroxyl.

So, after ozonolysis, two carbonyls are formed, which upon workup become aldehyde and alcohol.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Given my confusion, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

Looking at the options, option C's step 3 uses O3 with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup, leading to formation of aldehydes and ketones without over-oxidation. So, if the molecule after step 2 has a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

In option C, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. Wait, but that would mean no double bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't have anything to act on. So option C is probably incorrect.

Option B's step 2 is Li in NH3, which might form a double bond via elimination. So after step 2, there's a double bond, which would be cleaved by ozonolysis in step 3.

So, let's imagine:

After step 1: ethynylcyclohexane → cyclohexylpropynylCH2CH3.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → elimination to form a double bond. So, cyclohexane with a double bond adjacent.

Then, step 3: O3 → cleaves the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, the molecule would have two carbonyls.

Step 4: NH4OH → perhaps to work up the ozonolysis, forming the aldehyde and the hydroxyl group.

But I'm not sure about the exact transformations. However, considering the steps, option B might be the correct one.

Alternatively, option D's step 1 uses methanol, which might form a methyl ether, but I'm not certain.

In the end, I think the correct option is B. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct.

Wait, another angle: the target has a hydroxyl group and an aldehyde on the same carbon. That suggests that perhaps the molecule underwent a vinylogous oxidation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is D.

After careful consideration, I think the correct option is B. But I'm not entirely sure, so I'll go with option C.

Wait, no, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should pick option C.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct option is C.

But I'm not confident. Given all this, I think the correct answer is option C.

Wait, no, I'm probably wrong. Maybe option D.

Hmm.

After much thinking, I think the correct answer is option C. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps option B.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. I'm going to go with option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule contains a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes a CH2 group attached to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group, as well as an aldehyde group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Option A:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: This step likely alkylates the terminal alkyne of ethynylcyclohexane, forming a propargyl group.
2. **H2/Pd**: This step hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in a saturated chain.
3. **Ba(OH)2**: This step is typically used for elimination or epoxide formation, but the product after step 2 does not suggest an obvious role for Ba(OH)2.
4. **H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**: This step could involve acid-catalyzed hydration or oxidation, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the target molecule.

### Option B:
1. **NaNH2, ethyl chloride**: This step alkylates the terminal alkyne, forming a longer chain.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: This step likely induces elimination, forming a double bond.
3. **O3/H2O**: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH4OH**: This step could adjust the pH or stabilize the carbonyl groups. This sequence plausibly forms the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups in the target molecule.

### Option C:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: This step alkylates the terminal alkyne, forming a propargyl group.
2. **H2/Pd-calcium carbonate**: This step hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, but no double bond is formed, making ozonolysis in step 3 ineffective.
3. **O3/(CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is absent after step 2, rendering this step irrelevant.
4. **Ba(OH)2**: This step does not align with the target molecule's structure.

### Option D:
1. **NaNH2, methanol**: This step likely forms a methyl ether or introduces a methyl group.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: This step could induce elimination, forming a double bond.
3. **O3/(CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH4OH**: This step could adjust the pH or stabilize the carbonyl groups. While plausible, the initial step with methanol is less clear compared to other options.

### Conclusion:
Option B provides the most logical sequence for forming the target molecule. The alkylation step forms a longer chain, elimination creates a double bond, ozonolysis cleaves it into carbonyl groups, and the final step adjusts the functional groups to match the target structure. Option C is less likely because ozonolysis cannot act on a single bond, and the other options either fail to form the required functional groups or involve unclear steps.

**Answer: B**
