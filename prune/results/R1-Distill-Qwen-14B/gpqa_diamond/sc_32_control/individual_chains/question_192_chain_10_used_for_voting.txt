Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. 

The setup is a bit complicated. There's a spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small cavity. The cavity isn't at the center; it's shifted by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and since r is less than R, the cavity is entirely within the conductor. 

Now, they've placed a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. And the question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l is bigger than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, I should remember how charges distribute in conductors. Oh right, in electrostatics, the charges on a conductor reside on the surface. And for a conductor with a cavity, the charges induced are such that the cavity's interior has no electric field if the conductor is neutral. But in this case, the conductor is uncharged, right?

Wait, the conductor is uncharged, but there's a charge +q inside the cavity. So how does that affect the conductor? Oh, right, the conductor being neutral, the charges inside the cavity would induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Let me think. The inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of -q, because it's a conductor and the charges will arrange themselves to cancel the electric field inside the conductor material. And since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge +q. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor, so at a distance L from the conductor's center. The conductor itself has a charge of +q on its outer surface. So for any point outside, the electric field should be the same as if all the charge +q were concentrated at the center. Because of the shell theorem, right? So the conductor's induced charge acts as if it's a point charge at the center for external points.

But wait, the charge inside the cavity is at some position. Does that affect the field outside? No, because the conductor's own induced charges shield the inside. For points outside, it's the conductor's outer charge that matters, and that's +q. So the electric field at P would be as if the +q is at the center of the conductor.

So the formula for the electric field due to a point charge is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / r², where r is the distance from the charge to the point. Here, the distance L is from the conductor's center to P. So E should be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options, option B is exactly this. Option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². 

Wait, but wait another thing. The point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, and the cavity's center is shifted by s. So does that affect the field at P? Hmm. Because the conductor's induced charges are +q on the outer surface, so the field outside depends only on the total charge of the conductor, which is +q, regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is located. So the position of the charge inside the cavity doesn't matter for points outside the conductor. So the field at P is only due to the +q on the conductor's outer surface.

So, yeah, the answer should be option B.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ (where $r < R$) inside it. The cavity is shifted from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The goal is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and $l > R$. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

To solve this, we analyze the charge distribution and electric field:

1. **Charge Distribution**: Since the conductor is uncharged, the inner surface of the conductor must develop an induced charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor material. The outer surface of the conductor, being neutral overall, must then have a charge of $+q$.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For any point outside the conductor, the electric field is determined by the total charge on the conductor's outer surface. According to the shell theorem, the electric field outside a spherical charge distribution depends only on the total charge enclosed, as if it were concentrated at the center. Thus, the electric field at point $P$ is due to the $+q$ charge on the conductor's outer surface.

3. **Independence of Cavity Position**: The position of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity does not affect the electric field outside the conductor. The induced charges on the conductor shield the interior, and the field outside depends only on the total charge of the conductor.

4. **Electric Field Formula**: The electric field at point $P$, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor, is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

5. **Analysis of Options**: 
   - Option A and C involve terms like $(l \pm s \cos\theta)^2$, which are irrelevant for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - Option D uses $l^2$, which is also incorrect because the field depends on $L^2$, not $l^2$.
   - Option B correctly gives the electric field as $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$, which matches the analysis.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
