Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of organic chemistry. But let's see what I can do.

The question is about two reactions where a chemist used two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds to get the same product, but with different configurations. The product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one for reaction A, and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one for reaction B.

Hmm, wait, no. Let me read that again. Oh no, actually, looking at the problem statement, both reactions produce the same product but with different configurations. Wait, no, no. The products are (R) for A and (S) for B. So the same compound but enantiomers? Or maybe diastereomers? Wait, no, same product? No, wait, no, the same product but different configurations? Or is each reaction producing a different product? Wait, no, the product is the same compound but with different stereochemistry.

Wait, the question says, for reaction A, starting material A is treated with LiBH4 and H+ to give (R)-4-ethyl... and reaction B uses starting material B treated with BH3 and H+ to give (S)-4-ethyl...

Wait, no, actually, looking at the question again: it's two reactions. Each reaction gives a product with a specific configuration. So reaction A using LiBH4 gives R, and reaction B using BH3 gives S.

Wait, but the product is the same compound, just R and S configurations. Wait, no, the product is (R) in one case and (S) in the other. Hmm, wait, the same compound is produced, but with opposite configurations? Or perhaps it's the same structure but different stereocenters, but I think in this case, the product is the same molecule but an enantiomer.

Wait, but both reactions give 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one with different configurations. So perhaps the starting material had a carbonyl group that upon reduction would form an alcohol, which then undergoes some rearrangement to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen, right? So tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would have the ring with the oxygen and a ketone at position 2. The structure would be like a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar.

So, looking at the product structure: it's a pyran ring with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. The configuration of the chiral center at position 4 is R for reaction A and S for reaction B.

I think the key here is considering the type of reductant used. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, while BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions. Wait, but in this case, both reactions are reductions. Wait, wait, no. Because LiBH4 is a borohydride reducing agent, used for reducing carbonyl groups. BH3 is usually used in hydroboration-oxidation reactions, which are additions to alkenes, not reductions of ketones.

Wait, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the reactions are different. Let me think. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent for ketones and aldehydes, converting them to alcohols. But BH3 is more for additions to alkenes.

Wait, but in the question, both reactions are using a reducing agent. So perhaps the starting materials are ketones or aldehydes, and the reagents are different. But wait, LiBH4 would reduce a ketone to a secondary alcohol, while BH3... Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides or something else. Alternatively, maybe the reactions are not reducing ketones. Oh wait, wait, maybe the reactions are about the reduction of epoxides or esters? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another approach: the product is a cyclic ketone. Perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones) which upon reduction form cyclic ketones? Or maybe they are some kind of ketals or acetals?

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting materials are cyclic hemiacetals or something that upon reduction would form the cyclic ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters or ketals, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are ketones. For example, if the starting material is a cyclic ketone with a substituent, and the reductant is used to do a ring-opening or something else.

Wait, another angle: looking at the product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the ring is a six-membered ring with oxygen. The ketone is at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4. The configuration is R or S.

So perhaps the starting material is a diethyl ketone or something that can form this structure upon reduction.

Wait, think about the reagents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically for carbonyls. BH3 is more commonly used in hydroboration reactions, but maybe in some cases, it can also reduce carbonyls. Or perhaps the starting materials are esters, and the reduction leads to alcohols.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are esters. For example, if the starting material is an ester like an acyloxy compound. Reducing an ester with LiBH4 would yield a primary alcohol. But how would that form a cyclic ketone?

Alternatively, thinking about the possibility that the starting materials are cyclic ethers with ketone groups. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides. But I'm not sure how that would lead to the product given.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic acetal structures that, upon reduction, form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, another thought: the product is a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal. Wait, no, the product is a cyclic ketone. So if the starting material were a cyclic hemiacetal, which upon reduction...

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters or ketones, and the reaction is a reduction followed by cyclization.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are alpha-keto esters. Let's think about that. An alpha-keto ester has a carbonyl group adjacent to another carbonyl. Reducing that could form a diol, which might cyclize to form a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal or something that, upon reduction, opens and forms the cyclic ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are diethyl acetals of ketones. Then, when treated with a reducing agent, the acetal would open, and the ketone would be reduced to an alcohol, which could then cyclize to form the pyran ring.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. So if the starting material is a diethyl acetal, perhaps the LiBH4 would attack the acetal, breaking it open, and reduce the ketone to an alcohol.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so maybe it's a case of ring formation after a reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. LiBH4 can reduce esters to diols, but I'm not sure how that would form a cyclic ketone.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an ester group that upon reduction forms a diol, which then cyclizes. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is more about the stereochemistry of the reduction. So the starting material has a carbonyl group, and when reduced, the resulting alcohol can form the cyclic structure.

Wait, let me think about the stereochemistry. The product has a chiral center at position 4, with R configuration for reaction A and S for reaction B. So the configuration of the starting material must influence the outcome.

Wait, so when you reduce a ketone to an alcohol, the configuration of the starting material would determine the configuration of the resulting alcohol. But if the starting material is a prochiral ketone, then the reduction would create a chiral center with certain configuration based on the reagent.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically providing a hydride from the BH4^- ion, which is a source of H- (hydride). So in the reduction of a ketone, LiBH4 would add the hydride to the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of an alcohol.

Now, the configuration of the resulting alcohol depends on the structure of the ketone. If the ketone is prochiral, then the hydride attack will determine the configuration of the resulting alcohol.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone. Hmm, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the ring.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the options given.

The options are about the starting materials A and B. All options have the same base structure: 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, but different configurations (R or S) for A and B.

So A and B are both 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, but their configurations are either R or S.

Wait, so the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Let me imagine the structure.

The compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, it's a pentanoic acid (5 carbons), with substituents:

- At carbon 3: ethyl group.
- At carbon 5: isobutoxy group and a ketone (oxo) group.

Wait, but wait, wait. Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-O-(CH2)2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH

Wait, not exactly. Let me write it as:

The structure is pentanoic acid (five carbons, with the COOH at the end). At carbon 3, there's an ethyl group; at carbon 5, there's an isobutoxy group and an oxo (keto) group.

Wait, but carbon 5 can't have both an isobutoxy and a keto group. Wait, wait, no. The formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, the structure would be:

The pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but with substituents. Carbon 3 has an ethyl group.

Wait, the structure is:

Carbon 1: COOH
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: CH(CH2CH3)
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: C=O (keto) and an isobutoxy group.

Wait, how can carbon 5 have both a ketone and an isobutoxy group? That doesn't make much sense because carbon 5 would be the fifth carbon, which is the COOH group. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Wait, perhaps the formula is written as 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but:

- At carbon 3 (the third carbon from COOH), an ethyl group is attached.
- At carbon 5, which is the same as the COOH's position (since pentanoic acid is five carbons), but wait, that doesn't make sense. Carbon 5 in pentanoic acid is the COOH.

Wait, maybe the numbering is different. Maybe it's:

The pentanoic acid is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but:

Carbon 1: COOH
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: CH2
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH3 (if it's pentanoic acid, the chain is five carbons, so perhaps I'm confusing the numbering.)

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

The acid is 3-ethyl-5-(isobutoxy)-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, the chain is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-C(CH2)2CH3)

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me try to draw it.

Carbon 1: COOH
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: CH(CH2CH3) (ethyl group)
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: C=O (keto) and O-isobutyl group.

Wait, so the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-CH(CH2CH3)2)

Wait, but carbon 5 can't have both a ketone and an oxygen substituent. Hmm, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester or something else.

Wait, maybe the molecule is a gamma-keto ester. For example, the structure could be:

COOH-CH2-C(=O)-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something.

Wait, perhaps it's:

The molecule is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which would have the structure:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-R), where R is isobutyl.

Wait, but then the 5-oxo would be on the same carbon as the isobutoxy, which might not be possible because that would imply a geminal di-substitution, which is unlikely for a keto group.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let's imagine the molecule as:

The pentanoic acid has five carbons in the chain. The substituents are at carbons 3 and 5. So:

Carbon 1: COOH
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: CH(CH2CH3) (ethyl group)
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: C(O-) and O-CH2CH(CH2CH3) (isobutoxy group)

Wait, that makes more sense. So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-CH2CH(CH2CH3)).

Wait, but that would make the five-carbon chain:

Positions:

1: COOH
2: CH2
3: CH(CH2CH3)
4: CH2
5: C(O-O-CH2CH(CH2CH3)).

Wait, but that would make the molecule a beta-keto ester. So, it's a gamma-keto ester? Or a beta-keto ester.

Wait, beta-keto esters have the structure RCO-COOR'. Gamma-keto esters have the keto group at the next position.

So, if the starting material is a beta-keto ester, then when you reduce it with LiBH4, what happens?

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and can reduce esters. Wait, but wait, beta-keto esters can undergo various reductions. Let's think: when you reduce a beta-keto ester with LiBH4, you would typically reduce the ester to an alcohol. The ketone, being more reactive, would be reduced first, but wait, LiBH4 usually doesn't reduce ketones as effectively as some other agents, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, LiBH4 can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. But in the presence of esters, which are less reactive, perhaps the ketone is reduced first.

Wait, so if the starting material is a beta-keto ester, like RCOCOR', upon treatment with LiBH4, the ketone group (RCO-) would be reduced to RC(OH)-, but wait, no, that's not right. The ketone would be reduced to an alcohol. So, the structure would become RC(OH)CH2OR'.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, which when reduced would form a diol, leading to the formation of the cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester. Let's assume that the starting material is an alpha-keto ester, which upon reduction becomes a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyran ring.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure how that would work.

Going back to the problem: the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the ring is six-membered, with oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

So perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal or something that, upon reduction, forms this ring.

Wait, another angle: when a cyclic hemiacetal is reduced, it could form a diol, which then rearranges.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and upon reduction, it forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the ring with the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone ester, and upon reduction, it forms a diol which forms the ring.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the stereochemistry part.

The product has a chiral center at position 4, which is R in reaction A and S in reaction B.

So, in each reaction, the starting material must lead to the correct configuration upon reduction.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and when it reduces a ketone, it adds the hydride from the less substituted borohydride. Wait, in the reduction of ketones, the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the configuration of the starting ketone affects the product.

Wait, but if the starting ketone is prochiral, the reduction with a hydride source like LiBH4 would produce an alcohol with a specific configuration based on the approach of the hydride.

Wait, so the configuration of the starting material (if it's a prochiral ketone) would determine the configuration of the resulting alcohol.

Wait, in the case of a cyclic ketone, or a ketone with adjacent substituents, the approach of the hydride would determine the configuration.

So, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone, and when reduced, the position of the hydride addition determines the configuration.

But I'm not entirely clear on that.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters, which upon reduction form diols, which then cyclize to form the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester. Let's say it's something like CH2(COOH)-CO-O-R.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyran ring.

Wait, I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to think of the options again.

The options are about the configurations of the starting materials A and B.

So, option D says A is R and B is S.

Wait, so the starting materials are enantiomers. So when each is reduced with a different reagent, they produce enantiomers.

Wait, but why would different reagents (LiBH4 vs BH3) lead to opposite configurations?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting materials are esters, and the reagents are doing different reductions. For example, LiBH4 might reduce the ester to a primary alcohol, while BH3 might do something else.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting materials are epoxides, and the reagents are opening them to form alcohols. But I'm not sure how that would form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, maybe it's about the reduction of an epoxide. Wait, no, epoxides are ethers, and reducing them would break the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic acetals. For example, a cyclic acetal could be treated with a reducing agent to cleave it, leading to a diol, which then forms the ring.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the reaction that forms a cyclic ketone with a specific configuration. The product is (R) or (S) at position 4.

So, the starting material must have a stereogenic center that, upon reduction, leads to the R or S configuration in the product.

Wait, the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative with substituents at 3 and 5. So the structure might be something like:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-R), where R is isobutyl.

So, the molecule is a beta-keto ester. Because the ketone is at position 5, and the ester is also at position 5? Or perhaps the ester is at position 4.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as:

The molecule is (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-pentanoyl) acid. So, the acid group is on carbon 1, the ethyl on carbon 3, and the isobutoxy and ketone on carbon 5.

So, the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-CH(CH2CH3)2)

Wait, but that would make the ketone and the ester on the same carbon, which is possible but not common. Alternatively, perhaps the isobutoxy is at position 5, and the ketone is at position 5 as well. So, the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-CH2CH(CH2CH3)).

Wait, but that would mean the same carbon (carbon 5) has both a ketone and an ester group, which is an oxo and an ester. That seems unlikely, but perhaps it's a cyclic structure.

Wait, perhaps it’s a cyclic ester, like a lactone. So, the molecule is a gamma-lactone or delta-lactone.

If it's a gamma-lactone, then the ester is between carbons 1 and 4. But in this case, the structure would be a ring with four members, which is less common.

Alternatively, a delta-lactone would have a five-membered ring, which is more common.

Wait, but the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative. So, if it's a gamma-lactone, the ring would be four-membered (since the acid is on carbon 1, and the ester is between 1 and 4, making a four-membered ring).

But four-membered rings are strained, so maybe it's a delta-lactone, a five-membered ring.

Wait, a delta-lactone would have the ester between carbon 1 and 5, but since it's a five-carbon chain, that would make a six-membered ring, which is a lactone. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, and upon reduction, it opens to form a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyran ring.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: look for an example of a similar reaction. For instance, the reduction of a cyclic ketone to form a secondary alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization to form a ring.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, which upon reduction would form a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyran ring with the ketone.

Wait, but again, I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of a cyclic ester (lactone) to form a diol, which then forms the cyclic ketone upon elimination.

Wait, but lactones are reduced to diols, which could then undergo cyclization, but how would that form a ketone?

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester with a ketone substituent. Upon reduction, the ester becomes a diol, which then loses a water molecule to form the ketone.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an acyclic ester with a keto group, and upon reduction, it forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the ring.

Wait, considering all this confusion, perhaps I should think about the stereochemistry part.

The product has a chiral center at position 4. The configuration (R or S) depends on the starting material's configuration and the reagent used.

Assuming that A and B are enantiomers, when treated with different reducing agents, they produce enantiomeric products.

But why would the same starting material (if they were the same) give different products with different reagents? Because perhaps the reagents determine the configuration of the product.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are different reducing agents. Wait, LiBH4 is a borohydride source, which could lead to a certain configuration, while BH3 might not be a reducing agent for that particular functional group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction with LiBH4 is a reduction of a ketone, while the reaction with BH3 is a hydroboration reaction on an alkene, leading to an alcohol with a certain configuration.

Wait, that could make sense. So, if the starting material has a ketone and an alkene, then LiBH4 would reduce the ketone, while BH3 would add to the alkene.

But in the product, there's no alkene; it's a cyclic ketone. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester with an adjacent double bond. When treated with LiBH4, it reduces the ester to a diol, which then undergoes a ring-opening to form the product. Alternatively, when treated with BH3, it adds to the double bond, leading to a different product.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha,beta-epoxy ketone. Then, the reagent could open the epoxide in different ways, leading to different configurations.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, considering time, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

The product for A is R, and for B is S. So if the starting materials are enantiomers, then A and B are R and S configurations, and upon reduction, they would form products with opposite configurations.

Wait, looking at the options, option D says A is R and B is S. So starting materials are enantiomers, so when treated with different reagents, they would produce the opposite configurations.

Wait, but why would different reagents lead to opposite configurations? Unless the reagents cause the reduction to occur from opposite faces, leading to opposite configurations.

Alternatively, perhaps the type of reducing agent affects the configuration of the product.

Wait, for example, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that attacks from the less hindered side, leading to a certain configuration, while BH3 might approach from the other side, leading to the opposite configuration. But I'm not sure if BH3 is used for reducing carbonyls.

Wait, BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions, which follow anti-Markovnikov addition and involve the less substituted boron end attacking the alkene. But if the starting material is a ketone, and BH3 is used, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, maybe in this case, the reagents are reducing the same carbonyl group but with different stereochemistry in the starting material, leading to different configurations in the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is about the reduction of an epoxide, but I'm not certain.

Another thought: perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and the reagents are opening them. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ethers with a substituent, and the reagents are opening them to form diols, which then cyclize.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic acetals that, upon reduction, form diols, which then form the ring.

Wait, but I'm stuck again.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option D: A is R and B is S.

Because when the starting materials are enantiomers, and they are reduced with different reagents, they would produce products with opposite configurations.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the reagents influence the configuration based on their approach.

Wait, another angle: LiBH4 is a bulky reducing agent, so it would approach from the less hindered side, leading to a certain configuration. BH3 might be less bulky, approaching from the other side.

So, if the starting material is R, LiBH4 would reduce it to R, and BH3 would reduce it to S, or vice versa.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the direction of attack for each reagent.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material determines the product's configuration.

Wait, if the starting material is R, then using LiBH4 would produce R, and if starting material is S, using BH3 would produce S.

But I'm not certain.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is D: A is R, B is S.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves two reactions where a chemist uses two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, to reduce two unknown compounds (A and B) to produce enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one from A and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one from B. The task is to determine the correct starting materials A and B from the given options.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Product Structure**: The product is a six-membered cyclic ketone (pyran ring) with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. The stereochemistry at position 4 is R for reaction A and S for reaction B, indicating enantiomeric products.

2. **Reagents**:
   - **LiBH4**: A strong reducing agent typically used for reducing carbonyl groups (ketones and aldehydes) to alcohols. It adds hydrides to carbonyl carbons, and the stereochemistry of the product depends on the configuration of the starting material.
   - **BH3**: Typically used in hydroboration reactions, but in this context, it may reduce carbonyl groups differently than LiBH4, potentially leading to opposite stereochemical outcomes.

3. **Starting Material**:
   - The starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid derivatives with either (R) or (S) configurations. These compounds likely undergo reduction to form the cyclic ketone product.

4. **Stereochemical Considerations**:
   - The stereochemistry of the product (R or S) depends on the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent. If A and B are enantiomers, their reduction with different reagents (LiBH4 and BH3) could lead to enantiomeric products.

5. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Both A and B are (S)-configured. This would not produce enantiomeric products.
   - **Option B**: Both A and B are (R)-configured. This would also not produce enantiomeric products.
   - **Option C**: A is (S)-configured, and B is (R)-configured. This could produce enantiomeric products, but the stereochemical relationship between the starting materials and the reagents is unclear.
   - **Option D**: A is (R)-configured, and B is (S)-configured. This is consistent with the starting materials being enantiomers, and their reduction with different reagents (LiBH4 and BH3) could lead to the observed enantiomeric products.

### Conclusion:
Based on the stereochemical relationship between the starting materials and the products, the correct answer is **Option D**, where A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Answer: D
