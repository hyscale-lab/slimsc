Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the mean free path of gas molecules in a transmission electron microscope. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

So, the setup is that Mike is using a high-resolution TEM with an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, which is less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to have a vacuum so good that there are very few gas molecules, which helps with electron microscopy because fewer gas particles mean less scattering of the electrons, right?

But even after creating this ultra-high vacuum, some gas molecules are still present, as detected by a mass spectrometer. Mike calculates the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. Factors like pressure, temperature, and volume affect this.

Now, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices something interesting: the mean free path changes to λ2, which isn't the same as λ1. But the temperature in the compartment is the same, so that variable isn't changing. So why would the mean free path change?

Wait, I remember that the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the pressure (P) and the square root of the temperature (T), but directly proportional to the cross-sectional area (σ) of the molecules and the square root of the molar mass (M). Oh wait, or is it the other way around? Let me think. The formula I recall is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P), where d is the diameter of the molecules. Or sometimes it's written in terms of the number density, n. Because λ = 1/(√2 * n * σ), where σ is the collision cross-section. So as pressure increases, λ decreases, right?

Wait, but in this case, the pressure is the same before and after the electron beam is turned on, because the ultra-high vacuum was achieved and the temperature is the same. So why would λ change?

Ah, but wait. When the electron beam is on, maybe the gas molecules are being ionized or excited by the electrons. Oh, that's possible. Or perhaps the electrons are causing the gas molecules to heat up. But the question says temperature remains the same, so maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam affects the gas in another way. Such as causing the gas to become charged, or maybe the electron beam is so intense that it interacts with the gas molecules in a way that affects their movement.

Wait, another thought: Mean free path is calculated based on the assumption of ideal gas behavior. But if the electron beam is causing the molecules to be accelerated or perhaps even ionized, that could change the effective pressure or how they interact. Or perhaps the electron beam's electric fields influence the gas molecules, making them move more or less, thus changing the effective density.

Wait, but the pressure is the same. So if pressure is the same and temperature is the same, then λ should be the same. But Mike is observing a change. So maybe there's another factor at play here.

Oh, wait a minute. Let's think about the electron beam current. High-resolution TEMs can have very high electron currents, especially at high accelerating voltages like 1000 kV. The electrons are moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. If the gas molecules are hit by these electrons, each collision could impart a momentum change on the gas molecules. But wait, each gas molecule is very light, so even a small momentum transfer could significantly alter their velocity. But in the mean free path calculation, we're considering the average distance between collisions due to gas-gas interactions, not gas-electron interactions. So perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes additional scattering of the gas molecules, which wasn't accounted for in λ1.

Wait, but the mean free path λ1 was calculated based on gas-gas collisions. The electron beam is causing the gas molecules to interact with the electrons, which are part of the TEM's operation. So when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are being bombarded by electrons, which would cause more frequent collisions—wait, but in that case, the mean free path would decrease because the gas molecules are colliding more frequently with electrons (if that's considered in the model). Or wait, perhaps the electron beam adds more energy to the gas molecules, increasing their kinetic energy, thus increasing their speed and possibly the mean free path. Because λ is proportional to the speed (since speed is v = sqrt(3kT/m) and λ = v / (√2 π n σ)), so if v increases, λ increases.

But wait, in the scenario, the temperature remains the same. So if the temperature is the same, then the thermal velocity shouldn't change. Unless the electron beam is causing some other heating, but the question says temperature is same. So maybe another factor is at play.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to be ionized, making them charged. Charged particles would interact more strongly with each other, increasing the collision rate. Which would decrease the mean free path. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam causes the gas to become a plasma. In that case, the mean free path would be much shorter because the charged particles interact more.

But wait, the vacuum is ultra-high, so the gas density is very low. So the ionization might not be significant unless the electron flux is extremely high.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to be deflected, but that wouldn't directly affect the mean free path between gas-gas collisions, unless the beam is causing some pumping effect.

Wait, but the problem states that the gas remains. So the presence of the electron beam isn't removing the gas, but perhaps altering the way the gas molecules move.

Hmm... Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path calculation (λ1) was based on the assumption of elastic collisions. But when the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are being accelerated by the beam, leading to inelastic collisions or different collision dynamics.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam is causing the gas to expand or change its state, but the question says the temperature is the same, so that's unlikely.

Wait, but the mean free path is determined by the probability of collisions between gas molecules. If the electron beam isn't causing that to change, then the mean free path should stay about the same. But Mike observes it's changed. So maybe the initial calculation (λ1) was based on the assumption that the gas is stationary, but in reality, when the electron beam is on, the gas is moving.

Wait, no. The gas is in the vacuum chamber; the electron beam is passing through it. So the gas molecules are stationary relative to the beam. So their velocities relative to each other would stay the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas to be excited, increasing the vibrational modes, but that might not affect the mean free path if temperature is the same.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again about the factors affecting the mean free path.

The formula for mean free path is λ = 1/(√2 n σ), where n is the number density of gas molecules, and σ is the collision cross-section.

n is given by P/(kT) * (molar mass)/(k), wait, no. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. So number density n = P/(kT) * (N_A M) / (V), but perhaps I'm mixing units.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the ideal gas law. n is the number of molecules per unit volume. P = nkT, so n = P/(kT). So if P and T are the same, then n is same, so λ should be same.

But in this case, when Mike starts the electron beam, the pressure P is the same, so n is same. So why would λ change?

Ah! Wait, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to have more energy, but not in the thermal sense. Because the electron beam may be adding energy to the gas via inelastic collisions, but the temperature as measured is the same. So maybe the gas is in a different state where the mean free path isn't just determined by thermal motion.

But wait, in that case, the temperature is same, so thermal speed is same. So why would the mean free path change?

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas to become a plasma, leading to different collision dynamics, but in ultra-high vacuum, it's hard to form a plasma because the density is too low.

Wait, another angle: the mean free path is the average distance a gas molecule travels between collisions. In the presence of the electron beam, perhaps the gas molecules are more likely to interact with the electrons, which are part of the beam, than with each other. But in that case, collisions between gas and electrons (if any) would be a separate effect. 

But in the mean free path calculation, we usually consider gas-gas collisions. So if the electron beam causes additional scattering (gas-electron collisions), that would introduce another factor into the mean free path.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the mean free path λ1 is calculated based only on gas-gas collisions. If so, then the presence of the electron beam might cause gas-electron interactions, which aren't accounted for in λ1. So when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might have a higher chance of colliding with electrons than with each other, thus changing their effective mean free path.

Wait, but in the scenario, the mean free path λ2 is what Mike observes based on electron scattering. So perhaps the mean free path of the electrons is being considered, not the gas molecules. Or wait, the question says he observed a change in the mean free path 'based on electron scattering with the gas molecules.' Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, the question says: upon initiating the electron beam, he found that the mean free path was no longer λ1, but λ2. But he observed this based on electron scattering with the gas molecules.

Wait, so perhaps the mean free path λ refers to that of the electrons, not the gas molecules. Oh, that's a different perspective. So, the mean free path of the electrons (λ_e) is the distance they travel before scattering off a gas molecule. 

In that case, the initial calculation (λ1) was for the gas molecules' mean free path. But when the electron beam starts, we're looking at the electron's mean free path, λ_e.

Wait, but that complicates things. Let me re-read the question.

"Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (<10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature."

So he calculated λ1 for the gas molecules, not the electrons.

"However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules."

Ah, so he's now measuring the mean free path of the electrons (λ_e) as they scatter off the gas molecules. So when the electron beam is on, the electrons are passing through the gas, and their path is scattered by the gas molecules. So the mean free path for the electrons would be the average distance between electron-gas molecule collisions.

So, initially, when the electron beam is off, Mike had calculated the gas's mean free path λ1. But when the beam is on, he observes the electron's mean free path, λ2.

So the question is: How does λ2 compare to λ1?

Wait, but the initial calculation of λ1 is for the gas molecules, and the second scenario is about the electrons' mean free path.

So, the mean free path of the gas molecules is λ1, but the mean free path of the electrons is λ2, which would be different.

But the question is a bit ambiguous because it says Mike found that the mean free path was no longer λ1, but λ2. Hmm, perhaps I should re-read the question.

Question: "he found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same."

Wait, so the mean free path λ is for the gas molecules, but under electron beam, it changes. Or is it for the electrons? The wording is a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path of the electrons is being measured via their scattering. So, when the electron beam is on, the electrons are scattered by the gas, and their mean free path is λ2. But in the initial state, when the beam was off, the mean free path of the gas molecules was λ1.

But the question says that when the electron beam is turned on, the mean free path (of the gas molecules) is λ2, different from λ1. That seems confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps Mike was observing the electron beam's effective path through the gas, which depends on the gas density and the electron's interaction with the gas. So the mean free path for the electrons would be λ2, and the mean free path for the gas molecules is λ1.

Wait, but the question says that the mean free path as observed changed from λ1 to λ2. So perhaps the mean free path is that of the gas molecules, but under the influence of the electron beam, it changes.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let's think again.

The mean free path of the gas molecules, λ1, was determined under the ultra-high vacuum conditions. When the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas is being heated or ionized, which affects the mean free path.

But in the question, the temperature remains same, so thermal expansion isn't an issue. However, if the gas becomes ionized, the mean free path would change because ionized particles might interact differently.

Wait, but the mean free path of the gas molecules is determined by their collisions with each other. If the presence of the electron beam doesn't affect their mutual collisions, then λ1 should remain λ1. But if the gas becomes charged, perhaps the cross-section for collisions changes. For example, if the gas molecules are positively or negatively charged, their cross-section σ might increase, leading to a shorter mean free path.

But wait, in an ultra-high vacuum, the pressure is so low that the gas density is very low, so the mean free path is very long. But with the electron beam on, perhaps the gas is ionized, leading to a plasma. In a plasma, the mean free path can be much shorter because charged particles interact more strongly.

So if the gas becomes ionized, the mean free path λ2 would be shorter than λ1. Because the collision cross-section increases when the gas is ionized, as charged particles are more likely to interact.

So λ2 < λ1.

Looking at the options:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 → λ2 is bigger, which would be if the mean free path increased.

B) λ2 = λ1 → same, which Mike's observation says no.

C) λ2 < λ1 → which fits our reasoning.

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 → λ2 is bigger, but not by much.

So the correct answer would be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To analyze the situation, we consider the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in an ultra-high vacuum chamber under two conditions: when the electron beam is off and when it is on. Initially, Mike calculates the mean free path of the gas molecules as λ1, based on the ultra-high vacuum conditions, where the pressure (P) and temperature (T) are constant. The mean free path is determined by the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \, n \, \sigma}
\]

where \(n\) is the number density of gas molecules, and \(\sigma\) is the collision cross-section. Since \(n\) depends on \(P\) and \(T\), and both are constant, λ1 remains fixed.

When the electron beam is initiated, Mike observes a change in the mean free path to λ2. This observation must be interpreted carefully. The question implies that the mean free path being measured is still that of the gas molecules, but the electron beam introduces additional effects. Specifically, the electron beam can ionize the gas molecules, creating a plasma. In this state, the collision dynamics change because charged particles interact more strongly, increasing the effective collision cross-section (\(\sigma\)). As a result, the mean free path of the gas molecules decreases, leading to λ2 < λ1.

The other options can be ruled out as follows:
- **Option A (λ2 ≥ 1.22λ1):** This would imply the mean free path increases, which contradicts the scenario where ionization reduces the mean free path.
- **Option B (λ2 = λ1):** This would suggest no change in the mean free path, which contradicts Mike's observation of a change to λ2.
- **Option D (λ1 < λ2 < 1.22λ1):** This implies an increase in the mean free path, which is inconsistent with the ionization effect.

Thus, the correct conclusion is that λ2 < λ1 due to the increased collision cross-section caused by ionization of the gas molecules when the electron beam is on.
