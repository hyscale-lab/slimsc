Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle decays, energy and momentum are conserved. The question is asking for the kinetic energies of the product particles, the muon and the neutrino. 

The given data is that the pion Pi(+) is stationary and its rest mass is 139.6 MeV. The muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. Since the neutrino is almost massless, I think I can approximate its rest mass as zero, which should simplify things.

Wait, so the decay equation is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. Okay, so the pion is at rest initially, which means the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the decay products must also be zero. That means the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. 

Since the neutrino is massless, its energy would be equal to its momentum times c (but since we’re working in units where c=1, E = p). The muon, on the other hand, has rest mass, so its energy will be the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. 

Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that in such decay problems, the energies can be found using conservation of energy and momentum. Let's denote the following:

- Let m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c² (but since we're using units where c=1, just 139.6 MeV)
- m_mu = 105.7 MeV
- m_nu = 0

The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion: E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's energy and the neutrino's energy: E_mu + E_nu.

Since energy is conserved, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

Also, the total momentum before decay is zero, so the momenta after must cancel each other. So p_mu = -p_nu. But because neutrino is massless, E_nu = |p_nu|. Similarly, the muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ), but again, with c=1, it's sqrt( p_mu² + m_mu² ).

Hmm, but since the momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, let me denote p_mu = p and p_nu = p (but direction is opposite). Wait, no. Wait, because the pion is at rest, the total momentum is zero. So muon's momentum plus neutrino's momentum equals zero. So p_mu = -p_nu.

But since neutrino's momentum is p_nu, and muon's is p_mu, and p_mu + p_nu = 0, so p_mu = -p_nu. But in magnitude, |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

Wait, but because the neutrino is massless, its energy E_nu equals its momentum (since E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2, and m=0). So E_nu = p. Similarly, the muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2).

So substituting into energy conservation: E_mu + E_nu = m_pi.

So, sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi.

Let me write that equation again: sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = m_pi.

I can solve for p. Let me rearrange it.

sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = m_pi - p.

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

p² + m_mu² = (m_pi - p)^2.

Expanding the right side: m_pi² - 2 m_pi p + p².

Subtract p² from both sides:

m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p.

Rearranging:

2 m_pi p = m_pi² - m_mu².

So,

p = [ m_pi² - m_mu² ] / (2 m_pi )

Let me plug in the numbers.

m_pi = 139.6 MeV, m_mu = 105.7 MeV.

m_pi squared is (139.6)^2.

Let me calculate that. 139.6^2 is approximately (140)^2 = 19600, but precise calculation:

139.6 * 139.6. Let's compute:

139.6 * 139.6 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

Similarly, m_mu squared is (105.7)^2. Let's compute that.

105.7^2 = (100 +5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 + 5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49.

So,

m_pi squared - m_mu squared = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 MeV².

Then,

p = 8315.67 / (2 * 139.6) 

Compute denominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So, 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let me compute.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2. Let's approximate.

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30 = 8376 → 29 would be 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8? Wait, wait, perhaps I should do it differently.

Wait, 279.2 * x = 8315.67.

Let me compute x = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1000: 8.31567 / 0.2792 ≈ Let's compute 8.31567 / 0.2792.

Hmm, approximately 8.315 / 0.279 ≈ 30 (since 0.279 *30=8.37, which is a bit higher than 8.315. So perhaps around 29.8 or so.)

Wait, exact calculation: 0.2792 * 29.8 = ?

0.2792 *30 = 8.376, so 0.2792 *29.8 = 8.376 - 0.2792 *0.2 = 8.376 - 0.05584 = 8.32016.

Which is very close to 8.31567. So x ≈ 29.8.

So, p ≈ 29.8 MeV/c (since p = energy unit, but in units where c=1, p has units of MeV/c or MeV, perhaps? Wait, in units where c=1, E and p have the same units. So p is about 29.8 MeV/c.

So E_nu = p = 29.8 MeV.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Because E_nu = p, since the neutrino is massless. So the neutrino's energy is 29.8 MeV.

Now, the muon's energy E_mu is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). p is 29.8 MeV/c, but again, in units where c=1, p is 29.8 MeV.

So, E_mu = sqrt( (29.8)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.8 squared: approximately 888.04.

105.7 squared is 11172.49, as before.

So, sum is 888.04 + 11172.49 = 12060.53.

E_mu = sqrt(12060.53) ≈ 109.8 MeV.

Wait, because sqrt(12060.53) is around 109.8 MeV because 110^2 is 12100, which is a bit higher. So 109.8^2= (approx) 12056.04, close to 12060.53. So E_mu ≈ 109.8 MeV.

But wait, let me check:

109.8^2 = (110 - 0.2)^2 = 110² - 2*110*0.2 + 0.2² = 12100 -44 + 0.04 = 12056.04.

Our E_mu^2 is 12060.53, which is 4.49 higher. So 109.8^2 =12056.04, so 109.8 + delta)^2 =12060.53.

(109.8 + d)^2 = 109.8^2 + 2*109.8*d + d^2 ≈ 12056.04 + 219.6 d = 12060.53

So 219.6 d ≈ 4.49 → d ≈4.49/219.6≈ 0.0204.

So E_mu ≈109.8 +0.0204 ≈109.82 MeV.

So E_mu ≈109.82 MeV.

Now, the muon's rest mass energy is 105.7 MeV. So its kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu c² = 109.82 -105.7 ≈4.12 MeV.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the neutrino's energy is 29.8 MeV, and the muon's energy is about 109.8 MeV. But the total of those is 109.8 +29.8 =139.6 MeV, which matches the pion's rest energy, so that's correct.

But the question is about the kinetic energies of the product particles. So the muon's KE is 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is its energy since it's massless (its rest energy is zero, so all energy is kinetic. So neutrino's KE is 29.8 MeV? Or wait, no. Because the neutrino is massless, its energy is all kinetic. So yes, its KE is 29.8 MeV.

Wait, but the options don't have 4.12 and 29.8. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV

B) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV

C) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV

D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV

Ah, option D has 4.12 and 29.8. So that matches.

Wait, but I thought the neutrino's energy is 29.8 MeV, which is its kinetic energy. So the KE of the muon is 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is 29.8 MeV. So option D is correct.

Alternatively, I should double-check the calculations. Let me re-calculate p.

p = [ (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 ] / (2 *139.6 )

Compute numerator: (139.6)^2 =19488.16; (105.7)^2=11172.49.

Subtract: 19488.16 -11172.49 =8315.67.

Denominator: 2 *139.6=279.2.

So p=8315.67 / 279.2 ≈29.8 MeV/c. Correct.

E_mu= sqrt( (29.8)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) = sqrt(888.04 + 11172.49)= sqrt(12060.53)= approx 109.82 MeV.

So muon's KE=109.82 -105.7=4.12 MeV.

Neutrino's KE is 29.8 MeV.

So the answer should be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary pion \( \pi^+ \) into a muon \( \mu^+ \) and a neutrino \( \nu \). The rest masses are given as \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \), while the neutrino is massless (\( m_\nu = 0 \)).

### Key Conservation Laws:
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before and after the decay must be conserved. Initially, the pion is stationary, so its total energy is its rest energy:  
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's energy \( E_{\mu^+} \) and the neutrino's energy \( E_\nu \):  
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu = m_{\pi^+}.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**: The pion is stationary, so the total momentum before the decay is zero. After the decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta:  
   \[
   \vec{p}_{\mu^+} = -\vec{p}_\nu.
   \]  
   Since the neutrino is massless, its energy equals its momentum (\( E_\nu = p_\nu \)).

### Solving for Energies:
Using the above conservation laws, we denote the magnitude of the muon's momentum as \( p \). The neutrino's momentum is also \( p \) (equal and opposite to the muon's). The muon's energy is given by:  
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
\]  
The neutrino's energy is:  
\[
E_\nu = p.
\]  

From energy conservation:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p = m_{\pi^+}.
\]  
Rearranging and squaring both sides:  
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 = (m_{\pi^+} - p)^2.
\]  
Expanding and simplifying:  
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 = m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2m_{\pi^+}p + p^2.
\]  
Canceling \( p^2 \):  
\[
m_{\mu^+}^2 = m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2m_{\pi^+}p.
\]  
Solving for \( p \):  
\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2}{2m_{\pi^+}}.
\]  

Substituting the given values:  
\[
m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}, \quad m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
\[
p = \frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \cdot 139.6}.
\]  
First, calculate \( m_{\pi^+}^2 \) and \( m_{\mu^+}^2 \):  
\[
m_{\pi^+}^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \, \text{MeV}^2, \quad m_{\mu^+}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2.
\]  
\[
m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 \, \text{MeV}^2.
\]  
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{2 \cdot 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  

Now, calculate the muon's energy:  
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = \sqrt{(29.8)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]  
\[
(29.8)^2 = 888.04, \quad (105.7)^2 = 11172.49.
\]  
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{888.04 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12060.53} \approx 109.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  

The muon's kinetic energy is:  
\[
KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  

The neutrino's kinetic energy is equal to its energy since it is massless:  
\[
KE_\nu = E_\nu = p = 29.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \), respectively. This matches option D.
