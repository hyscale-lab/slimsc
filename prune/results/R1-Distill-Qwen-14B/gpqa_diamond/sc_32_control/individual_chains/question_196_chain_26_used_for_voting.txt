Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a particle in a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The given parameters are mass m, maximum amplitude A, and it's obeying Hooke's law F = -kx. The speed of light is c, which suggests that relativity comes into play here.

In the non-relativistic case, I remember that the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², so setting that equal to (1/2)mv_max² gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which matches option C. But wait, this is the relativistic case, so option C is probably incorrect because relativity would change things when speeds get close to c.

So how does relativity affect this? Well, in special relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Instead, the total energy includes relativistic effects. The total energy E is given by gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). And the kinetic energy is E - mc².

In the harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy would still be the sum of kinetic and potential at any point. But at maximum displacement (amplitude A), the particle comes to rest momentarily. Wait, no, in the non-relativistic case, yes, but relativistically, maybe not. Or wait, maybe in the relativistic case, the potential energy would need to account for relativistic effects as well. Wait, but the potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is still (1/2)kx², right? Hmm, maybe the force is still F = -kx, so the potential is (1/2)kx² as in the non-relativistic case.

Wait, but wait. The problem states it's a relativistic oscillator, but the force is given by F = -kx. Hmm, that's interesting. Normally, in relativistic mechanics, the equations can get more complicated because the relations between force, acceleration, and velocity change. However, maybe in this problem, the potential energy is still (1/2)kA², but the total energy is different because of relativity.

So, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when all potential energy is converted into kinetic. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². So the total energy would be E = K + U = (gamma -1)mc² + (1/2)kA². But wait, in the non-relativistic case, E is (1/2)kA², but in relativity, the total energy might be higher because of the rest mass energy.

Wait, no. At maximum displacement A, the velocity is zero in the non-relativistic case, so all energy is potential. But in the relativistic case, perhaps the velocity isn't zero? That doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the oscillator still turns around at maximum displacement, so at that point, the velocity is zero. So the potential energy is maximum, and kinetic is zero. So the total energy is just the potential energy, which is (1/2)kA².

But wait, that doesn't seem right. Because in relativity, the total energy includes rest mass energy. So maybe the total energy is (1/2)kA² plus the rest energy mc². Hmm, but that depends on the setup. I think in the harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) should equal the rest energy plus any other forms of energy. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait another approach: for a relativistic harmonic oscillator, how is the energy expressed? The total energy E is gamma * mc², and at maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so gamma is 1, so E = mc². But that can't be because the potential energy is (1/2)kA², which would have to equal E. So (1/2)kA² = mc², which would fix A in terms of m, k, and c. But that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is equal to the rest mass energy plus the potential energy at maximum amplitude. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. In the non-relativistic case, the total energy is (1/2)kA², which equals the maximum kinetic energy. But in the relativistic case, the total energy is higher.

Wait, perhaps the total energy is the sum of rest energy and the potential energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA². Then, when the oscillator is at the equilibrium position (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So the kinetic energy at that point would be E - mc², which is (1/2)kA². But wait, no, because when x is zero, potential energy is zero. So the kinetic energy should be E - U. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy (which is conserved) is the sum of the rest energy, kinetic, and potential. But that seems unlikely because usually, the rest energy is considered separately.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach. Let's consider energy conservation. At maximum amplitude (x = A), the velocity v is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. The potential energy is (1/2)kA². So the total energy E is (1/2)kA².

When the oscillator is at the equilibrium point (x=0), the velocity is maximum, v_max. The potential energy is zero, so the kinetic energy is E, which is (1/2)kA². But wait, in this case, that would lead to (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA², which is the non-relativistic result. But since it's a relativistic problem, this can't be correct.

Ah, right, because in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv². So the kinetic energy at maximum speed is (gamma -1) mc². And the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So the total energy E is (gamma -1) mc² + (1/2)kA². But at x=A, the velocity is zero, so gamma is 1, and the kinetic energy is zero. So E equals (1/2)kA².

Wait, but when the oscillator is at x=0, the velocity is maximum. So the total energy is gamma*mc², because potential is zero. So E = gamma*mc² = (1/2)kA² + (gamma -1) mc²? Wait, that seems confusing.

Wait, let's clarify. The total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy when potential energy is zero. So when the oscillator is at x=0, the potential energy is zero, so E = (gamma -1) mc² + (1/2)mv²? No, wait, no. Wait, (gamma -1) mc² is the kinetic energy.

Wait, another approach: the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is conserved, but in this case, the rest mass energy is separate. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for a relation between the maximum speed and the parameters.

Wait, perhaps I can write the energy conservation equation. The total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At the equilibrium point, x=0, the potential energy is zero. So the total energy is just the kinetic energy, which is (gamma -1) mc². So:

E = (gamma -1) mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, that would give (gamma -1) mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply gamma is greater than 2, which would require v greater than c. Which is impossible. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the rest energy is included in the potential energy? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should consider that the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential, and that when x=A, the kinetic is zero. So at x=A, E = (1/2)kA². But wait, the rest energy is mc², which is part of the total energy. So maybe E = (1/2)kA² + mc².

That would make sense because the total energy includes both the rest mass energy and the potential energy. Because at x=A, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Then, at the equilibrium point (x=0), the potential energy is zero. The total energy is then the kinetic energy, which is (gamma -1) mc². So,

(gamma -1) mc² = E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Subtract mc² from both sides:

(gamma -1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

Divide both sides by mc²:

gamma -1 = (k A²)/(2 mc²).

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 mc²).

Let me rewrite that. Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 mc^2) as a variable, say, alpha.

So,

gamma = 1 + alpha.

But alpha can be written as (k A²)/(2 mc²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v_max^2/c^2)) = 1 + alpha.

Hmm, let's solve for v_max. Let's denote beta = v_max/c. So,

1/sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1 + alpha.

Square both sides:

1/(1 - beta²) = (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

1 - beta² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Rearranged,

beta² = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2 ].

Hmm, let me compute 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2 ]

= [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2

= [ 1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2 -1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2

= [ 2 alpha + alpha^2 ] / (1 + alpha)^2

Approximate for small alpha? Wait, but I don't know if alpha is small. Alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²). So if k A² is much less than m c², then alpha is small, and we can approximate. But the problem doesn't specify that it's a weakly relativistic case. So I think I can't make approximations, I have to keep it exact.

So,

beta^2 = (2 alpha + alpha^2) / (1 + alpha)^2.

But alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So,

beta^2 = [ 2*(k A^2/(2 m c²)) + (k A^2/(2 m c²))^2 ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c²)))^2

Simplify numerator:

2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) = (k A²) / (m c² )

So,

beta^2 = [ (k A²)/(m c²) + (k A^2)^2/(4 m² c^4) ] / [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ]

Hmm, that's getting complicated. Maybe I can factor out (k A^2/(2 m c²))^2 somewhere.

Wait, let me factor (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) from the numerator and denominator.

Let me write denominator:

(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A^2)/(2 m c²) ) ]^2.

So,

beta^2 = [ (k A^2/(m c²)) + (k A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ] / [ (2 m c² + k A^2)^2/(4 m² c^4) ) ]

Hmm, perhaps this approach is getting too messy. Let me try a different way.

Wait, earlier I had:

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

So,

gamma = 1 + alpha.

And,

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1 + alpha.

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - beta²) = (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

1 - beta² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Rearranged,

beta^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Which is,

beta^2 = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2) -1 = 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So,

beta^2 = (2 alpha + alpha^2) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Which factors as:

beta^2 = alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

beta^2 = alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Wait, but maybe there's another way to express this. Let's see.

Let me factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: alpha (2 + alpha) = alpha (alpha +2 )

Denominator: (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can write it as:

beta^2 = [ alpha (alpha + 2) ] / (alpha + 1)^2.

Alternatively,

beta^2 = [ alpha (alpha + 2) ] / (alpha + 1)^2.

Wait, perhaps I can split this fraction.

Wait, perhaps I can write numerator as (alpha + 2) alpha = (alpha +1 +1) alpha = alpha (alpha +1) + alpha.

So,

beta^2 = [ (alpha (alpha +1) ) + alpha ] / (alpha +1)^2.

Which is,

beta^2 = [ alpha (alpha +1) ) / (alpha +1)^2 ) ] + [ alpha / (alpha +1)^2 ) ]

Simplify: first term is alpha/(alpha+1), second term is alpha/(alpha+1)^2.

So,

beta^2 = [ alpha/(alpha+1) ] + [ alpha/(alpha +1)^2 ].

But I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe it's better to just proceed with substitution.

So, beta^2 = [ 2 alpha + alpha² ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

But alpha = (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So,

beta^2 = [ 2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))^2 ] / [ (1 + k A^2/(2 m c^2) )^2 ]

Simplify numerator:

2 * [k A^2/(2 m c^2)] = k A^2/(m c^2).

So,

beta^2 = [ k A^2/(m c^2) + (k A^2)^2/(4 m² c^4) ) ] / [ ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ]

Wait, denominator:

(1 + alpha)^2 = [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) ) ]^2.

So,

denominator = (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 / (4 m² c^4 )

Putting it all together,

beta^2 = [ (k A^2/(m c^2) ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ] * [4 m² c^4 / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ]

Factor numerator inside the brackets:

k A^2/(m c^2) ) = k A^2 (4 m c^2 ) / (4 m² c^4 )

Wait, perhaps I can factor the numerator as:

[k A^2 (4 m c^2) + k^2 A^4 ] / (4 m² c^4 )

Wait, let me compute the numerator:

Numerator inside the first bracket:

k A^2/(m c^2) + (k A^2)^2/(4 m^2 c^4 )

= [4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 ] / (4 m^2 c^4 )

So,

beta^2 = [ (4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 ) / (4 m² c^4 ) ) ] * [4 m² c^4 / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ]

Simplify the fractions:

The (4 m² c^4 ) in denominator and numerator cancel.

So, beta^2 = [4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 ] / (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2.

Factor numerator:

4 m c² k A^2 + k^2 A^4 = k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2 )

Denominator: (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2.

So,

beta^2 = [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ]

Hmm, perhaps factor 4 m c^2 as 2*(2 m c^2). Let me see.

Wait, 4 m c^2 + k A^2 = (2 m c^2)*2 + k A^2. Doesn't seem to factor nicely. Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of denominator.

Wait, the denominator is (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

So,

beta^2 = [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, perhaps write numerator as k A^2 * [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ].

Wait, 4 m c^2 = 2*(2 m c^2).

So,

4 m c^2 + k A^2 = 2 m c^2 + (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) = that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps factor numerator as k A^2 [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ].

But that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the numerator as:

k A^2 [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ].

Which is,

k A^2 (2 m c^2 + k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) = k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ).

So that's going back to where I started.

Wait, perhaps I can write beta^2 as [ (k A^2) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2) ] * [ (4 m c^2 + k A^2) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2) ) ].

So,

beta^2 = [ (k A^2) (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2)^2.

Hmm, that's an expression, but I'm not sure how to simplify it further.

Wait, perhaps think about the options given. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - k A²/(2 m ))^2 ) * c.

Hmm, not sure.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - k A²/(2 m c²) ) ) * c.

Option C: sqrt(k A^2 / m ), which is non-relativistic.

Option D: sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + k A²/(2 m c² ))^2 ) * c.

Wait, from earlier, I had:

beta^2 = [2 alpha + alpha^2 ] / (1 + alpha )^2, where alpha = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

beta^2 = [ 2 * (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ] / (1 + k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

Which simplifies to:

beta^2 = [ (k A^2 )/(m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4 )/(4 m^2 c^4 ) ] / ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) )^2.

Wait, but this seems a bit messy. Let me think about the expression for beta^2.

Wait, from earlier:

beta^2 = (2 alpha + alpha^2) / (1 + alpha )^2.

So,

beta^2 = alpha (2 + alpha ) / (1 + alpha )^2.

Which can be written as:

beta^2 = [ alpha (2 + alpha ) ] / (1 + alpha )^2.

Let me compute 2 + alpha = 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² ) = (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )/( 2 m c^2 )

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write beta as v_max/c.

Wait, the options all have sqrt expressions. Let me look for expressions in terms of beta.

Wait, let's think about the options. For example, option B is c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2 )/(2 m c² )) )

Wait, that would be c * sqrt( [ (1 - (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )) + 1 ] / [ (1 - (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )) ] )

Which simplifies to c * sqrt( [ 2 - (k A^2 )/(2 m c² ) ] / [ 1 - (k A^2 )/(2 m c² ) ] )

Hmm, not sure.

Option A: c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m ) )^2 )

But (k A^2)/(2m ) is a quantity without c, which seems odd because dimensions would be (force * length^2)/(mass), which is (mass * length/time^2 ) * length^2 ) / mass ) → length^3/time^2 → not dimensionless. So that can't be correct, because the expression inside the sqrt must be dimensionless.

Wait, (k A^2 )/(2 m c² ) is dimensionless. Because k has dimensions of force/length → mass/time². So (mass/time²) * length² → mass * length²/time² = mass*(length/time)^2 → (kg * (m/s)^2 ) = kg m²/s² → same as Joules. So (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) has units of (Joules)/(Joules) → dimensionless.

So, the terms in alpha must be dimensionless, which makes sense.

So, looking back at the options, options A, B, D have (k A^2 )/( 2 m c² ) or similar terms.

So, to find which option matches beta = v_max/c = sqrt( [2 alpha + alpha^2 ] / (1 + alpha )^2 )

Hmm, perhaps I can rearrange this expression.

Let me take the reciprocal:

1/beta^2 = (1 + alpha )^2 / (2 alpha + alpha^2 )

= [ (1 + alpha )^2 ] / [ alpha (2 + alpha ) ]

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of gamma terms.

Wait, earlier I had gamma = 1 + alpha.

And,

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2 )

So,

1 - beta^2 = 1/ gamma² = 1/(1 + alpha )^2.

So,

beta^2 = 1 - [ 1/(1 + alpha )^2 ]

Which can be written as beta^2 = [ (1 + alpha )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha )^2.

Which we already did earlier.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me compute 1 - beta^2:

1 - beta^2 = [ (1 + alpha )^2 - (2 alpha + alpha^2 ) ] / (1 + alpha )^2.

Wait, let me compute numerator:

(1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2 ) - (2 alpha + alpha^2 ) = 1.

So,

1 - beta^2 = 1/(1 + alpha )^2.

Which is consistent with what we had before.

Hmm, perhaps I can find an expression for v_max in terms of gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express beta in terms of gamma.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should look for an expression that matches one of the options.

Wait, another approach: The correct expression for beta is given by (2 alpha + alpha^2 ) / (1 + alpha )^2.

Let me compute (2 alpha + alpha^2 ) / (1 + alpha )^2.

= alpha (2 + alpha ) / (1 + alpha )^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this as alpha/(1 + alpha ) * (2 + alpha )/(1 + alpha )

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as [ alpha / (1 + alpha ) ] * [ (2 + alpha ) / (1 + alpha ) ]

Hmm. Alternatively, think of (2 + alpha ) = (1 + alpha ) + 1.

So,

= [ alpha ( (1 + alpha ) + 1 ) ] / (1 + alpha )^2

= [ alpha (1 + alpha ) + alpha ] / (1 + alpha )^2.

= [ alpha (1 + alpha ) ]/(1 + alpha )^2 + alpha/(1 + alpha )^2.

= alpha/(1 + alpha ) + alpha/(1 + alpha )^2.

Hmm, but I don't see an obvious simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expression numerically for a simple case to see which of the options gives the right result.

Let me take a simple case where (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) is zero. That would imply alpha = 0.

In that case, beta^2 = 0 → v_max =0. That would be a problem, because when k=0, the oscillator wouldn't oscillate.

Wait, no, wait. If k is zero, then the potential energy is zero, and the system would be free. But in that case, the maximum speed would be c? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should pick a different test case where alpha is small, so we can use a Taylor expansion.

Suppose alpha is very small, so (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) << 1.

So, alpha << 1.

Then, beta^2 ≈ [ 2 alpha + alpha^2 ] / (1 + 2 alpha ).

But since alpha is small, alpha^2 is negligible compared to 2 alpha.

So,

beta^2 ≈ (2 alpha )/(1 + 2 alpha ) ≈ 2 alpha (1 - 2 alpha ) → approximately 2 alpha - 4 alpha^2.

But since alpha is small, 4 alpha^2 is negligible.

So,

beta^2 ≈ 2 alpha.

So,

beta ≈ sqrt(2 alpha ) = sqrt( 2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) = sqrt( k A^2/( m c^2 ) ) = (A sqrt(k/m )) / c.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is sqrt(k A^2/m ) = A sqrt(k/m ), so v_max = A sqrt(k/m ). In the relativistic case when alpha is small, v_max ≈ sqrt( k A^2/(m c^2 ) ) * c = (A sqrt(k/m )) / c * c = A sqrt(k/m ), which matches the non-relativistic result. So the correct expression should reduce correctly in this limit.

Looking at the options, option C gives v_max = sqrt( k A^2/m ), which is correct in the non-relativistic case, but since the problem is relativistic, option C is probably not the correct answer. But wait, when alpha is small, all options except C might be approximated to match the non-relativistic case.

Wait, considering that in the small alpha limit, the correct expression for beta is sqrt(2 alpha ), which is about sqrt( 2*(k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) = sqrt( k A^2/( m c^2 ) ) → v_max = c * sqrt( k A^2/( m c^2 ) ) = sqrt( k A^2/m ), which matches option C.

Hmm, but option C is the non-relativistic case, but the correct relativistic expression must approach this in the limit. So the correct option must approach option C when alpha is small.

Looking at the options:

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2 )/(2 m ) )^2 )

Wait, but with units, this doesn't make sense because the denominator would have units of 1/time², so the entire expression inside the sqrt would be dimensionless plus something else. So probably incorrect.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )) )

Which, when alpha is small, because (k A^2 )/(2 m c² ) is small, 1/(1 - alpha ) ≈ 1 + alpha. So,

1 + 1/(1 - alpha ) ≈ 1 + 1 + alpha = 2 + alpha.

But when alpha is small, this is approx 2. So sqrt(2 ) * c. But in the non-relativistic case, v_max would be sqrt(k A^2/m ), which is much less than c. So this can't be right.

Option D: sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

When alpha is small, denominator is 1 + alpha, so 1/(1 + alpha )^2 ≈ 1 - 2 alpha.

So,

1 - [1 - 2 alpha ] = 2 alpha.

So,

sqrt(2 alpha ) → which is correct for the small alpha limit.

So option D gives the correct behavior for small alpha.

Wait, but wait. Let's compute option D's expression.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

So,

1 - 1/(1 + alpha )^2 = [ (1 + alpha )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha )^2 = [ 2 alpha + alpha^2 ] / (1 + alpha )^2.

Which is exactly what we have for beta^2. So,

beta = sqrt( [2 alpha + alpha^2 ] / (1 + alpha )^2 )

Which is the same as option D, because option D is:

c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + alpha )^2 )

Which is,

c * sqrt( [ (1 + alpha )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha )^2 )

= c * sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha^2 ) / (1 + alpha )^2 )

Which is exactly v_max/c.

So, option D is beta = v_max/c, so v_max = c * sqrt( [2 alpha + alpha^2 ] / (1 + alpha )^2 )

Which is correct. So the correct option is D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the energy conservation and relativistic corrections.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is conserved. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the velocity is zero, and the total energy is purely potential:  
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]  
   At equilibrium \( x = 0 \), the velocity is maximum, and the total energy is purely kinetic. In relativistic mechanics, the kinetic energy is given by:  
   \[
   K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Thus, the total energy at equilibrium is:  
   \[
   E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
   \]  
   Equating the two expressions for \( E \):  
   \[
   (\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]  
   Solving for \( \gamma \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]

2. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:  
   The relativistic factor \( \gamma \) is related to the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) by:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]  
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2.
   \]  
   Rearranging for \( v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 \):  
   \[
   1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \) with the given options, we find that it matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is consistent with the relativistic energy conservation and reduces to the non-relativistic result \( v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \) in the limit \( \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \ll 1 \).
