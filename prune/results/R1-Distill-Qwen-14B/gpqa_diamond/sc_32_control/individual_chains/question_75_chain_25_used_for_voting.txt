Okay, so I need to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the mouse model. Let's start by looking at the problem. The researcher introduced a sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigenic determinant at the N-terminus of the GADD45G coding sequence. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with this plasmid and are having trouble getting the protein expressed.

Hmm, looking at the DNA sequence provided, I should probably check if it's correctly set up for translation. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. That's good. Then, I see the HA tag would be at the N-terminus. The HA sequence is generally added as a peptide tag, so maybe the construct includes the HA sequence before the GADD45G coding starts.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the structure. The HA tag is added to the N-terminus, so in the DNA, that would mean the HA coding sequence is before the GADD45G start. Looking at the provided DNA, the starting ATG is at the very beginning, so perhaps the HA is not correctly inserted. Or maybe there's an issue with the reading frame.

Wait, the HA determinant is a specific sequence. Maybe the way it's inserted messed up the reading frame. Let me think: the HA tag is usually a short peptide, maybe around 11 amino acids. The DNA sequence for HA would be something like ATG... etc. But wait, in the given construct, does the HA sequence actually exist?

Wait, looking at the given DNA sequence, the very first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC... So the first codon is ATG (start), then TAC is Tyr, then CCA is Pro, TAC is Tyr again, GAT is Asp, GTA is Val, TCC is Ser, etc. So that's the HA sequence? Or no? Wait, maybe the HA sequence was inserted, but perhaps it's causing a frame shift or may have a stop codon.

Wait, no. The HA tag is usually added as a sequence before the target protein. For example, the HA epitope is YPYDVPDYA, which is 10 amino acids. The DNA sequence for this would be something like TAC CCC ATG GAT GTA TCC... Hmm. Wait, looking at the given sequence, the first few codons after ATG are TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTA (Val), TCC (Ser), etc. So the first few codons are actually ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC... So that would be Methionine, Tyr, Pro, Tyr, Asp, Val, Ser... which doesn't seem to match the HA epitope. Wait, the HA epitope is YPYDVPDYA, which in DNA would be:

YPYDVPDYA: each amino acid is three nucleotides.

Y: TAC
P: CCA
Y: TAC
D: GAT
V: GTA
P: CCA
D: GAT
Y: TAC
A: GCT

So the HA epitope coding sequence would be TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA CCA GAT TAC GCT.

Wait, in the given DNA, the first part after ATG is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC... So the first 15 nucleotides after ATG are TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC. Let me break this down:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC ...

So that's:

ATG (start) => Met
TAC => Tyr
CCA => Pro
TAC => Tyr
GAT => Asp
GTA => Val
TCC => Ser
...

Wait, that doesn't match the HA sequence I was thinking. The HA sequence should have TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA CCA GAT TAC GCT. But looking at the given sequence, after the initial ATG, it's TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC. Wait, the sixth codon is TCC (Ser), but in HA, after GTA (Val) comes CCA (Pro). So here, the sixth codon is TCC (Ser) instead of CCA (Pro). That's a change. So the HA sequence may have a mutation here, causing a missense mutation. That could be option A.

Alternatively, maybe the HA tag wasn't correctly inserted. Let me think about the construct. The construct is supposed to have the HA tag at the N-terminus, meaning the HA coding sequence comes before the GADD45G coding. So the given sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon for the HA. If the HA sequence is not correctly inserted, or if there's a mutation, the protein might not be expressed.

Looking back at the given sequence, the initial part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC... So the HA sequence (if that's the intended HA tag) has a mutation in the sixth codon. Instead of Pro (CCA), it's Ser (TCC). That would change the HA epitope, making it different. So this could be a problem. Maybe the HA epitope is supposed to be correctly present so that the protein can be detected by antibodies. If it's mutated, the antibody might not recognize it, making it hard to detect expression. Alternatively, maybe the mutation causes a frame shift, but in this case, the reading frame is maintained because the mutation is within the same codon. Wait, no, because the codon is TCC instead of CCA. So it's a change from Pro (CCA) to Ser (TCC), which is a missense mutation. So option A says the HA determinant has a missense mutation. That's a possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag is not present because the construct doesn't include it, but the question says the HA was introduced. So the problem is in the sequence.

Another possibility: perhaps the construct lacks a Kozak sequence or a proper ribosome binding site, but the question says the plasmid was modified correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a stop codon early in the sequence.

Wait, looking at the entire sequence, is there a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA) anywhere before the end? Let's scan through the sequence. The sequence given is quite long, but let's look for TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Looking through the nucleotides:

90. GAC (Asp)
91. CTG (Leu)
92. CAG (Gln)
93. CTC (Leu)
94. TAA (stop codon here)
Wait, look at codon 94: TAA. Oh! So in the given DNA sequence, there's a TAA stop codon at position 94 (assuming triplets starting from the beginning). So the sequence is 5' ... CTG CAG GAC CTG TAA ... 3' perhaps.

Wait, let me count the nucleotides. The sequence is a long one, so I'll count in triplets. Let me see: the initial part is 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA AGT CGC ... and so on.

Wait, but I think I saw a TAA somewhere. Let me see. Let me count from the start.

The first 100 nucleotides (approx):

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA AGT CGC GGC CAG GAC ACA CCG GAA AGC ACG CCA GGC TGC AGG TGC CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA GTC GGC GCC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTC CGG CGG TCT ACG AGT CAG CCA AGT CTT GAA CGT GGC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TCT GCT GTG GCT GCG GGT GAG GAG GAC GAG GGCGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Looking for TAA in the sequence. Let me scan for TAA. Let's look in the second half of the sequence.

Looking through:

...GCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA...

Wait, looking for TAA. Let me parse this section:

...GACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA...

Breaking into triplets:

GAC CTG CAG CAG TTA TCG AAG GCC ... wait, in the ...TTT CGA ACC CCG AGG... part, I don't see TAA.

Wait, perhaps earlier. Let me check:

Looking at the very end, the last part is ...CAGTGA. So the last codons are CAG (Gln) and TGA (stop). Wait, TGA is another stop codon. So the last codon is TGA. So the coding sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop.

But wait, what about earlier in the sequence. Let me look at the part that is:

...TGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA...

Looking for TAA. Hmm. Let me see, perhaps in the middle: 'TACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA'

Wait, in the part 'CCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA', I see 'TTT' and 'TGA'. Probably not a TAA there.

Wait, earlier in the sequence. Let me look again:

Looking at the sequence, the part 'TGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA'

Looking for 'TAA' in triplets. Let's see:

Another point: the part 'CTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA' — perhaps 'TAC' is present, but no TAA.

Wait, perhaps in the first part. Let me count the triplets again.

After the initial ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC (so that's 9 nucleotides), the next triplet is AGA (Arg), then AGT (Ser), CGC (Arg), GGC (Gly), CAG (Gln), GAC (Asp), ACA (Thr), CCG (Pro), GAA (Glu), AGC (Ser), TGG (Trp), ACC (Thr), TGG (Trp), GAG (Glu), etc.

Wait, looking for TAA. Let's go through all the triplets:

1. ATG
2. TAC (Tyr)
3. CCA (Pro)
4. TAC (Tyr)
5. GAT (Asp)
6. GTA (Val)
7. TCC (Ser)
8. AGA (Arg)
9. AGT (Ser)
10. CGC (Arg)
11. GGC (Gly)
12. CAG (Gln)
13. GAC (Asp)
14. ACA (Thr)
15. CCG (Pro)
16. GAA (Glu)
17. AGC (Ser)
18. TGG (Trp)
19. ACC (Thr)
20. TGG (Trp)
21. GAG (Glu)
22. GGC (Gly)
23. GCG (Ala)
24. GCC (Ala)
25. GGC (Gly)
26. CTG (Leu)
27. CAG (Gln)
28. GGT (Gly)
29. GCC (Ala)
30. CAG (Gln)
31. GAT (Asp)
32. TGC (Cys)
33. TAC (Tyr)
34. GAG (Glu)
35. TCC (Ser)
36. AAA (Lys)
37. GAC (Asp)
38. TGG (Trp)
39. ACC (Thr)
40. TGT (Cys)
41. GTG (Val)
42. GCT (Ala)
43. GCG (Ala)
44. TGG (Trp)
45. GAC (Asp)
46. GAG (Glu)
47. GCG (Ala)
48. CGC (Arg)
49. TTA (Leu)
50. TTT (Phe)
51. CGG (Arg)
52. GAC (Asp)
53. CTG (Leu)
54. CAG (Gln)
55. CTC (Leu)
56. TAA (stop codon here)
57. CGA (Arg)
58. GAG (Glu)
59. TGA (stop codon)
60. ... etc.

Wait, so at triplet 56, I see TAA, and triplet 59 is TGA. So that's two stop codons in the sequence. The first stop codon is TAA at position 56, and another TGA at position 59.

So this would mean that the coding sequence has a premature stop codon. That would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early, resulting in a truncated protein, or no protein at all if the stop is encountered before the HA tag is produced.

So, why is the protein not being expressed? Because there's a stop codon in the middle, the ribosome would terminate early, leading to no full-length protein. So the issue is that the reading frame includes a stop codon.

Wait, but why would a stop codon be present? Maybe during the construction of the plasmid, the HA tag wasn't correctly inserted, leading to a frameshift or an incorrect reading frame. Alternatively, perhaps there was a mistake in the PCR or cloning that introduced a stop codon.

In the given sequence, the presence of TAA and TGA stop codons suggests that the construct is introducing a premature stop. So the problem is that the HA tag isn't the only issue; the construct is actually causing the ribosome to stop early, leading to no overexpression of the intended protein.

Looking back at the options:

Option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would explain the lack of overexpression.

Option A is about a missense mutation in the HA determinant. That might affect detection or function but not necessarily prevent expression.

So the presence of TAA and TGA in the coding sequence suggests that the mRNA is being translated until it hits a stop codon, resulting in a truncated (or no) protein. That would prevent the overexpression of the desired protein.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct includes introns that were not spliced correctly, but the question states it's a CHO cell line, which is mammalian and does process introns, but the construct was modified for expression, so perhaps it's a problem with the sequence.

Wait, the plasmid was transfected into CHO cells. They're eukaryotic cells, so they require the correct promoter and other elements. But the issue here is in the coding sequence.

So, the main issue is the premature stop codons in the coding sequence. The presence of TAA and TGA would cause the ribosome to terminate early, resulting in no full-length protein. Therefore, the correct answer is option B: the ribosome terminated the translation early.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The researcher is attempting to overexpress the GADD45G protein fused with an HA tag at the N-terminus in a transgenic mouse model. However, the protein is not being expressed as expected. The provided DNA sequence shows that the coding region starts with the correct start codon (ATG) and includes the HA tag sequence. Upon closer inspection, the sequence contains premature stop codons (TAA and TGA) within the coding region. These stop codons would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the production of the full-length protein. This explains the lack of overexpression observed.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** While there is a mutation in the HA tag sequence (e.g., TCC instead of CCA at one position), this would primarily affect the recognition by antibodies but not necessarily prevent translation of the full-length protein. Thus, this is unlikely to be the main cause of the issue.
- **B) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** The presence of premature stop codons (TAA and TGA) in the coding sequence would lead to early termination of translation, resulting in no full-length protein. This aligns with the observed lack of overexpression.
- **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** There is no evidence in the sequence provided to suggest proteolysis is occurring. The issue lies in the coding sequence itself, not post-translational modifications.
- **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** UAA is a valid stop codon recognized by the ribosome, and its presence in the sequence would still result in premature termination, regardless of the availability of specific tRNAs.

The most likely explanation is that the premature stop codons in the coding sequence caused the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the expression of the full-length protein.

**Answer: B**
