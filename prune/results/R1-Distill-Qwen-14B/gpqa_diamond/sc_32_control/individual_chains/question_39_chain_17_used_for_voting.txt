Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the position, none of the particles were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So they're only between x=1 and x=3.

Hmm, right. So the wave function must be non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. Otherwise, the probability of finding the particle there would be zero. Wait, but wait. The wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So that's a complex function. Oh, but maybe the real part is the a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Wait, actually, in quantum mechanics, the wave function can be complex, but the probability density is the square of the absolute value. But in this case, the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the absolute square would be [a/sqrt(1+x)]² + (0.5)², because the imaginary part is -0.5i, so its magnitude is 0.5.

But wait, the problem says that when measuring the position, none were found outside x=1 to x=3. So that implies that the wave function must be zero outside this region. Because the probability of finding the particle outside is zero.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So for the wave function to be zero outside x=1 and x=3, it must be that the wave function is zero in those regions. But looking at the wave function, when x is less than 1 or greater than 3, how does it behave?

Wait, let's think about the denominator. The term is sqrt(1 + x). So when x is less than -1, sqrt(1+x) becomes imaginary. But in the problem, the particles are found only between x=1 and x=3. So for x <1 and x>3, the wave function must be zero.

But the given wave function isn't zero outside that region. So perhaps the given wave function is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. Or perhaps, the function is designed such that it's zero outside, but the way it's given is valid between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, the question says that the wave function in a part of space where it can exist is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So maybe this is the wave function between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere.

But then the normalization comes into play. The wave function must be normalized, so the integral of the absolute square over all space must be 1.

So let's model this. The wave function ψ(x) is equal to (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i for x between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise.

But wait, let me think again. Because the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So perhaps that's the full expression, but for the wave function to have zero probability outside 1 and 3, the wave function must be zero in those regions. So, it's like a piecewise function: ψ(x)= (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i when 1 ≤ x ≤3, and zero otherwise.

But wait, the given expression is not zero in that interval. So perhaps the given expression is valid only in the region where the particle exists, and is zero elsewhere. So the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and given by that expression there.

So to find the normalization constant a, we need to set the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 equal to 1.

The absolute square of ψ(x) is |(a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i|². Which is (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2, because when you square the magnitude, you add the squares of the real and imaginary parts.

So |ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Wait, wait: (a/sqrt(1+x)) is a real term, and the imaginary part is -0.5, so when you take the absolute value squared, it's (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2. Because (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 is a²/(1+x), and (0.5)^2 is 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Wait, but wait a minute. The wave function in this region has both real and imaginary components. So the normalization condition is the integral of |ψ|^2 dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

So let's compute that:

Integral of [ (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25 ] dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Let me compute each part separately.

First, the integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So this part becomes a² [ln(1+3) - ln(1+1)] = a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Because ln(4) is 2 ln(2), so 2 ln(2) - ln(2) is ln(2).

Next, the integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So combining both parts, the integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So the equation is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides: a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking the square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, so that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the setup. Because the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when you take the magnitude squared, it's (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2.

Yes, that's correct. So the integral is over [1,3] of (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx.

Yes, so the integral of a²/(1+x) is a² ln(2), as I calculated, and the integral of 0.25 is 0.5.

So a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) → a is sqrt(0.5/(ln(2))).

Let me calculate 0.5 divided by ln(2): 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Square root of that is about 0.849, so 0.85 is the value of a. So option B is correct.

To solve the problem, we analyze the given wave function and its normalization. The wave function is provided as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

This wave function is valid only between \(x = 1\) and \(x = 3\), where the particle exists, and it is zero outside this region. The normalization condition requires that the integral of the probability density \(|\psi(x)|^2\) over the interval \([1, 3]\) equals 1. 

### Step 1: Compute the probability density
The probability density is given by:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

### Step 2: Set up the normalization integral
The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \(\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx\)
2. \(\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx\)

### Step 3: Evaluate the integrals
1. The first integral is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_{1}^{3}
\]

\[
= a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

2. The second integral is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

### Step 4: Combine the results
Adding the two parts:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solve for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The value of \(a\) is approximately \(0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.
