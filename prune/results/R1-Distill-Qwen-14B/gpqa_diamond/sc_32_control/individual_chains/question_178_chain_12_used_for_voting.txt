Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the mass dimension of κ and determining whether the theory is renormalizable.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that in QFT, the renormalizability depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constant. If the dimension is too high, the theory might not be renormalizable.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of each field and the coupling κ. The mass dimension is usually determined using the equation [L] = [mass]^4, since the Lagrangian has units of energy density (mass^4 in natural units where ħ=c=1).

Breaking down each part:

ψ is a spinor field. I think the mass dimension of a Dirac spinor field ψ is 3/2. Because in 4 dimensions, the Dirac field has dimension 3/2. Wait, how's that? Because in 4D, the action integral has to be dimensionless. The Dirac Lagrangian term is iψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, and the derivative ∂_μ has dimension mass^1. So the term must have dimension 4, so ψ̄ ψ must have dimension 3 because each ψ is 3/2. Wait, wait, let's think more carefully.

Each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So for the kinetic term, i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, each ψ has dimension 3/2. Because 3/2 (ψ̄) + 1 (from ∂_μ) + 3/2 (ψ) = 4. Yep, so ψ has dimension 3/2.

Now, σ_{μν} is a product of two gamma matrices and a commutator, but I don't think that affects the mass dimension. It's a Lorentz tensor built from the gamma matrices. Since the gamma matrices are dimensionless (they are just matrices), σ_{μν} is also dimensionless. So when we calculate the dimension of the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F, each ψ̄ and ψ has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ would be (3/2) + (3/2) = 3.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor of the electromagnetic field (I think it's similar to the field strength for a gauge field). The field strength tensor F has mass dimension 2. Because in electromagnetism, the field tensor F_{μν} is built from derivatives of the gauge field A, which has dimension 1. So the derivatives contribute 1 each, making F have dimension 2.

So putting it all together, the term is κ multiplied by (ψ̄ σ ψ) which is dimension 3, multiplied by F^{μν}, which is dimension 2. So the total dimension for L_int would be [κ] + 3 + 2 = [κ] +5.

But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, so [κ] +5 =4. Therefore, [κ] =4-5= -1. So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Wait, but wait a second. The term is actually κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. So the structure is a product of two spinor terms (ψ̄ and ψ) and F. Let me make sure I count correctly.

Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ is 3/2 as well. So ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. F^{μν} is 2. So the product is 3 +2 =5. The Lagrangian term must be dimension 4. So κ * 5 =4. So κ must have dimension 4-5= -1. So [κ]=-1. So that would make option A or C possible, since those have [κ]=-1.

But wait, the question is about whether the theory is renormalizable. Renormalizability depends on the coupling's dimension. The general rule is that a coupling with dimension greater than zero (in 4D) makes the theory non-renormalizable because the interaction term would have a higher dimension, leading to higher order divergences that can't be absorbed by the same counterterms.

Wait, wait, no—wait, the mass dimension has to be considered in terms of the power of the coupling. For a term to be renormalizable, the coupling's dimension must be ≥0. So if κ has dimension -1, that's negative. So the interaction term is of dimension 4 (since [L] is 4), but each insertion of the coupling κ would contribute a factor of [κ], which is negative. So for a theory to be renormalizable, all couplings must have positive or zero mass dimensions.

Because the coupling's dimension is negative (-1), each vertex would bring in a negative mass dimension. So when considering loop integrals, the superficial degree of divergence can be calculated. If the coupling has negative dimension, it might mean that the interaction is relevant or irrelevant. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy here.

Wait, in 4 dimensions, the superficial degree of divergence is D = 4 - L*( [coupling dimensions] ), but I think the formula is a bit more involved. Alternatively, the renormalizability condition is that the coupling has a dimension ≤4. Wait, no, I think in 4D, a coupling's dimension must be ≥0 for the term to be renormalizable. Because each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So if the coupling has dimension [κ], then [κ] = (4 - sum of fields' dimensions) for each term.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the general form. The term in the Lagrangian is L = g φ^n, where g is the coupling. For renormalizability, the dimension of g must be ≥0. Because in 4D, the dimension of each φ is (d-2)/2, where d is the spacetime dimension. So for d=4, φ has dimension (4-2)/2=1. So for a term like g φ^k, the dimension is [g] + k*(1) must equal 4. So [g] =4 -k.

In 4D, the theory is renormalizable if [g] is ≥0. So 4 -k ≥0 → k ≤4.

In our case, the coupling is κ. The term is L_int = κ (ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ) F^{μν}. So the fields involved are ψ, ψ, and F.

Wait, let me think about the field content. ψ is a spinor, so each has dimension 3/2. F is a field strength tensor, which is a tensor of dimension 2, as we said before.

So the term is product of two ψs (ψ̄ and ψ), each 3/2, and F, which is 2.

Wait, but in the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F, the dimensions would be: [κ] + 2*(3/2) + 2 = [κ] +3 +2= [κ] +5. Because each ψ is 3/2, F is 2. So [L] =4 → [κ] +5=4 → [κ]=-1.

So the dimension is -1, which is negative. So κ has negative mass dimension, which implies that the term is non-renormalizable. Because in renormalizable theories, all couplings must have dimensions ≥0. So since κ has dimension -1, the theory isn't renormalizable.

So putting it together: [κ]=-1, theory is not renormalizable. Looking at the options, that's option C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The Dirac spinor field $\psi$ has a mass dimension of $\frac{3}{2}$ in 4 spacetime dimensions.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$, which is derived from derivatives of the gauge field, has a mass dimension of $2$.
- The term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi$ involves two spinor fields, so it has a total mass dimension of $\frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$ must have a mass dimension of $4$ in 4 spacetime dimensions. The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ includes $\kappa$, which is the coupling constant, and the fields $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi$ (dimension $3$) and $F^{\mu\nu}$ (dimension $2$). Thus, the total mass dimension of the term is:

\[
[\kappa] + 3 + 2 = 4.
\]

Solving for $[\kappa]$, we find:

\[
[\kappa] = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Since $\kappa$ has a mass dimension of $-1$, which is negative, the interaction term is non-renormalizable. Non-renormalizable theories typically require an infinite number of counterterms to handle divergences, making them less predictive at higher energy scales.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to **Option C**.
