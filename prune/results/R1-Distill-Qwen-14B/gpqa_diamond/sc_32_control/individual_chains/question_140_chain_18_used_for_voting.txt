Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Additionally, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Hmm. So, I need to figure out what X is. Let's break this down.

First, the reaction between X and Y. Gas W: same number of neutrons and protons. So, each molecule of W has equal number of n and p. So, possible options are H2O? Wait, no. Let's think. If W is a molecule, then maybe it's something like CO? No, that's a gas but not sure about the n and p. Wait, another approach: the molecule must be electrically neutral, so it's a molecule, not an ion.

Wait, what atoms have equal numbers of protons and neutrons? Let's think about some elements. For example, deuterium (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So its isotope's molecule would have equal numbers. But wait, the molecule itself has same number of n and p. Or wait, maybe the molecule is something like H2O, but that's 2 H and an O. Let's calculate H2O's protons and neutrons. Hydrogen has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (if it's protium), but that's not equal. Wait, maybe the molecule is something else.

Alternatively, think about H2. Each H has 1 proton. So H2 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (if it's D2, deuterium). Because each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So D2 would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So for each molecule of D2, protons = 2, neutrons = 2. So the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. So W could be D2 gas, but that's just H2, but heavier isotope. Alternatively, it could be another molecule.

Wait, but the problem states that W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So per molecule, not per atom. So let's think: maybe CO2? No, because each CO2 molecule has 1 C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and 2 O (8 each). Let's compute total protons and neutrons in the molecule. C: 6p, 6n. Each O: 8p, 8n (assuming ^16O). So CO2 has 6+16=22 protons, and 6 + 16 = 22 neutrons. So 22 each. So yes, W could be CO2. But that's a possibility, but not sure if that's the case.

Wait, another possibility: CH4. Let's see: C has 6p and 6n, H each has 1p and 0n. So total protons: 6 +4=10. Neutrons:6. Not equal. So that's not it.

What about O2? Each O has 8p, 8n. So O2 has 16p, 16n. So same number. So W could be O2. Alternatively, O3, but same idea. But then, O2 is a common gas.

Wait, but the reaction produces gas W. So what reactions produce O2 as a gas? Maybe a decomposition reaction, like thermal decomposition. Hmm.

Alternatively, think about other diatomic gases. H2, O2, N2, etc. For example, if W is H2, then each H is 1p and 1n (if it's deuterium), so the molecule would have 2p and 2n. So equal. So yes, H2 could be W if it's deuterium.

Wait, but the question says substance X incorporates a heavier isotope. So perhaps X is something like D2O, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, let's think about the reaction. X reacts with Y to produce W, G, and B upon heating. Then, when G is heated, it releases B.

So, perhaps X is a base, Y is an acid, reaction forms a precipitate. Or maybe X is something else.

Wait, the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. What compounds release a substance upon heating? Maybe a carbonate decomposes into CO2 and a metal oxide. For example, if G is a carbonate, heating it would produce CO2 and the metal oxide. But the melting point of B is near 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. So B is a solid at room temperature but melts just above 0. So what has a melting point around there? Maybe water (0 C, 273 K). Hmm, but 277 K is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe another compound.

Wait, melting points around 277 K. Let me think. Water freezes at 273 K (0 C). So 277 K is about 4 C. What substance melts around there? Perhaps something like a hydrate? Or maybe an oxide?

Wait, another approach: What if B is NaOH? No, NaOH is solid, but its melting point is higher. Maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe B is something like CO2, but that's a gas. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal, but I'm not sure.

Wait, if G is a carbonate, and when heated, it produces B and CO2. The B could be a metal oxide. But then, what's the melting point? Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound. Let's see.

Another thought: perhaps the reaction is between a metal carbonate and an acid. For example, if Y is an acid, and X is a metal carbonate. Then, the reaction would produce CO2 gas. So W would be CO2. Then, G could be a salt that precipitates. Wait, but what's the precipitate when a carbonate reacts with an acid? Maybe not, because carbonates usually react with acids to produce gas (CO2), water, and a salt. So the salt may or may not precipitate, depending on its solubility.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a hydroxide. For example, if X is NaOH, and Y is an acid like H2SO4, then the reaction would produce water and Na2SO4. Na2SO4 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, and Y is an acid. So the reaction would produce H2 gas (if it's a metal reacting with acid), a salt, and maybe a precipitate if the salt is insoluble.

Wait, but earlier I thought W is H2 or CO2. Let me think again.

If W is CO2, then the reaction must be producing CO2. So, perhaps Y is something like an acid, and X is a carbonate. The reaction would be X (carbonate) + Y (acid) → CO2 + water + salt.

But then, the precipitate G would be the salt. But if the salt is insoluble, it precipitates. So for example, if X is calcium carbonate and Y is hydrochloric acid, then the reaction would produce CO2, water, and CaCl2, which is soluble. So no precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal hydroxide. For example, if X is NaOH and Y is H2SO4, then the reaction produces Na2SO4, water. But Na2SO4 is soluble, so no precipitate.

Wait, maybe X is a metal, and Y is a salt solution. For example, if X is sodium metal reacting with a solution of a lead nitrate. Then, perhaps some displacement happens, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is water. If X reacts violently with water, like sodium reacting to produce H2 gas. So W would be H2.

But if W is H2, then each molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (if it's D2). So that fits the condition: same number of protons and neutrons in each molecule.

So, W is H2 gas, which is produced when X reacts with Y (probably water). So X is a metal that reacts violently with water, releasing H2 gas.

Which metals react violently with water? Potassium, sodium, perhaps lithium. Let's say X is sodium. Sodium reacts with water to produce NaOH, H2, and heat. The reaction equation is 2 Na + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2↑.

So, in this case, the precipitate G would be... wait, but sodium hydroxide is soluble in water. So perhaps G is not a precipitate. Hmm. Maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a different liquid. Maybe Y is an acid, and X is a carbonate. Let's think again.

Wait, another angle: the product of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So, when a keto acid (like acetic acid) reacts with X, the product has 2 O atoms. Let me think about what reactions involve adding a group with 2 O's. For example, perhaps X is something like NaOH. Wait, acetic acid + NaOH → sodium acetate + water. Sodium acetate is CH3COONa, which has more O's, but maybe the product refers to something else.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an oxidizing agent. Or a reducing agent. Or maybe X is something like a halogen, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the product of a keto acid with X has 2 O atoms. So the product could be an ester or something. Alternatively, perhaps the product is something like an acid anhydride, but that's just a guess.

Wait, maybe X is a base, like KOH. When a keto acid (RCOOR') reacts with a base, perhaps it undergoes hydrolysis. But that's not forming a product with 2 O's. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal, and the reaction forms a carboxylate salt. For example, acetic acid + sodium metal → sodium acetate and hydrogen gas. Sodium acetate has more O's than the acid. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a halogen, and the reaction is an addition. For example, adding Br2 to a keto acid (like acetic acid). But I'm not recalling the exact reactions.

Wait, another approach: the product has 2 O atoms. So, the product could be something like CO2, but that's from a decomposition. Or maybe it's a diethyl ether or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester. For example, a keto acid (like acetic acid) reacting with an alcohol to form an ester (like ethyl acetate). But in that case, X would be an alcohol. But I'm not sure if that's relevant.

Wait, perhaps the product refers to the number of O atoms in the molecule. So, if the keto acid has, say, two O's, and X adds another O, but that's not making sense. Alternatively, maybe the product has two O's in a certain part.

Alternatively, think about a nucleophilic attack. For example, a keto acid undergoing nucleophilic attack by X, which could be something like a hydroxide ion.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to figure out what X is.

X is a reagent in organic chemistry. So, common reagents include NaOH, H2SO4, KMnO4, etc. But the problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope. So, maybe X is something like D2O (heavy water), but that's a possibility.

Wait, if X is heavy water (D2O), then when it reacts with an acid (like H2SO4), perhaps it produces D2 gas? But D2 isn't typically produced in such reactions. Alternatively, the reaction could be with a metal, producing H2 (but if X is D2O, the reaction might produce D2 gas instead).

Alternatively, perhaps X is a deuterated compound. Let's say X is NaOD (sodium deuteride), but I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to the reaction. X reacts with Y to produce gas W, which has same number of protons and neutrons per molecule. So, if W is D2, then each molecule has 2 D atoms, each with 1p and 1n. So total protons in molecule: 2, neutrons: 2. So that fits.

So, if W is D2, then X reacts with Y to produce D2 gas. Then, Y would be a protic acid (like H2O, but if X is NaOD, reacting with H2O would produce D2 and NaOH? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is NaD, and Y is H2O, producing D2 gas.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal that reacts with an acid. For example, Mg reacting with H2SO4 would produce H2 gas.

But wait, if W is H2 and X is Mg, then Mg reacts with Y (acid) to produce H2. Then, perhaps the precipitate is MgSO4, but MgSO4 is soluble, so that's not a precipitate.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B, whose melting point is ~277 K. So suppose G is a carbonate, and upon heating, it decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2 gas. Then B would be the metal oxide. The melting point of B is 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. So, which metal oxides have melting points around that? Hmm, maybe something like Na2O? Let's check. Sodium oxide (Na2O) has a melting point of around 1460°C, which is way higher. That's not matching.

Wait, perhaps B is a different compound. Maybe a hydrate? For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O) has a melting point around 277 K? Wait, 277 K is about 4°C. So when G is heated, it releases B, which is a solid at that temperature.

Alternatively, think about water: if B is water, melting point is 273 K (0°C), but 277 K is 4°C. So maybe B is water, and the melting point is close to that. So, perhaps the reaction produces water as B.

Wait, but in the reaction, X reacts with Y to produce W gas, G precipitate, and when G is heated, it releases B. So if B is water, perhaps G is a hydrate that, when heated, releases water.

Wait, perhaps G is a carbonate hydroxide, which upon heating decomposes into a metal oxide and water. For example, NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate) decomposes upon heating to Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. So, in that case, B would be H2O. The melting point of water is 273 K (0°C), but the question says it's close to 277 K. Hmm, 277 is 4°C, so maybe it's a different form or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps B is something else. Let's think of other possibilities.

Wait, another angle: the product of the reaction between X and a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. So, perhaps X is adding two oxygens to the keto acid. For example, if X is an oxidizing agent, it could oxidize the keto acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, if X is a base, like NaOH, and the keto acid is something like acetic acid, then the reaction would produce sodium acetate, which has more O's than the acid. So that doesn't fit the 2 O's idea.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester. For example, acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacting with an alcohol (like ethanol) in the presence of an acid catalyst produces ethyl acetate (CH3COOCH2CH3), which has more O's, but maybe the product is something else.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone. If the keto acid is something like propanoic acid, and X is a reagent that removes a water molecule to form a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an acid anhydride, but that adds more O's.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck on this part. Let's try to look for another clue.

The question says that X and especially its analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. So, possible reagents include things like NaOH, KOH, H2SO4, etc. But the fact that X incorporates a heavier isotope suggests it's a compound with a heavy isotope. For example, heavy water (D2O) is used in some reactions as a reagent.

Wait, if X is D2O (heavy water), then when it reacts with a metal (like Mg), it might produce D2 gas. So W would be D2, which has 2 H's (but heavy isotopes). Each D has 1p and 1n, so W is D2, which has 2p and 2n. That fits the condition.

Then, Y could be Mg, perhaps? Or another metal. Wait, Mg reacts with water (even heavy water, but perhaps more slowly) to produce Mg(OH)2 and H2 gas. But if X is D2O, then the reaction would produce D2 gas. So W is D2.

Wait, but Mg and D2O reaction:  Mg + 2 D2O → Mg(OH)2 + D2↑. Then, the precipitate G would be Mg(OH)2, which is a white precipitate.

Then, when G is heated, it would decompose into MgO and H2O (but wait, since X is D2O, maybe it's H2O or D2O? Hmm. No, perhaps the decomposition would produce H2O. So B would be H2O, which has a melting point of 273 K. The problem states it's close to 277 K, which is 4°C. Hmm, that's a bit off. Alternatively, maybe B is something else.

Wait, another thought. If the precipitate G is MgCO3, and when heated, it decomposes into MgO and CO2. Then B would be CO2, which is a gas, not a solid. So that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a sulfide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is NaOH, and Y is CO2. Then, the reaction would produce Na2CO3, which is soluble. No precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a salt that reacts with X to form a precipitate. For example, if X is AgNO3 and Y is NaCl, the reaction produces AgCl precipitate. But that doesn't fit with the gas W part.

Wait, another angle: the gas W has same number of protons and neutrons. So W could be CH4, but that's 4p and 4n (each H has 1p, C has 6p; but wait, no, CH4 has 6+1*4=10p and 6+4*0=6n. Not equal. So that's not it. Hmm.

Wait, maybe W is O2. Each O atom has 8p and 8n. So O2 has 16p and 16n. So that fits. So W is O2 gas.

So, what reaction produces O2 gas? Maybe a decomposition of a carbonate or a peroxide.

Suppose X is a peroxide, like H2O2. When H2O2 decomposes, it produces O2. But then, what's Y? Maybe heat or a catalyst. But in that case, the reaction would be 2 H2O2 → 2 H2O + O2↑. But then, the precipitate G would be H2O, which is a liquid. Hmm, not a precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid. The reaction produces CO2 gas. But then, W is CO2, which has 22p and 22n (if using ^12C and ^16O). So that fits.

So, CO2 has 12 (from C: 6p, 6n) + 16*2 (each O has 8p, 8n) → total p: 6 + 16 = 22, n:6 + 16=22. So yes, same number. So W is CO2.

So, if X is a carbonate, Y is an acid, reaction produces CO2, a salt, and water. If the salt is insoluble, it forms a precipitate G.

For example, X could be CaCO3, Y is HCl. The reaction is CaCO3 + 2 HCl → CaCl2 + CO2↑ + H2O. CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe X is Ag2CO3 (silver carbonate), which is not very common, but reacts with an acid to produce Ag salts. But AgCl is insoluble, so if Y is HCl, the precipitate would be AgCl.

So, the reaction would be Ag2CO3 + 2 HCl → 2 AgCl ↓ + CO2↑ + H2O.

In this case, W is CO2, G is AgCl precipitate. When G is heated, AgCl decomposes into Ag and Cl2 (but that's at high temperatures). Wait, but the question says when heated, releases B. If B is a solid with a melting point near 277 K, perhaps B is Ag. Silver's melting point is about 961°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track again.

Let me try to approach the problem from another angle. The product of the reaction between X and a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. So perhaps X is a dienophile or something that adds across a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a base that deprotonates the keto acid, forming its conjugate base. For example, acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacts with NaOH to form CH3COO^- Na^+ and water. The product would have more O's, but I don't see how it relates to 2 O's.

Wait, maybe the product is an acetal or a ketal. But that would require reacting with an alcohol and acid catalyst, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a reagent that adds two oxygen atoms to the keto acid. For example, oxidation. If the keto acid is something like propanoic acid, and X is KMnO4 under acidic conditions, it might oxidize it further, but that would produce more O's, not exactly 2.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the product is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. The keto acid could form a lactone by losing water, but that would involve two O's in a ring. Not sure.

Alternatively, the product might be a ketone, but that would require removing an O, which doesn't fit with adding X.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck on this. Let me think about the other parts again.

Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's known for incorporating a heavier isotope. Heavy isotopes are often used in such contexts. So, perhaps X is something like D2O (heavy water), which is used in reactions to slow down reactions or in isotope effects.

So if X is D2O, then when it reacts with a metal (like Mg), it produces D2 gas. So W is D2. D2 has 2p and 2n. So that fits the condition.

Then, Y would be Mg. The reaction is Mg + 2 D2O → Mg(OH)2 + D2↑. Wait, but Mg(OH)2 is not the same as precipitate G. Wait, Mg(OH)2 is a white precipitate, so G would be Mg(OH)2.

Then, when G is heated, it would decompose into MgO and H2O. But if the reaction uses D2O, perhaps it's D2O that's released? So B would be H2O. The melting point of H2O is 273 K (0°C), but the question states it's close to 277 K. Hmm, that's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps B is something else.

Wait, perhaps G is MgCO3 (magnesium carbonate), which upon heating releases CO2 and MgO. But then, W would be CO2, which would fit. So in this case, W is CO2, so the reaction is between X and Y (maybe an acid) to produce CO2, MgCl2 (if Y is HCl), but MgCl2 is soluble. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, and Y is H2SO4. The reaction would produce CO2, and the precipitate would be something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is sodium hydroxide, and Y is carbon dioxide. But that would form sodium carbonate, which is soluble. No precipitate.

Wait, maybe the precipitate is due to excess X. For example, if X is AgNO3 and Y is NaCl, then AgCl precipitates. But that doesn't fit with the gas W being CO2.

Wait, maybe the reaction is between X (a carbonate) and Y (a strong acid) to produce CO2, and the precipitate is something else, like a sulfate if Y is sulfuric acid. For example, calcium carbonate + sulfuric acid → calcium sulfate (insoluble, so precipitate), CO2, and water.

So, if X is CaCO3, Y is H2SO4, then the reaction is: CaCO3 + H2SO4 → CaSO4↓ + CO2↑ + H2O. CaSO4 is a precipitate. Then, when heated, CaSO4 doesn't decompose, so that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is a sulfide. Wait, no, because the reaction produces CO2, so it's a carbonate reacting with acid.

Hmm, perhaps I should move to the part about the product of a keto acid with X having 2 oxygen atoms. Let's think: if X is NaOH, and the keto acid is, say, acetic acid, the product is sodium acetate, which has 4 O's. Doesn't fit. Alternatively, if X is something else.

Wait, perhaps X is a base that deprotonates the keto acid, and the product is a carboxylate salt. For example, if the keto acid is formic acid (HCOOH), and X is NaOH, the product is NaHCOO, which has 2 O's in the COO^- part. Wait, formate ion (HCOO^-) has two O's. So the product would have two O's from the acid part. That could fit.

So, if X is NaOH, then reacting with formic acid (a keto acid) produces sodium formate, which has the formate ion (HCOO^- Na^+). The formate ion has two O's in the COO^- group. So the product has 2 O's in that part. That might fit the condition.

So, in this scenario, X is NaOH.

Wait, but the problem says that X incorporates a heavier isotope. So, perhaps X is NaOD (sodium deuteride) or something similar. Or perhaps it's a heavier isotope in another element.

Wait, but NaOH is Na, O, H. If it's incorporating a heavier isotope, perhaps the oxygen is ^18O, or the hydrogen is D (deuterium). So, for example, NaOD would have a heavier isotope of H.

Now, back to the reaction: X (NaOD) reacts with Y (an acid like H2SO4) to produce what? The reaction would be NaOD + H2SO4 → NaHSO4 + D2O? Not sure. Or perhaps it's a neutralization reaction: NaOD + H2O → NaOH + D2? Not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps X is NaOH, and Y is an acid. The reaction produces water and a salt.

Wait, but if X is NaOH, then when it reacts with Y (maybe an acid), the reaction would be neutralization, producing water and a salt. But that doesn't produce a precipitate unless the salt is insoluble.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a salt solution where the cation forms an insoluble hydroxide. For example, Y is a solution of Al(NO3)3. Then, X (NaOH) reacts to form Al(OH)3 precipitate.

So, the reaction would be: Al(NO3)3 + NaOH → Al(OH)3 ↓ + NaNO3.

In this case, W would be... wait, no gas is produced. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to piece together what we know.

1. W's molecule has equal number of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates are H2 (if deuterium), CO2, O2, etc.
2. G is a precipitate formed when X reacts with Y. Heating G releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K (~4°C).
3. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry and has a heavier isotope.
4. Reaction product between X and a keto acid has 2 O atoms.

Given all this, perhaps X is a base like NaOH, which is used in many organic reactions.

Wait, but if X is NaOH, then what is Y? If Y is something that reacts with NaOH to produce a gas. For example, Y could be an acid, but that would produce water and a salt, not a gas.

Alternatively, Y could be a carbonate. For example, NaOH reacts with a carbonate to produce CO2 gas. But then, the precipitate would be... perhaps nothing, as the products are soluble.

Wait, another angle: if Y is an alcohol, and X is a dehydrating agent, like H2SO4. Then, the reaction could produce an ether or an alkene, releasing water. But that would produce water vapor, not a gas with equal protons and neutrons.

Alternatively, perhaps X is H2SO4, and Y is a carbonate. The reaction would produce CO2, but then G would be the sulfate, which is soluble. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal, like Zn, which reacts with H2SO4 to produce ZnSO4 (soluble), water, and H2 gas. So W is H2, which has 2p and 2n if it's D2, but Zn doesn't react with D2O to produce H2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is Zn, Y is H2SO4. Reaction: Zn + H2SO4 → ZnSO4 + H2↑. So W is H2. Then, the precipitate G would be nothing because ZnSO4 is soluble. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I should look for the answer based on the options given.

The question is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X.

The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

So, possible elements in X could be, for example, Na and O. Sodium has atomic mass ~23, O is ~16. Sum is 39, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains H and O. H is ~1, O is ~16. If X is H2O, then the elements are H and O. The lightest is H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum:17. Not an option.

Wait, but if X has isotopes. For example, if X is D2O (heavy water), then elements are D (which is H, ~2) and O (~16). So lightest is H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum 17. Not matching options.

Alternatively, if X is something like CH3OH (methanol), elements C, H, O. Lightest is H (1), heaviest C (12). Sum 13. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X contains Cl and another element. Cl has atomic mass ~35.5. If X is NaCl, then elements Na (~23) and Cl (~35.5). Lightest Na, heaviest Cl. Sum 23+35.5=58.5, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is NH3, which contains N and H. N is ~14, H is 1. Sum 15. Not an option.

Wait, another approach: the product of X and a keto acid has 2 O atoms. So, perhaps the product is a ketone, which has one O. Or maybe an ester, which has more. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is an acetal. For example, if X is a base that deprotonates the keto acid, forming an enolate, which then can react with an alcohol to form an acetal. But the product would have more O's, not just 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketal, but again, more O's.

Hmm, perhaps the product is a hemiacetal. Not sure.

Wait, another possibility: if X is a reducing agent, it might reduce the keto acid. For example, reducing a ketone to an alcohol. But that would add H's, not O's.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), which is a polar aprotic solvent used in organic reactions. But I'm not sure how that would relate to the product having 2 O's.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like PCl5, which can convert carboxylic acids to acid chlorides. For example, a keto acid (like acetic acid) reacts with PCl5 to form acetyl chloride, which has Cl but not sure about O's.

Hmm, I think I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again. The options are 25, 29, 31,35.

Wait, if X is NaOH, the elements are Na (23), O (16), H (1). So lightest H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum 24, not an option.

If X is KOH, elements K (39), O (16), H (1). Sum 1+39=40. Not an option.

If X is H2O (light or heavy), elements H and O. Sum 1+16=17. Not an option.

If X is something like C2H5OH (ethanol), elements C (12), H (1), O (16). Lightest H, heaviest C. Sum 17. Not matching.

Wait, maybe X is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid). But no, X is a reagent, not the acid.

Wait, perhaps X is something like CH3COO^- Na^+ (sodium acetate). But again, elements would be C, H, O, Na. Lightest H, heaviest Na. Sum 1+23=24. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule. For example, O2. But that doesn't fit the other conditions.

Wait, another thought: if X is H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide), then elements H and O. H has 1, O has 16. Sum 17. Not an option.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider the possibility that X contains two different isotopes, like a mixture. But the question says it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So, perhaps X is a compound where one of its atoms is a heavier isotope.

Wait, for example, if X is NaOH, where one H is D (deuterium). So X would be NaOD. Then, the elements present are Na, O, D. So, the lightest is D (2), heaviest Na (23). Sum 2 +23=25. Oh, option B is 25.

So that would fit. Let me check.

So, X is NaOD. It reacts with Y (maybe an acid) to produce D2 gas. The product of NaOD with a keto acid (like formic acid) could be sodium formate, which has two O's in the formate ion. That fits the 2 O's condition.

Then, the reaction between NaOD and Y (say, H2SO4) would produce D2 gas. So W is D2, which has 2p and 2n, satisfying the condition.

The precipitate G would be, perhaps, a sulfate, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the reaction with Y is different.

When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. If B is H2O (melting point 273 K), perhaps the heating of G produces H2O. But G would need to be a hydrate or something that releases water upon heating.

Alternatively, if G is a carbonate hydroxide, heating it would produce CO2 and water.

But in any case, the key point is that the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X are 2 (D) and 23 (Na), summing to 25. Which is option B.

The problem involves identifying Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts with Liquid Y to release Gas W, forms Precipitate G, and releases Compound B upon heating. Additionally, the product of X with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates are H₂ (if deuterium is present, D₂), CO₂, or O₂. However, D₂ fits better with the context of X incorporating a heavier isotope.

2. **Substance X**: X is a reagent in organic chemistry and incorporates a heavier isotope. A plausible candidate is NaOD (sodium deuteride), where one hydrogen is replaced by deuterium (D). This fits the description of incorporating a heavier isotope.

3. **Reaction with Y**: If X is NaOD and Y is an acid (e.g., H₂SO₄), the reaction could produce D₂ gas, satisfying the condition that W has equal numbers of protons and neutrons.

4. **Precipitate G**: When NaOD reacts with an acid, a salt may precipitate. For example, if Y is H₂SO₄, the reaction could produce a sulfate salt, which might precipitate depending on its solubility.

5. **Compound B**: When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K (~4°C). If B is water (H₂O), its melting point is 273 K (0°C), which is close enough to satisfy the condition. This aligns with the decomposition of hydrates or carbonates.

6. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product of X (NaOD) and a keto acid (e.g., formic acid) could be sodium formate, which contains two oxygen atoms in the formate ion (HCOO⁻). This satisfies the condition that the product contains 2 oxygen atoms.

7. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**: X contains sodium (Na, atomic mass ~23), oxygen (O, atomic mass ~16), and deuterium (D, atomic mass ~2). The lightest element is D (2), and the heaviest is Na (23). Their cumulative atomic masses sum to 25.

### Conclusion:
The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest (D, 2) and heaviest (Na, 23) elements in X sum to **25**. This matches **Option B**.
