Okay, so I've got this question about general relativity or maybe differential geometry, I'm not exactly sure, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the area of a pseudosphere with a given metric. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature, right?

The metric provided is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) * (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, because it's in terms of dx and dy. So the space here is 2D, but the term "pseudosphere" might be a bit confusing. Oh wait, in 2D, a pseudosphere is just a surface with negative curvature, like a saddle shape. But the question is about the area of this pseudosphere when the radius r is 2.

Wait, the radius is given as r=2. But I'm not exactly sure how that relates to the metric. The metric has a denominator 4 - x² - y², which looks like 4 is 2². So maybe the radius squared is 4, so r=2. That makes sense.

I'm trying to remember how to compute the area in a given metric. In general, the area element in 2D is usually something like sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. But wait, in this case, the metric is written in a way that's already factored into dx² + dy² multiplied by some function. So this is a conformally flat metric, meaning it's like a scaling of the Euclidean metric.

The metric tensor g in components would be diag[ a², a² ], where a² = 32/(4 - x² - y²). Wait, no, because the given metric is (32/(4 - ... )) times (dx² + dy²), so in matrix form, the metric tensor g would have g_{xx} = 32/(4 - x² - y²), g_{yy} = same thing, and the off-diagonal terms are zero. So the determinant of this metric is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². Wait, no, because the determinant for a diagonal matrix is the product of the diagonal elements. So g = (32/(4 - r²))^2, where r² is x² + y², right?

So the area element dA would be sqrt(g) dx dy. Wait, but wait, the square root of the determinant is sqrt([32/(4 - r²)]^2) ), which is 32/(4 - r²). So dA = [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] dx dy.

Wait, that's the area element for this metric. So the total area would be the double integral of dA over the region where the metric is defined. But what is the region where this metric is valid? The denominator 4 - x² - y² must be positive, otherwise the metric would blow up. So 4 - x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² < 4. So the domain is the disk of radius 2 (since sqrt(x² + y²) < 2).

So the area A is the integral over x² + y² < 4 of [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] dx dy.

Hmm, that's the integral in 2D. Since the integrand is radially symmetric, maybe we can switch to polar coordinates. Let me try that.

In polar coordinates, x² + y² = r², and dx dy = r dr dθ. So substituting, the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 / (4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Breaking it into angular and radial parts:

A = 2π * ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

So let's compute that integral. Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → r dr = -du/2.

Wait, when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So substituting:

∫ (r=0→2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr → ∫ (u=4→0) [32 * (r dr) / u ] → since r dr is -du/2, the integral becomes:

32 ∫ (4→0) [ (-du/2) / u ] → 32 * (1/2) ∫ (0→4) (1/u) du.

Because I flipped the limits, so the negative sign cancels.

So 32*(1/2) ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du → 16 * [ ln(u) ] from 0 to 4.

Wait, but ln(4) minus ln(0). Oh wait, ln(0) is negative infinity. Hmm, that suggests that the integral diverges. So the area would be infinite?

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the pseudosphere has finite area? Or does it?

Wait, no, a pseudosphere in 2D (which is a hyperbolic plane) actually has infinite area. Because the hyperbolic plane has constant negative curvature and is non-compact. So in this case, the metric would define a hyperbolic plane, and its total area would be infinite.

So the area of the pseudosphere (in this case, the hyperbolic plane) of radius r=2 would be infinite. So looking at the options, option D is +infty. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but let me double-check the integral. Let me compute it again.

The integral in r is ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let u =4 -r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So the integral becomes ∫ (32) * [r dr/(4 - r²)] = ∫ 32 * (-du/2) / u.

Which is -16 ∫ du / u from u=4 to u=0.

Which is -16 [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0 → -16 ( ln(0) - ln(4) ) → as ln(0) approaches negative infinity, this becomes -16 ( -infty - ln4 ), which is -16*(-infty) → positive infinity.

So the integral indeed diverges. So the area is infinite, so option D is correct.

The problem involves calculating the area of a pseudosphere with the given metric:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

where the radius is \( r = 2 \). The pseudosphere corresponds to a hyperbolic plane in this context, which has constant negative curvature. To compute the area, we use the area element in curved spacetime, which is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \( \det(g) \) is the determinant of the metric tensor. For this conformally flat metric, the determinant is:

\[
\det(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The region of integration is where the metric is defined, i.e., \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0 \), which corresponds to the disk \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \). Switching to polar coordinates (\( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \), \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \)), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral contributes a factor of \( 2\pi \), so:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, substitute \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), which transforms the integral into:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

Reversing the limits of integration:

\[
-16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du \) diverges because \( \ln(u) \) approaches \( -\infty \) as \( u \to 0 \). This indicates that the total area is infinite. Since the pseudosphere corresponds to a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area, the result is consistent with the properties of negatively curved spaces.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere is \( +\infty \).
