Okay, I'm trying to answer this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But wait, which symmetries exactly must all operators respect?

The question lists four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincaré, CP, and CPT. I need to figure out which of these are required for all operators in SMEFT.

I think Lorentz symmetry is definitely one. Because the SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, right? All the operators must transform properly under Lorentz transformations. So operators are constructed from fields that are Lorentz scalars. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) must be respected.

What about Poincaré symmetry? Wait, Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Oh, right, the Poincaré group is the combination of Lorentz and translation symmetries. So if the theory is Poincaré invariant, it must also be Lorentz invariant. But do the individual operators in SMEFT have to respect Poincaré symmetry?

Wait, when you write down the SMEFT Lagrangian, it's constructed to be invariant under the Poincaré group. So all the operators must be Poincaré invariant. Because the whole Lagrangian is, and each term (operator) must be invariant under both Lorentz and translation. So the SMEFT operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. The Poincaré symmetry would imply that the operators are invariant under translations, which means that the coefficients (which are part of the operators) aren't changing. But how does that apply to the operators themselves? Maybe the operators are built in such a way that they are Poincaré invariant. So both 1 and 2 are correct, so the operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetry.

Then, what about the other options, CP and CPT? I remember that the Standard Model is symmetric under CPT. SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it should also respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model. So CPT symmetry is a requirement because it's part of the Standard Model's framework. But CP symmetry? The Standard Model doesn't have a CP symmetry, except for some specific cases. Wait, no, the SM is not CP symmetric because of the CKM problem, but the effective theory must respect the same symmetries as the SM, right?

Wait, no. SMEFT is an effective theory, built to include all possible operators that are allowed by the symmetries of the Standard Model. So the operators must respect the same symmetry as the SM. The SM has CPT symmetry, but not CP or T individually. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. However, do they have to respect CP symmetry? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the question is which symmetries MUST be respected by all operators. So, the SMEFT is a Poincaré-invariant and Lorentz-invariant theory. It must also respect CPT symmetry because the SM does. But CP isn't necessarily a symmetry of the SMEFT because the SM doesn't have it. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP, but they must respect CPT. So operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincaré (2), and CPT (4).

Wait, but the options don't have a 1,2,4. Looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4 (which would be Lorentz, Poincare, CPT). Option D is 1,3,4 (Lorentz, CP, CPT).

Wait, but Poincare includes Lorentz. Oh, wait, no. The question lists the options as separate symmetries. So each operator must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT?

Wait, no. Because Lorentz is a subset of Poincare. So if an operator is Poincare invariant, it's automatically Lorentz invariant. So the fact that the operator must respect Lorentz is already implied by Poincare. But the question lists them as separate options. Hmm.

Wait, the question asks which symmetries must be respected. So if an operator must be Poincare-invariant, then it's automatically Lorentz-invariant, but the question requires which of the four must be respected. So both 1 and 2 are needed because they are separate symmetries. Or perhaps they are not separate symmetries. Because Poincare includes Lorentz.

Wait, no. Poincare symmetry is a larger symmetry group that includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question lists Lorentz and Poincare as separate options. So perhaps the operator must respect both? No, because if it's Poincare-invariant, Lorentz is already part of that. So perhaps the correct answer is that operators must respect Poincare (so both Lorentz and translations are included), but the question lists Lorentz as a separate option.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is that the question is about the symmetries that the operators must individually respect. So the operators must be Lorentz scalars, meaning they must transform correctly under Lorentz transformations. Do they also have to respect Poincare symmetry?

Wait, no. Because each operator is a local operator in the Lagrangian, and the entire Lagrangian is Poincare-invariant. So the individual operators don't need to be Poincare-invariant on their own; they just combine to form a Poincare-invariant Lagrangian. Wait, no, because each term in the Lagrangian must be a scalar under Poincare. So each operator must be a Poincare scalar, which includes being a Lorentz scalar and having the right behavior under translations.

Wait, but how about translations? For example, a scalar operator would involve fields and their derivatives, which are arranged such that the operator is Lorentz-invariant and also translation-invariant. So in that sense, each operator must respect Lorentz and translation symmetries, i.e., Poincare.

So operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz and translations. So in the options, if 2 is correct, then 1 is automatically correct because 2 includes 1. But the question asks which symmetries must be respected. So both 1 and 2 are correct because they are part of the larger symmetry. But perhaps the question doesn't consider them as a single symmetry but as separate.

Alternatively, maybe the SMEFT operators must be invariant under Lorentz and Poincare, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Another angle: SMEFT maintains the same gauge symmetry as the Standard Model, but what about other symmetries? I think the SMEFT is constructed such that all operators are Poincaré and gauge invariant. So Lorentz and Poincare symmetries must be respected.

What about CPT symmetry? The SMEFT must respect CPT because it's part of the Standard Model's symmetries. So operators must respect CPT. But for CP symmetry, the SMEFT can include operators that violate CP because the SM already has CP violation (like in the CKM matrix), so the effective theory allows operators that break CP.

Wait, no. The SMEFT must include all possible operators that are compatible with the SM symmetries. The SM has CPT symmetry, but not necessarily CP. So the SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry, but not necessarily CP. So operators can violate CP, but must respect CPT.

So operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the correct options are 1,2,4.

Looking back at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the answer would be C). But wait, let's check if all operators must respect Poincare symmetry.

Wait, in the SMEFT, the operators are local, so each operator must be a Lorentz scalar and a Poincare scalar. Therefore, each operator must individually be invariant under Lorentz and translation. So operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare.

Wait, but Lorentz is a subset of Poincare. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So why are 1 and 2 both correct?

But the question is phrased as "must be respected by all operators". So for each operator, it must be invariant under Lorentz, and under Poincare. But since Poincare requires both Lorentz and translation, perhaps the correct answer is that operators must respect Poincare (so including Lorentz). But the question lists Lorentz and Poincare as separate options. So perhaps the correct answer is that operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries, along with CPT.

Wait, but in the options, 1 and 2 are both correct, and 4 is correct. So that's three symmetries: 1,2,4. So the correct option is C.

But let me think again. The Poincare group includes Lorentz and translations. So if an operator is Poincare-invariant, it's automatically Lorentz-invariant. So the question is, does each operator have to respect both Lorentz and Poincare, or is Poincare the higher symmetry that encompasses Lorentz?

The question lists both as separate options. So for each operator, they must respect Lorentz symmetry, and they must also respect Poincare symmetry. But perhaps the correct answer is that Poincare is a larger symmetry, so if an operator respects Poincare, it's already respecting Lorentz.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of each symmetry separately. The SMEFT operators must be Lorentz scalars. So symmetry 1 must be respected. Also, the entire theory must be Poincare-invariant, so the operators must be part of a Poincare-invariant Lagrangian. So each operator must be a scalar under Poincare. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

Wait, no. Because Poincare includes Lorentz. So in reality, the operator must respect Poincare symmetry, which implies they also respect Lorentz symmetry. So if an operator is Poincare-invariant, it automatically is Lorentz-invariant. So in that case, including both 1 and 2 is redundant, but the question lists them as separate options. So maybe the correct answer is that the operators must respect Poincare (2) and CPT (4), but I'm not sure about Lorentz.

Wait, no. The question is which symmetries must each operator respect. So each operator must transform as a scalar under Lorentz (symmetry 1) and under Poincare (symmetry 2). So both are required. So the correct answer includes both 1 and 2.

Then, about CPT (4). The SMEFT must respect CPT because the underlying SM does. So all operators must be CPT-invariant. So 4 is correct.

So the operators must respect 1,2,4. So the correct option is C) 1,2,4.

Wait, but what about CP? The operators can violate CP symmetry because the SM already has CP violation. So symmetry 3 (CP) is not necessarily respected. So the answer is C, which includes 1,2,4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the requirements for the operators:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, meaning all operators must transform as Lorentz scalars. This ensures that the theory respects special relativity.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: The Poincaré group combines Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since SMEFT is constructed to be Poincaré-invariant, all operators must respect both Lorentz and translation symmetries. While Lorentz symmetry is a subset of Poincaré symmetry, the question lists them as separate options, so both must be considered.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model (SM) does not strictly respect CP symmetry due to phenomena like the CKM problem. Consequently, SMEFT allows operators that can violate CP symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM respects CPT symmetry, and SMEFT, being an effective field theory of the SM, must also respect CPT symmetry. Thus, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected, as operators in SMEFT can violate it.

**Correct Option**: C) 1, 2, 4.
