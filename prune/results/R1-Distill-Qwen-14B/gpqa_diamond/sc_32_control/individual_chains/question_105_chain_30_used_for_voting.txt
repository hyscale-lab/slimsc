Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Honestly, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how its brightness variations can mimic an exoplanet. So, the setup is that the star has a radius equal to the Sun, right? So Rstar is the same as the Sun's radius. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotty, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness changes. This is similar to how an exoplanet transiting in front of the star would block some light, causing a dip in brightness.

The question is asking: what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, to produce the same amplitude in the light curve as this spotted star? So, we're comparing the brightness variation caused by the spots to the variation caused by a planet transit.

Hmm. So first, I think I need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots. Then, compare that to the amplitude that would be caused by a planet of a certain radius.

Let me jot down what I know:

- Rstar = R_sun (so Rstar = 1 R_sun, but maybe in actual numbers, it's about 7e5 km or 695,700 km? Not sure if I'll need the exact number, but perhaps it's given in terms of the star's radius.)
- Filling factor (f) = 20% = 0.2. So 20% of one hemisphere is covered in spots. Wait, but the hemisphere is half the star, so the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) * 2? Wait, no. Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the surface that's covered by spots. But in this case, it's one hemisphere. So if the star's surface is 4π R², but one hemisphere (2π R²) has 20% spots. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, or is the filling factor 20% of the entire star's surface? The question says, "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Hmm. So perhaps it's 20% of the hemisphere. So the area of spots is 0.2 * (π R²) = 0.2 π R²? Because the hemisphere is a spherical cap, area is 2π R² (wait, no, the area of a hemisphere is 2π R² when considering a full sphere, but the surface area of a hemisphere is 2π R², like for Earth's northern hemisphere). Wait, no, wait. The total surface area of a sphere is 4π R². A hemisphere would be 2π R². So if the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, then the area with spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, but the star is being observed, and as it rotates, the spots come into view. So when the star is viewed face-on, the entire hemisphere is visible, but when it's edge-on, only a part is visible. But the problem says it's only one hemisphere that's spotty, so during rotation, the spots come in and out of the field of view.

But perhaps the key is to calculate the change in brightness when the spots are visible versus when they're not. So the brightness variation is due to the spots being either in the observed hemisphere or not.

Wait, no. Since the star's rotation brings the spots into view. So when the side with the spots is facing us, the observed brightness will dip because the spots are cooler and emit less light.

But wait, the star emits light based on its temperature and area. The spots are cooler, so when they're on the facing hemisphere, the total emitted light is less than when they're on the far side.

So the variation in brightness (ΔF) would be the difference between when the spots are in view and when they're not.

Wait, but how does the star's rotation affect this? Since only one hemisphere is spotty, the spots will come into view as the star rotates. So the maximum brightness occurs when the spots are on the far side, and the minimum when they're on the near side. The variation is the difference between these two.

Alternatively, when the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute less flux. When the star rotates 180 degrees, the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, so the flux is higher. So the variation in brightness is the difference between these two.

So to calculate the brightness variation, I need to find the change in the star's total flux when the spotty region is visible compared to when it's not.

The star's total flux without spots is F0 = 4π Rstar² σ Teff^4. Wait, no. Because the star emits according to its surface area and temperature. The flux is F = σ Teff^4, but the total power is L = 4π R² σ Teff^4. So the total flux from the entire star is L = 4π Rstar² σ (6000 K)^4.

But when parts of the star are cooler, the flux decreases. The spots have a temperature of Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

So the flux from a spot is F_spot = σ (5000)^4. The flux from the non-spot area is F_non_spot = σ (6000)^4.

But the area of the spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2π Rstar² = 0.4 π Rstar².

Wait, no. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So if the hemisphere's area is 2π R², 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

But wait, earlier I thought about the filling factor being 0.2 of the entire star's surface, but the question says the hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%—so perhaps the spots are 20% of the hemisphere, not of the whole star. So area with spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, but the star's surface is 4π R². So the area of spots is 0.4 π R², which is 10% of the star's total surface area.

But the star is rotating such that the spotty hemisphere is either facing us or not. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the side we see. When it's not, the spots are on the far side.

Wait, but the star's rotation period would cause the spots to come into and out of view. The maximum brightness would be when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when the spotty hemisphere is facing us.

But to compute the brightness variation, I think we need to calculate the difference in flux between these two scenarios.

Let me model the star as a sphere with a certain hemisphere covered in spots. When the star is viewed with the spotty hemisphere facing us, the flux is F_spotty = (non-spot area flux) + (spot area flux).

Similarly, when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, F_non_spotty = (non-spot area flux) + (spot area flux? Wait, no. If the spotty hemisphere is on the back, then the front hemisphere doesn't have any spots. So in that case, the front is all non-spots.

Wait, no—wait, the star's surface is either in the front (visible) or back. The spotty hemisphere is only on one side. So when the spotty side is facing us, the spots are on the front; when it's not, the front is all non-spotty.

So, when the spotty hemisphere is facing us:

Flux = (area of non-spots on front) × F_non_spot + (area of spots on front) × F_spot.

Wait, but the front hemisphere has both spots and non-spots. The area of the front hemisphere is 2π R². Of that, 0.2 is covered by spots (filling factor 20% of front hemisphere), so the area of spots on front is 0.2 × 2π R² = 0.4 π R². The non-spot area on front is 2π R² - 0.4 π R² = 1.6 π R².

So the flux when spotty hemisphere is visible:

F_spotty = (1.6 π R²) × σ (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R²) × σ (5000)^4.

When the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us (i.e., the spotty hemisphere is on the back), the front is entirely non-spotty:

F_non_spotty = (2 π R²) × σ (6000)^4.

So the difference in flux between these two is ΔF = F_non_spotty - F_spotty.

But wait, the star is being observed for rotational modulation, so the brightness variation is the change between when the spotty hemisphere is visible and when it's not. So the amplitude is (F_non_spotty - F_spotty) / F_non_spotty × 100%, perhaps, but for our purposes, we just need the ratio.

Alternatively, let's compute (F_non_spotty - F_spotty) / F_non_spotty to find the fractional change.

Wait another approach: compute the fractional change in flux due to the spots.

But perhaps there's a simpler way. The idea is that the star's flux when the spots are visible is F_spotty, and without them (when the other hemisphere is visible) is F_non_spotty. The amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between these two divided by the star's flux when there are no spots (F_non_spotty), or when the spots are on the far side.

Wait, but the spots themselves are causing a dip in brightness when they're on the front. So the maximum flux is F_non_spotty, and the minimum is F_spotty. So the amplitude is (F_non_spotty - F_spotty) / F_non_spotty.

Let me compute that.

Compute F_non_spotty:

F_non_spotty = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

Compute F_spotty:

F_spotty = (2π R² - 0.2 * 2π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.2 * 2π R²) * σ (5000)^4.

Wait, no. The front has 20% spots. So F_spotty = (area_non_spots_front) * F_non_spot + (area_spots_front) * F_spot.

Area_non_spots_front = 0.8 * 2π R² = 1.6 π R².

Area_spots_front = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So F_spotty = (1.6 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R²) * σ (5000)^4.

So the difference is:

F_non_spotty - F_spotty = [2 π R² σ (6000)^4 ] - [1.6 π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4 ]

= [ (2 - 1.6) π R² σ (6000)^4 ] - 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4 ]

= (0.4 π R² σ (6000)^4 ) - (0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4 )

Factor out 0.4 π R² σ:

= 0.4 π R² σ [ (6000)^4 - (5000)^4 ]

So the amplitude (delta F) is this difference.

Now, the fractional change is (delta F) / F_non_spotty.

Compute F_non_spotty:

F_non_spotty = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4.

So,

delta F / F_non_spotty = [0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / [2 π R² σ 6000^4 ]

Simplify:

= [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / [2 *6000^4 ]

= [0.4 (6^4 -5^4) ] / [ 2 *6^4 ] , since we can factor out 1000^4.

Wait, 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * (1e3)^4. Similarly, 5000^4 is 5^4 * 1e12.

But let's compute the numerical values.

Compute 6000^4 and 5000^4.

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = 5^4 * 1e12 = 625 * 1e12 = 6.25e14.

So,

6000^4 -5000^4 = 1.296e15 - 0.625e15 = 0.671e15 = 6.71e14.

So,

delta F / F_non_spotty = [0.4 * 6.71e14 ] / [ 2 * 1.296e15 ]

Compute numerator: 0.4 *6.71e14 = 2.684e14.

Denominator: 2 * 1.296e15 = 2.592e15.

So,

= 2.684e14 / 2.592e15 ≈ (2.684 / 25.92) ≈ approximately 0.1035, or about 10.35%.

Wait, that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio without using the 1e12 factor.

Wait, 6000 is 6 * 1000, 5000 is 5 *1000.

So,

(6000^4 -5000^4 ) = (6^4 -5^4 ) * (1000)^4.

= (1296 - 625) * 1e12 = 671 *1e12.

So,

delta F / F_non_spotty = [0.4 * 671 *1e12 ] / [2 * (6^4 *1e12) ]

= [0.4 *671 ] / [2 *1296 ]

Wait, let's compute that:

0.4 *671 = 268.4.

Denominator: 2 *1296 = 2592.

So, 268.4 / 2592 ≈ 0.10357, which is ~10.36%.

So the fractional change is about 10.36%. So the brightness variation is about 10.36% of the star's flux.

Wait, that's the amplitude of the brightness dip when the spotty hemisphere is facing us. So the maximum dip is about 10% of the star's flux.

Now, the question is, what would be the radius of a planet that would cause the same amplitude in the light curve? So, when the planet transits the star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip. The amplitude of that dip depends on the area of the planet relative to the star.

The formula for the transit depth is (R_planet / R_star)^2, assuming the planet is a perfect disk and the transit is edge-on.

Wait, yes. The fractional dip is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is π Rp², and the star's area is π Rstar². So the ratio is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So, we have the dip from the spots as 10.36%, which is 0.1036.

We need to find Rp such that (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1036.

Wait, but wait. The dip from the planet would be (Rp/Rstar)^2 * (F_non_spotty) / F_non_spotty, right? Because the planet is blocking light, so the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

But in this case, the dip from the spots is about 10.36%, so the planet's dip should be the same: (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1036.

So,

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1036) ≈ sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.316, because sqrt(0.1)= approx 0.316. Alternatively, sqrt(0.1036) is a bit higher.

Wait, 0.32^2 is 0.1024, which is close to 0.1036. So Rp/Rstar would be approximately 0.32. Hmm. But let me compute it more accurately.

Compute sqrt(0.1036):

Let me think. 0.32^2 = 0.1024, as said. 0.322^2 = (0.32 +0.002)^2 = 0.32² + 2*0.32*0.002 + 0.002² = 0.1024 + 0.00128 + 0.000004 = 0.103684. Oh, that's almost 0.1036! So Rp/Rstar is about 0.322, which is approximately 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.32, and option A is ~0.39. So the correct answer would be D) ~0.32.

Wait, but wait a minute. The dip due to the spots is 10.36%, which is higher than the dip from a planet with Rpl/Rstar=0.32 (which causes a ~10.24% dip). So the answer would be approximately 0.32, which is option D.

But wait, the options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, the spot calculation gives a dip of about 10.36% in flux. So the planet dip should be the same, which would require (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1036, so Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1036) ≈ 0.322, which is approximately 0.32. So option D.

But wait, another thought: the brightness variation from the spots is when the star's brightness goes from F_non_spotty (when no spots are visible) to F_spotty (when spots are visible). So the dip is (F_non_spotty - F_spotty) / F_non_spotty ≈ 10.36%.

But the planet's dip is when a part of the star is blocked. So the dip is (Area_planet / Area_star) * (F_non_spot / F_non_spot?), because the planet blocks some of the non-spotty regions.

Wait, no. The planet blocks part of the star's light. The star's total flux is F = σ Teff^4 * 4π Rstar². But when a planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's disk, regardless of whether that area is spotted or not. Wait no—because if the planet is covering a spotted area, then the dip would be smaller because the planet is blocking a cooler region. But in this problem, we're told to imagine that the star isn't covered by spots, so the planet's transit would only block the non-spotted (i.e., normal) starlight.

Wait, the question says: "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star?"

So, in the case where the star isn't spotted, the planet's transit would cause a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2, because the star is uniformly at Teff.

But in our problem, the star is spotted, so the dip is due to the change in the star's brightness as the spots rotate in and out of view.

So the dip caused by the planet, when the star isn't spotted, should be equal in amplitude to the dip caused by the spots.

So, the dip from the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2, and this must equal 0.1036.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1036) ≈ 0.322.

So the answer is D) ~0.32.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of \( f = 0.2 \).
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's total flux without spots is \( F_{\text{non-spotty}} = 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \).
   - When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is reduced due to the cooler spots:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotty}} = (1 - f) \cdot 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 + f \cdot 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma T_{\text{spots}}^4
     \]
   - The brightness variation amplitude is:
     \[
     \Delta F = F_{\text{non-spotty}} - F_{\text{spotty}}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{non-spotty}}} = \frac{(1 - f) \cdot T_{\text{eff}}^4 - f \cdot T_{\text{spots}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4}
     \]

3. **Calculation**:
   - Substituting \( f = 0.2 \), \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \):
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{non-spotty}}} = \frac{(1 - 0.2) \cdot 6000^4 - 0.2 \cdot 5000^4}{6000^4}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{non-spotty}}} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 6000^4 - 0.2 \cdot 5000^4}{6000^4}
     \]
   - Compute \( 6000^4 \) and \( 5000^4 \):
     \[
     6000^4 = 1.296 \times 10^{15}, \quad 5000^4 = 6.25 \times 10^{14}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{non-spotty}}} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 1.296 \times 10^{15} - 0.2 \cdot 6.25 \times 10^{14}}{1.296 \times 10^{15}}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{non-spotty}}} = \frac{1.0368 \times 10^{15} - 1.25 \times 10^{14}}{1.296 \times 10^{15}}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{non-spotty}}} \approx 0.1036 \, \text{(or 10.36%)}.
     \]

4. **Exoplanet Comparison**:
   - The brightness variation caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to \( (R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}})^2 \).
   - To match the amplitude of \( 0.1036 \), we solve:
     \[
     (R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}})^2 = 0.1036
     \]
     \[
     R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}} = \sqrt{0.1036} \approx 0.322
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.32 \). This corresponds to **Option D**.
