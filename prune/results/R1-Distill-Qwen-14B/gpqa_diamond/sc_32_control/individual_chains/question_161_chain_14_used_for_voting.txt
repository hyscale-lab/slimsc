Okay, so I've got this question about a transmission electron microscope setup. Let me try to break it down. So Mike is working on a high-res TEM operating at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, which is like less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to minimize gas molecules because that improves electron microscopy by reducing scattering and other issues.

But even with that vacuum, some gas particles are still there, and mass spectrometer detected them. Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the volume of the compartment. Pressure is low because it's a vacuum, so I remember that when pressure is lower, the mean free path is longer. Because in a vacuum, the gas molecules don't hit each other as much, so they can travel further before a collision.

But then Mike starts the electron beam, and he notices something odd. The mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2. And the temperature is the same, so that can't be the reason. So why would the mean free path change?

Wait, the mean free path is usually calculated based on the gas's properties—like pressure, temperature, and the diameter of the gas molecules. The formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the molecule diameter, and P is pressure. So if the pressure changes, λ changes. But in this case, the pressure is already ultra-low, but maybe the electron beam is affecting it somehow.

Hmm, when the electron beam is on, it's a high-energy beam. High-energy electrons can interact with the gas molecules. One possibility is that the beam's energy causes the gas molecules to heat up. If the gas gets heated, the temperature increases. But wait, the problem says the sample compartment's temperature remained the same. So maybe the gas molecules themselves are getting hotter because of the beam. Oh, but wait, the overall temperature of the compartment is the same, but the gas could have a higher local temperature due to electron interactions.

Alternatively, the electron beam could cause the gas to ionize. If the gas is ionized, the mean free path might change. Because charged particles (ions) would behave differently. They could interact more or less with the electrons in the beam, but how does that affect the mean free path of the gas molecules?

Wait, the mean free path is about how far a molecule travels before colliding with another. But if the gas is ionized, the effective collisions might change. Or maybe the ions are more likely to stick to the walls or other surfaces, thus changing the effective pressure, but the overall pressure might not change because it's a vacuum. Hmm.

Alternatively, another factor is electron scattering. When the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving through the vacuum and hit the gas molecules. Each time an electron scatters off a gas molecule, it's like a collision. But wait, the mean free path we're talking about here is for the gas molecules, right? Or is it for the electrons?

Wait the question says: Mike found that the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules was no longer λ1, but λ2. So the mean free path for the electrons? Or for the gas molecules? Wait, the initial determination of λ1 was for the gas molecules, I think. But when the beam is on, it's the electrons that are scattering off the gas molecules, which affects the electron's path.

Wait wait, the question says that upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path was λ2. But what is the mean free path in this context? The mean free path of the gas molecules, or the electrons?

Wait, the first part says Mike determined the mean free path of the gas molecules to be λ1. Then, when the beam is on, he observed the mean free path (for something) was λ2. Oh, but the question says he observed based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. So perhaps the mean free path of the electrons is now λ2. Because when the electrons are moving through the gas, the gas molecules cause scattering, which affects how far the electrons travel without scattering—so that's the electrons' mean free path.

Ah, okay, so initially, without the electron beam, the mean free path of the gas is λ1. But when the electrons are moving, their mean free path is λ2. So what's the relationship between λ1 and λ2?

Wait, the mean free path for electrons in the gas would be different because their interactions are different. The electrons are moving at a high speed, and they have a certain charge, so they might have different scattering mechanisms.

Wait, but the mean free path of the gas molecules is λ1. The mean free path of the electrons in the same gas would be something else. So Mike is now measuring the mean free path of the electrons, which would be λ2.

Wait, but how does the presence of gas affect the electron's mean free path? The electron mean free path is determined by how often it scatters off gas atoms. So in a lower pressure (ultra-high vacuum), the electron mean free path is longer. But if the gas pressure is the same (since the sample compartment's pressure hasn't changed), why would the electron mean free path be different?

Wait, but when the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas is being heated by the beam, increasing the gas temperature locally. Since λ is proportional to temperature (λ = kT/(...)), so if the temperature increases, λ increases. So if the gas in the beam's path is heated, the gas's mean free path (λ1) would increase, but wait, the question says the overall temperature remained the same, so maybe it's the gas's temperature in the beam spot that's higher.

Alternatively, the electron beam might cause ionization of the gas molecules, turning them into ions. So the gas is now partially ionized. How does ionization affect the mean free path of the electrons?

Wait, if the gas is ionized, the electrons are no longer free to move as they are attached to ions. Or wait, in a plasma state, free electrons and ions are present. But in a very low pressure, the plasma might not form, but perhaps the presence of ions affects the electron scattering.

Alternatively, when the gas is ionized, the electrons might have different cross-sections for scattering. Ions have a larger effective radius, perhaps, making the scattering more frequent. Or maybe the ions are more massive, leading to more energetic transfers during collisions.

Wait, but if the gas is ionized, perhaps the electron mean free path decreases because the electrons are now scattering not only from neutral gas atoms but also from ions, which might have a higher cross-section for scattering. So more scattering events would mean a shorter mean free path.

Wait, when the electron beam is on, the gas is ionized. So the gas molecules are either positive ions or free electrons. So the electrons in the beam would interact with these ions. How does that affect the scattering? Well, an ion has a larger effective size because it's got a positive charge, so the Coulomb force would make the scattering cross-section larger. So electrons would be more likely to scatter off ions, which are bigger targets.

So the electron mean free path would be shorter in this case. Because with a higher scattering rate, the electrons can't go as far before scattering.

But wait, the initial λ1 is the gas molecules' mean free path (distance between collisions for gas molecules). When the beam is on, the electrons' mean free path is λ2. So if the gas is ionized, the electrons have more frequent collisions, so their λ2 would be less than λ1, assuming λ1 is the gas's MFP.

Wait, no, because λ1 is the gas's MFP, and λ2 is the electron's MFP. So λ2 could be less than or greater than λ1, depending on the situation.

Alternatively, perhaps when the sample is under ultra-high vacuum, the electron mean free path is longer. Because the gas is at such a low pressure, the electrons don't collide much. But when the beam is on, perhaps the electron's own motion causes more ionization or heating, which might lead to more scattering.

Wait, but in ultra-high vacuum, the electron mean free path is already very long. But when the beam is on, if any gas is present, the electrons will scatter off the gas molecules. So the presence of gas (even small amount) causes the electron's mean free path to be shorter than if the vacuum was perfect.

Wait, but Mike already had some gas in the compartment, so the mean free path λ1 was for the gas molecules. Now, when the beam is on, perhaps the gas's presence doesn't change, but the electron's mean free path is shorter (λ2 < λ1), because the electrons are interacting with the gas.

Wait, but the question says that the mean free path of the gas molecules is λ1, and when the beam is on, the mean free path (of the gas) is now λ2. Or wait, perhaps the question is talking about the mean free path of the gas as experienced by the electrons. No, the question says: "... based on electron scattering with the gas molecules." So I think the mean free path in question is that of the electrons. So initially, without the beam, the gas's MFP is λ1. When the beam is on, the electrons' MFP is λ2. So why would these be different?

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to be more ionized, which affects the scattering of the electrons. If the gas is ionized, the electrons have more targets to scatter off (ions have larger cross-sections), leading to a shorter mean free path for the electrons. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

Wait, but λ1 is the mean free path of the gas molecules. The electron's MFP would be a different value. Let me think: in a vacuum, the electron's MFP would be determined by the gas pressure. At a very low pressure, the mean free path for electrons would be longer. So if the gas pressure is same, λ_e (electron MFP) would be same as the gas MFP? Or not.

Wait, the mean free path for gas molecules is based on their collision with each other. The mean free path for electrons is based on their collision with the gas molecules. So the same gas pressure would lead to different MFPs for the electrons and the gas molecules.

Wait, but the question says that initially, Mike calculated λ1 as the mean free path of the gas molecules. Then, when the electron beam is on, he found that the mean free path (as experienced by the electrons) was λ2.

Hmm, but the problem statement says Mike found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1. So he's comparing the mean free path based on electron scattering, which is λ2, to the initial λ1. So he notices that λ2 is different.

But why would the MFP of the electrons be different? Because when the beam is off, the gas is just sitting there, and the mean free path of the gas is λ1. But when the beam is on, the electrons are moving, and the gas's presence causes scattering, but perhaps the gas is being heated or ionized, which affects the electron scattering.

Wait, another possibility is that when the beam is on, the gas is being heated, which increases its temperature locally. Since the mean free path of the gas (λ1) is calculated based on temperature, but the beam might be causing a temperature rise, which would increase λ1. However, the problem states that the sample compartment's temperature remained the same, so perhaps the overall temperature isn't changing, but the gas in the electron's path is heated.

If that's the case, the gas's temperature in the beam's vicinity is higher, so the mean free path (λ) would increase. But Mike's initial λ1 was based on the overall temperature, so perhaps λ2 (gas's MFP) would be higher than λ1. But that's not matching the options given.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam doesn't directly affect the gas's temperature enough, but Mike is observing the electron's mean free path. So the gas's presence causes the electron's MFP to be shorter. So λ2 would be smaller than λ1.

Wait, but why would λ2 be equal to λ1? Or maybe the electron's MFP is longer. Wait, because the gas pressure is very low, the electron's MFP is longer than the gas's MFP. Because the gas's MFP is the average distance between gas molecule collisions, while the electron's MFP is the average distance an electron travels before scattering off a gas molecule.

So when the gas pressure is lower, the electron's MFP is longer than the gas's MFP. So λ_e = (some factor) * λ_gas.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think of the formulas.

The mean free path for gas molecules (λ_gas) is given by:

λ_gas = (k * T) / (sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * P)

Where d is the diameter of the gas molecule, P is pressure.

The mean free path for electrons (λ_e) would depend on their velocity and the scattering cross-section with gas atoms.

The electron mean free path can be approximated by:

λ_e = (γ * m_e) / (π * σ * P)

Where γ is the electron velocity, m_e is mass, σ is the scattering cross-section, P is pressure.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, the electron mean free path is inversely proportional to the product of the gas density and the scattering cross-section.

But given that the pressure is the same, and the gas density is low, the electron's mean free path would be longer than the gas's mean free path, because the electrons are moving much faster and have a smaller effective cross-section for scattering (since electrons are much lighter and faster, but their charge might influence the cross-section).

Wait, but in a perfect vacuum, the electron's MFP would be infinite. So in a very high vacuum, the MFP for the gas is λ1, and the electron's MFP would be much longer than λ1.

But wait, in the initial state (beam off), the MFP of the gas is λ1. But when the beam is on, the gas is interacting with the electrons, which could cause the gas to be more ionized. Or maybe the electrons' presence causes the gas to heat, affecting the gas's MFP.

Alternatively, the primary effect is that when the beam is turned on, the electrons interact with the gas, leading to more scattering events for the electrons. So the electron's MFP would be shorter, because they collide more frequently with the gas molecules.

Wait, but why would the electron's MFP be shorter than the gas's MFP? Because the gas's MFP is determined by their mutual collisions, while the electron's MFP is determined by how often they hit gas atoms.

Wait, perhaps the gas's mean free path λ1 is longer than the electron's mean free path λ2. Because the electrons are moving quickly and hit the gas atoms more frequently.

Wait, but that depends on the parameters. If the gas is at very low pressure, the gas's mean free path is large, and the electron's mean free path could be even larger or smaller, depending on their velocities and cross-sections.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron's mean free path is inversely proportional to their velocity times the gas density. So if the gas is at a very low pressure (density is low), the mean free path for the electrons would be longer. So λ_e is larger than λ_gas.

So when the beam is on, the electron's mean free path is λ2, which could be larger than λ1. But that would mean that the answer is λ2 is greater than λ1.

Wait, but the question says Mike found that the mean free path was no longer λ1, but λ2. So according to the options, the options are about whether λ2 is greater than, less than, or equal to λ1.

Looking at the options:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

B) λ2 = λ1, indicating an error in observation.

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1

Wait, I'm trying to think of the factors. Since the electron beam is on, the gas might be ionized, which would affect the electron's scattering. If the gas is ionized, perhaps the electrons have more opportunities to scatter, thereby reducing their mean free path. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam might cause the gas to become more ionized, making the gas's mean free path longer. Because the gas is ionized, the mean free path could change.

Wait, but the mean free path of the gas would depend on their own collisions. If the gas is ionized, the gas ions are bigger, so their mean free path would be shorter. Because collisions would be more frequent if they have a larger cross-section.

Wait, when a gas is partially ionized, the neutral molecules and ions are present. The ions have a larger effective diameter (due to their charge), so the mean free path for the gas (ions and neutrals) would decrease. So λ1 (initially for gas) would be longer than the new λ2 (gas's MFP when ionized). Or wait, no, because ionized gas (plasma) has different behavior; perhaps the mean free path increases because ions are more mobile, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ionization doesn't affect the gas's mean free path much, but the electron beam's presence changes the electron's mean free path.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently.

When the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving through the gas. The gas molecules (and any ions) cause the electrons to scatter. So the electron's mean free path is determined by how often they hit the gas atoms/ions.

The mean free path for electrons (λ_e) is given by:

λ_e = 1/(n * σ)

Where n is the number density of the gas, and σ is the scattering cross-section.

Initially, without the beam, the gas has a mean free path λ1, which is based on gas-gas collisions. But when the beam is on, the electron's mean free path λ2 is determined by gas-electron collisions.

So if the gas is at a certain pressure, the number density n is fixed. The cross-section σ for electron scattering depends on the properties of the gas.

Wait, but when the electron beam is present, the gas can become ionized. The presence of ions would change the scattering cross-section σ. For example, an ion has a larger charge, so the Coulomb force would make the scattering cross-section larger. So σ increases when the gas is ionized.

If σ increases, then λ_e = 1/(n σ) decreases. So λ2 would be less than λ1, assuming n remains the same.

But wait, what's λ1 compared to λ_e? If λ1 is the gas's MFP, which is (k*T)/(√2 π d² P), and λ_e is 1/(n σ), which could be a different value.

Wait, but if n is the same (since P is same), and σ increases due to ionization, then λ_e would decrease. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

So the conclusion is that λ2 < λ1.

Looking back at the options, option C is λ2 < λ1.

Alternatively, another angle: the gas's MFP (λ1) is for gas molecules colliding with each other. The electron's MFP (λ2) is for electrons colliding with gas molecules. Since the electrons are moving much faster, their MFP might be smaller or larger.

Wait, no: in a vacuum, if the gas is at pressure P, the number density n is proportional to P. The electron's MFP would be inversely proportional to n and σ.

But the gas's MFP depends on the same n, but a different cross-section for gas-gas collisions (d^2, where d is molecular diameter) and temperature.

But in reality, the electron's MFP could be significantly shorter if the scattering cross-section is larger.

Wait, but in the initial state, the gas's MFP is λ1. When the beam is on, the electron's MFP is λ2. If the gas is ionized, the cross-section for electron scattering becomes larger, so λ2 becomes smaller than λ1.

Therefore, the correct answer is C) λ2 < λ1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


When designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope, Mike achieved an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, minimizing gas molecules to reduce scattering and improve imaging. The mean free path of the gas molecules, denoted as $\lambda_1$, was determined based on factors like pressure, temperature, and molecular diameter. However, upon initiating the electron beam, Mike observed a change in the mean free path to $\lambda_2$, which was influenced by electron scattering with the gas molecules.

The mean free path of gas molecules ($\lambda_1$) is determined by gas-gas collisions, while the mean free path of electrons ($\lambda_2$) is influenced by their interactions with the gas. When the electron beam is on, the gas molecules may become ionized due to interactions with the high-energy electrons. Ionization increases the effective cross-section for electron scattering because ions have larger effective sizes and charge, leading to more frequent scattering events. This results in a shorter mean free path for the electrons compared to the gas's mean free path.

Thus, $\lambda_2$ (electron mean free path) is shorter than $\lambda_1$ (gas mean free path) under these conditions. The correct conclusion is that $\lambda_2 < \lambda_1$.
