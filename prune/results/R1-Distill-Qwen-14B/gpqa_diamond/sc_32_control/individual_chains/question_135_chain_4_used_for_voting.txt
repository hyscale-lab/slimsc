Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about particle decays, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says.

The problem gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as:

L(y) = -λf f̄(y) (ν + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that correctly. Oh, right, the notation might be a bit tricky. So, the interaction term is -λ times something. I think it's something like the fermion fields interacting with the boson X. The term has f and f-bar, which are the fermion fields, multiplied by X.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact structure. Let me think—Lagrangian terms are usually something like a coupling constant times interaction terms. So, for a Yukawa interaction, it's often like λ ψ ψ X, where ψ are fermion fields, but here I see f and f-bar multiplied by X. Oh, wait, maybe f is the fermion type? Like maybe it's a Yukawa coupling where X couples to fermions f.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

So, I need to find which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into. For a decay to be allowed, the total energy must be at least the sum of the rest masses of the decay products. Since X is a boson with mass 6 GeV, it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs where each fermion has a mass less than half of 6 GeV, which is 3 GeV. Because the rest mass of each must be less than or equal to 3 GeV to allow the decay.

Wait, wait, no. The total mass of the two particles has to be less than or equal to the mass of X. So each fermion's mass must be less than or equal to 3 GeV, because m_fermion * 2 must be <= m_X. So each fermion's mass must be <= 3 GeV.

So, which fermions have masses below or equal to 3 GeV? Let's list the known fermion masses.

Electron: ~0.0005 GeV
Muon: ~0.1057 GeV
Tau: ~1.777 GeV
Up quark: around 2 MeV (so ~0.002 GeV)
Down quark: about 4-5 MeV (~0.004-0.005 GeV)
Charm quark: ~1.27 GeV
Strange quark: ~95-100 MeV (~0.095-0.1 GeV)
Bottom quark: ~4.5-5 GeV
Top quark: way too heavy, around 173 GeV.

Wait, but wait: for each quark flavor, their masses are in the ranges I just listed. But wait, in reality, the mass of the quarks are current quark masses. For example, the up and down are light, the strange is a bit heavier, charm is heavier, and so on.

So, for the fermions that X can decay into, their masses must be less than 3 GeV. So, let's check each fermion pair.

E+ E-: Electrons are super light, so yes, they can be produced. Similarly for muons, taus.

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm. Their masses are all below 3 GeV. Wait, but wait: the charm quark's mass is around 1.27 GeV. So, for a pair of charm quarks, 2 * 1.27 = 2.54 GeV, which is less than 6. So, X can decay to c c-bar.

Same for up and down: their masses are negligible. So X can decay to u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar, as well as the leptons e e+, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-.

But wait, what about the bottom quark? The mass is about 4.5 GeV. So 2 * 4.5 = 9 GeV, which is way above 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar.

Similarly, top quarks are way too heavy. So the possible fermion pairs are e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but X can't decay into b b-bar because 2*m_b is about 9 GeV which is more than X's mass of 6 GeV. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So this includes c c-bar, which is allowed because 2*1.27 ~2.54 GeV <6. The others are all allowed. So B includes everything except b and t.

Wait, but looking at the option B, it's listed as c c-bar, s s, u u, d d, tau, mu, e. So that seems correct.

Option C includes t t-bar, which is impossible. So option C is out.

Option D includes b and others. So D includes b, which is not allowed.

Wait, but wait: looking back at the options:

Option B: X→ c c-bar, s s, u u, d d, tau, mu, e.

But let me check if tau is allowed. Tau mass is about 1.777 GeV, so 2tau would be ~3.55 GeV <6 GeV. So yes, tau can be produced.

So the allowed decays are any fermion pair where each fermion has mass <=3 GeV. So for quarks, that's u, d, s, c. For leptons, e, mu, tau.

So the correct decay channels would include all these.

Looking at the options:

Option B includes all the allowed ones except t and b. So option B is correct.

Wait, but the options may have more, but let me check each option.

Option A: Includes b. Not possible.

Option B: All quarks up to c and all leptons except maybe the tau. Wait, no—tau is included. So option B includes everything except t and b.

Option D includes b, which isn't allowed, so no.

So the correct answer should be option B.

But wait, wait: the Lagrangian given is -λ f f-bar (ν + X) ψ_f. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the Lagrangian, but I think that's a Yukawa interaction term. The interaction term would be something like λ X ψ ψ, so X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs.

So the coupling is to all the fermions, but their masses (or the cutoff) is determined by whether their mass is less than X's mass/2.

So the possible decay channels are all the fermion-antifermion pairs where each fermion has mass m ≤ 3 GeV.

So the possible pairs are:

e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar.

So, in the options, which one lists all these?

Looking at option B: X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's all the possible ones. So option B is correct.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction between \( X \) and fermions is described by the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) \left(\nu + X(y)\right) \psi_f(y),
\]

where \( X \) couples to fermion-antifermion pairs. For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the total mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of \( X \). Since \( X \) has a mass of 6 GeV, each fermion \( f \) must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), or \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

The known fermion masses are as follows:
- Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 0.1057 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 0.002 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

From these, the fermions \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \) have masses \( \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \), making their corresponding fermion-antifermion pairs kinematically allowed for \( X \to f \bar{f} \). The bottom (\( b \)) and top (\( t \)) quarks are too heavy, as \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 2m_t > 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decay channels for \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
