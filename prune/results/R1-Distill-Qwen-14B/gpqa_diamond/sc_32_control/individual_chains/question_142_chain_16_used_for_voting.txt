Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The density matrix given is rho equals one half times (|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's the density matrix for a completely mixed state. Because |0><0| is the projector for state |0>, and same for |1>. Adding them and scaling by 1/2 gives equal probability for both states, so it's a mixed state with maximum entropy.

Now, the question is about where this density matrix is located geometrically in the qubits space. Wait, qubits are two-level systems, so their space is represented as a Bloch sphere, right? The Bloch sphere is a way to represent all possible states of a qubit. Each point on the surface corresponds to a pure state, and the interior represents mixed states.

Density matrices for mixed states can be represented as points inside the Bloch sphere. The position is determined by the expectation values with the Pauli matrices, I think. So, the general form for a density matrix is (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. The vector r determines the position on the Bloch sphere.

Let me write down the given rho: (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let's expand that. |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So rho is (1/2) * I, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix.

Wait, wait. So rho equals I/2. Hmm. Now, in the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix can be written as (I + x X + y Y + z Z)/2, where X, Y, Z are the Pauli matrices, and x, y, z are the components of r. So for our case, rho is I/2. That means all the coefficients x, y, z must be zero. Because I/2 would correspond to (I + 0X + 0Y + 0Z)/2. So the vector r is (0,0,0).

Wait, but the origin in the Bloch sphere is the completely mixed state. Because the density matrix I/2 is the maximally mixed state, which is the center of the Bloch sphere. So the point would be at the origin, right?

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So that's the correct answer.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state, as it assigns equal probability to both the \(\left|0\right\rangle\) and \(\left|1\right\rangle\) states. In the Bloch sphere representation, which is used to geometrically describe the space of qubit states, the position of a density matrix corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\). 

For the given density matrix, expanding \(\rho\) shows that it simplifies to \(\frac{1}{2} I\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix. This implies that the coefficients of the Pauli matrices \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\) are all zero. Therefore, the vector \(r\) in the Bloch sphere representation is \((0,0,0)\), corresponding to the origin. The origin in the Bloch sphere represents the maximally mixed state, which matches the given density matrix.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix is:

**A) \(r=(1,1,0)\)**  
**B) \(r=(0,0,1)\)**  
**C) \(r=(0,0,0)\)**  
**D) \(r=(1,1,1)\)**  

The correct answer is **C**, as the density matrix corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Answer: C
