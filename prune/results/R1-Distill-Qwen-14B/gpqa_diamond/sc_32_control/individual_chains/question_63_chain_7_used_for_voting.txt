Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking about the momentum of a photon that would cause the molecule to switch from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state. So, it's about transitions between energy levels in a diatomic molecule, right?

Alright, let me read the details again. The molecule is diatomic, made of elements X and Y. The masses are given: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms. The angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, the model used here is the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. I remember that in the rigid rotor model, the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid one allows for some stretching, which connects rotational and vibrational energies.

In the fundamental state, I think that refers to the lowest energy state of the system. So, the molecule is in its ground state, and we're to find the photon momentum needed to transition it to the next state.

Wait, but in such models, the energy levels have both rotational and vibrational parts. So the fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0 or perhaps J=1?), but I'm not exactly sure about that. Maybe the fundamental state is the lowest energy, so both v=0 and J=0.

When the molecule absorbs a photon, it transitions to a higher energy state. The next lowest state would probably involve either an increase in vibrational or rotational energy. But since the model is the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of both, so the transition could be a vibrational excitation, a rotational one, or a combination.

Wait, but the question says 'the next state with the lowest possible energy.' So, perhaps it's the smallest possible increase in energy. That would probably be the next vibrational state, because each vibrational quantum jump is a larger energy increment than rotational. Or wait, no, sometimes the energy spacing for rotation can be smaller than vibrations, but I'm not so sure.

Wait, let me think. The vibrational energy levels are quantized with spacing of ħω, while rotational energy levels are spaced by (ħ²/(2I)) (2J+1), where I is the moment of inertia. So, the spacing between rotational levels depends on J, but it's generally smaller than the vibrational spacing. So, perhaps the next state would be a vibrational transition, but maybe the photon needs to supply energy for both a vibrational and rotational change.

Wait, wait, but the question says 'switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy'. So, I think the next state would be the first possible higher state, which would be the next vibrational state (v=1?), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is in a state that can transition to the next higher state by either increasing J (rotational) or v (vibrational). Since the question says 'lowest possible energy', perhaps the photon needs to be just enough to move to the next state, which would be the next vibrational state, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, no, perhaps the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next state would be the first excited state, which could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. But which is lower in energy?

Hmm, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. B is calculated as ħ²/(2I), and I is the moment of inertia.

The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) ħω + ħω v, where v is the vibrational quantum number (0,1,2,...). So the ground state is v=0, and the first excited vibrational state is v=1.

So the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is ħω. The energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_rot = B (1*(1+1) - 0) = 2B.

Which of these is smaller? Let's compute both.

First, calculate B. I is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass. So let's find μ.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) = (40) / 22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert that to kg. Since 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ R² = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

B is ħ²/(2I). Let's compute ħ. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J s. ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J s.

So ħ² is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

Then B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.2064e-46) ≈ (1.112e-68) / (2.4128e-46) ≈ 4.61e-23 J.

Wait, no: B is ħ²/(2I), so I have I = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

So B = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.2064e-46) = (1.112e-68) / (2.4128e-46) ≈ 4.61e-23 J.

Hmm, but wait, that seems large. Wait, wait, what is the rotational energy level spacing?

The energy for each rotational level is E_rot = B J (J+1), so the difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = B*(1)(2) - 0 = 2B.

So 2B would be 9.22e-23 J. What about the vibrational energy difference, which is ħ w.

w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So ħ w = (1.05457e-34 J s) * 4e14 rad/s ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

So the vibrational energy difference (v=0 to v=1) is about 4.218e-20 J, while the rotational (J=0 to J=1) is 9.22e-23 J.

Wait, so the rotational transition requires less energy? Because 9e-23 is less than 4e-20? Oh, wait, no, 4e-20 is bigger than 9e-23. So, the vibrational transition requires more energy than the rotational one.

Wait, so the question is about moving to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So which transition requires less energy: from J=0 to J=1, or from v=0 to v=1.

Looking at the numbers, the rotational transition (J=0→1) requires ~9e-23 J, which is less than the vibrational transition. So the photon would need to supply 9e-23 J to cause a rotational transition, or 4e-20 J for the vibrational. So the lower energy transition is the rotational one.

Wait, but wait, in the quantum rotation-vibration model, do transitions occur between rotational and vibrational states, or can they be either? Or, perhaps the molecule is in the (v=0, J=0) state, and the next possible state is (v=0, J=1), which is lower in energy than (v=1, J=0), because the rotational energy increment is smaller.

So the minimal energy change would be the rotational transition. So the photon would need to supply the energy difference for the J=0→1 transition.

So the energy required is 2B, which is 9.22e-23 J.

But wait, the question asks about the momentum of the photon. So I need to relate the energy of the photon to its momentum.

Photon energy E_photon = pc, where p is momentum and c is the speed of light. So p = E_photon / c.

So, E_photon is 2B = 9.22e-23 J.

So p = (9.22e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = approximately 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, that's way smaller than any of the options given. The options are all in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range.

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I got the model wrong. Let me think again. Perhaps the molecule is in its vibrational ground state, v=0, but the lowest rotational state? Or perhaps in the non-rigid model, the energy levels are a combination of both.

Wait, the non-rigid rotor model (also called the rotation-vibration model) includes both vibrational and rotational energy. So the energy levels are given by E = E_vib + E_rot.

The ground state in this model would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next possible higher state would be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1.

Which of these is lower in energy? Let's compute the energy for each.

E_vib for v=1 is (3/2)ħω (since E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω, but wait, I think the harmonic oscillator has E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω. So the difference between v=0 and v=1 is ħω.

E_rot for J=0 is 0, and for J=1 it's 2B.

So the total energy for each transition:

- v=1, J=0: E_total = (1 + 1/2) ħω + 0 = (3/2) ħω.
- v=0, J=1: E_total = (0 + 1/2) ħω + 2B.

Which is lower? Let's compute both.

We already have ħω ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

So E for v=1, J=0: (3/2)*4.218e-20 = 6.327e-20 J.

E for v=0, J=1: (1/2)*4.218e-20 + 9.22e-23 = 2.109e-20 + 9.22e-23 ≈ 2.201e-20 J.

So the transition to v=0, J=1 is lower in energy (2.2e-20 J) compared to v=1, J=0 (6.3e-20 J). Therefore, the minimal energy transition would be to the (v=0, J=1) state, requiring 2B energy, which is 9.22e-23 J.

But wait, the ground state is (v=0, J=0), so the next state would be (v=0, J=1), which is a rotational transition, so the photon needs to supply 2B energy.

So the energy of the photon is 2B = 9.22e-23 J.

Then, the momentum p of the photon is E/c. So p = (9.22e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options are that small. The options are in the 1e-27 range. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Hmm, perhaps I got the model wrong. Maybe the correct transition is a vibrational one, not a rotational. Or perhaps the molecule is in the rotational ground state, but the question is about the vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps the model is the non-rigid rotor, hence the energy levels are E = E_vib + E_rot, but the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next state could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1.

The energy of the photon must match the energy difference between these states.

But wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the one with the smallest possible energy increase, which would be the (v=0, J=1) state, requiring 2B energy, which is 9.22e-23 J.

But as calculated earlier, that gives a photon momentum of about 3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is not among the options. So perhaps I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, let me double-check the moment of inertia. Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculating μ or I.

Wait, Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2)/(22) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. That's correct.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = approx 3.016e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Wait, that's correct. Then B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2/(2*1.2064e-46) = (1.112e-68)/(2.4128e-46) ≈ 4.61e-23 J.

Wait, no, 1.112e-68 divided by 2.4128e-46 is approximately 4.61e-23 J. So yes, 2B is 9.22e-23 J.

Hmm, but the photon momentum comes out as 3e-31 kg m/s, which is way too small. The options are in 1e-27 to 1e-28.

Wait, perhaps I should be considering the vibrational transition, perhaps the photon has to supply the energy for a vibrational transition, which is higher. Let me reevaluate.

If the photon causes a transition from v=0 to v=1, then the energy is ħω, which is 4.218e-20 J.

Then p = (4.218e-20 J)/(3e8 m/s) = 1.406e-29 kg m/s.

Still way smaller than any given options.

Wait, maybe I messed up the model. In the non-rigid rotor model, the vibrational and rotational energies are coupled, so the energy levels are a combination. So perhaps the transition would involve both a change in vibrational and rotational state.

Wait, but the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is v=0 and J=0.

Wait, perhaps the next state is the first possible higher energy, which could be J=1 or v=1. But I thought the rotational transition requires less energy, but the options don't match.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the fundamental vibrational state, and the next state is the first rotational state, but I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the photon's energy needs to supply both a vibrational and rotational transition. But that would require even more energy, which doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is that the molecule is treated as a rigid rotor and a harmonic oscillator, and the energy levels are E = E_vib + E_rot.

In that case, the fundamental state is v=0, J=0.

The possible next states would be (v=1, J=0) and (v=0, J=1).

Which one has lower energy? Let's compute their energies.

E_vib for v=1 is (1 + 1/2)ħω = (3/2)ħω = 6.327e-20 J.

E_rot for J=1 is 2B = 9.22e-23 J.

E_vib for v=0 is (1/2)ħω = 2.109e-20 J.

So the total energies are:

(v=1, J=0): 6.327e-20 J.

(v=0, J=1): 2.109e-20 + 9.22e-23 ≈ 2.201e-20 J.

So the next state with the lowest possible energy is (v=0, J=1), requiring 2B (9.22e-23 J).

Then, the photon's energy is 9.22e-23 J.

Momentum p = E/c = (9.22e-23 J)/(3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Hmm, but the options are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28, which is about three to four orders of magnitude larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recheck the B calculation.

B = ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, I = μ R². So μ is 1.818 amu, R is 2 angstroms.

Wait, maybe I should have converted R to meters correctly. 2 angstroms is indeed 2e-10 meters.

So I = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Then ħ = 1.05457e-34 J s.

So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 = (1.05457)^2 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So B = (1.112e-68 J² s²) / (2 * 1.2064e-46 kg m²).

Wait, denominator is 2 * I = 2 * 1.2064e-46 = 2.4128e-46 kg m².

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.4128e-46 = approx 4.61e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.22e-23 J.

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, unless I'm confused about what the 'fundamental state' refers to. Maybe the 'fundamental state' is the first excited state of vibration, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the model being considered here is the rigid rotor, which ignores the vibrational part, but the question says the non-rigid rotor model (rotation-vibration), so that includes both.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is in the (v=0, J=0) state, and the next state is (v=0, J=1), which requires 2B.

But again, the momentum comes out to 3e-31, which is way below the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the transition to the next vibrational state, which requires ħω.

Wait, that's 4.218e-20 J.

p = (4.218e-20) / (3e8) = 1.406e-29 kg m/s.

Still way too small.

Hmm, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. The question could be about the energy needed to transition between rotational states, but perhaps it's a vibrational transition in the non-rigid rotor model.

Wait, wait, perhaps the molecule is in the ground state, and the next state is the first vibrational state (v=1), but the photon also induces a change in rotational state.

No, that would require even more energy.

Alternately, perhaps the question is considering only the rotational part, but that doesn't fit the model description.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is referring to the energy levels as a simple rotation-vibration model where the energy spacing for the next state (like v=1, J=0) is the sum of vibrational and rotational contributions. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the model is such that the next state is the first vibrational state, v=1, which requires an energy of ħω.

So, the photon's energy is ħω, which is 4.218e-20 J. Then, p = E/c = 1.406e-29 kg m/s.

But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the rotational transition but just the vibrational transition. But why is the model called rotation-vibration then?

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the molecule's transition to the next state in terms of the combined rotational and vibrational states, but in the non-rigid model, each vibrational level includes rotational states. So the next state after (v=0, J=0) would be (v=0, J=1), which is lower in energy than (v=1, J=0).

So, the correct energy to consider is 2B, which is 9.22e-23 J. Then, the momentum is E/c = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But again, the options don't match. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the transition from the rotational ground state (J=0) to the first vibrational state (v=1). But that would require energy of ħω, which is 4.218e-20 J.

p = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-29 kg m/s.

Still not matching options.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing a factor in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the question is about the transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1), which would require 2B.

But perhaps I miscalculated B.

Wait, let's recompute B.

I = μ R² = (20*2/(20+2)) * (1.66e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, wait, let me compute μ again.

Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

1 amu = 1.660539e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.81818 * 1.660539e-27 kg ≈ (approx 1.818 * 1.6605) = let's compute: 1.8 *1.6605 = ~2.989e-27 kg.

Wait, 1.81818 * 1.660539 = let's compute more accurately.

1.818 * 1.6605 = 1.818 * 1.66 is about 3.017.

So μ ≈ 3.017e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

Then, B = ħ²/(2I).

Hmm, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So, ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So, B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.2068e-46) = 1.112e-68 / (2.4136e-46) ≈ 4.608e-23 J.

So, 2B = 9.216e-23 J.

Photon energy E = 9.216e-23 J.

Momentum p = E/c = 9.216e-23 / (3e8) = 3.072e-31 kg·m/s.

Hmm, but none of the options are close to this. The options are in the 1e-27 range. So, I'm definitely missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the photon's energy needed to cause a transition in the rotational-vibration model, not just the rotational or vibrational part. Or perhaps I'm supposed to consider the vibrational transition, which requires ħω.

But earlier calculation shows that the energy is 4.218e-20 J, which is way above the options.

Wait, perhaps the model is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor, so only rotational transitions are considered. But the question says it's the non-rigid rotor model.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition, and the photon's energy is ħω, but that would still give a momentum of 1.4e-29 kg·m/s, which doesn't match any options.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, 1 Ns is 1 kg·m/s. So the options are in kg·m/s.

Wait, my calculation for the rotational transition gives 3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is 3.07e-31 Ns. The options are in 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns, which is about three to four orders of magnitude larger.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the model. Maybe I should think about the vibration and rotation as separate, and the photon's energy corresponds to the vibrational energy, which is ħω.

Wait, because the question says, "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So, perhaps the minimal energy change is a vibrational transition, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the molecule in a purely rotational state, and we're to find the momentum of a photon that causes a rotational transition. But that would ignore the vibrational part.

Alternatively, perhaps the model actually considers the molecule as a rigid rotor, where the moment of inertia is considered fixed. But the problem states it's the non-rigid model.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the vibrational energy because the options are on the order of 1e-27 kg m/s, which would correspond to ħω.

So, E_photon = ħω = 4.218e-20 J.

p = E/c = 4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-29 kg m/s.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ħω.

Wait, w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So, ħω = (1.05457e-34 J s) * 4e14 rad/s = 4.218e-20 J.

Hmm, correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the energy change as a combination of both vibrational and rotational transitions, but it would be higher than either, so that's not the case.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state as the first rotational state (J=1), but using the rigid rotor model, which ignores the vibrational part.

In the rigid rotor model, the energy is E_rot = B J (J+1). So, for J=0 to J=1, delta E = 2B.

But I still get p = 3e-31 kg m/s, which is not an option.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is phrased such that the next state is the first excited state, which would be the combination of the first vibrational and rotational states. But that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the model is the particle in a box model, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the angular frequency with the frequency. The photon's energy is E = h ν, where ν is the frequency.

Wait, but in the problem, the angular frequency w is given, which is 2π ν. So, ν = w/(2π).

So, E_photon for vibrational transition would be h ν = (h * w) / (2π) = (6.626e-34 J s * 4e14 rad/s) / (2π) ≈ (2.65e-19 J s * rad/s) / 6.28 ≈ (2.65e-19) /6.28 ≈ 4.21e-20 J. Which is same as before.

Hmm, no difference.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy needed is the vibrational energy, which is ħ ω, but the momentum is p= ħ ω / c.

Wait, but that gives the same p as before.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the photon's momentum, but considering relativistic factors, but that's unlikely at these energy scales.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the momentum of the molecule, but the question says photon's momentum.

Hmm, this is perplexing. Maybe I need to find the momentum using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule's transition as a change in the rotational state, but using the formula for rotational energy in terms of the bond length and moment of inertia.

So, the energy difference for the rotational transition is E = (ħ^2 (J+1))/(2I). Wait, no, E_rot = (ħ² / (2I)) * J (J+1). So, for J=0 to J=1, delta E is 2 (ħ² / (2I)) ), which is (ħ²)/(I) ).

Hmm, so delta E = (ħ^2)/(I) ).

Wait, but earlier, B = ħ²/(2I), so delta E is 2B = 2*(ħ²/(2I)) )= ħ^2/I.

Wait, but that's the same as before.

Hmm, perhaps the energy is different. Let me compute delta E.

I = μ R².

So, delta E for J=0→1 is (ħ²/(2I)) * (1*(1+1) - 0) ) = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/(I) = 2B.

Wait, yes, same as before.

So, E_photon = 2B = 9.22e-23 J.

p_photon = E/c = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are way larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the model.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the molecule is treated as a rigid rotor, and the energy to excite it to the next state is the rotational energy, but the question mentions non-rigid.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is that the next state is the first vibrational state, which is v=1, requiring energy of ħ ω.

But that would give p= (4.218e-20 J )/(3e8 m/s )= 1.406e-29 kg m/s.

Hmm, but that's much smaller than options.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is considering the energy as a combination of both vibrational and rotational, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the momentum of the molecule, not the photon. Oh, wait, no, the question says photon.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the way I calculate the energy. Maybe the energy difference is not 2B, but something else.

Wait, perhaps the non-rigid rotor model includes both rotational and vibrational contributions, but the next state is the first excited state, which is a combination of v=1 and J=0. So, the energy difference would be ħ ω + some rotational term.

Wait, but the problem says the photon is absorbed, so the molecule goes to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, the minimal energy increment would be the smallest possible delta E, which would be the rotational transition.

Hmm, but then why the options don't match.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the energy of the photon not as ħω, but as the product of some other factors. Like, perhaps the photon's momentum is related to the rotational energy.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecule's transition is due to a photon's angular momentum, which would relate to the rotational state.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the options to see which one fits.

Let me compute the energy corresponding to each option.

Option A: p =1.9e-28 kg m/s.

E = p c = 1.9e-28 * 3e8 = 5.7e-20 J.

Compare to ħω which is 4.218e-20 J. So 5.7e-20 is a bit higher.

Option B: p=2.3e-27 kg m/s → E= 6.9e-20 J.

Option C: p=1.1e-27 → E= 3.3e-20 J.

Option D: p=1.4e-28 → E=4.2e-20 J.

Wait, option D's energy is ~4.2e-20 J, which matches ħ ω which is 4.218e-20 J.

So, the energy of the photon would be ħ ω, which corresponds to option D's momentum of 1.4e-28 kg m/s.

Wait, but earlier, I thought the minimal transition would be the rotational one (2B=9.22e-23 J), which is much smaller than ħ ω. But perhaps the question is referring to the vibrational transition.

So, perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition, not the rotational. But why would the model be rotation-vibration then?

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the photon's momentum to transition the molecule to the next vibrational state, regardless of the model.

In that case, the photon's energy is ħω, which gives p= ħω / c = 1.4e-28 kg m/s.

So, that's option D.

But why would the model be called rotation-vibration then?

Alternatively, perhaps the next state is the first vibrational state, and the rotational state is not considered to change.

Wait, but in reality, when a photon is absorbed, it can cause a transition either in vibration, rotation, or both, but the question is about the minimal energy.

Wait, perhaps the minimal energy transition is the rotational one, but the calculation doesn't match any options, so perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition.

Since option D matches the ħω calculation, perhaps that's the intended answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, where the molecule is in its fundamental state (lowest energy state). The goal is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The given parameters are:

- Mass of atom X: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \)
- Mass of atom Y: \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
- Bond length: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
- Angular frequency: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Levels in the Rotation-Vibration Model**:
   - The total energy of the molecule is the sum of vibrational and rotational contributions:
     \[
     E = E_{\text{vib}} + E_{\text{rot}}
     \]
     where \( E_{\text{vib}} = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) \hbar \omega \) and \( E_{\text{rot}} = B J (J+1) \), with \( B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} \) being the rotational constant.
   - The fundamental state corresponds to \( v = 0 \) and \( J = 0 \). The next possible states are:
     - \( (v=1, J=0) \): purely vibrational transition.
     - \( (v=0, J=1) \): purely rotational transition.

2. **Energy Differences**:
   - The vibrational energy difference between \( v=0 \) and \( v=1 \) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) (4 \times 10^{14}) = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
     \]
   - The rotational energy difference between \( J=0 \) and \( J=1 \) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \left(\frac{\hbar^2}{2I}\right).
     \]
     The reduced mass \( \mu \) is:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} = 1.818 \, \text{amu} = 3.016 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
     \]
     The moment of inertia \( I \) is:
     \[
     I = \mu R^2 = (3.016 \times 10^{-27}) (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2064 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
     \]
     Substituting into \( B \):
     \[
     B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \times 1.2064 \times 10^{-46}} = 4.61 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]
     Thus, \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \).

3. **Comparison of Transitions**:
   - The vibrational transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \)) requires significantly more energy than the rotational transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \)).
   - Since the question asks for the next state with the **lowest possible energy**, the rotational transition is the correct choice.

4. **Photon Momentum**:
   - The energy of the photon corresponds to the rotational transition:
     \[
     E_{\text{photon}} = \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]
   - The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):
     \[
     p = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} = 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
     \]
   - However, none of the provided options match this value. The closest match is obtained by considering the vibrational transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \)):
     \[
     p = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} = 1.406 \times 10^{-29} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
     \]
   - This corresponds to **Option D** (\( p = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)).

### Conclusion:
The problem likely intends for the vibrational transition to be considered, as the rotational transition does not match any of the provided options. The photon's momentum required to transition the molecule to the next vibrational state is \( p = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \).
