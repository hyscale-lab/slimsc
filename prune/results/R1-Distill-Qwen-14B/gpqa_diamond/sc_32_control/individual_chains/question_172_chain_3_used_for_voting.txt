Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's photosphere relates to its temperature. When atoms are more excited, it usually means higher temperature because more energy is available to excite them.

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh right, that's a specific value for delta E. I think this relates to the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the distribution of particles in different energy states in thermal equilibrium (LTE, local thermodynamic equilibrium in this case).

The Boltzmann equation comes to mind. The formula is something like the ratio of populations in two energy states is equal to the exponential of the negative of the energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

So, the ratio of excited state to ground state (or lower state) is n2/n1 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)).

In this problem, star_1 has twice as excited atoms as star_2. So for each star, we can write their respective ratios.

Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and star_2 as R2. So, R1 = n21 /n11 = 2 (since twice as excited), and R2 = n22/n12.

Wait, but wait, actually, the problem states that the excitation is twice as much, so the population in the higher energy level is twice as much compared to the same level in the other star. Or perhaps it's the ratio of the excited level to the ground level.

Assuming that each star's photosphere is in LTE, the ratio for each star would be given by:

n1 / n0 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)).

Wait, no, the Boltzmann factor is n2/n1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where n2 is the number in higher energy level, n1 in lower. So for Star 1, n2_1 / n1_1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for Star 2, n2_2 / n1_2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But the question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. Oh wait, so maybe that ratio n2/n1 is 2 for star_1, and something else for star_2. Let me think.

Wait, it's a bit ambiguous. The problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are "twice as excited in a specific energy level" compared to star_2. I think that means that, for that specific level, the excitation is higher. Or perhaps, the population in the excited state is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2.

So perhaps, for star_1, n2/n1 = 2, and for star_2, n2/n1 = something else. Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the ratio of n2 in star_1 to n2 in star_2 is 2, but that might not directly tie into the Boltzmann equation.

Wait, perhaps the question is more about comparing T1 and T2 based on the excitation levels. The higher the temperature, the more the atoms are excited.

So the ratio of the populations is given by the Boltzmann factor. So, for star_1, n2/n1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star_2, n2/n1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But according to the problem, in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So maybe the ratio n2_1 / n1_1 equals 2 times (n2_2 / n1_2). Or perhaps the ratio for star_1 is double that of star_2. Or maybe it's that the excitation is twice as high, so the ratio n2/n1 is higher by a factor of 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is n2/n1 for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, R1 = 2 * R2.

Wait, but maybe the problem is that the excitation is higher, so the population in the excited state is higher. So R1 = 2 R2.

Let me try to write the equations. Let me denote R1 = (n2)/(n1) for star_1, R2 = (n2)/(n1) for star_2.

Given: R1 = 2 R2.

But from Boltzmann, R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So, 2 R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

But R2 is exp(-ΔE/(k T2)), so substituting:

2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

Hmm, that seems a bit messy. Let me take natural logs on both sides to simplify.

Taking ln of both sides:

ln(2) + ln( exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) = ln( exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) )

Which simplifies to:

ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2) = -ΔE/(k T1)

Let me rearrange this:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k T2)] - [ΔE/(k T1)]

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

Hmm, but I don't have the value of ΔE or k. Wait, but the given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. Wait, Boltzmann's constant k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, wait, that's the same number! So ΔE is exactly k times a certain value.

Wait, let me compute. ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. And k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So, ΔE = k * (1.0) ?

Wait that can't be precise. Let me check: k is approximately 1.380649e-23 J/K. Oh! So ΔE is exactly k * 1.0 J/(something). Wait, no, because ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. So that's exactly k * 1 K. Because k is 1.38e-23 J/K, so k*T would have units of J when T is in K.

So ΔE = k * T * something. Wait, no: ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. So if T is 1 K, then k*T is 1.38e-23 J.

So ΔE = k*1 K.

So in the equation I derived earlier:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ]

But since ΔE =k *1 K, then ΔE/k = 1 K.

So,

ln(2) = [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] * 1

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, because 1/T2 -1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Yes, that's exactly what we have.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check. So when I substituted, I assumed R1 = 2 R2. Is that correct?

The problem says the number of excited atoms is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So if R = n2/n1, then R1 is twice R2.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me think again about the setup.

Suppose in star_1, the ratio n2/n1 is R1, and in star_2, it's R2.

The problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2."

Ah, perhaps this means that the excitation in star_1 is higher, so R1 = 2 R2.

So the earlier approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps it's that the population in the excited state is twice as much. So n2_1 = 2 n2_2.

But that would complicate things because the ratio n2/n1 would involve n1, the ground state.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio of excited to unexcited is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So R1 = 2 R2.

So I think the equation's correct.

So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The key information provided is that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2, and the energy difference between the energy levels is ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J. The photospheres are assumed to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann distribution applies.

The Boltzmann equation relates the ratio of populations in two energy states to the temperature:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(n_2/n_1\) is the ratio of the populations in the excited and ground states, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant (\(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\)), and \(T\) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the ratios of excited to ground state populations are:

\[
R_1 = \frac{n_{2,1}}{n_{1,1}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
R_2 = \frac{n_{2,2}}{n_{1,2}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, which implies:

\[
R_1 = 2 R_2.
\]

Substituting the expressions for \(R_1\) and \(R_2\) into this equation gives:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Since \(\Delta E = k \cdot 1 \, \text{K}\) (as \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\) and \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\)), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

**ln(2) = (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ T₂).**
