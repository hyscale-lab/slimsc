Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit, so the researchers should prioritize observing that one. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. But wait, the question says both planets have circular orbits, so alignment isn't an issue here. Oh wait, no, actually, the probability isn't just about alignment but also about the size ratio because a smaller planet or a larger star makes the transit less probable. But wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Wait, the probability of a transit is actually given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)² * (1 + (R_p / R_s))², where R_p is planet radius and R_s is star radius. Wait, no, that's not quite right. I think the formula is more like the ratio of the areas. So the probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by something else... Or wait, another approach: the probability is the ratio of the planet's orbital plane being aligned edge-on. But for distant stars, the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, I've heard that the probability of a planet transiting is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2. So if a planet is smaller or the star is larger, the probability is lower. But wait, wait. Another point to consider: the planet's orbital period affects how often it transits, but the question is about the probability of transit occurrence for a single event, not the frequency. So the transit probability is higher for planets with smaller orbits? Or does that relate to the period?

Wait, the transit probability depends on the alignment, and for a random orientation, the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (something else). Hmm, maybe I should think about the formula more clearly.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (1 + R_p / R_s)^2 ) / (1 + (R_p / R_s)) ) )? No, that's not right. Let me think again.

Oh wait, the standard formula for the transit probability, assuming uniform distribution of orbital inclinations, is P = (R_p + R_s)² / (R_s² + (a_p)^2), but that's when 'a_p' is the semi-major axis. Wait, that formula doesn't seem right. Alternatively, I think the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (the star's radius over the semi-major axis squared), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2. But wait, that can't be right because if R_p is much smaller than R_s, the probability would be low, which makes sense. But wait, another factor: the planet's orbital distance. A planet with a smaller orbital period is closer to the star, so the semi-major axis is smaller. How does that affect transit probability?

Wait, another approach. The transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view) depends on the size of the star and the planet, and the orbital distance.

The formula I remember is P = (R_p + R_s)² / ( (a_p (1 - e))² + (R_s + R_p)^2 ), where e is the eccentricity. But in this case, both orbits are circular, so e = 0. So it simplifies to P = (R_p + R_s)^2 / (a_p^2 + (R_s + R_p)^2 ). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, maybe the transit probability is given by the ratio of the area of the star that the planet can block, but since the planet's size is much smaller than the star, it might be approximated by (R_p / R_s)^2. But that can't be the whole story because the orbital distance also affects the chance of alignment.

Wait, perhaps the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / a_p²), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: When a planet is closer to its star (smaller semi-major axis a_p), the chance that its orbit crosses our line of sight is higher. Because the star's apparent size in the sky is larger, so a smaller a_p makes the planet's orbit cross the star more often. So the probability would be higher for closer-in planets.

But wait, the transit probability also depends on the relative sizes. If the planet is bigger relative to the star, the probability is higher. So both factors matter.

But in this question, what do we know?

Both planets have the same mass, but their host stars' properties vary. The star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Interesting, because usually more massive stars are bigger, but here they have the same radius. So Planet_1's star is more massive but same size as Planet_2's.

The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Since the period is shorter, the planet is closer to its star (using Kepler's third law: P² ∝ a³ / M_star). So Planet_1's semi-major axis a1 is much smaller than a2.

So let's denote:

For Planet_1:

- Period P1 = P2 / 3, since P1 is three times shorter.

Using Kepler's third law, (P1)^2 = (4π²/G(M1 + m_p)) * a1^3. But since M1 is much larger than m_p (planet mass), M1 + m_p ≈ M1.

So, (P1)^2 ≈ (4π²/(G M1)) a1^3.

Similarly, for Planet_2:

(P2)^2 ≈ (4π²/(G M2)) a2^3.

Given that M1 = 2 M2, since Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's.

So, P1 = P2 / 3.

So, substituting into Kepler's law:

(P2/3)^2 = (4π²/(G * 2 M2)) a1^3.

And P2^2 = (4π²/(G M2)) a2^3.

Let me take the ratio of the two equations:

(P2/3)^2 / P2^2 = [ (4π²/(G * 2 M2)) a1^3 ] / [ (4π²/(G M2)) a2^3 ]

Simplify left side: (1/9) = [ (1/(2 M2 G)) a1^3 ] / [ (1/(M2 G)) a2^3 ]

The 4π² and G cancel out.

So,

1/9 = (a1^3) / (2 a2^3 )

Multiply both sides by 2 a2^3:

2 a2^3 /9 = a1^3

So,

a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3

Take cube root:

a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3)

Calculating 2/9 is approximately 0.222, so cube root is about 0.6. Let's compute it precisely.

But maybe I don't need the exact numbers. Let's move on.

Now, both planets have same mass, but wait, the transit probability depends on the planet radius, not mass. Oh wait, the question says both planets have the same mass, but how about their radii? The question doesn't state that. Hmm, that's a complication. Because for a given mass, a planet could be either a larger gas giant or a smaller rocky planet. But without knowing their radii, how can we compute the transit probability?

Wait, the question says the researchers want to observe the planet with the highest probability of transiting. So the probability depends on (R_p / R_s)^2 and the orbital distance?

Wait, I'm getting stuck because the question doesn't provide R_p1 and R_p2. But wait, the question says that both planets have the same mass. Hmm, mass and radius aren't directly proportional except for certain densities. If both planets have the same mass and same density, their radii would be the same. But if they have different densities, their radii could differ. However, the question doesn't give any info about their radii. Hmm, this is a problem.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me re-read it.

The question states that both planets have the same masses and were detected via the RV method. The host stars have the same radii, but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star, but both stars have same radius. So R_s1 = R_s2.

So, the stars have same radius. So R_s1 = R_s2 = R_s.

So, if the planets have the same mass, but without knowing their radii, but in exoplanets, same mass doesn't imply same radius because gas giants have lower density.

Wait, but the question doesn't give us their radii. So maybe I'm supposed to assume that the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2, and perhaps the other factors come into play.

But wait, the RV method gives the minimum mass, but doesn't directly give the radius. So without knowing R_p, I can't calculate (R_p / R_s)^2. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability only depends on the ratio of the stars' sizes and the planets' orbital distances. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The transit method's probability is more likely when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on. But since the question states both have circular orbits, I think the probability is based purely on the geometric alignment. So the probability is (R_p + R_s)^2 / (a_p^2 + (R_p + R_s)^2 ). But without knowing R_p, that's hard.

Wait, but perhaps the only variable here is the star's radius and the planet's orbital distance. Let me think. If the star's radius is the same, and the planet's distance is a factor, then the closer planet (Planet_1) would have a higher probability because a smaller a_p would make the denominator smaller, increasing the overall fraction.

Wait, let's try that. The transit probability is higher when a_p is smaller because the planet's orbit is more likely to cross our line of sight. So for Planet_1, a_p is smaller because its period is shorter (since it's closer to a more massive star).

So the transit probability is inversely proportional to a_p. Or is it based on a_p squared?

Wait, the transit probability formula I think is approximately R_p²/(R_s + R_p)^2 * (R_s/(a_p (1 - e)))^2. But since e=0, and R_p << R_s, it's approximately (R_p/R_s)^2 * (R_s/a_p)^2. So overall, (R_p^2 R_s^2)/(R_s² a_p²) )= (R_p^2)/(a_p²). Wait, no, that would be (R_p^2) / (a_p²). Hmm, that can't be right because if a_p is smaller, the probability would be higher, which aligns with intuition.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (R_p/R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (R_s)/(a_p) )^2. Because when a_p is small, (R_s/a_p) is large, so the transit probability increases.

So, P ∝ (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (R_s^2 / a_p^2) ) = (R_p^2) / (a_p^2 )

So, P is proportional to (R_p^2) / (a_p^2 )

But both planets have the same mass, but their radii could differ. So without knowing R_p1 and R_p2, how can we compare?

Wait, perhaps the question assumes that the planets have similar densities, so R_p is proportional to (M_p)^(1/3). Since their masses are the same, R_p1 ≈ R_p2. So if R_p1 = R_p2, then R_p is the same.

Assuming that, then P is proportional to 1/(a_p^2 )

So let's compare a1 and a2.

We have from Kepler's third law earlier:

a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3)

Compute (2/9)^(1/3). 2/9 is about 0.222. Cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.6, because 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222.

So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

Therefore, a1 is about 0.6 times a2. So a_p1 is smaller than a_p2.

Since P is proportional to 1/(a_p^2 ), the planet with smaller a_p will have higher P.

So Planet_1 has a_p = 0.6 a2, so (a_p1/a_p2)^2 = (0.6)^2 = 0.36. So 1/0.36 is approximately 2.78 times higher.

So Planet_1's transit probability is about 2.78 times higher than Planet_2's.

Wait, but the options are:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~2.25 times higher.

B) Planet_2 ~1.5 times.

C) Planet_1 ~1.65 times.

D) Planet_1 ~2.7 times.

So if our calculation gives Planet_1 has higher probability, so options C or D.

Our calculation gave about 2.78 times higher for Planet_1. So option D says 2.7 times, which is close.

Wait, but let me recheck the math.

From earlier:

a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3)

Compute (2/9)^(1/3):

2/9 is 0.2222...

Cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.605.

So a1 ≈ 0.605 a2.

So (a1/a2) = 0.605

Thus, (a_p1/a_p2) = 0.605.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is (1/(0.605)^2 ) times that of Planet_2.

1/(0.605)^2 ≈ 1/(0.366) ≈ 2.73.

So about 2.73 times higher transit probability for Planet_1.

So option D says 2.7 times, so that's the correct choice.

Wait a minute, but I assumed that R_p1 = R_p2. What if that's not the case? Because the RV method gives the same minimum mass, but if the planets have different densities, their radii could be different. But the question doesn't provide any information about the planets' radii, so I think we have to assume that their radii are the same, or that their radii are the same fraction of their stars' radii.

Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is higher for closer planets, so Planet_1 has a higher probability, regardless of their radii.

Wait, but without knowing their radii, maybe the transit probability is only based on the orbital distance. But in reality, the transit probability also depends on the size of the star and planet.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

The transit probability is given by the formula:

P = (R_p/R_s)^2 * (1 + R_p/R_s)^2 / (1 + (R_p/R_s)^2 + (R_p/(a_p(1-e)))^2 )

But perhaps an approximation is (R_p/R_s)^2 * (R_s/a_p)^2.

Wait, but without knowing R_p, we can't directly compute this. Hmm, this is a problem because the planets' radii aren't given.

Wait, perhaps the question is implying that the transit probability is higher for the planet with the shorter period because it's closer, making the transit more likely, regardless of the star's radius.

Wait, but both stars have the same radius. So the star's radius is the same, but Planet_1 is closer.

So Planet_1 has a_p1 = 0.605 a2.

So since a_p1 is smaller, the probability of transit would be higher.

But the exact calculation would depend on R_p.

Wait, but maybe the question is simplified to the point where the probability is inversely proportional to (a_p)^2. So higher P for smaller a_p.

So the probability for Planet_1 is (a2/a1)^2 times higher.

Since a1 = 0.605 a2, a2/a1 is 1/0.605 ≈ 1.65.

So (a2/a1)^2 = (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

So the probability is about 2.7 times higher for Planet_1.

So the researchers would choose Planet_1.

Looking at the options, option D says Planet_1 is preferred with ~2.7 times higher probability. So the answer should be D.

To determine which planet has the higher probability of transiting, we analyze the given parameters:

1. **Key Factors Affecting Transit Probability**:  
   - Transit probability depends on the planet's orbital distance (\(a_p\)) and the relative sizes of the planet (\(R_p\)) and the star (\(R_s\)).  
   - The probability is approximately proportional to \((R_p / R_s)^2 \cdot (R_s / a_p)^2\), simplifying to \(P \propto (R_p^2) / (a_p^2)\), assuming \(R_p \ll R_s\).  
   - Since both planets have the same mass but their radii are not specified, we assume \(R_p\) is the same for both planets based on typical exoplanet density relationships.

2. **Orbital Distance Comparison**:  
   Using Kepler's Third Law, the orbital period (\(P\)) is related to the semi-major axis (\(a_p\)) and the star's mass (\(M_s\)) by:  
   \[
   P^2 \propto \frac{a_p^3}{M_s}
   \]  
   For Planet_1, \(P_1 = P_2 / 3\) and \(M_{s1} = 2M_{s2}\). Substituting into the law:  
   \[
   \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 \propto \frac{a_1^3}{2M_{s2}}, \quad P_2^2 \propto \frac{a_2^3}{M_{s2}}
   \]  
   Dividing the two equations:  
   \[
   \frac{\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / 2}{a_2^3}
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{2a_2^3} \implies a_1^3 = \frac{2}{9}a_2^3 \implies a_1 = a_2 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}
   \]  
   Approximating \(\left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.605\), we find \(a_1 \approx 0.605a_2\). Thus, Planet_1 is closer to its star.

3. **Transit Probability Comparison**:  
   Since \(P \propto 1 / a_p^2\), the transit probability for Planet_1 compared to Planet_2 is:  
   \[
   \frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2^2}{a_1^2} = \frac{a_2^2}{(0.605a_2)^2} = \frac{1}{0.605^2} \approx 2.73
   \]  
   Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability than Planet_2.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   Based on the calculations, Planet_1 is preferred due to its significantly higher transit probability.
