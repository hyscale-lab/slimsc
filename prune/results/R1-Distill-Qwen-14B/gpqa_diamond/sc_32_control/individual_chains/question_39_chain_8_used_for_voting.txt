Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the solution. Let's see what it's about. 

The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i, and when they measure the position of the particles, none are found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. 

Hmm, I remember that the wave function must be normalizable. That means the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. Oh wait, but in this case, the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3, so the wave function must be zero outside that region. But wait, the given wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. Or maybe not? Because the given wave function's denominator is sqrt(1+x), which is real and defined for x >= -1. But the problem states that particles are found only between x=1 and x=3. So maybe the wave function is zero elsewhere, but the given expression is valid in the region where the particle exists.

Wait, the wave function can't be zero in regions where the particle is not found, but the modulus squared will determine the probability. So the wave function given must be non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, which implies that outside this region, the wave function is zero. So the given wave function is actually the part that's non-zero between x=1 and x=3. 

But wait, the wave function provided is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Let's write that properly. So it's a complex function. The general form of the wave function should satisfy the Schrödinger equation, but perhaps more importantly for this problem, it's the normalization condition we need.

The normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1. Because the wave function is zero outside this interval, so the integral is from 1 to 3.

So ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me compute |ψ(x)|². That would be ψ* times ψ. 

ψ* is the complex conjugate, so it's (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. Multiplying these together:

[(a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i] * [(a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i] 

Which is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5i)(a / sqrt(1+x)) * (sqrt(1+x)/a) * i ?

Wait, no. Let me compute it step by step.

The product is (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5i)^2 ?

Wait, (a/sqrt(1+x))² is a²/(1+x). The cross terms would be (a/sqrt(1+x))*0.5i * (a/sqrt(1+x))*0.5i, but wait, no. Let me do it properly.

Actually, when you multiply (a - b)(a + b) = a² - b². So here, a is (a / sqrt(1+x)) and b is 0.5i.

So |ψ|² = (a²/(1+x)) - (0.5i)^2.

But (0.5i)^2 is (0.25)(i²) which is 0.25*(-1) = -0.25. 

So |ψ|² = (a²/(1+x)) - (-0.25) = a²/(1 + x) + 0.25.

Wait, that makes sense. So the square of the absolute value is a sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts. Because when you have a complex number, say, c = c_real + i c_imag, then |c|² = c_real^2 + c_imag^2. So in this case, the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is (-0.5). So |ψ|² = (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1 + x) + 0.25] dx must equal 1.

Let me set up the integral:

∫₁³ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

We can split this integral into two parts:

a² ∫₁³ [1/(1+x)] dx + 0.25 ∫₁³ dx = 1.

Compute each integral separately.

First integral: ∫ [1/(1+x)] dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln|1+x|. So evaluating from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

Second integral: ∫ dx from 1 to 3 is (3 - 1)= 2.

So putting it together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.25 * 2 = 1.

Simplify:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Solving for a²: a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's the value of ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849. Hmm, let me compute sqrt(0.7213). 

Wait, 0.85^2 is 0.7225, which is very close. Oh, so a is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options: option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by normalizing the wave function. The given wave function is:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and the normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

The absolute square of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25.
\]

Substituting this into the normalization condition:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1 + x} dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 1.
\]

The first integral evaluates as:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1 + x} dx = \ln|1 + x| \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
\]

The second integral evaluates as:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} dx = 3 - 1 = 2.
\]

Substituting these results back:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.25 \cdot 2 = 1.
\]

Simplify:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Subtract \( 0.5 \) from both sides:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5.
\]

Solve for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
