Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But let's take it step by step.

Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let me read the problem again to make sure I get all the details.

Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so M1 = 1.5 * M2. Interesting, same scaling for radius and mass.

The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law. Wien's Law is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. Because lambda is the same and b is a constant, T must be the same for both.

Wait, but the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1's radial velocity is 0 km/s, and Star_2's is 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. I remember that when a star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter (blue shift), and moving away causes a longer wavelength (red shift). But since the peak wavelengths are determined through spectroscopy, I think that the observed wavelengths are after accounting for their velocities. So maybe the actual temperatures are different, but after Doppler shift, the observed lambda_max is the same. Or perhaps the problem is considering the intrinsic (rest) wavelengths. Hmm, I need to clarify.

Wait, the problem says "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest" are the same. So in the observed frame, the lambda_max is same. So their rest lambda_max might be different, but due to Doppler shift, they appear the same. So I need to consider the Doppler shift to find their actual temperatures.

Wait, I think I should model this with the Doppler shift formula. The Doppler effect for wavelength is given by:

lambda_observed = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) )

Wait, no, the exact formula depends on whether it's recessional or approach. Also, the velocities are given as radial velocities: 0 for Star_1, 700 for Star_2. I think in km/s, which is non-relativistic, so we can probably use the approximation.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula in the non-relativistic limit (v much less than c) is:

lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r / c )

But wait, the formula can be a bit tricky. For a source moving away, v_r is positive, and the observed wavelength is longer. If moving towards, v_r is negative, and wavelength is shorter.

Wait, but in this problem, Star_1 has v_r =0. So its observed wavelength is the same as its rest wavelength. Star_2 has v_r=700 km/s. But wait, 700 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light, but let's see: 700,000 m/s, c is about 3e8 m/s. So 700e3 / 3e8 = approx 0.002333, so 0.233% of c. So perhaps using the non-relativistic approximation for Doppler shift is okay, but maybe using the exact relativistic formula is better for accurate results.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "assuming the stars radiate as black bodies." So perhaps the given v_r affects the observed temperatures. Hmm, perhaps.

Wait, the peak wavelength they appear brightest is the same. So, lambda_observed is same for both.

Star_1: v_r =0, so lambda_obs1 = lambda_rest1.

Star_2: v_r =700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away, so the observed wavelength is longer than the rest. So lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v_r / c) / (1 - v_r / c) ). Wait, no, wait. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta) / (1 - beta) ), where beta = v/c. But wait, for motion away, beta is positive.

Alternatively, the formula for redshift z is (lambda_obs - lambda_rest)/lambda_rest = z. And z is approximately v/c when v is small. But when we're dealing with the peak wavelengths, which are affected by the Doppler shift, it's better to think in terms of how the observed temperature relates to the actual temperature.

Since a star's temperature affects the peak wavelength (lambda_max = b / T), the observed temperature would be different due to Doppler shift.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to compute the actual temperatures of each star, then compute their luminosities.

So, let me outline the steps:

1. Both stars have the same observed lambda_max. Let's call this lambda_obs.

2. For Star_1, since v_r is zero, lambda_obs1 = lambda_rest1. So T1 = b / lambda_obs.

3. For Star_2, it's moving away at 700 km/s, so the observed lambda is longer. So lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v_r / c). But wait, the exact Doppler formula for wavelength when moving away is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r / c). Because when receding, the wavelength is stretched.

Wait, but I remember that the Doppler shift for wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ). But that's for light. Alternatively, for non-relativistic speeds, we approximate it as 1 + v/c.

But given that 700 km/s is about 0.0023c, perhaps the approximation is acceptable. Let me compute both ways to see if it makes a significant difference.

So, for Star_2, lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c). But since the observed lambda is the same as Star_1's, which is lambda_obs = lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c). So lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c).

But from Wien's law, lambda_rest = b / T. So for each star:

lambda_rest1 = b / T1

lambda_rest2 = b / T2

Given that lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c), substituting:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c)

Simplify: 1/T1 = (1/T2)(1 + v_r2/c)

So, T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c)

Wait, but that can't be right. Let me double-check. Because if Star 2 is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer than its rest wavelength. But since both observed lambdas are the same, lambda_obs = lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2*(1 + v_r2/c).

So lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + 0.7e6 / 3e5) [Wait, velocities in same units. Wait, 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s, and c is 3e8 m/s.

So v_r2 = 7e5 m/s.

v_r2 / c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7e-3, approximately 0.002333.

So (1 + v_r2/c) ≈ 1.002333.

So lambda_rest1 ≈ lambda_rest2 * 1.002333.

But from Wien's law, since lambda_rest is proportional to 1/T, T1 = T2 / 1.002333 ≈ T2*(1 - 0.002333) ≈ 0.9976667 * T2. So T1 is slightly less than T2.

Wait, but let's think about it: if Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted, so the observed lambda is longer. But the rest lambda is shorter than the observed, since when it's moving away, the observed is longer. So for Star_2, lambda_rest2 = lambda_obs / (1 + v_r2/c). So lambda_rest2 = lambda_obs / (1.002333) ≈ 0.9976667 * lambda_obs.

Similarly, for Star_1, lambda_rest1 = lambda_obs.

So, for Star_1, T1 = b / lambda_rest1 = b / lambda_obs.

For Star_2, T2 = b / lambda_rest2 = b / (lambda_obs / (1.002333)) ) = (b * 1.002333) / lambda_obs = (1.002333) * T1.

So T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

Wait, that makes sense. Because Star_2 is moving away, its rest wavelength is shorter, so its temperature is higher. But the observed lambda is same as Star_1, so Star_2 is intrinsically hotter.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting conclusions. Let me think again.

Alternatively, considering the Doppler effect on the observed wavelength. The observed wavelength is longer for Star_2, which is moving away. So, if both have the same observed lambda_max, then Star_2's rest wavelength must be shorter, implying a higher temperature.

So, the actual temperatures are: T1 = b / lambda_rest1 = b / lambda_obs.

T2 = b / lambda_rest2.

But lambda_rest2 = lambda_obs / (1 + v_r2/c), since when moving away, observed lambda is larger than rest.

So, T2 = b / (lambda_obs / (1 + v_r2/c)) ) = b * (1 + v_r2/c) / lambda_obs = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c).

So T2 = T1 * (1 + 700e3 / 3e8) ≈ T1 * (1 + 0.002333) ≈ 1.002333 * T1.

Okay, so Star_2 is hotter than Star_1 by a factor of about 1.002333.

But wait, what's the next step. The problem is about luminosity. Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So, Luminosity is proportional to R² T⁴.

So, L1 = 4π (R1)² σ T1⁴.

L2 = 4π (R2)² σ T2⁴.

We need to find L1 / L2.

Given:

R1 = 1.5 R2.

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c) ?

Wait, no, earlier conclusion was that T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c).

Wait, let me recheck.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recast the Doppler shift.

For Star_2, moving away at velocity v.

The observed wavelength lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v/c), assuming v << c.

So lambda_rest = lambda_obs / (1 + v/c).

Since lambda_rest is inversely proportional to temperature, T = b / lambda_rest.

So T_rest = (b) / (lambda_obs / (1 + v/c)) ) = (b (1 + v/c) ) / lambda_obs.

But for Star_1, T1 = b / lambda_obs.

So, T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c) ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

So, T2 is higher than T1 by a small factor.

So, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 is:

(L1) / (L2) = [ (R1² T1⁴) ] / [ (R2² T2⁴) ]

Substituting R1=1.5 R2, T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)² * T1⁴ ) / ( R2² * (T1 * 1.002333 )⁴ )

Simplify:

= ( (2.25 R2²) * T1⁴ ) / ( R2² * T1⁴ * (1.002333)^4 )

The R2² and T1⁴ terms cancel out.

= 2.25 / (1.002333)^4.

Now, calculate (1.002333)^4.

Let me compute 1.002333^4.

First, compute ln(1.002333) ≈ 0.002329.

Then, 4 * 0.002329 ≈ 0.009316.

Exponentiate: e^0.009316 ≈ 1.00937.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps a better approximation without logs.

(1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + nx when x is small.

Here, x=0.002333, n=4.

(1.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.002333) = 1 + 0.009332 = 1.009332.

So approximately 1.009332.

But let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 1.002333 squared:

1.002333^2 = (approx) 1.004673.

Then, square that:

1.004673^2 ≈ 1.00937.

So, (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.00937.

So, denominator is approximately 1.00937.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ ?

Compute 2.25 / 1.00937.

Let me compute 2.25 divided by 1.00937.

Well, 1.00937 is approximately 1.00937.

So, 2.25 / 1.00937 = ?

Let me compute 2.25 / 1.00937.

Alternatively, 2.25 * (1/1.00937) = 2.25 * approx 0.9907.

Because 1/1.00937 ≈ 0.9907.

So, 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227.

So, approximately 2.227, which is about 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So, the ratio L1/L2 is approximately 2.23, which would correspond to option D.

But wait, did I make any mistakes in the calculation? Let me see.

Another way: L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴ )

R1=1.5 R2 → (R1/R2)=1.5 → (R1²/R2²)=2.25.

T2 = T1*(1 + v_r2/c) → T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v_r2/c) → (T1/T2)^4 = [1/(1+vr2/c)]^4.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [1/(1+vr2/c)]^4.

vr2/c =700000 /3e8 = 0.002333...

So,

(1 + 0.002333) = 1.002333.

[1/(1.002333)]^4 = approx?

1/(1.002333)^4 = 1/(1.00937) ≈ 0.9907.

So, 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227.

Which is about 2.23, so option D.

But wait, why isn't the Doppler effect more significant? Because the velocity is 700 km/s, which is about 0.23% the speed of light. So the Doppler shift is small, but the question is about the ratio.

Wait, but what if I used the exact Doppler formula instead of the approximation?

The exact Doppler shift for wavelength when moving away is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) )

Wait, but wait: actually, for a source moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So the Doppler factor is:

lambda_obs / lambda_rest = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

lambda_rest = lambda_obs / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ) = lambda_obs * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Which can be written as lambda_obs * [ (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ]^(1/2).

So,

T_rest = b / lambda_rest = b / [lambda_obs * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ]

= (b / lambda_obs) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Because 1/sqrt(a/b) is sqrt(b/a).

So,

T_rest = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Because T1 = b / lambda_obs.

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Let me compute sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) where v=700 km/s.

v=700,000 m/s, c=3e8 m/s.

v/c=700e3 /3e8 = 0.002333333.

So,

(1 + 0.002333)/(1 -0.002333) = (1.002333)/(0.9976667) ≈ 1.00467.

The square root of 1.00467 is approximately 1.00233.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(1.00467):

1.00467^0.5 ≈ 1.00233.

So, sqrt(1.00467) ≈ 1.00233.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.00233.

Wait, that's similar to the approximation earlier. So,

T2 is T1 multiplied by approximately 1.00233.

So, now, the luminosity ratio:

L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= (2.25) * [ (1) / (1.00233)^4 ]

So, compute (1.00233)^4.

Again, (1.00233)^4 is approximately (1.00233)^2 squared.

1.00233^2 = approx (1 + 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 ) ≈ 1.00466 + 0.00000543 ≈ 1.004665.

Then, 1.004665^2 ≈ (1 + 2*0.004665 + (0.004665)^2 ) ≈ 1 + 0.00933 + 0.0000217 ≈ 1.00935.

So,

(1.00233)^4 ≈ 1.00935.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.00935 ≈ 2.25 * (1/1.00935) ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907.

Which is 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227.

Again, approximately 2.23, so option D.

But wait, let me compute 1/1.00935 more accurately.

1.00935 is about 1.00935.

So,

1 / 1.00935 ≈ 0.9907.

So, 2.25 * 0.9907 = let me compute it:

2.25 * 0.9907 = ?

2 * 0.9907 = 1.9814.

0.25 * 0.9907 = 0.2477.

Total: 1.9814 + 0.2477 ≈ 2.2291.

So approximately 2.229, which rounds to about 2.23, so option D.

Wait, but why did the earlier approximation (using 1 + v/c) give the same result? Because for small velocities, the exact Doppler shift is approximated well by (1 + v/c), but wait, the exact formula involves a square.

So, in this case, the Doppler shift is causing the observed wavelength to be longer, which implies the rest wavelength is shorter, hence higher temperature. So Star_2 is hotter than Star_1, but only by a small amount.

But in terms of luminosity, which depends on R² T⁴, the R factor is 1.5, so R² is 2.25. The T factor is (T2 / T1) which is about 1.00233, so (T2/T1)^4 is about 1.00935. Hence, L2 is (2.25) * (1.00935) times L1. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in L1/L2 = 2.25 * [1/(1.00935)] ≈ 2.23.

Wait, no, earlier calculation: L1/L2 = (2.25) / (1.00935) ≈ 2.229.

So, L1 is about 2.23 times L2.

But wait, the problem states that the astronomers calculated the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor of one of the options. So, L1/L2 is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but let's recall another point: the problem says that the stars have the same observed peak wavelengths, which after considering Doppler shift, leads us to the T2 being higher than T1.

So, the luminosity of Star_1 is larger than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


Astronomers are analyzing the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, under the assumption that they radiate as black bodies. The problem provides the following key details:

1. **Star Properties**:  
   - Radius: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)  
   - Mass: \( M_1 = 1.5 M_2 \)  
   - Radial velocities: \( v_{r1} = 0 \, \text{km/s}, \, v_{r2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)  
   - Observed peak wavelengths: \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \).

2. **Key Relationships**:  
   - Luminosity of a black body: \( L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \).  
   - Wien's Law: \( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} \), where \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \) is inversely proportional to temperature \( T \).  
   - Doppler shift formula (non-relativistic approximation):  
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} (1 + v_r/c)
     \]
     For Star_2, moving away at \( v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), the observed wavelength is stretched, so:  
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{1 + v_r/c}
     \]

3. **Temperature Ratio**:  
   Using Wien's Law, the rest wavelengths are inversely proportional to the temperatures:  
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{rest,2}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest,1}}}
   \]
   Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{1 + v_r/c} \) and \( \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs}} \):  
   \[
   T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v_r/c)
   \]
   For \( v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \):  
   \[
   \frac{v_r}{c} = 0.002333, \quad T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.002333
   \]

4. **Luminosity Ratio**:  
   The luminosity of a star is proportional to \( R^2 T^4 \). Thus:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
   \]
   Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.002333 \):  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5)^2}{(1.002333)^4}
   \]
   Compute \( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \) and \( (1.002333)^4 \approx 1.00937 \):  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25}{1.00937} \approx 2.23
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2. This corresponds to option **D**.

Answer: D
