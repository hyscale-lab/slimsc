Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question here. Let's see what it's about. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Oh wait, right! Parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d) in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, which means that as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N ∝ d^5. But wait, the question is about how N changes with distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. But the options are in terms of r, which is distance. So if N is proportional to r^5, that would be option B.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So when plx increases, N decreases. Since plx is 1/d, when d increases, plx decreases. So N is proportional to d^5. But how does that translate when considering per unit range of distance?

Wait, maybe I should think about how the number density of stars changes with distance. Oh, right! The number of stars in a region depends on the volume. Volume in 3D space scales with the cube of the radius. So when you move out a small distance dr, the volume element (and hence the number of stars) would depend on r^2 dr, because the surface area of a sphere is 4πr², and as you move dr, you add a thin shell with volume ~4πr² dr.

But wait, the problem says the number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5. Let me think again. Parallax plx = 1/d. So 1/plx^5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5. But when you're looking at how the number of stars changes per unit distance (like in a thin shell), that's the gradient. So the number in a thin shell would be proportional to the number density times the volume. Wait, but the number density might change with distance too.

Wait, maybe I should approach this more carefully. Let's model this mathematically.

Let's define N as the number of stars in a region. The problem states N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, substituting we get N ∝ d^5. So N = k * d^5, where k is some constant.

But wait, how does this relate to the number per unit distance? Because the question is about the change in the number of stars with distance, per unit range. So perhaps we're looking for dN/dr, the derivative of N with respect to r (distance).

If N = k r^5, then dN/dr = 5k r^4. So the number of stars increases with r^4 as you move away. So the correct option would be C, ~ r^4.

Wait, but earlier I thought maybe it's r^5 because N is proportional to r^5. But the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range, which suggests the derivative, which is r^4.

So the answer should be C, ~ r^4. So the correct option is C.

The question involves understanding how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance, given that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( d \)) as \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), substituting this into the relation gives \( N \propto d^5 \). 

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range, we consider the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \), which represents the rate of change of the number of stars over a small distance interval. If \( N = k d^5 \), where \( k \) is a constant, then \( \frac{dN}{dd} = 5k d^4 \). This shows that the number of stars increases with \( d^4 \) as distance increases.

Thus, the correct answer is that the number of stars changes with distance as \( r^4 \).
