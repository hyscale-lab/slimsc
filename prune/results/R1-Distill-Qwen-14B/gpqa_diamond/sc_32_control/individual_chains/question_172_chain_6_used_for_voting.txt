Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let's see. The question is about iron atoms in the photospheres of two stars, star_1 and star_2. It says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Also, the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I think that means the Boltzmann distribution applies here.

Wait, Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy states in a system. The formula is something like the ratio of the number of particles in two states is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by Boltzmann's constant times temperature. Right, the formula is (n_i / n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k_B T) ). 

In this case, the energy levels are different, so the iron atoms in star_1 have a higher population in the excited state compared to star_2. The question states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Let me parse that. So, if the energy levels are E1 and E2, but wait, no, the energy difference between the levels is the same for both stars because it's a specific energy level. Oh wait, no, the energy difference is given as a fixed value, 1.38e-23 J. So for both stars, the same energy difference ΔE = E_high - E_low = 1.38e-23 J.

So for star_1, the population in the excited state is n1, and for star_2, it's n2. According to the problem, n1 = 2 * n2.

Wait, no, the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the ratio (n_high / n_low) is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again. Oh, wait, the wording is: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So the number of excited atoms in star_1's photosphere is twice that in star_2. So n1 = 2 * n2.

But wait, let's get it right. The ratio n_high / n_low is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for each star, we have:

(n_high / n_low) = exp( -ΔE / (k_B T) )

So for star_1, (n1_high / n1_low) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2, (n2_high / n2_low) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. Wait, does that mean the ratio (n_high / n_low) is twice as large in star_1, or the actual number of excited atoms is twice as much? Hmm, because the number of atoms in each state depends on both the ratio and the total number of atoms. But perhaps, for simplicity, the problem is considering the ratio of the populations in the excited state to the lower state. So star_1 has a higher ratio. Because if the energy difference is the same, then a higher temperature would lead to a higher ratio. Because exp(-ΔE/(k T)) is larger when T is larger, since the exponent becomes less negative.

Wait, but wait, let's think. The Boltzmann factor is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So if T is higher, the denominator is bigger, so the exponent is a smaller negative number, so the whole term becomes larger. So for a higher temperature, the ratio (n_high / n_low) increases. So if star_1's ratio is twice as much as star_2's, then the ratio for star_1 is 2 * (ratio for star_2). Or is it that the number of excited atoms is twice as much? Hmm, but the problem says "twice as excited," which probably refers to the ratio of their populations. So let me proceed with that.

So let's denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 = n1_high / n1_low = 2 * (n2_high / n2_low) = 2 * R2.

Wait, no, the problem says that the excited level in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. So R1 = 2 R2.

But the Boltzmann factor gives R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

So R1 = R2 * 2.

So substituting from the Boltzmann expressions,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Let me take natural logs on both sides to make it easier.

ln( exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ) = ln( 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Simplify the left side: ln(exp(x)) = x, so left side is -ΔE/(k T1).

Right side: ln(2) + ln( exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

So putting it together,

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Hmm, rearranging terms.

Let me rewrite this equation:

- (ΔE/(k T1)) + (ΔE/(k T2)) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Wait, I think I have this right. Let me see. So,

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Alternatively,

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) )/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Wait, because (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So substituting,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, I have a factor of (ΔE/k) multiplied by (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) equals ln(2). Hmm, but in the options, I don't see any mention of ΔE or k. So perhaps the equation can be rearranged in terms of T1 and T2.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is seeking an expression in terms of T1 and T2 without ΔE. Or maybe the equation can be rearranged.

Wait, but the given options all involve ln(2) on the left side and an expression of T1 and T2 on the right. So perhaps the equation can be rearranged to solve for ln(2) as a function of T1 and T2.

Wait, let me start over and see. Let me go back.

We have:

R1 = 2 * R2

But R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take natural logs:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]

Bring the ΔE terms to one side:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/(T2) ) - (1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Factor the 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2):

So,

ΔE/(k) * ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

Hmm, but I don't think any option has ΔE or k in it. So perhaps the question is missing some info, but wait, the problem states that the energy difference is given. However, perhaps the equation can be rewritten in terms of the temperatures.

Wait, let me write it as:

(ΔE / (k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

But without knowing ΔE or k, perhaps another approach is needed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to know that the ratio of the populations is given by the Boltzmann factor, and the ratio between the stars is 2:1.

Wait, but the options don't involve ΔE or k, so I must have made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the ratio between the two stars can be expressed as (n1_high / n1_low ) = 2 * (n2_high / n2_low )

Which from the Boltzmann equation gives:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking logarithms:

-ΔE/(k T1) ) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Let me rearrange this:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ] = ln(2 )

Which is what I had before. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can multiply both sides by T1 T2:

ΔE/(k) [ T1 - T2 ] = ln(2) * T1 T2

But I don't see that in the options either. Alternatively, perhaps I can rearrange the equation to get ln(2) in terms of T1 and T2.

Wait, from:

ΔE/(k) * ( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

We can write:

ln(2) = [ ΔE/(k) ] * ( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 )

But the options don't have ΔE or k. Hmm. That suggests I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J, but that's a value of k*T in some cases. Wait, 1.38e-23 J is actually the value of Boltzmann's constant k. Because k ≈ 1.38e-23 J/K.

Wait a second! Oh, right, Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38 × 10^−23 J/K.

So in this problem, the given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k. So ΔE = k.

So substituting that, ΔE = k. So we can write:

ln(2) = [ (ΔE)/(k) ) * ( T1 - T2 ) ] / ( T1 T2 )

But since ΔE = k,

ln(2) = [ (k ) / (k) ) * (T1 - T2) ] / ( T1 T2 )

Simplify k/k to 1:

ln(2) = ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 )

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So that's the correct equation.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through it again.

We have ΔE = k. So substituting into the equation:

ln(2) = [ (ΔE/(k)) ( T1 - T2 ) ] / ( T1 T2 )

Which becomes (k/(k)) = 1, so:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Yes, that's correct. So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. The energy difference between the specific energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), allowing the use of the Boltzmann distribution.

The Boltzmann distribution relates the ratio of populations of two energy states as:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{high}}}{n_{\text{low}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T}\right),
\]

where \( k_B \) is the Boltzmann constant and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the ratios of excited to unexcited atoms are:

\[
R_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_1}\right), \quad R_2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that \( R_1 = 2 R_2 \). Substituting this into the equations for \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \), we get:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k_B} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k_B} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k_B \), this simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

**Answer: D**
