Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars detectable by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, I need to figure out the apparent V magnitude of each star because both ESPRESSO and HIRES have different brightness limits. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES can go down to 16 mag. So a star needs to have an apparent V magnitude (mv) less than or equal to 16 (since brighter means lower mag number) to be detectable by HIRES. For ESPRESSO, it's even more lenient, up to 17, but the star must be detectable by both, so it's limited by the stricter requirement: the star must be brighter than 17 mag, but wait wait. Wait, no. Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitude brighter than 17. So brighter than 17, which is mv <17. Similarly, HIRES can observe brighter than 16, so mv <16. So the star must have mv less than 16 to be seen by both, because that's the stricter condition. Because if a star is brighter than 16, then it's also brighter than 17, so both can see it. But if it's between 16 and 17, then only ESPRESSO can see it, but not HIRES. So for both to detect, the star must have mv ≤16.

Wait, but wait the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO", which means mv <17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so mv <16. So the overlapping condition is mv <16, since that's the stricter requirement. So any star with mv ≤16 can be detected by both. So I'm looking for stars where apparent V magnitude is less than 16.

Let me look at each star and compute their apparent V magnitude.

Star1: Absolute V magnitude (Mv) is 15.5, distance is 10 pc. The formula for apparent magnitude is mv = Mv + 5 log10(d) -5. So d=10, log(10)=1, so 5*1=5. So mv=15.5 +5 -5 =15.5. So mv=15.5. That's less than 16. So Star1 can be detected by both, since 15.5 <16.

Star2: Apparent V mag is given as 16.5. So that's more than 16, so only ESPRESSO can see it, not HIRES. So Star2 is out.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5 mag. But wait, there's also extinction (E(B-V) =0.6 mag). Wait, the note says that the total absorption in V band is related with E(B-V) by a coefficient of 3.1. So the extinction (A_v) is 3.1 * E(B-V). So A_v =3.1 *0.6=1.86 mag.

So the observed apparent magnitude is actually brighter (lower number) than the intrinsic one because of extinction? Wait no, wait. Extinction makes stars appear dimmer (higher magnitude). So the apparent magnitude without extinction is 15.5, but with extinction, it's 15.5 +1.86=17.36 mag. So mv=17.36. So for Star3, after applying extinction, mv=17.36. So that's above 17, so ESPRESSO can't see it either. Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, the question says that Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5. But that's before extinction? Or is that the observed value? Hmm, the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag" and then adds E(B-V). Wait wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the question again.

Star3: RA=11h, DEC=48°, apparent V mag=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, distance 15 pc. The note says that the total absorption in V is 3.1 * E(B-V). So, the star's actual apparent magnitude would be higher due to extinction. Because extinction makes it appear dimmer. So the observed V magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v. So m_intrinsic is 15.5, so m_observed =15.5 +1.86=17.36. So Star3's apparent V is 17.36, which is above 17, so ESPRESSO can't observe it (as ESPRESSO requires mv <17). So Star3 can't be detected by either, I think. So Star3 is out.

Wait wait no. Wait, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the observed one. Oh wait, that might be possible. Let me think. The question says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag." So that's what we observe. But wait, extinction (interstellar dust) affects the observed magnitude. So the observed m is higher (more positive) than the intrinsic because the light is absorbed. So if the star's actual (intrinsic) magnitude is m0, and it has extinction A_v, then the observed m is m0 + A_v. So in Star3's case, the given apparent V mag is 15.5, but that's after extinction. Or is it before? Wait, the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located..." and then adds E(B-V). So perhaps the 15.5 is the observed apparent magnitude. But that's not possible because E(B-V) is used to compute the extinction, which would increase the apparent mag. Alternatively, perhaps the given 15.5 is the apparent magnitude without considering extinction. So the total extinction is A_v=3.1 *0.6=1.86, so the observed apparent magnitude would be m=15.5 +1.86=17.36. So Star3's m is 17.36, which is above 17, so only ESPRESSO can't see it. So Star3 is not detectable by either.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me clarify. The term 'apparent magnitude' is the magnitude as observed, which already includes extinction. So if Star3's apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, that's what we observe, so there's no need to correct for extinction. Wait, but that can't be right because then E(B-V) would be irrelevant. Alternatively, perhaps the given m is the intrinsic, and the E(B-V) is the reddening, meaning the star's light is absorbed, making it appear dimmer (higher m). So the observed m would be higher than 15.5. So in that case, Star3's m would be 15.5 +1.86=17.36, which is above 17, so not detected by ESPRESSO.

Hmm, that's conflicting. Let me read the question again. It says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us." Then, "Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1." So the star's apparent magnitude is given, but the extinction (absorption) is another factor. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because the apparent magnitude already includes extinction.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the 15.5 is the intrinsic magnitude, and the extinction adds to it. So for Star3, the observed m would be 15.5 +1.86=17.36. So it's too faint for both, as both require m <17 and m <16 respectively. So Star3's m=17.36>17, so only ESPRESSO can't detect it. So Star3 can't be detected by either.

But wait, Star5: absolute V magnitude 16.5, distance 5 pc. So compute mv= Mv +5 log10(d/10). d=5, log(0.5)= -0.3010. So 5 * (-0.3010)= -1.505. So mv=16.5 -1.505=14.995 ~15. So mv is about 15. So that's below 16, so HIRES can detect it. And since it's also below 17, ESPRESSO can too. So Star5 is detectable by both.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. d=5 pc, so log10(5/10)=log10(0.5)= -0.3010. So 5 * (-0.3010)= -1.505. So Mv (16.5) + (-1.505)=14.995, so mv≈15.0. That's below 16, so both can detect. So Star5 is a candidate.

Star4: Absolute V mag=15.5, distance=10 pc. So mv=15.5 +5 log10(10/10)=15.5+5*0 =15.5. So mv=15.5. But E(B-V)=0.4, so A_v=3.1 *0.4=1.24. So what's the observed mv? If the given mv is the intrinsic (without extinction), then the observed mv would be 15.5 +1.24=16.74. Oh wait, but wait. The question says the absolute magnitude is 15.5, and the distance is 10 pc. So the apparent magnitude without extinction is 15.5, right? Because mv = Mv when d=10 pc (since the formula is mv = Mv +5 log10(d/10)). So for d=10, log(1)=0, so mv=15.5. But then extinction adds A_v=1.24, so the observed m is 15.5 +1.24=16.74. So that's above 16, so HIRES can't detect it, but it's 16.74 which is above 16 (so HIRES can't), but for ESPRESSO, it's 16.74 >17? No, wait it's less than 17. Wait no, 16.74 is less than 17. Because 17 is the cutoff. Wait, the condition is that ESPRESSO can see stars brighter than 17 mag (mv <17). So 16.74 is less than 17, so ESPRESSO can detect Star4. But HIRES can only detect up to mv <16. So Star4's observed m is 16.74, which is above 16, so HIRES can't see it. So Star4 can't be detected by both.

Wait, but what if I'm misunderstanding the extinction. Let me clarify. The star's absolute magnitude is 15.5. The star is at 10 pc, so without extinction, mv=15.5. But because of extinction, the observed mv is higher: 15.5 +1.24=16.74. So Star4's observed mv is 16.74. So for HIRES, it's 16.74>16, so no. For ESPRESSO, 16.74<17, so yes. So Star4 can be seen by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES. So Star4 is not a candidate.

So let's list out the stars:

Star1: mv=15.5 → detectable by both.

Star2: mv=16.5 → only ESPRESSO (since 16.5<17)

Star3: mv=17.36 → only ESPRESSO (since 17.36 is above 17, so no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 17.36 is higher than 17, so no. So Star3 can't be detected by either.

Wait no, wait, Star3's mv after extinction is 17.36. So the star is fainter than the brightness limit for ESPRESSO (which is mv <17). So ESPRESSO can't see it. So Star3 is out.

Star4: mv=16.74 → ESPRESSO can see it (16.74<17), but HIRES can't (16.74>16). So Star4 can't be detected by both.

Star5: mv=15.0 → detectable by both.

So which stars are detectable by both? Star1 and Star5? Wait, Star1: mv=15.5<16 and <17. So yes. Star5: mv=15<16 and <17.

Wait, but looking at the options:

The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be detected by both.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3 can't.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't (HIRES can't), Star3 can't.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 can, Star4 can only be seen by ESPRESSO.

Wait, no. Wait, Star5 is the only other star that's detectable by both. So which options include Star1 and Star5?

Wait, the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't, only ESPRESSO.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3's m is 17.36, which is too faint for both. So Star3 can't.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2's m=16.5, so detectable by ESPRESSO but not HIRES. Star3 can't. So no.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 can be detected by both, Star4 can be detected only by ESPRESSO. So no.

Wait, that's confusing. Because according to my analysis, only Star1 and Star5 can be detected by both. But looking at the options, none have that. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with Star5. Let's recalculate.

Star5: Mv=16.5, d=5 pc.

mv = Mv +5 log10(d/10) =16.5 +5 log10(0.5)=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995, which is approximately 15.0. So mv=15.0. So it's below both 16 and 17, so detectable by both.

So the stars detectable by both are Star1 and Star5. But looking at the options:

Looking back at the options:

Option A: 4 and 5 → Star4 can't.

Option B: 3 and 5 → Star3 can't.

Option D: 1 and 4 → Star4 can't.

Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me re-examine each star.

Wait, Star2's mv is 16.5. It's given as apparent V magnitude, so no extinction. So Star2's mv=16.5. So for HIRES, it's 16.5>16, so no. But for ESPRESSO, 16.5 <17, so yes. So Star2 can't be seen by both.

Star3: after extinction, mv=17.36, so can't be seen by either.

Star4: after extinction, mv=16.74, so ESPRESSO can, HIRES can't.

Star5: mv=15.0 → both can.

Star1: mv=15.5 → both can.

So which options match? The only stars detectable by both are Star1 and Star5. But looking at the options, none of the options pair them. Let's see the options again.

The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Only Star5 is good.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3 is bad.

C) Star2 and Star3 → both bad.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 is good, Star4 is bad.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake. Because according to the options, none has both Star1 and Star5. Did I miss any star?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with Star3. Let me reevaluate Star3.

Star3: RA=11h, DEC=48°, apparent V mag=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, distance 15 pc.

So the star's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but we have to account for extinction. The E(B-V) is 0.6, so A_v=3.1 *0.6=1.86.

Wait, but wait, the apparent magnitude already includes the extinction. Because apparent magnitude is what's observed. So if the observed m is 15.5, but the star's actual (intrinsic) magnitude is brighter because of extinction. No, that's not right. Extinction makes stars appear dimmer, so if the star's actual (intrinsic) magnitude is m0, then observed m is m0 + A_v. So if the observed m is 15.5, then the intrinsic m would be 15.5 - A_v=15.5 -1.86=13.64. But that's not relevant because in our case, we're given the observed m. So for Star3, the observed m is 15.5, which is below 16, so both can detect it?

Wait that can't be. Because if the extinction is present, wouldn't that make the star appear dimmer, leading to a higher m. So perhaps I was wrong to think that the given m is the observed. Maybe the given m is the intrinsic, and the extinction makes it appear dimmer. So then the observed m would be higher.

Wait, but the question states that Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5. Apparent magnitude is the observed, which includes any extinction. So if the observed m is 15.5, and A_v is 1.86, then the intrinsic m is 15.5 -1.86=13.64. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the observed m would be higher than the intrinsic. Because extinction makes stars appear dimmer.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this backward. The formula is:

m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v.

So if a star's intrinsic (absolute) magnitude is Mv, then the apparent magnitude without extinction is mv_intrinsic = Mv +5 log10(d/10). Then, with extinction, mv_observed= mv_intrinsic + A_v.

So for Star3, the given apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is the observed. So:

mv_observed = (Mv +5 log10(d/10)) + A_v.

Wait no, wait. Wait, that would be if the given Mv is the absolute magnitude. But Star3's given Mv is not provided; the given apparent magnitude is. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternative approach: For each star, compute their apparent magnitude as observed, considering extinction. If the observed m is less than 16, they can be detected by both.

So for each star:

Star1: Mv=15.5, d=10 pc. No extinction (E(B-V)=0?), so mv =15.5 +5 log10(10/10)=15.5. So mv=15.5. So yes, detectable by both.

Star2: apparent V mag=16.5, E(B-V)=0? So no extinction. So mv=16.5. So for HIRES, 16.5>16 → no. For ESPRESSO, 16.5<17 → yes. So only ESPRESSO can see it.

Star3: apparent V mag=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So A_v=1.86. Wait, but given that the apparent V mag already includes extinction, so mv_observed=15.5. So the total extinction would actually have made it dimmer, so the actual (intrinsic) m would be 15.5 -1.86=13.64. But that's not relevant because the question gives the observed m as 15.5. So Star3's observed m is 15.5, which is less than 16. So both can detect it. Wait, that would change things.

Wait, this is the crux. If the apparent magnitude given already includes extinction (so it's the observed m), then Star3's mv is 15.5, which is within both's limits. So Star3 can be detected by both.

But wait, the question says Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. That suggests that the extinction is present, so the observed m should be higher. So perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me think again.

Perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic, and then we have to add extinction to get the observed. So for Star3:

Intrinsic mv =15.5.

A_v=3.1*0.6=1.86.

Observed mv =15.5 +1.86=17.36.

So Star3's observed mv is 17.36, which is above 17, so not detectable by either.

But that contradicts the previous approach where the given mv is the observed. So which is correct?

The question says: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1."

So the apparent V mag is the observed magnitude. So the extinction (A_v) is 1.86. So the observed m is 15.5. Because the observed m is already after extinction. Because the star's observed (apparent) magnitude is 15.5, including any extinction.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because the extinction makes the star appear dimmer, so the observed m is higher than the star's intrinsic m. So if the observed m is 15.5, and A_v is positive, then the intrinsic m would be lower.

Wait, but maybe the question is providing the star's absolute magnitude, not the apparent. Let me check.

Wait, Star3's parameters: RA=11h, DEC=48°, apparent V mag=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, distance 15 pc.

Ah, no. The apparent V mag is given, which already includes extinction. Because apparent magnitude is what we observe, which includes any interstellar extinction. So the E(B-V) is additional information, perhaps to compute the distance modulus differently?

Wait, no. The distance modulus is based on the star's absolute magnitude and distance. So for Star3, if its apparent magnitude is 15.5, but it's actually at 15 pc, then without extinction, its absolute magnitude would be Mv = mv -5 log10(d/10) = 15.5 -5 log10(1.5) =15.5 -5*(0.1761)=15.5 -0.8805=14.6195. So Mv≈14.62. But with E(B-V)=0.6, perhaps the Mv is different? No, because Mv is the absolute magnitude, which is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc, without extinction.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach each star methodically.

Let me create a table:

Star | Mv (abs) | d (pc) | Apparent mv (obs) | E(B-V) | A_v (3.1 * E) | Corrected mv? | Detectable by both?
-----|---------|-------|------------------|--------|--------------|---------------|-------------------
1 | 15.5 | 10 | 15.5 | 0 | 0 | 15.5 | Yes
2 | - | - | 16.5 | - | - | 16.5 | No (HIRES can't)
3 | - | 15 | 15.5 | 0.6 | 1.86 | ? | ?
4 | 15.5 | 10 | 15.5 | 0.4 | 1.24 | ? | ?
5 | 16.5 |5 |15.0 |0 |0 |15.0 |Yes

Wait, for Star1, it's straightforward. Mv=15.5, d=10, so mv=15.5. No extinction. So mv=15.5. Detectable by both.

Star2: apparent mv=16.5. No extinction info (E(B-V) not given?), so no extinction. So mv=16.5. Detectable by ESPRESSO (since <17) but not HIRES. So no.

Star3: apparent mv=15.5. E(B-V)=0.6. So A_v=1.86. But since apparent mv already includes extinction, the observed mv is 15.5, which is correct. So Star3 is detectable by both.

Wait, but that can't be right because the extinction would cause the star to appear dimmer, so the observed mv would be higher. So if the star's actual (intrinsic) mv is m0, then observed mv is m0 + A_v. So if that's the case, then the given mv=15.5 is the observed, which already includes the extinction. So the intrinsic mv would be 15.5 -1.86=13.64. But in that case, the star's distance is 15 pc. So what's the absolute magnitude?

Mv = mv_intrinsic - 5 log10(d/10) =13.64 -5 log10(1.5) =13.64 -5*(0.1761)=13.64 -0.88=12.76. But perhaps that's irrelevant because the question doesn't ask about absolute magnitude but detectability.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is, for detectability, the observed apparent magnitude (which includes any extinction) must be less than 16 for HIRES and less than 17 for ESPRESSO.

So for Star3, the observed mv is 15.5, which is below 16. So it can be detected by both.

Wait, but how? Because the E(B-V) suggests that the star is reddened, making it appear dimmer, so the observed mv is higher. But if the given mv is 15.5, that's already after extinction, so it's correct. So Star3’s observed mv is 15.5. So it can be detected by both.

So Star3 is detectable by both.

Wait, but that would change things. Let me recast the analysis:

Star1: mv=15.5 → detectable by both.

Star3: mv=15.5 → detectable by both.

Star5: mv=15.0 → detectable by both.

Star4: mv=15.5 +1.24=16.74 → only ESPRESSO.

So now, which stars are detectable by both: Star1, Star3, Star5.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both detectable.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't.

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't.

So option B would be the correct answer.

Wait, but according to this, Star3 is detectable by both. But earlier I thought Star3's observed mv is 17.36. Now I'm getting confused.

Let me clarify once and for all.

The question says: for Star3, the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. So the total absorption (A_v=3.1*0.6=1.86). But how does that affect the observed mv?

If the star's true (intrinsic) apparent magnitude is m0, then the observed m is m0 + A_v.

But the question gives the observed apparent magnitude as 15.5, so that already includes A_v.

So m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v → 15.5 = m_intrinsic + 1.86 → m_intrinsic=15.5-1.86=13.64.

But that's the intrinsic apparent magnitude. The absolute magnitude Mv is defined as the apparent magnitude at 10 pc. So using the distance modulus:

Mv = m_intrinsic -5 log10(d/10).

d=15 pc, so log10(15/10)=log10(1.5)=0.176.

So Mv=13.64 -5*(0.176)=13.64 -0.88=12.76.

But that's not directly relevant because the detectability is based on the observed mv, which is 15.5. So if Star3's observed mv is 15.5, then both can detect it.

Therefore, Star3 can be detected by both.

So which stars are detectable by both?

Star1: mv=15.5 → yes.

Star3: mv=15.5 → yes.

Star5: mv=15.0 → yes.

So the options are:

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both detectable.

Another option is that Star1 is also detectable, but the options don't include combinations with Star1 and others.

Wait, but the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4's mv is 16.74, so not detectable by both.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both detectable.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2's mv=16.5 → only ESPRESSO.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't.

So the correct answer would be option B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but earlier I thought Star3's observed mv is 15.5, which is below 16, so yes. Star5's mv=15.0, also yes.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in Star3's analysis, and Star3's observed mv is 17.36. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent V magnitude is the intrinsic, and the extinction needs to be added to get the observed. So for Star3, the observed mv would be 15.5 +1.86=17.36, which is above 17, so only detectable by ESPRESSO if that's the case.

But the question says Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5. So I think the correct approach is that the observed mv is 15.5, which is already after considering extinction. So Star3 is detectable by both.

So the correct answer would be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars, considering the detection limits of the instruments. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., \( m_v < 17 \)), while HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag (i.e., \( m_v < 16 \)). Therefore, a star must have \( m_v < 16 \) to be detectable by both instruments.

### Analysis of Each Star:

#### **Star1**  
- Absolute V magnitude (\( M_v \)) = 15.5  
- Distance = 10 pc  
- Apparent V magnitude (\( m_v \)) = \( M_v + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(1) = 15.5 \).  
- \( m_v = 15.5 \), which is less than 16.  
- **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.**

#### **Star2**  
- Apparent V magnitude (\( m_v \)) = 16.5  
- \( m_v = 16.5 \), which is greater than 16.  
- **Not detectable by HIRES, but detectable by ESPRESSO.**

#### **Star3**  
- Apparent V magnitude (\( m_v \)) = 15.5  
- \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \), so total absorption in the V band (\( A_v \)) = \( 3.1 \times 0.6 = 1.86 \).  
- The observed \( m_v \) already includes extinction, so no further correction is needed.  
- \( m_v = 15.5 \), which is less than 16.  
- **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.**

#### **Star4**  
- Absolute V magnitude (\( M_v \)) = 15.5  
- Distance = 10 pc  
- Apparent V magnitude without extinction (\( m_v \)) = \( M_v + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(1) = 15.5 \).  
- \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \), so \( A_v = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24 \).  
- Observed \( m_v = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 \), which is greater than 16.  
- **Not detectable by HIRES, but detectable by ESPRESSO.**

#### **Star5**  
- Absolute V magnitude (\( M_v \)) = 16.5  
- Distance = 5 pc  
- Apparent V magnitude (\( m_v \)) = \( M_v + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(0.5) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0 \).  
- \( m_v = 15.0 \), which is less than 16.  
- **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.**

### Conclusion:
The stars detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1**, **Star3**, and **Star5**. Among the given options, only **Star3 and Star5** satisfy the condition for both instruments.
