Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a diatomic molecule, made up of atoms X and Y. They’re using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon it absorbs to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Hmm, wait. So the molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that for rotation-vibration models, the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule must transition to the next higher energy state. But wait, I'm supposed to find the photon's momentum, not energy directly.

Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the next higher energy level. But in terms of quantum transitions, for a diatomic molecule, the energy levels are quantized for both rotation and vibration.

I think the energy levels for a diatomic molecule in the rotation-vibration model can be approximated by considering both the vibrational and rotational contributions. The total energy is the sum of the vibrational energy and the rotational energy.

The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next state would involve either a change in vibrational state or a change in rotational state. But wait, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (n + 1/2) h nu, where nu is the frequency.

Wait, but the question says the model is non-rigid, but I'm not entirely sure how that changes things. Oh, the non-rigid rotor accounts for bond length changes due to vibration, but for the purpose of finding the photon's momentum, maybe I can treat it similarly to the rigid rotor model for this calculation, or perhaps the non-rigid aspect just affects the rotational constant.

But maybe the problem is more about the photon causing a transition to the next higher energy state, regardless of whether it's a vibrational or rotational change. But wait, in the case of the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0), the next higher state could be either n=1 (vibrational) or J=1 (rotational). Which one has a lower energy transition?

Wait, perhaps the energy required for the rotational transition is lower than the vibrational one. Because vibrational transitions usually have higher energy than rotational. So the photon would need to supply the energy difference between J=0 and J=1, or between n=0 and n=1. But which transition is possible first.

Wait, but the question says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So which transition requires less energy? That is, which transition has a lower energy difference.

Let me think about the energies involved. The vibrational energy difference between n=0 and n=1 would be delta E_vib = (1 + 1/2 - 0 - 1/2) h nu = h nu. Because E_vib for n=0 is (0 + 1/2) h nu, and for n=1 it's (1 + 1/2) h nu. So the difference is h nu.

For the rotational transition, from J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is E_rot = B (1)(1+1) - B (0)(0+1) ) = 2B - 0 = 2B. So delta E_rot = 2B.

So which one is bigger, 2B or h nu? That would determine which transition requires less energy.

Wait, but the problem gives me the angular frequency of vibration, w. So nu = w/(2 pi). So the energy per photon would be E_photon = h c / lambda = h nu.

Wait, but the photon's energy would have to match the energy difference between the initial and final states. Since the initial state is the ground state (J=0, n=0), the next possible state with the lowest energy would be either J=1, n=0 (rotational) or J=0, n=1 (vibrational). Whichever requires less energy.

So I need to calculate both delta E_vib and delta E_rot and see which is smaller.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the momentum of the photon. So perhaps I need to calculate the energy first and then relate it to the momentum.

But photons have energy E = pc, where p is momentum. So once I find the energy required, I can find p = E / c.

So first, I need to compute both delta E_vib and delta E_rot, and see which one is smaller. The photon's energy will correspond to the lower of these two.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the molecule can actually make a transition to the next lowest state. Because in the rigid rotor model, the allowed rotational transitions are delta J = ±1. Similarly, vibrational transitions usually have delta n = ±1. But perhaps the molecule can make a transition either way, but which is lower in energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the next state is the first excited state, which could be either a vibrational or a rotational transition. But the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy", so perhaps it's the one with the smaller energy difference.

So which is smaller: 2B or h nu?

Let me compute B first.

The rotational constant B is given by (hbar^2) / (2 I c^2), but wait, no, I think the rotational energy levels are E_rot = (J (J+1) hbar² )/( 2 I ), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, the rotational constant B is given by h c B_rot, where B_rot is (h^2)/(8 pi^2 I c^2), but I'm getting a bit confused. Hmm, perhaps another approach is better.

Wait, the moment of inertia I is given by I = mu * r^2, where mu is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

Yes, so first, compute mu.

mu = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) , where Mx and My are the masses in kg.

But given Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. So total mass is 22 amu. So mu = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) ) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 amu. Hmm, 20/11 is approximately 1.818 amu.

But wait, 1 amu is 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So mu = (20/11) * 1.6605e-27 kg. Let me compute that.

20/11 ≈ 1.818. So 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 2.99e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately: 20 amu is 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg. Similarly, My is 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg. So mu = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27) ) ?

Wait, no. Wait, mu is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). So Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So (20 * 2) / (20 +2 ) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

So mu = 1.81818 amu = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 2.999e-27 kg.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it exactly.

mu = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) ) * 1.6605e-27 kg

= (40 / 22) * 1.6605e-27 kg

= (20/11) * 1.6605e-27 kg

20 ÷ 11 is approximately 1.81818. So 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 2.999e-27 kg. Let's say approximately 3.0e-27 kg.

Then, I = mu * r^2. The bond length r is 2 angstroms, which is 2 * 1e-10 meters = 2e-10 m.

So I = 3.0e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0e-27 * 4e-20 = 12e-47 kg m². Wait, 3e-27 * 4e-20 = 12e-47, which is 1.2e-46 kg m².

Now, the rotational constant B is given by (h^2) / (8 pi^2 I c^2 ), but wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The energy levels are E_rot = (J (J+1) ) ħ² / (2I ), but sometimes B is defined as h c B_rot, where B_rot is ħ² / (2 I c^2 ), or something like that. Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the rotational energy levels in terms of wavenumbers or something else.

Alternatively, the rotational constant B is given by h/(8 pi² c I), and the energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1) in wavenumbers, but not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me compute the rotational constant B. B is defined as h / (8 pi² I c ), right? Because B = h/(8 pi² I c ), which has units of cm^-1, a wavenumber.

Wait, let me check. The rotational energy levels in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1) are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = h / (8 pi^2 I c ). So that's correct.

So let me compute B.

I = 1.2e-46 kg m².

But wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recompute I.

mu = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) ) amu = 40/22 amu = 20/11 amu ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 2.999e-27 kg.

r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

I = mu * r² = 2.999e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 2.999e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.1996e-46 kg m². Let's say approximately 1.2e-46 kg m².

So B = h / (8 pi² I c )

h is Planck's constant, which is 6.62607015e-34 J s.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

So plug in the numbers.

B = (6.626e-34) / (8 * (pi)^2 * 1.2e-46 * 3e8 )

Compute denominator: 8 * pi^2 is about 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

So denominator is 78.9568 * 1.2e-46 * 3e8.

Wait, 78.9568 * 1.2e-46 ≈ 94.748e-46 = 9.4748e-45.

Then multiply by 3e8: 9.4748e-45 * 3e8 = 2.8424e-36.

So denominator is 2.8424e-36.

So B = 6.626e-34 / 2.8424e-36 ≈ (6.626 / 2.8424) * 1e2 ≈ approximately 2.329 * 100 ≈ 232.9 cm^-1.

Wait, that's a very high rotational constant. That can't be right because typical rotational constants for diatomic molecules are on the order of cm^-1, but 232 cm^-1 seems high. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Let me check the exponents.

B = h/(8 pi² I c )

I = 1.2e-46 kg m².

So denominator: 8 pi² * I * c = 8 * (pi)^2 * 1.2e-46 * 3e8.

Wait, 8 * pi^2 ≈ 78.9568.

78.9568 * 1.2e-46 = 94.748e-46 = 9.4748e-45.

Multiply by 3e8: 9.4748e-45 * 3e8 = 2.84244e-36.

So denominator is 2.84244e-36.

h is 6.626e-34. So 6.626e-34 / 2.84244e-36 ≈ (6.626 / 2.84244) * 1e2 ≈ 2.329 * 1e2 = 232.9 cm^-1.

Hmm, that's a high value but perhaps correct for a light molecule.

Wait, but the bond length is 2 angstroms, which is on the shorter side, making I small, leading to a larger B, since B is inversely proportional to I.

If B is 232.9 cm^-1, then the rotational energy difference from J=0 to J=1 is 2B (since E_rot = B J (J+1) ), so delta E_rot = 2B = 465.8 cm^-1.

But the vibrational energy difference is h nu. The angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. So nu = w/(2 pi) ≈ (4e14)/(6.283) ≈ ~6.366e13 Hz.

So E_vib = h nu = 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 ≈ 4.22e-20 J.

But wait, E_vib is the energy per photon. Alternatively, in wavenumbers (cm^-1), E_vib = nu (in cm^-1) times hc.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between frequency and wavenumber.

Wait, the vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (n + 1/2) h nu, where nu is the vibrational frequency. So the energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is h nu.

So let me compute h nu.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

nu = w/(2 pi) = (4e14) / (2 * 3.1416) ≈ 4e14 / 6.283 ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

So E_vib = h * nu = 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 ≈ 4.22e-20 J.

Let me compute that: 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 = 6.626 *6.366 = approx 42.22, so 42.22e-21 → 4.222e-20 J.

Now, compute delta E_rot in Joules.

B is 232.9 cm^-1, which is 232.9 / (100 cm) = 2.329e-3 m^-1.

Wait, E_rot = B J (J+1) in cm^-1, but to get energy in Joules, E_rot = h c B J (J+1).

Wait, because 1 cm^-1 corresponds to h c / (1 cm), so E = (h c) * (B in cm^-1) * J (J+1).

Alternatively, since B is in cm^-1, E_rot (in J) = h c * B * J (J+1).

Wait, let me compute that.

h c is 6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

But since B is in cm^-1, we need to convert B to m^-1: 232.9 cm^-1 = 2329 m^-1.

Wait, no. 1 cm^-1 is 100 m^-1. So 232.9 cm^-1 is 232.9 * 100 m^-1 = 23290 m^-1.

So E_rot (J) = h c * B * J (J+1) = 1.9878e-25 J·m * 23290 m^-1 * J (J+1).

For J=0: E_rot = 0.

J=1: E_rot = 1.9878e-25 * 23290 * 2 = 1.9878e-25 * 46580 ≈ 9.28e-21 J.

So delta E_rot is approximately 9.28e-21 J.

Comparing delta E_vib and delta E_rot. E_vib was 4.22e-20 J, delta E_rot is 9.28e-21 J.

So delta E_rot (9.28e-21 J) is less than delta E_vib (4.22e-20 J). So the photon would need to have energy equal to delta E_rot, which is lower.

Wait, but wait. The question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the ground state for both rotation (J=0) and vibration (n=0). So the next possible state with the lowest energy would be the one requiring the least energy. So in this case, the rotational transition is possible with less energy, so the photon's energy would be 9.28e-21 J.

But wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because the rotational energy difference for J=0 → J=1 is 2B, but perhaps in terms of energy, the transition would require that.

But another possibility is that the molecule can absorb a photon that causes a transition from (J=0, n=0) to (J=1, n=0), which is a rotational transition, or to (J=0, n=1), which is a vibrational transition. Which requires less energy.

So if delta E_rot (9.28e-21 J) is less than delta E_vib (4.22e-20 J), then the photon's energy would be 9.28e-21 J.

But wait, the question says the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model. I'm not sure if that affects the calculation. But I think for the purpose of this problem, the non-rigid aspect isn't directly changing the way we compute the energy difference, so perhaps I can proceed.

So the energy required is delta E = 9.28e-21 J.

The photon's momentum p is related to its energy by E = p c. So p = E / c.

So p = 9.28e-21 J / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 3.09e-29 kg·m/s. Wait, that seems a very small number, but let's compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute using the energy in terms of delta E_rot.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me check again.

Wait, the calculation of B as 232.9 cm^-1 seems high. Maybe I made a mistake in the denominator.

Wait, I = mu * r^2.

mu = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) ) = (20 amu * 2 amu)/(22 amu) ) = 40/22 amu = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

r is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m.

So I = 1.818 amu * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg, so 1.818 amu = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 2.999e-27 kg.

I = 2.999e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 2.999e-27 *4e-20 = 1.1996e-46 kg m².

So, B = h/(8 pi² I c )

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

8 pi² ≈ 78.9568.

I c = 1.1996e-46 kg m² * 3e8 m/s = 3.5988e-38 kg m²/s.

So denominator is 78.9568 * 3.5988e-38 = let's compute that.

78.9568 * 3.5988e-38 ≈ 78.9568 * 3.5988 = approx 283.12e-38? Wait, wait, no: 78.9568 * 3.5988e-38 = (78.9568 * 3.5988) *1e-38.

Compute 78.9568 *3.5988 ≈ let's say approximately 283.12.

So denominator ≈ 283.12e-38 → 2.8312e-36.

Then B = 6.626e-34 / 2.8312e-36 ≈ (6.626 / 2.8312) * 1e2 ≈ 2.339 * 100 → 233.9 cm^-1.

So that's consistent with the previous calculation. So delta E_rot is 2*B*h*c.

Wait, no, delta E_rot is 2B in terms of wavenumbers, but to get energy, I think I should compute E = h c (2B).

Wait, no, because E_rot = B J (J+1), so the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2B * h c, because each B is in wavenumbers (cm^-1), and energy is E = h c (B J (J+1)).

Wait, no, E_rot (J) is given by E_rot = h c B J (J+1).

So for J=0, E_rot is 0. For J=1, E_rot = h c B (1)(2) = 2 h c B.

So delta E_rot = 2 h c B.

Wait, but earlier I computed B as 232.9 cm^-1. So 2B is 465.8 cm^-1.

So delta E_rot = h c (2B) = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s)(465.8 / 100 m^-1 )

Wait, wait, wait. B is 232.9 cm^-1, which is 2329 m^-1.

Wait, no: cm^-1 is 1e-2 m^-1. So 232.9 cm^-1 = 2329 m^-1.

So 2B = 465.8 cm^-1 = 4658 m^-1.

So E_rot = h c (2B) = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s)(4658 m^-1 )

Compute that:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Multiply by 4658 m^-1:

1.9878e-25 J·m * 4658 m^-1 = 1.9878e-25 * 4658 * 1e-0 J.

So 1.9878e-25 * 4658 ≈ let's compute 1.9878 *4658 ≈ approx 9.28e3 → 9.28e3 * 1e-25 = 9.28e-22 J.

Wait, that's 9.28e-22 J. Earlier I thought it was 9.28e-21 J. Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the exponent.

Wait, 1e-25 * 4658 is 4.658e-22. So 1.9878e-25 *4658 = 1.9878 *4658 * 1e-25.

1.9878 *4658 ≈ approx 9286. So 9286e-25 → 9.286e-22 J.

So delta E_rot is approximately 9.286e-22 J.

Wait, earlier I had delta E_vib as 4.22e-20 J, which is about 42.2e-21 J. So delta E_rot is much smaller, about 9.28e-22 J, which is about 0.0928e-20 J, or about 9.28e-22 J.

So the photon's energy should be about 9.28e-22 J.

Then, p = E / c = (9.28e-22 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.09e-30 kg·m/s.

Wait, that's a very small momentum. But the options given are in the range of 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns.

Wait, 1 Ns is 1 kg·m/s. So 3.09e-30 kg·m/s is 3.09e-30 Ns, which is 3.09e-30 N s. But the options don't have anything that small. So perhaps I did something wrong in the calculation.

Wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of delta E_rot.

Wait, delta E_rot is 2B in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1), which is 2 * 232.9 = 465.8 cm^-1.

But to get the energy, E_rot (J) = h c (delta E_rot in cm^-1).

So delta E_rot (cm^-1) = 465.8 cm^-1.

So E_rot = h c * (465.8 cm^-1) → h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

But 1 cm^-1 corresponds to (h c) / (1 cm) → 1.9878e-25 J·m / 0.01 m = 1.9878e-23 J.

Wait, no. Let me compute E_rot correctly.

E_rot (J) = (h c) * (465.8 cm^-1) * (1 m / 100 cm) )

Wait, no. 1 cm^-1 is 1 / cm = 100 m^-1.

So E_rot = h c * (465.8 cm^-1) = h c * 465.8 * (1 m^-1 / 100 )

So E_rot = h c * 465.8 / 100 m^-1.

Compute that.

h c is 1.9878e-25 J·m.

So E_rot = 1.9878e-25 J·m * (465.8 / 100) m^-1.

Which is 1.9878e-25 * 4.658 = 9.28e-25 J.

Wait, 1.9878e-25 *4.658 → approximately 1.9878 *4.658 ≈ 9.28, so 9.28e-25 J.

So delta E_rot is 9.28e-25 J.

Wait, but earlier I thought delta E_vib was 4.22e-20 J, which is much larger. So the photon's energy would be 9.28e-25 J.

Then, the photon's momentum p = E / c = 9.28e-25 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.09e-33 kg·m/s, which is 3.09e-33 Ns. But the options are much larger, from ~1e-28 Ns up. So this doesn't match any option.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me rethink.

Wait, perhaps the model being non-rigid changes the way the rotational and vibrational energies are treated. But I'm not sure how. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for a vibrational transition, not a rotational one.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question refers to a transition where both rotational and vibrational changes occur, but the lowest possible energy change. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule's next state is the first vibrational excited state (n=1), because the rotational transitions are allowed but require lower energy, but perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition.

Wait, let me check the given options.

Options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

So the options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range.

Wait, earlier I thought the delta E_rot is about 9.28e-25 J. Let's compute p = E/c.

p = 9.28e-25 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.09e-33 kg m/s = 3.09e-33 Ns. But this is way below the options.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps my approach to B is incorrect. Let's try another way.

The rotational constant B is given by B = (h^2)/(8 pi^2 I c^2 ), which is in units of energy per angular momentum squared, but I think I'm mixing up units here.

Wait, perhaps the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (J (J+1) hbar^2 )/(2 I ), where hbar is the reduced Planck constant.

So, E_rot = (J (J+1) (hbar)^2) / (2 I )

hbar = h/(2 pi) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So, E_rot = (J (J+1) (1.0545718e-34)^2 ) / (2 * I )

I is 1.2e-46 kg m².

So for J=1, E_rot = (2 * (1.0545718e-34)^2 ) / (2 * 1.2e-46)

Simplify: 2 and 2 cancel.

E_rot = ( (1.0545718e-34)^2 ) / (1.2e-46 )

Compute numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 1.2e-46.

So E_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.2e-46 ≈ 9.267e-23 J.

So delta E_rot is approximately 9.267e-23 J.

Then, p = E / c = 9.267e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.089e-31 kg m/s = 3.089e-31 Ns. Still way too small compared to the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the vibrational energy transition instead.

Compute delta E_vib = h nu = 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 ≈ 4.22e-20 J.

Then p = E/c = 4.22e-20 / 3e8 ≈ 1.407e-28 kg m/s = 1.407e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns. That's very close.

So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the vibrational transition, not the rotational one.

But why would the rotational transition require less energy but the options don't have that? Because the photon's momentum is based on the vibrational energy, which is higher.

Wait, but in the given options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns, which matches the calculation for the vibrational transition.

But earlier analysis suggested that the rotational transition requires less energy (9.28e-22 J) compared to the vibrational (4.22e-20 J).

But according to this, the photon's energy would have to be 4.22e-20 J, leading to p = 1.4e-28 Ns.

So perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but in that case, why is the rotational transition's energy lower? Because delta E_rot is 9.28e-22 J, which is less than 4.22e-20 J.

So why is the photon's energy 4.22e-20 J instead of 9.28e-22 J?

Unless I made a mistake in assuming which transition is allowed. Perhaps in the quantum model, the rotational and vibrational transitions are separate, and the molecule can't transition to a higher vibrational state unless it's in a higher rotational state. Or vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state, which could be either vibrational or rotational, but the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy."

But if the rotational transition requires less energy, why is the photon's energy higher in the options?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy.

Wait, when J=0, E_rot =0.

When J=1, E_rot = (1)(2) [ (hbar)^2/(2I) ) ]

Which is 2 * [ (hbar^2)/(2I) ) ] = hbar^2 / I.

So E_rot = hbar^2 / I.

hbar = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

hbar^2 = approx 1.112e-68 J²·s².

I = 1.2e-46 kg m².

So E_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.2e-46 ≈ 9.267e-23 J.

So delta E_rot is 9.267e-23 J.

Which is 9.267e-23 J.

Which is much lower than delta E_vib.

But the options don't have anything near 3e-31 Ns, which is what I calculated for delta E_rot.

But the option D is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is from the vibrational transition.

So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is implying that the molecule is in the fundamental vibrational state (n=0) but in the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next state would be the first vibrational state (n=1), which would have higher energy than the rotational transition.

But why would the question ask for the next state with the lowest possible energy? Because the rotational transition is lower in energy.

Wait, but perhaps the model being non-rigid means that the rotational and vibrational energies are coupled, so the energy levels are not as straightforward. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state, which could be the first rotational state (J=1) or the first vibrational state (n=1). It would have to compute which transition is allowed and which has lower energy.

But according to my calculations, the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's momentum should be based on that.

But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of delta E_rot.

Wait, let me recalculate E_rot.

E_rot = (J (J+1) hbar^2 )/(2 I )

For J=1, E_rot = (2) * (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.2e-46)

= (2 * (1.112e-68)) / (2.4e-46 )

= (2.224e-68) / (2.4e-46) = 9.267e-23 J.

Yes, that's correct.

So delta E_rot is 9.267e-23 J.

Then, p = E/c = 9.267e-23 / 3e8 = 3.089e-31 kg m/s =3.089e-31 Ns.

But looking at the options, the smallest is D:1.4e-28 Ns, which is much larger than 3e-31.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B earlier.

Wait, perhaps B is supposed to be in terms of frequency, not wavenumber. Let me think.

Wait, no, B is typically in cm^-1, which is a wavenumber.

Another approach: maybe the question is not considering the rotational transition but only the vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps the molecule cannot change its rotational state because it's in the ground state and the transition is forbidden. Or perhaps the question is considering only vibrational transitions.

But I thought in the rigid rotor, rotational transitions are allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps the model being non-rigid implies that the bond length can change, which affects the moment of inertia, but perhaps it's not affecting the calculation for this question.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy difference between the (J=0, n=0) state and the (J=1, n=0) state, which is a rotational transition, and compare it with (J=0, n=1) which is a vibrational transition.

But according to my calculations, the rotational transition requires less energy, so the photon's energy should match that.

But since the options don't match that, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that the question is considering only the vibrational transition.

So perhaps the correct answer is option D, 1.4e-28 Ns.

But why would the rotational transition, which requires less energy, not be the answer? Because perhaps the question is only considering the vibrational transition, not the rotational one.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the next state, which is (n=1, J=0), which is a vibrational transition.

But why would that be the case, since the rotational transition is lower in energy.

Hmm, maybe I should recheck the energy levels.

Wait, perhaps the rotational and vibrational energy levels are such that the first excited state is a vibrational transition, as rotational transitions may not be allowed from J=0 to J=1.

No, I think that in the rigid rotor model, rotational transitions are allowed when delta J=±1. So from J=0 to J=1 is allowed.

But perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the treatment is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simplifying and only considering the vibrational transition, perhaps because the rotational transition is a higher energy state.

Wait, but my calculations show the opposite. Let me recheck:

delta E_rot ≈ 9.267e-23 J → p ≈ 3.089e-31 Ns.

delta E_vib ≈ 4.22e-20 J → p ≈ 1.407e-28 Ns.

But the options only go down to 1e-28 Ns.

Option D is 1.4e-28, which matches the vibrational transition.

So perhaps the correct answer is D.

But why is the rotational transition not considered? Maybe because the problem is referring to a transition that can't be a rotational one, perhaps because it's a diatomic molecule and the question focuses on the vibration.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy required to transition the molecule to the next state without specifying whether it's rotational or vibrational, but just the next state in the combined energy levels. Which would be the lower energy transition.

But in that case, the rotational transition is lower, but the options don't have that value. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute the vibrational transition.

So considering all this, I think the correct answer is option D, 1.4e-28 Ns.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the rotational and vibrational energy differences.

### Key Information:
1. **Masses**:  
   - \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \), \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)  
   - Reduced mass:  
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
     \]  
     Converting to kilograms:  
     \[
     \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 2.999 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
     \]

2. **Bond Length**:  
   \( r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \).  

3. **Moment of Inertia**:  
   \[
   I = \mu \cdot r^2 = 2.999 \times 10^{-27} \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.1996 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
   \]

4. **Rotational Constant \( B \)**:  
   Using \( B = \frac{h}{8 \pi^2 I c} \):  
   \[
   B = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{8 \pi^2 \cdot 1.1996 \times 10^{-46} \cdot 3 \times 10^8}.
   \]  
   Denominator:  
   \[
   8 \pi^2 \approx 78.9568, \quad 78.9568 \cdot 1.1996 \times 10^{-46} \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \approx 2.8424 \times 10^{-36}.
   \]  
   \[
   B \approx \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{2.8424 \times 10^{-36}} \approx 232.9 \, \text{cm}^{-1}.
   \]

5. **Energy Difference for Rotational Transition**:  
   The rotational energy levels are \( E_{\text{rot}} = B J (J+1) \). For \( J = 0 \to J = 1 \):  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = E_{\text{rot}}(J=1) - E_{\text{rot}}(J=0) = 2B.
   \]  
   Converting \( B \) to energy:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2 \cdot h c B = 2 \cdot 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 232.9 \, \text{cm}^{-1}.
   \]  
   \( 1 \, \text{cm}^{-1} = 100 \, \text{m}^{-1} \), so:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2 \cdot 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 23290 \, \text{m}^{-1}.
   \]  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \approx 9.28 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{J}.
   \]

6. **Energy Difference for Vibrational Transition**:  
   The vibrational energy levels are \( E_{\text{vib}} = (n + \frac{1}{2}) h \nu \). For \( n = 0 \to n = 1 \):  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \nu = h \cdot \frac{w}{2 \pi}.
   \]  
   Given \( w = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \):  
   \[
   \nu = \frac{4 \times 10^{14}}{2 \pi} \approx 6.366 \times 10^{13} \, \text{Hz}.
   \]  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 6.366 \times 10^{13} \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
   \]

7. **Comparison of Energy Differences**:  
   - \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \approx 9.28 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{J} \)  
   - \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \)  

   The rotational transition requires less energy. However, the options provided do not match the calculated momentum for the rotational transition (\( p = \frac{\Delta E}{c} \approx 3.09 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns} \)).

8. **Photon Momentum for Vibrational Transition**:  
   Assuming the question refers to the vibrational transition:  
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.22 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
   \]  
   This matches **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The rotational transition requires less energy, but the provided options suggest the question focuses on the vibrational transition. Thus, the correct answer is based on the vibrational energy difference.
