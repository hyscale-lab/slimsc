Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about molecular symmetry. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3H symmetry. Hmm, I've heard about symmetry in molecules before, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think this through.

First, what's C3H symmetry? I remember that the "C" stands for "proper rotation," and the subscript number indicates the order of rotation. C3 means a 120-degree rotation. The "H" part probably refers to the presence of a horizontal mirror plane. So, a molecule with C3H symmetry would look the same after a 120-degree rotation around an axis and also have a horizontal mirror plane that divides the molecule into mirror images.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. That name sounds complex. Triphenylene... something with trifuran rings. I'm picturing maybe three phenyl groups attached to a central structure. The numbering might suggest some symmetry.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. So, a benzo ring fused with a trifuran system. The numbering here suggests that the substituents are arranged in a certain way. Benzo might give some symmetry.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. The structure is boron with three isopropyl groups attached. Isopropyl groups are (CH2)2CH- so each is a symmetrical substituent. Boron is in the center. Would this lead to C3H symmetry? Let's think. If all three substituents are the same and arranged symmetrically, maybe 120 degrees apart. So, when you rotate 120 degrees, it looks the same. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? That depends on the structure. If the molecule is flat, maybe a mirror plane exists in the plane of the boron and the isopropyl substituents. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a trigonal planar geometry, then perhaps a horizontal mirror plane exists. Wait, but for C3H, I think the H is a horizontal mirror plane, which would require that the molecule has a plane where it's symmetric when reflected over it. If the molecule is trigonal planar and all substituents are identical, maybe that's the case.

Option D: Quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic structure, a norbornane derivative. Its structure is two cyclohexane rings fused together. I remember that quinuclidine has a C3 axis. Let me visualize it: the molecule has three substituents arranged in a triangular fashion. Wait, no, quinuclidine is actually a bicyclic structure with a bridge, so it has a three-fold rotational axis. Does it have a mirror plane? Hmm, I'm not sure. Quinuclidine's structure is more about the bridge. I think it has a horizontal mirror plane because the molecule is symmetrical in that plane. So, if it has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then it would have C3H symmetry.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recap. C3H symmetry implies that the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (meaning a 120-degree rotation would superimpose the molecule onto itself) and a horizontal mirror plane (a mirror plane that cuts through the molecule in a horizontal direction, which is usually perpendicular to the rotation axis). So the molecule must look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also be symmetrical when reflected over the horizontal plane.

Now, let's think about each molecule.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. B has three identical isopropyl groups. Since they're all the same and arranged symmetrically, perhaps in a trigonal planar arrangement. So, if you rotate 120 degrees, it looks the same. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the boron is in the center and the substituents are pointing out, the mirror plane would have to pass through the boron and maybe one of the substituent groups, but I'm not sure if that's a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, perhaps a horizontal plane cutting through the boron and the middle of the isopropyl groups. Wait, isopropyl groups are symmetrical in themselves, so maybe the molecule as a whole has such symmetry.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the triisopropylborate has a three-fold rotation axis but lacks a horizontal mirror plane. Or maybe it has both. Hmm.

Option D: Quinuclidine. It's a bridged bicyclic compound. The structure has a bridge, and I think it's a tricyclic compound. Wait, no, quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure. So, the molecule has a bridge, and the substituents are arranged in a way that would allow rotation. I'm trying to visualize the symmetry. I think quinuclidine has a three-fold axis because the bridge creates a structure where three positions are equivalent. Also, it has a mirror plane. If you imagine cutting through the middle of the bridge, perhaps that's a horizontal mirror plane. So, it has both a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, making it C3H.

Wait, but I'm not 100% certain. Let's consider the others.

Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-… The name suggests three phenoxy groups attached to a central furan ring? Or perhaps a larger system with three fused rings. I'm not sure, but if the molecule is symmetrical with three substituents at 120 degrees apart, and perhaps a mirror plane, then it might have C3H. But I'm not certain.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran... So, a benzo ring fused to a trifuran. The numbering suggests that the substituents are at positions 1,3,4,6,7,9. Wait, without the actual structure, it's a bit hard, but perhaps in this case, the substituents are arranged symmetrically. Maybe a three-fold symmetry. But I'm not sure if it has the H part, the horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, maybe the triphenyleno compound (option A) has a more complex arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the key is to recognize the molecules that have both a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

I remember that triisopropyl borate has three identical substituents arranged in a trigonal planar fashion around the boron. So, when you rotate the molecule 120 degrees, it looks the same. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the molecule is symmetric across a plane that's horizontal to the boron, perhaps yes. For example, if the substituents are arranged in a trigonal planar geometry, then each is at 120 degrees, and there's a mirror plane that could pass through the boron and each substituent. Wait, but a mirror plane that's horizontal would have to be in a particular orientation. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has multiple planes, but the presence of a horizontal one is key.

Alternatively, quinuclidine's structure, being a bridged bicyclic compound, might have a horizontal mirror plane. For example, the bridge could be in a plane that's a mirror. So, if the bridge is along a certain axis, the mirror plane would cut through it, and the molecule would be symmetric.

So, which of these has both C3 and H?

I think triisopropyl borate (option C) has a C3 axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Let me think about the structure. The boron is at the center, with three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl group is symmetric. So, looking down the C3 axis (which goes through the boron and is perpendicular to the plane of the substituents), a 120-degree rotation would cycle the substituents. Now, for the mirror plane: if the mirror is perpendicular to the rotation axis, that's a vertical plane. But we're looking for a horizontal mirror plane, which would be in the plane of rotation. Wait, the rotation axis is probably perpendicular to the mirror plane. Hmm, wait, no. The horizontal mirror plane would be a plane that's perpendicular to the vertical axis. Let's say the rotation axis is vertical. Then the mirror plane could be horizontal, cutting through the molecule.

Wait, for example, if the molecule is lying flat on a table, the table would be the horizontal plane. So, if the boron is above the table, and the substituents are arranged in a trigonal planar fashion around it, then the plane of the table would be a mirror plane. But wait, the substituents are above the table. So no, that wouldn't be the case. Alternatively, if the rotation axis is horizontal, then a horizontal mirror plane would lie in the same plane as the rotation axis. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about each option's structure.

Triisopropyl borate: structure is B with three CH(CH2CH3)2 groups attached. So, trigonal planar geometry around B. The molecule is flat, with each isopropyl group attached symmetrically. So, any C3 rotation would cycle the substituents. Now, for a mirror plane. Since the molecule is flat and symmetrical, it might have multiple mirror planes. The horizontal mirror plane would be the plane that contains the boron and is perpendicular to the substituents. Or perhaps, if the molecule is in a plane, then the mirror plane is that same plane. So, in this case, the plane is both a mirror plane and the plane of the molecule, which would make it a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, but in reality, the mirror planes for a trigonal planar molecule would be in the plane of the molecule and through each substituent. No, wait, trigonal planar has three mirror planes, each bisecting one substituent. So, the molecule has three vertical mirror planes, not horizontal. So, if the molecule is sitting on a table, the table's surface is a horizontal plane. Triisopropyl borate would have a horizontal mirror plane if the molecule is symmetrical across that plane. But since the substituents are all above the boron, the mirror plane would have to be in the middle. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane but has three vertical ones. So, in that case, it would have C3 symmetry without the H, so just C3. But the question is about C3H.

Then, what about quinuclidine? Its structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, so it's a bridged compound. The structure has a three-membered bridge, and the molecule is symmetric. I think it has a three-fold rotation axis. Does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Imagine the bridge being the top, and the molecule having a plane that cuts through the bridge. That might be a horizontal plane. So, if you reflect across that plane, the molecule would look the same. So, quinuclidine would have both C3 and H, making it C3H.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option D, quinuclidine.

Wait, but another possibility: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-… I'm not sure, but perhaps that structure is a triphenylene ring fused with a trifuran. Triphenylene itself is a symmetric molecule with three benzene rings arranged in a symmetric way. Fused with a trifuran, it might have a three-fold axis and a mirror plane.

But I'm not as certain about that. So, perhaps the more likely candidates are options C and D.

Another approach: think about common molecules with C3H symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate is a known compound with trigonal symmetry. Wait, but I'm trying to remember if it has a horizontal mirror plane. Let me think of the structure. Boron is in the center, each isopropyl group is attached. If the molecule is in the plane of the paper, then the plane of the paper would be a horizontal mirror plane. But no, because the substituents are all attached to the boron, which is in the center. So, the mirror plane would need to pass through the boron and some substituents. Alternatively, perhaps each mirror plane is vertical relative to the molecule. So, in that case, the molecule might have C3 symmetry without the H.

Quinuclidine: I think it's a molecule that's been studied for its symmetry. I remember that quinuclidine has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, yes, C3H.

So, putting it together: the options given are A, B, C, D. The question is which has C3H symmetry.

So, the correct answer would be option D, quinuclidine. Or option C, triisopropyl borate.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again. Triisopropyl borate: does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

The boron is at the center, with three isopropyl groups arranged in a trigonal planar fashion. If I imagine the boron in the center, and each substituent pointing in different directions (say, 120 degrees apart), then the molecule is in a plane. So, the plane itself is a mirror plane, but is it horizontal?

Wait, in real terms, if the molecule is on a table, the table's surface is the horizontal plane. So, the mirror plane would have to be the table's surface. But the molecule's structure is flat, so the mirror plane would be the plane of the molecule, which is horizontal. So, perhaps triisopropyl borate does have a horizontal mirror plane, making it C3H.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical across a horizontal plane. So, if you take the mirror image, the substituents are identical. So, yes, it would have a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, but mirroring across a horizontal plane would invert the substituents into the same positions. So, for example, if the substituents are above the boron, the mirror plane would require that the mirror image is the same as the original, which would be if the substituents are arranged symmetrically.

Wait, but is that the case? Because each isopropyl group is identical. So, when you mirror the molecule across a horizontal plane, each substituent would map onto itself. So yes, the molecule would have a horizontal mirror plane.

So triisopropyl borate (option C) has both C3 and H symmetry, making it C3H.

But wait, then why would the question include quinuclidine as an option? Because I think I might be wrong about quinuclidine. Maybe quinuclidine doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, it might have a vertical one.

Wait, quinuclidine's structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. If you imagine the structure, it's two cyclohexane rings bridged by a single carbon. The molecule is not flat; it has a bridge that gives it a three-dimensional structure. So, when you look at it, perhaps it has a three-fold axis that goes through the bridge and the opposite carbon. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, the bridge is attached to two carbons above and below the plane. So, the mirror plane would have to pass through the bridge and perhaps the opposite side. Hmm, perhaps a horizontal mirror plane would bisect the molecule, making the top and bottom symmetric. So, if you mirror across that plane, the molecule looks the same. Hmm, that's possible.

So, perhaps both option C and D have C3H symmetry, but the question gives only one correct option.

Wait, but the options are given as four choices, each a different molecule. So, perhaps I need to reconsider.

Another approach: look for the presence of a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Triisopropyl borate: C3 and H? I'm leaning towards yes.

Quinuclidine: I'm less certain, but I think it's C3 only without the H. Or maybe it doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, looking up (but I can't, as I'm supposed to think this through), I think that triisopropyl borate does have a horizontal mirror plane. So, C3H.

Alternatively, I'm getting myself confused. Maybe the correct answer is option C, triisopropyl borate.

Wait, another angle: which of these molecules is planar? Triisopropyl borate is planar, so it has a plane of symmetry. If it's planar, then the plane itself is a horizontal mirror plane, and with C3 symmetry, it would have C3H.

But wait, is it planar? No, because the isopropyl groups are bulky and likely to be above the plane. Wait, but the molecule is trigonal planar, so the boron is in the center, with each substituent pointing in a plane. So the molecule is flat, making the plane a horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the mirror plane is not horizontal but vertical.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about each option's symmetry.

- Triisopropylborate: trigonal planar around B, so C3 symmetry. But for H (horizontal mirror), does the molecule have a plane that's horizontal? If the substituents are in a plane, then the plane is the mirror. So, yes, it has H as well. So C3H.

- Quinuclidine: I'm not sure, but perhaps it has a C3 axis but no horizontal mirror plane.

- The other options: I can't visualize, but perhaps they don't have C3H.

So, the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another way: which of these molecules is known to have C3H symmetry?

Triisopropyl borate is a common example of a molecule with C3H symmetry. Quinuclidine, I think, has a different symmetry, possibly C3 without H.

So, putting it all together, the answer is option C: triisopropyl borate.

To determine which molecule has **C3H symmetry**, we analyze the given options based on their structural features. **C3H symmetry** implies the presence of a three-fold rotation axis (120° rotation) and a horizontal mirror plane that divides the molecule into symmetrical halves.

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**  
   This molecule consists of a triphenylene fused with a trifuran system. While the triphenylene portion may introduce some symmetry, the overall structure does not clearly exhibit both a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Thus, it is unlikely to have **C3H symmetry**.

2. **Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**  
   This molecule features a benzo ring fused with a trifuran system. The substituents are arranged in a way that suggests some symmetry, but the structure does not clearly support both a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Therefore, it does not exhibit **C3H symmetry**.

3. **Option C: Triisopropyl borate**  
   The structure of triisopropyl borate consists of a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups in a trigonal planar arrangement. This arrangement provides a three-fold rotation axis (C3 symmetry). Additionally, the molecule is symmetric across a horizontal plane that contains the boron atom and the midpoints of the isopropyl groups, making it a horizontal mirror plane (H symmetry). Thus, triisopropyl borate exhibits **C3H symmetry**.

4. **Option D: Quinuclidine**  
   Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound with a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure. It has a three-fold rotation axis due to the symmetry of the fused rings. However, it lacks a horizontal mirror plane because the molecule is not symmetric across a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. Therefore, it does not exhibit **C3H symmetry**.

### Conclusion:
Among the given options, **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) is the only molecule that exhibits both a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (H), making it the correct answer.

**Answer: C**
