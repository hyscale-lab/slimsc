Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an operator Ay. The setup is that Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S has the matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, and then see which of the given statements is correct.

Hmm, I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found using the characteristic equation, which is det(Ay - λI) = 0. Let me write down the matrix Ay first.

Since Ay = c * S, and S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]], then Ay should be c times that. Let me calculate c. Oh, c is h/(4π), right. So:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Wait, actually, that's correct. So the matrix Ay is:

[ [0, -i*(h/(4π)) ],
  [i*(h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

Wait, no, wait. Actually, when you multiply a matrix by a scalar, each element is multiplied. So S's first row is 0 and -i, so Ay's first row is 0 and -i*(h/(4π)), and the second row is i*(h/(4π)) and 0.

So to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the equation det(Ay - λI) = 0.

Let's compute Ay - λI:

[ [ -λ, -i*(h/(4π)) ],
  [ i*(h/(4π)), -λ ] ]

The determinant of this matrix is ( (-λ)(-λ) ) - ( (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) )

So determinant = λ^2 - [ (-i)*(i) * (h/(4π))^2 ]

Wait, what's (-i)*(i)? Let's compute that. (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So the term becomes (1)*(h^2/(16π²)).

So det = λ^2 - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So λ² = h²/(16 π²) → λ = ± h/(4π) * (1/2) ? Wait, no, wait. Wait, solving λ² = (h/(4π))² * (something?).

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the determinant.

Ay - λI is:

[ [ -λ, -i*(h/(4π)) ],
  [ i*(h/(4π)), -λ ] ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - ( (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) )

So that's λ² - [ (-i)(i) * (h/(4π))² ]

Compute (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1.

So determinant is λ² - ( (h/(4π))² * 1 ) = 0 → λ² = (h/(4π))² → λ = ± h/(4π).

Ah, wait, that's different. So the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Wait no, wait—no, wait: Wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, the determinant is [ (-λ)(-λ) ) ] - [ ( -i*(h/4π) ) * ( i*(h/4π) ) ]

So the second term is ( -i * i ) * (h^2)/(16 π²) )

Wait, -i * i = -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the second term is (1) * (h²/(16 π²)).

So determinant is λ² - (h²/(16 π²)) ) = 0 → λ² = h²/(16 π²) → λ = ± h/(4π).

Wait, so the eigenvalues are +h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers here.

Wait, but the options given talk about imaginary parts. Let me look at the options.

Option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue is ±2πh and the real part ±h/(4π). But wait, the eigenvalues I found are real, so their imaginary parts are zero. So option A can't be correct.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2; real parts ±1. But my eigenvalues are h/(4π), which for h= Planck's constant is a real number, but without knowing the actual value, this doesn't match B either.

Wait, perhaps I missed something. Wait, the matrix S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]], and that's the structure of the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, the Pauli Y matrix is usually written as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the operator Ay is c multiplied by the Pauli Y matrix.

In quantum mechanics, the eigenvalues of the spin operator S are ± ħ/2. So, since Ay = c * S, and c is h/(4π), which is the same as ħ/(2), because h = 2π ħ. So h/(4π) = (2π ħ)/(4π)) = ħ/2.

So, S is the Pauli matrix, which for spin-1/2 systems, has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So Ay = c * S would have eigenvalues c*(± ħ/2) = (h/(4π)) * (± ħ/2 ). Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is (in terms of spin) S = (ħ/2) * σ_y, where σ_y is the Pauli Y matrix itself.

So, Ay = c * S = c * (ħ/2 σ_y ) = (h/(4π)) * (ħ/2 σ_y )

Wait, but wait, let me compute c. c = h/(4π). h is Planck's constant, which is 2π ħ. So substituting, c = (2π ħ)/(4π) )= ħ/(2).

So Ay = (ħ/2) * (ħ/2 σ_y )? Wait, no, wait. Wait, S is (ħ/2) σ_y. So Ay = c * S = (h/(4π)) * ( (ħ/2) σ_y )

But since h = 2π ħ, then h/(4π) = (2π ħ)/(4 π) )= ħ/(2). So Ay = ( ħ/2 ) * ( ( ħ/2 ) σ_y )? No, wait. Wait, no. Wait, S is the spin operator, which is (ħ/2) σ_y, so Ay is c * S. So Ay = c * ( ħ/2 σ_y )

But c is h/(4π). So substituting, Ay = (h/(4π)) * ( ħ/2 ) σ_y.

Wait, but h is 2π ħ, so h/(4 π) = (2π ħ)/(4 π) )= ħ/(2).

So Ay = ( ħ/(2) ) * ( ħ/(2) ) σ_y = ( ħ²/(4) ) σ_y.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think of it in terms of eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1, so the eigenvalues of Ay would be c multiplied by the eigenvalues of S.

Wait, S is (ħ/2) σ_y, so the eigenvalues of S are (ħ/2) * (±1) → ± ħ/2.

So Ay = c * S → its eigenvalues are c * (± ħ/2 ). But c is h/(4π) = ħ/(2), so c*(± ħ/2 ) = ( ħ/(2) )*(± ħ/2 ) = ± ħ²/(4).

But that doesn't seem right, because ħ²/(4) is a unit of action squared, which doesn't make sense for an angular momentum component. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should think more carefully. Since S is a spin operator, which is dimensionless in terms of matrix, but when multiplied by ħ/2, it's the actual spin angular momentum. So the eigenvalues of S are ± ħ/2.

So Ay = c * S → eigenvalues are c * (± ħ/2 )

Since c = h/(4π) = (2 π ħ)/(4 π) = ħ/(2).

So eigenvalues of Ay are ( ħ/(2) ) * (± ħ/2 ) → (± ħ² )/(4 ). But wait, this gives eigenvalues with units of (J s)^2, which doesn't make sense for angular momentum. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the definition. Let me recompute.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach the problem directly. The matrix Ay is given, so perhaps it's easier to compute its eigenvalues directly without involving any physical constants.

The matrix Ay is:

[ [0, -i c],
  [i c, 0 ] ]

Where c = h/(4π).

To find eigenvalues, compute determinant of (Ay - λ I) = 0:

[ [ -λ, -i c ],
  [ i c, -λ ] ]

Determinant: ( (-λ)(-λ) ) - ( (-i c)(i c) ) = λ^2 - ( (-i)(i) c² )

Now, (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1.

So determinant: λ^2 - c^2 = 0 → λ^2 = c^2 → λ = ± c.

So eigenvalues are ± c, where c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). These are real numbers, so their imaginary parts are zero.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: imaginary parts ±2πh or –2πh. Not possible, since the eigenvalues are real. So A is incorrect.

Option B: imaginary parts +1/2 or –1/2, real parts ±1. Also incorrect, as the eigenvalues are h/(4π), which is a real number but not 1 or 1/2 unless h is set to specific values.

Wait, but perhaps the question is considering a different scaling. Let me think about the matrix S. S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The eigenvalues of S are ±1, because S is a Pauli matrix which has eigenvalues ±1.

So if Ay = c * S, then the eigenvalues of Ay would be c * (±1). So if c = h/(4π), then eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). Which is what I found earlier.

So in the problem, the question is, during the calculation, which statement is correct?

Looking at the options:

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, the basis functions for a 2x2 matrix are the standard basis vectors, like [1,0] and [0,1]. But the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are not necessarily the standard basis vectors unless the matrix is diagonal.

In this case, the matrix Ay is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]], which is not diagonal. So its eigenvectors are not the standard basis vectors. Therefore, option D is incorrect.

Option C says the eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Wait, in quantum mechanics, for angular momentum components, if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, then it's not an eigenstate of Az, but it can be an eigenstate of A² because A² commutes with all components of A.

Wait, the operator A is the intrinsic angular momentum, right? So A^2 is the square of the angular momentum, whose eigenvalues are ħ(ħ+1) times something, but regardless, A^2 commutes with Ay. So any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az, which is correct.

Wait, but the option says "can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az". That is correct because [Ay, A²] =0, so they share eigenstates. But Ay and Az do not commute, so if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it cannot be an eigenstate of Az.

So in this case, option C is correct.

But let me check the other options.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Since Ay is 2x2, the basis functions would be the standard basis vectors. But eigenvectors of Ay are not necessarily the standard basis vectors. For example, let's compute the eigenvectors.

For λ = c, we have (Ay - c I) v = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

[ [-c, -i c ],
  [i c, -c ] ]

We can write the equations:

- c v1 - i c v2 = 0 → v1 = (-i) v2.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [ -i, 1 ]^T. Similarly, for λ = -c, eigenvectors are [ i, 1 ]^T.

So the eigenvectors are not the standard basis vectors, so option D is incorrect.

So the correct statement is option C. So during the calculation, the correct statement is that the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - \lambda I) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the matrix \( A_y - \lambda I \) becomes:

\[
A_y - \lambda I = \begin{bmatrix} -\lambda & -i c \\ i c & -\lambda \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The determinant is:

\[
\det(A_y - \lambda I) = \lambda^2 - (-i c)(i c) = \lambda^2 - c^2.
\]

Setting \( \det(A_y - \lambda I) = 0 \), we find:

\[
\lambda^2 = c^2 \implies \lambda = \pm c.
\]

Since \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). These are real numbers, so the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are zero.

### Step 2: Analysis of the Options
- **Option A**: Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)), and the imaginary parts are zero.

- **Option B**: Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which do not match the values given in this option.

- **Option C**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).

- **Option D**: Claims that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is incorrect because the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not the standard basis vectors (\( [1, 0]^T \) and \( [0, 1]^T \)). Instead, they are proportional to \( [-i, 1]^T \) and \( [i, 1]^T \), which are not the standard basis vectors.

### Conclusion
The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) and the operators \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \).
