Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's see. The question is about what decay channels are kinematically allowed for a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different fermion pairs.

First, I remember that in particle physics, a boson like this would decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, right? The interaction term given is L = -λ f ψ̄_f (y)(v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So the boson X is interacting with fermions, and the coupling is proportional to X. So the decay would involve X turning into a pair of fermions.

But the key thing here is kinematic allowance. That depends on conservation laws and energy. So for a decay to be possible, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion pair, because you need enough energy to create the particles.

Wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So I need to figure out which fermions have masses such that 2m_fermion ≤ 6 GeV. Because each decay product is a pair, so each fermion in the pair must be less than or equal to 3 GeV each.

Let me list the known fermion masses. Let's think: electrons, muons, taus, and quarks. But wait, quarks have different masses. Let me see:

Electron (e⁻): about 0.0005 GeV (negligible)
Muon (μ⁻): ~0.105 GeV
Tau (τ⁻): ~1.777 GeV
Up quark (u): around 2 MeV, so 0.002 GeV
Down quark (d): ~3-5 MeV, so 0.003-0.005 GeV
Charm (c): ~1.27 GeV
Strange (s): ~95-100 MeV, so ~0.095 GeV
Bottom (b): ~4.7 GeV
Top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV

Wait, but wait a second, the X is 6 GeV. So for each fermion, if 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV, then the decay is possible. So let's see each option:

Option A: includes b, s, u, d, tau, e. Let's check:

b: 4.7 GeV each. So 2*4.7=9.4 GeV. X is only 6 GeV. So 9.4 >6. So b would not be allowed. So option A can't be correct because b is there.

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

c: mass ~1.27 GeV. 2*1.27=2.54 <6. So allowed.
s: 0.095 GeV, 2*0.095=0.19 <6 → allowed.
u, d: even lighter, so allowed.
tau: 1.777 GeV each, 2*1.777≈3.554, which is less than 6. So allowed.
mu: 0.105 GeV, 2*0.105=0.21 <6 → allowed.
e: negligible, so 2e's mass is almost 0. Allowed.

So all the fermions in option B are allowed.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e.

Wait, t quark is 173 GeV. 2*173=346 GeV. X is 6 GeV, so way less. So t is not allowed. So option C is incorrect because it includes the top quark.

Option D: includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Again, b is 4.7 GeV each. 2*4.7=9.4 >6, so decay to b bbar is not allowed. So option D is incorrect.

So the only correct option is B. Because all the fermions in option B have masses such that 2m_f ≤6 GeV. Thus, X can decay into any of those pairs.

Wait, but I need to make sure. So the allowed decays are for fermion pairs where each fermion's mass is ≤3 GeV. So:

c: 1.27, so 2.54<6 → yes.
s: 0.095 → 0.19 <6 → yes.
u: 0.002 → yes.
d: 0.003 → yes.
tau: 1.777 → 3.554 <6 → yes.
mu: 0.105 → 0.21 <6 → yes.
e: negligible → yes.

But what about the tau? 2 * 1.777 is about 3.55 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau pair is allowed.

So yes, option B includes all allowable fermions. So the correct answer should be option B.

To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we analyze the interaction term 

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (v + X(y)) \psi_f(y),
\]

which indicates that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The kinematic allowance depends on the fermion masses, as the boson's mass must be at least twice the mass of the fermion pair (\( 2m_f \leq m_X \)).

### Fermion Masses:
- **Electron (\( e^- \))**: \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_e \approx 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Muon (\( \mu^- \))**: \( \sim 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Tau (\( \tau^- \))**: \( \sim 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.554 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Up quark (\( u \))**: \( \sim 0.002 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_u \approx 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Down quark (\( d \))**: \( \sim 0.003 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_d \approx 0.006 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Strange quark (\( s \))**: \( \sim 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_s \approx 0.19 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Charm quark (\( c \))**: \( \sim 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \approx 2.54 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Bottom quark (\( b \))**: \( \sim 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \approx 9.4 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 9.4 > 6 \)).
- **Top quark (\( t \))**: \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 346 > 6 \)).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \). All these fermions satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The only kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are listed in **Option B**.
