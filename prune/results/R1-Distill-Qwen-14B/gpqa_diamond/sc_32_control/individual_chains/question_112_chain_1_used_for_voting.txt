Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Let |alpha> be the state describing an electron. It's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator whose matrix representation has elements Aij. The Aij are hbar/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise. Also, I need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay. So first, maybe I should write down what I know. The state |alpha> is given in terms of spin-up and spin-down states. But wait, it's proportional to that combination. So the actual state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, multiplied by some normalization constant.

Wait, I should probably normalize the state first. Because probabilities depend on the squared magnitudes. Let's compute the normalization factor. The state is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are orthonormal. So the normalization is the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

So the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). Let's compute their magnitudes.

For (1+i), the magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. So magnitude is sqrt(2).

For (2-i), magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5. So magnitude is sqrt(5).

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(2 +5) because the state is proportional to the sum. 2+5=7, so 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the normalized |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, but the question says it's proportional, so I think that's correct. So the actual state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the next part is about another operator. The operator's matrix elements A_ij are hbar/2 if i≠j, and zero otherwise. Hmm. So for a 2x2 matrix, since the state is in spin space (two states), the operator matrix looks like this:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Because when i≠j, A_ij = hbar/2, and when i=j, it's zero.

Wait, wait, no wait. Let me think again. The matrix is for the operator. The operator is acting on the spin states, which are |up> and |down> as basis. So the matrix representation is 2x2.

So for i and j being 1 and 2 (indexes for |up> and |down>), then A_12 = A_21 = hbar/2, and A_11 = A_22 = 0.

So the matrix is:

[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

That's the operator. Now, I need to find the eigenstates of this operator because the question asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator.

Wait, right. Because when you measure an operator, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the state collapses into the corresponding eigenstate.

So the probabilities are the square of the amplitude of the eigenstates in the |alpha> state.

So first, I should find the eigenstates of A.

The operator A is a 2x2 matrix which is anti-diagonal with hbar/2 in the off-diagonal elements. Let me find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The eigenvalue equation is A |v> = λ |v>.

The matrix A is:

[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

The characteristic equation is det(A - λ I) = 0.

So determinant is ( -λ ) ( -λ ) - (hbar/2)^2 = λ² - (hbar²/4 ) =0.

So λ² = hbar²/4 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Now, the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

For λ = hbar/2:

(A - (hbar/2) I ) |v> =0.

Which gives:

[ -hbar/2   hbar/2 ] [v1]   =0
[ hbar/2  -hbar/2 ] [v2]

These equations are:

- (hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvector can be written as |v> = a [1; 1], where a is normalization factor.

Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2:

(A + (hbar/2) I ) |v> =0.

Which gives:

[ hbar/2   hbar/2 ] [v1]   =0
[ hbar/2  hbar/2 ] [v2]

Equation: (hbar/2)(v1 + v2) =0 → v1 = -v2.

So the eigenvector is [1; -1] (times a normalization factor).

So the normalized eigenvectors:

For λ= hbar/2: (1/sqrt(2)) [1; 1].

For λ= -hbar/2: (1/sqrt(2)) [1; -1].

So the eigenstates are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, yes. Because |up> and |down> are the basis vectors. So for |+>, it's (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So now, the state |alpha> is expressed in the original basis (|up> and |down>). But I need to express it in terms of the eigenstates of operator A (which are |+> and |->).

So I can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+> and |->.

Let me compute the coefficients.

Let me denote |alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->.

So, expressing in terms of |+> and |->.

Given |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Expressing |up> and |down> in terms of |+> and |->:

|up> = (|+> + |->)/sqrt(2)
|down> = (|+> - |->)/sqrt(2)

So substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i) (|+> + |->)/sqrt(2) + (2-i) (|+> - |->)/sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Let's factor out 1/sqrt(2) and 1/sqrt(7):

= [ (1+i)(|+> + |->) + (2-i)(|+> - |->) ] / [ sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) ]

Expanding the terms inside the numerator:

= [ (1+i + 2 -i) |+> + (1+i - (2-i)) |-> ] / sqrt(14)

Compute the coefficients:

For |+>:

(1+i) + (2 - i) = (1 +2) + (i -i)=3 + 0i → 3.

For |->:

(1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 -2 + i +i → (-1) + 2i.

So,

= [ 3 |+> + (-1 + 2i) |-> ] / sqrt(14)

So,

c_+ = 3 / sqrt(14)
c_- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)

Wait, let me verify:

Wait, when I expand (1+i)(|+> + |->) + (2-i)(|+> - |->), I get:

(1+i)(|+> ) + (1+i)|-> + (2-i)|+> - (2-i)|->

Grouping terms:

|+> [ (1+i) + (2-i) ] + |-> [ (1+i) - (2-i) ]

So,

(1+i + 2 - i) = 3 → 3 |+>

(1+i -2 +i) → ( (1-2) ) + (i +i ) → (-1) + 2i → (-1 + 2i) |->

So yes, correct.

So c_+ is 3/sqrt(14), and c_- is (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, but |alpha> is a normalized state. Let's confirm that |c_+|² + |c_-|² equals 1.

Compute |3/sqrt(14)|² = 9/14.

Compute |(-1 +2i)|²: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5. So 5 /14.

Total: 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1. Correct.

So the coefficients are correct.

Now, the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate are |c_+|² and |c_-|².

So |c_+|² is (3²)/14 =9/14 ≈0.642857.

|c_-|² is 5/14 ≈0.357142.

Wait, but let's compute 9/14 and 5/14 exactly.

9/14 is about 0.642857, and 5/14 is about 0.357142.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which is close. But let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7

Wait, the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.3571. So 0.64 and 0.36 are approximate. But let's see the options.

Looking at the other options:

Option D says 0.61 and 0.29. Those are 61/100 and 29/100. Hmm, but I have 9/14 ≈0.6428. So perhaps option A is the closest.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute 9/14 exactly.

9 ÷14 =0.64285714285... so approximately 0.6429. So the first part would be 0.64, 0.36.

But wait, option A says the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36. That's 0.64 and 0.36 sum to 1, correct.

But let me double-check. 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is 0.64 rounded to two decimal places. 5/14 is approximately 0.3571, which is 0.36 when rounded to two decimal places.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

But let me look at the options again.

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

Option D) 0.61, 0.29 and 2hbar / sqrt(7).

Wait, but what about the average value of the operator?

The average value is <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is the operator whose eigenstates are |+> and |->, the expectation value is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities of each.

Because |alpha> is a mixture of |+> and |->. So the expectation value is the sum of (eigenvalue * probability).

The eigenvalues are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

So probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

So <A> = (hbar/2)(9/14) + (-hbar/2)(5/14) = [9/14 -5/14 ] (hbar/2 )

Which is (4/14) hbar/2 = (2/7) hbar/2 = (2hbar)/(14) = hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

So looking at the options:

Option A says average is hbar/7.

Option D says 2hbar/sqrt(7).

Wait, so the average is hbar/7, which matches option A.

But let's double-check the calculation.

Another way to compute <A> is to compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Expressed in the |up>, |down> basis, |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Operator A in matrix form is:

[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

So A is:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

So <A> = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7)   (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Compute this:

Let me compute each part.

First, the matrix product A multiplied by |alpha> vector.

| A |alpha> = A * [ (1+i) ; (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7 )

= [ 0*(1+i) + (hbar/2)(2 -i) ] / sqrt(7)
  [ (hbar/2)(1+i) + 0*(2 -i) ] / sqrt(7)

= [ (hbar/2)(2 -i) ; (hbar/2)(1 +i) ] / sqrt(7 )

So:

= [ (2 -i) hbar/(2) ; (1 +i) hbar/(2) ] multiplied by 1/sqrt(7)

Now, take the conjugate transpose of |alpha> and multiply by A|alpha>.

<alpha| A |alpha> = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (2 -i) hbar/(2), (1 +i) hbar/(2) ]^T / sqrt(7)

Wait, no. Wait, let me correct that.

Wait, the first step was:

Compute A |alpha> = [ (hbar/2)(2 - i) ; (hbar/2)(1 + i) ] / sqrt(7 )

So each component is (hbar/2)(2 - i) / sqrt(7 ) and (hbar/2)(1 +i) / sqrt(7 )

Then, <alpha| is [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ]

So the inner product is:

(1 -i)/sqrt(7) * [ (hbar/2)(2 - i) / sqrt(7) ] + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * [ (hbar/2)(1 +i) / sqrt(7) ]

Factor out (hbar/2) / 7:

= (hbar/2) /7 [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ]

Compute each term separately.

First term: (1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) -i*2 + i^2 → 2 -i -2i -1 → (2-1) + (-3i) → 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) → 2*1 + 2*i +i*1 +i*i → 2 +2i +i +i^2 → 2 +3i -1 → (2-1) +3i → 1 +3i.

Adding the two terms: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2 +0i =2.

So the inner product is (hbar/2)/7 * 2 = (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

Which matches the earlier result. So <A> is hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Option D) 0.61, 0.29 and 2 hbar / sqrt(7) → but our average is hbar/7, so D is incorrect.

Let me check if I'm confident about the probabilities.

We found |c_+|² =9/14 ≈0.642857, which is approximately 0.64. |c_-|²=5/14≈0.3571, which is approximately 0.36.

So the probabilities match option A, and the average matches option A.

But wait, looking again at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7 → that's correct.

So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me double-check the eigenstates.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenstates. Because for the operator A, the eigenstates are |+> and |->, as I had earlier, but let me confirm.

Operator A is:

[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

Which is actually the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of Pauli X, which are |+> and |->. So yes, correct.

So the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+> and |-> is correct.

So I think the correct answer is option A: probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7.

To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The coefficients \( (1+i) \) and \( (2-i) \) have magnitudes \( \sqrt{2} \) and \( \sqrt{5} \), respectively. The normalization factor is \( 1/\sqrt{7} \), so the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \) with matrix elements \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. Its matrix representation is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), and the corresponding eigenstates are:

\[
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

We express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \). Substituting \( |\uparrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|+\rangle + |-\rangle) \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|+\rangle - |-\rangle) \), we find:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} |+\rangle + \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} |-\rangle.
\]

The coefficients are \( c_+ = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \) and \( c_- = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \). The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \) are:

\[
|c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

The average value of \( A \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \left( \frac{9}{14} \right) \frac{\hbar}{2} + \left( \frac{5}{14} \right) \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**A) 0.64, 0.36, and \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).**
