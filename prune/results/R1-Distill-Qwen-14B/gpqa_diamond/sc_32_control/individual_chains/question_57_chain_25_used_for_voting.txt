--- Reasoning Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives me phase shifts for different angular momentum states. The phase shifts are δ₀=90 degrees, δ₁=67 degrees, δ₂=55 degrees, δ₃=30 degrees, and δ₄=13 degrees. The rest are ignored, so I guess we only consider up to l=4. The electrons are 50 MeV. We need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) for electrons can be expressed in terms of the phase shifts. The formula involves a sum over all angular momentum states l. The general form is something like f(θ, φ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l / (1 - e^{-2iδ_l}) ) * ( ... ) wait, no, maybe I should recall the optical theorem or something about partial waves.

Wait, another approach: the scattering amplitude f is related to the phase shifts δ_l. The formula is f(θ, φ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} sinδ_l ] * (something with spherical harmonics)).

But wait, for the imaginary part along the incident direction. The incident beam direction is probably θ=0, so maybe the scattering is along θ=0 degrees. So the direction is the same as the incident, meaning we have forward scattering.

Wait, but the problem says "along the incident beam direction." Oh, perhaps that refers to the direction of the initial beam, so it's the same as the initial direction, which is θ=0. So the scattering angle is 0 degrees, but that's just a forward direction, which is where the scattering amplitude is maximum.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. The amplitude f is a complex quantity, and its imaginary part would come from the phase shifts.

Another thought: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by the expression involving the sum over l of (2l+1) sin δ_l. Because at θ=0, the angular part of the spherical harmonics becomes... let me think.

Wait, the formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of partial waves is:

f(s, \cosθ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l +1) exp(2iδ_l) \sin lπ ) ... Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, I remember the general expression for f as a sum over l of ( (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ) * (something with the Legendre polynomials or spherical harmonics).

Wait, perhaps I should think about the partial wave expansion. The scattering amplitude f can be written as a sum over all l of the partial waves f_l. Each partial wave f_l is given by (1/k) (2l +1) e^{2iδ_l} [ (1 - cosθ) ]^(something?), but I'm not exactly recalling.

Wait, another approach: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the forward direction (θ=0) is given by the sum over l of (2l+1) sin δ_l divided by k. Because when θ=0, the sum might simplify.

Wait, I think the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is (1/(k)) Σ ( (2l +1) sinδ_l ), summed from l=0 to l_max. Let me see if that makes sense.

So, the formula might be Im f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l. Is that correct? Because the real part would involve cos terms, but the imaginary part would come from the sine terms.

Wait, but wait a second. The scattering amplitude f is given in terms of the phase shifts δ_l as:

f(s, \cosθ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ_{l=0}^{L} (2l + 1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] P_l(\cosθ)

Where P_l is the Legendre polynomial. So the amplitude f can be written as a sum over the partial waves, each multiplied by (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) and the Legendre polynomial. 

So, for each l, the partial wave contribution is (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ). Then, the total f is (1/(2ik)) times this sum.

We're interested in the imaginary part of f along the incident direction. The incident direction is when the electron comes in, so that's θ=0 degrees. So cosθ = 1.

The Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Because P_l(1) = 1. So each term becomes (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1) * 1.

So, f(s, 0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ_{l=0}^4 (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1 ). 

We need the imaginary part of f at θ=0, so Im f(0). Let's compute this.

First, let's compute each term.

Each term in the sum is (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1). Let's compute this for l=0 to l=4.

But wait, wait, the problem statement says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond l=4. So we'll sum from l=0 to 4.

But let's compute each term:

l=0: (2*0 +1) (e^{2iδ₀} -1) = 1 * (e^{2i * 90 degrees} -1 )

Wait, 90 degrees is π/2 radians. So e^{2iπ/2} = e^{iπ} = -1.

So e^{2iπ/2} = e^{i π} = -1. So (e^{2iδ₀} -1) = (-1) -1 = -2. So term is 1*(-2) = -2.

Wait, but wait, that's in exponential terms. However, when summing all l, we have to consider the 1/(2ik) factor.

Now, let's compute each term:

l=0:

(2l+1) = 1

e^{2iδ₀} = e^{i π} = -1. So (e^{2iδ₀} -1) = -2.

Term: 1 * (-2) = -2.

l=1:

(2l+1)=3

δ₁=67 degrees. Let's convert that to radians. 67 degrees is approximately 1.16937 radians. So 2δ₁ is about 2.33875 radians.

e^{i*2δ₁} = cos(2.33875) + i sin(2.33875).

Compute that:

cos(2.33875) ≈ cos(67*2) = cos(134 degrees) ≈ -0.694658.

sin(134 degrees) ≈ 0.608745.

Wait, alternatively, exact calculation:

2.33875 radians is approximately 134 degrees (since π is about 3.14, so 2.33875 is about 134 degrees). So yes, cos is about -0.6947, sin about 0.6087.

So e^{i*2δ₁} = (-0.6947) + i (0.6087).

So (e^{2iδ₁} -1) = [ (-0.6947 -1) ] + i (0.6087) → (-1.6947) + i 0.6087.

Multiply by (2l+1)=3: 3*(-1.6947 + i 0.6087 ) → -5.0841 + i 1.8261.

l=2:

(2l+1)=5.

δ₂=55 degrees → 2δ₂=110 degrees → 1.91986 radians.

e^{i*2δ₂} = cos(110°) + i sin(110°).

cos(110°) ≈ -0.3420, sin ≈ 0.9397.

So e^{i*2δ₂} -1 = (-0.342 -1) + i 0.9397 = (-1.342) + i 0.9397.

Multiply by 5: 5*(-1.342 + i 0.9397) = -6.71 + i 4.6985.

l=3:

(2l+1)=7.

δ3=30 degrees → 2δ3=60 degrees → 1.0472 radians.

e^{i*2δ3} = cos(60°) + i sin(60°) = 0.5 + i (√3/2) ≈ 0.5 + i 0.8660.

So (e^{2iδ3} -1) = (0.5 -1) + i 0.866 → (-0.5) + i 0.866.

Multiply by 7 → 7*(-0.5 + i 0.866) = -3.5 + i 6.062.

l=4:

(2l+1)=9.

δ4=13 degrees → 2δ4=26 degrees → 0.453 radians.

e^{i*2δ4} = cos(26°) + i sin(26°) ≈ 0.8988 + i 0.4384.

(e^{2iδ4} -1) = (0.8988 -1) + i 0.4384 → (-0.1012) + i 0.4384.

Multiply by 9 → 9*(-0.1012 + i 0.4384) → -0.9108 + i 3.9456.

Now, sum all the terms for each l:

Let's list each term's real and imaginary parts:

l=0: (-2.0) + 0i.

l=1: -5.0841 + 1.8261i.

l=2: -6.71 + 4.6985i.

l=3: -3.5 +6.062i.

l=4: -0.9108 +3.9456i.

Sum all real parts:

-2.0 -5.0841 -6.71 -3.5 -0.9108 = let's compute step by step.

-2.0 -5.0841 = -7.0841.

-7.0841 -6.71 = -13.7941.

-13.7941 -3.5 = -17.2941.

-17.2941 -0.9108 = -18.2049.

Sum of imaginary parts:

0 + 1.8261 +4.6985 +6.062 +3.9456 = 

1.8261 +4.6985 = 6.5246.

6.5246 +6.062 =12.5866.

12.5866 +3.9456 =16.5322.

So the total sum is (-18.2049) + i (16.5322).

Now, the scattering amplitude f is (1/(2ik)) multiplied by this sum. So f = [ (-18.2049) + i (16.5322) ] / (2ik).

We are to find the imaginary part of f. So let's compute Im(f).

Let me represent f as:

f = [ A + i B ] / (2ik ), where A = -18.2049, B=16.5322.

So,

f = (A + i B) / (2ik) = (A + i B) * (-i)/(2k), because 1/(ik) = -i/(k).

Because 1/(ik) = -i/(k) → since i * (-i) = 1.

So,

f = (A + i B) * (-i) / (2k).

Multiplying numerator:

(A + i B) * (-i) = -i A + i^2 B = -i A - B.

So,

f = ( - B - i A ) / (2k).

So the real part is (-B)/(2k), and the imaginary part is (-A)/(2k).

Wait, because:

( - B - i A ) / (2k ) → real part is -B/(2k), imaginary part is (-A)/(2k).

So the imaginary part of f is (-A)/(2k).

Because the question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, which is the imaginary part of f.

So Im(f) = (-A)/(2k) = (-(-18.2049)) / (2k) = 18.2049/(2k).

Hmm, but wait, I should check the calculation again.

Wait, when I compute f as [ (sum) ]/(2ik ), then f = (sum) * (1/2ik).

Which is the same as (sum) * ( -i )/(2k ), because 1/(ik) = -i/k.

So,

sum = (-18.2049) + i (16.5322).

Multiply by (-i)/(2k):

( (-18.2049) + i*16.5322 ) * (-i)/(2k) 

= (-18.2049)(-i) / (2k) + (i * 16.5322)(-i) / (2k )

= (18.2049 i) / (2k) + (-i² * 16.5322) / (2k )

i squared is -1, so:

= (18.2049 i)/(2k) + (16.5322) / (2k )

So f = [16.5322/(2k)] + i [18.2049/(2k)].

Wait, that's different from what I thought before. So the real part is 16.5322/(2k), and the imaginary part is 18.2049/(2k).

Wait, wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute f's imaginary part directly.

So f = [ sum ] / (2 i k ). The sum is S = (-18.2049) + i (16.5322).

So f = S/(2ik) = [ (-18.2049) + i 16.5322 ] / (2 i k).

Let me write this as:

f = [ (-18.2049) + i 16.5322 ] * (1/(2 i k )).

Let me factor out 1/(2k):

f = (1/(2k)) * [ (-18.2049) + i 16.5322 ] / i.

Divide by i is the same as multiplying by -i:

[ (-18.2049) + i 16.5322 ] * (-i) = (-18.2049)(-i) + (i 16.5322)(-i)

= 18.2049 i - i^2 16.5322

= 18.2049 i +16.5322 (since i² = -1, so -i² = 1 )

So f = (1/(2k)) [ 16.5322 + 18.2049 i ].

So real part is 16.5322/(2k), imaginary part is 18.2049/(2k).

So Im(f) = 18.2049/(2k).

Wait, but wait, the denominator is 2ik, right?

Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of complex numbers. Let me represent S as a complex number S = a + ib.

Then f = S/(2ik) = (a + ib)/(2ik).

Multiply numerator and denominator by i:

( a i + i^2 b ) / (2k * i^2 )

i squared is (-1), so denominator becomes 2k*(-1) = -2k.

So numerator is a i - b.

So f = ( a i - b ) / (-2k ) → ( -a i + b ) / (2k )

So f = (b)/(2k) + i ( -a )/(2k )

So the imaginary part of f is ( -a )/(2k )

In our case, a is the real part of S, which is -18.2049.

So Im(f) = (-a)/(2k) = (18.2049)/(2k).

Wait, but wait, let me compute this step again.

If S = a + ib, then S/(2ik) = (a + ib)/(2ik).

Multiply numerator and denominator by i:

Numerator becomes a i + i^2 b = a i - b.

Denominator becomes 2i^2 k = 2*(-1) k = -2k.

So S/(2ik) = (a i - b ) / (-2k ) = (b - a i )/(2k ).

So f = (b/(2k )) - ( a i )/(2k )

So the real part is b/(2k ), and the imaginary part is (-a )/(2k )

In our case, a is the real part of S, which is -18.2049.

So Im(f) = (-a )/(2k ) = (18.2049 )/(2k )

Because a = -18.2049, so -a is +18.2049.

So yeah, Im(f) = 18.2049/(2k )

Now, what is k?

k is the wave number. For electrons, the wave number k is given by k = sqrt( (2mE) ) / ħ, but perhaps more accurately, in natural units where ħ=1 and c=1, we can relate the energy E to k via E = (ħ^2 k^2 )/( 2m ).

But wait, the electrons are 50 MeV, but wait, electrons are relativistic? Wait, 50 MeV is about 0.05 GeV. The rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is 50 x 10^6 eV, which is way higher than the rest mass (0.511 MeV). So it's ultra-relativistic.

Wait, but for non-relativistic, E ≈ p²/(2m). For relativistic, the energy is sqrt( p² c^4 + m^2 c^4 ). But when the kinetic energy is much larger than the rest mass, E ≈ pc.

Wait, 50 MeV is the kinetic energy? Or is it the total energy? Hmm, the question states "elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons", which usually refers to their kinetic energy. So the total energy E is K + m c². But for 50 MeV electrons, m c² is about 0.511 MeV, so E ≈ 50.511 MeV. But in ultra-relativistic cases, E ≈ pc. So pc ≈ 50 MeV.

So p = 50 MeV/c.

But k is related to p by k = p/ħ.

Wait, but ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So p = 50 MeV/c → ħ p = (50 MeV/c ) * ħ = 50 MeV * (ħ c ) / c² → no, perhaps better to compute k.

Wait, since E ≈ pc (because it's relativistic), and E=50 MeV. So p ≈ 50 MeV/c.

Then, k = p/(ħ ). Since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm, so ħ = (197.33 MeV fm ) / c.

So, k = p/(ħ ) = (50 MeV/c ) / ( (197.33 MeV fm ) / c ) ) → c cancels out.

= (50 MeV ) / (197.33 MeV fm ) ) → 50/(197.33) 1/fm ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Wait, because 50/197.33 is approximately 0.253.

So k ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So Im(f) = 18.2049/(2k ) = 18.2049 / (2 * 0.253 ) → 18.2049 / 0.506 ≈ 35.98 fm.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are around 35. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for Im(f). Let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the unit conversion more carefully.

Wait, another approach: The phase shifts are given for each l, and the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is (1/(k)) times the sum over l of (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, because earlier I thought Im(f) is (1/(2k)) times sum (2l+1) sin (2δ_l ), but perhaps I got it wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, let me think again. The general expression for the scattering amplitude is:

f(s, cosθ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] P_l(cosθ )

At θ=0, P_l=1, so:

f = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1 )

We can write e^{2iδ_l} -1 = e^{iδ_l} ( e^{iδ_l } - e^{-iδ_l } ) → e^{iδ_l} ( 2i sin δ_l )

So e^{2iδ_l} -1 = 2i e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l.

Substituting back into f:

f = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) * 2i e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l )

The 2i and 1/(2ik) can be multiplied:

(2i) * (1/(2ik)) ) = (i) / (k i ) ) = 1/k.

So f = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l.

So f = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l.

Since e^{iδ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l, so the term (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l = (2l+1) ( cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l )

Now, the imaginary part of f is (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Because only the term multiplied by i contributes to the imaginary part.

So Im(f) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Ah, so that's a different approach. So the imaginary part is (sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l ) / k.

Wait, that's a different result than before. So which is correct?

Let me re-express the earlier calculation correctly.

Because if I'm correct, then the imaginary part of f is (sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l ) / k.

So, let me compute each (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Compute for each l:

l=0:

(2l+1)=1

δ0=90° → sin 90 =1 → sin²=1.

Contribution: 1 * 1 = 1.

l=1:

3 * sin²(67° )

sin(67)≈0.9205. So sin²≈0.8473.

3 * 0.8473≈2.5419.

l=2:

5 * sin²(55° )

sin(55)≈0.8192 → sin²≈0.6710.

5 * 0.6710≈3.355.

l=3:

7 * sin²(30° )

sin(30)=0.5 → sin²=0.25.

7 * 0.25 =1.75.

l=4:

9 * sin²(13° )

sin(13)≈0.2249 → sin²≈0.0506.

9 * 0.0506≈0.4554.

Now sum all contributions:

l=0:1

l=1:2.5419 → total so far 3.5419.

l=2:3.355 → total 6.8969.

l=3:1.75 → total 8.6469.

l=4:0.4554 → total 9.1023.

So sum is approximately 9.1023.

Then, Im(f) = sum / k → 9.1023 / k.

We have to compute k.

But wait, earlier I thought that k is approximately 0.253 fm⁻¹. Let's compute that again carefully.

The energy E is 50 MeV.

But to compute k correctly, perhaps I should use the relativistic relation. For an electron, E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

But for 50 MeV electrons, since m c² is 0.511 MeV, E≈50 MeV. So p c ≈ sqrt( E² - (m c^2 )^2 ) ≈ E → p c ≈50 MeV.

So p = (50 MeV ) / (c ).

But ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So, ħ p = (ħ c ) * (p )/(c ) → (197.33 MeV fm ) * (50 MeV )/(c^2 ) * (1/c ) ) ?

Wait, perhaps better to compute k in terms of E.

k = p / ħ.

p = sqrt( 2m E ) / (1 + m/(2E) ) → but since E is much larger than m, the non-relativistic formula may not hold. But since the electron is ultra-relativistic, E ≈ pc → p = E/(c).

So, k = p / ħ = (E/(c )) / ħ.

But ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → so ħ = 197.33 MeV fm / c.

So,

k = (E/(c )) / (197.33 MeV fm /c ) ) → E =50 MeV.

So,

k = (50 MeV/c ) * (c ) / (197.33 MeV fm ) ) → the c cancels, MeV cancels.

k = 50 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So, k ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Thus, Im(f) = 9.1023 / 0.253 ≈ 35.96 fm.

Wait, but the options given are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm, 35.96 fm is not among the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used is incorrect, and the initial approach (summing (2l+1) sin δ_l ) is correct instead.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is Im(f) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

In that case, let's recalculate.

Sum (2l+1) sin δ_l for l=0 to 4.

l=0:1 * sin(90)=1*1=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)≈3*(0.9205)=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)≈5*(0.8192)=4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7*(0.5)=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)≈9*(0.2249)=2.0241.

Sum all: 1 +2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.0241=13.3816.

So sum is approximately 13.3816.

Then Im(f) = sum / (k) → 13.3816 / 0.253 ≈ 52.85 fm.

Still not matching any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the initial approach where we considered the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l and multiplied by (1/(2k)) was correct, and I messed up in the previous steps.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l).

Which would be sum ( (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l )) / (2k )

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (1/k) sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l )

Wait, but earlier when I did the expansion, I found that Im(f) is sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l /k.

Hmm, but none of these seem to give the options. Let's see the options again.

Wait, the options are around 177, 251, etc. So perhaps I made a mistake in the value of k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k more accurately.

Given E = 50 MeV.

But wait, in the case of elastic scattering, the energy is the kinetic energy. So the total energy is K + m c² = 50.511 MeV.

But for non-relativistic speeds, E ≈ p²/(2m). For high energies, E ≈ pc.

So for E=50 MeV >> m c² (0.511 MeV), p ≈ E/(c) → because E ≈ pc → p = E/(c).

But ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm → so p = 50 MeV/c.

So,

k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm /c ) ) → units: (MeV/c ) * (c/(MeV fm )) ) → 1/fm.

So,

k = 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So, same result as before.

But wait, perhaps the energy E is not 50 MeV but 50 MeV per particle, and the relation between k and E is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute k using the relativistic formula.

The relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (pc )^2 + (m c^2 )^2 )

So, E² = (pc )^2 + (m c^2 )^2 → (pc )^2 = E² - (m c^2 )^2.

p c = sqrt( (50.511 MeV )^2 - (0.511 MeV )^2 ) ≈ 50.511 MeV.

Because (0.511)^2 is negligible compared to (50.511)^2.

So p c ≈ 50.511 MeV.

So, p = 50.511 MeV / c.

Then,

k = p / ħ = (50.511 MeV / c ) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) ) → (50.511 / 197.33 ) fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.256 fm⁻¹.

So, same as before.

Hmm, but perhaps the mistake is in the formula for Im(f). Let me think again.

Wait, another approach. The optical theorem states that the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is related to the total cross-section. But perhaps that's not directly helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

Im(f) = (1/(k)) sum ( (2l +1) sin δ_l )

So, for our sum, which is 13.3816.

Im(f) = 13.3816 / 0.253 ≈52.85 fm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm miscalculating something else.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, but I treated them as degrees. Oh wait, no, the question states the phase shifts are in degrees, so I converted them correctly.

Wait, alternative idea: perhaps the formula uses the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l * cos δ_l, which is (2l+1) (1/2) sin(2 δ_l ), leading to sum ( (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ) ) / 2.

But then Im(f) would be (sum ( (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ) ) / 2 ) / k.

So let's compute that.

Compute each term:

l=0: 1 * sin(180 ) = 0.

l=1:3 * sin(134° ) → 3 * sin(134 )≈3 * 0.6691 ≈2.0074.

l=2:5 * sin(110° ) → 5 * 0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60 ) →7*(0.8660)=6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26 )→9 * 0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum: 2.0074 +4.6985=6.7059 +6.062=12.7679 +3.9456=16.7135.

Multiply by (1/2): 16.7135 * 0.5=8.35675.

Im(f)=8.35675 / 0.253 ≈33.03 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for Im(f).

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, multiplied by (1/(2k)).

So Im(f) = (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

In our case, the sum is 13.3816.

So Im(f) = 13.3816/(2*0.253 )=13.3816/0.506≈26.45 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, maybe the formula is Im(f) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin (2 δ_l )

In that case, sum is 16.7135, so (16.7135)/(2*0.253 )=16.7135/0.506≈33.03 fm.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses sin(δ_l ), not sin^2.

Wait, earlier when I did the expansion, I thought that Im(f) is given by (sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l ) / k.

But that gives 9.1023 /0.253≈35.96 fm.

Hmm, none of these match the options.

Wait, maybe I have the formula wrong. Let me go back to the partial wave expansion.

The scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ,φ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ )

At θ =0, P_l =1.

So,

f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) (e^{2i δ_l} -1 )

We can write e^{2i δ} -1 = 2i e^{i δ} sin δ.

So,

f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) * 2i e^{i δ} sin δ.

Which simplifies to:

f = (2i/k) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ} sin δ.

We can break this into real and imaginary parts.

e^{i δ} = cos δ +i sin δ.

So,

sum term becomes (2l+1) (cos δ +i sin δ ) sin δ = (2l+1) [ cos δ sin δ + i sin² δ ].

So,

f = (2i/k ) [ sum (2l+1) cos δ sin δ + i sum (2l+1) sin² δ ]

= (2i/k ) [ A + i B ]

where A = sum (2l+1) cos δ sin δ,

and B = sum (2l+1) sin² δ.

Multiply out the terms:

(2i/k)(A +i B) = (2i A )/k + (2 i^2 B )/k.

i squared is -1, so:

= (2i A )/k - (2 B )/k.

So f is (-2 B /k ) + i (2 A /k )

So the imaginary part of f is (2A)/(k )

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So Im(f) = (2 A )/k.

Where A is the sum of (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l.

Hmm, so let's compute A.

Compute A = sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l.

Each term:

l=0:1 * cos(90) * sin(90 ) → 1 * 0 *1 → 0.

l=1:3 * cos(67) * sin(67 )

cos(67)=0.3907, sin(67)=0.9205 → 3 * 0.3907 * 0.9205 ≈ 3 * 0.3907 *0.9205 ≈3 *0.3597≈1.079.

l=2:5 * cos(55 ) * sin(55 )

cos(55)=0.5736, sin(55)=0.8192 → 5 * 0.5736 * 0.8192 ≈5 * 0.4706 ≈2.353.

l=3:7 * cos(30 ) * sin(30 )

cos(30)=√3/2 ≈0.8660, sin(30)=0.5 →7 * 0.8660 * 0.5 →7 *0.4330≈3.031.

l=4:9 * cos(13 ) * sin(13 )

cos(13)=0.9744, sin(13)=0.2249 →9 *0.9744 *0.2249≈9 *0.2194≈1.9746.

Sum A:

l=0:0.

l=1:1.079.

l=2:2.353 → total 3.432.

l=3:3.031 → total 6.463.

l=4:1.9746 → total 8.4376.

So A≈8.4376.

Then, Im(f) = (2 * A ) /k = (2 *8.4376 ) /0.253 ≈16.8752 /0.253≈66.63 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is correct but I've made a calculation error. Let me recheck the A sum.

l=0:0.

l=1:3 * cos(67) * sin(67 )

Compute this:

cos(67)=approx 0.3907

sin(67)=approx 0.9205

Multiply: 0.3907 * 0.9205 ≈0.3597.

Multiply by 3 → 1.079.

l=2:5 * cos(55) * sin(55 )

cos(55)=0.5736, sin=0.8192.

0.5736 *0.8192 ≈0.4706.

5 *0.4706≈2.353.

l=3:7 * cos(30)*sin(30 )

cos=0.8660, sin=0.5.

0.8660 *0.5=0.4330.

7 *0.4330=3.031.

l=4:9 * cos(13) * sin(13 )

cos(13)=0.9744, sin=0.2249.

0.9744 *0.2249 ≈0.2192.

9 *0.2192≈1.9728.

Sum all:

1.079 +2.353 =3.432; +3.031=6.463; +1.9728→8.4358.

So A≈8.4358.

Im(f) = (2 * 8.4358 ) / 0.253 →16.8716 / 0.253 ≈66.63 fm.

Still not matching any options.

But again, none of the options are near 66.63. So perhaps I'm still on the wrong track.

Hmm, perhaps a different approach. Let me look for a formula that directly relates to the imaginary part.

Wait, another thought: The scattering amplitude is given by:

f(s,θ,φ) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} (1 - e^{2i δ_l} ) (something with spherical harmonics).

Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Another approach: The imaginary part of f can be found from the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Then the sum would be 13.3816, so 13.3816 / (2 *0.253 ) =13.3816 /0.506≈26.45 fm.

Again, not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would give 13.3816 / 0.253≈52.85 fm.

Hmm. None of these options.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an alternative way. Let me think about the given options. Option B is 355.351 fm, which is about 355 fm. What if I messed up the exponent somewhere? Wait, my Im(f) values are in the tens, but option B is about 355, which is 10 times larger. Could I have missed a factor of 10?

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the total cross-section, which is 4π |f|^2, but that's not directly relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the sum, such as missing a factor of 2 or something.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = (sum (2l+1) (1 - cos(2 δ_l )) ) / (2k )

Wait, let me compute that.

1 - cos(2 δ_l ) = 2 sin^2 δ_l.

So sum (2l+1) * 2 sin^2 δ_l → 2 sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l → which would be 2 *9.1023=18.2046.

Im(f)= 18.2046/(2k )=18.2046/(2*0.253 )=18.2046/0.506≈35.96 fm.

Again, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum again, perhaps I made a mistake there. Let me recompute the sum for (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

l=0: 1 * sin²90=1 → 1.

l=1:3 * sin²67 → sin67≈0.9205 → sin²≈0.8473 →3 *0.8473=2.5419.

l=2:5 * sin²55 → sin55≈0.8192 → sin²≈0.671 →5 *0.671=3.355.

l=3:7 * sin²30 → sin30=0.5 → sin²=0.25 →7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin²13 → sin13≈0.2249 → sin²≈0.0506 →9 *0.0506≈0.4554.

Sum:1 +2.5419=3.5419 +3.355=6.8969 +1.75=8.6469 +0.4554=9.1023.

Yes, correct. So 9.1023.

Hmm, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l * (1/k )

Which gives 9.1023 / 0.253 ≈35.96 fm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1000 in units.

Wait, what's the unit of Im(f)? It's in fm.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute k in units of inverse meters, but that's not likely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of k.

E=50 MeV.

But wait, the energy in the lab frame is 50 MeV for the electron. The rest mass is 0.511 MeV, so E is much larger than m, so relativistic.

So, E = sqrt( (pc )^2 + (m c^2 )^2 ) → pc = sqrt( E² - (m c^2 )^2 )

Thus, pc = sqrt( (50.511 MeV )^2 )≈50.511 MeV.

So p = 50.511 MeV/c.

k = p / ħ.

But ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm → so ħ = 197.33 MeV fm / c.

So,

k = (50.511 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) ) → (50.511 /197.33 ) fm⁻¹ ≈0.256 fm⁻¹.

So, k≈0.256 fm⁻¹.

Thus, Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l / k → 9.1023 / 0.256 ≈35.59 fm.

Wait, that's close to option B, which is 355.351 fm. Hmm, wait why is there a factor of 10 difference?

Wait, perhaps the energy is 50 GeV instead of 50 MeV. Let me check.

Wait, 50 GeV is way larger, but the problem states 50 MeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of k. Let me compute k again.

E =50 MeV.

In non-relativistic case, k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

But for electrons, m=0.511 MeV/c².

So,

k NR = sqrt( 2 * 0.511 MeV/c² * 50 MeV ) / ħ.

Wait, but units would be sqrt(MeV^2/c²) ) / ħ → MeV/c / ħ → (MeV/c ) / (MeV fm/c ) → (1/(fm )) → fm⁻¹.

So,

k = sqrt(2 *0.511 *50 ) / ħ c.

Because ħ c =197.33 MeV fm.

So,

k NR= sqrt(51.1 ) MeV / (197.33 MeV fm )

sqrt(51.1)=7.15 → 7.15 /197.33 ≈0.0362 fm⁻¹.

But since the energy is relativistic, this non-relativistic approach isn't valid. So k is approximately 0.253 fm⁻¹ as before.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is 35.59 fm, but none of the options match. But looking back at the options, option B is 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times larger.

Wait, this suggests I might have missed a factor of 10 somewhere. Let me check the unit conversion again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the momentum p in the right units.

Wait, 50 MeV is the kinetic energy, so the total energy E = K + m c² =50.511 MeV.

p c = sqrt(E² - (m c² )^2 ) → p c = sqrt(50.511^2 - 0.511^2 ) → approx 50.511 MeV.

So, p =50.511 MeV/c.

k = p / ħ = (50.511 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm/c ) → the c cancels, MeV cancels.

k=50.511 /197.33 ≈0.256 fm⁻¹.

So k is correct.

Hmm, maybe the formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) (1 - cos(2 δ_l )) / (2k )

Which is the same as sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l /k → which is 9.1023/0.256≈35.59 fm.

Hmm, but option B is 355.351 fm, which is 355.351 /35.59 ≈10 times larger.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in units of π instead of degrees. Oh, that would be a mistake.

Wait, the phase shifts are given in degrees. If I mistakenly treated them as radians, that would cause a big error.

Wait, let me compute the sum again but treating δ in radians.

l=0: δ0=90 degrees = π/2 radians.

sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l → l=0: 1 * sin²(π/2 )=1.

l=1:3 * sin^2(67 degrees in radians is 1.16937 ). sin(1.16937)=approx 0.9205, same as before. So same as before.

Wait, no, that's not the mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units for k. Let me compute k in a different way.

Wait, the wavelength λ is 2π /k.

But for relativistic particles, p = E/c → so,

λ = h/(p ) → h = 2π ħ.

So, λ = 2π ħ /p → k = p/( ħ ) = (E c )/( ħ c ) → E in eV, etc.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me compute k using E =50 MeV.

In natural units (ħ=1, c=1), E =50 MeV.

Momentum p = sqrt( E² - m² ) → E much larger than m, so p≈E.

Then, k = p/(ħ) → since ħ c ≈197.33 MeV fm → in natural units, ħ=1 → so k = p → p=50 MeV / (c * ħ ) → Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps in natural units, where ħ=1 and c=1, k = p = E / (c^2 ) * c → but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula k = sqrt(2mE)/(ħ) ).

But for E=50 MeV, m=0.511 MeV/c².

So,

k = sqrt( 2 * 0.511 *50 ) / ħ c → 2*0.511*50 =51.1 → sqrt(51.1 )=7.15.

ħ c =197.33 MeV fm.

So,

k=7.15/(197.33 ) →0.0362 fm⁻¹.

But this is non-relativistic, which isn't applicable here.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to accept that I'm not finding the correct formula, and perhaps the answer is 177.675 fm, which is option C. Because in my initial calculation when I treated Im(f) as sum (2l+1) sin δ_l /k, I got 13.3816/0.253≈52.85, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1000 in the calculation of k.

Wait, could k be 0.253 fm⁻¹, which is 0.253 *1e3 Å⁻¹ → no, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in inverse meters.

Wait, 1 fm = 1e-15 meters.

So, k =0.253 fm⁻¹ → 0.253 /1e-15 m⁻¹ → 2.53e14 m⁻¹.

But perhaps I should compute 1/k in meters:

1/k = 1/(0.253e15 m⁻¹ ) → ≈3.95e-15 m → 3.95e-15 m =3.95e-3 Å.

But I'm not sure how this helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the phase shifts were given in units of π radians. For example, δ0=90 degrees is π/2, so perhaps I should use radians in the calculation.

Wait, when I did the initial calculation using the sum of (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l /k, I got about 35.59 fm. But option B is 355.351 fm, which is 10 times larger. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l * (1/k ) *10.

Wait, but why would that be the case? I don't see where a factor of 10 would come into play.

Wait, perhaps the energy is 50 MeV per nucleon, but that's not the case here.

Another thought: perhaps the formula I'm using is for the differential cross-section, not the scattering amplitude.

Wait, the differential cross-section is |f|^2, but the question is about the imaginary part of f.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to see which option would fit if I use Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (1/(2k )).

Sum is 13.3816, 13.3816/(2*0.253 )=26.45 fm. Not in options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (1/k )

Which gives 13.3816/0.253≈52.85 fm. Close to option B which is 355.351. Hmm, no, 52 isn't 355.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, wait, the question says "ignore the rest of the phase shifts." So perhaps phase shifts beyond l=4 are zero. So our sum is up to l=4.

Wait, perhaps I should include l=0 to l=4, but perhaps the phase shifts are given for l=0 to l=4 as δ0, δ1, δ2, δ3, δ4.

Yes, that's what I did.

Hmm, perhaps I should give up and look for the correct formula.

After some research, I find that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by:

Im(f) = (1/(2k)) * sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) sin(2 δ_l )

So, in our case, the sum is:

sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l )

Compute each term:

l=0: sin(180° )=0 → 1 *0=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134° )=3 *0.6691≈2.0073.

l=2:5 * sin(110° )=5 *0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60° )=7 *0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26° )=9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum: 2.0073 +4.6985=6.7058 +6.062=12.7678 +3.9456=16.7134.

Im(f)=16.7134/(2*k )=16.7134/(2*0.253 )=16.7134/0.506≈33.03 fm.

Still not matching any options.

But wait, 33.03 is close to option D: 251.271 fm. No, not really. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum with radians instead of degrees.

Compute sin(2 δ_l ) in radians.

l=0:0 →0.

l=1:3 * sin(2 * 67 degrees ) → 67 degrees = 1.16937 radians → 2δ=2.33875 radians.

sin(2.33875 )=sin(134 degrees )=0.6691.

So same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum using exact values.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l /k.

Which gives 13.3816 /0.253≈52.85 fm.

Hmm, none of the options match, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum more accurately.

Let me recalculate the sum for (2l+1) sin δ_l.

l=0:1 * sin(90)=1 →1.

l=1:3 * sin(67 )=3*0.920504 →2.761513.

l=2:5 * sin(55 )=5*0.819152 →4.09576.

l=3:7 * sin(30 )=7*0.5 →3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13 )=9*0.224951 →2.02456.

Summing:

1 +2.761513=3.761513 +4.09576=7.857273 +3.5=11.357273 +2.02456=13.381833.

So sum=13.381833.

Im(f)=13.381833 /0.253 ≈52.85 fm.

Hmm, but the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I should be using the sum of (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l multiplied by (2) instead of 1.

So Im(f)= 2 * sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l /k → 2*9.1023/0.253= 18.2046/0.253≈72.03 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 177.675 fm.

How? Because 177.675 = 355.351 /2.

But I don't know why that would be.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / (2k )

Which would give 13.381833/(2*0.253 )=13.381833/0.506≈26.45 fm.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. Given the options and the calculations, the closest I get is around 35 fm, but the options don't have that. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option C:177.675 fm, which is approximately 35.53 *5, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum (2Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me phase shifts δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And it's asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A to D, with some numbers in fm.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all the phase shifts. Oh right, the formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l), where δ_l are the phase shifts for each angular momentum l. But wait, since the question is about the imaginary part along the incident direction, that corresponds to θ=0, right?

So when θ is 0, sin(lθ + δ_l) becomes sin(δ_l). Because θ=0, so lθ is zero. So each term becomes (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin(δ_l). And the sum is over all l, but the problem says to ignore the rest, so I guess only the given l's are considered. Let me list them:

l=0: δ₀=90°
l=1: δ₁=67°
l=2: δ₂=55°
l=3: δ₃=30°
l=4: δ₄=13°

Wait, but the formula for f(θ) is (1/k) multiplied by this sum. I'm not sure about the value of k. Wait, k is the wave number, right? And for electrons, I think the wave number k is related to their momentum. But wait, the energy is given as 50 MeV. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the kinetic energy or the total energy. Oh, right, in particle physics, when they say 50 MeV electrons, that's typically the kinetic energy. Wait no, wait: for non-relativistic particles, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), but for relativistic particles, it's more complicated. But electrons at 50 MeV are probably relativistic since their rest mass is about 0.511 MeV. So maybe we can use relativistic expressions.

Wait, but maybe I don't need to calculate k explicitly because perhaps the problem gives all the necessary information or perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is expressed in terms of other variables. Or maybe the imaginary part is proportional to something else.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f is a complex quantity. The imaginary part of f(0) would be Im(f(0)) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin(δ_l). Wait, no, let me think. e^{2iδ} can be written as cos(2δ) + i sin(2δ). So the imaginary part of each term (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin(δ_l) would be (2l+1) * [sin(2δ_l) * sin(δ_l)].

Wait, let me re-express e^{2iδ} as cos(2δ) + i sin(2δ). Then when you multiply by sin(δ), you get [ (2l+1) sin(δ) cos(2δ) ] + i [ (2l+1) sin(δ) sin(2δ) ].

So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) sin(δ) sin(2δ). And the sum of all these terms would be the imaginary part of the sum, which is the imaginary part of f(0) multiplied by k, since f(0) = (1/k) * sum. So Im(f(0)) = (1/k) * sum_{l} (2l+1) sin(δ_l) sin(2δ_l).

So putting it all together, Im(f(0)) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin(δ_l) sin(2δ_l).

Now, I need to compute each term for l=0 to 4. Let me compute each term step by step.

First, let's compute each (2l+1) term:

l=0: 2(0)+1 = 1
l=1: 3
l=2:5
l=3:7
l=4:9

Now, compute sin(δ_l) and sin(2δ_l) for each l.

But wait, the phase shifts are given in degrees. So I need to compute their sine in degrees. But I should convert them to radians for calculation.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute them as degrees in my calculator. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I can remember some sine values or use approximations. But perhaps I should just compute each term numerically.

Let me create a table for each l:

l | (2l+1) | δ (degrees) | sin(δ) | sin(2δ)
0 | 1      | 90°        | sin(90)=1 | sin(180)=0
1 | 3      | 67°        | sin(67) ≈0.9205 | sin(134)=sin(180-46)=sin(46)=0.7193
2 |5       |55°         |sin(55)=approx 0.8192 | sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9397 (Wait, wait, sin(110)=sin(180-70)=sin70=0.9397)
3 |7       |30°         |sin30=0.5 | sin60= ~0.8660
4 |9       |13°         |sin13≈0.22495 | sin26≈0.4384

Wait, let's compute each term:

For l=0:

(2l+1)=1
δ=90°, sin(δ)=1
sin(2δ)=sin(180°)=0
Term = 1 * 1 * 0 = 0

l=1:
(2l+1)=3
δ=67°, sin67 ≈ 0.9205
2δ=134°, sin134 = sin(180-46)=sin46≈0.7193
Term = 3 * 0.9205 * 0.7193 ≈ 3 * 0.6621 ≈ 1.9863

l=2:
5
δ=55°, sin55≈0.8192
2δ=110°, sin110=sin70≈0.9397
Term=5 * 0.8192 * 0.9397 ≈5 * (0.8192 * 0.9397)
Compute 0.8192 * 0.9397:
Approximately 0.8192 * 0.9397 ≈ 0.7707
So 5 * 0.7707 ≈3.8535

l=3:
7
δ=30°, sin30=0.5
2δ=60°, sin60≈0.8660
Term=7 * 0.5 * 0.8660 = 7 * 0.433 = approx 3.031

l=4:
9
δ=13°, sin13≈0.22495
2δ=26°, sin26≈0.4384
Term=9 * 0.22495 * 0.4384 ≈ 9 * (0.22495 * 0.4384)
Multiply 0.22495 *0.4384: Let's compute that.

0.22495 * 0.4384 ≈ 0.09867.
Multiply by 9: 9 * 0.09867 ≈ 0.88803

Now, sum all the terms:

l=0: 0
l=1: 1.9863
l=2:3.8535
l=3:3.031
l=4:0.88803

Sum = 0 + 1.9863 +3.8535 = 5.8398; add 3.031 → 8.8708; add 0.88803 → 9.75883.

So total sum is approximately 9.75883.

So Im(f(0)) = (1/k) * 9.75883.

Wait, but what is k? k is the wave number, which is 2π/p, where p is the momentum. Alternatively, for electrons, we can relate the energy to the momentum using the relativistic relation.

Wait, the electrons have energy E=50 MeV. Since 50 MeV is much higher than their rest mass (0.511 MeV), we can treat them as ultra-relativistic. In that case, the energy E ≈ pc, where p is the momentum. So p ≈ E/(c).

But wait, E for a photon is pc, but for an electron, the total energy is γ m c². Since E >> m c², γ ≈ E/(m c²).

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to use the relation for ultra-relativistic electrons: E ≈ pc. So p ≈ E/(c).

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. The energy of an electron is given by the relativistic equation:

E² = (pc)² + (m c²)²

For E much larger than m c², we can approximate E ≈ pc, so p ≈ E/(c).

Therefore, k is equal to p/ħ. Since ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Let's compute k:

k = p / ħ = (E/(c)) / ħ = E/(ħ c)

But I need to compute this in appropriate units. Let's think in terms of units that would give k in 1/fm, since the answer is in fm.

Wait, but let me compute the numerical value. First, let's get E in units that can be converted into appropriate SI units.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a standard formula or a shortcut for k when E is given.

Wait, another approach: the Compton wavelength. The Compton wavelength λ_c is given by ħ/(m_e c). For an electron, m_e c² is about 0.511 MeV, so m_e c is about 0.511 MeV / c.

Wait, but maybe I'm complicating things. Let me think about the formula:

k = (p) / ħ

And p = gamma m v. But for ultra-relativistic particles, v≈c, so p ≈ gamma m c.

But gamma is E/(m c²). So p = (E/(m c²)) * m c = E/(c). So p = E/(c).

So k = (E/(c)) / ħ = E/(ħ c)

Now, E is 50 MeV. Let me convert E into Joules.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 50 MeV = 50e6 eV = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.

Now, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So k = E/(ħ c) = (8.01e-13 J) / (1.0545718e-34 J s * 3e8 m/s )

Compute denominator: 1.0545718e-34 *3e8 ≈ 3.1637e-26 J m

So k ≈ 8.01e-13 / 3.1637e-26 ≈ (8.01 /3.1637) * 1e13 m^{-1}

Wait 8.01 /3.1637 ≈ approximately 2.533.

So k ≈ 2.533e13 m^-1.

But wait, 1 m is 1e15 fm, so 1 m^-1 is 1e-15 fm. So 2.533e13 m^-1 = 2.533e13 * 1e-15 fm^{-1} = 2.533e-2 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 1 fm is 1e-15 m, so 1 m is 1e15 fm. So 1 m^-1 is 1e-15 fm^-1.

Wait, let me double-check:

k = E/(ħ c) = (8.01e-13 J) / (1.0545718e-34 J s * 3e8 m/s)

Wait, the denominator is ħ c: 1.0545718e-34 *3e8 = 3.1637e-26 J m.

So k = 8.01e-13 / 3.1637e-26 m^{-1} = (8.01e-13)/(3.1637e-26) m^{-1} = approximately 2.533e13 m^{-1}.

Now, 1 m = 1e15 fm, so 1/m = 1e-15 fm^{-1}.

So, 2.533e13 m^{-1} = 2.533e13 * 1e-15 fm^{-1} = 2.533e-2 fm^{-1}.

Wait, but that's a very small k. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because higher energy should lead to larger k. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let's compute k again step by step. Let me compute E in Joules correctly.

E = 50 MeV = 50e6 eV. Each eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 50e6 * 1.602e-19 = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 = 8.01e-13 J.

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So ħ c = 1.0545718e-34 * 3e8 = 3.1637e-26 J·m.

So k = E/(ħ c) = (8.01e-13 J) / (3.1637e-26 J·m) ) = (8.01e-13) / (3.1637e-26) ) m^{-1}.

Compute 8.01e-13 /3.1637e-26 = (8.01 /3.1637) * 1e13.

Calculating 8.01 /3.1637 ≈ 2.533, so 2.533e13 m^{-1}.

Now, convert m^{-1} to fm^{-1}.

Since 1 fm = 1e-15 m, so 1 m = 1e15 fm. Therefore, 1 m^{-1} = 1e-15 fm^{-1}.

So 2.533e13 m^{-1} = 2.533e13 * 1e-15 fm^{-1} = 2.533e-2 fm^{-1}.

That's k ≈ 0.02533 fm^{-1}.

So Im(f(0)) = (1/k) * sum_terms = (1/0.02533 fm^{-1}) ) * 9.75883.

Which is 9.75883 / 0.02533 ≈ let's compute that.

9.75883 / 0.02533 ≈ approximately 385.3 fm.

Wait, that's about 385 fm. But looking at the options, the closest is option A: 87163.4 fm, which is way off. Option B is 355.351 fm, which is close to my calculation but a bit lower. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversions. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the formula for the Compton wavelength.

The Compton wavelength λ_c for an electron is λ_c = ħ/(m_e c) ≈ 2.426e-12 m, which is 2.426 fm.

Wait, but the Compton wavelength relates to the wavelength of a particle when E is much larger than m c². The wavelength λ is given by λ = h/(p) = 2π/(k), since k = p/ħ.

Wait, for an electron with energy E, the momentum p is E/c. So λ = h/(p) = h c/E.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the wavelength that way.

Wait, for E=50 MeV,

λ = h c / E.

h is Planck's constant, which is 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

E=50 MeV = 50e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 8.01e-13 J.

So λ = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / 8.01e-13 = (1.9878e-25) /8.01e-13 = approx 2.48e-13 m.

Wait, 2.48e-13 meters is 2.48 fm (since 1e-15 meters is 1 fm, so 2.48e-13 m = 2480 fm? Wait, no:

Wait, 1e-15 meters is 1 femtometer (fm). So 2.48e-13 meters is 248e-15 meters, which is 248 fm. So λ ≈ 248 fm.

But λ is 2π/k, so k = 2π/λ.

So k = 2π/(248e-15 m) = (6.2832) / (248e-15) m^{-1}.

Wait, 6.2832 /248 ≈ 0.02537.

So k ≈ 0.02537 / (1e-15) m^{-1} → 0.02537e15 m^{-1} = 2.537e13 m^{-1}.

Wait, that matches what I had before. So I didn't make a mistake there.

So Im(f(0)) = (1/k) * sum_terms = (1/ (2.537e13 m^{-1}) ) *9.75883.

Wait, but 1/k is the wavelength, λ = 2π/k. Wait, no, λ = 2π/k → so 1/k = λ/(2π).

Wait, perhaps another approach: since I have k = 2.537e13 m^{-1}, which is 2.537e-2 fm^{-1} (because 1 m^{-1} = 1e-15 fm^{-1}, so 2.537e13 m^{-1} = 2.537e13 * 1e-15 fm^{-1} )= 2.537e-2 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k = 1 / (2.537e-2 fm^{-1}) ) = (1 / 0.02537) fm = approximately 39.42 fm.

So Im(f(0)) = 39.42 fm * 9.75883 ≈ let's compute that.

39.42 *9.75883 ≈ approximately 39 *9.76 ≈ 39 *10 = 390, minus 39 *0.24=9.36 → 390-9.36=380.64. Hmm, but precise calculation:

39.42 *9.75883

Let me compute 39.42 *9 = 354.78

39.42 *0.75883 = approx 39.42 *0.7=27.594, 39.42 *0.05=1.971, 39.42 *0.00883≈0.348. So total ≈27.594 +1.971=29.565 +0.348=29.913.

So total 354.78 + 29.913 ≈ 384.693.

So approximately 384.7 fm.

Wait, but none of the options are near 385. The options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm, my calculation got around 385 fm, but the closest option is B: 355.351 fm. Hmm, but I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the sum of the terms. Let me recheck the sum.

Let's recalculate each term more accurately.

l=0:
(2l+1)=1
δ=90°, sin(90)=1
sin(180)=0
Term=1 *1 *0=0

l=1:
δ=67°, sin(67)=approx 0.92050485345
sin(134°)=sin(46)= approx 0.71933980034
2l+1=3
Term=3 * 0.92050485345 * 0.71933980034
Compute 0.92050485345 *0.71933980034: let me compute 0.9205 *0.7193.

0.92 * 0.7193 = 0.92 *0.7=0.644, 0.92*(0.0193)=0.017756 → total ≈ 0.644 +0.017756=0.661756.

But more accurately:

0.92050485345 * 0.71933980034 ≈ 0.9205 *0.7193 = let me compute:

0.9205 * 0.7 = 0.64435
0.9205 * 0.0193 = approx 0.017756.
Total ≈0.64435 +0.017756=0.662106.

Multiply by 3: 3 * 0.662106=1.986318.

l=2:
δ=55°, sin(55)= approx 0.81915204428
sin(110)=sin70=0.9396926208.
2l+1=5
Term=5 * 0.81915204428 *0.9396926208.

Compute 0.81915204428 *0.9396926208:

Approx 0.81915 *0.93969 ≈ 0.7705.

Multiply by 5: 5 * 0.7705=3.8525.

l=3:
δ=30°, sin=0.5.
sin(60)=√3/2≈0.86602540378.
2l+1=7.
Term=7 *0.5 *0.86602540378=7 *0.43301270189=3.03108891323.

l=4:
δ=13°, sin(13)=approx 0.2249510543.
sin(26)= approx 0.43837114678.
2l+1=9.
Term=9 *0.2249510543 *0.43837114678.

Compute 0.2249510543 *0.43837114678 ≈0.22495 *0.43837 ≈0.09867.

Multiply by 9: 0.88803.

So sum all terms:

l=0: 0
l=1:1.986318
l=2:3.8525
l=3:3.0310889
l=4:0.88803

Adding them up:

0 +1.986318 =1.986318

+3.8525 →5.838818

+3.0310889 →8.8699069

+0.88803 →9.7579369.

So sum is approximately 9.7579369.

So back to Im(f(0)) = (1/k)* sum_terms = (1/k) *9.7579369.

We have k ≈ 2.537e13 m^{-1} = 2.537e-2 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k = 1/(2.537e-2 fm^{-1}) )= (1 /0.02537) fm ≈39.42 fm.

Multiply by sum_terms: 39.42 *9.7579369 ≈ let's compute accurately.

39.42 *9 = 354.78

39.42 *0.7579369 = ?

Compute 39.42 *0.7=27.594

39.42 *0.0579369≈ 39.42 *0.05=1.971, 39.42 *0.0079369≈0.312. So total ≈1.971 +0.312=2.283.

So 27.594 +2.283=29.877.

So 354.78 +29.877=384.657 fm.

Hmm, but none of the options is near 384.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shifts. Another thought: in some conventions, the scattering amplitude is proportional to the sum of (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} [sin(lθ + δ_l)].

Wait, wait, perhaps the formula for f(θ) is (1/k) sum (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l)].

Wait, so when θ=0, sin(lθ +δ_l)= sin(δ_l).

So the formula for f(0) is (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin(δ_l).

The imaginary part would be (1/k) sum (2l+1) [Im(e^{2iδ_l} sin(δ_l)) ].

e^{2iδ} = cos(2δ) + i sin(2δ).

So Im(e^{2iδ} sin(δ)) = sin(2δ) * sin(δ).

So, yes, as I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units for k. Let me recompute k.

Alternative approach: compute k in terms of the electron's momentum.

p = E/c, but E is 50 MeV, which is 50e6 eV. But when working with natural units (ħ= c=1), the momentum p is E in units of MeV/c.

Wait, since E=pc in natural units, p = E (MeV/c) → p =50 MeV/c.

But in terms of ħ, which is about 197.33 MeV·fm (since ħc ≈197.33 MeV·fm).

So, p =50 MeV/c → but [p] in MeV/c.

But ħ has units MeV·fm, so k = p/(ħ) → units (MeV/c) / (MeV·fm) ) → 1/(c fm) → but perhaps it's easier to compute numerically.

Wait, k = p / ħ.

p =50 MeV/c.

But ħc ≈197.33 MeV·fm.

So, ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c → but perhaps better to compute k as:

k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm/c) ) → the c's cancel, so 50/(197.33 fm^{-1}) → approximately 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Ah! So k ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that's a much larger k than before. Where did I go wrong earlier?

Ah, perhaps I messed up the unit conversions earlier. Let me try this approach.

In natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, the momentum p is E (since E=pc). So p = E =50 MeV.

But to convert p into units of fm^{-1}, we note that ħ c ≈197.33 MeV·fm.

So, 1 fm^{-1} = (197.33 MeV) / (1 fm * c) ) → but perhaps a better way is:

k = p / ħ = (50 MeV) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) → 50/197.33 fm^{-1}.

So 50/197.33 ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

Aha! That makes more sense. So k ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So now, Im(f(0)) = (1/k) * sum_terms = (1/0.253 fm^{-1}) ) *9.7579369 ≈3.9526 *9.7579369.

Wait, wait, 1/k = 1/0.253 ≈3.9526 fm.

Multiply by 9.7579369 →3.9526 *9.7579369 ≈38.58 fm.

Wait, that's about 38.6 fm. But that's still not matching any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me try to compute k again.

Alternative approach: The wave number k is given by k = (2mE)^{1/2}/ħ, but that applies for non-relativistic particles. But since the electron is highly relativistic, this formula isn't applicable. So the previous approach with k = E/(ħ c) might be more appropriate.

Wait, but let's compute it correctly.

Given E =50 MeV,

k = E/(ħ c) → but let's ensure the units are correct.

ħ c ≈197.33 MeV·fm.

So, E=50 MeV,

k = 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV·fm ) = 50/(197.33) fm^{-1} → approximately 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Thus, 1/k = 3.953 fm.

So Im(f(0)) = (1/k) * sum_terms = 3.953 fm *9.7579369 ≈3.953 *9.7579369.

Calculating:

3.953 *9=35.577,

3.953 *0.7579369≈3.953 *0.7=2.7671, 3.953 *0.0579369≈0.2283 → total≈2.995.

So total Im(f(0)) ≈35.577+2.995=38.572 fm.

Wait, that's about 38.6 fm. But the options are much larger.

Hmm, the options are in the hundreds or thousands. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of the terms.

Wait, let me double-check the sum.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of each term. Let me recompute each term accurately.

Recomputing each term:

l=0: δ=90°
(2l+1)=1
sin(δ)=1
sin(2δ)=0
Term=1 *1 *0=0.

l=1: δ=67°
(2l+1)=3
sin(67)=approx 0.92050485345
sin(134°)=sin(46)= approx 0.71933980034
Term=3 *0.92050485345 *0.71933980034.

Compute 0.92050485345 * 0.71933980034 accurately:

0.92050485345 *0.71933980034 → let me compute:

0.92050485345 * 0.7 = 0.6443534

0.92050485345 * 0.01933980034 ≈0.92050485345 *0.0193398 ≈ let's compute 0.9205 *0.0193398.

0.92 *0.0193398 = 0.017756.

0.00050485345 *0.0193398 ≈ ~0.00000975.

So total ≈0.017756 +0.00000975 ≈0.01776575.

Thus, 0.6443534 +0.01776575 ≈0.66211915.

Multiply by 3 →3 *0.66211915=1.98635745.

l=2: δ=55°
(2l+1)=5
sin(55)=0.81915204428
sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9396926208.

Term=5 *0.81915204428 *0.9396926208.

Compute 0.81915204428 *0.9396926208:

=0.81915 *0.93969 ≈0.7705.

Multiply by 5:5 *0.7705=3.8525.

l=3: δ=30°
(2l+1)=7
sin(30)=0.5
sin(60)=0.86602540378.

Term=7 *0.5 *0.86602540378 =7 *0.43301270189=3.03108891323.

sin(13)=0.2249510543
sin(26)=0.43837114678.

Term=9 *0.2249510543 *0.43837114678.

Compute 0.2249510543 *0.43837114678:

=0.22495 *0.43837 ≈0.09867.

Multiply by9 →0.88803.

Now sum the terms:

l=0:0

l=1:1.98635745

l=2:3.8525

l=3:3.03108891323

l=4:0.88803

Sum = 1.98635745 +3.8525 =5.83885745 +3.03108891323 =8.86994636 +0.88803 =9.75797636.

So sum is approximately 9.757976.

So Im(f(0)) = (1/k) * sum_terms = (1/k) *9.757976.

Earlier, when k=0.253 fm^{-1}, 1/k=3.9526 fm.

3.9526 *9.757976 ≈3.95*9.758=38.59 fm.

Hmm, but none of the options are close to 38.59. The options are all much higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem considers the sum over all possible l, but the given phase shifts are δ_0 to δ_4. But the formula I used includes each term correctly.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to multiply by (2l+1) for each term. No, I think I did that.

Another possibility: maybe the imaginary part is the sum of (2l+1) sin(δ_l) sin(2δ_l) multiplied by 1/k, but perhaps I missed a factor.

Wait, the formula for f(θ) is (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l).

So the imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) [Im(e^{2iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l))].

Which is (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ sin(2δ_l) * sin(lθ + δ_l) ].

Wait, no, when θ=0, it's sin(δ_l).

Wait, when I expand e^{2iδ} sin(δ), I get [cos(2δ) + i sin(2δ)] * sin(δ).

So the imaginary part is sin(2δ) * sin(δ).

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct formula for the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) [ (sin δ_l sin 2δ_l) ] / (k).

Which is what I did.

But perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1) [ (sin δ_l sin 2δ_l) ] / k.

Which is the same as I did.

Wait, but in that case, with k=0.253 fm^{-1}, Im(f(0))= sum_terms /k =9.757976/0.253 fm^{-1}.

Wait, no: wait, 1/k is 3.9526 fm.

So 9.757976 *3.9526 fm ≈38.59 fm.

Hmm, but the options are way higher.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units for k. Let me consider if k is in inverse meters, but I'm supposed to convert to inverse femtometers.

Wait, another approach: since k = p/(ħ),

p = E/(c) → E=50 MeV,

But in units where ħ c =197.33 MeV fm, so p =50 MeV/c.

Then, k = p/(ħ) = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) → the MeV and c cancel,

k =50/(197.33) fm^{-1} → approximately 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k= 3.9526 fm.

Thus, Im(f(0))=3.9526 *9.757976 ≈38.59 fm.

But the options are all in the hundreds or thousands. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the scattering amplitude. Another possibility: perhaps the sum should include (2l+1) times e^{2iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l), and the imaginary part is the sum of (2l+1) [ sin(2δ_l) sin(lθ + δ_l) ].

But when θ=0, it's (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin(δ_l).

But wait, perhaps the formula is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using non-relativistic units, but that seems unlikely as the energy is 50 MeV, which is relativistic.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k correctly in terms of the wavelength.

Another approach: the wavelength λ is given by λ = h/(p).

p is the momentum. E=K + m c², but for high energy, E≈pc.

So p ≈E/c =50 MeV/c.

h = 6.626e-34 J.s.

But we can use the relation λ = h/(p).

But E=50 MeV =50e6 eV.

Each eV =1.602e-19 J.

So p= E/c =50e6 eV * (1.602e-19 J/eV) / (3e8 m/s) ) = (8.01e-13 J) / (3e8 m/s) ) = 2.67e-21 kg m/s.

Wait, kg m/s is the unit of momentum.

So λ = h/p =6.626e-34 J s / (2.67e-21 kg m/s) ) = (6.626e-34) / (2.67e-21) m ≈2.483e-13 m → 2.483e-13 m =2.483 fm.

So k =2π/λ ≈6.2832 /2.483 fm ≈2.53 fm^{-1}.

Hmm, that's different from before. So k=2.53 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that's 2.53 fm^{-1}.

So Im(f(0))= sum_terms /k =9.757976 / (2.53 fm^{-1}) )=3.857 fm.

Hmm, but that's still not matching any option.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting values for k depending on the approach. Let's try to find a more reliable way.

Alternative approach: Use the relation between the scattering amplitude f and the optical theorem.

Wait, the optical theorem states that the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is equal to the total cross-section times 1/(4π).

But I'm not sure if that helps here because I don't have the cross-section.

Wait, maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula Im(f(0)) = (1/(4π)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin(δ_l) ) * (something).

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Another thing I'm confused about is the units—perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of 1/fm or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts.

Okay, from scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l)

The imaginary part of f(θ) is then:

Im[f(θ)] = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin(lθ + δ_l)

At θ=0, this becomes:

Im[f(0)] = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin(δ_l)

Which is what I used earlier.

So, the sum I calculated is correct. So perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of k.

Let me compute k accurately.

E=50 MeV.

In natural units, ħ=1, c=1.

So, E =50 MeV.

Momentum p = E/c → but if c=1, p=E → p=50 MeV.

But to convert p into units of fm^{-1}, since ħ c ≈197.33 MeV fm, we have p =50 MeV → p =50 / (197.33 MeV fm) ) fm^{-1}.

So p =50/197.33 ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So k = p =0.253 fm^{-1}.

Thus, 1/k =3.9526 fm.

Now, Im(f(0))=3.9526 fm *9.757976 ≈38.59 fm.

But the options are way higher. So perhaps the problem is not considering the correct phase shifts or something else.

Wait, looking back at the question, it says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts. So perhaps the sum includes only the given phase shifts, which we did.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is over all l, but the given phase shifts are from l=0 to l=4, and higher l's are zero.

But that shouldn't change much.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum. Let me recompute the sum with more precise numbers.

Compute each term with more precision.

l=1:
δ=67°, sin(67)=0.92050485345
sin(134)=sin(46)=0.71933980034.

3 *0.92050485345 *0.71933980034.

Compute 0.92050485345 *0.71933980034:

= (0.92050485345) * (0.71933980034)

Using a calculator: 0.92050485345 *0.71933980034 ≈0.662106.

Multiply by3: 1.986318.

l=2:

5 *0.81915204428 *0.9396926208.

Compute 0.81915204428 *0.9396926208.

=0.81915204428 *0.9396926208 ≈0.7705.

Multiply by5:3.8525.

l=3:

7 *0.5 *0.86602540378=3.03108891323.

l=4:

9 *0.2249510543 *0.43837114678.

Compute 0.2249510543 *0.43837114678.

=0.09867.

Multiply by9:0.88803.

Adding all terms: 1.986318 +3.8525 +3.03108891323 +0.88803 =9.7579369.

So sum is 9.7579369.

Now, Im(f(0))= (1/k)*sum_terms = (3.9526 fm) *9.7579369 ≈38.59 fm.

But the options are:

A)87163.4 fm

B)355.351 fm

C)177.675 fm

D)251.271 fm

Hmm, none is near 38.59 fm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, when I first calculated the sum, I got approximately 9.758. But looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option B:355.351 fm.

But that would require a much higher Im(f(0)).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another possibility: perhaps the formula for Im(f(0)) is (sum terms ) /k, but perhaps k is in units that give a much larger value.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to multiply by something else. Another approach: perhaps the formula for Im(f(0)) is (1/(4π)) times the sum, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0)) = (sum terms) * (1/(4π k)).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Without knowing the exact formula, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians? Wait, no, the problem says 90 degrees, etc.

Another possibility: perhaps the formula for Im(f(0)) is (sum term) multiplied by 1/(k) but with k in inverse meters, not femtometers.

Wait, let me compute k in inverse meters.

Earlier, k ≈0.253 fm^{-1} → 0.253 fm^{-1} is 0.253 *1e15 m^{-1} → 2.53e14 m^{-1}.

So 1/k = (1/(2.53e14 m^{-1})) )=3.9526e-15 m.

But that would make Im(f(0))=3.9526e-15 m *9.7579369 ≈3.857e-14 m.

Which is 3.857e-14 m =3.857e-2 fm.

But that's even smaller, which doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in scattering amplitude, the units are in inverse length, but the actual value is scaled somehow.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im(f(0)) is (1/(4π)) * sum terms /k.

But I'm not certain about that.

Wait, given that my calculation is leading me to approximately 38.6 fm and the options are much higher, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shifts. Let me look again at the problem statement.

The given phase shifts are: δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, δ4=13°. Did I use all of them correctly? Yes.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another thought: perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) sin(2δ_l), without dividing by k.

So, 9.7579369 * (1/k) → but if k is 0.253 fm^{-1}, 1/k is 3.9526 fm → 9.7579*3.9526=38.59 fm.

But that doesn't match any option.

Wait, looking at option B:355.351 fm.

If I compute 38.59 *9.22, I get roughly 355 fm. So why would that be the case?

Wait, perhaps I forgot to multiply by (ħ c), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is supposed to be multiplied by 1/(4π) or another factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, not degrees, but the problem states they're in degrees.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum in radians.

Let me try that.

Compute each term using radians:

l=0:
δ₀=90°=π/2 radians.
sin(δ)=1
sin(2δ)=sin(π)=0 → term=0.

l=1:
δ=67°=1.16937 radians.
sin(δ)=sin(1.16937)=0.92050485345.
sin(2δ)=sin(2.33874)=sin(134 degrees)=0.71933980034.
Term=3 *0.92050485345 *0.71933980034=1.986318.

Same as before.

So the sum remains 9.7579369.

So the same problem.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im(f(0)) is sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) sin(2δ_l) * (ħ c).

Because in some cases, the scattering amplitude is expressed in terms of cross-sections which involve ħ c.

So, maybe Im(f(0)) = (sum_terms ) * ħ c / E.

But ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm.

E is 50 MeV.

So, Im(f(0)) =9.7579369 *197.33 MeV fm /50 MeV → (9.7579369 *197.33)/50 fm.

Compute 9.7579369 *197.33 ≈ 9.758 *197.33 ≈1928.5.

Divide by50:1928.5/50=38.57 fm.

Same as before.

So I'm back to the same result.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the phase shifts. Another possibility: perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but I used degrees. But in that case, the sines would be much smaller, leading to a smaller sum.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are in degrees but I should treat them as radians. Let's try that.

Compute the sum again, treating each δ in radians.

l=0:90 degrees=pi/2=1.5708 radians.
sin(pi/2)=1.
sin(2*pi/2)=sin(pi)=0 → term=0.

l=1:67 degrees=1.16937 radians.
sin(1.16937)=0.92050485345.
sin(2*1.16937)=sin(2.33874)=approx 0.71933980034.
Term=3 *0.92050485345 *0.71933980034=1.986318.

Same as before.

Same sum, 9.7579369.

So again, same problem.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin(lθ + δ_l) divided by (k).

But that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B:355.351 fm.

But how?

Let me see what would give 355 fm.

If Im(f(0))=355 fm, then sum_terms= k*355.

But with k=0.253 fm^{-1}, sum_terms=0.253 *355=90.065.

But our sum is 9.7579369, which is way lower.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the sum.

Wait, let's recompute the sum with more accurate numbers.

l=0:0.

l=1:3 * sin(67) * sin(134).

Compute sin(67 degrees) =0.92050485345.

sin(134 degrees)=sin(46 degrees)=0.71933980034.

3 *0.92050485345 *0.71933980034=3*(0.92050485345 *0.71933980034).

Compute 0.92050485345 *0.71933980034:

= (0.92050485345 *0.71933980034)= 0.662106.

Multiply by3:1.986318.

l=2:5 * sin(55)*sin(110).

sin(55)=0.81915204428.

sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9396926208.

5 *0.81915204428 *0.9396926208=5*(0.81915204428 *0.9396926208).

Compute 0.81915204428 *0.9396926208=0.7705.

Multiply by5:3.8525.

l=3:7 * sin(30)*sin(60)=7*0.5*(√3/2)=7*(0.5 *0.86602540378)=7*0.43301270189=3.03108891323.

l=4:9 * sin(13)*sin(26).

sin(13)=0.2249510543.

sin(26)=0.43837114678.

9 *0.2249510543 *0.43837114678=9*(0.2249510543 *0.43837114678).

0.2249510543 *0.43837114678≈0.09867.

Multiply by9: 0.88803.

Summing all terms:

0 +1.986318 +3.8525 +3.03108891323 +0.88803=9.7579369.

Hmm, same as before.

So I'm confident that the sum is correct.

Thus, I'm forced to conclude that either the correct answer is not listed, or I made a mistake somewhere. But since the options are presented, perhaps I should choose the closest option to my result. But none are close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in terms of wavelength λ.

Another approach: compute the wavelength λ.

λ = h/(p) = h c / (E).

Because E=pc → p= E/c → λ= h c / E.

h =6.626e-34 J.s.

c=3e8 m/s.

E=50 MeV=50e6 eV *1.602e-19 J/eV=8.01e-13 J.

So λ = (6.626e-34 *3e8) /8.01e-13 = (1.9878e-25) /8.01e-13 = approx 2.48e-13 m.

1e-13 meters is 0.1 femtometers, so 2.48e-13 m=24.8 fm.

Wait, but wait: 1e-15 meters is 1 fm, so 2.48e-13 m=248 fm.

So λ=248 fm.

k=2π/λ →2π /248 fm ≈ 2.53e-2 fm^{-1}.

So k=0.0253 fm^{-1}.

Thus, 1/k=39.53 fm.

Im(f(0))=39.53 fm *9.7579369 ≈385.3 fm.

Wait, that's approximately 385.3 fm, which is very close to option B:355.351 fm. Hmm, but not exactly.

Wait, perhaps my calculation of λ is incorrect. Let me recompute λ.

λ= (h c) / E.

h=6.626e-34 J.s.

c=3e8 m/s.

E=50 MeV=50e6 eV *1.602e-19 J/eV =8.01e-13 J.

So λ= (6.626e-34 *3e8) /8.01e-13.

Compute numerator:6.626e-34 *3e8=1.9878e-25.

Divided by8.01e-13:1.9878e-25 /8.01e-13 =2.482e-13 m.

Which is 248.2e-15 m =248.2 fm.

So k=2π/λ=2π/(248.2e-15 m)=2π/(248.2e-15) m^{-1}.

But 248.2e-15 m =248.2 fm → 248.2 fm =248.2e-15 m.

So 1/(248.2e-15 m)=4.022e12 m^{-1}.

So k=2π *4.022e12 m^{-1} ≈2.525e13 m^{-1}.

Convert to fm^{-1}: 1 m^{-1}=1e-15 fm^{-1}.

So k=2.525e13 m^{-1} =2.525e-2 fm^{-1}.

Thus, 1/k=39.53 fm.

Im(f(0))=39.53 fm *9.7579369≈385.3 fm.

Hmm, which is very close to option A:87163.4 fm, but that's way higher. Wait, no, option A is way higher. Option B is 355.351 fm, which is a bit lower than my result.

But perhaps the mistake is that I should multiply by 1/(4π), which is approximately 0.7958.

So 385.3 *0.7958≈306.9 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for Im(f(0)) is sum_terms multiplied by (ħ c)/(k E).

Wait, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = sum_terms * (ħ c)/E.

So sum_terms=9.7579369.

ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

E=50 MeV.

So Im(f(0))=9.7579369 *197.33 MeV fm /50 MeV →9.7579369 *3.9466 fm ≈38.59 fm.

Same as before.

Hmm.

I think I've tried all possible approaches and I can't get to any of the provided options. The only thing I can think of is that perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but that doesn't change the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different formula, such as Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) without considering the sin(2δ_l) term. But that would give a different result.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum as (2l+1) sin(δ_l) [not multiplied by sin(2δ_l)], but that would be incorrect.

In that case, the sum would be:

l=0:0.

l=1:3*1=3.

l=2:5*0.81915=4.09575.

l=3:7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9*0.22495=2.02455.

Sum=3+4.09575=7.09575 +3.5=10.59575 +2.02455=12.6203.

Multiply by 1/k=39.53 fm →12.6203 *39.53 ≈500 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) multiplied by (something else).

But without knowing the correct formula, it's hard to proceed.

Perhaps the intended answer is option B:355.351 fm, but I can't see how to get there with the given data.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the phase shifts are to be treated as in radians, but I used degrees. Let me try that.

Compute each term using radians:

l=0:
δ=90°=pi/2=1.5708 rad.
sin(δ)=1
sin(2δ)=sin(pi)=0 → term=0.

l=1:
δ=67°=1.16937 rad.
sin(1.16937)=0.92050485345.
sin(2.33874)=0.71933980034.
Term=3 *0.92050485345 *0.71933980034=1.986318.

Same as before.

Thus, sum remains 9.7579369.

Same problem.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities and can't find an error in my approach. Given that, I'll have to proceed with the calculated value of approximately 385 fm, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option B:355.351 fm, which is close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k correctly using the relation k= (2mE)^{1/2}/ħ for non-relativistic case, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the wave number k is given by k = (m v)/ħ, where v is velocity.

But for relativistic particles, v ≈c.

So k ≈ (m c)/ħ = (m c²)/(ħ c) )= (m c²)/(ħ c) )= m c/(ħ).

But m c² for electron is 0.511 MeV.

So m c/(ħ) = (0.511 MeV) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) →0.511 /197.33 ≈0.00259 fm^{-1}.

Thus, k=0.00259 fm^{-1}.

1/k=386 fm.

Which gives Im(f(0))=386 *9.7579369 ≈3765 fm.

But that's way higher than any option.

I'm really stuck here. Based on my calculations, the correct answer should be around 385 fm, but since that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in a different unit or there's a miscalculation somewhere.

Given the options, the closest I can get is option B:355.351 fm. Perhaps the intended answer is option B, but I can't reconcile the numbers exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum somewhere.

The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \), for elastic scattering of \( 50 \, \text{MeV} \) electrons from a nuclear target. The phase shifts are given as \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \), and the rest are ignored. The formula for \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \) is derived from scattering theory:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \sin(\delta_l),
\]

where \( k \) is the wave number. The calculation proceeds as follows:

1. **Wave Number \( k \):**  
   The wave number \( k \) is related to the momentum \( p \) by \( k = p / \hbar \). For ultra-relativistic electrons, \( p \approx E/c \), where \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \). Using \( \hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm} \),  
   \[
   k = \frac{E}{\hbar c} = \frac{50}{197.33} \, \text{fm}^{-1} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
   \]

2. **Sum of Terms:**  
   The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude involves summing over the contributions from each angular momentum \( l \). For \( \theta = 0 \), the terms simplify to:  
   \[
   \text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \sin(\delta_l).
   \]
   The contributions for \( l = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \) are calculated as follows:
   - \( l = 0 \): \( (2l+1) = 1 \), \( \sin(2\delta_0) = \sin(180^\circ) = 0 \), term = \( 0 \).
   - \( l = 1 \): \( (2l+1) = 3 \), \( \sin(67^\circ) \approx 0.9205 \), \( \sin(134^\circ) \approx 0.7193 \), term \( \approx 3 \cdot 0.9205 \cdot 0.7193 \approx 1.9863 \).
   - \( l = 2 \): \( (2l+1) = 5 \), \( \sin(55^\circ) \approx 0.8192 \), \( \sin(110^\circ) \approx 0.9397 \), term \( \approx 5 \cdot 0.8192 \cdot 0.9397 \approx 3.8535 \).
   - \( l = 3 \): \( (2l+1) = 7 \), \( \sin(30^\circ) = 0.5 \), \( \sin(60^\circ) \approx 0.8660 \), term \( \approx 7 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.8660 \approx 3.031 \).
   - \( l = 4 \): \( (2l+1) = 9 \), \( \sin(13^\circ) \approx 0.22495 \), \( \sin(26^\circ) \approx 0.4384 \), term \( \approx 9 \cdot 0.22495 \cdot 0.4384 \approx 0.888 \).

   Summing these terms gives:
   \[
   \text{Sum} = 0 + 1.9863 + 3.8535 + 3.031 + 0.888 \approx 9.7588.
   \]

3. **Final Calculation:**  
   Using \( \text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{k} \cdot \text{Sum} \), and \( k \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1} \),  
   \[
   \text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{9.7588}{0.253} \, \text{fm} \approx 38.59 \, \text{fm}.
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options:**  
   The calculated value of \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \approx 38.59 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. The closest option is \( \text{B: } 355.351 \, \text{fm} \), but this is significantly larger than the computed result. Despite extensive recalculations and unit conversions, the discrepancy remains unresolved.

Given the provided options and the calculations, the most reasonable choice is:
