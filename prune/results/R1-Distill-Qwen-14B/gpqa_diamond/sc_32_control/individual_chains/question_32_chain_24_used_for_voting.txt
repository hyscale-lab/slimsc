Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of RHIC such that the speed of a certain nucleus, X, is 0.96c. Hmm, right, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions at high energies. 

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium-7 isotope has 3 neutrons because it has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, right? So the mass number is 7. So X is a lithium-7 nucleus, Li-7.

So the mass of the nucleus is important here. I think I'll need the rest mass of the Li nucleus. But wait, each nucleon (proton and neutron) has a mass, so the total rest mass is approximately the sum of the individual masses. But actually, the nucleus's rest mass is a bit less than the sum because of binding energy, but maybe for this problem, we can approximate it as the sum of the individual protons and neutrons. Or perhaps I should look up the exact mass of the lithium-7 nucleus.

Wait, but I don't have exact values memorized. Maybe I can recall that the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So for Li-7, which has 3 protons and 4 neutrons, wait wait no, wait. Wait, wait no, the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So if it's Li, which normally has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons, that makes it lithium-6. Wait no, wait, wait. Let me think. Wait, Li is element 3, so 3 protons. So if it has 3 neutrons, that's 3 + 3 = 6, so it's Li-6. Wait, but the problem says Li with 3 neutrons. So is that Li-6 (3 protons, 3 neutrons) or Li-7 (3 protons, 4 neutrons)? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, the problem states X is Li with 3 neutrons. So the nucleus has 3 protons (since it's Li) and 3 neutrons. So total mass number is 6. So it's a lithium-6 nucleus. So the mass is approximately 6 nucleons. Each proton is about 938 MeV/c², each neutron about 939.5 MeV/c².

But wait, actually, the exact rest mass of light nuclei can be found using known data. So perhaps I should look up the binding energy or use the approximate mass. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the relativistic energy formula.

The question is about finding the energy of the collider when the speed is 0.96c. So for relativistic particles, the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

So first, I'll calculate gamma for v = 0.96c.

v = 0.96c. So beta is 0.96. Then, beta squared is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me calculate 1 - 0.9216: that's 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = approx 3.5714. Let me calculate that more accurately. Let's compute sqrt(0.0784). 

Wait, 0.28^2 is 0.0784, yes. So correct. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... so about 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the lithium nucleus. So each proton is about 938 MeV, each neutron about 939.56 MeV. So for Li-6, 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So total rest mass energy is (3 * 938) + (3 * 939.56) MeV.

Calculating that: 3 * 938 = 2814 MeV. 3 * 939.56 is about 2818.68 MeV. So total is 2814 + 2818.68 = 5632.68 MeV. But wait, that's 5.63268 GeV.

Wait, but that's without considering the binding energy. The actual mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons. So the binding energy is the mass deficit. But for heavy ions, the binding energy can't be neglected. Wait, but how much is the binding energy for lithium-6?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let me think. I can look up the atomic mass of lithium-6. The atomic mass includes electrons too, but since the nucleus is being considered, perhaps it's better to use the nuclear mass. Alternatively, perhaps the problem gives me the mass or expects me to approximate.

Wait, but I think for the sake of this problem, maybe the rest mass of the nucleus is considered as the sum of the individual protons and neutrons, but adjusted by the binding energy. Or maybe it's easier to compute using the rest mass of the entire nucleus, which I can find from standard tables.

Wait, but I don't have the exact value here. Alternatively, perhaps I can get the approximate mass of the Li-6 nucleus in MeV/c². Let me think: The mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So 3*(938.272 + 939.565) = 3*(1877.837) = 5633.511 MeV/c². But wait, that's the sum of the individual nucleons. However, the actual nuclear mass is less because of binding energy.

Wait, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is less than 6 times the mass of a proton (since protons have higher mass than neutrons). Let me check. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the atomic mass of Li-6.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.015122 u. The atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.015122 u * 931.5 MeV/c²/u = approx 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, but more accurately:

6.015122 * 931.5 = let me compute that.

6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.015122 * 931.5 ≈ 0.015122 * 900 = 13.61, and 0.015122 * 31.5 ≈ ~0.477. So total 13.61 + 0.477 ≈ 14.087.

So 5589 + 14.087 = 5603.087 MeV, which is about 5.603 GeV.

Wait, but wait. The atomic mass includes electrons. Since the nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 electrons in neutral state. So the atomic mass is the mass of the nucleus plus electrons. But for a nucleus moving at high energy, the electrons are negligible, but perhaps in the rest mass of the nucleus, we need to subtract the electrons' mass. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply looking for the calculation using the rest mass of the Li nucleus, and for that, it's taking the rest mass as the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem simplifies and assumes that the rest mass is approximately the sum of the individual nucleons, but adjusted by their binding energy. But without exact numbers, it's tricky.

Wait, maybe I should proceed with the calculation using the approximate rest mass of 5.6 GeV. Wait, but let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the particle in the collider is the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy. The question is about the energy of the collider, which is usually the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy, but wait, no—wait, wait, in particle physics, the energy of the beam is often given as the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. Wait, but sometimes, especially in colliders, they refer to the total energy (gamma * m c²). So I need to clarify that.

Wait, actually, in colliders, the energy per particle is usually given as the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. So the total energy is K + m c². Or wait, no: the total energy is gamma * m c², which includes the rest energy (m c²) and the kinetic energy (K = (gamma - 1) m c²).

But in this question, when they say the energy of RHIC is so that the speed is 0.96c, I think they are referring to the total energy per ion. So I'll proceed under that assumption.

So first, I need gamma. As calculated earlier, gamma ≈ 3.5714.

Next, the rest mass energy (m c²) of the Li-6 nucleus.

If the Li-6 nucleus has a rest mass of about 5.603 GeV (from earlier calculation), then the total energy is gamma * m c² = 3.5714 * 5.603 GeV.

Let me compute that: 3.5714 * 5.603.

Well, 3.5 *5.6 is 19.6. But more accurately:

3.5714 * 5.603 ≈ 

Let me compute step by step.

5.603 * 3 = 16.809

5.603 * 0.5 = 2.8015 → 3.5 gives 19.6105

5.603 * 0.0714 ≈ 0.399 (since 0.07*5.603 ≈ 0.392, 0.0014*5.603≈0.00784 → ~0.3998)

So total approx 19.6105 + 0.3998 ≈ 20.0103 GeV.

Wait, but that's an approximation. Let me be more precise.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 3.5714 * 5.603:

3.5714 × 5.603

= (3 + 0.5 + 0.0714) × 5.603

= 3*5.603 + 0.5*5.603 + 0.0714*5.603

= 16.809 + 2.8015 + 0.3998 → 16.809 + 2.8015 is 19.6105, plus 0.3998 is 20.0103.

So about 20.01 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close but a bit higher. Option D is 21.419 GeV, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me double-check.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015122 u. To convert to MeV/c², multiply by 931.5 MeV/u:

6.015122 u * 931.5 MeV/u ≈ let's compute this.

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.015122 * 931.5 ≈ 0.015122 * 900 = 13.61, 0.015122 * 31.5≈0.477. So 13.61 + 0.477=14.087 MeV.

So total: 5589 +14.087= 5603.087 MeV, which is 5.603087 GeV.

Wait, but this is the atomic mass including electrons. For a nucleus, we need to subtract the electrons. A neutral Li atom has 3 electrons. So the mass of the nucleus is the atomic mass minus the mass of 3 electrons.

Each electron has a mass of about 0.00054858 u. So 3 electrons: 0.00164574 u.

So the nuclear mass is 6.015122 u - 0.00164574 u = 6.013476 u.

Wait, converting that to MeV/c²: 6.013476 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 

6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.013476 * 931.5 ≈ 0.013 *931.5= approx 12.11 MeV, 0.000476 *931.5≈0.445 MeV. So total about 12.11 +0.445=12.555 MeV.

So 5589 + 12.555 = 5601.555 MeV → 5.601555 GeV.

So the rest mass energy is approximately 5.601555 GeV.

Now, compute gamma * m c²:

gamma is 3.5714.

3.5714 * 5.601555 GeV.

Let me calculate that accurately.

3 *5.601555 = 16.804665.

0.5 *5.601555 = 2.8007775.

0.0714 *5.601555 ≈ Let's compute 0.07 *5.601555 = 0.39210885. 0.0014 *5.601555=0.007842177. So total 0.39210885+0.007842177≈0.399951.

Adding all together: 16.804665 + 2.8007775 =19.6054425 + 0.399951=19.6054425 +0.399951=19.6054425 +0.399951= 20.0053935 GeV.

So approximately 20.005 GeV. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close but a bit higher. Wait, perhaps my rest mass is a bit off.

Wait, perhaps the actual rest mass is higher. Let me double-check the exact value. Alternatively, maybe I should be using the exact gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately. v=0.96c, so beta=0.96.

gamma= 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).

Compute beta squared: 0.96^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)= 0.28 exactly, because 0.28^2 = 0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... So 3.57142857 GeV.

Wait, no, gamma is unitless.

So, the exact calculation: gamma=3.57142857.

Now, compute 3.57142857 *5.601555 GeV.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.601555:

Let me compute 3 *5.601555 =16.804665.

0.57142857 *5.601555.

First, 0.5 *5.601555=2.8007775.

0.07142857 *5.601555:

0.07 *5.601555 =0.39210885.

0.00142857 *5.601555≈0.0079999 approx 0.008.

So 0.39210885 +0.008=0.39990885 approximately.

Adding 2.8007775 +0.39990885=3.20068635.

So total 16.804665 +3.20068635=20.00535135 GeV.

So approximately 20.005 GeV.

Looking back at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

The closest is option C, 20.132 GeV. But wait, my result is 20.005 GeV, which is about 20 GeV. Hmm, but option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me check another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the relativistic formula E = gamma * m c², and m is the rest mass of the nucleus. So if the exact value for Li-6 is used, maybe the rest mass is higher. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps the exact mass of Li-6 is 5.603 GeV as per the atomic mass calculation, but subtracting the electrons' mass. Let me recompute that.

Wait, atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.015122 u.

Electron mass is 0.00054858 u per electron. So 3 electrons: 0.00164574 u.

So the nuclear mass is 6.015122 - 0.00164574 =6.01347626 u.

Converting to MeV: 6.01347626 u *931.5 MeV/u = 

Let me compute that:

6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.01347626 *931.5 = let's compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315; 0.00347626 *931.5≈3.237.

So 9.315 +3.237=12.552 MeV.

Total: 5589 +12.552 =5601.552 MeV → 5.601552 GeV.

So same as before.

So, 3.57142857 *5.601552 GeV.

Again, 3.57142857 *5.601552 = ?

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.601552:

I can compute this as (3 + 0.5 + 0.07142857) *5.601552.

3*5.601552=16.804656.

0.5 *5.601552=2.800776.

0.07142857 *5.601552 = approximately:

0.07 *5.601552=0.39210864.

0.00142857 *5.601552≈0.00799999 → 0.008.

So 0.39210864 +0.008=0.39990864.

Adding all: 16.804656 +2.800776=19.605432 +0.39990864=20.0053406 GeV.

So about 20.0053 GeV.

Hmm, but none of the options exactly match this. The closest is option C: 20.132 GeV. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the rest mass I used is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the sum of the individual nucleon masses without considering binding energy. Let me try that approach.

If I calculate the rest mass as 6 nucleons, each being around 938.3 MeV for protons and 939.56 MeV for neutrons.

So 3 protons: 3 * 938.3 =2814.9 MeV.

3 neutrons: 3 *939.56=2818.68 MeV.

Total: 2814.9 +2818.68=5633.58 MeV →5.63358 GeV.

Now, gamma is 3.57142857.

So E =3.57142857 *5.63358 GeV.

Compute that:

3 *5.63358 =16.90074.

0.5 *5.63358=2.81679.

0.07142857 *5.63358≈0.07*5.63358=0.39435, 0.00142857*5.63358≈0.00799999 →0.008. So total 0.39435+0.008=0.39335.

Adding all:16.90074 +2.81679=19.71753 +0.39335=20.11088 GeV.

So approximately 20.1109 GeV.

Hmm, which is closer to option C (20.132 GeV). So perhaps the problem expects the sum of the individual nucleon masses, not considering the binding energy. That would make sense if the problem is a simplified approach.

So the energy is approximately 20.11 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV). So option C is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the lithium-6 (Li-6) nucleus is 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma \cdot m c^2
\]

### Step 1: Calculate $\gamma$
The speed of the nucleus is given as $v = 0.96c$. The Lorentz factor $\gamma$ is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

First, compute $v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216$. Then:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus
The Li-6 nucleus consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using approximate values for the rest mass energy of a proton ($938.3 \, \text{MeV}$) and a neutron ($939.56 \, \text{MeV}$), the total rest mass energy is:

\[
m c^2 = (3 \cdot 938.3) + (3 \cdot 939.56) = 2814.9 + 2818.68 = 5633.58 \, \text{MeV} = 5.63358 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
The total energy of the nucleus is given by:

\[
E = \gamma \cdot m c^2
\]

Substituting $\gamma \approx 3.5714$ and $m c^2 = 5.63358 \, \text{GeV}$:

\[
E = 3.5714 \cdot 5.63358 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:
- $3 \cdot 5.63358 = 16.90074$
- $0.5 \cdot 5.63358 = 2.81679$
- $0.07142857 \cdot 5.63358 \approx 0.39335$

Adding these together:

\[
E = 16.90074 + 2.81679 + 0.39335 \approx 20.11088 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately $20.11 \, \text{GeV}$. Among the given options, the closest value is:

**C) 20.132 GeV**

### Final Answer:
The energy of the RHIC for a Li-6 nucleus traveling at $0.96c$ is best matched by option C.

Answer: C
