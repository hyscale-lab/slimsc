Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. I remember that metrics can describe different kinds of spaces, like spheres or hyperboloids depending on the form.

Wait, so the metric is in terms of x and y, but it's scaled by this function. The denominator is 4 - x² - y². Oh right, that's similar to the standard metric for a sphere. Normally, the metric for a sphere of radius a is something like (dx² + dy²)/(1 - (x² + y²)/a²), but I'm not sure about the exact coefficients here.

But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere usually refers to a hyperbolic space, right? Or maybe it's a 2-dimensional space with constant negative curvature. But how does that tie into the metric here?

Wait, another thought. The metric given has the form (dx² + dy²) multiplied by a function. So it's a 2-dimensional metric, so perhaps the space is a surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space. Or maybe it's a surface in 3D or 4D space.

Wait, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So that's a bit like (a² - x² - y²), which suggests a sphere of radius 2, since 4 is 2 squared. So maybe this metric is describing a sphere of radius 2 in 3D space, but written in 2D coordinates? Or perhaps it's a 2D surface.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, pseudosphere... Oh wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, like a hyperbolic space. But this metric doesn't look like that. Because the standard pseudosphere (like the tractricoid) has a metric that involves hyperbolic functions, perhaps. Or maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, maybe this is a 2D surface with a metric that actually corresponds to a sphere. Let me think about the area. The area of a sphere is 4πr². Since r is 2, that would be 4π*(2)^2 = 16π. But wait, that's not one of the options. The options have 4π times something. Hmm.

Wait, the options are A) 0, B)4π(x²+y²), C)4π(x²−y²), D) +infty. So perhaps the area is a function of x and y, or it's a constant.

Wait, but the metric is given for a surface. The area element in 2D is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Let's compute that.

The metric tensor components are g_xx = 32/(4−x²−y²), g_yy = same, and g_xy = 0 because the cross terms are zero. So the determinant is (32/(4−x²−y²)) * (32/(4−x²−y²)) ) minus 0. So determinant is (32)^2 / (4−x²−y²)^2. Square root of that is 32/(4−x²−y²).

So the area element is (32/(4−x²−y²)) dx dy.

Wait, but what is the area of the entire space? Because if the metric is defined for points where 4 − x² − y² > 0, then x² + y² <4. So the x and y are restricted to a disk of radius 2. So the surface extends over that disk.

But wait, the area would be the integral over all x and y where x² + y² <4 of the area element. So that would be ∫ (32/(4−x²−y²)) dx dy, with x² + y² <4.

But let me try to compute that integral. Switching to polar coordinates might make it easier. Let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy = r dr dθ. The denominator becomes (4 - r²).

So the integral becomes ∫ (32/(4−r²)) * r dr dθ, from r=0 to 2, θ=0 to 2π.

So the area is 32 * ∫ (r dr dθ) / (4−r²). Let's separate the integrals. The θ integral from 0 to 2π is 2π. So Area = 32 * 2π ∫ (r dr)/(4 − r²) from 0 to 2.

Simplify the integral ∫ [r/(4−r²)] dr. Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r², then du = -2r dr → - (du/2) = r dr. So the integral becomes ∫ (r dr)/(4-r²) = - (1/2) ∫ du/u. The limits: when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ -1/(2u) ] du.

Which is equal to (1/2) ∫ (from u=0 to u=4) (1/u) du. Wait, but wait, when u approaches 0, 1/u becomes infinite. So ∫ (1/u) du from 0 to 4 is divergent. So the area would be infinite. Because as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, and the integral diverges.

So the area is infinite. So looking back at the options, option D is +infty.

Wait, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Hmm. But wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Pseudosphere usually has finite area, but maybe in this case, the metric corresponds to a space that's infinitely large?

Alternatively, perhaps the metric represents a space that has infinite area. The given metric is ds^2 = [32/(4−x²−y²)](dx² + dy²). So perhaps as x² + y² approaches 4, the coordinates blow up, leading to an infinite area.

So the area integral diverges, so the area is infinite. So the correct answer is D) +infty.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This metric describes a 2-dimensional surface embedded in a higher-dimensional space. To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we calculate the area element \( dA \), which is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\text{det}(g)} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \( g \) is the metric tensor. For this metric, the components of \( g \) are \( g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \) and \( g_{xy} = g_{yx} = 0 \). The determinant of \( g \) is:

\[
\text{det}(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element is:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

To find the total area, we integrate \( dA \) over the region where \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0 \), which corresponds to the disk \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \). Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \)) and \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \), the integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi \), so:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Let \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \), and \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int \frac{1}{u} \, du \) diverges as \( u \to 0 \), meaning the area is infinite. Therefore, the total area of the pseudosphere described by this metric is \( +\infty \).
