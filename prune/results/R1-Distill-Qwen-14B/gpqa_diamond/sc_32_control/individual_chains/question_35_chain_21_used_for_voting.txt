Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Let me read the problem again to make sure I get all the details.

Ay is given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So S looks like this:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Hmm, so that's matrix S. Then Ay = c * S. So let's compute Ay.

First, c is h/(4π), so:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

So substituting S, Ay becomes:

[ (h/(4π))*0    (h/(4π))*(-i) ]
[ (h/(4π))*i    (h/(4π))*0   ]

Which simplifies to:

[ 0       (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   0      ]

So the matrix Ay is:

0          (-i h)/(4π)
(i h)/(4π)  0

Now, the task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Let's start with the eigenvalues.

The eigenvalues a are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So the matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a         (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)  -a         ]

The determinant of this is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π))*(i h/(4π)) ) ]

So det = a² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) (h²/(4π)^2) ) ]

Wait, (-i)*(i) is (-i^2) which is - (-1) )= 1. Because i * (-i) is (-i²) = -(-1) = 1.

Wait, let me compute it correctly. The product of the off-diagonal elements is (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)).

So that's (-i)(i) * (h^2/(4π)^2).

(-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

So the determinant becomes:

a² - [ (1) * (h^2/(4π)^2) ) ] = 0.

So equation is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) ) = 0.

So a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that calculation. Because I might have made a mistake in the determinant.

Wait, the determinant is (Ay - a I)_{11} * (Ay - a I)_{22} - (Ay - a I)_{12} (Ay - a I)_{21}.

So (Ay - a I)_{11} is 0 - a = -a.

(Ay - a I)_{22} is 0 - a = -a.

(Ay - a I)_{12} is (-i h)/(4π).

(Ay - a I)_{21} is (i h)/(4π).

So determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ]

Which is a² - [ (-i)(i) * (h²/(4π)^2) ]

As I said earlier, (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = 1. So the determinant is a² - [1 * (h²/(16 π²)) ] = 0.

So a² = h²/(16 π²), so a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait. The eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π)?

Wait, but the options don't directly match this. Let me look at the options again.

Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh, real part is ± h/(4π). That doesn't fit because a is real. So the eigenvalues are purely real?

Wait, but Ay is a 2x2 matrix with real entries? Wait, no. Let me see: Ay has elements 0, (-i h)/(4π), (i h)/(4π), 0.

Wait, so the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are imaginary. So the matrix is purely imaginary, except for the zero diagonals. So the eigenvalues of a matrix with zero trace and determinant (h^2)/(16 π²) would be imaginary, perhaps?

Wait, wait. I think I made a mistake here. Let me re-express Ay.

Wait, wait, S is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i  0 ]

So S is a matrix that's a representation of the Pauli matrix σy. So S is i times the Pauli matrix σy. Wait, because the Pauli matrices are:

σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So in S, the matrix is exactly σy. So S = σy.

So Ay = c * σy, where c is h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues of σy are ±i, because σy is a Pauli matrix, which has eigenvalues ±i.

Wait, but wait. No. The eigenvalues of σy are ±i because when you compute their squares, they give identity, etc. So, the eigenvalues of σy are i and -i.

So the eigenvalues of Ay would be c multiplied by these. So that's (h/(4π)) * (i) and (h/(4π))*(-i).

So the eigenvalues a are ± i h/(4π).

Wait, but earlier I thought that the eigenvalues were real, but that might have been a mistake.

Wait, let me clarify. Because S is σy, which has eigenvalues ±i, so when you multiply by c, the eigenvalues are c*(±i) → ±i c.

So the eigenvalues are a = ± i (h/(4π)).

So in terms of real and imaginary parts, the eigenvalues are purely imaginary. So the real part is zero, and the imaginary part is ± h/(4π).

But wait, looking back at the options:

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). That's not right because it's mixing real and imaginary parts.

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. That's not matching either.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate the eigenvalues correctly.

Wait, another approach: the matrix Ay is given. Let me write it again.

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S, and S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So Ay is:

0   (-i h)/(4π)
(i h)/(4π)  0

So the matrix is:

[ 0, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), 0 ]

This is a 2x2 matrix. To find the eigenvalues, solve det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Which gives:

| (-a)    (-i h)/(4π) |
| (i h)/(4π)   (-a) |

The determinant is ( (-a)(-a) ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ]

So a² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h^2)/(16 π²) ) ]

Compute (-i)(i) = (-i²) = - (-1) )= 1.

So determinant: a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0 → a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because I thought the eigenvalues would be imaginary. So where did I go wrong earlier?

Ah! I think I made a mistake in understanding the structure of the matrix. Wait, let me compute the determinant again.

Wait, (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), -a ]

The determinant is (-a)*(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ]

Which is a² - [ (-i)*(i) * (h^2/(4π)^2) ]

(-i)*(i) = (-i²) = 1.

So determinant is a² - ( (1) * h²/(16 π²) ) = 0 → a² = h²/(16π²) → a = ± h/(4π).

But wait, that would imply real eigenvalues, which seems conflicting with the earlier thought that the eigenvalues are imaginary.

Wait, that must be incorrect because the matrix Ay is not Hermitian. Because in quantum mechanics, observable operators are Hermitian, which would have real eigenvalues. But in this case, Ay is not Hermitian because S is anti-Hermitian. Let me check.

The Hermitian conjugate of S is S†. Let me compute S†.

S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

S† is the conjugate transpose, so:

[ 0  i ]
[ -i 0 ]

Which is not equal to S, so S is anti-Hermitian, because S† = -S.

Because S† would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is equal to -S, since S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S† = -S → S is anti-Hermitian.

So when you multiply by a constant, c = h/(4π), then Ay = c * S is also anti-Hermitian, because (Ay)† = c* S† = c*(-S) = - (c S) = -Ay.

So an anti-Hermitian operator has eigenvalues that are purely imaginary.

So this suggests that the eigenvalues of Ay should be imaginary, but my earlier calculation suggested real eigenvalues. So something is wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the determinant.

Wait, the determinant I just did gives a² = h²/(16 π²), so a is real, but that's conflicting with the fact that Ay is anti-Hermitian.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in the setup. Let me re-express the matrix Ay correctly.

Wait, S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So Ay = (h/(4π)) * S is:

[ 0, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), 0 ]

So when you compute the determinant, it's (0 - a)(0 - a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ]

Which is a² - [ ( (-i) * i ) * (h^2/(4π)^2) ]

(-i) * i = -i² = - (-1) = 1.

So the determinant is a² - (1 * h^2/(16 π^2)) )= 0 → a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4 π).

But this suggests real eigenvalues, which would imply that the operator is Hermitian, which it's not. So I must be making a mistake here. Where?

Wait, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect because the matrix is not Hermitian, leading to complex eigenvalues. Wait, no. For any square matrix, eigenvalues can be complex, but for anti-Hermitian matrices, eigenvalues are purely imaginary.

Wait, let me double-check that. Yes, anti-Hermitian matrices have eigenvalues that are purely imaginary. So the eigenvalues should have zero real parts and non-zero imaginary parts.

Hmm. So this suggests that my earlier approach of solving the characteristic equation is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the matrix representation. Let me write the matrix Ay again.

Wait, perhaps I should treat S as a matrix with elements [0, -i; i, 0], so when multiplied by c, which is h/(4π), each element becomes (0, (-i h)/(4π), (i h)/(4π), 0).

Alternatively, perhaps I should write the matrix Ay as:

[ [0, (-i h)/(4π) ],
  [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ] ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues, I'll compute trace and determinant.

Trace is 0 + 0 = 0.

Determinant is (0)(0) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ]

Which is 0 - [ (-i)(i) (h^2/(16 π^2)) ) ]

As before, (-i)(i) = 1. So determinant is - ( h^2/(16 π^2) ) → determinant is negative of that.

Wait, no. Wait, the determinant is (0)(0) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ]

Which is 0 - [ (-i)(i) * (h^2/(16 π^2)) ) ]

(-i)(i) = 1, so determinant is 0 - [1 * h^2/(16 π^2) ) ] = - h^2/(16 π^2).

So the characteristic equation is a² + (h^2/(16 π^2)) ) = 0 → a² = - h^2/(16 π^2) → a = ± i h/(4 π).

Ah! So I made a mistake earlier. The determinant should have a negative sign because the product is (-i h/(4π))*(i h/(4π)) = (-i^2) (h^2/(16 π^2)) )= (1) (h^2/(16 π^2)), but wait no, because (-i)*(i) is (-i^2) which is 1.

Wait, but the product is [ (-i h/(4π)) ] * [ (i h/(4π)) ]

Which is (-i)(i) * (h^2/(16 π^2)) = ( (-i^2) ) * (h^2/(16 π^2)) )

Because i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1, so the product is (1) * h^2/(16 π^2).

Wait, but since it's the product of the off-diagonal terms, the determinant is (0)(0) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ].

So determinant is 0 - [ ( (-i)(i) )*(h^2/(16 π^2)) ) ] → 0 - [ (1) * (h^2/(16 π^2)) ) ] = - h^2/(16 π^2).

So the equation becomes a² - ( - h^2/(16 π^2) ) = 0? No, no. Wait, the characteristic equation is det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So the matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ]

Which is a² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h^2/(16 π^2)) ) ]

But (-i)(i) is 1, so a² - (h^2/(16 π^2)) )= 0 → a² = h^2/(16 π^2) → a = ± h/(4 π).

Wait, but that would suggest real eigenvalues, which can't be right because the matrix is anti-Hermitian.

I think I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach. Let's compute the trace and determinant again.

Trace of Ay is 0 + 0 = 0.

Determinant of Ay is [0 * 0] - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ]

Which is 0 - [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h^2/(16 π^2)) ) ]

(-i)(i) is 1, so determinant is 0 - [ 1 * (h^2/(16 π^2)) ) ] = - h^2/(16 π^2).

So the characteristic equation is a² - Tr(Ay) * a + Det(Ay) = 0 → a² + (- h^2/(16 π^2)) )= 0 → a² = h^2/(16 π^2) → a = ± h/(4 π).

Wait, that brings us back to the same conclusion. Hmm.

But this seems contradictory because the matrix is anti-Hermitian. So it should have purely imaginary eigenvalues, but according to this, the eigenvalues are real.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the determinant.

Wait, another approach. Let me consider that the matrix Ay is [[0, (-i h)/(4π)], [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ].

Let me compute (Ay)†, the Hermitian conjugate.

The Hermitian conjugate is the transpose of the conjugate. So:

The (1,2) element is (-i h)/(4π), so its conjugate is i h/(4π).

The (2,1) element is (i h)/(4π), so its conjugate is (-i h)/(4π).

So (Ay)† is:

[ 0, (i h)/(4π) ]
[ (-i h)/(4π), 0 ]

Which is equal to -Ay. Because Ay is:

[ 0, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), 0 ]

So (Ay)† is the negative of Ay. So Ay is anti-Hermitian.

So for an anti-Hermitian operator, the eigenvalues should be purely imaginary. So perhaps I made a mistake in the determinant calculation.

Wait, perhaps the correct determinant is negative.

Wait, let's compute the determinant again.

The determinant of (Ay - a I) is [(-a)(-a)] - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ]

Which is a² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h^2/(16 π^2)) ) ]

( (-i)(i) ) is (-i² )= 1. So a² - ( h^2/(16 π^2) )=0 → a²= h^2/(16 π^2) → a= ± h/(4 π).

Hmm, but that would give real eigenvalues, which contradicts the property of anti-Hermitian matrices.

Wait a minute, perhaps the product is wrong. Let me compute (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) again.

It's (-i) * i = (-i^2) = 1. But h/(4π) squared is h²/(16 π²). So the product is 1 * h²/(16 π²) → (h²)/(16 π²).

So the determinant is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0 → a²= h²/(16 π²) → a= ± h/(4 π).

But that would imply real eigenvalues, which is not possible for an anti-Hermitian matrix. I must be making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for anti-Hermitian matrices, the eigenvalues are imaginary. So let me think about the correct calculation.

Wait, another approach: Let me represent the matrix Ay as i times a Hermitian matrix.

Let me see: Ay = i * (h/(4π)) * (something Hermitian).

Wait, no. Because S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is equal to i * [[0, 1], [-1, 0]].

Wait, [[0,1], [-1,0]] is the Hermitian Pauli matrix σy. So S = i * σy.

Therefore, Ay = c * S = c * i σy.

So Ay = i c σy. Since σy is Hermitian, i σy is anti-Hermitian.

So eigenvalues of σy are ±i, so eigenvalues of Ay would be i c * (±i) = i c * i and i c * (-i).

Which is i^2 c and -i^2 c. Since i^2 is -1, this becomes (-1)c and (-1)*(-1)c → -c and +c.

Wait, that can't be right because that gives real eigenvalues, which would imply that the operator is Hermitian, which it's not.

Wait, perhaps I've messed up the multiplication.

Wait, let's compute it correctly. σy has eigenvalues ±i. So when you multiply by i, the eigenvalues become i*(±i) = i*±i = ±i^2 = ±(-1) → ±(-1) → ±-1 → -1 and +1.

Wait, so the eigenvalues of i σy would be ±1, which are real. But that can't be, because i σy is anti-Hermitian, which should have purely imaginary eigenvalues.

Hmm, perhaps the eigenvalues are in fact ±i times the constant.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this as follows: let me find the eigenvalues of the matrix Ay.

The matrix Ay is:

[ 0, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), 0 ]

Let me write this as:

a = [0, A; A*, 0], where A = (-i h)/(4π).

So A is (-i h)/(4π), and A* is (i h)/(4π).

The eigenvalues of a matrix of the form [[0, a], [a*, 0]] are ± |a|.

Wait, the eigenvalues are ± |a|, which would be real and positive.

But that can't be right because the matrix is anti-Hermitian, which should have eigenvalues that are purely imaginary.

Wait, let me compute |a|. |a| is sqrt( (Re(a))^2 + (Im(a))^2 ). For a= (-i h)/(4π), Re(a)=0, Im(a)= -h/(4π). So |a|= h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), which are real, but that's conflicting with the anti-Hermitian property.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. Perhaps the eigenvalues are indeed real, but the matrix isn't anti-Hermitian in this scenario.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Ay is anti-Hermitian. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in defining S. Let me see the problem statement again.

The problem says S is a 2x2 matrix, first row (0, -i), second row (i, 0). So S is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Which is the same as the Pauli matrix sigma_y.

So S = σy.

Then, Ay = c * S, where c = h/(4π).

So Ay is c σy.

Wait, σy is Hermitian, because (σy)† = σy.

So if c is real, then Ay is Hermitian, because (Ay)† = c σy† = c σy = Ay.

Wait, but earlier I thought that S is anti-Hermitian, but that's not the case. Because S = σy is Hermitian.

Oh! Wait a minute. So I was wrong earlier. S is Hermitian, not anti-Hermitian.

So let's check:

S† = [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is the same as S because S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], but S† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]] which is not equal to S. Wait, no, that's not correct. S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], and S† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Which is equal to -S because S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] → -S is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which matches S†.

Wait, so S† = -S → S is anti-Hermitian.

But then, if S is anti-Hermitian, then c S is also anti-Hermitian, assuming c is real.

So, in that case, the eigenvalues would be purely imaginary.

So, I think I messed up earlier by considering that S is Hermitian. So, to resolve this, let's clarify:

S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Compute S†:

The (1,2) element is -i → its conjugate is i.

The (2,1) element is i → its conjugate is -i.

So S† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]].

But S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so S† = -S.

Thus, S is anti-Hermitian.

So Ay = c S is anti-Hermitian because (Ay)† = c S† = c (-S) = -c S = -Ay.

Thus, anti-Hermitian operator, eigenvalues are purely imaginary.

So the eigenvalues must be purely imaginary, which would mean that a is a purely imaginary number.

So the earlier calculation must have a mistake. Let me recalculate the determinant.

The matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ]

Which is a² - [ (-i)(i) (h^2/(16 π²)) ) ]

As before, (-i)(i) = 1.

So determinant is a² - (h^2/(16 π²)) = 0.

So a² = h^2/(16 π^2) → a = ± h/(4 π).

But this would give real eigenvalues, which contradicts the anti-Hermitian property.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try another approach. What's the trace and determinant of the matrix Ay?

Trace of Ay is zero.

Determinant is [0 * 0 - (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π))] = 0 - [ ( (-i)(i) ) (h^2/(16 π^2)) ) ].

(-i)(i) is 1, so determinant is - (h^2/(16 π^2)).

So the characteristic equation is a^2 - Tr(Ay)*a + Det(Ay) = a^2 + ( - h^2/(16 π^2) ) = 0 → a^2 = h^2/(16 π^2) → a = ± h/(4 π).

But this can't be right because the eigenvalues should be imaginary.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the eigenvalues are purely imaginary. So let me let a = i b, where b is real.

Substituting into the equation a^2 = h^2/(16 π^2):

(i b)^2 = h^2/(16 π^2) → -b^2 = h^2/(16 π^2) → b^2 = - h^2/(16 π^2).

But that would imply b is imaginary, which can't be because b is real. So this suggests that the eigenvalues are not purely imaginary. But that's impossible because the operator is anti-Hermitian.

I'm getting really confused. Let me think about this again.

Wait, perhaps the matrix is not anti-Hermitian. Let me compute Ay†:

Ay is [[0, (-i h)/(4π) ], [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ]]

The conjugate transpose (Hermitian conjugate) of Ay is:

[ 0, (i h)/(4π) ]
[ (-i h)/(4π), 0 ]

Which is the same as Ay with the sign of the off-diagonal elements flipped. So Ay† is not equal to Ay, which would have made it Hermitian. So Ay is not Hermitian.

But earlier, I thought that S is anti-Hermitian, making Ay anti-Hermitian. But perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me compute Ay† again:

Each element [1,2] is (-i h)/(4π), its conjugate is i h/(4π), so [1,2] in Ay† is i h/(4π).

Element [2,1] in Ay is (i h)/(4π), so its conjugate is (-i h)/(4π).

So Ay† is:

[ 0, (i h)/(4π) ]
[ (-i h)/(4π), 0 ]

Which is equal to negative of Ay.

Because Ay is:

[ 0, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), 0 ]

So Ay† = -Ay → Ay is anti-Hermitian.

Thus, the eigenvalues should be purely imaginary.

So the characteristic equation must have a² + (h^2/(16 π^2)) = 0.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the determinant calculation earlier.

Let me compute the determinant again.

The matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ]

Which is a² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h^2/(16 π^2)) ) ]

As before, (-i)(i) is 1.

So determinant is a² - (h^2/(16 π^2)) = 0 → a² = h^2/(16 π^2) → a = ± h/(4 π).

Hmm. So this suggests real eigenvalues, which contradicts the expectation that the eigenvalues are purely imaginary.

Unless I have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the matrix is not correctly written.

Wait, perhaps the matrix S is not [[0, -i], [i, 0]], but I got it wrong.

Wait, the problem states that the first row is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So S is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the definition of the operator Ay. The problem says Ay = c·S, where c = h/(4π).

So Ay is:

[ 0, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), 0 ]

Which is correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck here. Let me think about the properties of the matrix.

The trace is zero, the determinant is negative (h²/(16 π²) ), so the eigenvalues are ± sqrt( determinant ) → ± i h/(4 π).

Wait, no. Because determinant is (a^2 - (h^2/(16 π²))) = 0 → a^2 = h^2/(16 π^2) → a = ± h/(4 π) → which are real.

But that can't be because the matrix is anti-Hermitian.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should diagonalize the matrix.

Let me try to find the eigenvectors.

Suppose a is an eigenvalue, and [φ1, φ2]^T is the eigenvector.

Then, Ay * [φ1; φ2] = a [φ1; φ2].

So:

0 * φ1 + [ (-i h/(4π)) ] * φ2 = a φ1 → (-i h/(4π)) φ2 = a φ1.

[ (i h/(4π)) ] φ1 + 0 * φ2 = a φ2 → (i h/(4π)) φ1 = a φ2.

So from the first equation: φ1 = [ (-i h/(4π)) / a ] φ2.

Substituting into the second equation:

(i h/(4π)) * [ (-i h/(4π)) / a ] φ2 = a φ2.

Simplify:

(i * (-i) ) * (h^2/(16 π^2)) ) * (1/a) φ2 = a φ2.

i*(-i) = 1, so:

(1) * (h^2/(16 π^2)) ) * (1/a) φ2 = a φ2.

So (h^2/(16 π^2 a)) ) φ2 = a φ2.

Which implies (h^2/(16 π^2 a)) ) = a.

So a² = h^2/(16 π^2) → a= ± h/(4 π).

Which brings us back to the same conclusion: real eigenvalues.

Hmm, but that can't be right because the matrix is anti-Hermitian. So I must have made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me recheck.

The problem states that the operator is Ay = c * S, where c= h/(4π), and S is the given matrix.

Wait, perhaps the matrix S is in the form of a spin component, which is anti-Hermitian, but when multiplied by i, becomes Hermitian.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the intrinsic angular momentum operator has components that are Hermitian, so perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, the intrinsic angular momentum operator J has components Jx, Jy, Jz, which are Hermitian. So perhaps the matrix S in the problem is not correctly normalized, leading to a non-Hermitian operator.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a mistake, but I'm not here to judge that.

Given all this confusion, perhaps the correct eigenvalues are a = ± i h/(4π), which are purely imaginary. But according to the determinant calculation, that's not what I'm getting.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the eigenvalues of S first.

Since S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]], let's find its eigenvalues.

The trace is 0, determinant is (0*0) - (-i)*(i) = 0 - ( (-i^2) ) = 0 - (1) = -1.

So the characteristic equation is a^2 + 1 = 0 → a = ± i.

So the eigenvalues of S are ± i.

Thus, the eigenvalues of Ay = c S are c*(±i) → ± i c.

Which would be ± i (h/(4π)).

So the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, which makes sense.

Then, the real part is zero, and the imaginary part is ± h/(4π).

But looking at the options, the only one that mentions imaginary parts is Option A and B.

Option A: Imaginary parts ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). No, that's not right because the real parts should be zero.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. That also doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the options are using a different scaling. Let me see.

Wait, if the eigenvalues are a = ± i (h/(4π)).

Expressed as a = 0 ± i (h/(4π)).

So the real part is zero, the imaginary part is ± h/(4π).

But none of the options mention this.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

Wait, A^2 would be (Ay)^2, which for spin-1/2 systems, A^2 would have eigenvalues (ħ/2)^2 * ( (1)(1+1)) ) → but I'm not sure. Alternatively, for any spin 1/2 system, the square of the angular momentum component would have eigenvalues (s(s+1)) ħ^2, where s=1/2. So (1/2)(3/2) ħ^2 = (3/4) ħ^2.

But in this case, Ay is proportional to S, which is a spin component matrix.

Wait, perhaps when you square Ay, you get (c^2) (S^2).

S^2 would be [[-1, 0],[0,-1]] because S is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and S^2 is [[-1,0],[0,-1]].

So S^2 = -I.

So Ay^2 = c^2 S^2 = c^2 (-I).

So the eigenvalues of Ay^2 would be -c^2.

Which are real and negative.

Thus, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A^2, because A^2 is a multiple of the identity matrix, and all vectors are eigenfunctions of I.

So option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A^2, which is correct, but they are not eigenfunctions of Az.

So option C could be correct.

Looking at option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. I'm not sure what this means, but perhaps it's talking about the matrix being diagonal in its eigenbasis. That would be correct.

But let's think about each option.

Option A: The eigenvalues' imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't match what I found.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. No.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Since A² is diagonal (as it's a multiple of identity), all eigenvectors of Ay are eigenvectors of A². So this is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions. I'm not exactly sure, but I think this refers to the matrix being diagonal in its own eigenbasis, which is correct.

But wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps I should reevaluate each option.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Since Az is another component of angular momentum, which typically doesn't commute with Ay, so the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions phi are the basis functions of the matrix Ay. I'm not exactly sure what this implies, but perhaps it's about the matrix being diagonal in its eigenbasis, which is always true. So D could be correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, the correct statement is perhaps C.

Because for any matrix, the eigenfunctions form a basis, so D would always be correct, but perhaps the options have another angle.

Alternatively, perhaps D is somewhat ambiguous.

Wait, the question is about the calculation. So during the calculation, which statement is correct.

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh, which doesn't fit. So no.

Option B: same issue.

Option C: correct, because Ay and A² commute (since A² is a multiple of identity), so eigenvectors of Ay are eigenvectors of A².

Option D: correct as well, because any matrix can be diagonalized in its eigenbasis.

But let's think again. The eigenfunctions are the basis functions, which is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

So both options C and D could be correct, but looking back, perhaps the correct option is C, because D is a general statement and the question is about which is correct during the calculation.

Wait, but the question is phrased as which is correct during the calculation.

Hmm. I think option C is correct.

So, to recap, the eigenvalues are pure imaginary ±i (h/(4π)), and the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A^2, which is true because A^2 is proportional to identity.

So the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix given by:

\[
S = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Matrix Representation of \( A_y \):**
   Substituting \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the operator \( A_y \) becomes:
   \[
   A_y = 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   0 & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\
   i \frac{h}{4\pi} & 0
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   To find the eigenvalues, solve the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \):
   \[
   \det 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   -a & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\
   i \frac{h}{4\pi} & -a
   \end{bmatrix}
   = a^2 - \left(-i \frac{h}{4\pi} \cdot i \frac{h}{4\pi}\right) = a^2 - \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2} = 0.
   \]
   Solving this gives:
   \[
   a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
   \]
   However, since \( S \) is anti-Hermitian, \( A_y \) is also anti-Hermitian, meaning its eigenvalues should be purely imaginary. This suggests a reevaluation: the eigenvalues are actually \( a = \pm i \frac{h}{4\pi} \), with zero real parts and imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).

3. **Analysis of Options:**
   - **Option A:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the imaginary parts should be \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), and the real parts are zero.
   - **Option B:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect, as the eigenvalues are purely imaginary with parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) is proportional to the identity matrix, making all eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).
   - **Option D:** Claims that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While technically true, this is a general statement and does not provide specific insight into the calculation.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement during the calculation is **Option C**, as it accurately reflects the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) and \( A^2 \), while also noting their lack of alignment with \( A_z \).

**Answer: C**
