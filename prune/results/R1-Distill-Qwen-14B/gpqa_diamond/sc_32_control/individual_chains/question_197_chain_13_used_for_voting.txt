Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of a nitrile group. Wait, no, wait... Oh right, actually, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of an acid chloride, but maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, when you have a nitrile, sometimes you use H3O+ and heat, but wait, maybe that's the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. Hmm, I need to think about this.

So, the reagents are red phosphorus and HI. Oh wait, I think I remember that when an acid chloride reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it might get converted to a carboxylic acid. Because acid chlorides (RCOCl) when treated with P and HI, the chloride is replaced by iodide, but wait, maybe I'm confusing this with something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is for the conversion of a nitrile to an amine? No, that's usually with H3O+ and heat, like in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amides, then to acids.

Wait, another thought: The reaction of an acid chloride with H2O would give a carboxylic acid, but with P and HI, maybe it's a different pathway. Or perhaps it's the hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amide, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the initial compound X is a nitrile or an acid chloride. Let's look at the IR data to figure that out.

The IR shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹. That broad region often indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But then, there's a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Wait, 1720 is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, that could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, acid, or acid chloride. Another peak at 1610 cm⁻¹ might be aromatic C=C stretching, and 1450 cm⁻¹ could be another aromatic ring vibration.

Oh, and there's a peak around 10.5 ppm in the H NMR, which is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That's a pretty downfield shift, often indicative of an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. But in a carboxylic acid, the proton is usually around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the H would be exchange broadened, as in the NMR. But in this case, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet. So that could be a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Hmm.

Looking at the H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Maybe a carboxylic acid proton. Or maybe an aldehyde, but it's more deshielded than usual.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Aromatic protons, likely para-substituted. If it's a benzene ring with substituents in para positions, each substituent causing the adjacent protons to be in a doublet. So maybe two substituents on the benzene ring.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Could be the other pair of aromatic protons, again para substitution. So the ring is 1,4-disubstituted.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Maybe a CH adjacent to an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. Or perhaps part of a CH₂ group next to something else.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Perhaps a CH₂ group adjacent to another CH or something else.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH₂ or a CH. Like a geminal di-substitution or a branching point.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal methyl group, perhaps part of a longer chain, like an ethyl or propyl group. The triplet suggests it's adjacent to a CH₂.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is a phenyl group with substituents, perhaps a propionyl group attached. Let me try drawing this.

The aromatic protons at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm suggest that the substituents on the benzene are in the para positions. So, if the benzene has two substituents at positions 1 and 4, maybe a group like a carbonyl attached. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group and another is an alkyl chain.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl, which could be an ester, ketone, aldehyde, acid, or acid chloride. The 1720 is a bit on the higher side, so maybe an ester (which is usually around 1730-1750 for C=O), but wait, a carboxylic acid has a C=O around 1700. Hmm. Wait, 1720 could be an acid chloride, as they have higher wavenumbers. But wait, acid chlorides are usually around 1800 cm⁻¹. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, an ester would be around 1720. But the 10.5 ppm in the NMR might suggest a carboxylic acid, but that's conflicting with the IR because if it's a carboxylic acid, the C=O is around 1700, which is a bit lower than 1720.

Wait, maybe it's a ketone. 1720 could be a ketone. But then what about the 10.5 ppm? That would be a problem because ketones don't have protons on the carbonyl. Wait, unless the compound has more than one carbonyl group, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. Aldehyde C=O is around 1720. Then the 10.5 ppm would fit the aldehyde proton. But wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10, maybe 10.5 is possible. But the integration is 1H, which fits.

Wait, let's think about the NMR. The H at 10.5 could be an aldehyde, and the IR's 1720 is aldehyde C=O. But then, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, which is a para-substituted benzene. So, maybe the compound is an aldehyde attached to a benzene ring with some substituents.

But wait, the other signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d,3H), and 0.9 (t,3H). That looks like a chain. Let's see.

The 0.9 t is a triplet for 3H, so that's a terminal methyl group. The 1.7 m for 2H could be a CH₂ next to a CH. The 2.9 m for 1H could be a CH attached to something else, like a carbonyl. The 1.4 d for 3H suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, like a branch. So, putting this chain together: CH₂CH(CH₂CH3)CO- something?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a propanoyl group attached to the ring. Wait, perhaps the structure is something like (4-(sec-butyl)phenyl)propanal. Let me think: the aldehyde is on one end, and the propyl chain is attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, the branching: the 1.4 d (3H) is likely a methyl attached to a CH. So, perhaps the chain is (CH₂)CH(CH₂CH3). Hmm.

Wait, maybe the structure is an aldehyde group attached to a benzene ring, which itself is attached to a propyl chain. Let me try to sketch it.

The benzene ring is para-substituted with two groups. One is the aldehyde (RCHO), but that doesn't fit the NMR data because the aromatic protons would be split differently. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group and another group.

Wait, maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative with another substituent. Let's see: suppose the benzene has a substituent at position 1 and another at position 4. One substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, but that doesn't fit the aliphatic regions), but wait, perhaps it's a propionyl group attached as in RCO- attached to the benzene.

Wait, another approach: Let me try to build the structure from the NMR.

The aromatic region: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggests a 1,4-substituted benzene. So, the substituents are in the para positions.

Now, the substituents: one could be a carbonyl group, and the other an alkyl group. Let's suppose substituent A is at position 1 and substituent B at position 4.

Looking at the aliphatic region:

- 10.5 ppm (1H, broad): Could be a carbonyl group, perhaps a carboxylic acid. But wait, the IR has 1720 cm⁻¹, which would be more like an ester or aldehyde.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about each option and see if any of them fit the data.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, so the question is about the reaction product after treating Compound X with red phosphorus and HI. So, I need to figure out what X is, then determine what it becomes after this reaction.

But perhaps it's easier to work backward. Maybe the reaction is a type of substitution or hydrolysis. Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amide, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of a nitrile (RCN) to an amine (RCH₂NH₂) under certain conditions. No, that's usually done with LiAlH4. Alternatively, maybe it's the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. Wait, in acidic conditions, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids. But red phosphorus and HI are more likely used for the hydrolysis of acid chlorides to carboxylic acids. Oh wait, yes! I think that's it. Acid chlorides (RCOCl) when treated with H2O in the presence of red phosphorus and HI (a catalytic amount) undergo hydrolysis to form carboxylic acids. Because red phosphorus acts as a catalyst in this reaction.

So, if Compound X is an acid chloride, RCOCl, then treating it with red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyze it to the carboxylic acid RCOOH.

So, the product after the reaction would be a carboxylic acid. Looking at the options, which ones are acids? Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

Wait, what about the NMR of Compound X. Let's think: If X is an acid chloride, then the IR would show a strong C=O around 1800 cm⁻¹, but in the given data, it's 1720. Oh, but wait, maybe the IR data is after the reaction. No, wait, the question states that Compound X has those IR and NMR data, and reacts to give the product.

Wait, no, in the question, Compound X is the starting material. So, its IR and NMR are given, and after reaction, the product is one of the options. So, the product is the result of X being treated with red phosphorus and HI. So, if X is an acid chloride, then the product would be a carboxylic acid. So, looking for options that are carboxylic acids.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Option A is a propanoic acid derivative.

Wait, let's think about the structure of X. Let's suppose X is an acid chloride, RCOCl. Then the product would be RCOOH.

So, let's analyze the given data.

The IR of X shows a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Acid chlorides have C=O around 1800, but maybe in some cases, it can be lower. Hmm. Wait, maybe X isn't an acid chloride but an ester. Because esters have C=O around 1720 cm⁻¹. So if X is an ester, RCOOR', then treatment with red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyze the ester to a carboxylic acid. Wait, but I thought that with red phosphorus and HI, it's acid chlorides being hydrolyzed.

Alternatively, another possibility: maybe X is a nitrile. Nitriles have C≡N stretches around 2200-2250 cm⁻¹. But in the given IR, there's a peak at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which is a broad region, maybe for O-H or N-H. There's no peak around 2200, so perhaps X is not a nitrile.

Wait, the 10.5 ppm in the NMR is a broad singlet, which could be a carbonyl proton. If X is a ketone, the C=O is around 2100? No, wait, ketones don't have protons. So that can't be. Hmm.

Wait, maybe X is an aldehyde. Aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm. The 10.5 is a bit high, but possible. The IR would have a strong C=O around 1720, which matches an aldehyde. So, if X is an aldehyde, RCHO, then what would happen when it's treated with red phosphorus and HI? I'm not sure. I don't recall aldehydes reacting with red phosphorus and HI in a specific way. Maybe it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an acid chloride. Let me think: if X is an acid chloride, then its IR would have a strong C=O around 1800-1850 cm⁻¹. But in the data given, it's 1720, which is lower than that. Hmm. So maybe this isn't correct.

Wait, another thought: the IR shows a peak at 1720, which is in the range of esters. So if X is an ester, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyze the ester to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but I thought that acid chlorides react with red phosphorus and HI to form carboxylic acids. Esters usually hydrolyze under acidic or basic conditions, but I'm not sure about the role of red phosphorus and HI in that context.

Alternatively, maybe X isn't an acid chloride but a nitrile, but then where is the nitrile peak in the IR? There's nothing around 2200, so maybe it's not a nitrile.

Wait, perhaps I should analyze the given NMR data to find the structure of X.

Looking at the NMR signals:

- 10.5 ppm (broad, 1H): Maybe a carbonyl proton. Could be aldehyde or carboxylic acid, but more likely aldehyde because of the 1720 IR.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are para-substituted aromatic protons. Let's say the benzene ring has two substituents in the para positions. One substituent is the aldehyde group, but then the other substituent would be another group, perhaps an alkyl chain.

Wait, but the aldehyde group is attached to the benzene, making it a benzaldehyde derivative. Let's think: the structure would be benzaldehyde with another substituent, perhaps a propyl group leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, the aliphatic region has peaks at 2.9 (m,1H), 1.7 (m,2H), 1.4 (d,3H), and 0.9 (t,3H). That looks like an isopropyl group or something similar.

Wait, the 0.9 t suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group. Because the triplet at 0.9 with 3H is a terminal methyl. The 1.7 m (2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to another CH. The 2.9 m (1H) could be a CH attached to something else, like a carbonyl.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that is a propyl group attached to the benzene. So, the substituent would be something like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO, but wait, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl chain leading to a carbonyl group. For example, the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene, and the end of the propyl chain is a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde). But if X is a carbonyl-containing compound, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would determine the product.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's try to think of the options and see if any make sense.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would mean the acid is at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

If X was the corresponding acid chloride (4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride), then upon hydrolysis with red phosphorus and HI, it would become benzoic acid. So, the product would be option C.

But then, what about the NMR of X? If X is the acid chloride, the NMR would not show a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, as acid chlorides don't have protons on the carbonyl. The IR of X would show a C=O around 1800, which doesn't match the given data of 1720.

Hmm. So perhaps X isn't an acid chloride. Maybe it's an ester.

If X is an ester, RCOOR', then upon hydrolysis with red phosphorus and HI, it would form a carboxylic acid. So, if the product is option C, then X would be the corresponding ester, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate ester.

But looking at the NMR of X:

The 10.5 ppm could be from an aldehyde proton. But if X is an ester, why would there be an aldehyde proton? That doesn't fit. So maybe this isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile, but then where's the nitrile peak in the IR? There's nothing around 2200, so probably not.

Wait, another angle: The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is a CH2CH3 group. So, there's an ethyl group at the end of a chain.

The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which is part of a branching. So, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a propyl group, like -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-CO-something.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-(propanoyl)benzaldehyde. But then the aldehyde group would be in the para position with the propanoyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a carbonyl. For example, (phenyl)propanal with a substituent.

Wait, looking at the aliphatic NMR:

- 0.9 t (3H): terminal methyl, likely part of an ethyl group (CH2CH3).

- 1.7 m (2H): perhaps a CH2 next to a CH.

- 2.9 m (1H): a CH adjacent to a carbonyl.

- 1.4 d (3H): a methyl attached to a CH, like a branch.

So, putting it together: CH2CH(CH2CH3)-CO- something. Wait, that would be a branching with a propyl group.

So, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a propyl group attached to a carbonyl. For example, the substituent is -(CH2)2CH(CH2CH3)-CO-.

Wait, maybe the substituent is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CO-. So, the benzene ring has a substituent at position 4 which is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CO-. But what is the nature of this group? If it's a nitrile, then the IR would have shown the nitrile peak, which it doesn't.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group, CH2CH2CO-. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propanoyl group attached to the benzene ring. Let me think: the substituent is at position 4, and the benzene has another substituent, perhaps an aldehyde group.

Wait, but then the aldehyde would be at position 1, leading to the aromatic protons being split into two doublets, as in the NMR.

So, perhaps X is 4-(propanoyl)benzaldehyde. Then, upon treatment with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen? I'm not sure, but perhaps it would hydrolyze any ester groups or nitriles, but in this case, it's a benzaldehyde with a propionyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a carbonyl, making it a ketone. But then the H NMR wouldn't have an aldehyde proton.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to figure out the structure of X from the NMR and IR data.

The IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a carbonyl. So, either ester, ketone, aldehyde, acid, or acid chloride.

The NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm (1H, broad), which likely corresponds to a carbonyl proton. So, this suggests an aldehyde (since other carbonyl groups don't have protons attached). So, X is an aldehyde.

Wait, but then the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ is for the aldehyde's C=O, which is correct.

So, X is an aldehyde with a benzene ring. The structure could be something like benzaldehyde with a substituent.

Looking at the aliphatic NMR, there's a chain leading to a methyl group. So, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene, leading to the aldehyde.

Wait, no, the aldehyde is the substituent. So, the structure is probably a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions: one is an aldehyde group, and the other is a propyl branch.

Wait, but how would the aldehyde be attached? The aldehyde would be on the benzene as a substituent, and the other substituent would be a propyl group leading to another carbonyl? Or maybe the aldehyde is part of a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a propyl group attached to the benzene, with a ketone or aldehyde at the end.

Wait, maybe it's a cinnamaldehyde derivative, but that's probably not the case here.

Another approach: Let's look at the options for the product. The product comes from treating X with red phosphorus and HI. If X is a nitrile, then the product would be an amine. But the options don't seem to have amines. If X is an ester, the product would be a carboxylic acid. If X is an acid chloride, the product would be a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, options A and C are carboxylic acids. So, perhaps X is an ester or acid chloride.

But wait, if X is an ester, then treating with red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid. So, the product would be a carboxylic acid.

So, the product is either option A or C.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

Thus, X would be the corresponding ester or acid chloride.

If X is the ester, then the structure would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate ester. The ester would have the structure RCOOR', where R is the benzene group with substituents.

Wait, but then what's the structure of X.

But going back to X's NMR: The 10.5 ppm peak would have to be from something else if X is an ester. Because esters don't have protons on the carbonyl. So, that's a problem.

So, perhaps X is an acid chloride. Then, the product would be a carboxylic acid. But in X's IR, 1720 cm⁻¹ is lower than expected for an acid chloride. So that's conflicting.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps X is a ketone. The 1720 cm⁻¹ would fit for a ketone. But then, the 10.5 ppm peak wouldn't fit, because ketones don't have protons on the carbonyl.

So, this is confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently by looking at the options and see which one's structure could fit the NMR data of X.

Assume the product is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, X would have been the acid chloride, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride. Then, treating with red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyze it to the acid.

But then, the NMR of X would not have a peak at 10.5 ppm, because acid chlorides don't have protons on the carbonyl. So, this contradicts the data.

Alternatively, if X is an ester, which would be RCOOR', and upon hydrolysis gives RCOOH. Let's see, if the product is option C, then X would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate ester, like RCOOR'. Then, the NMR of X would have a peak for the ester's carbonyl, which is around 1720, matching the IR.

But then, the 10.5 ppm peak in the NMR of X would have to come from another group. But if X is an ester, where is that peak coming from?

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile that upon hydrolysis gives a carboxylic acid. So, X would be RCN, and upon hydrolysis with red phosphorus and HI, it becomes RCOOH.

If the product is option C, then X would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile. Let's see if that fits the NMR.

The NMR of X (the nitrile) would have a peak at around 10 ppm? Nitriles don't have protons, so the 10.5 ppm peak wouldn't come from anywhere. So that's conflicting.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR again.

The aromatic protons are in two doublets, suggesting a para-substituted benzene. So, substituents at positions 1 and 4.

If one substituent is a carbonyl group (like -CO-R), and the other is an alkyl group, then in the NMR, the aliphatic region would show the groups attached to the carbonyl.

Looking at the aliphatic signals:

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): terminal methyl, so perhaps a CH₂CH₂CH3 group.

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): a methyl attached to a CH.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): a CH₂ group.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a CH group.

So, putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene, and the chain is something like CH₂-CH(CH₂CH3)-CO-something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propanoyl group, like CH₂CH(CH₂CH3)CO- attached to the benzene.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a ketone or an aldehyde. If it's a ketone, then the IR would have a peak around 1720, which matches. The NMR would then have the aliphatic signals for the substituent.

But then, where does the 10.5 ppm peak come from? If it's a ketone, there's no proton. So, maybe that's an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group leading to an aldehyde. So, the structure would be CH₂CH(CH₂CH3)CHO attached to the benzene. But that's a bit long. Let's see.

In that case, the aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm. The IR would have a peak at 1720 for the aldehyde's C=O. The aliphatic chain would have the signals as described.

So, X would be 4-(propanal-2-yl)benzaldehyde? No, wait, perhaps it's 4-(propanal)benzaldehyde? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a ketone at the end. So, the substituent would be (CH₂)₂CO- attached to the benzene. But that would make it a ketone, which doesn't explain the 10.5 ppm peak.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a carbonyl in the middle. For example, the substituent is CH₂CH(CH₂CH3)COOH. No, but that would be a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to an aldehyde. So, the structure is (CH₂)₂CHCHO attached to the benzene. But that might not fit the NMR data.

Wait, let's count the protons:

The aliphatic region integrates to 1+2+3+3=9 H. The aromatic region is 4 H. The 10.5 is 1 H. So, total is 14 H. Let's see, if the molecule has a benzene ring (6 C), a substituent, and a chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene, and the chain ends in a carbonyl group. For example, the substituent is CH₂CH₂COCl (if it's an acid chloride). But then the NMR wouldn't have a peak at 10.5 ppm.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the number of signals.

The 1H NMR has 7 signals. So, likely a symmetrical structure but with some branching.

The substituent on the benzene is a group that leads to a branching in the chain.

Another approach: The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) suggests a CH2CH3 group. The doublet at 1.4 (3H) suggests a CH(CH3) group. The 1.7 (2H) could be a CH2 attached to a CH. The 2.9 (1H) could be a CH attached to a carbonyl.

So, the chain could be CH₂-CH(CH3)-CO-something.

Wait, that would be a structure like CH2-CH(CH3)-CO- attached to the benzene.

So, the substituent is CH2CH(CH3)CO-. But what's the functional group?

If it's a carbonyl, then X could be a ketone or an aldehyde. If it's an aldehyde, the 10.5 ppm peak is explained.

So, the substituent would be CH2CH(CH3)CHO attached to the benzene.

So, the structure would be p-[(CH2)CH(CH3)CHO]benzene.

But then, the IR would have a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ (aldehyde C=O), which fits.

The NMR would then show:

- Aldehyde proton at ~10 ppm (matches).

- The aromatic protons as two doublets (matches).

- The aliphatic chain: the CH2CH(CH3)CHO group.

Let's break down the aliphatic NMR:

The aldehyde proton is at 10.5 ppm (broad, 1H), correct.

The next group is CH2CH(CH3). The CH2 would be split into a quartet, but in the data, we have a triplet at 0.9 ppm (CH2CH3). Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe it's a different arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the chain is CH(CH2CH3)CH2CO-. So, the structure is benzaldehyde with a substituent CH(CH2CH3)CH2CO-something.

Wait, that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2CH(CH2CH3)CO-.

Wait, perhaps the chain is CH2CH(CH2CH3)COH? But that would be a secondary alcohol, which doesn't fit the IR.

Alternatively, maybe it's a propanoyl group attached to the benzene, leading to an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is (CH2)2CHCOOH, but then the IR would show a different pattern.

This is getting really complicated. Maybe I should try to see what each option's structure would look like and see if any match the data.

So, the options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Structure is a benzene ring with ethyl group and propanoic acid group at position 2 and 4?

Wait, no, 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would have the benzene ring with substituents at positions 2 and 4. The substituent at position 4 is ethyl, and at position 2 is a propanoic acid group.

But the NMR of X would need to show the substituents correctly.

But perhaps I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think again about the reaction.

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of acid chlorides. So, if X is an acid chloride, the product would be a carboxylic acid.

So, perhaps the correct option is C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Thus, X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride.

But then, the NMR of X would have the aliphatic region as follows:

The substituent is a sec-butyl group: CH(CH2CH3)2 attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So, the structure would be O=C-(C6H4)-CH(CH2CH3)2.

Wait, but the NMR of X would have the CH(CH2CH3)2 group. Let me see.

The CH(CH2CH3)2 group: the two methyl groups (CH3) attached to the same CH would be equivalent, so their signals would merge. The CH would be split into a multiplet, but in the NMR, for X, the aliphatic region would have a triplet around 0.9 ppm (from the terminal CH3 groups), and a quartet for the CH2 groups attached to the CH.

Wait, but in the given NMR data, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet (3H), which fits the CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which would fit a methyl attached to a CH.

Wait, but in the case of a sec-butyl group (CH(CH2CH3)2), the structure is:

CH2CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH(CH2CH3)2.

So, the substituent is CH(CH2CH3)2 attached to the carbonyl.

In that case, the NMR of X (the acid chloride) would show the following:

- The CH(CH2CH3)2 group would have the two CH2CH3 groups as triplets around 0.9 ppm, each integrating to 3H. But in the given data, the triplet is only 3H, so perhaps that's correct.

- The CH in the center would be a septet (due to coupling with the two adjacent CH2CH3 groups), but in the given data, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H, which doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a different group. Maybe it's a propyl group attached to a CH.

Wait, but this is getting too time-consuming, and I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should go with the conclusion that the product is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, because the reaction conditions suggest hydrolysis of an acid chloride to a carboxylic acid, and option C matches that.

The problem involves identifying the final product of the reaction between Compound X and red phosphorus with HI. The IR and NMR data of Compound X are provided, and the options for the product are given. The key steps to determine the solution are as follows:

1. **Reaction Analysis**: Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of acid chlorides to carboxylic acids. This suggests that if Compound X is an acid chloride, the reaction would yield a carboxylic acid.

2. **IR Data**: The IR spectrum of Compound X shows a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). This peak is consistent with an ester, acid chloride, or aldehyde. However, the absence of a peak around 1800 cm⁻¹ (expected for an acid chloride) makes it less likely that X is an acid chloride. The 1720 cm⁻¹ peak aligns more with an ester or aldehyde.

3. **NMR Data**: The NMR spectrum of Compound X includes a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm, which is highly deshielded and indicative of a carbonyl proton, such as an aldehyde or carboxylic acid. However, since the IR does not show strong evidence for an aldehyde (no peak around 2200 cm⁻¹ for C≡N), the 10.5 ppm peak is more likely from a carboxylic acid.

4. **Aromatic Protons**: The aromatic region of the NMR shows two doublets at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring. This suggests that the benzene ring has two substituents in the para positions.

5. **Aliphatic Region**: The aliphatic region of the NMR includes signals at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). These signals suggest a branching chain structure, likely a sec-butyl group.

6. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. This structure does not match the NMR data, as it would not produce the observed aliphatic signals.
   - **Option B**: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. This is an alkylbenzene and does not contain a carboxylic acid group, making it inconsistent with the reaction conditions.
   - **Option C**: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This structure matches the NMR data, as it includes a para-substituted benzene ring with a sec-butyl group and a carboxylic acid group. The aliphatic signals align with the sec-butyl group, and the 10.5 ppm peak corresponds to the carboxylic acid proton.
   - **Option D**: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. This is an alkylbenzene and does not contain a carboxylic acid group, making it inconsistent with the reaction conditions.

7. **Conclusion**: Based on the reaction conditions and the spectral data, the most likely product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to Option C.
