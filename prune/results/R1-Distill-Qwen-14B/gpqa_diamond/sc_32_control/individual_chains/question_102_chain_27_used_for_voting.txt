Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question about molecular biology and genetics, particularly involving gene expression constructs and some mouse models. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair initially found in neural crest cells, and the experiment they did to study their developmental fate. The setup involves some vectors and Cre/Lox systems, and then they're looking at expression in mice.

First, let's parse the details of the vector they created. It's a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two open reading frames (ORFs), so two genes are being expressed from one vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I remember that CBA is a strong promoter, often used to drive high levels of expression in various tissues. The receptor is preceded by an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, which I think is a way to have two genes expressed from a single mRNA. So, the mRNA would have the ligand ORF, then the IRES, then the receptor ORF.

They inserted stop signals with loxP and lox2272 cassettes. LoxP is a site recognized by Cre recombinase. The stop signals are in between the ligand and mCherry, and the receptor and eGFP. So in the vector, the setup is probably ligand-STOP-LOXP... then IRES... receptor-STOP-LOX2272. Or maybe the other way around? Wait, the ligand is at 5', so the vector would have: [CBA promoter] --> ligand ORF --> stop with loxP --> then IRES --> receptor ORF --> stop with lox2272. Then, the mCherry and eGFP are fused to each, but wait, the question says the ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, so maybe it's ligand-mCherry with a stop before it, and the receptor has a stop before eGFP?

Wait, the question says: 'the ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus.' Hmm, so perhaps the ligand is ligand-mCherry, and the receptor is receptor-eGFP.

But wait, the cassettes. So between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So without Cre, the stop would prevent expression of mCherry. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP, a stop in lox2272 cassette. So, when Cre is present, it would recombine the loxP sites, removing the stop, allowing expression.

So the idea is that in the absence of Cre, the ligand is not expressed because the stop is before mCherry, and the receptor is also not expressed because the stop is before eGFP. But when Cre is introduced, the loxP sites are recombined, removing the stops, so both ligand and receptor are expressed, each with their respective fluorescent proteins.

Wait, but wait, the vector is bicistronic, so maybe it's set up so that Cre is used to excise the stops in each of the ORFs. So for the ligand, when Cre is present, the stop is removed, so ligand is expressed with mCherry. Similarly, the receptor would have its stop removed, allowing receptor-eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but the vector is a lox-Cre vector. So perhaps Cre is used to control the expression. Alternatively, the vector may have the cassettes such that ligand and mCherry are under a single ORF, but with a stop, and the same for receptor and eGFP. So when Cre is introduced (like via a Cre-expressing cell type or mouse), it cuts out the lox sites, allowing the two ORFs to be expressed.

Wait, maybe each gene is in a separate cassette. So for ligand, it's ligand-ORF under CBA, followed by a stop with loxP. So under normal conditions, the ligand is expressed, then the stop prevents mCherry from being expressed. But in the presence of Cre, the loxP sites are cut, the stop is removed. Wait, no, the question says the ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, which suggests they're in the same reading frame. Hmm, maybe.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic, so each gene (ligand and receptor) is in its own ORF. Each is flanked by stop cassettes. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the stop after it prevents mCherry from being expressed. Similarly, the receptor ORF is followed by a stop, preventing eGFP. But with Cre, the stops are removed, so mCherry and eGFP are expressed.

I'm a bit confused about the setup. Alternatively, maybe the vector is designed so that when Cre is present, the ligand and receptor are co-expressed along with their fluorescent tags. But when Cre isn't present, the stops prevent expression of the fluorescent proteins.

Wait, the question says that the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is preceded by an IRES. So maybe the vector is set up as: [CBA promoter] -- ligand ORF -- stop (loxP) -- IRES -- receptor ORF -- stop (lox2272). Then, the mCherry is after ligand, and eGFP after receptor. So I'm probably getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps each is in a separate transcript.

Wait, bicistronic vectors typically have two ORFs in the same transcript, so the mRNA has both. So for the bicistronic construct, the mRNA would start at the CBA promoter, have the ligand ORF, then an IRES, then the receptor ORF. But in this case, each ORF is followed by a stop cassette.

Wait, no. The question says between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So perhaps the ligand ORF is first, then a stop, then mCherry, but the stop is flanked by loxP sites. So when Cre is present, it cuts the loxP sites and removes the stop, allowing transcription to continue into mCherry, thus expressing ligand-mCherry. For the receptor, it's similar: the ORF is followed by a stop in a lox2272 cassette, so when Cre is present, the stop is removed, and eGFP is expressed.

So, the idea is that in the presence of Cre, both ligand and receptor are expressed, with their respective fluorescent proteins. Without Cre, the stops prevent expression of the fluorescent proteins.

Now, the experiment: They transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and used Western blot with antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. They saw signals proportional to actin, meaning the blot is working. So the proteins are being expressed.

But then, they breed a mouse model that's homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then, they cross it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. So the offspring would be heterozygous for SOX10-Cre and homozygous for the construct.

SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So SOX10-Cre would express Cre under the control of SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells. So when the mouse is crossed with the construct, the Cre would be expressed in neural crest derivatives, leading to recombination in those cells.

After the offspring are born, they visualize under a confocal microscope. They used the antibodies against the proteins, but the question says they looked for the fluorescent signals. Wait, no, the Western blot was for the proteins, and the visualization under the microscope is for the fluorescent markers (probably eGFP and mCherry).

But the result is that they don't see a green signal. Wait, eGFP is green, mCherry is red. So the question is why they didn't see a green signal in the offspring.

Possible options:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. So they act on different cells. But that might not affect expression of the fluorescent proteins.

B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. So it's not on the cell surface, perhaps. If eGFP isn't expressed or not on membrane, then fluorescence wouldn't be seen.

C) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. But in the vector, the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is strong. The receptor is after IRES, which is probably sufficient. So maybe the enhancer is missing in the construct, so they aren't expressed.

D) the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That is, perhaps the stop cassette isn't correctly removed with the right reading frame, leading to a frameshift or no expression.

Wait, the vector has the receptor ORF followed by a stop in a lox2272 cassette. When Cre is introduced, it would remove the stop, allowing eGFP to be expressed in frame with the receptor. If the stop isn't correctly removed, or if the reading frame is wrong, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed properly.

In the experiment, they used SOX10-Cre, which is expressed in neural crest cells. So Cre would activate the expression of the receptor-eGFP and ligand-mCherry in neural crest cells.

But they don't see the green signal. So eGFP isn't expressed. Why?

Option D says that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So maybe when the stop is removed, the reading frame shifts, leading to a frameshift and eGFP not being expressed correctly. That could prevent the eGFP from being made, hence no green signal.

Alternatively, if the stop was not correctly removed, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But the Western blot showed that the proteins are expressed (since the signal is proportional to actin). Wait, the Western blot was done after transfecting the plasmid into astrocytes. So maybe the expression in the transfection worked, but in the mice, perhaps the Cre didn't remove the stop correctly.

Wait, the vector is in the mouse, so the Cre is from the SOX10-Cre mice. The construct is homozygous. So when they cross, the Cre would only be active in the cells where SOX10 is expressed, which is neural crest derivatives.

But the problem is that after crossing, they don't see the green signal. So maybe the eGFP isn't being expressed.

Option D would mean that the ORF is broken, so eGFP isn't made. Because lox2272 is a different site than loxP, perhaps? Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different Cre variants. The loxP is the original site, and lox2272 is a mutated version that can only be cut by Cre variants that recognize it, like Cre2 or something. But in this case, the question says that the vector uses loxP and lox2272, so Cre must recognize both.

Wait, standard Cre recognizes loxP. There are some variants, like Dre and others. Lox2272 is a lox variant that can only be cut by a modified Cre, like Cre2. But in this case, the mice express SOX10-Cre, which is wild-type Cre. So if the lox2272 site isn't cut, the stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Ah, that's a possibility. So for the receptor, the stop is flanked by lox2272. If the Cre used (from SOX10-Cre) doesn't cut lox2272, then the stop isn't removed, so eGFP isn't expressed. That would explain why there's no green signal.

Wait, but the question says that the ligand is under CBA promoter, and the IRES precedes the receptor. So in the mouse, without Cre, the ligand would be expressed but without mCherry, and the receptor would be expressed without eGFP. But with Cre, you would cut out the stops.

If the Cre can't cut lox2272, then the stop before eGFP remains, so the receptor isn't expressed. Wait, no, perhaps the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed regardless. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, let's think again. The vector is designed such that the ligand is under CBA, then a stop with loxP. Then IRES, then receptor, then stop with lox2272. Then, mCherry is after the ligand, and eGFP after the receptor.

Wait, maybe not. Oh, wait, the question says that the ligand ORF is 5' and fused to mCherry, with a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between them. Similarly, the receptor ORF is 3' and fused to eGFP, with a stop in lox2272 cassette between them.

So the setup is:

[CBA promoter] --> ligand ORF --> (loxP-stop-loxP) --> mCherry

[IRES] --> receptor ORF --> (lox2272-stop-lox2272) --> eGFP

Wait, but that doesn't make sense in terms of the vector's structure. Because in a bicistronic vector, you can't have two separate promoters. So perhaps the CBA promoter is driving the entire bicistronic transcript, which includes both the ligand and receptor ORFs.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

[CBA promoter] --> ligand ORF --> loxP-stop --> IRES --> receptor ORF --> lox2272-stop --> (something?)

But the way the question describes it is that ligand is at 5' fused to mCherry with a stop in loxP cassette between, and receptor is at 3' fused to eGFP with a stop in lox2272 cassette between.

Wait, perhaps each gene is in its own cassette.

So, the vector has two separate expression units: one for ligand-mCherry (with a loxP-stop cassette) and another for receptor-eGFP (with lox2272-stop cassette). Each is under their own promoter? No, it says the ligand is under CBA. The receptor is under IRES, which suggests it is part of the same bicistronic mRNA as the ligand.

Hmm, perhaps the vector is a single transcript with the ligand first, then IRES, then receptor. Each is followed by a stop cassette.

Wait, perhaps the vector is like this:

[ CBA promoter ] --> ligand ORF --> loxP-stop-loxP --> mCherry ORF

Then, after IRES, --> receptor ORF --> lox2272-stop-lox2272 --> eGFP ORF

But that would be two separate transcripts or two separate ORFs. Hmm, no, bicistronic implies one transcript with two ORFs.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

[ CBA promoter ] --> ligand ORF --> (stop with loxP) --> (IRES) --> receptor ORF --> (stop with lox2272)

But then, the mCherry is part of ligand ORF, and eGFP is part of receptor ORF. So the construct would be ligand-mCherry ORF, followed by IRES, followed by receptor-eGFP ORF.

But the stop cassettes would prevent the fluorescent proteins from being expressed unless Cre is present. So in the absence of Cre, ligand is expressed as ligand-mCherry without the stop, but wait no, the stop is between ligand and mCherry. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the stop after ligand prevents mCherry from being expressed. Similarly, the stop after receptor prevents eGFP from being expressed.

When Cre is present, it cuts the lox sites, removing the stops. So ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP are expressed.

But in the mouse, the Cre is SOX10-Cre, which is only active in neural crest cells. So in those cells, the stops are cut, and the proteins with fluorescent tags should be expressed.

In the experiment, they crossed the homozygous construct mice with SOX10-Cre mice, expecting that in the offspring, Cre would be active in neural crest cells, leading to expression of the receptor-eGFP and ligand-mCherry.

But they don't see a green signal. So the problem is that the eGFP isn't expressed.

Looking at the options:

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the same frame. So when the stop is removed, the reading frame shifts, leading to a nonfunctional or no protein. But that would require that the stop's removal causes a frameshift. Alternatively, if the stop's removal isn't done correctly (like the lox sites aren't recognized), then the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

Wait, if the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites, then the stops remain. So the eGFP isn't expressed. But the question says the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, which express wild-type Cre. Wild-type Cre only recognizes loxP sites, not lox2272. So the lox2272 site isn't cut, the stop remains, so the receptor's eGFP isn't expressed. That would explain why there's no green signal.

So in that case, the problem is that the Cre can't remove the stop before eGFP because it's flanked by lox2272, which Cre doesn't recognize. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed, leading to no green signal.

Looking at the options, option D talks about the frame, but perhaps the issue is that the stop isn't removed because Cre doesn't cut lox2272. None of the options directly address this, though.

Wait, the options are:

A) ligand and receptor are paracrine. Unrelated to expression.

B) receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. So it's expressed but not at membrane. But why would the Western blot show the protein, but not the fluorescence? Well, mCherry and eGFP are fluorescent proteins, but their localization matters. If the protein isn't on the surface, the fluorescence might be weak. But the question said they used SOX10-Cre, which is expressed in neural crest cells, which would presumably express the receptors on the cell surface. But in the question, they don't see any green signal. If the protein isn't expressed, there's no signal.

C) enhancer missing. But the construct uses CBA promoter for ligand and IRES for receptor. So unless the promoter isn't working, the enhancer might not be the issue. The Western blot showed that the proteins are expressed, so the promoters seem to be working.

D) frame issue. If the stop wasn't correctly removed, the reading frame shifts, so eGFP isn't expressed. But why? Because the stop is flanked by different lox sites.

Wait, but in the vector, the stop before eGFP is in lox2272. SOX10-Cre produces wild-type Cre, which only cuts loxP. So the lox2272 sites aren't cut, the stop remains. Thus, eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is that the Cre can't remove the stop because it's a lox2272 site.

But none of the options directly state that. The options given are A, B, C, D as above.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the stop wasn't correctly removed because the reading frame is wrong. If the loxP and lox2272 sites are not properly aligned, the removal might not happen correctly, leading to a frameshift. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has the eGFP after the receptor, but the stop is in between. So when Cre is introduced, it excises the stop, but maybe the reading frame is wrong because the excision leaves a frame shift. So the eGFP isn't in frame, leading to no expression. That would be option D.

But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the lox2272 isn't compatible with Cre, so the stop isn't removed, leading to no eGFP expression. But since the options don't include that, perhaps the correct answer is D, that the frame is incorrect. Or maybe option C, but I don't think so.

Wait, the problem is that the eGFP isn't being expressed. So the reason could be that the Cre isn't removing the stop because it doesn't recognize the lox2272 sites. Thus, the stop remains, preventing eGFP from being expressed.

But in this case, the options don't directly address that. So perhaps the correct answer is D, that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, the vector has the ligand and receptor as two separate ORFs. Each is followed by a stop cassette. The stop before ligand's mCherry is in loxP, and the stop before receptor's eGFP is in lox2272.

In the presence of Cre, the loxP sites are cut, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But for the receptor, the lox2272 sites aren't cut by wild-type Cre, so the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites.

But the options don't have that as a choice. The options are A to D as given.

Looking back, the options:

A) Ligand and receptor are paracrine: So ligand is secreted and acts on other cells. But that doesn't explain why the eGFP isn't expressed.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi: So it's made but not on the surface. But Western blot would show the protein. The question says that the blot showed signals proportional to actin, but maybe that's in the transfection, not the mouse.

Wait, the Western blot was done after transfecting the plasmid into astrocytes. So the expression in the transfected cells worked, but in the mouse, where Cre is present (SOX10-Cre), the eGFP isn't expressed.

So the problem is in the mouse's expression. So why would the eGFP not be expressed? Because the stop isn't removed.

But the stop isn't removed because Cre can't cut lox2272. So the eGFP remains under the stop. Thus, no green signal.

But the options don't address this. So perhaps the answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct was designed with the loxP and lox2272 in a way that when Cre is introduced, the frame shifts. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is such that the receptor-eGFP is under a stop that isn't excised because the lox sites are wrong, but I'm not seeing that as an option.

Hmm, maybe the answer is D, because the stop is flanked by lox2272, which isn't cut by Cre, so the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed. But the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP isn't correctly in frame, leading to no expression. So the answer would be D.

Alternatively, considering that SOX10-Cre is active in neural crest, if the vectors are not activated, the eGFP isn't expressed. But why wouldn't the vector activate? Because the Cre isn't recognizing the sites, so the stops remain.

But the options don't have that. So the options are limited.

Wait, another thought: in the vector, the IRES comes after the ligand ORF. IRES allows internal initiation, so the receptor ORF can be expressed without the ligand's stop affecting it. But the receptor is followed by a stop. So in the absence of Cre, the receptor's ORF is expressed, but the eGFP isn't. Because the stop is in place.

But when Cre is present, it should remove the stop, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

But if the Cre can't remove the stop (because it's lox2272), then the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is that the Cre can't cut the stop's lox sites.

But among the options, the only one that relates to the expression of the eGFP is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector was designed with the stops in such a way that even after Cre excision, the eGFP isn't in frame, leading to no expression.

So, given the options, I think the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Because without proper frame alignment, the eGFP isn't expressed.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair, where the ligand is fused to mCherry and the receptor to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is preceded by an IRES element. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor ORF and eGFP, there is a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. The experiment involves crossing mice homozygous for this construct with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice, which express Cre under the SOX10 promoter in neural crest cells. However, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under the confocal microscope.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Vector Design**: The vector is bicistronic, meaning it contains two ORFs in a single transcript. The ligand ORF is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor ORF is preceded by an IRES element. Each ORF is flanked by a stop cassette: the ligand ORF has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor ORF has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. In the absence of Cre, these stops prevent the expression of mCherry and eGFP. In the presence of Cre, the stops should be excised, allowing expression of the fluorescent proteins.

2. **Cre Activity**: SOX10-Cre mice express wild-type Cre, which specifically recognizes and excises loxP sites but not lox2272 sites. This means that while the stop cassette flanking the ligand ORF (loxP) can be excised, the stop cassette flanking the receptor ORF (lox2272) cannot be excised by wild-type Cre. As a result, the stop remains in place, preventing the expression of eGFP.

3. **Observed Outcome**: After crossing the mice, no green signal (eGFP) is observed. This indicates that the eGFP is not being expressed. The issue lies in the inability of wild-type Cre to excise the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette, leaving the stop intact and preventing eGFP expression.

4. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:
   - **(A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**: This refers to the functional interaction between the ligand and receptor but does not explain the lack of eGFP expression. This option is incorrect.
   - **(B) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**: If the receptor-eGFP were properly expressed, it would still be detectable via Western blot or fluorescence. Since no green signal is observed, this is unlikely to be the issue. This option is incorrect.
   - **(C) The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**: The construct uses a strong promoter (CBA) for the ligand and an IRES for the receptor, which should ensure sufficient expression. The lack of eGFP expression is not due to missing enhancers. This option is incorrect.
   - **(D) The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**: If the stop cassette flanking the receptor ORF were not excised, the eGFP would not be expressed. While this option does not explicitly address the lox2272 issue, it aligns with the observed lack of eGFP expression. This is the most plausible answer based on the given options.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation for the lack of a green signal is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame, preventing eGFP expression. This aligns with the observation that the stop cassette flanking the receptor ORF (lox2272) cannot be excised by wild-type Cre, leaving the stop intact and preventing eGFP expression.

Answer: D
