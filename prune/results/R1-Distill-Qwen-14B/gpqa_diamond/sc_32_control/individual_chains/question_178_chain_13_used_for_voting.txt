Okay, so I've got this Lagrangian here: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And I'm supposed to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the renormalizability depends on the dimensions of the coupling constants.

Wait, the sigma matrix σ_{μν} is given as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. Oh right, that's the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. So σ_{μν} would have dimensions related to the gamma matrices. But gamma matrices themselves are dimensionless, right? Because in four spacetime dimensions, the Dirac matrices are treated as dimensionless. So σ_{μν} would also be dimensionless.

Now, let's think about the fields. The field ψ is a spinor, so it has a mass dimension. In four dimensions, the Dirac spinor ψ has a mass dimension of 3/2. Because the action is dimensionless, and the kinetic term is ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which must have dimension 4. So each ψ contributes 3/2, so ψ̄ i γ ∂ ψ would be 3/2 + 1 (from ∂_μ, which is dimension 1) times 2 (since two spinors), wait no, wait: ψ̄ is like ψ^† γ^0, which has the same dimension as ψ, so each ψ is 3/2. So ψ̄ ψ would be 3. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1. So for the kinetic term, each term ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ: 3/2 + 3/2 + 1 = 5? Wait that can't be right. Oh wait, no: the term is ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ. The dimensions: ψ̄ is 3/2, i γ^mu is dimensionless, ∂_mu is dimension 1, and ψ is 3/2. So adding up: 3/2 (ψ̄) + 1 (from ∂) + 3/2 (ψ) = 3/2 + 3/2 + 1 = 4. So the whole term has dimension 4. That makes sense because the Lagrangian is dimension 4 in four dimensions.

So back to the interaction term: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{mu nu}.

Each ψ is 3/2, and σ is dimensionless, so ψ̄ σ ψ is 3/2 + 3/2 = 3.

What about F^{mu nu}? F is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism or something similar. F is defined as ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. So each derivative is dimension 1, and A is a vector potential, which in four dimensions has dimension 1, since the field strength F has dimension 2 (because F is ∂ A, so 1 + 1=2). So F^{mu nu} has mass dimension 2.

So putting it all together, the term is κ multiplied by (ψ̄ σ ψ) which is dimension 3, multiplied by F which is dimension 2. So the whole term has dimension 3 + 2 =5, plus the dimension from κ. But since the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4, the sum of the dimensions of all the terms in L must be 4.

So the equation is [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ] + [F] = 4.

Which is [κ] + 3 + 2 =4 → [κ] = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, the next part: is the theory renormalizable? Well, a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have positive mass dimension. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Wait, the mass dimension of the coupling constants determines whether the interaction is renormalizable. The general rule is that a coupling with mass dimension ≤4 is renormalizable. Wait, no, more accurately, the dimension of the coupling tells us the superficial degree of divergence. For a term to be renormalizable, the coupling's dimension must be at least as negative as (4 - (sum of fields' dimensions)). Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the superficial degree of divergence.

But another approach: in a renormalizable theory, the coupling constant has a mass dimension such that the interaction term has a dimension ≤4. Because the Lagrangian must be dimension 4, so each term in L must have dimension ≤4. But wait, in this case, our interaction term is part of the Lagrangian, so it must have dimension 4. Wait, no, wait: the interaction Lagrangian term must have dimension 4 because the entire Lagrangian is density, which is dimension 4 in four-dimensional spacetime. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

Wait, no, actually, each term in the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4, because the Lagrangian is integrated over four dimensions (d^4 x), which is dimensionless (since x has dimension -4, because [x] = -1 per dimension). So the Lagrangian density must be dimensionless? No, no, wait: no, that's not correct. The action is dimensionless because it's the integral of the Lagrangian density, which has dimension [Lagrangian density] =4, integrated over d^4x (which has dimension -4). So the total action [S]=0. Therefore, the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the term in question is L_int = κ [ψ̄ σ ψ F]. So we found that [κ] is -1, and the product of fields in the term has dimension 3 + 2=5. So the term is [κ] +5 =4 → -1 +5=4 → yes, correct.

But renormalizability is determined by the mass dimension of the coupling. The coupling is κ, which has dimension -1. Now, the rule is that a coupling with negative mass dimension implies that the interaction is non-renormalizable. Wait, wait, no—wait, if a coupling has positive mass dimension, it is super-renormalizable. If it has negative mass dimension, it's non-renormalizable. Because for a term like g φ^n, the mass dimension of g is [g] = d - n*(mass dimension of φ). For a scalar theory, let's say φ has dimension (d/2 -1). So for φ^4 in 4d, [φ] = (4/2 -1)=1. [g] =4 -4*1=0. So g is dimensionless, which is renormalizable.

In our case, [κ]=-1, which is negative. So the theory is non-renormalizable. Because couplings with negative mass dimension lead to terms that have higher dimension, meaning that the interaction is of higher order and requires an infinite number of counterterms, making the theory non-renormalizable.

So putting it together: κ has dimension -1. The theory is not renormalizable. Looking at the options:

Option C says [κ]=-1 and theory not renormalizable. Option A says [κ]=-1 and renormalizable. So the correct choice is C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \(\kappa\) and assess the renormalizability of the theory, we analyze the interaction Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \(\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]\), \(\psi\) is a Dirac spinor, and \(F^{\mu\nu}\) is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The Dirac spinor \(\psi\) has mass dimension \([ \psi ]_M = \frac{3}{2}\) in four spacetime dimensions.
- The field strength tensor \(F^{\mu\nu}\) is constructed from derivatives of the gauge field \(A_\mu\), and since \([A_\mu]_M = 1\), it follows that \([F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2\).

### Step 2: Mass dimension of \(\kappa\)
The interaction term \(\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}\) must have mass dimension 4 because the Lagrangian density is dimensionless in natural units (\(c = \hbar = 1\)) and is integrated over four-dimensional spacetime. Breaking down the term:
- \(\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi\) has mass dimension \([ \bar{\psi} ]_M + [ \psi ]_M = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3\), since \(\sigma_{\mu\nu}\) is dimensionless.
- \(F^{\mu\nu}\) has mass dimension 2.

Thus, the total dimension of the interaction term is:
\[
[ \kappa ]_M + [ \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi ]_M + [ F^{\mu\nu} ]_M = 4.
\]
Substituting the known dimensions:
\[
[ \kappa ]_M + 3 + 2 = 4 \implies [ \kappa ]_M = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. If a coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the interaction term is non-renormalizable, as it introduces high-energy divergences that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms.

In this case, the coupling constant \(\kappa\) has mass dimension \(-1\), which is negative. Therefore, the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Step 4: Evaluating the options
- **Option A**: \([ \kappa ]_M = -1\), theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the theory is not renormalizable.
- **Option B**: \([ \kappa ]_M = 1\), theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the mass dimension of \(\kappa\) is not 1.
- **Option C**: \([ \kappa ]_M = -1\), theory is not renormalizable. **Correct**, as derived above.
- **Option D**: \([ \kappa ]_M = 1\), theory is not renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the mass dimension of \(\kappa\) is not 1.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
