Okay, so I've got this question here about a scientific experiment involving ligand-receptor pairs and some genetic constructs. Hmm, let's try to break it down.

First, the setup: a new ligand-receptor pair is identified in neural crest cells. They want to study their developmental fate. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with certain structuresâ€”eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets making a binding site. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices. 

Then, the construct they made is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two coding regions, right? The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and before the receptor, there's an IRES element. 

Wait, I remember that IRES allows internal ribosome entry, which is used to have two separate proteins expressed from a single mRNA. So the ligand and receptor would be co-expressed but as separate proteins. 

Between the ligand and mCherry, there's a stop cassette with loxP. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a stop with lox2272. Oh, right, these are site-specific recombination sites. So if Cre is present, it would recombine and remove the stop cassettes, allowing the fusion proteins to be expressed.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and did a Western blot. The blot showed signals proportional to actin loading, so that part worked. Then they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct, on a wild-type background. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, and Cre would be expressed under its control.

After the mice are born, they visualize under confocal. No green signal. The eGFP is part of the receptor construct; so they expected green fluorescence if the receptor-eGFP was expressed and functional.

The question is why there's no green signal. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But if that's the case, would the eGFP not be expressed? Or maybe the construct isn't expressed because of the expression setup. Wait, the ligand is under CBA promoter. I think CBA is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. Receptor is under IRES, which is after the ligand. So both should be expressed when the construct is active.

But when they made the mouse model, they're using a bicistronic vector, and when Cre is present (like in the SOX10-Cre mice), the loxP and lox2272 sites would recombine, removing the stop cassettes. So the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP fusions should be made. But in the offspring, why no green?

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. That would prevent them from being expressed on the cell surface. If the eGFP isn't on the surface, fluorescence wouldn't be seen. But the Western blot would still show the protein, right? Because the blot is for total proteins. So maybe the eGFP is present but not at the cell surface. But the question says the Western blot was successful, so maybe the protein is being made but not properly trafficking. But in that case, would the blot show eGFP? Or would they detect it via another antibody? Wait, the question says the antibodies are against the overexpressed proteins. So if eGFP is part of the construct, perhaps they don't have an antibody for eGFP? Or maybe the Western blot was for the ligand and receptor, not the fluorescent proteins. Hmm, the question says the Western blot was after plasmid transfection and they saw signals proportional to actin loading. So perhaps the eGFP and mCherry are not detected on the blot. So maybe the issue is that the eGFP isn't expressed, or the construct isn't functional.

Option C: Enhancer missing. The enhancer would be required for the expression of the ligand and receptor. But the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. I think CBA doesn't necessarily require enhancers for expression. The IRES is just for the receptor. So maybe this option is less likely. Unless the CBA promoter isn't sufficient in the cells where Cre is active.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. The eGFP is at the C-terminus of the receptor. If the stop cassette wasn't removed properly, the receptor might not be expressed as a fusion with eGFP. So if the stop is intact, the receptor would be expressed but without eGFP. Or if the stop is in the wrong place, maybe the frame is wrong. Wait, but the construct uses loxP and lox2272, which are different recombinase recognition sites. The stop cassette between ligand and mCherry has loxP, and the stop between receptor and eGFP has lox2272. So when Cre (which recognizes loxP) is used, the loxP sites would recombine and remove the stop, allowing ligand-mCherry to be expressed. But lox2272 is a different site, which requires a different recombinase, like Dre. Oh wait, but the question says they used a Cre vector. So the lox2272 sites wouldn't be recombined by Cre. Oh! Because Cre only recognizes loxP sites. So the stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP is flanked by lox2272 sites, which Cre can't cut. Therefore, the stop remains, and the receptor would be expressed but without the eGFP. Hence, when they look for green fluorescence, there's none because the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the Western blot was done after plasmid transfection, so perhaps in that case, the stop was removed? Or maybe the plasmid isn't the same as the mouse construct. Wait, the mouse construct is the one that's homozygous, and when they crossed it with SOX10-Cre, which is a Cre line. So in the offspring, the Cre is active. So in the mouse, the loxP sites are recombined by Cre, but the lox2272 sites are not. So the ligand-mCherry would be expressed, but the receptor-eGFP would not be, because the stop remains. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed, so no green fluorescence.

But wait, the bicistronic vector is designed such that after Cre recombination, both ORFs are expressed. So the ligand would be expressed as a fusion with mCherry, and the receptor as a fusion with eGFP. But if only the loxP sites are cut, and the lox2272 remain, then the receptor's stop remains, so the receptor doesn't get fused with eGFP. So the eGFP isn't expressed. So when they look for green, there's nothing.

So in the mouse, only the ligand-mCherry is expressed, and the receptor isn't fused to eGFP. So the eGFP wouldn't be present, leading to no green signal. That makes sense.

So the correct answer would be D) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame. Wait, no, why D? Because in the construct, the stop is between receptor ORF and eGFP. So without recombination, the receptor's C-terminus is the stop. So if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. But the question is why the eGFP isn't expressed in the mouse.

Wait, the vector has the ligand under CBA, then IRES. Then the receptor is under IRES, but with a stop after it before eGFP. So after Cre recombinase acts, the stop between ligand and mCherry is removed (since it's loxP), so ligand-mCherry is expressed. The stop after receptor is lox2272, which Cre can't cut, so the stop remains. Therefore, the receptor is expressed as a separate protein, but the eGFP isn't. So the eGFP isn't produced. Therefore, the issue is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop before it isn't removed. So the eGFP hasn't been expressed.

But the options don't directly say that. Let me look again.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Hmm. If the stop isn't removed, the receptor is expressed as a full-length protein, but without the eGFP. So the eGFP isn't made. But that's about expression, not frame.

Alternatively, maybe the construct isn't correctly designed. For example, perhaps the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor ORF. So when the stop is removed, if the frame is wrong, the eGFP might not be correctly translated.

Wait, the stop between the receptor and eGFP is a lox2272 cassette. If that stop isn't removed, the receptor is expressed as a full-length, but without eGFP. So in the mouse, after Cre (which only removes loxP), the eGFP stop remains. So the eGFP isn't expressed. The Western blot would show the receptor without eGFP, but in the experiment, they only saw mCherry (maybe) but not eGFP.

But the question says, after transfecting the plasmid, they ran a Western blot and saw signals proportional to actin. So perhaps in the plasmid transfection, the construct isn't in the same configuration as the mouse. Or perhaps Cre isn't active in the primary astrocyte culture.

Wait, after plasmid transfection, they might not have much Cre activity, so the stop cassettes are still present. But the Western blot showed signals, which suggests that the ligand and receptor are expressed. How?

Wait, the ligand is under CBA promoter. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand would be expressed without mCherry (since the stop is in between ligand and mCherry, which is under loxP). So in the vector without Cre, the ligand is expressed, and the receptor is under IRES and also has a stop before eGFP (lox2272). So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the receptor is not. Wait, no: the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed as a separate protein. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand would be expressed as a full ORF, and the receptor as well, but without eGFP. Because the eGFP is after a stop that Cre would remove.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think again.

The construct is ligand (CBA promoter) -> stop (loxP) -> mCherry.

Then, IRES -> receptor (ORF) -> stop (lox2272) -> eGFP.

So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the mCherry isn't because the stop is in place. The receptor would be expressed because the IRES allows it, but the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the stop is in place.

In the presence of Cre (like in the mouse crossed with SOX10-Cre), the loxP sites are cut, removing the stops. So ligand-mCherry would be expressed as a fusion, and the lox2272 stop would also be cut? Wait, no. Only loxP is cut by Cre. Lox2272 requires a different recombinase.

So in the presence of Cre, the ligand-mCherry fusion is made, but the eGFP stop remains because Cre can't cut lox2272. So the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't. Therefore, the eGFP is not expressed, so no green fluorescence.

But wait, the question says that they used the same construct in the mouse. So the mouse has the same setup. When they cross with SOX10-Cre, which is a Cre line, the loxP sites in the construct would be cut. So the ligand-mCherry is expressed. The receptor ORF is expressed, but the eGFP isn't because the stop remains.

So the eGFP isn't expressed, so no green signal. But why is this the case? Because the stop in the lox2272 cassette wasn't removed. But the question asks why they don't see green.

So the problem is that the eGFP isn't being expressed, which is because the stop between receptor and eGFP isn't removed. But the options don't directly state that. So looking at the options:

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that when the stop is removed, the reading frame is off, making eGFP not part of the same protein. But in this case, the stop isn't removed at all, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So perhaps the stop isn't removed due to the wrong recombinase. So the reason for no eGFP is because the stop wasn't cut, which is because the construct uses lox2272, which Cre can't cut.

Wait, but the option D is about the frame, not about the presence or absence of the stop. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector isn't designed correctly. For example, the eGFP isn't in the same reading frame as the receptor. So even if the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't correctly appended.

But in this case, the stop wasn't removed because Cre can't cut lox2272. So the eGFP isn't expressed at all. Therefore, the correct answer is likely option D, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop wasn't removed, but none of the options directly state that.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. That would mean that they act on other cells, but that doesn't directly explain why the eGFP isn't expressed.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. That would affect localization but not expression. Western blot would still show the protein.

C) Enhancer for expression missing. If the promoter isn't working, but the ligand is under CBA, which should be strong.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame. That would prevent fusion, but if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't made. So perhaps the frame isn't the issue here.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. If the stop is in the lox2272 cassette, which Cre can't remove, then the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is that the stop remains, leading to no eGFP. But none of the options talk about the presence of the stop. Instead, option D is about not being in frame.

Alternatively, perhaps in the construct, the eGFP is placed after the lox2272 stop. So when Cre is introduced, which only cuts loxP, the lox2272 stop remains, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So the construct is designed so that Cre can only remove the stop for the ligand-mCherry, but not the receptor-eGFP.

Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed. So why would that happen? Because the stop is still there, preventing eGFP expression. But how does that tie into the answer options?

Looking at the options again, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop was removed (which it isn't), but the frame is wrong, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed correctly. But in this scenario, the stop isn't removed, so eGFP isn't even started.

Therefore, the problem is that the stop isn't removed because the recombinase can't recognize the lox2272 sites. So the eGFP isn't expressed. But none of the options directly address this. So perhaps the correct answer is option D. Or maybe another option.

Wait, another thought: the IRES is an internal ribosome entry site, which allows the receptor to be translated after the ligand. But in the presence of Cre, both ligand and receptor would be expressed. But if only the loxP stops are removed, the ligand-mCherry is expressed, but the receptor's eGFP isn't. So the construct allows for co-expression of ligand and receptor. But in the mouse, only the ligand is expressed with mCherry, and the receptor is expressed without eGFP.

Wait, but the Western blot after plasmid transfection showed signals proportional to actin. So during the plasmid transfection, perhaps the construct is expressed without the stops. Because in the plasmid, maybe the loxP and lox2272 are present but Cre isn't active. So without Cre, the stops are in place. So the ligand is expressed, but without mCherry. The receptor is expressed, but without eGFP. But the Western blot shows actin-proportional signals, suggesting both proteins are expressed. Hmm, but if the stops are in place, then the proteins would be expressed but not the fusion proteins. So perhaps the Western blot detected the native ligand and receptor.

Wait, maybe the Western blot detected the overexpressed native proteins, not the fusion proteins. So in the plasmid, the ligand and receptor are expressed with the stops, so they are expressed as native proteins, detectable by their own antibodies. But in the mouse, when Cre is present, the ligand-mCherry is expressed. The receptor is expressed, but without eGFP. So when they look for eGFP fluorescence, there's none.

But the real issue is why the eGFP isn't expressed. It's because the stop between receptor and eGFP isn't removed. But the options don't directly say that; the closest is option D, which is about the frame.

Wait, perhaps the fusion is not in frame. Like, the eGFP is placed after the receptor, but in a different reading frame, so when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't correctly translated. But in this case, the stop hasn't been removed, so the eGFP isn't even started. So the problem is that the stop isn't removed.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct has the eGFP in the same frame as the receptor, but the stop isn't removed, so it's not expressed. But the options don't directly address this. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, no. Another angle: the construct uses IRES for the receptor. IRES allows for the expression of the receptor as a separate protein. So if the stop is in place, the receptor is expressed as a normal protein, but without eGFP. So no eGFP.

Which leads me to think that the problem is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. So which option aligns with that? Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, which would cause the eGFP not to be expressed. But if the stop is still present, the eGFP isn't even initiated. So the actual reason is that the stop isn't removed, but the options don't directly mention that. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is D because without the stop being removed, the eGFP isn't in frame (even though in reality, it's not expressed at all).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is not in the correct frame, making it not expressed. So when the stop is removed, the frame is wrong, so eGFP isn't made. But that doesn't fit with the scenario because the stop wasn't removed in the first place.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to outline the possible reasons:

1. The eGFP wasn't expressed because the stop wasn't removed (lox2272 isn't cut by Cre). So eGFP isn't expressed.
2. The eGFP is in the wrong frame, hence not expressed.

Option D says the frame is wrong, so eGFP isn't expressed. If the frame is wrong, the eGFP wouldn't be synthesized even if the stop is removed. But in this case, the stop isn't removed. So the real reason is the stop wasn't removed.

But none of the options mention lox2272 or Cre's inability to cut it. So the only plausible option is D, which suggests that the eGFP isn't properly fused, perhaps due to frame issues. Alternatively, the stop remains because the lox2272 isn't recombined.

Wait, maybe the mouse construct was designed with the lox2272 sites, which require a different recombinase. Since they're using Cre, which doesn't recognize lox2272, the stop isn't removed. Hence, eGFP isn't expressed. But the options don't directly address this. So among the given options, the best fit is D.

Wait, another option: perhaps the eGFP is not expressed because the stop isn't removed, making it so the eGFP isn't expressed. So the reason is that the stop remains, but the option that would explain this is D, which is about the frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not expressed because the vector didn't undergo recombination. But that's not any of the options.

I think the correct answer must be D. The receptor and eGFP are not in frame, so even if the stop was removed, the eGFP wouldn't be correctly expressed. But in reality, the stop isn't removed, so eGFP isn't even expressed.

Wait, but the stop isn't removed because Cre can't cut lox2272. So the eGFP isn't expressed, but that's not any of the options except perhaps D.

Alternatively, maybe the mouse model is homozygous, and the bicistronic construct isn't working correctly because of the lox sites. But perhaps the problem is that the two stops (loxP and lox2272) aren't being removed together. So only the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't. But the question said the Western blot showed expression, so perhaps the receptor is expressed without eGFP.

Wait, I'm getting a bit lost here. Let me try to sum up.

The likely reason for no green signal is that the eGFP isn't expressed. The eGFP isn't expressed because the stop in its cassette (lox2272) isn't removed by Cre. So when the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre, which only uses Cre (loxP), the eGFP stop remains. So the eGFP isn't expressed. The only option that somewhat relates is D, but D is about the frame, not the stop. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in a different frame, making it impossible to express even if the stop is removed. So even if the stop is gone, the eGFP isn't in frame, leading to no eGFP. But in this case, the stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

But since the options don't directly address the stop, I think the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, leading to no eGFP expression.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand-receptor pair in neural crest cells. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. The construct includes stop cassettes flanked by loxP and lox2272 sites, which are designed to be removed by Cre recombinase to allow co-expression of the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP fusion proteins. After crossing the mouse model with SOX10-Cre mice, no green fluorescence (eGFP) was observed under confocal microscopy. The task is to determine the most likely reason for this outcome.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Construct Design**:
   - The ligand is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry, with a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between the ligand and mCherry.
   - The receptor is at the 3' position, fused to eGFP, with a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette between the receptor and eGFP.
   - Cre recombinase removes loxP sites but cannot remove lox2272 sites, as they require a different recombinase (Dre).

2. **Expression in the Mouse Model**:
   - In the presence of Cre (from SOX10-Cre mice), the loxP-stop-loxP cassette is removed, allowing the ligand-mCherry fusion to be expressed.
   - The lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette remains intact because Cre cannot recognize lox2272 sites. This prevents the receptor-eGFP fusion from being expressed.

3. **Western Blot Results**:
   - After plasmid transfection, the Western blot showed signals proportional to actin loading, indicating that the ligand and receptor were expressed. However, this was likely due to the expression of the native ligand and receptor proteins, not the fusion proteins (mCherry or eGFP), as the stops were still in place during the transfection.

4. **No Green Fluorescence**:
   - The absence of green fluorescence indicates that the eGFP was not expressed. This is because the stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP (lox2272-stop-lox2272) was not removed by Cre, preventing eGFP expression.

5. **Option Analysis**:
   - **(A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**: This does not explain the lack of eGFP expression, as the issue lies in the construct design and expression, not the functional relationship between the ligand and receptor.
   - **(B) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**: This would affect localization but not expression. The Western blot would still detect the receptor-eGFP protein, which was not observed.
   - **(C) The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**: The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, which does not require an enhancer for expression. This option is unlikely.
   - **(D) The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**: If the receptor and eGFP were not in the same reading frame, the eGFP would not be expressed even if the stop were removed. However, the primary issue here is that the stop was not removed due to the inability of Cre to recognize lox2272 sites. While this option is plausible, it does not fully capture the root cause, which is the lack of recombination at the lox2272 sites.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct frame, preventing their expression as a fusion protein. This aligns with option D, even though the primary issue is the lack of recombination at the lox2272 sites. Among the given options, D is the best fit.

Answer: D
