Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying the product of a reaction involving Compound X. The compound undergoes a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of an acid chloride to form an acid. So maybe Compound X has an acid chloride group.

Let me look at the spectral data given for Compound X. The IR and NMR data should give me information about the structure.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks mentioned are 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H stretching, maybe in an acid or an alcohol. Wait, but in an acid, the O-H stretch is usually broader and around 2500-3300. The strong peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, likely a ketone or an acid chloride. Acid chlorides have strong absorption around 1760-1800 cm-1. But 1720 is a bit lower. Hmm. Could it be an ester? Esters have carbonyls around 1740-1700. Alternatively, maybe a ketone, but then what about the other peaks?

Wait, there's a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So, the compound has an aromatic ring. So, putting this together: an aromatic ring with carbonyl and O-H groups? Or maybe the O-H is from an alcohol or another group.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR shows peaks at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), which is a broad singlet. That's probably an O-H proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Wait, but wait—if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would typically be broad, but sometimes it can be a singlet if there's no splitting. Then 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because the two doublets each have 2H, which fits a para-disubstituted benzene. So, like two substituents opposite each other on the benzene ring.

The other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which might be a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl or something. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), perhaps another set of methylene groups. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to something, maybe as a substituent. 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, like a CH2CH2CH3 structure.

Putting all this together, maybe the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent that has a carbonyl group and an O-H group. Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. If the O-H is from a carboxylic acid, that would fit. So perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, but wait, in the reaction, Compound X is treated with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that when a carboxylic acid chloride reacts with HI, it would produce a carboxylic acid and HCl. But red phosphorus is used in the hydrolysis of acid chlorides to acids. So, if X is an acid chloride, the product would be the corresponding acid.

So, let's look at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That would be a benzene ring with an ethyl group in the para position, and a propanoic acid group attached to the ortho position.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would be a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para position.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group at the para position, but no acid group. So, if X were an acid chloride, and after hydrolysis, we would get a benzoic acid, which would suggest Option C or A.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data again. The peak at 10.5 ppm is a singlet for 1H, which would fit a carboxylic acid O-H. So the product after reaction is a carboxylic acid, which would suggest that Compound X was an acid chloride.

So, the starting material is an acid chloride. Let's think about the structure of Compound X. If in the NMR, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, that suggests substituents on the benzene ring. The downfield shifts are due to electron-withdrawing groups.

So, the substituent on the benzene would be a group like a carbonyl, perhaps as an acyl chloride.

Wait, but the aromatic ring in the NMR has two doublets, which as I thought before, suggests a para-disubstituted ring. So, perhaps the substituents are two groups on opposite positions. For example, one group is a carbonyl chloride (like an acyl chloride) and another is an alkyl group.

Wait, but then the NMR would show more substituents. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a side chain that includes a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzoyl chloride with a substituent. Let me think.

Wait, in the NMR, besides the aromatic protons, there are signals from a CH2 group (maybe in the 2.9 and 1.7 regions), a methyl at 1.4 ppm (as a doublet, which might be a geminal methyl, like CH(CH3)), and a terminal CH2CH2CH3 group (the 0.9 ppm triplet).

So, putting that together, perhaps the structure is a benzoyl chloride with a substituent that is a (sec-butyl) group attached to the ring.

Wait, let me try to sketch a possible structure. The benzene ring has a substituent at position para. That substituent is a group that includes a carbonyl.

Wait, but wait—Compound X has an IR peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. If X is an acid chloride, the carbonyl would be higher, around 1800. So perhaps that's not an acid chloride. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or a ketone.

Hmm, maybe I need to re-examine the IR data. The peak at 1720 could be an ester carbonyl. But then, if X is an ester, reacting with red phosphorus and HI might not do much. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, but then I don't see any O-H in the IR except for the broad peak around 3400.

Wait, the IR shows 3400–2500 cm-1, which could be from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. If the O-H is from an acid, then the 1720 cm-1 is likely an ester or a ketone. Wait, but wait, maybe it's an acyl chloride. Because in an acyl chloride, the carbonyl is higher, around 1800, but 1720 is possible if it's an ester or an acid.

Wait, perhaps X is a phenyl ester. Let me think about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzophenone (a ketone attached to a benzene ring), but then the O-H in the IR might not fit. Alternatively, maybe X is a methyl benzoate. Let's think: methyl benzoate would have an ester group, so the carbonyl would be around 1720 cm-1. The IR would show O-H if it's an acid, but if it's an ester, maybe no O-H. Wait, but the IR here has a broad peak around 3400-2500 cm-1. That could be from an alcohol, but if it's an ester, perhaps that's not the case. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzoic acid derivative, but then why the IR shows 1720 cm-1? Because benzoic acid's carbonyl is around 1700. Hmm, maybe an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde, but that's a carbonyl around 1700. But then O-H would be absent.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound has both an O-H group and a carbonyl, making it an acid. So the IR 1720 would be the acid's carbonyl. But that would make the O-H a strong broad peak. So the 10.5 ppm in NMR is the -OH proton of a carboxylic acid.

If that's the case, then the structure of X is a carboxylic acid with a substituent on the benzene ring. But wait, when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's a reaction that doesn't change the acid group. Or maybe the reaction is something else.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of acid chlorides to carboxylic acids. So if X is an acid chloride, then the reaction would produce the corresponding acid. So, perhaps X is an acid chloride, and the product is the acid.

So, let's think that X is an acid chloride. So the structure of X would be an aromatic ring with a substituent that includes an acyl chloride group.

Looking at the NMR data again, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, which is consistent with a para-substituted ring. So, perhaps the substituent is an acyl chloride attached to the benzene ring. Let's say it's at the para position.

But wait, the aromatic protons in para-substituted benzene will be two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches with the data. So, if the substituent is an acyl chloride (like -COCl), then the structure would have a benzene ring with a group like -COCl at one position and another substituent.

Wait, but looking at the other NMR signals:

The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) could be part of a CH group. Then 1.7 (m, 2H) would be CH2, and 1.4 (d, 3H) is a methyl attached to a CH. The 0.9 (t, 3H) is a terminal CH2CH2CH3.

Putting this together, perhaps the acyl group is a propanoyl group attached to the benzene ring. Wait, but if it's an acyl chloride, the structure would be something like benzoyl chloride, but with a substituent on the ring.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a side chain. For example, the substituent is a -(CH2)n group leading to a carbonyl chloride.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group attached to the ring, and the acyl chloride is part of that substituent. Hmm, but I'm not getting it right away.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (sec-butyl) group attached to the benzene ring, and the carbonyl is part of that substituent.

Wait, let's try to construct the structure. Let's say the benzene ring has a substituent at position 4 (para), which is a group R. R is a chain that includes a carbonyl chloride. So, perhaps R is a -(CH2)CH(CH2CH2CH3)-COCl group? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substitution is a propyl chain attached to the benzene, with a carbonyl chloride at the end. But that would make the substituent a propionyl chloride group attached directly to the ring.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data again, the 2.9 ppm (1H, m) could be a CH adjacent to a carbonyl. The 1.7 (2H, m) would be two CH2 groups. The 1.4 (d, 3H) could be a methyl group attached to a CH, which is itself attached to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that is a (CH2)2CH(CH3)COCl group. So, the substituent would be a -CH2-CH2-C(CH3)-COCl group attached to the benzene ring. But wait, that might complicate the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2CH2CH2CH3) group attached to the ring, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the options given and see which structure fits the spectral data.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the structure is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para position. So, the benzene ring has a COOH group at one position and a sec-butyl group at the opposite position.

If X is the acid chloride corresponding to this (4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride), then when treated with red phosphorus and HI, it would hydrolyze to the acid.

So, in the NMR of X, would that structure make sense? Let's see.

The benzene ring with a para substituent (sec-butyl and COCl). Wait, but in that case, the substituents would be COCl and a sec-butyl group. So, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, as observed in the NMR. The COCl group is an electron-withdrawing group, which deshields the aromatic protons, making them downfield.

In the NMR of the original X (the acid chloride), the aromatic protons would be at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. That matches the data given.

The other signals in X's NMR would come from the substituent. The substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the ring. Wait, no—X is the acid chloride, so the substituent is a Cl attached to a carbonyl, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me think again. If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride, its structure would be a benzene ring with a Cl-CO-group at one position and a sec-butyl group at the para position.

But wait, that would mean the substituents are both on the ring, so the aromatic ring is 4-(sec-butyl) and 1-COCl. So, the substituents are at positions 1 and 4. That would make the ring para-substituted with two groups. So the NMR would show two doublets for the aromatic protons, which is what the data shows.

Now, looking at the substituents. The substituent is a sec-butyl group. The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-. So, attached to the benzene ring.

In the NMR, the substituent's protons would show up as follows:

The CH(CH3) would be a triplet or some multiplet. Wait, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the CH group (since it's a multiplet, maybe from coupling with adjacent CH2 groups.

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the adjacent CH2 groups.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be the methyl group attached to the CH.

The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) would be the terminal CH2CH2CH3 group.

Wait, but in a sec-butyl group, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Hmm, maybe I'm getting the substituent wrong.

Wait, no, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, that's actually a tert-butyl group. No, wait, no: a sec-butyl group is: CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, but attached via the middle carbon. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms.

Wait, but in any case, the substituent seems to have a chain with a methyl branch.

Alternatively, the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, leading to the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (3-methylbutyl) group. No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, let's think about the substituent as a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the ring. Then, the CH(CH2CH3) would have a proton that could be split into a multiplet.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another group. So perhaps it's a -CH(CH3)- group.

So, putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the ring. Wait, that would make it a pentyl group or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (propyl) group with a methyl branch. Let me try to think of the substituent as a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the ring. But that would make the substituent a isobutyl group, perhaps.

Wait, if the substituent is an isobutyl group attached to the ring, then the structure would be 4-isobutylbenzoyl chloride.

So, the structure would be benzoyl chloride (Cl-CO-) attached to a benzene ring, and an isobutyl group attached at the para position.

Wait, but then the substituents would be at positions 1 and 4. The NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, which matches the data.

The substituent is an isobutyl group. So, the NMR signals would correspond to the isobutyl structure. Let's think:

The isobutyl group is CH2-CH(CH3)-. So, the CH(CH3) would have a proton that would be a septet (if adjacent to a CH2), but in this case, perhaps it's a triplet or some other multiplet.

Wait, the NMR signals in the substituent:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): perhaps the CH(CH3) group.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): the adjacent CH2 groups.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): the methyl attached to CH.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): the terminal methyl of the isobutyl group.

Wait, but the isobutyl group is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- something. Wait, no, the isobutyl group is -(CH2)2CH(CH3)- no, wait. The structure of isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait no, isobutyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, but that's not correct. Let me correct this.

Isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. No, wait, isobutyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. No, perhaps it's better to draw it.

Wait, the isobutyl group is:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- ?

Wait, no, the isobutyl group is actually a four-carbon group: CH2-CH(CH3)-.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me define it properly. The isobutyl group is a substituent where the chain is attached to the second carbon of a butane chain, so it's CH2CH(CH3)2. But that's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the substituent as a (sec-butyl) group. The structure of sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the options.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, if X is the acid chloride, the product after hydrolysis is this acid.

So, the starting material X would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride. Let's see what the NMR would look like.

The benzoyl chloride group would have the aromatic protons as two doublets, which matches. The substituent is a sec-butyl group, so the NMR would show the following:

- The CH2 groups adjacent to the branch would appear as a multiplet around 2.9 ppm (1H) and 1.7 ppm (2H). The CH(CH3) group would have a proton that is split into a multiplet. The methyl (CH3) attached to the CH would appear as a doublet at 1.4 ppm. The terminal CH2CH2CH3 would appear as a triplet at 0.9 ppm.

Putting this together, the NMR data matches what is given. So, X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride.

When X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes hydrolysis to form 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the product of a reaction where Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The IR and NMR data provided suggest that Compound X contains an aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and an O-H group. The IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl group, and the broad peak at 10.5 ppm in the NMR suggests an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid. The aromatic protons at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) indicate a para-substituted benzene ring.

The NMR signals for the substituents include a multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H), a multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H), a doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H), and a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H). These signals correspond to a sec-butyl group, which is a four-carbon chain with a methyl branch. This matches the structure of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride, where the benzene ring has a carbonyl chloride group at one position and a sec-butyl group at the para position.

When Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes hydrolysis of the acid chloride group to form the corresponding carboxylic acid. Thus, the final product is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The correct answer is **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
