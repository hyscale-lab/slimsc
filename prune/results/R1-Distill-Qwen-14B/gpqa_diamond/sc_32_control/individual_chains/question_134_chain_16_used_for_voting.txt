Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, enthalpy of neutralization is usually about the heat released when an acid reacts with a base, right? The neutralization reaction typically produces water and a salt. But wait, I remember that the enthalpy change for neutralization is usually given per mole of H+ or OH- ions involved.

Let me think about the problem. The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the problem says when these three are mixed. Wait, that's a bit confusing because HCl and H2SO4 are acids, and Ba(OH)2 is a base. So when you mix acids and a base, they should neutralize each other. But which ones?

Wait, the problem says "when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed." So all three are mixed together. So the acids and the base will react. But how?

First, I need to figure out the moles of each acid and each base present. Because HCl and H2SO4 are acids, and Ba(OH)2 is a base. So the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base.

Wait, but H2SO4 is a strong acid but it's diprotic, meaning it can donate two H+ ions per molecule. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and each formula unit provides two OH- ions, right? Because Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-.

So to calculate the neutralization, I need to find the total moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base. Then, determine which is in excess, and calculate the enthalpy based on the limiting reagent.

Let's start by calculating each component.

First, HCl. 500 mL is 0.5 L. 0.2 M means 0.2 moles per liter. So moles of HCl = 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it will dissociate completely, so moles of H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

Next, H2SO4. 300 mL is 0.3 L. 0.3 M is 0.3 moles per liter. So moles of H2SO4 is 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But each H2SO4 gives 2 H+ ions. So total moles of H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

So total H+ from both acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base, Ba(OH)2. 200 mL is 0.2 L. 0.5 M means 0.5 moles per liter. So moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions, so moles of OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

So, the H+ is 0.28 moles, and OH- is 0.2 moles. The reaction between H+ and OH- is 1:1, so 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+. That leaves 0.08 moles of H+ unreacted.

Wait, but wait. Do the acids completely neutralize the base, or is there some acid left? Hmm. If there's more H+ than OH-, then the excess H+ will determine the neutralization. Wait, no, wait. Because in neutralization, the H+ and OH- combine to form water. So the moles of H+ and OH- will determine how much neutralization occurs.

So, the H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So the OH- will be the limiting reagent. All 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and 0.08 moles of H+ will remain.

Wait, but the question is about enthalpy of neutralization. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually about 57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-) reacting, but wait, is that correct?

Wait, I remember that the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is approximately -57 kJ/mol of H+ (since the reaction is exothermic, the delta H is negative). So each mole of H+ reacting releases about 57 kJ.

Wait, wait. Let me get that clear. The enthalpy of neutralization (ΔH) is usually given per mole of H+ or OH- that reacts. For strong acids and bases, it's around -57 kJ per mole. So if 1 mole of H+ reacts, it's -57 kJ.

So in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ react with 0.2 moles of OH-. So the total enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. Wait, but the options are in kcal and kJ. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Hmm. So option B is -11.42 kcal, and option D is -16 kJ. Wait, because 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So 11.42 kcal is roughly 47.7 kJ. But my calculation gave me 11.4 kJ.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused. So I calculated 0.2 moles of H+ reacting, each giving -57 kJ. So 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ, so the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ. But the options have D as -16.0 kJ, which is a bit higher than that. Or perhaps the value used for enthalpy is different?

Wait, perhaps the standard enthalpy is 57 kJ per mole of H+? Or is it per mole of reaction, considering the stoichiometry?

Wait, the reaction between H+ and OH- is:

H+ + OH- → H2O, ΔH = -57 kJ per mole.

So for each mole of H+ that reacts, it's -57 kJ. So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

So the correct answer would be around -11.4 kJ, but looking at the options, the only one close to that is option D: -16.0 kJ. Wait, no. Wait, option D is -16 kJ, which is larger than 11.4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations.

HCl: 500 mL * 0.2 M = 0.5 L * 0.2 = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL * 0.3 M = 0.3 L * 0.3 = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL * 0.5 M = 0.2 L * 0.5 = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is limiting. All 0.2 mol OH- will react, neutralizing 0.2 mol H+.

So enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options don't have -11.4 kJ. Oh wait, option B is -11.42 kcal. Oh, perhaps I need to convert kJ to kcal.

Wait, 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So 11.4 kJ is how many kcal?

11.4 kJ / 4.184 ≈ 2.726 kcal. So that would be approximately -2.726 kcal, which is close to option A (-2.72 kcal). But wait, why? Because I thought the enthalpy per mole is in kJ, not kcal.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the calculation.

Wait, let me think again. The enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and a strong base is usually about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or H2O formed, which is the same). So 0.2 moles would give 11.4 kJ. So that's -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. There's a big discrepancy here. So perhaps I made a mistake in determining the moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait, wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So in solution, it dissociates completely to H+ and HSO4^- (which further dissociates into H+ and SO4^2-). So each H2SO4 gives 2 H+ ions. So that part was correct.

Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-, so each mole gives 2 OH- ions. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should consider the possibility that H2SO4 is not a strong acid. Wait, no, H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation (H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-?), Wait, no, wait. Wait, sulfuric acid is a strong acid but only the first H+ ionizes completely. The second H+ (from HSO4^-) is a weaker acid and doesn't fully dissociate. So in a 0.3 M H2SO4 solution, the concentration of H+ would be approximately 0.6 M, because the first H+ is fully dissociated, and the second is only partial. But wait, that's a more precise approach.

Wait, but in the given problem, do I consider the second dissociation? Because if H2SO4 is a diprotic acid but the second H+ doesn't fully dissociate, then the actual H+ concentration (and moles) would be higher than I calculated earlier.

Wait, but wait. When dealing with strong acids, like H2SO4, the first H+ is completely ionized, but the second is not. So for H2SO4, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, correction: H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but the first dissociation is complete, producing H+ and HSO4^-.

The second dissociation, HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-, is not complete. But in dilute solutions, it's about 100% ionized. Wait, no, that's not correct. The second dissociation has a higher pKa (around 1.99) if I remember correctly, so in a solution like 0.3 M, it's not fully ionized.

Wait, but for the purposes of this problem, perhaps I should assume that H2SO4 is a strong acid and both H+ are released. Because the problem gives H2SO4 as 0.3 M, and in many high school problems, it's considered as fully dissociated into 2 H+.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to treat H2SO4 as giving 2 moles of H+ per mole. So in that case, my initial calculation is correct.

So going back, the moles of H+ are 0.28, OH- are 0.2.

So the neutralization reaction uses 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-, producing 0.2 moles of water.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher than this, and option B is -11.42 kcal, which would be about -49 kJ (since 11.42 kcal *4.184 ≈ 47.7 kJ), which is higher than 11.4 kJ.

Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. For example, sometimes it's given as 55.8 kJ/mol.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate using a different enthalpy value. Let me check: standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole, but sometimes it's given as -56.1 kJ/mol, or other values depending on the source.

Suppose the problem uses 57 kJ per mole, and the calculation is correct, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the moles.

Wait, moles of HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 = 0.1. Correct.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 = 0.09. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18. Correct.

Total H+ = 0.28.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 = 0.1. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles. Correct.

So the limiting reagent is OH- with 0.2 moles.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, none of them are -11.4 kJ. The options are A) -2.72 kcal (~-11.4 kJ), B) -11.42 kcal (~-49 kJ), C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

Wait, option A is -2.72 kcal. Let's compute that in kJ: 2.72 * 4.184 ≈ 11.4 kJ. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is approximately equal to -11.4 kJ.

So that would make option A the correct answer, but the units are in kcal, but the question asks for the enthalpy in which unit? The options have a mix of kcal and kJ.

Wait, the question says "calculate the enthalpy of neutralization." Typically, enthalpy is expressed in kJ or J. But the options have both.

So my calculation is -11.4 kJ. The option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not close. Option A is -2.72 kcal, which is roughly -11.4 kJ. So perhaps the correct answer is option A. But why would the answer be expressed in kcal?

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is given as per mole of H+ as 2.72 kcal, which would give the answer as A.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again about the enthalpy value.

Wait, 1 calorie is 4.184 joules, so 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ. So 57 kJ is approximately 13.6 kcal. Wait, no. 57 kJ is 57000 J, which is 57000 / 4184 ≈ 13.6 kcal.

Wait, so if the enthalpy per mole is -57 kJ (-13.6 kcal), then 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal (because 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72). So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is correct.

But wait, the problem is asking for the enthalpy in what units? The options mix both. So if the correct answer is -11.4 kJ, which option D is -16 kJ, which doesn't match. Alternatively, if the correct answer is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but in the question, is the answer supposed to be in kcal or kJ? The options have both. So perhaps the correct answer is option B, but why?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of H+ or OH- moles.

Wait, HCl is 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4 is 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ is 0.28.

Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M *0.2 L= 0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

So 0.2 OH- will neutralize 0.2 H+.

So 0.2 moles of H+ reacting. So 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

But the options are A: -2.72 kcal, which is approximately -11.4 kJ, and D: -16 kJ. So the correct answer is either A or D.

Wait, so if the problem expects the answer in kcal, then option A is correct. Because 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal.

But the options have D as -16 kJ, which doesn't match 11.4 kJ. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the stoichiometry. Let's think about the neutralization reaction.

The reaction between H+ and OH- is:

H+ + OH- → H2O, ΔH = -57 kJ/mol.

So for each mole of H+ that reacts, the enthalpy change is -57 kJ.

In this case, 0.2 moles of H+ react, so ΔH = 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

So the correct answer is -11.4 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16 kJ, which is more than that. So none of the options match exactly. Hmm, this is a problem.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of H+ or OH-.

Wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but does it donate two H+ ions in one mole? Or is it considered as one H+ because the second isn't fully ionized?

In many school problems, H2SO4 is treated as giving two H+ per mole, so 0.09 * 2 would be 0.18 H+.

If the second H+ isn't considered, then H+ would be 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.09 (from H2SO4, only one H+) = 0.19.

Then, moles of H+ is 0.19. Ba(OH)2 has 0.2 OH-.

So H+ is 0.19, OH- is 0.2. So all 0.19 H+ neutralizes, leaving 0.01 OH-.

So the enthalpy change would be 0.19 * (-57) = -10.83 kJ, which is about -10.83 kJ. Which is approximately -2.58 kcal (since 10.83 /4.184 ≈ 2.58), which is close to option A (-2.72 kcal), but not exact.

But in this case, the problem states H2SO4 as 0.3 M, and if it's considered a diprotic strong acid, then the second H+ is also fully ionized, so the initial calculation of 0.28 H+ is correct.

Thus, the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

Looking back at the options, none is exactly -11.4 kJ, but option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -49 kJ. That's way off.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different enthalpy value, like -50 kJ/mol instead of -57. Let me recalculate with 50 kJ.

0.2 moles * (-50) = -10 kJ. So that would be around -2.387 kcal. No option matches.

Hmm, maybe I should check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal ≈ -11.4 kJ

B) -11.42 kcal ≈ -49 kJ

C) -3.80 kcal ≈ -15.87 kJ

D) -16.0 kJ

So the only option that matches the -11.4 kJ is option A as -2.72 kcal.

But the problem states the answer in what units? It doesn't specify, but looking at the options, both units are present.

Wait, perhaps the question is expecting the answer in kJ, so the correct option would be -11.4 kJ. But none of the options are -11.4 kJ. The closest is option D: -16 kJ. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the H+ and OH- contributions.

Wait, another thought: when mixing these solutions, the total volume is 500+300+200 = 1000 mL = 1 L. But does that affect anything? No, because moles are already calculated correctly.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles of OH-.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 mol. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the neutralization reaction's stoichiometry is different. For example, considering that H2SO4 is diprotic, and Ba(OH)2 is a divalent base, perhaps the mole ratio is different.

Wait, let's think about the reaction:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

But wait, that's a neutralization reaction, but H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So the reaction would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4↓ + 2 H2O.

So the mole ratio is 1:1. So each mole of H2SO4 reacts with 1 mole of Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but H2SO4 gives 2 H+ and Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so the mole ratio is indeed 1:1.

So let's recalculate the moles of each acid and base.

Wait, but I think this approach would complicate things because we have two acids and one base. So the base will first react with H2SO4, and any remaining will react with HCl.

So maybe I should approach it that way.

Wait, because H2SO4 is a strong acid and reacts first with the base.

So first, let's calculate how much H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 are present.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.1 mol of the base.

The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is 1:1.

So moles of H2SO4: 0.09, Ba(OH)2:0.1. So H2SO4 is limiting.

So 0.09 mol H2SO4 will react with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2.

Each mole of H2SO4 contributes 2 H+, and each mole of Ba(OH)2 contributes 2 OH-.

So the reaction consumes 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+ and 0.09 *2 = 0.18 moles OH-.

So after this reaction, the remaining moles:

H+ from H2SO4: 0.09 *2 = 0.18. After reaction, all 0.18 H+ are consumed.

H+ from HCl: 0.1 mol.

So total remaining H+ is 0.1.

The OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 mol in Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 mol OH-.

Wait, no. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 mol. So OH- is 0.2 mol. After reacting with 0.09 mol H2SO4, which uses 0.18 OH-, remaining OH- is 0.2 - 0.18 = 0.02 mol.

So now, the remaining H+ is 0.1 (from HCl), and remaining OH- is 0.02.

Now, these will react: 0.1 H+ and 0.02 OH-.

Which is the limiting reagent? H+ is in excess. So 0.02 OH- will react with 0.02 H+, producing 0.02 H2O.

So total moles of H+ that have reacted: 0.18 (from H2SO4) + 0.02 (from HCl) = 0.20.

Moles of OH- that reacted: 0.18 (from Ba(OH)2 with H2SO4) + 0.02 (from Ba(OH)2 with HCl) = 0.20.

So total H+ reacted: 0.20.

Thus, the total enthalpy change is 0.20 mol * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

So the same result as before.

So why is the option D -16 kJ?

Wait, perhaps the problem considers the neutralization of both H+ from H2SO4 and HCl with the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the total H+ and OH-.

Wait, another approach: calculate total H+ and total OH-.

Total H+ = 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28.

Total OH- = 0.2 (Ba(OH)2).

So OH- is 0.2, which is less than H+ (0.28). So all OH- will react, neutralizing 0.2 H+.

So enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, which is -2.72 kcal, as that's approximately -11.4 kJ.

Wait, let me compute: 11.4 kJ is 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So -2.72 kcal is equivalent to -11.4 kJ.

So option A is correct.

But why is option D present? Because option D is -16 kJ, which doesn't match. I think the correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal, so option A is correct.

So the correct answer is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we first determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H⁺
- **HCl**:  
  \( \text{Moles of HCl} = 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Since HCl is a strong acid, it fully dissociates, contributing \( 0.1 \, \text{mol H⁺} \).

- **H₂SO₄**:  
  \( \text{Moles of H₂SO₄} = 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
  H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid, and both H⁺ ions are assumed to dissociate, contributing \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol H⁺} \).

- **Total H⁺**:  
  \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol H⁺} \).

### Step 2: Calculate moles of OH⁻
- **Ba(OH)₂**:  
  \( \text{Moles of Ba(OH)₂} = 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Each Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 OH⁻ ions, contributing \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol OH⁻} \).

### Step 3: Determine the limiting reagent
The neutralization reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻ occurs in a 1:1 molar ratio.  
- Total H⁺ available: \( 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).  
- Total OH⁻ available: \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  

Since OH⁻ is present in a smaller amount, it is the limiting reagent. All \( 0.2 \, \text{mol OH⁻} \) will react, neutralizing \( 0.2 \, \text{mol H⁺} \).

### Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy change
The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol H⁺} \).  
- Moles of H⁺ neutralized: \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
- Enthalpy change:  
  \( \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

### Step 5: Convert to kcal (if necessary)
Since \( 1 \, \text{kcal} = 4.184 \, \text{kJ} \),  
\( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} = \frac{-11.4}{4.184} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

### Step 6: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) matches the calculated value of \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \) when converted.  
- **Option B**: \( -11.42 \, \text{kcal} \) is equivalent to \( -49 \, \text{kJ} \), which is incorrect.  
- **Option C**: \( -3.80 \, \text{kcal} \) is equivalent to \( -15.87 \, \text{kJ} \), which is incorrect.  
- **Option D**: \( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \) is incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.

Answer: A
