Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that extends the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. These operators are classified by their dimension and the symmetries they respect.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

Let me think about each symmetry. Lorentz symmetry is fundamental in relativity. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, right? So all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. That makes sense because the Standard Model itself is Lorentz symmetric, and SMEFT is an extension of it.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Wait, Poincare symmetry is also a big one. The Standard Model respects Poincare, so SMEFT must too. So both Lorentz and Poincare are required. But I'm a bit fuzzy on whether they are separate points here. Because Poincare includes translations, which are part of the overall symmetry. But in the SMEFT, the effective theory is formulated in a way that respects Poincare, so the operators must respect it. So 1 and 2 are correct.

Now CP and CPT symmetries. Wait, the Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry, right? Because of things like CP violation in the CKM matrix. Oh wait, wait, but in the Standard Model, the symmetry is considered at the level of the operators. Wait, the SMEFT is built with operators that are renormalizable or higher. But do the operators have to respect CP or CPT?

I remember that in the SMEFT, the operators are organized in a way that maintains certain symmetries. The SM itself has CPT symmetry, but not necessarily CP. But when it comes to the operators in SMEFT, they must be built respecting the symmetries that the SM respects. Or is it that SMEFT doesn't necessarily enforce any of them unless the operator dimension or other constraints require it?

Wait, SMEFT operators are classified by their dimension and the gauge symmetries. But for other symmetries like CP, I think that the operators may or may not respect them. For example, some operators in SMEFT can violate CP. So maybe the operators don't have to respect CP symmetry. But what about CPT?

CPT symmetry is a big one. In quantum field theory, all renormalizable theories respect CPT symmetry. Because they have to obey the principles of quantum mechanics and relativity. So in SMEFT, which is an effective theory, I think all operators must respect CPT. Because if they didn't, it would imply some serious issues with causality and unitarity.

Let me recap. So Lorentz and Poincare (1 and 2) must be respected because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. CPT (4) must be respected because any valid QFT must have CPT symmetry. What about CP (3)? Since the SM already violates CP, SMEFT allows for CP-violating operators. So operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry.

So the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). Wait, but wait, Poincare is a combination of Lorentz and translations. So if Lorentz is already required, and Poincare includes that plus translations, does the question treat Lorentz and Poincare as separate? Because in the options, they're listed separately. So the operators must respect both, but wait, Poincare is a larger symmetry group that includes Lorentz. Or is Lorentz included in Poincare? Because Poincare symmetry includes translations and Lorentz transformations. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz.

Wait, no. The question is whether all operators must respect each symmetry. So if they are required to respect Poincare (option 2), then they also respect Lorentz (option 1). So both 1 and 2 must be true, but Poincare is a stronger condition.

Wait, but I think that the SMEFT operators are required to respect Lorentz symmetry, but do they all also have to respect Poincare? Because Poincare includes both translations and Lorentz. Well, in the Standard Model, the Poincare symmetry is a fundamental symmetry, so SMEFT must respect it. Therefore, operators would have to respect both Lorentz and Poincare. Hmm, but maybe in this context, Poincare is considered as a separate symmetry.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. The Poincare group is the group of isometries of Minkowski spacetime, which includes translations (forming the group T4) and Lorentz transformations (forming the Lorentz group L). So the Poincare group is T4 × L. So respecting Poincare symmetry means respecting both translations and Lorentz.

But in the SMEFT, the operators are built in such a way that the theory is Poincare invariant. So all operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz symmetry. So if operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. But the question lists Lorentz and Poincare as separate options, asking which must be respected by all operators.

Wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if an operator respects Poincare, it must already respect Lorentz. So if the question says whether all operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare, then both 1 and 2 would be correct. So in that case, both 1 and 2 are required.

But I'm a bit confused because the Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz. So if an operator respects Poincare, it must also respect Lorentz. So maybe the question is considering both as separate, but in reality, if they respect Poincare, Lorentz is automatically respected. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

But wait, the question is phrased as "must be respected by all operators", so both 1 and 2 are correct, but let me think about whether all operators are required to respect both.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is whether each symmetry is required. So for Lorentz symmetry (1), all operators must respect it. For Poincare (2), all operators must respect it as well. And for CPT (4), yes, because CPT is a fundamental symmetry in QFT. So 1,2,4 must be respected.

Wait, but the options don't have all four. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A) 1,2

B) 3,4

C) 1,2,4

D)1,3,4

Wait, so option C says 1,2,4. So that would imply that Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT are all required, but CP is not. And since the question is about which must be respected by all operators, that would make sense.

But wait, why must Poincare be required? Because SMEFT is built respecting Poincare. So all terms in the Lagrangian must be Poincare invariant. So yes, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes translations and Lorentz.

So in that case, the correct symmetries are 1,2,4. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but another angle: Are Poincare and Lorentz considered separate symmetries in this context? Because Poincare is a larger group. So for an operator to respect Poincare, it must respect Lorentz and translations. So if the question is about which symmetries must be respected, both 1 and 2 would be correct. So the operators must respect both.

But in reality, if they respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz, but the question is about which symmetries are required, so maybe only Poincare is needed as a requirement. Wait, but the question lists Lorentz and Poincare as separate options. So perhaps the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare as separate symmetries. But that can't be, because Poincare includes Lorentz. So perhaps the correct answer is that operators must respect both, but in the options, 1 and 2 are both correct.

But let me think again. In the SMEFT, all operators must be Poincare invariant. So yes, operators must respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz. So the question is, do the operators have to respect Lorentz in addition to Poincare? Or is respecting Poincare sufficient, implying Lorentz is automatically respected.

In the question, the options are presented as separate. So if the question is about whether each symmetry is a must, then both Lorentz and Poincare would be correct. But then, why would the question include both as separate options?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me think of another approach: The Standard Model is a Poincare-invariant theory. SMEFT is an effective theory that respects all the symmetries of the Standard Model, including Poincare, but may include higher-dimension operators. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry, which in turn includes Lorentz. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

So including CPT (option 4). Since CPT is a symmetry that must hold in any Lorentz-invariant theory, and since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, all operators must respect CPT. But CP (option 3) is not necessarily respected, as the Standard Model itself already violates CP.

Therefore, the correct symmetries are 1, 2, and 4. So looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the answer is C.

In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), operators are constructed to respect certain symmetries that are fundamental to the Standard Model and quantum field theory. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, as it extends the Standard Model, which itself respects Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is formulated as a Poincaré-invariant effective theory, all operators must respect Poincaré symmetry. While Lorentz symmetry is part of Poincaré symmetry, the question explicitly lists them as separate, so both must be considered.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model already violates CP symmetry (e.g., through the CKM matrix). SMEFT allows for CP-violating operators, so CP symmetry is not necessarily respected by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, it must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected. Therefore, the correct combination of symmetries is 1, 2, and 4.
