Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution being relevant here. Boltzmann distribution relates the population of particles in different energy states to temperature. Right.

The energy difference between the two levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is the Boltzmann constant, right? Oh wait, no, the Boltzmann constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, so the energy difference ΔE is k multiplied by some temperature-related term? Or wait, no, the energy difference is given, and we need to relate that to the temperature.

The problem states that in star_1, the number of iron atoms in the excited state is twice that of star_2. So, if I denote the ratio of populations as n1/n2 = 2, where n1 is the population in star_1 and n2 in star_2.

The Boltzmann distribution formula is n_i/n_j = exp(-(E_i - E_j)/(kT)). Since they are talking about a specific energy level, perhaps they are comparing the same energy level in each star? Or wait, maybe they're considering two different energy levels. Wait, the question says the energy difference between the considered energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. Oh, but that's exactly k, because 1.38e-23 is k. So ΔE = k.

Wait, wait, the energy difference is ΔE = E_upper - E_lower = 1.38e-23 J. So for each star, the ratio of n_upper to n_lower would depend on their respective temperatures.

Let me write down the Boltzmann equation for each star.

For star_1: n1_upper / n1_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

Similarly, for star_2: n2_upper / n2_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But wait, the question states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower).

Wait, no, actually, it's the other way around. Wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So does that mean that the fraction in the excited state is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2?

I think so. So for the same energy level, the population ratio is higher in star_1. So n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower).

But wait, let me think. Oh wait, no. The ratio of their populations is 2:1. So (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper)/(n2_lower).

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is per unit something else, but I think I should proceed.

So substituting the Boltzmann equations into this ratio:

(n1_upper/n1_lower) / (n2_upper/n2_lower) ) = 2.

Which is [exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] = 2.

Simplify the exponentials: exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2.

Take the natural logarithm of both sides: [ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1)] = ln(2).

Factor out ΔE/(k): ΔE/(k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2).

But wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k (since k is 1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k.

So substituting that in:

k/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2) → [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2).

Alternatively, rearranged: [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ] = ln(2).

Hmm, but the options are in terms of T1 and T2, so let me write this as:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2).

That can be rewritten as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Wait, let me see. 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )?

Wait, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Yes, because 1/T2 is T1/(T1 T2), and 1/T1 is T2/(T1 T2). So when you subtract, you get (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So the equation is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Which matches.

Wait, let me double-check the steps. Because sometimes the order can matter.

We have n1_upper/n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower).

Which becomes exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) / exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) = 2.

Which is exp( [ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1)] ) = 2.

Which is [ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] = ln(2).

Since ΔE = k, that simplifies to (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2).

Which is the same as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Which is exactly option D.

So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves comparing the excitation of iron atoms in the photospheres of two stars, star_1 and star_2, under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann distribution is used to relate the population of atoms in different energy levels to temperature. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which matches the Boltzmann constant \( k \).

For star_1, the ratio of atoms in the excited state to the ground state is \( n_{1,\text{upper}} / n_{1,\text{lower}} = \exp(-\Delta E / (k T_1)) \), and for star_2, it is \( n_{2,\text{upper}} / n_{2,\text{lower}} = \exp(-\Delta E / (k T_2)) \). The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2, so \( n_{1,\text{upper}} / n_{1,\text{lower}} = 2 \cdot (n_{2,\text{upper}} / n_{2,\text{lower}}) \).

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions into this ratio gives:

\[
\frac{\exp(-\Delta E / (k T_1))}{\exp(-\Delta E / (k T_2))} = 2
\]

Simplifying the exponentials:

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2)
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \), this simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2)
\]

Rewriting in terms of \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \):

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2)
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:
