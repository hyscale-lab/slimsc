Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each with two pH values.

First, I think I need to figure out what's happening at each step. Let's break it down.

Step 1: Dilution of acetic acid.

We have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration will change because concentration is inversely proportional to volume when the amount of substance is constant.

The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 M * 20) /40 = (1) /40? Wait, 0.05 * 20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, wait, 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) equals 0.001 moles. Then when we add 0.02 L water, the new volume is 0.04 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Step 2: Titration with NaOH.

The next part is the titration. NaOH is a strong base, reacting with acetic acid, a weak acid. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O

At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid.

Wait, but the problem is about two points: 25% titration and equivalence point.

But before that, let's find out how much NaOH is needed to reach the equivalence point, perhaps that will help.

Moles of acetic acid initially after dilution: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

Since each mole of acetic acid reacts with one mole of NaOH, the moles of NaOH needed to reach equivalence is also 0.001 moles.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So the equivalence point is after adding 10 cm³ of NaOH. But the first part is about 25% titration. Wait, 25% of what? The total volume needed to reach equivalence? So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at that point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

So for the 25% titration, we need to calculate the pH when 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added to the diluted acetic acid solution.

Let's handle the 25% titration first.

At 25% titration (2.5 cm³ of NaOH):

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

Since the reaction is 1:1, moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) will decrease by 0.00025 moles, and moles of acetate (CH3COO-) will increase by the same amount.

Initial moles after dilution: 0.001 moles of CH3COOH.

After adding NaOH:

Moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Moles of CH3COO^- = 0.00025 moles.

The total volume now is the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the added NaOH (2.5 cm³), so 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ let's calculate that. 0.00075 divided by 0.0425 is approximately 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)).

Wait, wait, pKa is the negative log of Ka. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that.

log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5). log(1.85) is about 0.2672, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.2672 -5 = -4.7328. So pKa is 4.7328. Approximately 4.73.

So pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)

Compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. So log(0.3333) is log(1/3) which is approx -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253. So around 4.25.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26; D is 4.57. So the 25% point is around 4.25, so option A or D. Let me check the options.

Option A: 4.26; 8.52.

Option D: 4.57; 6.92.

So for the first part, 25% titration, the pH is about 4.26, which matches option A's first value. But wait, let's check calculations more precisely.

Wait, wait, let me compute the moles again.

After adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, the moles of NaOH are 0.1 * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Correct.

So, moles of HA (acetic acid) = initial 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of A^- (acetate) = 0.00025 mol.

The total volume is 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ =42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] = 0.005882 / 0.017647 = (0.005882)/(0.017647) = approx 0.3333.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log(0.3333) = 4.73 + (-0.477) = 4.253, so 4.25. So the option A's first pH is 4.26, which is very close. Maybe a more accurate calculation would get 4.25 or 4.26.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Let me compute [A^-] and [HA] more accurately.

Moles HA = 0.00075, A^- = 0.00025.

Volume is 0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.0176470588 M.

[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.0058823529 M.

Ratio: 0.0058823529 / 0.0176470588 = 0.333333333.

So exactly 1/3.

Log(1/3) is log(0.333333) ≈ -0.4771.

So pH = 4.73 + (-0.4771) = 4.2529, which is ~4.25. So the first pH is approximately 4.25. Option A's first value is 4.26, so that's very close.

Now, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So the solution is sodium acetate in water. Since sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, the solution will be basic. So it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

The steps to find pH at equivalence:

1. Determine moles of sodium acetate at equivalence.

At equivalence, all 0.001 moles of acetic acid have reacted, producing 0.001 moles of acetate ions (CH3COO^-).

The total volume is the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (10 cm³), so 50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

2. The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Since Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C.

Kb = 1e-14 / (1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So we can set up the expression.

Let me denote [CH3COOH] = x, [OH^-] = x.

So Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x^2 / 0.02 since x will be very small compared to 0.02.

So x^2 ≈ Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ let's compute this.

log(3.288e-6) = log(3.288) + log(1e-6) ≈ 0.5168 -6 = -5.4832. So pOH is 5.4832.

pH = 14 - pOH = 14 -5.4832 = 8.5168, approximately 8.52.

So the pH at equivalence is around 8.52.

Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52. Option D has 4.57 and 6.92. So option A seems to match both the 25% and equivalence points.

Wait, but let me double-check the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, alternatively, sometimes people use the formula for the pH of a salt solution from a weak acid and strong base. The formula is pH = pKa + 1/2 pKw - ½ pKa? No, wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, perhaps using the approximation for the hydrolysis:

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb is Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approx 5.405e-10, correct.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

Concentration is 0.02 M.

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is small compared to 0.02, [CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.02.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 → pOH = 5.483 → pH = 8.517 → approx 8.52.

So yes, pH at equivalence is around 8.52. So the option with 4.26 and 8.52 is option A.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A is (A) 4.26; 8.52. So that's the first part and the equivalence point.

Wait, but the question is, does the 25% correspond to 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence? Because the problem says "at 25% titration", which typically refers to 25% of the volume required to reach equivalence.

In our case, the equivalence volume is 10 cm³. So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So yes, that's correct.

So the pH at 25% is approximately 4.25, and at equivalence is 8.52.

Looking at the options, option A matches these values.

Wait, but wait another thing: when we dilute the acetic acid, the initial concentration is 0.025 M, and then when we add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the solution's volume is 42.5 cm³. So the buffer is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use exact calculation without approximation.

Wait, let me double-check the buffer calculation without the Henderson-Hasselbalch approximation.

At 25% titration, the solution is a buffer of acetic acid and acetate. So let's write the expression for Ka.

Ka = [H+][A^-]/[HA]

We can rearrange to find [H+].

Ka = 1.85e-5 = [H+]*(0.00025/0.0425) / (0.00075/0.0425)

Simplify the ratio (0.00025/0.0425) / (0.00075/0.0425) = 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3.

So,

1.85e-5 = [H+] * (1/3)

→ [H+] = 3 * 1.85e-5 = 5.55e-5.

pH = -log(5.55e-5) ≈ 4.255. So ~4.26, which matches option A.

So yes, the 25% titration pH is 4.26.

Wait, but wait: why did the initial buffer approach give us 4.25, and exact calculation gives 4.255, which is 4.26? Oh, because the Henderson equation gives an approximate value. But the exact calculation via Ka expression gives 4.255, which rounds to 4.26. So that's correct.

Therefore, the correct option is A: 4.26; 8.52.

Wait, but looking again at the options, option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in some step.

Wait, let me check the equivalence point calculation again.

At equivalence point, we have 0.001 moles of acetate in 50 cm³ (0.05 L), so concentration is 0.02 M.

The Kb is 5.405e-10.

The expression for Kb is (x^2)/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, so x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = 3.288e-6.

So [OH^-] = 3.288e-6, pH is 8.52.

So that part's correct.

Wait, but let me think if there's any possibility I messed up the initial dilution.

Wait, initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluted with 20 cm³ of water. So total volume is 40 cm³. Moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Correct.

So the initial concentration after dilution is 0.001 / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Correct.

So all steps seem correct.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option A.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L) with a concentration of 0.05 M, so the moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{New concentration} = \frac{\text{Moles of acetic acid}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.04} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we analyze the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid. Since the moles of acetic acid are 0.001, the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume (10 cm³) is added, which is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH at 25% titration} = 0.25 \times 10 = 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

The moles of NaOH added at 25% titration are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

Since the reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is 1:1, the moles of acetic acid remaining are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid (HA)} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles},
\]

and the moles of acetate ion (A⁻) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate (A⁻)} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume of the solution at 25% titration is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{HA}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{A⁻}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A⁻}]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\), we calculate:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted, forming sodium acetate. The moles of acetate ion are 0.001, and the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{A⁻}] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{\text{K}_w}{\text{K}_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \([\text{OH}^-] = x\). Then:

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{A⁻}]} \implies x^2 = \text{K}_b \cdot [\text{A⁻}] = (5.41 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.08 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.08 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

Thus, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.

From the calculations, the pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:
