Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, so they're moving in the same direction. So I guess the relative speed isn't just the difference of their speeds because we're dealing with relativity, right?

I remember that in classical mechanics, relative speed is just the difference when moving in the same direction. But at relativistic speeds, we can't do that. We have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. Oh right, if one object is moving at u and the other at v in the same direction, then from u's frame, the relative speed of the other is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Or wait, wait, no—wait, the formula is (u' = (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²))), where u is the velocity of the object and v is the velocity of the frame. So if the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c, the relative speed of the second from the first's frame would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

Wait, 0.5c - 0.6c is -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. But since speed is a magnitude, the relative speed is 0.1428c. Wait, but in the options, I see 0.14c as an option, so that's probably correct.

Wait, but I should double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the order is reversed. Oh wait, no. If astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, then from A's frame, B is approaching at 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c, but the formula requires dividing by (1 - (u v)/(c²)), which in this case is (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/0.7 = approximately -0.1428c. So the magnitude is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c. So that's for the first part.

Now, about the total energy. The total energy of the system would be the sum of their relativistic energies. Remember, relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c². Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for astronaut 1, mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2, mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding them together: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So about 5.96 m c². Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option C says v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2. That matches what I have here. Option D has E=5 mc², which is lower, so probably not. Option B has E=4.96, which is too low. So the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The two astronauts are moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds of \( 0.6c \) and \( 0.5c \). The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to calculate the relative speed between them:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v - u}{1 - \frac{vu}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( v = 0.6c \) (the speed of the first astronaut) and \( u = 0.5c \) (the speed of the second astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7}
\]

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but since speed is a magnitude, the relative speed is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2 \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of the First Astronaut
Mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of the Second Astronaut
Mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
