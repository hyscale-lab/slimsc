Okay, I'm going to tackle this chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully and think through each step.

So the problem is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so the titration should form the acetate ion.

The initial solution is made by diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then it's titrated with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find pH at two points: 25% titration and equivalence point.

Let me break this down into parts.

First, when you mix equal volumes of acetic acid and water, the concentration changes. So the initial concentration after dilution is important. Wait, the initial volume of acetic acid is 20 cm³, and we add 20 cm³ of water. So total volume is 40 cm³.

The initial concentration can be calculated using the dilution equation: M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Then, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles? Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, but after adding 20 cm³, it's 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So yes, 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles of CH3COOH.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH added will be 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

At 25% titration, only a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So let's think about the solution at that point.

The initial solution after mixing is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M CH3COOH. Then, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added.

Wait, but when NaOH is added, it reacts with acetic acid: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid, moles of CH3COOH remaining would be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

And moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed would be 0.00025 moles.

But wait, the total volume after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

This is a buffer solution. The pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) ≈ 4.73 (since log(1.85e-5) is approx -4.73, so pKa is 4.73? Wait, let me compute: 1.85e-5. So log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647) = 4.733 + log(0.333). Log(0.333) is approximately -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. So about 4.26.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm.

Wait, but I should double-check. Let me compute 0.00025 / 0.0425 = approximately 0.005882 M. 0.00075 / 0.0425 is 0.017647 M. Ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333, so log(0.333) is -0.477. So the pH is 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256 → 4.26. So for the 25% titration, the pH should be 4.26.

Now the equivalence point. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. The solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution will be basic.

The moles of acetate ions at equivalence point are 0.001 moles. The total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis equation: Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-] produced, we can approximate x² / 0.02 ≈ 5.405e-10 → x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5 M → pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98 → pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but the options don't have a pH that high. Wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, no, my mistake. Wait, the Kb is 5.405e-10, correct. The initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So Kb = x²/(0.02 - x) ≈ x²/(0.02) because x is very small.

So x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 → [OH-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = 4.98 → pH = 14-4.98=9.02.

But looking at the options, the equivalence point pH's are 8.52 (option A), 6.73 (B), 7 (C), 6.92 (D). Wait, none are around 9. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me check.

Wait, wait a second. Alternatively, perhaps the concentration after equivalence is wrong. Wait, volume is 40 +10 cm³=50 cm³=0.05 L. Moles of acetate: 0.001 moles. So 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in Kb. Let me compute Kw / Ka again. Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kw = 1e-14 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approx 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Another way: perhaps I should use the same approximation method.

Wait, perhaps the solution is more precise. Let me compute x more accurately.

x² = Kb * C = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) = approx 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But none of the options have this. Hmm. So that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Maybe the volume is different.

Wait, initial volume of acetic acid is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M, so moles CH3COOH = 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. Correct. Then, moles NaOH needed to reach equivalence is 0.001 moles as well. NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. Correct.

So when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added, the total volume is 40 +10=50 cm³. So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

But the pH I calculated is ~9.02, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the problem uses a different approach for the equivalence pH.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the Kb. Let me do it again.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa ≈ 4.733. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the solution is using the formula for acetate ion:

[OH^-] = sqrt( Kb * C ) → sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

Which gives [OH^-] of 1.04e-5, pOH 4.98, pH 9.02. So not matching any options.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52

Option B: 3.17;6.73

Option C:4.73;7.00

Option D:4.57;6.92

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the pH at equivalence point. Maybe it's not as high as I thought. Alternatively, perhaps the solution isn't as dilute as I thought. Wait, 0.02 M is correct?

Another possibility: Maybe I should consider that the NaOH is strong and the solution is in a buffer region, but at equivalence point, all the acid is neutralized, so it's a solution of the conjugate base. So the pH should be higher than 7.

Hmm, all options except option A have equivalence pH less than 8.52. But I calculated 9.02.

So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the dilution calculations.

Wait, initial solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then adding 20 cm³ water. So total volume is 40 cm³.

Molarity after dilution: (20 cm³ *0.05 M ) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. Correct.

Equivalence point: moles of NaOH = 0.001, volume is 10 cm³. So the total volume after adding is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³. Correct.

So acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 =0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses an approximation where the acetate's hydrolysis is considered but perhaps I should use the exact quadratic formula instead of the approximation.

Let me set up the equation without approximation:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

Initial:
[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M
[CH3COOH] = 0
[OH^-] =0

Change:
- x
+ x
+ x

So Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

So x² =5.405e-10 (0.02 - x)

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02, so x²≈1.081e-11 → x≈1.04e-5 → same as before.

So the calculation holds. So I'm getting pH ~9.02, but the options don't have that. So maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial moles.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me recompute the moles of acetic acid.

Original volume: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M → moles = 0.02 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

So when titrated to equivalence, the moles of NaOH should be 0.001, which is 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Correct.

So the total volume is 50 cm³ → 0.05 L.

So acetate is 0.001 /0.05 =0.02 M.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach for the equivalence pH. Maybe using the same approach as the 25% point.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Let me recheck.

Ka =1.85e-5 → pKa=4.73. So Kb=14-4.73=9.27, which is pKb. So pOH= pKb + log(sqrt(C))?

Wait, no, the correct approach is to compute Kb = Kw/Ka.

Wait, another approach: for acetate ion, the concentration is 0.02 M.

The pH can be found using the formula:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) → but at equivalence point, [HA] is negligible because all the acid has been neutralized. Wait, no, [A^-] is the only thing present. So pH = pKa + log( [A^-]/[HA] ), but [HA] is zero, which would be undefined. So we have to approach it via the Kb method.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the pH using the concentration of acetate and the Kb.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me use the exact formula without approximation.

The equation is Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02. So x²≈5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11 → x≈1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] is ~1.04e-5, pOH=4.98, pH=9.02.

But again, none of the options match. So maybe I made a mistake in the initial problem.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the dilution correctly. Wait, when we dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the concentration becomes 0.025 M, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about equivalence point but the pH at equivalence point is around 8.5 or so. So maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of Kb. Let me compute it again.

Ka is 1.85e-5 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 → 1/1.85 is approx 0.5405 → so 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10. Correct.

Hmm, maybe the problem is using a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is not considering the acetate hydrolysis correctly.

Wait, another approach: the solution after equivalence is sodium acetate. The pH can be calculated using the formula:

pH = 14 - 0.5(pKa + log C)

Wait, no, that's not correct. Or perhaps the formula is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) but at equivalence, [HA] is zero, so perhaps another approach is needed.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong base. I think the formula is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). But in this case, [HA] is zero, which complicates things. So I must use the Kb approach.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it without approximation, even though x is small.

So, Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Let me set up the equation:

x² =5.405e-10 (0.02 - x)

x² = 1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1.081e-11 ) ] / 2

Compute discriminant:

(5.405e-10)^2 = (5.405)^2 *1e-20 = 29.218 *1e-20= 2.9218e-19.

4*1.081e-11 =4.324e-11.

Wait, 4.324e-11 is 4.324e-11 =4.324e-11 =4.324e-11 → 4.324e-11 is much larger than 2.9218e-19. So sqrt(4.324e-11)≈6.576e-6.

So x≈ [ -5.405e-10 ± 6.576e-6 ] / 2.

Take positive root:

x ≈ (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ 6.576e-6 / 2 ≈3.288e-6.

Wait, this is different from before. So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6 → pOH=5.49 → pH =14-5.49=8.51.

Ah! So that's about 8.51, which is close to option A's 8.52. So perhaps the initial approximation was wrong, and the more precise calculation gives a pH of around 8.51.

So, for the equivalence point, pH is approximately 8.52.

Wait, but why did the approximation give a pH around 9, while the exact calculation gives around 8.52?

Ah, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recalculate the exact x.

Wait, let's compute the quadratic formula again.

The equation is x² + (5.405e-10) x -1.081e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² +4ac) ]/(2a)

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D= b² +4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)(-1.081e-11)*(-1) ?

Wait, no: 4ac =4*(1)*(-1.081e-11)= -4.324e-11.

Wait wait, no. Original equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

Discriminant D= b² -4ac.

Wait, D = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11).

So D= (2.92e-19) +4.324e-11 → 4.324e-11 is much larger than 2.92e-19, so D≈4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)= approx 6.576e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ]/(2).

We take the positive root:

x = (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10 )/2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 ≈ 3.288e-6.

So [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.49 → pH=14-5.49=8.51.

Ah, so the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.51, which matches option A's 8.52.

So now, at 25% titration, pH was ~4.26, and at equivalence, pH ~8.52. So option A.

But wait, the first part: 25% titration. Did I get 4.26?

Yes, earlier calculation at 25% gave pH≈4.26. So option A's first value matches, and equivalence point pH of 8.52 matches the second part.

So, the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH at two points: 25% titration and equivalence point. The key steps are as follows:

### Initial Setup
1. **Dilution of Acetic Acid**:  
   The initial solution is made by mixing 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the diluted concentration is:  
   \[
   M_2 = \frac{0.05 \, \text{M} \times 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3}{40.00 \, \text{cm}^3} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
   \]

2. **Equivalence Point**:  
   At equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized by NaOH. The moles of acetic acid initially are:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.04 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
   \]  
   Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume of NaOH required to reach equivalence is:  
   \[
   V_{\text{NaOH}} = \frac{\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3.
   \]  
   At equivalence, the total volume is \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 \). The concentration of acetate ions (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) is:  
   \[
   [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
   \]  
   The solution at equivalence point is basic due to the hydrolysis of acetate ions:  
   \[
   \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
   \]  
   The \( K_b \) for acetate is calculated as:  
   \[
   K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
   \]  
   Using the formula \( [\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot C} \):  
   \[
   [\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{5.405 \times 10^{-10} \cdot 0.02} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
   \]  
   The pOH is:  
   \[
   \text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.49,
   \]  
   and the pH is:  
   \[
   \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.49 = 8.51.
   \]

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume (10.00 cm³) has been added, so \( 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 \) of 0.1 M NaOH has been added. The moles of NaOH added are:  
\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]  
This reacts with an equal amount of acetic acid, leaving:  
\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles},
\]  
and forming:  
\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^-} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]  
The total volume after adding NaOH is:  
\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]  
The concentrations are:  
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-} = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]  
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-}}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right),
\]  
where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73 \):  
\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log\left(\frac{0.005882}{0.017647}\right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.
\]

### Final Results
- At 25% titration, \( \text{pH} \approx 4.26 \).  
- At equivalence, \( \text{pH} \approx 8.52 \).  

These values match **Option A**.  

ANSWER: A
