Okay, so I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles in this decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, right, Pi is pion and nu is a neutrino. And the pion is at rest initially.

Hmm, the rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, but wait, neutrinos are super light, right? Like, for the purpose of these problems, sometimes they're considered massless. So maybe I can treat the neutrino's mass as zero. That would make things easier.

So when the pion is at rest, the decay products (muon and neutrino) will have some kinetic energy. But I think I need to apply conservation of energy and momentum here.

Let me think about the energy and momentum before and after the decay. Before decay, the pion is at rest, so its total energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. The momentum before decay is zero.

After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. And the total momentum should also be zero because the initial momentum was zero.

Let me denote the energies as E_mu and E_nu, and their momenta as p_mu and p_nu. Since neutrinos are (almost) massless, their energy E_nu is equal to their momentum magnitude times c, but since we're working in units where c=1, E_nu = |p_nu|.

Same for the muon: its energy is the total energy, which is rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. Wait, no, wait. The total energy of a particle is sqrt(p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4). But since we're in MeV units and using c=1, it's sqrt(p^2 + m^2), where m is in MeV/c², but when multiplied by c², but perhaps the units are handled so that energies are in MeV.

So for the muon, E_mu = sqrt(p_mu^2 + m_mu^2), where m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c². Since the neutrino is treated as massless, E_nu = p_nu.

Now, applying conservation of momentum: the vector sum of the momenta of muon and neutrino is zero. So p_mu + p_nu = 0. So p_mu = -p_nu. But since momentum is a vector, their magnitudes are the same but directions opposite.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, because the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p, say.

Wait, so p_mu = p and p_nu = -p, but their magnitudes are both p. Or perhaps p_mu is in one direction, and p_nu in the opposite.

So, the magnitudes are equal. So p_mu = |p_mu| = p, and p_nu = |p_nu| = p because their directions are opposite, so their vectors add to zero.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify: the vectors of the two momenta must cancel each other. So the muon's momentum is, say, +p in some direction, and the neutrino's is -p in that same direction. So their magnitudes are equal, but directions opposite.

So, p_mu = p, and p_nu = p. Wait, no, wait: vectorially, p_mu + p_nu = 0. So p_nu = - p_mu. So their magnitudes are the same: |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

Now, the energies: E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2), and E_nu = p (since m_nu is zero).

The total energy is E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV, because the pion was at rest, so its energy is 139.6 MeV.

So,

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, that's an equation with one unknown p. Let me write that as:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - p.

Now, I’ll square both sides to eliminate the square root.

p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expanding the right side:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 * p + p^2.

So,

p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p + p^2.

I can subtract p^2 from both sides:

105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 p.

Let me compute the squares:

105.7^2 = let's see, 100^2=10000, 5.7^2=32.49, and 2*100*5.7=1140. So (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 +32.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

139.6^2: Let me compute that. 140^2 is 19600, but 140-0.4=139.6. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

So plugging back in:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 * p.

Let me compute 2*139.6, which is 279.2.

So,

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 p.

Rearranging:

279.2 p = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49:

19488.16
-11172.49
=8315.67.

So,

279.2 p = 8315.67.

p = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that. 279.2 * 29 = ?

279.2 * 30 is 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. Let's see:

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 * 30 - 279.2 = 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8. Hmm, 8096.8 is less than 8315.67.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me approximate:

279.2 × 29.8 ≈ 279.2 ×30 = 8376, minus 279.2 ×0.2=55.84 → 8376 -55.84=8320.16.

Wait, that's very close to 8315.67. So 29.8 would give 8320.16. But we have 8315.67.

The difference is 8320.16 -8315.67=4.49.

So, 279.2 ×0.016 ≈4.467 (since 279.2 ×0.01=2.792, ×0.016=4.467).

So, 279.2 × (29.8 - 0.016) = 279.2 ×29.784 ≈8315.67.

Wait, perhaps I can do this division more accurately.

Compute 8315.67 divided by 279.2.

Well, 279.2 × 29 = 8096.8.

Subtract that from 8315.67: 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

Now, 218.87 /279.2 ≈ 0.782.

So p ≈29.782 MeV/c.

Wait, so p is approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

So E_nu = p = approx 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but the neutrino is massless, so its energy is equal to its momentum magnitude. So E_nu is about 29.78 MeV.

Now, E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) = let me compute that.

29.78^2 is approximately 886.8 (since 30^2=900, so 29.78 is a bit less).

105.7^2 is 11172.49.

So 886.8 + 11172.49 = 12059.29.

The square root of 12059.29 is around 109.83 MeV.

Wait, because 109.83^2 = (110 - 0.17)^2 ≈110^2 - 2*110*0.17 +0.17² ≈12100 - 37.4 +0.0289≈12062.63. Hmm, but our sum is 12059.29, so a bit less. So perhaps around 109.78 MeV.

Wait, but wait, let me compute this more accurately.

Let me compute 109.78^2:

= (109 + 0.78)^2 =109^2 + 2*109*0.78 + 0.78^2.

109^2=11881.

2*109*0.78= 2*109=218 *0.78= 218*(0.7 +0.08)=218*0.7=152.6, 218*0.08=17.44 → total 170.04.

0.78^2=0.6084.

So total: 11881 + 170.04 +0.6084 = 12051.6484.

But our sum is 12059.29, which is about 7.64 higher. So perhaps 109.78 + x.

Let’s estimate x: (109.78 + x)^2 ≈12059.29.

The derivative approximation: 2*109.78 *x ≈7.64 → x≈7.64/(2*109.78)=7.64/(219.56)=≈0.0348.

So E_mu ≈109.78 +0.0348 ≈109.814 MeV.

So E_mu is about 109.81 MeV.

Wait, but the total energy is E_mu + E_nu =109.81 +29.78 ≈139.59 MeV, which is close to the pion's rest mass of 139.6 MeV. So that checks out.

Now, but wait, the question is about the kinetic energies of the product particles.

The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy.

So for the muon: KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 MeV -105.7 MeV ≈4.11 MeV.

And the neutrino's KE is E_nu, since its rest mass is zero. So KE_nu =29.78 MeV.

So the two kinetic energies are approximately 4.11 MeV and 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D:4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

That's very close to our calculated values. So I think the correct answer is D.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations for any possible errors.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of p. Let me re-calculate that.

The equation after squaring was:

p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expanding the right side: 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 p + p^2.

Subtract p^2, both sides:

105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 p.

So,

105.7^2 =139.6^2 - 279.2 p.

So,

279.2 p =139.6^2 -105.7^2.

Compute 139.6^2 – 105.7^2.

Using the difference of squares: (139.6 +105.7)(139.6 –105.7)= (245.3)(33.9).

Compute 245.3 *33.9.

Let me compute that:

245 *33.9 = 245*(30 +3.9) = 245*30=7350, 245*3.9=955.5 → total 7350+955.5=8305.5.

Wait, but 245.3 is 245 + 0.3. So 0.3 *33.9=10.17.

So total is 8305.5 +10.17=8315.67.

So,

279.2 p =8315.67 → p=8315.67 / 279.2= let me compute that.

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.

8315.67 – 8096.8 =218.87.

218.87 /279.2 ≈0.782.

So p≈29.782 MeV/c.

So E_nu=29.782 MeV.

Then, E_mu = sqrt( (29.782)^2 + (105.7)^2 )= sqrt( 887 + 11172.49 )= sqrt(12059.49) ≈109.81 MeV.

So KE_mu=109.81 –105.7=4.11 MeV.

KE_nu=29.78 MeV.

So the options are:

D) 4.12 MeV,29.8 MeV → which matches closely. So answer D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay process **π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν**, we apply conservation of energy and momentum. The pion is initially at rest, so its total energy is its rest mass energy, **139.6 MeV**. The rest mass of the muon is **105.7 MeV**, while the neutrino is treated as massless.

### Conservation of Energy and Momentum
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy after the decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   For the muon, its total energy is given by:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2},
   \]
   where \(p\) is the magnitude of the muon's momentum, and \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\).  
   For the neutrino, since it is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum:  
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   The pion is initially at rest, so the total momentum after the decay must be zero. This implies that the magnitudes of the muon's and neutrino's momenta are equal:  
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} = p.
   \]

### Solving for \(p\)
Substituting \(E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2}\) and \(E_{\nu} = p\) into the energy conservation equation:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p = 139.6.
\]
Rearranging and squaring both sides:  
\[
p^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:  
\[
p^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2p + p^2.
\]
Canceling \(p^2\) and solving for \(p\):  
\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2p,
\]
\[
279.2p = 19488.16 - 11172.49,
\]
\[
279.2p = 8315.67,
\]
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Calculating Energies
1. **Neutrino Energy**:  
   Since \(E_{\nu} = p\), the neutrino's energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\nu} = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Muon Energy**:  
   The muon's energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2}.
   \]
   Compute \(29.78^2 \approx 886.8\) and \(105.7^2 = 11172.49\):  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{886.8 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.29} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Kinetic Energies
The kinetic energy of each particle is the total energy minus the rest mass energy:  
1. **Muon Kinetic Energy**:  
   \[
   KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
2. **Neutrino Kinetic Energy**:  
   \[
   KE_{\nu} = E_{\nu} = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately **4.11 MeV** and **29.78 MeV**, respectively. Comparing with the options:  
- **Option D**: \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV}\)  
matches closely.
