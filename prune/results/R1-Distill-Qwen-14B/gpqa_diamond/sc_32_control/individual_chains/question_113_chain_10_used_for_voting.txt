Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine the chemical formula of an unknown compound using the given spectral data. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the FTIR data: there's a very broad peak around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H stretch, so maybe that's a possibility. Also, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. The 1700 peak is typical of carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or maybe an acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might suggest conjugation or something like an aromatic ring or possibly an ester or amide. Hmm, but amides are less likely here because we might not have N in the formula, and the options don't suggest that.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond somewhere. That could be in a conjugated system, maybe with the carbonyl group.

Looking at the mass spectrum: a fragment at m/z 45. What could that be? 45 is a common fragment, maybe a ketone group losing some parts. Let me think. If it's a fragment like (CH3)2CO, that's a mass of 58 (since (CH3)2CO is 58 g/mol). Wait, no, 45. Oh, wait, 45 could be CH3CO+ (which is 43?), no, wait, 45 is the mass of CH3CO (45) but wait, 12+2*1 +16+12 (the carbonyl)? Hmm, maybe that's not it. Alternatively, a fragment like (CH2)2O? No, that's 44. Wait, maybe it's a CH3COOH group losing something? Not sure, but 45 is a key fragment, perhaps from an ester or a ketone.

Now, looking at the options:

A) C6H12O2: degrees of unsaturation? Let's calculate. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. For C6H12O2: (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So one DoU could be a ring or a double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is likely.

B) C6H10O: DoU is (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU, which could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a ring plus a carbonyl.

C) C6H10O2: DoU = (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. Two DoU. Maybe a carbonyl (like a ketone or ester) and a double bond.

D) C6H12O: DoU= (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU.

So, considering the NMR shows vinyl H, there's at least one double bond. So options B and C have two DoU, which could include a double bond and something else (like a carbonyl). A and D have only one DoU, which could be a ring or a single double bond.

The IR shows a carbonyl at 1700. Let's think: a ketone (around 1700-1750), ester (similar), or maybe an acid (lower, like 1700 could be possible). The peak at 1650 might be conjugated with the carbonyl, like an aromatic ring (as in an aromatic ketone or an ester attached to an aromatic ring, but not necessarily). Alternatively, it could be an amide, but the options don't seem to include nitrogen.

The broad IR at 3000 suggests O-H. So the compound might have an alcohol group or a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have a strong, broad O-H. If it's an ester, the O-H would be from an alcohol used in the esterification, but that's not part of the ester structure. So maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid. But wait, another possibility is a hemiacetal or something else, but that's less likely.

Looking at the options, which have O and O2.

If the compound is a carboxylic acid, then the formula would have at least one O. Let's see the options. For example, if it's a carboxylic acid, the formula would be CnH2nO2, but let's check:

Wait, the general formula for a carboxylic acid is CnH2nO2. So for example, if n=3, it's C3H6O2, but our options are for C6.

Looking at the options, option A is C6H12O2. That would fit a cyclohexane carboxylic acid, for example. The formula would be C6H11COOH, which is C7H12O2. Wait, no, that's more carbons. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or a ketone with an alcohol group.

Wait, perhaps the compound is an ester. Esters have the formula R-O-CO-R'. So for an ester, the formula would be CnH2nO2. Wait, for example, ethyl acetate is C4H8O2. So if our formula is C6H12O2 (option A), that would fit an ester.

But let me think about the NMR. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond, so the ester might be something like methyl propenoate. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester, a lactone, which would have a ring and a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a ketone with an ether group or something else.

Wait, the NMR has vinyl H, so a double bond, which is one degree of unsaturation. The carbonyl is another (if it's a ketone), so that's two DoU. Let's see which options have two DoU.

Options B and C have two DoU. Let me look:

Option B: C6H10O. So two DoU. That could be a carbonyl and a double bond. But the formula is C6H10O. If it's a ketone with an alcohol, like cyclohexanone with an OH group, but that would be C6H10O2, not O. So maybe not.

Alternatively, it's an aldehyde with a double bond. But aldehydes are usually less likely because they're reactive.

Option C: C6H10O2. Two DoU. So perhaps a carbonyl and a double bond. For example, an ester with a double bond, like methyl vinyl acetate or something similar. Or maybe a di-ester, but that's less likely.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU=1. So either a ring or a double bond. But the NMR shows a double bond, so perhaps a ring plus a double bond. Wait, that would require more DoU. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the DoU is calculated for the entire molecule. Each ring or double bond counts as one. So for option A: (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or one double bond.

But the NMR shows vinyl H, which implies a double bond. So if option A has only one DoU, that's a double bond or a ring. But a molecule with a double bond and nothing else would have DoU=1. So that fits.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl H, which suggests a double bond. So if the molecule has a double bond, then DoU is at least 1. So options A and D have DoU 1, which could support a single double bond.

But then, the IR shows 1700, which could be a carbonyl. So that would add another DoU. Wait, but if the compound has a carbonyl group, that's another DoU. So if the molecule has both a double bond and a carbonyl, that's two DoU, which would require the formula to have two DoU.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl. So the compound has a carbonyl group, which is a double bond (O=C-O, etc.), so that's one DoU. The vinyl H is another DoU. So total of two DoU.

That would mean the molecular formula must have two DoU. So let's check the options:

Option A: DoU=1 → only one DoU. So can't have both a carbonyl and a double bond unless it's something else.

Option B: DoU=2 → possible, but the formula is C6H10O. Wait, O is 1. So, but a carbonyl (like a ketone) would require another O. So maybe not.

Option C: DoU=2 (because (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2), and O is 2. So that fits: a carbonyl (like an ester) and a double bond.

Option D: DoU=1 → so only one DoU. So if the molecule has a carbonyl (another DoU), that's not possible unless it's a conjugated system, but the formula can't have two DoU.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. The compound has a carbonyl group (maybe an ester, ketone, acid) and a double bond (from the vinyl H). So that's two DoU in the molecule.

Which options have two DoU?

Options B and C.

Option B: C6H10O → DoU=2. O is 1. So if the molecule has a carbonyl, that would require O=2 (since a carbonyl is O). But option B has O=1. So that's a problem. So option B can't have a carbonyl group because it only has one O.

Option C: C6H10O2 → DoU=2. That's good because a carbonyl (O=2 used in CO and another O somewhere else. So for example, an ester has two O in the formula.

So perhaps the compound is an ester with a double bond. Like maybe methyl propenoate or something similar.

Now, looking at the mass spectrum fragment at m/z=45. What could that be? 45 is the mass of (CH3)CO+ (which is 58? No wait, CH3CO+ is 43, because 12+1*3 +16= 43). Wait, 45 could be a fragment like CH3COO+ which would be 60? No, that's 60. Hmmm.

Alternatively, 45 could be the fragment from the ester group. For example, in ethyl acetate (CH3COOCH2CH3), the molecular ion is 88. A common fragment is the acetyl group (CH3CO+) which is 43. But wait, 43 isn't 45. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's the (CH2)2CO+? No, that would be 58, which is higher. Alternatively, perhaps it's a fragment from the ester group where the ester oxygen breaks, leading to a carbonyl group. For example, in methyl propionate, the structure is CH2CH2COOCH3. If it breaks, maybe the fragment is CH2CH2CO (which would be C3H4O?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, thinking about the molecular formula. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, with two DoU (so a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a double bond and a carbonyl), but since IR shows a carbonyl, it's a double bond and a carbonyl.

Another approach: the molecular formula possibilities.

Looking for a compound that has a carbonyl group (from the IR peaks), an O-H (broad peak at 3000), a double bond (vinyl H in NMR), and a mass fragment at 45.

Wait, could it be a hemiacetal or something else? Not sure.

Alternatively, if the compound is a beta-keto ester. For example, something like ethyl acetoacetate. Its structure is CH3COCH2COOEt. But the molecular formula would be C5H8O3, which is more O than the options. So that's not applicable.

Another thought: the fragment at 45. Let me think of possible structures. 45 could be CH3COOCH2 (which is part of an ester). Wait, but that's 45? Let me see: CH3COO- is 60 (12*2 +16*2+ 1*3 = 2*12=24, 2*16=32, 3*1=3; total 24+32+3=59? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl. Not sure.

Alternatively, 45 could be the loss of a larger fragment. For example, if the molecular ion is broken down, and a part is lost. Hmm.

Alternatively, if the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone), then the structure would have a ring. That could explain the DoU. The mass fragment at 45 might come from the ring opening.

But not sure. Let me try to think about the options again.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU=1. So a ring or a double bond.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl H, so a double bond. So in this case, the DoU would be 1 from the double bond and another from the carbonyl, which would make total DoU=2. But the formula only allows DoU=1. So that's a problem. Unless the carbonyl is part of the same DoU as the double bond, like in conjugation. Wait, but a carbonyl is a double bond itself. So if the molecule has a conjugated system, like an enone (double bond conjugated to a carbonyl), that would count as one DoU for the double bond and another for the carbonyl, making two DoU. But the formula for option A (DoU=1) can't accommodate that.

So option A is less likely because the data suggests two DoU.

Option C: DoU=2. So that can handle a carbonyl and a double bond.

So, the formula would be C6H10O2. Possible structures: for example, a di-substituted ester with a double bond. Like methyl vinyl benzoate? Wait, but that's C9H8O2. Hmm, no. Alternatively, something like methyl propenoate, which is CH2CHCOOCH3 (structure: CH2=CHCOOCH3). Its formula is C5H8O2. But the options are for C6.

Wait, perhaps it's a longer chain. For example, diethyl maleate? That's a diester with a conjugated diene, but the formula would be C8H12O4, which doesn't match any options here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester with a double bond, like methyl hex-2-enoate. Structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2COOCH3. Formula: C7H10O2. But our option is C6, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible functional groups.

The IR has a very broad peak at 3000, which is O-H, likely from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But the presence of a carbonyl (1700) suggests it's more likely an ester or ketone with an alcohol group. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad, and the carbonyl would be around 1700.

But if the formula is C6H10O2 (option C), could it be a diacid? No, because the O would be two, but diacid would have two COOH groups, which would be O4. So not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic hemiacetal, but that's getting too complicated.

Wait, another thought: the FTIR shows a strong peak at 1700 and 1650. 1700 is a carbonyl, 1650 could be an aromatic ring (C=C). So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl and an aromatic ring. But the options don’t have aromatic rings, perhaps.

Wait, but the options are all aliphatic. Let me think again.

The mass spectrum fragment at 45. Let me think of what could give a m/z of 45. The molecular formula is C6H10O2. The molecular weight would be (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16)=72+10+32=114. So the molecular ion would be around 114. The fragment at 45 is about 40% of the molecular weight.

45 is the mass of (CH3)CO+ (which is 43). Wait, so 43 isn't 45. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2CO+ which would be 43 again. Hmm.

Or, perhaps it's a fragment that includes the carbonyl group. For example, if the molecule is an ester like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2O... No, that might not.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diethyl acetyl ester or something. But I'm not getting it.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about the possible structure. If the compound has a carbonyl group and a double bond, and an O-H group.

If the formula is C6H10O2, what structures fit?

One possibility is a beta-keto ester. For example, ethyl acetoacetate is CH3COCH2COOEt. But its formula is C5H8O3, which doesn't match C6H10O2. So perhaps a longer chain. Maybe CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2COOH? No, that would have more O.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexene ring with an ester group. For example, cyclohexene attached to an ester. But I'm not sure about the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted acrylic acid ester. Let's say, an ester with a vinyl group.

Wait, another idea: the molecular formula C6H10O2 could be something like methyl vinyl carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone. So a six-membered ring lactone would have a structure like (CH2)4COO, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the broad O-H peak in IR could be from an alcohol group. So in the structure, there's an -OH group and a carbonyl group, along with a double bond.

If the formula is C6H10O2, that would fit a structure like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH2OH. Wait, but that's more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with substituents, but the options don't suggest aromatic compounds.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let's try to summarize:

- IR: O-H (broad, so maybe alcohol or acid), carbonyl at 1700, and another peak at 1650 (possibly conjugated double bond or aromatic).

- NMR: vinyl H, so a double bond.

- Mass: fragment at 45.

The possible functional groups are a carbonyl (ester, ketone, acid), an O-H group (alcohol, acid), and a double bond.

Looking at the options:

Only option C has two DoU and two O atoms, which could support a carbonyl and another O-containing group.

So, let's think of option C: C6H10O2.

Possible structure: an ester with a double bond. For example, methyl 3-pentenoate. Structure: CH2CHCOOCH3. Formula: C5H8O2. But we need C6.

Hmm. Maybe it's something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. That would be ethyl allyl carbonate? Wait, no, that would be C6H10O2. Wait, structure: CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. Let's count: CH2=CHCH2 is three carbons, COO is two, and CH2CH3 is two. So that's 3 + 2 + 2 =7? No, that's more. Alternatively, perhaps it's a shorter chain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a diethyl maleate, but that's diester with four carbons in the diene. Wait, but the formula is C8H12O4, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a substituted acrylate. For example, methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Its formula is C4H6O2. But we need C6H10O2. So maybe adding more carbons.

Wait, maybe it's ethyl 3-pentenoate. Structure: CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. Let's count: CH2=CHCH2 (3C), COO (2C), CH2CH3 (2C). So 3+2+2=7C. No, but the formula is C6. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ring structure. Like a cyclopentene ester. But not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group. But not sure.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula is C6H10O2 and the structure is a di-ester or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted phenyl group, but I think the options don't include aromatic structures.

Wait, perhaps it's an ortho ester, but that's probably not the case.

So, putting it all together: the IR suggests a carbonyl and O-H (like an alcohol or acid). The NMR shows a double bond. The mass fragment is 45.

Option C's formula fits two DoU, which would allow a carbonyl and a double bond. And the O count is two, which could be from an ester (O2) and an alcohol (O1), but that would require three O's, which doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, maybe the compound is a beta-hydroxy ester, which would have both an alcohol group and an ester.

But I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the mass again.

If the molecular weight is 114 (C6H10O2: 6*12=72, 10*1=10, 2*16=32 → 72+10+32=114), and the fragment is at 45, which is about 40% of the molecular weight. 45 is about 40% of 114, which is roughly.

What could be lost to give m/z 45? Maybe the molecule loses a fragment of 69 (114-45=69). But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the ester group. For example, if the ester oxygen breaks, the acylium ion (R-CO-O-) could form, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: possible structures that fit the formula C6H10O2 with IR and NMR data.

Another possibility: the compound is a cyclic ester, a lactone, which would have a ring. For example, a six-membered ring lactone (gamma-lactone would be five-membered). Suppose the structure is a gamma-butyrolactone derivative, but that's four carbons. So maybe a larger ring. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think of what the correct answer is likely to be.

The FTIR shows a broad O-H, which suggests either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. The carbonyl is at 1700, which is typical for esters or ketones. The presence of vinyl H in NMR implies an alkene. The mass fragment at 45 could be the acetyl group (CH3CO+ is 43, but 45 is close), but perhaps it's a different fragment.

If the compound is an ester with an alcohol group, like a glycolic ester, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diethyl maleate, but that's more carbons.

Wait, another thought: The IR has a peak at 1650, which could be C=C in conjugation with the carbonyl, suggesting an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. That would be a conjugated system, which would fit with the vinyl H in NMR.

So, if the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, for example, methyl acrylate (CH2=CHCOOCH3), which has formula C4H6O2. But our formula is C6H10O2. So perhaps a longer chain.

So, perhaps the structure is something like CH2CH=CHCOOCH2CH3. Let's count the carbons: 2 (CH2CH=CH) + 2 (COO) + 2 (CH2CH3) → total 6 carbons. So that's C6H10O2. Yes! That fits.

So the structure would be methyl vinyl ester or similar.

In that case, the molecular formula is C6H10O2, which is option C.

The mass fragment at 45 could come from the acylium ion, like the (CH2CH=CHCOO-) losing the ester part, leaving CH2CH=CHCOO- which might fragment into a smaller ion. Alternatively, the (CH2CH=CH) group could fragment, but not sure.

So putting it all together, the correct formula is C6H10O2, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The unknown compound is characterized using FTIR, $^1$H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm$^{-1}$, indicative of an O-H group (likely an alcohol or carboxylic acid). Strong absorption peaks at 1700 cm$^{-1}$ and 1650 cm$^{-1}$ suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated system (e.g., C=C). The $^1$H NMR spectrum includes peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, indicating the presence of a double bond. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45, which is consistent with a common fragment involving a carbonyl group.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: C$_6$H$_{12}$O$_2$**  
   - Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 1.  
   - This formula allows for either a ring or a double bond. However, the NMR data indicates the presence of a double bond, and the IR data suggests a carbonyl group, which would require two DoU. Thus, this option is inconsistent with the spectral data.

2. **Option B: C$_6$H$_{10}$O**  
   - DoU = 2.  
   - This formula could accommodate a carbonyl group and a double bond. However, the formula only contains one oxygen atom, which is insufficient to account for the carbonyl group (C=O) and the O-H group observed in the IR spectrum. Therefore, this option is also inconsistent with the data.

3. **Option C: C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_2$**  
   - DoU = 2.  
   - This formula allows for both a carbonyl group and a double bond, consistent with the IR and NMR data. The two oxygen atoms can account for the O-H group and the carbonyl group. The mass fragment at m/z = 45 is also consistent with a fragment involving the carbonyl group. This option fits all the spectral data.

4. **Option D: C$_6$H$_{12}$O**  
   - DoU = 1.  
   - This formula allows for either a ring or a double bond. However, similar to Option A, it cannot account for the two DoU required by the spectral data (one for the carbonyl group and one for the double bond). Thus, this option is inconsistent with the data.

### Conclusion:
The spectral data (FTIR, $^1$H NMR, and mass spectrometry) are most consistent with the formula **C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_2$**, which corresponds to an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester or a related structure. This formula satisfies the degrees of unsaturation, accounts for the observed functional groups, and aligns with the mass fragment at m/z = 45.
