Okay, so I've got this question about a transmission electron microscope and the mean free path of gas molecules in its vacuum chamber. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, the setup: Mike is using a high-resolution TEM with an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV. He's got vacuum pumps creating an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. So, the idea is to minimize gas molecules because they can interfere with the electron beam. But some gas particles are still there, and the mass spectrometer detected them.

Mike determined the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the volume of the compartment. So, higher pressure would mean more collisions, shorter mean free path. Lower pressure, longer mean free path.

Wait, but when he starts the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ2, which is different from λ1. The temperature is the same, so it's not that. What else could affect the mean free path?

Oh, right! The electron beam itself. When the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might interact with it. But how? Well, the electrons in the beam could cause scattering with the gas atoms or molecules. So, the electron beam is introducing another factor that affects the mean free path.

Mean free path is calculated using the formula λ = 1/(√2 n π d²), where n is the number density of the gas and d is the collision diameter. But if the electrons are also causing collisions, that would increase the effective number of collisions. So, the mean free path would be shorter than before.

Wait, but wait. In the initial state (without the electron beam), the mean free path is λ1. When the beam is on, the electrons could cause the gas molecules to ionize or scatter. But wait, in an electron beam, the electrons are moving at high speeds. If the gas is present, each time an electron hits a gas molecule, that's an additional collision, right?

So, the presence of the electron beam adds more scattering events for the gas molecules. That means each gas molecule now has more chances to collide, not just with each other but also with the electrons. So the mean free path λ2 should be shorter than λ1 because the effective collision rate is higher.

So, λ2 is less than λ1. Looking at the options, option C says λ2 < λ1. That seems correct.

But wait, could there be any other factors? Like, does the electron beam somehow affect the gas pressure? Well, if the beam is causing gas molecules to be knocked out of the chamber, that could lower the pressure, which would increase the mean free path. But the problem states that the sample compartment's temperature remained the same, so if the pressure were lower, the mean free path would be higher. But in that case, Mike would have noticed a change in pressure, but the question says he accurately determined λ1 based on factors like pressure. So maybe the pressure isn't changing, but the effective collisions are increasing due to the electron beam.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to move or ionize, but the main effect on the mean free path would be more collisions. So, λ2 should be smaller than λ1.

So the correct answer should be option C: λ2 < λ1.

The scenario involves a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating under ultra-high vacuum conditions (< 10^-9 Torr). Mike determined the mean free path of gas molecules in the vacuum chamber as λ1 based on factors such as pressure, temperature, and compartment volume. However, upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path changed to λ2, despite the temperature remaining constant.

The mean free path is influenced by the number of collisions a gas molecule undergoes. Initially, in the absence of the electron beam, the mean free path is λ1. When the electron beam is activated, the high-energy electrons in the beam can interact with the gas molecules, introducing additional scattering events. This increases the effective collision rate for the gas molecules, leading to a shorter mean free path. Therefore, λ2 is shorter than λ1.

Given the options:
- **A)** λ2 ≥ 1.22λ1: This is incorrect because the electron beam reduces the mean free path, not increases it.
- **B)** λ2 = λ1: This is incorrect because the presence of the electron beam alters the mean free path due to additional collisions.
- **C)** λ2 < λ1: This is correct because the electron beam introduces additional scattering events, shortening the mean free path.
- **D)** λ1 < λ2 < 1.22λ1: This is incorrect because the mean free path decreases, not increases, when the electron beam is applied.

Thus, the correct conclusion is that λ2 < λ1.
