Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me read it again.

The question says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? They also mention the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, right? So the complex is CaEDTA²⁻, I think. Calcium EDTA is a stable complex, so the formation constant is given as 5e10, which is a large number, meaning the complex is very stable.

The solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, I think that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But wait, the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions. Because the complex dissociates a little bit, I suppose, so the free Ca²+ concentration would be really low.

I recall that the formation constant K is given by the formula:

K = [CaEDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²+][EDTA⁴⁻])

Wait, but wait, I think I might have it backwards. Because the formation of the complex is Ca²+ + EDTA⁴- ⇌ CaEDTA²−. So the formation constant K is [CaEDTA²−]/( [Ca²+][EDTA⁴-] )

But in this problem, we have the concentration of the complex as 0.02 M. And we're assuming that the pH is ideal, which probably means that the concentration of EDTA⁴− is high enough, but wait, under ideal pH conditions for EDTA, the alpha fraction of EDTA in the Y⁴− form is 1. So [EDTA⁴−] is just the total EDTA concentration.

Wait, but wait, in this solution, the only EDTA present is part of the complex. Unless the solution is prepared with some free EDTA, but the problem says it's 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the total concentration of EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex.

Hmm, so let me think. The solution has 0.02 M CaEDTA²−. Let me denote this as [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M.

The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA⁴−, but only a tiny bit because K is so large. So the amount of dissociation would be very small, so the concentration of free Ca²+ would be [Ca²+] = x, and [EDTA⁴−] = x as well.

Wait, but that's assuming that the EDTA comes only from the dissociation of the complex. Because initially, if the solution is just 0.02 M CaEDTA²−, and it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA⁴−, then each mole of complex gives one mole of each ion. But since K is so big, the dissociation is minimal, so x is very small.

So let's write the expression:

K = [CaEDTA²−]/( [Ca²+][EDTA⁴−] )

We have K = 5e10.

We can denote [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA⁴−] = x as well, because each comes one per complex. So substituting:

5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) → 5e10 = 0.02 / x²

Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 2e-3 / 5e10 → Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6. So 2e-6? Wait, no, wait 4e-13 → sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6, so 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7. Oh, that's option C.

Wait, let me recheck:

K = 5e10 = 0.02/(x^2)

So x^2 = 0.02 / 5e10 = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. So 2e-6.5 is 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M. So it's approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, the solution is 0.02 M in the CaEDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. When it dissociates, the concentration of Ca²+ is x, which is much less than 0.02, so [CaEDTA²−] is approximately 0.02 M. So our assumption holds.

Another way: Let's model the dissociation.

Let’s let the dissociation be:

CaEDTA²− ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA⁴−.

Initially, [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M, [Ca²+] = 0, [EDTA⁴−] = 0.

At equilibrium, [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is tiny), [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA⁴−] = x.

So the K expression is:

K = [Ca²+][EDTA⁴−] / [CaEDTA²−] = (x^2)/(0.02) = 5e10.

Wait wait, no! Wait, wait, I think I got the expression wrong earlier. Because the K is for the formation of the complex. So the formation is:

Ca²+ + EDTA⁴− ⇌ CaEDTA²−.

So the formation constant is K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴−]).

So when the complex dissociates, the reverse reaction. The dissociation K would be 1/K_form, but since K_form is given, the dissociation K is 1/(5e10), which is a very small number. So when the complex dissociates, the product of [Ca²+][EDTA⁴−] would be [CaEDTA²−] × (1/(5e10)).

Wait, maybe I confused the approach earlier. Let me re-express.

At equilibrium,

[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02

[Ca²+] = x

[EDTA⁴−] = x

So, the K for formation is 5e10 = [CaEDTA²−]/(x^2)

So, 5e10 = (0.02)/(x^2)

Which gives x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) = 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 6.32e-7 M.

So that's about 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

So the answer must be option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

### Step 1: Simplify the equilibrium expression
The solution contains 0.02 M CaEDTA²⁻, and the dissociation of the complex is minimal due to the large formation constant (\(K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10}\)). Thus, at equilibrium:
- \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\),
- \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x\),
- \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\).

Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \(x\)
Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
\]

\[
x \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 3: Interpret the result
The concentration of calcium ions (\([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\)) is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.
