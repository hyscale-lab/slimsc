Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about electron microscopy and the mean free path of gas molecules in the vacuum. Hmm, I remember that mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. Right.

So Mike has a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. But some gas particles are still there, detected by a mass spectrometer. He determined the mean free path as λ1. But when he starts the electron beam, the mean free path becomes λ2, which is different from λ1. Temperature stayed the same, so why the change?

Wait, what affects the mean free path? I think it's related to pressure and temperature. Oh wait, but the pressure is the same because the vacuum state hasn't changed. Or wait, no. Because when the electron beam is on, maybe the gas gets excited or ionized. Oh, because the electron beam has high energy. Could it be that the electrons are causing the gas molecules to ionize, which would change their behavior?

Ionization would increase the number of ions and electrons in the compartment. But how does that affect the mean free path? Well, more charged particles would mean more interactions. So the mean free path might decrease because there's more scattering events. Oh wait, but wait: the mean free path is inversely proportional to the number density of the gas. So if the number of particles increases, the mean free path decreases. But wait, the initial λ1 was calculated under normal vacuum conditions, assuming neutral gas molecules.

If the electron beam is causing ionization, that introduces more charged particles. Wait, but wait: when gas molecules ionize, they become ions, which would have a charge. Do these ions affect the mean free path? Because charged particles would interact more with the electron beam, but how does that affect the gas's own mean free path? Or perhaps, the presence of ions increases the effective pressure? Or maybe the electrons from the beam are causing more collisions between gas molecules.

Alternatively, when the beam is on, the gas molecules might be more likely to collide with the electrons, but wait, the mean free path is for the gas particles. So, if the gas molecules are being ionized, that could cause more electron-molecule interactions, but how does that impact the mean free path of the gas particles (the λ for scattering among themselves)?

Wait, perhaps when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are more likely to be ionized, which would cause them to have more interactions. But wait, the mean free path is for scattering between gas molecules, not with the beam electrons. Or is the mean free path considering scattering with both the walls and other gas particles?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think again. The mean free path λ is given by λ = 1/(nσ), where n is the number density and σ is the collision cross-section. So if n increases, λ decreases. But in this case, n is the same because the pressure hasn't changed, right? Because the vacuum pumps are maintaining the same ultra-high vacuum. So n is the same. So why would λ change? Unless σ changes.

Oh, because when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might be more likely to interact in a way that changes their cross-section. Wait, but the cross-section σ is for collisions between gas molecules. If the electron beam causes the gas to ionize, then the gas molecules might have more charge, leading to more interactions (like Coulomb interactions) between them. So σ would increase, leading to a decrease in λ.

Alternatively, wait: when the gas is neutral, the dominant scattering is via elastic collisions. When ionized, perhaps the ions have a larger effective cross-section due to their charge. So each collision between gas particles (now ions) would have a higher probability, thus a lower mean free path.

So in the presence of the electron beam, the gas becomes ionized, leading to a higher σ. Hence, λ would be smaller than λ1. So λ2 < λ1. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe the electron beam is causing more gas molecules to be in motion, which might actually increase the number density n. But I thought n is based on pressure, which is the same. Unless the beam somehow heats the gas, increasing temperature. Oh, but the temperature remained the same according to the problem statement. So n remains the same.

So only σ could change. If σ increases, λ decreases. So λ2 is less than λ1. So option C.

The mean free path (λ) of gas molecules is determined by the number density (n) and the collision cross-section (σ), as given by the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{n \sigma}
\]

In the scenario described, the ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) ensures that the number density (n) of gas molecules remains constant, as the pressure does not change. However, upon initiating the electron beam, Mike observes a change in the mean free path from λ1 to λ2. This suggests that the collision cross-section (σ) has changed.

When the electron beam is turned on, the high-energy electrons can ionize the gas molecules. Ionization introduces charged particles (ions) into the system. Charged particles interact more strongly with each other due to Coulomb forces, effectively increasing the collision cross-section (σ). A larger σ reduces the mean free path (λ) because gas molecules collide more frequently. Since the temperature remains constant, the number density (n) does not change, and the only factor affecting λ is the increase in σ.

Thus, the mean free path λ2 is smaller than λ1, as the ionized gas molecules experience more frequent collisions due to their increased cross-section. Therefore, the correct conclusion is:

**λ2 < λ1**
