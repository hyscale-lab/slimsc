Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, so the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that when dealing with relative speeds in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like you would in classical mechanics. There's a specific formula for adding velocities relativistically. Oh right, the formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Wait, since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed of the first with respect to the second would be v1 - v2, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. If astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction, then from A's frame, what's B's speed? Or is it the other way around? Oh, right, the problem says "relative speed," which I think is the speed of one as seen from the other. So, if we're considering the speed of the second astronaut (0.5c) as seen from the first astronaut (0.6c), the relative speed would be (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v2 v1)/(c²)) ), but since v1 is larger, maybe I should compute it as (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²).

Wait, no, wait. Let's think about the direction. Let me clarify. The formula for velocity addition in relativity is: if object 1 is moving at u in the lab frame, and object 2 is moving at v in the lab frame, then the speed of object 2 relative to object 1 is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Because from object 1's frame, the lab is moving at u, so object 2, which is at speed v in the lab, would be at (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)) in object 1's frame.

Wait, but in our case, both are moving in the same direction, so if I'm looking at astronaut B's speed from astronaut A's perspective, then it's (vB - vA) / [1 - (vA vB)/(c²)]. Wait, no, wait. Wait, astronaut A's speed in the lab is vA = 0.6c, and astronaut B's speed is vB = 0.5c. So from A's frame, B's speed is (vB - vA) / (1 - (vA vB)/(c²)).

Wait, but if vA is 0.6c and vB is 0.5c, then vB - vA is negative, so this would give a negative relative speed, but since speed can't be negative, perhaps I should take the absolute value. Alternatively, maybe I should have the formula as (u' = (v - u)/(1 - vu/c²)), where u is the speed of the frame, and v is the speed of the object in the lab frame. So in this case, the relative speed of B as seen from A would be (vB - vA)/(1 - (vA vB)/(c²)). But since vB is less than vA, that would give a negative number, which I guess would indicate direction. So the magnitude would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)) ) = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c, which is about 0.14c.

Wait, let me calculate that. 0.6c minus 0.5c is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) ) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 = (1/7) c ≈ 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed between them would be 0.14c. So looking at the options, the possible relative speeds are 1.1c, 0.1c, 0.14c, 0.14c. So option C and D have 0.14c. 

Now, the other part is the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has their own relativistic energy, and the total energy would be the sum of their energies. The relativistic energy equation is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) )= 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c), gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) )=1/sqrt(1-0.25)=1/sqrt(0.75)= approx 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 *3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2 gives 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². Which is approximately 5.96 m c². So looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and relative speed 0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc² which is lower.

So the correct option should be C: relative speed 0.14c, energy 5.96 mc².

To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of one object as seen from another in special relativity is given by:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**.
