Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to electrostatics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The setup is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R, and there's a small cavity inside. The cavity's radius is r, and its center is a distance s from the conductor's center. So s must be less than R because the cavity is entirely inside the conductor. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity.

The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. Also, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are all formulas involving these variables. I need to figure out which one gives the correct E.

I remember from my studies that when dealing with conductors and their charges, there are some key concepts. First, if a conductor is neutral, any charges placed inside a cavity will induce charges on the inner surface. But wait, this conductor is initially uncharged, so when you place +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will develop an induced charge of -q. Then, since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have a +q charge.

But wait, no. Wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. So when you put +q inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface will have -q, and the outer surface will have +q, making the total charge of the conductor zero again (since it started as uncharged). So the outer surface effectively has +q.

But what about the electric field outside the conductor? I remember that when a charge is inside a cavity, the external field only depends on the outer charges. Because the conductor shields the interior, right? So outside the conductor, the field should be as if all the charge were at the center, due to the shell theorem. Wait, but in this case, the conductor itself has +q on the outside. So the field outside would be the same as if a point charge +q were at the center of the sphere.

Wait, but point P is outside the conductor, at a distance L from the conductor's center. So the electric field at P is due to the outer charge, which is +q. So the field should be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L², because that's the field from a point charge outside a conducting shell.

But looking at the options, option B is exactly that: q/(4πε₀ L²). So perhaps the answer is option B.

But wait, I need to think again. The conductor's outer surface has charge +q, but it's distributed spherically symmetrically, right? Because the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface charge would arrange itself uniformly. Therefore, the electric field outside would be as if the charge were concentrated at the center.

But wait, in this problem, the charge +q was placed inside the cavity, which is offset from the center. So the inner surface would have an induced -q, but the outer surface would have +q. However, the outer surface's charge distribution would still be uniform because the conductor is a sphere. So the field outside should only depend on the total outer charge.

Wait, but some people might think that the position of the charge inside the cavity affects the external field. But I remember that the external field of a spherical conductor depends only on the total charge outside the point, not on internal charges. So, in this case, the external field at point P (outside the conductor) would be the same as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor.

Alternatively, if the conductor wasn't spherical, the external field might be more complicated, but since it's a sphere, the field outside is the same as a point charge.

Wait, but the position of the charge inside the cavity: does that matter? Because the conductor is a conductor, the charges on the outer surface are induced in such a way that the field inside the conductor (but outside the cavity) is zero. So, the field inside the conductor is zero, and the external field would only be due to the outer charge, which is +q.

So, the electric field at P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², which is option B.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is exactly that. So that must be the correct answer.

But wait, some of the other options involve combinations of l and s and the angle theta. Hmm. Why would the position of the cavity's center (s) affect the field at P? Because point P is outside the conductor, and the conductor's outer surface's induced charge is uniform, so the position of the charge inside the cavity (i.e., how close it is to the center or not) doesn't change the external field. The external field depends solely on the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q.

Therefore, the answer should be option B.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small cavity of radius $r$ inside it. The cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$, where $s < R$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The question asks for the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is initially uncharged, the outer surface of the conductor must develop a charge of $+q$ to maintain charge neutrality. The electric field outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, not on the position of the charge inside the cavity. Due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor, the outer surface charge distributes uniformly, and the electric field outside the conductor behaves as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.

At point $P$, which is outside the conductor, the electric field is therefore determined solely by the total charge on the outer surface ($+q$) and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. Using Coulomb's law, the electric field is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This matches option B. The other options involving $l$, $s$, and $\theta$ are incorrect because the position of the cavity or the angle $\theta$ does not affect the electric field outside the conductor, which depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance $L$.

Answer: B
