Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Okay, let's read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is asking for the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. They give the components P_x, P_y, and P_z as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2 each.

Hmm, wait. So the operator P is a vector operator, right? So it's like a vector made up of P_x, P_y, P_z. So the operator we're looking at is probably the dot product of this vector operator with another vector n, which is in the x-z plane. Because the direction is arbitrary in x-z, the operator along n would be P · n, which is n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in x-z, y-component of n is zero. So the operator along n is n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But wait, the question is about the eigenvector of P along direction n. So, we're dealing with the operator (P · n), which is Pn = n_x P_x + n_z P_z, right?

Because n lies in the x-z plane, n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). And since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So the operator Pn is given by (n_x * P_x) + (n_z * P_z). Each component P_x, P_z is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me write down the given matrices:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, substituting the matrices, Pn becomes:

Pn = (n_x * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]) + (n_z * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]])

I can factor out ħ/2:

Pn = (ħ/2) [n_z * [[1, 0],[0, -1]] + n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] ]

So that's (ħ/2) times [ [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] ]

Wait, let me do the matrix multiplication again:

n_x * P_x is (ħ/2) [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]]
n_z * P_z is (ħ/2) [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]
Adding them together: (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

So the matrix part is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

So Pn = (ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

We are to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So we set up the equation:

Pn |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

So,

(ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Divide both sides by ħ/2:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * |ψ> = |ψ>

So, the matrix equation is:

[ n_z  n_x ] [a]   = [a]
[ n_x -n_z ] [b]     [b]

This gives the system of equations:

n_z a + n_x b = a
n_x a - n_z b = b

Let me write that as:

n_z a + n_x b = a   --> equation (1)
n_x a - n_z b = b   --> equation (2)

Let's rearrange equation (1):

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0

Similarly, equation (2):

n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0

So we have two equations:

(n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0   --> eq (1)
n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0   --> eq (2)

We can write this as a homogeneous system:

[ (n_z -1)   n_x       ] [a]   = 0
[ n_x      -(n_z +1) ] [b]      = 0

For non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero.

Calculating the determinant:

D = (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) - (n_x)^2

Let me expand this:

D = -(n_z -1)(n_z +1) - n_x²
= -(n_z² -1) - n_x²
= -n_z² +1 -n_x²

But since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² =1. So substitute:

D = -(n_z²) +1 - (1 -n_z²) [since n_x²=1 -n_z²]
Wait, wait, more accurately:

n_x² + n_z² =1 → n_x² = 1 -n_z².

So substitution:

D = -(n_z²) +1 - (1 - n_z²)
= -n_z² +1 -1 +n_z² = 0.

So determinant is zero, which is consistent because we have nontrivial solutions.

So the equations are dependent. Let's consider equation (1):

(n_z -1) a + n_x b =0 → let's solve for a in terms of b.

(n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b

Wait, but that denominator could be zero if n_z=1, which would mean n is in the z-direction (since n_x=0). Hmm, but we need to handle that case.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the ratio a/b.

From equation (1):

a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b

Assuming (n_z -1) is not zero.

So the eigenvector can be written as a =k * something, and b =k * something else. But to find the ratio, perhaps I can express a in terms of b.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of spherical coordinates. Since n is in the x-z plane, let me parametrize n as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

Wait, no, wait. Since n is in x-z plane, perhaps θ is the angle from the z-axis, so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Wait, no, wait. Depends on convention. Typically, for a direction in x-z, θ would be the angle measured from the z-axis towards x. So, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Wait, wait: unit vector in x-z plane can be written as (n_x, 0, n_z), where n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. So if we let θ be the polar angle from z-axis, then n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So that's probably the parametrization. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So substituting into equation (1):

(n_z -1) a + n_x b =0 → (cosθ -1) a + (sinθ) b =0

Equation (2):

n_x a - (n_z +1) b =0 → sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b=0

Let me take equation (1) and express a in terms of b.

From equation (1):

a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

But cosθ -1 is equal to -2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So perhaps we can find a simplification.

Let me compute:

a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)
Denominator: -2 sin²(theta/2)

So,

a = [ - (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) / (-2 sin²(theta/2)) ) ] b

The negatives cancel, and 2 cancels. So,

a = [ (sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) / sin²(theta/2) ) ] b
= [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] b
= cot(theta/2) b

So a = cot(theta/2) * b

So the ratio a/b is cot(theta/2). Which is the same as [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)].

So the eigenvector components are a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b.

Wait, but to write the vector, we can express it as (a, b) = ( [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b, b )

Let me factor out b, so the vector can be written as b [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), 1 ]

Which can be written as [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] multiplied by 1/sin(theta/2) times b, but I think that's getting a bit tangled. Let me think differently.

Let me choose b = sin(theta/2), then a = cos(theta/2). So the vector becomes [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Wait, because if I set b = sin(theta/2), then a = cos(theta/2), because a = [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ] * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2).

So the vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, but that's an eigenvector only up to a scalar multiple. So the normalized eigenvector would have these components, but scaled to have norm 1.

Wait, the original matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvector is a two-component vector.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but that's not normalized. Because the norm is sqrt( cos² + sin² )=1, so it's already normalized.

Wait, but let me check all the options.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) → that's what I got for the vector. But wait, what about the scaling? Because when I set b = sin(theta/2), the vector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]. So that's correct.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, eigenvectors are often expressed as column vectors. So this would mean that the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but looking back at the original problem, the possible options don't all directly match this. Let me look at the options again.

Option B is (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ). Hmm, which is a spherical harmonic kind of form, but for spin-1/2 particles, perhaps. But in our case, the eigenvector has theta/2.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but I should make sure that the vector is normalized. The components I found are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), which have a norm of 1, so they are normalized.

But wait, the eigenvector could have a phase factor. Because in quantum mechanics, eigenvectors are only defined up to a scalar multiple (a phase, since the global phase doesn't matter). So perhaps the vector could also be written with a phase e^{i something}.

Wait, but the problem states that the eigenvector is for the direction n lying in the x-z plane. So the components are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but let me see the options again.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) → yes.

Wait, but then why does option D have sqrt(2/3) and so on? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Because the operator is (P · n) = (ħ/2) times that matrix. So I found the eigenvector for that operator, but perhaps the question is about the eigenvector of, say, the Pauli matrices?

Wait no, the question is about the eigenvector of P along n, which is (P · n), which we derived as having eigenvector (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, looking again, the answer options don't have theta in the same way. Let me think about the options.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but we're being asked for the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Wait, but the components I found, cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), are already normalized because cos² + sin² =1.

So the answer should be option C.

But wait, looking back at the problem statement, the given components have ħ/2 as a factor. So perhaps when calculating the eigenvector, the hbar doesn't factor into the components because we're dealing with matrix multiplication, which is in terms of the operator.

Wait, the matrices are given as multiplied by ħ/2, but the eigenvectors are just vectors, so the components are dimensionless (or in terms of ħ? No, because the operator's dimensions are in terms of ħ/2, but the eigenvectors are just vectors in Hilbert space, so they are dimensionless.

Wait, but looking at the options, some include factors of ħ. So option A and D have ħ in the components. Hmm.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because eigenvectors are vectors, and the operator matrices have dimensions (with ħ), but the eigenvectors are just vectors, not having ħ in their components. So perhaps the options are misleading, but looking at the question again: the problem says, "what are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?" So they're looking for the components of the vector, which should be dimensionless. So I think the correct option is C.

But let me think again. The operator is (P ·n)/ħ? No, because each component is multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator Pn is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) = (ħ/2) [n_z σ_z + n_x σ_x], where σ are the Pauli matrices.

So the operator is (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z ) = (ħ/2) ( σ · n ), which is the standard spin operator.

The eigenvalues of this operator are ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvectors correspond to spin-up and spin-down along the n direction.

The spin-up eigenvector along n is given by:

|ψ> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T

But wait, in our case, since n lies in the x-z plane, phi is zero. Because the direction is in x-z, so phi=0. Because phi is the azimuthal angle around the z-axis, so if n is in x-z, phi=0.

So the eigenvector becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Which matches option C.

So why is option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta))?

Wait, because option B is for theta being the polar angle, and phi the azimuthal. But if n is in the x-z plane, then phi=0, so e^{i phi} =1, so option B would give (cos(theta), sin(theta)), which isn't the same as our result.

So in our case, the correct normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

Wait, but let me think again. Could the eigenvector involve a global phase factor? Or perhaps a factor that depends on the operator's definition.

Wait, the eigenvector for spin-up along n is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) with theta being the polar angle from the z-axis.

Yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be option C.

The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is a vector operator with components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each given as $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be parametrized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

The operator along $\vec{n}$ is $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$. Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the resulting matrix for $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, the matrix equation becomes:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

\[
(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0, \quad n_x a - (n_z + 1)b = 0.
\]

Solving these equations, the ratio of $a$ to $b$ is found to be $a = \cot(\theta/2) b$. Choosing $b = \sin(\theta/2)$ and $a = \cos(\theta/2)$ gives the normalized eigenvector:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches option C. The other options are inconsistent with the derived result. For example:

- Option A includes factors of $\hbar$, which are not part of the normalized eigenvector.
- Option B corresponds to spherical coordinates but does not match the derived eigenvector structure.
- Option D introduces unnecessary normalization factors and does not align with the derived result.

Thus, the correct normalized eigenvector is given by option C.
