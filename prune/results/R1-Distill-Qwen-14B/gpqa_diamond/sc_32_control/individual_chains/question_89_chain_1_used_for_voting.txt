Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it my best shot.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they usually undergo an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. This is probably a dehydrohalogenation reaction, which would create an alkene between the two carbons where the bromines were. So product 1 is likely adamantyl with a double bond.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: there's a peak at 4.79 ppm that integrates to 2H. That's usually where alkenes show up, maybe as a multiplet if they're coupled. But wait, the integration is 2H, so maybe it's a pair of protons on adjacent carbons in a double bond. The IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which I think is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Hmm, wait, no, that doesn't fit with an alkene. Oh wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH. Oh wait, wait! I think I confused dehydrohalogenation with something else. Maybe it's not elimination. Let me recall: when two bromines are on adjacent carbons, strong base might cause elimination to form a double bond. But the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl group. Oh, wait, maybe it's a substitution reaction. But KOH is a base, not a good nucleophile for substitution without a good leaving group. Hmm.

Alternatively, could it be an E2 elimination forming a double bond? Then why is there a carbonyl in the IR? Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so perhaps the arrangement of the carbons is such that elimination leads to a ketone or something else. Hmm.

Wait another thought: maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Oh! Wait, KOH can cause a ring-opening. But adamantane is a very stable structure, so maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dihalide undergoing a nucleophilic substitution. But if it's a vicinal dihalide, substitution would lead to an elimination of two molecules, perhaps. Wait, wait—maybe it's a double elimination, but that seems unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't an alkene but a diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—when heated with excess KOH, maybe it's undergoing a substitution. But for each Br, the substitution would result in an alcohol. But since there are two Brs, perhaps each substitution yields an alcohol. But that would give 1,3-diol. However, the IR doesn't show an OH stretch; maybe it's dehydrating. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, but that would require oxidation, and I don't know if KOH does that.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's an epoxide. But to form an epoxide from a dihalide, you typically need a base that can induce an elimination to form a three-membered ring. But I'm not sure if KOH would do that for such a structure.

Wait, the NMR spectrum of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H). That's high up, maybe adjacent to an electronegative atom. If it's a double bond, those protons would typically be around 4-5 ppm. So perhaps it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Oh, wait, maybe the product is a ketone. Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH could undergo two SN2 reactions. But that would produce a diol. If each Br is replaced by OH, then product would be 1,3-diol. But then, wait, the IR would show O-H stretches, but the given IR is at 1720 cm-1, which is more like a carbonyl. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe the initial reaction forms a ketone. How? Oh, wait, maybe it's a peroxide elimination, but that's more for vicinal dihalides with peroxide, forming alkenes.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. Then, the IR at 1720 cm-1 would be a carbonyl elsewhere. But how?

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone because of some rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the NMR data is from an epoxide. Or maybe the initial product is an ether. Wait, but I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when heated with KOH, undergoes a ring-opening to form a structure with a carbonyl. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination forming an alkene and the IR shows a carbonyl from an adjacent structure.

Wait, another angle: the IR peak at 1720 is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product is a ketone. So, how do you get a ketone from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Wait, perhaps it's a pinacol-type rearrangement? The pinacol rearrangement involves 1,2-diols (vicinal diols) losing water to form a carbonyl. But in this case, we started with a dihalide. Oh, unless the dihalide is first hydrolyzed to a diol, which then undergoes a rearrangement.

So, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps it forms 1,3-diol via two SN2 substitutions. Then, when heated, the diol loses a water molecule to form a carbonyl group. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone.

Wait, but the pinacol rearrangement requires a 1,2-diol, not a 1,3-diol. So that might not fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the diol is then dehydrated to form an alkene, but that would give a double bond, which doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the NMR again. The 4.79 ppm for 2H is a singlet? Or is it a triplet? The question says it's 4.79(2H). The description doesn't specify splitting, but it's possible that those are two protons as a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's a quartet or something else. But the main point is that the IR shows a carbonyl.

Another possibility: Maybe the product is an epoxide. Epoxides have protons around 3-4 ppm, but I'm not sure about that. Or perhaps it's a carbonyl group, so maybe the product is a diketone, but that's unlikely from this starting material.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a carbonyl via oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ether, but that's not a carbonyl.

I'm a bit stuck, so let's think of another approach. The product's NMR: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 10H in that region suggests a lot of equivalent protons, perhaps in a bridge structure like adamantane.

Wait, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH—maybe it's a double elimination, removing two HBr molecules and forming a carbonyl group. So, perhaps the product is a carbonyl compound.

Wait, wait—another thought. When a vicinal dihalide (like 1,2-dibromoethane) reacts with a base, it can form an alkene. But if the dihalide is in a bridge structure, maybe elimination leads to a ring contraction or expansion, forming a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination isn't forming a double bond but a carbonyl. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the product is an ester or an acid, but the IR doesn't show a peak for O-H in that region, so it's more likely a ketone or an aldehyde.

Wait, the IR at 1720 cm-1 is a strong, typical carbonyl. So it's either a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. Considering the reaction conditions, it's more likely a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone.

So, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH gives a ketone. How?

Wait, perhaps the KOH induces an elimination where each Br is removed, and the two adjacent carbons form a double bond. But that would give an alkene, not a ketone. So maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps each Br is replaced by OH via substitution, then the diol undergoes some kind of elimination to form a carbonyl group. But that would require a 1,2-diol, not a 1,3-diol.

Alternatively, another possibility: Maybe the KOH isn't just a base but also acts as a nucleophile. In some cases, elimination can form a carbonyl if there's a neighboring group. Wait, perhaps the structure has a bridge that, upon elimination, forms a ketone.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure, but maybe the product is a ketone. Let's assume that product 1 is a ketone. So, moving on.

Then product 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts reactions. But since product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol or something else.

Wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation typically requires an alkyl halide and a Lewis acid. But product 1 is a ketone. Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alkyne? No, because IR at 1720 is carbonyl. Wait, another thought: maybe product 1 is a diol that then forms an epoxide when treated with a base. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction produces an alcohol, which then undergoes some elimination under the influence of a Lewis acid. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. Because when a vicinal dihalide reacts with a base, it can form an epoxide. But I'm not sure if KOH would do that. Alternatively, maybe it's a base-induced epoxide formation, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is formed via some kind of acid-catalyzed rearrangement, like a pinacol rearrangement. But product 1 is a ketone, so I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the second step forms a more substituted structure. Let's think again.

If product 1 is a ketone (say, 1,3-diketone or something), then heating with aluminum isopropoxide might cause some kind of rearrangement or perhaps an aldol condensation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alkene, and the second step is a hydration. But product 1's IR doesn't show a peak for a C=C; instead, it's a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an ester or a ketone, and the second step is an acid-catalyzed reaction.

Hmm. I'm not entirely sure about the first two steps, but perhaps I should focus on the ozonolysis part. If product 2 is ozonolyzed, what would happen?

Ozonolysis of alkenes typically breaks them into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were. But the question is, what is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR?

Wait, so product 2 is the product after treating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or something else. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an alkene, which would then undergo ozonolysis.

Wait, let's think. Suppose product 1 is an alkene, then product 2 might be something else, but that seems unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an epoxide. Then ozonolysis wouldn't apply to an epoxide, so perhaps not.

Wait, going back to product 1. The NMR has 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H). The 10H in the 2-2.4 region suggests a lot of equivalent protons. Maybe product 1 is an adamantane derivative with some protons in a bridge.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, how would that look? The 4.79(2H) could be adjacent to the carbonyl. For example, if it's a ketone, perhaps it's a structure like (CH2)2CO, but in a bridge structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 is a methylene group next to a carbonyl. So, maybe the structure is (CH2)2CO-adamantyl or something like that.

Then, product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 undergoes some kind of enolization or tautomerism, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but product 1 is a ketone, not an alkyl halide.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an alkene, and product 2 is a diol, but that doesn't fit with the initial steps.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, which would then react further in the second step. But I'm not certain.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the ozonolysis part. If product 2 is an alkene, then ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyl groups.

So, let's suppose product 2 is an alkene. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, and the product would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

In product 3's NMR, the most deshielded hydrogen would be next to a carbonyl group. So, perhaps it's a methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, in the case of ozonolysis, the original alkene becomes two carbonyl groups. So, for each end of the double bond, you get a carbonyl.

Now, the coupling pattern depends on the neighboring protons. If the hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl group, it's likely to be deshielded and show a particular splitting.

Wait, for example, if the structure is something like CH2(CO)R, then the CH2 would be next to the carbonyl. The splitting would depend on how many neighboring H's are present.

But if the carbonyl is at the end of a chain, the adjacent protons might only have one neighbor. Alternatively, if the carbonyl is in the middle, the adjacent CH2 might be next to another CH2 group, leading to more splitting.

Wait, the most deshielded hydrogen would be the one closest to the electronegative group, like the carbonyl. So, perhaps it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl.

Now, considering the splitting: if the hydrogen is on a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2, each proton on the CH2 would have neighboring protons on the adjacent CH2. So, for each proton on the first CH2, it would see two protons on the neighboring CH2. That would result in a triplet for each, but since both protons on the first CH2 are equivalent, the splitting would be a triplet.

Wait, but if the adjacent group is a CH2 group, each proton on the first CH2 would couple with two protons on the adjacent CH2. So, each would split into a triplet, but since the two protons are equivalent, the overall splitting could be a triplet of triplets or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the adjacent group is a CH with one proton, but that seems less likely.

Wait, let me think about a simple structure. Suppose the ozonolysis produces a diketone. Then, each end has a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. So, the CH2 groups would be next to the carbonyl.

Each CH2 would be adjacent to another CH2 group. Let's say the structure is CH2(CO)CH2CO. No, wait, that's not quite right. Ozonolysis of a simple alkene like CH2=CH2 would give two formaldehyde molecules, but in a more substituted case, it would give ketones or other products.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is something like (CH2)2CO-R and R-CO(CH2)2. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis breaks the alkene into two carbonyl groups, each connected to bridge structures.

Wait, another angle: the most deshielded hydrogen would be on a proton that's adjacent to a carbonyl group and possibly has neighboring protons that are not equivalent.

If the hydrogen is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and also next to another CH2 group, each of the two protons would couple with the two protons in the adjacent group. So each would split into a triplet. But since both protons are equivalent, the overall splitting would be a triplet, or perhaps a more complex pattern.

Alternatively, if the adjacent group is a single proton, like a CH group, then each proton would split into a doublet. But I'm not sure.

Wait, considering product 3's NMR: the most deshielded hydrogen is likely on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl group, which is itself part of a bridge structure.

Let me think about the splitting. Suppose each CH2 has two protons, and each is adjacent to another CH2 group with two protons. So, each proton on the first CH2 would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2. That would lead to a triplet for each. But since the two protons on the CH2 are equivalent, the overall splitting would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if the adjacent group is a CH with one proton, then each would couple into a doublet. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and also next to another CH2 group. Each proton would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

But wait, the question's options include triplet, triplet of triplets, etc. So maybe it's a more complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps the structure has more than two neighboring groups. For example, if the CH2 group is adjacent to two different groups, each with protons, leading to more splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to a CH group, which has its own coupling.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 is next to one CH2 group on one side and another group on the other. That could complicate the splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to a carbon that has two different groups, leading to each proton on the CH2 coupling with two different sets of protons.

Wait, for example, if the CH2 group is next to a CH group which is in turn next to another CH2 group, then each proton on the original CH2 would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2 and perhaps the one proton on the CH group. That would lead to a more complex splitting pattern, like a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to visualize.

Suppose product 3 has a structure like this: R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R'. Then, the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls would each have two protons. Each of these CH2 groups is next to another CH2 group.

So, each proton on the first CH2 would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2. That would split each into a triplet. But since each CH2 has two equivalent protons, the overall splitting for each would be a triplet.

So, in the NMR, each of these protons would appear as a triplet. But wait, the question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, which would be adjacent to the carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 is next to a bridgehead, making the coupling more complex.

Wait, another thought: in the ozonolysis product, the carbonyl groups are at the ends of the molecule. The CH2 groups next to them would be adjacent to bridgehead carbons, which might have no protons or perhaps only one proton each.

Hmm, not sure. Maybe the most deshielded protons are on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and also next to a bridgehead with two protons.

Wait, perhaps the splitting is due to coupling with two different sets of protons. For example, each proton on the CH2 would couple with two protons from one adjacent group and two from another, leading to a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps each proton is coupling with two different neighbors, resulting in a doublet of doublets. But none of the options match that exactly.

Wait, looking back at the options:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

So, if each proton is coupled with two neighboring protons, that would be a triplet.

But if each proton is coupled with two protons from one group and another two from another, perhaps leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if each proton is coupled with one proton from one group and two from another, the pattern might be a doublet of triplets.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to a CH group, which is adjacent to another CH2. So each proton on the original CH2 would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2 group and the one proton on the CH group. That would lead to a triplet from the CH2 and a doublet from the CH, but the overall pattern would be more complex.

Wait, but each coupling is with a certain number of protons. So if a proton is coupling with two different sets, each with two protons, that might lead to a triplet of triplets. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. Then, each proton on that CH would couple with two protons from a neighboring CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

But wait, CH groups have only one proton each, so their splitting would be more pronounced.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure leads to each proton having two neighboring groups, each with two protons, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: think about the number of neighboring protons.

If a proton is adjacent to a CH2 group with two protons, each of its two protons would split into a triplet. But if the same proton is also adjacent to another CH2 group, perhaps leading to each proton being split by four protons (two from each neighbor), which would result in a quintet. But that's option D.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and also adjacent to a bridgehead with two protons. So, each proton on the CH2 would couple with two protons from the bridgehead, leading to a triplet.

So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

So, the answer would be A) triplet.

Wait, but earlier I thought maybe it's a triplet of triplets. I'm a bit confused.

Another approach: in the product after ozonolysis, the structure might have a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl and also adjacent to another CH2 group. Each proton on the first CH2 would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2. So each would split into a triplet. Thus, the NMR would show a triplet for these protons.

But wait, perhaps the adjacent CH2 is part of a bridge, and each proton on the original CH2 is coupling with two protons on the adjacent CH2 and also with another set of protons elsewhere, leading to a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the adjacent group is a CH group, which would lead to a doublet.

But I'm not entirely sure. Given the options, I think the most likely answer is a triplet.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH likely results in a dehydrohalogenation reaction, forming an alkene. However, the IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group. This suggests that the reaction may involve an elimination followed by a rearrangement, such as a pinacol-like process, leading to a ketone. The NMR data for product 1 (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) supports this interpretation, with the 4.79 ppm peak likely corresponding to a CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl.

2. **Reaction with aluminum isopropoxide**:  
   Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely induces a rearrangement or further reaction, forming product 2. While the exact structure of product 2 is unclear, it is reasonable to assume it contains a conjugated system, such as an alkene, which sets the stage for the subsequent ozonolysis step.

3. **Ozonolysis**:  
   Ozonolysis of product 2 cleaves any double bonds, forming carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would likely be on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. The coupling pattern of this hydrogen depends on the number and arrangement of neighboring protons. If the CH₂ group is adjacent to another CH₂ group, each proton on the CH₂ would couple with the two protons on the neighboring CH₂, resulting in a triplet.

4. **Coupling pattern analysis**:  
   The splitting observed in the NMR spectrum is consistent with a triplet, as each proton on the CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl couples with two equivalent protons from the neighboring CH₂ group.

**Critical analysis of options**:  
- **A) Triplet**: Matches the expected splitting pattern for a CH₂ group adjacent to another CH₂ group.  
- **B) Triplet of triplets**: Unlikely, as this would require coupling with two distinct sets of protons, which is not supported by the structure.  
- **C) Doublet of triplets**: Unlikely, as there is no evidence of coupling with a single proton and two protons simultaneously.  
- **D) Pentet**: Unlikely, as this would require coupling with four equivalent protons, which is not supported by the structure.  

The most plausible coupling pattern is a triplet.  

**Answer: A**
