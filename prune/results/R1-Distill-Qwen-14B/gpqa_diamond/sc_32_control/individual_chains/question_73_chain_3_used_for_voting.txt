Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Let's see, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, things like length contraction and time dilation come into play, but wait, this is about relative velocity, so maybe I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

Wait, the problem says the astronauts are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. But I'm trying to find the relative speed between them. Oh right, because from one astronaut's frame, the other is moving at some speed, not just the sum because of relativity. So the formula for adding velocities is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/c²), but wait, wait, I think I got it mixed up. Let me think again. Oh right, if one object is moving at u relative to the other which is moving at v relative to the observer, then the speed of the first relative to the second is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). But wait, wait, wait. No, I think I might have it backward. Wait, no, the formula is (u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²))), where u is the velocity of the first object as observed from the rest frame, and v is the velocity of the second. So in this case, astronaut A has velocity 0.6c, astronaut B has 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, what is the speed of B?

Wait, no, the problem is to find the relative speed between them. So, who's moving relative to whom? Because relative speed is a bit ambiguous here. Wait, but in relativity, the relative velocity depends on the frame. So perhaps the question is assuming that each is in their own rest frame, and we find the velocity of one from the other's frame.

But perhaps the problem is phrased as the relative speed of the two astronauts as measured in one frame. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the relative speed between the two as measured in the rest frame of one of them. Hmm, the question says, "the relative speed and the total energy of the system." Wait, the system is the two astronauts, I think, so perhaps the total energy is the sum of their energies from a certain frame, maybe the rest frame where their combined momentum cancels out. Or maybe just the sum from the lab frame.

But let's take it step by step. First, the relative speed. So, if I'm astronaut A moving at 0.6c, then I want to find the speed of astronaut B relative to me. Since both are moving in the same direction, it's (v = 0.5c and u = 0.6c). Wait, no, in the lab frame, A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, what's B's speed?

Wait, A is moving at 0.6c, and B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So in the lab frame, B is moving slower than A. So from A's frame, B's speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) = (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) )= (-0.1c) / 0.7 = approximately -0.1428c. So the negative sign indicates direction; the magnitude is 0.1428c. So relative speed would be about 0.14c. Wait, but the options have 0.14c as an option. So the relative speed is about 0.14c, but the sign is negative, so direction is opposite to the x-direction. But the question is about the relative speed, which is the magnitude, so 0.14c.

So that's one part; the relative speed is approximately 0.14c.

Now for the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that the total energy in relativity is the sum of the energies of each astronaut. But wait, each astronaut's energy depends on their velocity and mass. Wait, but their masses are given as 2m and 3m. So the total energy would be the sum of their rest energies plus their kinetic energies, but wait, total energy in their respective frames? Or in the lab frame?

Wait, the problem says "the total energy of the system." In physics, the total energy would typically be the sum of their energies in the same frame. But which frame? The lab frame, perhaps.

So if we're calculating the total energy in the lab frame, each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma * m c². So for the first astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma for 0.6c is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma for 0.5c is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25)=1/sqrt(0.75) ≈1.1547.

So energy is 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈3.464 m c².

Total energy would be 2.5 + 3.464 ≈5.964 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches. Option B also has E=4.96, but that's lower.

Wait, but wait, another thought: if the system's total energy is the sum of the energies in the center-of-momentum frame, or is it the sum in the lab frame? The problem says "the total energy of the system." Hmm, in relativity, the total energy is frame-dependent. So if the question is asking for the total energy in the lab frame, then option C's E is correct. But perhaps the system's rest frame (the frame where total momentum is zero) would have a different energy.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the frame for the total energy. Hmm. The options are in terms of mc^2, so perhaps they are adding the rest energies plus kinetic, but in the lab frame.

Wait, another approach: the total energy is the sum of each astronaut's energy as measured in the lab frame. So yes, that's 2.5 + 3.464 ≈5.964 mc². So that would match option C's E=5.96 mc². So the correct option for energy would be 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². So that would be the correct choice.

Alternatively, what if the question is asking for the rest energy of the system? Then it's (2m +3m) c² =5m c². But that's option D's E=5mc^2. But the problem says "total energy," which usually includes kinetic energy as well, unless stated otherwise.

So the relative speed is 0.14c and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². That points to option C.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The two astronauts are moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds of \( 0.6c \) and \( 0.5c \). The relative speed between them, as observed in the frame of the astronaut moving at \( 0.6c \), is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) (velocity of the first astronaut) and \( v = 0.5c \) (velocity of the second astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction of motion, but the relative speed is the magnitude, so \( v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \).

1. **First astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):**
   \[
   \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
   \]
   Energy:
   \[
   E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
   \]

2. **Second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):**
   \[
   \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
   \]
   Energy:
   \[
   E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
   \]

The total energy of the system is:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
