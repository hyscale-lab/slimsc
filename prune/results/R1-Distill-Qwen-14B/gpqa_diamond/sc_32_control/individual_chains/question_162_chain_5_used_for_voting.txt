Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the area of a pseudosphere with a given metric. Let me try to unpack this step by step. 

First, the metric provided is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). I'm a bit rusty, but I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor describes the geometry of spacetime. But wait, this question is about a pseudosphere's area. Pseudosphere is a term I've heard before in the context of hyperbolic geometry, right?

Wait, no, pseudosphere in this context might be referring to a sphere in a spacetime context, but perhaps it's a typo or maybe it's a specific term. Alternatively, maybe the question is about a 2-dimensional surface embedded in some space.

Hmm, the metric given is in terms of x and y. So probably it's a 2-dimensional metric. The form looks a bit like the metric for a sphere but with a different denominator. Let me think: the standard metric for a sphere of radius a is (dx² + dy²)/(a² - x² - y²), but wait, that's not quite right. Let me correct that. The metric for a sphere in stereographic coordinates is [4/(a² + r²)^2] (dr² + r² dθ²), but maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the line element given. The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] (dx² + dy²). The denominator is 4 minus (x² + y²), so when x² + y² approaches 4, the metric blows up, right? So the region where x² + y² < 4 is allowed, and beyond that, it's not part of the manifold.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So maybe the radius parameter here is 2 because the denominator is 4. Let me think: 4 is 2 squared, so that makes sense.

I remember that for a metric of the form ds² = f(r)² (dr² + r² dθ²), which is a 2D metric in polar coordinates, the area can be found by integrating over θ and r, but maybe there's a formula for the total area.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps this is a metric on a sphere or a hyperboloid. The given metric is for a 2D surface, I think. Let me try another approach. The area of a 2D surface with metric ds² = g_{xx} dx² + g_{yy} dy² (since it's diagonal) can be found using the formula for the area element, which is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor.

In this case, the metric is written as ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So the metric tensor components are g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), g_yy = same, and g_xy = 0, g_xθ =0 etc. So the determinant g is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². The square root of that is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

Wait, but to find the area, we need to integrate the area element over the entire surface. So the area would be the integral of sqrt(g) dx dy, which is ∫∫ [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but what is the region over which we integrate? Since the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), the denominator is positive when x² + y² <4, so the surface is defined for x² + y² <4. So the integration is over the disk where x² + y² <4.

But wait, I'm not so sure. Alternatively, maybe the metric is defined on a compact surface, like a sphere, but I'm not sure. Let me think about a similar case: the metric for a sphere in polar coordinates is ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²) / (1 - (r²/a²)), or something like that. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the line element and how it's related to the area.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric given is similar to that of a hyperbolic space. For 2D hyperbolic space, the metric can be written as ds² = dr² + (a^2) sinh²(r/a) dθ², but that's in a different coordinate system. Or perhaps in isothermal coordinates, the metric can look different.

Wait, but in the given problem, the metric is expressed in terms of x and y, so it's probably in Cartesian coordinates. The area element would be sqrt(g) dx dy, which in this case is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but to compute the area, I would have to integrate this over the allowed region. The allowed region is where 4 - x² - y² >0, i.e., the disk of radius 2. So the area A is the integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Hmm, that integral looks a bit tricky, but perhaps it's manageable by switching to polar coordinates. Let me try that.

In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y= r sinθ. Then x² + y² = r². The area element becomes r dr dθ. So the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ

Wait, because the Jacobian determinant for polar coordinates is r, so dx dy = r dr dθ.

Let me compute this integral. Let me separate the angular integral and the radial integral.

A = [∫0^2π dθ] * [∫0^2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr ]

The angular integral ∫0^2π dθ is 2π.

So A = 2π * [∫0^2 (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr ]

Let me compute the radial integral I = ∫ [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution: let u =4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r, so -du/2 = r dr.

But the integral becomes: 32 ∫ [ r dr ] / (4 - r²) = 32 ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] 

Wait, the substitution:

u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = - du/2.

So the integral I becomes:

I = ∫ (32) * [ r dr / (4 - r²) ] = 32 ∫ [ (r dr) / u ]

= 32 ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] = 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (1/u du) 

= -16 ∫ (1/u) du 

The integral of 1/u is ln |u|, so:

I = -16 [ ln |4 - r²| ] evaluated from r=0 to r=2.

Wait, but when r approaches 2, 4 - r² approaches 0. So let's compute the limits.

At r=2, u=0. So ln(0) is negative infinity. At r=0, u=4, so ln(4).

So I = -16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] → ln(0) is -infty, so it's -16 [ (-infty) - ln(4) ) ] → which is -16 * (-infty - ln4) → which is positive infinity.

Wait, wait a second. But r goes up to 2, which is exactly where the denominator becomes zero. So the integral I is from 0 to 2, but as r approaches 2, 4 - r² approaches zero from the positive side (since r is less than 2). So the integrand behaves like 32 r / (4 - r²) → it goes to positive infinity as r approaches 2 from below.

So the integral I is divergent; it's +infty. Because as r approaches 2, the integrand becomes very large and positive, so the area is infinite?

But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So if the area is infinite, that would suggest that the area is +infty, which is option D.

Wait, but that might not make sense. Let me think again. Because the surface is a pseudosphere, which I think is a complete surface with finite area. Or maybe it's a sphere in some way.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach. Let me think: the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me check if this is a metric of a sphere or a hyperboloid.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a metric on a sphere with a radius of 2. Let me think about the standard metric for a 2-sphere. The standard metric in polar coordinates is ds² = (r²) (dr² + r² dθ²), but that's for a sphere of radius r. Alternatively, in stereographic coordinates, the metric can be written differently.

Wait, wait a moment. I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The denominator in the metric is 4 - (x² + y²), which suggests that the surface is defined for points where x² + y² <4, so the radius is 2.

Wait, but if I'm integrating the area element [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] dx dy over the disk of radius 2, and I get an infinite result, then the area is infinite. But that can't be right for a sphere. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the metric.

Alternatively, maybe the metric is actually that of a 2-sphere of radius 2, but in a different coordinate system. Let me reconsider.

Wait, another approach: the metric given is similar to that of a sphere in isothermal coordinates. The isothermal metric is usually written as ds² = (4a²)/(a² - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), where a is the radius of the sphere. Comparing to our metric, which is:

ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²) = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²), since x² + y² = r².

So comparing, 4a²/(a² - r²)^2 = 32/(4 - r²). Hmm, let's see:

Let me set a² =4, so a=2. Then the isothermal metric becomes (4*(2)^2)/(4 - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²) ) = (16)/(4 - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²).

But our metric is 32/(4 -r²) (dr² + r² dθ²).

Wait, that doesn't match. So perhaps the given metric isn't the isothermal metric for a sphere. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different kind of coordinate system or a hyperbolic space.

Wait, hyperbolic geometry has metrics where the area element can be finite or infinite. But in this case, the integral diverges, so the area would be infinite.

Wait, but I thought pseudospheres (like the tractricoid) have finite area. Wait, maybe I'm mixing terms. Or perhaps this problem is about a different kind of pseudosphere.

Wait, perhaps the pseudosphere in this question is not the tractricoid but a different concept. Alternatively, perhaps the metric describes a 2-dimensional surface with constant negative curvature, which would make it a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area.

Wait, if the metric is that of a hyperbolic plane, then the area would be infinite. But the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, but a pseudosphere is a finite surface, isn't it? Like the tractricoid, which is a surface of constant negative curvature, but it's a finite area, right?

Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Let me think about the metric again. The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). If I rewrite this in polar coordinates as I did earlier, we have:

ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²).

So the line element is similar to the hyperbolic metric but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sphere in some other coordinates.

Wait, perhaps this is the metric of a sphere with radius 2, but not in standard coordinates. Let me compute the Gaussian curvature to see. The Gaussian curvature K for a metric in 2D can be found using the formula:

K = - (1/(2*sqrt(g))) * d/dx (g^(11)_{,x}) + (g^(11)_{,y}) ) ) + similar terms, but perhaps it's easier to use another method.

Alternatively, for the metric ds² = E dr² + G dθ², where E and G are functions of r, the Gaussian curvature is given by:

K = [ (1/(2 E G)) ) ] * [ d/dr ( (E/G) dG/dr ) ].

Wait, maybe I should compute the Gaussian curvature K.

In our case, E = [32/(4 - r²)] and G = [32 r²/(4 - r²)].

So E = 32/(4 - r²), G = 32 r²/(4 - r²).

Compute the derivatives:

dG/dr = (32 * 2r (4 - r²) - 32 r² * (-2r)) ) / (4 - r²)^2

Wait, let me compute it correctly:

G = 32 r²/(4 - r²) → dG/dr = [ (64 r (4 - r²) ) + (32 r^3) ) ] / (4 - r²)^2 ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute using quotient rule.

dG/dr = [ (64 r) (4 - r²) ) - (32 r²)(-2 r) ) ] / (4 - r²)^2

= [64 r (4 - r²) + 64 r^3 ] / (4 - r²)^2

= [256 r - 64 r^3 +64 r^3 ] / (4 - r²)^2

= 256 r / (4 - r²)^2.

Now, compute (E/G) dG/dr:

E =32/(4 - r²), G=32 r²/(4 - r^2).

So E/G = [32/(4 - r²)] / [32 r²/(4 - r²)] ) = 1/(r²).

So (E/G) dG/dr = (1/r²) * [256 r / (4 - r²)^2 ] = 256/( r (4 - r²)^2 ).

Now, compute d/dr [ (E/G) dG/dr ].

= d/dr [256 / ( r (4 - r²)^2 ) ]

Let me make substitution: u = r (4 - r²)^2 →  denominator is u.

So let me compute the derivative:

d/dr [256 / u ] = 256 * (-1) u^{-2} * du/dr.

Compute du/dr:

u = r (4 - r²)^2 → du/dr = (4 - r²)^2 + r * 2 (4 - r²)(-2r)

= (4 - r²)^2 + r * (-4 r) (4 - r²)

= (4 - r²)[ (4 - r²) -4 r² ]

= (4 - r²)(4 -5 r² )

So putting it all together:

d/dr [256/u ] = (-256) [ (4 - r²)(4 -5 r²) ) ] / [ r² (4 - r²)^4 ) ]

= (-256) (4 -5 r²) ) / [ r² (4 - r²)^3 ) ]

Now, the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = [1/(2 E G)] * [ ... ]

Wait, earlier I thought the formula was K = [1/(2 E G)] * d/dr [ (E/G) dG/dr ]

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula for K. For a metric in polar coordinates, the Gaussian curvature is:

K = [1/(2 E G)] * [ d/dr ( (E/G) dG/dr ) ]

So putting it all together:

K = [1/(2 * (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) ) ] * [ (-256 (4 -5 r²) ) / ( r² (4 - r²)^3 ) ) ]

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me compute each part step by step.

Compute the first part: 2 E G.

E =32/(4 - r²), G=32 r²/(4 - r²).

So 2 E G = 2 * [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] 

= 2 * (32 *32 r² ) / (4 - r²)^2

= 2048 r² / (4 - r²)^2.

Now, the second part is the derivative term: [ (-256 (4 -5 r²) ) / ( r² (4 - r²)^3 ) ) ]

So K = [1/(2048 r² / (4 - r²)^2 ) ] * [ (-256 (4 -5 r²) ) / ( r² (4 - r²)^3 ) ) ]

Simplify:

K = [ (4 - r²)^2 / (2048 r²) ) ] * [ (-256 (4 -5 r²) ) / ( r² (4 - r²)^3 ) ) ]

Multiply the numerators and denominators:

= [ (4 - r²)^2 * (-256)(4 -5 r^2) ) ] / [2048 r^2 * r^2 (4 - r^2)^3 ) ]

= [ (-256) (4 - r^2)^2 (4 -5 r^2) ) ] / [2048 r^4 (4 - r^2)^3 ) ]

Simplify the (4 - r^2) terms: (4 - r^2)^2 / (4 - r^2)^3) = 1/(4 - r^2)

So,

= [ (-256) (4 -5 r^2) ) ] / [ 2048 r^4 (4 - r^2) ) ]

Factor numerator and denominator:

256 is 2^8, 2048 is 2^11, so 256/2048 = 1/8.

So,

= [ (-1/8) (4 -5 r^2) ) ] / [ r^4 (4 - r^2) ) ]

So,

K = [ (5 r^2 -4) ) ] / [8 r^4 (4 - r^2) ) ]

Hmm, but this expression for K depends on r, which suggests that the Gaussian curvature is not constant. But for a sphere or a hyperbolic plane, the curvature should be constant. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the derivation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should try a different approach. Another thought: the given metric may be conformally flat, since it's of the form ds² = f(x,y)^2 (dx² + dy²). The area element is f² dx dy, so integrating that over the allowed region.

Wait, earlier I thought that the area integral diverges because of the singularity at r=2. So the area would be infinite, which is option D. But why would a pseudosphere have infinite area?

Wait, maybe the term pseudosphere here refers to a different concept. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about a metric that's singular at r=2, leading to infinite area.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is that of a sphere of radius 2, but in a particular coordinate system, and the area is finite. Let me think: the area of a sphere of radius 2 is 4π (2)^2 = 16π. But none of the options directly match that.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option B: 4π(x² + y²)
Option C:4π(x² - y²)
Option A: 0
Option D: +infty

Wait, but the question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. So the area should be a number, but the options are functions of x and y, except for A, D which are 0 or infinity.

Hmm, that's confusing. Because I think the area should be a number, not a function. So perhaps the question is not well phrased, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the pseudosphere in this context is a surface with a line element as given, and the area is being computed, which would come from integrating the area element. But the integral diverges, so the area is infinite, which would be option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is that of a sphere with a finite area. Let me think again. If I compute the integral A = ∫∫ [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ over r from 0 to 2 and θ 0 to 2π.

Wait, the integral I computed earlier for A is 2π * [ ∫0^2 (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr ].

And that integral becomes:

32 ∫0^2 [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr = 32 ∫ [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr from 0 to 2.

Using substitution u =4 - r² → du= -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du from u=4 to u=0.

Wait, when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes 32*(-1/2) ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u) du.

Which is -16 ∫ (from 4 to 0) (1/u) du.

The integral of 1/u is ln|u|, so:

-16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ) ] → ln(0) is negative infinity, so this becomes:

-16 [ (-infty) - ln(4) ] = -16 * (-infty - ln4) → but this is positive infty, because when you multiply negative by negative, you get positive.

So the area is 2π * (infty) → infinite.

So the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

Thus, the correct option is D) +infty.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the area of a pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) given the metric:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right).
\]

### Key Observations:
1. **Metric Analysis**: The metric is conformally flat, written as \( ds^2 = f(x, y)^2 (dx^2 + dy^2) \), where \( f(x, y) = \sqrt{\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}} \). The area element is \( \sqrt{g} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy \).

2. **Integration Region**: The denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) implies the surface is defined for \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), corresponding to a disk of radius 2 in the \( (x, y) \)-plane.

3. **Polar Coordinates**: Converting to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta, y = r \sin\theta \)), the area element becomes:
   \[
   \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
   \]
   The limits of integration are \( r \in [0, 2) \) and \( \theta \in [0, 2\pi) \).

4. **Area Integral**: The total area \( A \) is:
   \[
   A = \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
   \]
   The angular integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi \). The radial integral \( \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \) is evaluated using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), leading to:
   \[
   \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \left[ \ln|u| \right]_{4}^{0}.
   \]
   As \( r \to 2 \), \( u \to 0 \), and \( \ln|u| \to -\infty \). Thus, the integral diverges to \( +\infty \).

5. **Conclusion**: The area of the pseudosphere is infinite due to the singularity at \( r = 2 \), where the metric blows up. This matches the behavior of a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A) 0**: Incorrect. The area is not zero; the surface extends over a region of positive measure.
- **B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)**: Incorrect. The area is not a function of \( x \) and \( y \); it is a scalar.
- **C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)**: Incorrect. Same reason as above.
- **D) \( +\infty \)**: Correct. The area integral diverges due to the singularity at \( r = 2 \).

### Final Answer:
The area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite.  
**Answer: D**
