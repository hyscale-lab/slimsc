Okay, so I have this question about physical theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question asks which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization? Oh right, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—those are infinities that pop up in calculations, making the results non-physical. Regularization introduces a temporary momentum cutoff or some other method to make the integrals finite, and then you remove the cutoff later, hopefully getting a finite result after renormalization.

So the question is which theory doesn't need this. So which theory is free from such divergences at high energies?

Let me go through each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, that's a classical theory. In classical electromagnetism, do you get infinities? I think in the classical theory, when you have point charges, you can get things like infinite self-energy or infinite charge density. But in the classical treatment, I don't think regularization is done because it's not a quantum theory. You might deal with these infinities differently, perhaps through the use of distributions or other mathematical tools, but I don't think regularization is part of the process here. So maybe classical E&M doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory where renormalization is needed.

But wait, the question is about high energies. High energies in quantum theories often lead to issues with perturbative expansions, hence the need for regularization. So maybe the point is that in some theories, the divergences aren't a problem because they're not quantum in nature.

Alternatively, another approach: which of these theories are known to be finite, i.e., no divergences, so no need for regularization?

Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a renormalizable theory, but it still requires renormalization because of the divergences. So you must use regularization methods in QED.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is similar. It's also a renormalizable theory, but it has issues like confinement and requires things like lattice regularization perhaps, or other methods. So QCD does need regularization.

Superstring theory is a quantum theory of gravity, right? Wait, but string theories in general are thought to be finite. I remember that in some contexts, like superstring theory, the perturbative expansion doesn't lead to the same types of divergences that QFT does. Or wait, do they? Because string theories are background-dependent and have different kinds of expansions. I think superstring theories are free from certain types of divergences, so maybe they don't require regularization in the same way. Or wait, do they still require some form of regularization to handle the quantized string modes or loop corrections?

Wait, another thought. In string theory, calculations are done on a worldsheet, and the theory is supposed to be background-independent and have a better-behaved perturbation series. But I'm not entirely sure if they avoid all divergences or if regularization is still needed. I might be wrong here.

But the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So perhaps it's classical electrodynamics because it's not a quantum theory and doesn't have the same divergences that quantum theories do. Wait, no, because classical E&M can have infinities, but regularization isn't a part of it. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, another angle: regularization is a quantum field theory technique. So any classical theory wouldn't require it. So the correct answer would be D) Classical Electrodynamics. Because it's a classical theory, it doesn't need regularization which is a quantum field theory tool.

Wait, but the question says "at high energies." How does that affect the options? Well, in high-energy (or high-momentum) situations, quantum effects are more prominent. But again, the question is about which theory doesn't require regularization—so perhaps the classical theory doesn't require it because it's not a quantum theory.

So putting it all together, the answer should be D) Classical Electrodynamics. Because it's a classical theory, it doesn't require regularization techniques that are specific to quantum field theories.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the options based on their nature and whether regularization is a necessary tool.

1. **Option A: Superstring Theory**  
   Superstring theory is a quantum theory that attempts to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity. While it is often described as finite and free from certain types of divergences, it still involves complex calculations that may require regularization techniques, especially in perturbative expansions. Thus, it is not guaranteed to never require regularization.

2. **Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**  
   QCD is a quantum field theory describing the interactions of quarks and gluons. It is renormalizable, but it still requires regularization due to the presence of divergences in its perturbative calculations. Techniques like lattice regularization are commonly used in QCD.

3. **Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**  
   QED is another quantum field theory, describing the interactions of charged particles with photons. It is renormalizable, but renormalization requires regularization to handle the divergences that arise in calculations.

4. **Option D: Classical Electrodynamics**  
   Classical electrodynamics is a classical theory, not a quantum field theory. While it can encounter infinities (e.g., infinite self-energy of point charges), regularization is not a concept or tool used in classical theories. Regularization is specific to quantum field theories, where divergences are handled through renormalization. Therefore, classical electrodynamics does not require regularization.

Based on this analysis, the theory that never requires regularization at high energies is **Classical Electrodynamics**.
