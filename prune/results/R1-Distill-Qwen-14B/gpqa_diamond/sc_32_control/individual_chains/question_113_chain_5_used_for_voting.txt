Okay, so I have this problem about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's see. The options are four different chemical formulas, and I need to figure out which one fits the given data.

First, I'll go through each piece of data one by one.

The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretches, like from alcohols or carboxylic acids. Oh wait, a very broad peak might be more like a carboxylic acid, which has a broad O-H stretch because it's hydrogen bonded. Or maybe it's an alcohol, but the broadness suggests something else. Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is around where carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, esters) absorb. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation. Wait, but 1650 might also be a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester or maybe an amide? But I don't think amide is an option here.

The 1H NMR has peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl H are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond, maybe a vinyl group. Also, the presence of multiple peaks suggests maybe a di-substituted or more complex structure.

Mass spec shows a fragment at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Wait, 45 could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+?), but wait, or maybe it's the fragment from something like CH3CO+ (which is 43, no) or maybe something else. Alternatively, 45 could be CH2O2 or another group. Let me think about common fragments. Oh, the fragment at 45 could correspond to (CH3)2CO+ or maybe something else. Wait, another possibility: the molecular ion could lose a group. For example, if the compound is an ester, maybe losing an alkyl group would give a fragment at 45. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O (which is 45: C=12, H=1, O=16. 2*12 + 6*1 +16 = 24+6+16=46? Wait no, (CH3)2O is 27+ (16-12=4?) Wait, let me calculate: (CH3)2O is (2*12) + (6*1) + 16 = 24 +6 +16=46. So 46. Then 45 would be something else. Wait, maybe it's a CH2CH2O group? Or perhaps it's the cleavage of an ester. Wait, another thought: maybe it's a COO group losing something. Alternatively, 45 could be a ketene ion, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the possible formulas:

Options are:

A) C6H12O2: molecular weight is 6*12 +12 + 2*16 =72+12+32=116.

B) C6H10O: 72 +10 +16=98.

C) C6H10O2:72 +10 +32=114.

D) C6H12O:72 +12 +16=100.

So the molecular weights are 116, 98, 114, 100.

In mass spec, the m/z 45 is a fragment. Let's see which option could have a fragment at 45.

For example, for option A, which is C6H12O2. If the molecule is something like methyl something, maybe losing a CO2 or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Let's think about ester cleavage. Esters typically lose the RCOO group and the OR group. For example, if the ester is R-O-CO-R', then in the mass spec, you might get the R-O- group as a fragment. Wait, but 45 is a small fragment. Alternatively, maybe it's a cleavage that produces a CH2O or similar group.

Wait, another approach: the IR has a peak at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is probably a carbonyl. The 1650 could be either another carbonyl (like conjugated or another group) or an aromatic ring with conjugation (like C=C in an aromatic ring, which usually is around 1450-1600). But 1650 is higher, so maybe another carbonyl or maybe a conjugated carbonyl.

If there's a carbonyl at 1700 and another peak at 1650, perhaps the molecule has two carbonyl groups. Wait, but that would require two such groups. Alternatively, one carbonyl and another functional group. Wait, but the 1700 is probably a strong carbonyl, like a ketone, ester, or carboxylic acid. Oh wait, but the broad peak at 3000 suggests O-H, which could be a carboxylic acid. So if it's a carboxylic acid, then the carbonyl would be around 1700. Then the 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester. For example, an ester's carbonyl is around 1730-1750 usually, but if it's conjugated, maybe it's lower. Or perhaps it's a ketone with conjugation, which can lower the wavenumber.

But wait, the IR also shows a broad peak. Let me think: if the compound is a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad, which fits the first IR peak. Then the 1700 would be the carboxylic acid carbonyl. The 1650 could be an aromatic ring. So maybe the compound is something like benzoic acid, but the molecular formula would be different. Wait, but the options don't have C7H6O2, which benzoic acid is (C7H6O2).

Wait, but the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so maybe the compound has a double bond, not an aromatic ring. So perhaps it's a dienophile or something else with a double bond.

Wait, another thought: the presence of two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 suggests two carbonyl groups. But in that case, the formula would have two oxygen-containing groups. Like maybe an ester and a ketone, or two esters, or a carboxylic acid and a ketone. Let me check the options for how many oxygen atoms they have.

Options:
A) C6H12O2: two O's. So, two oxygen-containing groups.
B) C6H10O: one O.
C) C6H10O2: two O's.
D) C6H12O: one O.

So options A, C have two O's. So if there are two carbonyls, the compound must have two oxygen-containing groups. So the compound could be an ester (which has two O's in the structure) and maybe another carbonyl group.

Wait, but an ester is O-CO-O, so it's a single carbonyl. So if there's another carbonyl, perhaps a ketone or something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's a diester or a ketone plus an ester.

Another angle: the presence of vinyl hydrogens (from NMR) suggests a double bond, so the compound has an alkene. So perhaps it's an ester with a double bond, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. Those can have conjugated carbonyls, which would lower their absorption wavenumbers. So the 1700 could be the ester carbonyl and 1650 could be the conjugated double bond.

Wait, but the conjugated double bond (like in an enone) would have a peak around 1650. So that might fit.

So if it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, the carbonyl would be around 1700, and the double bond would be around 1650.

So let's think about the structure: perhaps it's something like CH2=CH-CO-O-R, but then the formula would vary.

But the molecular formula is among the options. Let me think about each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. The degree of unsaturation: for C6H12O2. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0, N=0.

So (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2=2/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. Which could be a ring or a double bond. But the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. So perhaps one double bond and one ring? Or another scenario.

Wait, wait, if the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, then it would have a double bond and a carbonyl. So that's two degrees of unsaturation (double bond and carbonyl). Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2: (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree. So it's either a ring or a double bond or a carbonyl group. But wait, a carbonyl (C=O) is one degree, and a double bond (C=C) is another. So if it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, that would have two degrees. But according to the calculation, option A has only one. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe option A isn't correct.

Option C: C6H10O2. (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees of unsaturation. That could be one double bond and one ring, or two double bonds, etc. So that fits with having a double bond (from vinyl H) and a carbonyl group.

So let's think: if the formula is C6H10O2, which has two oxygens, maybe it's an ester with a double bond.

So the structure could be something like CH2=CHCOOR, but I'm not sure. Let's count the carbons.

Wait, the formula is C6H10O2. For an ester, the general formula is CnH2nO2. Wait, no, esters are RCOOR', where R and R' are alkyl groups. So the formula would be (n+2) carbons, or something else. Let me think: for an ester, the formula would be (for RCOOR'): (n + m + 2) carbons, but perhaps that's getting too detailed.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the mass spec has a fragment at 45. Let's think about which options can lose a 45 fragment.

If the formula is C6H10O2, and it breaks into a 45 fragment, what could that be?

45 is the molecular weight of CH3COOCH3? No, that's 45? Wait, CH3COOCH3 is methyl acetate. Let's compute: CH3COOCH3: C=3 (CH3) + 2 (COO) + 1 (CH3) = 6 C? No, wait, CH3COO is two carbons (O=C-O-), so the formula would be C3H6O2. Which has a molecular weight of 3*12 +6 +32=36+6+32=74. So m/z 74 would be the molecular ion, but the fragment is 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is something else. Another approach: 45 is C3H7O, but that's not possible because 3*12=36, 7*1=7, 16=16. 36+7+16=60. Hmm, no. Or wait, 45 could be C2H5O2? Let's calculate: 2*12=24, 5*1=5, 32=32. 24+5+32=61. No.

Wait, another thought: 45 could be (CH3)2CO+ which is acetone. The molecular weight of acetone is 58. Hmm, that's higher than 45. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about common fragment ions.

Another possibility: the fragment at m/z 45 could be the (CH2O) group, which is formaldehyde, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe a -CH2COO group losing something.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the molecular formulas again.

If the molecular ion is, say, for option C (C6H10O2), what could break off to leave a 45 fragment?

If the molecule is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, perhaps. But the formula would be more than 6 carbons. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula for each option and possible structures.

Option A: C6H12O2.

Possible structures: ester with an ether? No, O is only two. Maybe a cyclic ester (lactone), which would have the formula C6H10O2, which is option C, not A. So A is C6H12O2. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a diethyl something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, for the mass spec, the fragment at 45 could be a common ion. For example, in an ester, the cleavage could produce a fragment like the R-O- group. If the R group is (CH2)2O, which is 45. Wait, (CH2)2O is 12*2 + 2*2 +16 =24+4+16=44. No, that's 44. Close but not 45. Alternatively, maybe a CH3COO group (45? Let's compute: CH3COO is C2H3O2. 2*12=24, 3*1=3, 32. 24+3+32=59. No, that's higher.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the other data again.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So the molecule has a double bond. So the structure probably has an alkene.

The IR has a broad peak at 3000, which suggests O-H. So either alcohol or carboxylic acid.

But the 1700 cm^-1 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm^-1. The broad O-H would fit.

So if the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, that would have the O-H and the carbonyl. The formula would be CxHyO2. Let's see the options.

Option C is C6H10O2. So if it's a carboxylic acid (COOH), the general formula is CnH2nO2. For n=6, H would be 12. But option C has H=10. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a substituted carboxylic acid with a double bond.

Wait, the general formula for a carboxylic acid is CnH2n-1COOH, which is Cn+1H2n+1O2. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

A carboxylic acid is R-COOH. The formula for R being CmH2m-1 would make the carboxylic acid Cm+1H2m O2.

So for a carboxylic acid with a double bond, R would have a double bond, so the formula for R would be CmH2m-2. So overall, the molecule would be Cm+1H2m-1O2.

Hmm, let's see. For option C, it's C6H10O2. So 2m -1 =10 -> 2m=11, which isn't possible because m must be integer. So perhaps that's not a carboxylic acid.

Wait, maybe it's an ester. Esters have the formula RCOOR', so their formula is Cn+1+m H2n+2m+2 O2. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diester, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a ketone with an ester group, but that would require more oxygens. Wait, no, the options only have up to two oxygens.

Wait, another approach: the mass spec. The fragment at 45 could be from the loss of a group. For example, if the molecule is an ester, maybe the R-O- group is (CH2)2O, but that's 44. Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl group attached in a way that when it breaks off, it leaves a 45 fragment.

Wait, perhaps it's a lactone, which is a cyclic ester. The formula for a lactone would be CnH2nO2. For option C, it's C6H10O2. So 2n =10 -> n=5. So a 5-membered lactone. The structure would be something like a cyclic ester with a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the mass spec fragment could be an acylium ion or something else.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. If it's an ester, the general formula is (R-CO-O-R'). The degrees of unsaturation are two, which could be a double bond and a ring. So a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a substituted acetic acid. Let's think: if it's something like CH2=CHCOOH, that would be C3H4O2. But that's too small, and the options are C6.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more complex. Maybe it's a di-substituted ester with a double bond.

Alternatively, think about the NMR. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests that the molecule has a double bond. So, in the NMR, we would see peaks around 5-6 ppm for the vinyl H.

Putting it all together: the FTIR shows O-H (broad) and two carbonyls. The NMR has vinyl H. The mass spec has m/z 45.

Maybe the compound is a substituted acrylic acid ester. For example, something like CH2=CHCOO-R, but R would have to be a substituent that brings the formula to C6H10O2.

Wait, let's think about the formula: CH2=CHCOO-R where R is a methyl group. Then the formula would be CH2=CHCOOCH3, which is C4H6O2. But that's not matching any of the options. The options for C6.

Hmm. Maybe it's a larger ester. Like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's C7H12O2, which is beyond the options.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an orthoester or something else. Maybe a cyclic structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the IR has two carbonyl peaks due to conjugation. The 1700 could be the carbonyl of an ester, and the 1650 could be a conjugated double bond.

So, the structure could be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So, for example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2... but again, let's calculate.

Wait, the formula for an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 would be C5H8O2, which is smaller than the options given.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted ester with a double bond. Maybe the structure is CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH3, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the compound has a conjugated system, like an enol ester. But I'm not very confident.

Another approach: let's consider each option's possible structure and match with the data.

Option A: C6H12O2.

This formula has a molecular weight of 116. The degrees of unsaturation are 1. So it can be a ring or a double bond. Since the NMR shows vinyl H, it must be a double bond. So, a molecule with one double bond and no rings.

But then, the IR shows two carbonyl peaks. That would require two carbonyl groups, but option A has only two oxygens. So perhaps a ketone and an ester? Or two ester groups? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, but a ketone has one O, ester has two O's. No, not possible with only two O's.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ketone with an ester group. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, not too sure about this one.

Option B: C6H10O.

Wait, this has only one O. So, the IR peak at 1700 must be a carbonyl, but where? Maybe a ketone. The broad peak at 3000 could be an alcohol, but if the compound has only one O, it can't be a carboxylic acid (which has two O's). So maybe it's an alcohol with a ketone. But the 1700 and 1650 would then be the ketone and another group. I'm not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2.

Degrees of unsaturation: 2. So, possible a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds. Since the NMR has vinyl H, there's a double bond. So, maybe a ring and a double bond. Or two double bonds.

The IR has a broad peak (O-H) and two carbonyls. So, two O groups with two carbonyls. For example, an ester and a ketone. Or a carboxylic acid and a double bond (but that would only account for one carbonyl).

Wait, but a carboxylic acid has a carbonyl and an O-H. So that's two O's. Then where's the other carbonyl? Hmm, maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. Then, there would be the carboxylic acid (with O-H and carbonyl) and the double bond (which would show a peak around 1650). So that would fit the IR data.

So, the structure would be something like CH2=CHCOOH. But wait, that's C3H4O2. But our option C is C6H10O2. So perhaps a longer chain.

Wait, for example, CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH. That's C6H10O2. Let's check the formula: 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, 2 O's. Yes, that fits option C.

But wait, would that structure have the correct NMR and IR?

IR: broad O-H from carboxylic acid at ~3000 cm^-1. Carbonyl at ~1700 cm^-1. The double bond would have a peak around 1650 cm^-1. That matches the data.

NMR: presence of vinyl H (from the CH2=CH group). So, this fits.

Mass spec: the fragment at 45. Let's think about the possible fragments. If the molecule is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH, the mass is 116? No, wait, C6H10O2 has a molecular weight of 114. So the molecular ion would be 114. But the fragment at 45 could be from losing a larger group. For example, the carboxylic acid could lose CO2, but that would leave a fragment of 114-44=70. Not 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule breaks at the double bond. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the fragment at 45 could be the result of losing a CH2CH2COOH group. But that's 59, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the CH2=CHCH2- part. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the compound isn't a carboxylic acid but an ester with a double bond. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

If the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, the formula would be C6H10O2. Let's compute:

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3: that's (CH2=CHCOO) + (CH2CH2CH3). Wait, the ester part would be CH2=CHCOO-OCH2CH2CH3. So, that's (CH2=CHCOO-) and (OCH2CH2CH3). So, the formula is:

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3: 3 (from CH2=CHCOO) +3 (from OCH2CH2CH3)=6 C. Hydrogen: CH2=CHCOO has 5 H? Wait, let me count.

CH2=CHCOO-: each CH2 has 2 H, CH has 1, COO has O's. Wait, no, the structure would be CH2=CH-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. So:

CH2=CH: 2 (from CH2) +1 (from CH) =3 H.

COO: O's, no H.

OCH2CH2CH3: O connected to CH2CH2CH3, which has 7 H (each CH2 has 2, CH3 has 3; but the O is connected to first CH2, which has 2 H).

Wait, perhaps this is getting too detailed. But the main point is that the formula would be C6H10O2, which matches option C.

In this case, the IR would show the ester's carbonyl around 1700, and the conjugated double bond around 1650. The broad peak at 3000 would imply an O-H group, but in this structure, it's an ester, not a carboxylic acid. So where is the O-H? Oh wait, the ester doesn't have an O-H. So that would contradict the IR data.

Hmm, so that's a problem. If the IR shows a broad O-H, it must have a hydroxyl group. So the compound must be a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.

Wait, but an ester doesn't have an O-H. So if the IR has a broad O-H, it must be either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

So back to the structure. If the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, the formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C. So the structure would need to have both a double bond and a carboxylic acid group. Let's think about that structure.

For example, something like CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH with a double bond. Wait, but without the double bond, it would be a saturated carboxylic acid. But with a double bond, it would be an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid.

Wait, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH. That's 6 carbons, double bond, and a carboxylic acid group. The formula would be C6H10O2.

Let me check the IR:

- Broad O-H at 3000 cm^-1 (from carboxylic acid).
- Carbonyl at 1700 cm^-1.
- The double bond would show a peak around 1650 cm^-1.

The NMR would have vinyl H (from CH2=CH), and other peaks.

Mass spec: the fragment at 45. Let's think, the molecular ion is 114. If the molecule breaks into a fragment with 45, what could that be.

If the molecule is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH, maybe it loses the COOH group, but that would leave a fragment of 114-44=70 (COOH is 44). Not 45.

Alternatively, maybe it loses a larger fragment. For example, if the molecule breaks at the double bond, perhaps forming a fragment from the CH2=CH part and another from the rest.

CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH: if it breaks after the double bond, perhaps the fragment would be CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COO, which is 114-45=69. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe it's a McLafferty rearrangement or some other fragmentation. But I'm not an expert on mass spec.

Wait, another thought: the fragment at 45 is CH3COO- (acetate ion). The molecular weight of acetate is 43 (CH3COO- is C2H3O2^−). But the fragment is 45, which is two more. Hmm, maybe it's a protonated ion, like [CH3COOCH2]-? Not sure.

Alternatively, the fragment could be something else, like CH2CH2O (45? Let's calculate: C2H4O → 2*12=24, 4=4, 16=16. 24+4+16=44. Close, but not 45. But maybe it's CH2CH2O with a hydrogen somewhere else.

I'm getting stuck on the mass spec part. Let me try to think of another angle.

The possible options that fit the IR data (O-H and two carbonyls) and NMR (vinyl H) are options C and A.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation =1. So, either a ring or a double bond.

If it's a ring and a double bond, but the NMR shows vinyl H, so it has a double bond. So with one degree, perhaps a ring and a carbonyl.

But then the IR has two carbonyl peaks. So maybe a cyclic ketone with an ester group. Or a cyclic ester.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diester, but that would require more O's. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ketone with an ether group. Not sure.

But the O-H is present in the IR, so for option A, which has two O's, the O could be in both a carbonyl and an alcohol group. So maybe it's a diol with a carbonyl? Hmm, not sure.

But the IR shows two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650, which would suggest two carbonyl groups, which would require four O's, but option A has two. So that's not possible. Unless one of the peaks is from something else, like an aromatic ring.

Wait, the 1650 could be an aromatic ring's C=C. So if the compound is an aromatic ester with an O-H group.

Wait, for example, a phenolic ester. If the compound is something like phenyl acetate, but with a substituent that introduces a double bond.

Alternatively, if it's a substituted benzene ring with an ester group and a double bond.

But the formula for phenyl acetate is C8H8O2, which exceeds the options given.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternative approach: considering the mass spec. The fragment at 45 is key.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), what could be a fragment with 45? Let's calculate the possible fragment.

45 is 45 g/mol. Let me think about possible structures that could fragment into something with 45.

If the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, which is C6H10O2. Wait, no. The formula is C6H10O2, but the structure CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 would have 3+3=6 carbons but more hydrogens. Wait, let me count.

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3: CH2=CH (2 C), COO (2 C), CH2CH2CH3 (3 C). Wait, that's 2+2+3=7 C. Oh, that's more than 6. So that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2. No, that's too many.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclic structure. For example, a cyclic ester with a double bond.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is C6H10O2. Let's think about possible structures.

If it's a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond, the structure would be something like cyclopentene with an ester linkage. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diketone with an ester group, but that's getting too complicated.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a diethyl maleate or similar. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment at 45 is the (CH2)2O group. Wait, (CH2)2O is 44. Hmm, close. Maybe it's (CH2)2O with an extra H somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a ketene ion, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to recap.

The key clues are:

- FTIR: Broad O-H (carboxylic acid or alcohol), two carbonyls (maybe ester and conjugated double bond or something else).

- 1H NMR: Vinyl H → double bond.

- Mass spec: fragment m/z 45.

Options:

Only C and A have two O's, which would allow for two carbonyl groups or a carboxylic acid.

But for option A, the degrees of unsaturation are 1, which would be a double bond or a ring. With a double bond, but the IR would need two carbonyls, which may not fit.

Option C has two degrees of unsaturation, which could be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds. And with two O's, it could be a carboxylic acid and a double bond.

So I think the correct answer is C, C6H10O2, because:

- It has two O's for the O-H and two carbonyls (like a carboxylic acid and a conjugated double bond).

- The NMR shows vinyl H, so a double bond is present.

- The IR fits.

But wait, the mass spec fragment needs to make sense. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, and the fragment is 45, perhaps it's from the loss of a larger group, leaving a 45 fragment.

Wait, another approach: the molecular ion (M) is 114 (for option C). If it loses a 69 fragment, M - 69 =45.

But what would lose 69? 69 is the molecular weight of something like CH2=CHCOOH (which is 68, but maybe with an extra H). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule breaks into a 45 fragment and another part.

Wait, perhaps the molecule breaks into a CH2CH2O group (44) plus an H, giving m/z 45. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is an acylium ion. Acetone's molecular weight is 58. No, that's higher.

Hmm. I think I'm not entirely confident about the mass spec part, but based on the other data, option C seems the best fit.

To identify the unknown compound, the provided spectroscopic data and the given options were analyzed as follows:

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **FTIR Spectrum**:
   - A broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid or alcohol.
   - Strong absorption peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ indicate the presence of two carbonyl groups. The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is consistent with a carbonyl group (e.g., carboxylic acid or ester), while the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak could correspond to a conjugated carbonyl or a double bond.

2. **¹H NMR Spectrum**:
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens (H attached to a double bond) indicate the presence of an alkene in the structure.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests the presence of a common fragment, possibly related to CH₃COO⁻ (acetate ion) or a similar group.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂)**: This formula has a degree of unsaturation of 1, which could correspond to a double bond or a ring. However, the IR data suggests two carbonyl groups, which is inconsistent with this option. Additionally, the presence of a broad O-H peak implies a hydroxyl group, which is not possible with only one degree of unsaturation.
   - **Option B (C₆H₁₀O)**: This formula has only one oxygen, making it impossible to account for the two carbonyl peaks observed in the IR spectrum. This option is inconsistent with the data.
   - **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**: This formula has a degree of unsaturation of 2, which could correspond to a double bond and a ring. The two oxygen atoms allow for the presence of both a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group (e.g., a carboxylic acid). The IR data (broad O-H and two carbonyl peaks) and the NMR data (vinyl hydrogens) are consistent with this option. The mass spec fragment at m/z = 45 could correspond to a common fragment like CH₃COO⁻ or a related group.
   - **Option D (C₆H₁₂O)**: This formula has only one oxygen, making it impossible to account for the two carbonyl peaks observed in the IR spectrum. This option is inconsistent with the data.

### Conclusion:
Based on the spectroscopic data and the analysis of the options, the compound is most consistent with **C₆H₁₀O₂**. This formula accounts for the broad O-H peak, two carbonyl groups, the presence of vinyl hydrogens, and the fragment peak at m/z = 45.
