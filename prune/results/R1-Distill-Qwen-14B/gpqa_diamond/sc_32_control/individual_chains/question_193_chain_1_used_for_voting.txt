Okay, so I have this astronomy question here. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, which is 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are from A to D, with various exponents.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax plx is the reciprocal of distance. So, plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Or wait, is it the other way around? Oh right, parallax in parsecs is 1 over the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So d = 1/plx.

The number of stars N varies as 1/plx^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, we have N ∝ (d)^5. Because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how N changes with distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then as d increases, N increases rapidly. But the question is about the change in number per unit range of distance. Oh, right, that's the derivative part. Because when you're looking at how much N changes as you go from one distance to another, you're looking at the rate of change, which is dN/dr.

So, if N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr is proportional to 5d^4. Because the derivative of d^5 is 5d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases with d^4.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem states "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)." So, I think they're asking for dN/dr, the derivative. So if N ∝ d^5, then dN/dr ∝ d^4. So the change in number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4.

Looking at the options, option C is ~ r^4. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The number of stars as a function of parallax is 1/plx^5. So, when plx is small (which is when d is large), N is larger. But how does N change as you move a small distance dr? Like, if you look at an infinitesimal shell between r and r+dr, how many stars are in that shell?

In that case, the number of stars between r and r+dr would be proportional to the number density multiplied by the volume of that shell. Oh wait, but wait, this is in a specific region of the sky, so maybe it's not a volume but a surface density thing?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of surface density. Because in a region of the sky, you're looking at a certain area, and as you go further away, the number of stars in that area depends on their distribution.

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let's say that the number of stars within a certain volume is proportional to the volume times the density. But in this case, the question gives a relation between N and parallax, which is 1/plx^5.

But let's think about it differently. Let's express N as a function of distance. Since plx = 1/d, so 1/plx^5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but if N is the number of stars in a region, and you move from distance d to d + dr, how does N change? Or perhaps, the question is asking about the number per unit distance. So, the change in N per unit change in r is the derivative dN/dr, which is d/d(r) [d^5] = 5d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance at a distance r is proportional to r^4.

So the correct option would be C, which is ~ r^4.

Wait, but another way to think about this: the number of stars in a thin shell at radius r with thickness dr. The volume of that shell is 4πr² dr. If the number density is n, then the number of stars would be n * 4πr² dr. But in this problem, the number of stars is given as N ∝ 1/ plx^5 = d^5. That suggests that N is the cumulative number up to a certain distance, not the number in a shell.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's clarify. The problem says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

If N is the total number of stars up to a distance d, then the number of stars in a thin shell dr around d would be the derivative dN/dr, which is 5d^4. So per unit distance, the number of stars added is proportional to d^4.

So the answer would be option C, ~r^4.

The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( d \)) as \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), substituting this into the relation gives \( N \propto d^5 \). 

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)), we need to compute the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto d^5 \) with respect to \( d \), we find \( \frac{dN}{dd} \propto 5d^4 \). This indicates that the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).

Thus, the number of stars in the region of the sky changes with distance per unit range of distance as \( r^4 \). The correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
