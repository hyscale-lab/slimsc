Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, are being considered. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Let me read the details again. Both have the same mass. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Wait, so Planet_1 is closer to its star? Because shorter orbital period usually means closer orbit, right? Oh, right, because of Kepler's third law: P² is proportional to a³/(M+Ms), but since the star's mass is much larger, it's roughly a³. So Planet_1's period is P, Planet_2's is 3P.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Hmm, so Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but same radius. Wait, why would the star's mass affect transit probability? Well, the star's mass affects the planet's orbital distance, but since we have the same radii, the key factors are the planet's orbital distance and the size of the star.

The transit probability is given by the formula: R_s is the star's radius, a is the semi-major axis (so orbital distance), and R_p is the planet's radius. So the probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1 / a), I think. Or wait, no, the geometric probability is (R_p + R_s) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R_s, it's approximately (R_p / R_s) * (R_s / a)²? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think the transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits) depends on the size of the star and the distance of the planet's orbit. The formula is (R_*) / a, where R_* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis. Because the planet's orbital plane needs to be edge-on, which is a fraction of all possible orientations. Wait, no. Let me think again.

The geometric probability (the chance that the planet transits) is (R_p + R_*) / a, but since R_p << R_*, it's approximately (R_* / a) multiplied by some factor. Or wait, the probability is the ratio of the star's disk size relative to the planet's orbital distance. So it's (2 R_*) / (a) multiplied by (R_p / R_*)^2 — no, maybe not.

Wait, the probability of a transit is approximately (R_p / R_*)^2 multiplied by (R_* / a)^2 or something like that. Or perhaps it's (R_* / a) * (R_p / R_*). Let me get this right.

I think the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_*)² multiplied by (R_* / a). Because the area of the star is π(R_*)², and the area where the planet can block the star is a circle of radius a, but wait, that's not accurate because the planet's orbital distance is a, so the area it can cover is a circle of radius a (from the star's perspective). So the probability is the ratio of the areas: (π R_p²) / (π a²) × (something about the alignment). Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me look up the formula. Oh wait, the transit probability is the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. So the formula is (R_* / a)^2 multiplied by something else. Alternatively, the probability is (R_p / R_*)² × (R_* / a) × something else. Hmm.

Wait, I think I remember that the transit probability is (R_p / R_*)² multiplied by the geometric probability, which is (R_* / a). So geometric probability is (R_* / a) because the planet has to cross the star's disk, which is a small solid angle relative to the orbit. So the probability of transit is (R_p / R_*)² multiplied by (R_* / a). Wait, no, the geometric probability is (R_* / a) multiplied by something else.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the planet’s orbit circle. The area of the star is πR_*(R_*). The area of the orbit is πa². So the probability would be (π R_*²) / (π a²) ) = (R_* / a)^2. But that can't be right because then the probability would be very small for most planets, which is correct, but I'm not considering the planet's size.

Wait, no. Because the planet has to pass in front of the star, so the effective area is the star's disk. Wait, actually, the transit probability is the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The formula for the geometric probability is (R_* / a), which is the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance.

But wait, that's just the geometric probability. Then, considering the planet's size, the observed depth is (R_p / R_*)^2, but the probability of transit (whether it transits at all) is (R_* / a) multiplied by something else. Or perhaps the probability is (R_* / a) multiplied by (R_p / R_*), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is (R_p / R_*)^2 multiplied by (R_* / a). No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the probability is (R_p / R_*)^2 multiplied by (R_* / a), but the units don't make sense. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the transit probability is the product of two factors: the probability that the orbital plane is aligned (geometric probability) and the fraction of the star's disk that the planet covers (which affects the depth, but not the probability of transit itself). Wait, no, the geometric probability is the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned so that it transits. So the geometric probability is given by (R_* + R_p) / a. But since R_p << R_*, it's approximately R_* / a.

Wait, but if a is much larger than R_*, which it is, then R_* / a is a small number. So the probability is proportional to (R_* / a). So for the same star, a planet closer in (smaller a) has a higher chance of transiting. But wait, in this question, Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period. So using Kepler's third law, a is proportional to (P^2 * M_star)^(1/3). Wait, so a is proportional to (P^2 * M_star)^(1/3).

Let me compute the semi-major axes for both planets.

Given that Planet_1 has a period P, and Planet_2 has 3P.

The mass of Planet_1's star is twice that of Planet_2's. So M1 = 2 M2.

Using Kepler's law: (a³) / (P²) = G(M + m) / (4π²). Since m (planet mass) is negligible compared to M, a^3 = (G M P^2) / (4π²). So a is proportional to (M * P^2)^(1/3).

So for Planet_1:

a1 ∝ (M1 * P^2)^(1/3) = (2 M2 * P²)^(1/3) = (2)^(1/3) * (M2 P²)^(1/3).

For Planet_2:

a2 ∝ (M2 * (3P)^2)^(1/3) = (M2 * 9 P²)^(1/3) = (9)^(1/3) * (M2 P²)^(1/3).

So the ratio a1/a2 is (2^(1/3) ) / (9^(1/3)) ) = (2/9)^(1/3) = (2)/(9^(1/3)).

Wait, 9 is 3², so 9^(1/3) is 3^(2/3) ≈ 2.08. So 2/(2.08) is approximately 0.96. So a1 is about 0.96 times a2.

Wait, but that's a bit rough. Alternatively, let's compute it more precisely.

Compute a1 / a2 = [ (2 M2 P^2 ) / ( M2 (3P)^2 ) ]^(1/3) 

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (2) / (9) ) ]^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.2222)^(0.333) ≈ 0.608.

So a1 is about 0.608 times a2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2 is to its.

Wait, that's because Planet_1 has a shorter period but a more massive star. Let me make sure.

If M is bigger, for the same period, a would be bigger, because a^3 is proportional to M P². So for Planet_1, M is 2M, P is P. For Planet_2, M is M, P is 3P. So a1^3 is proportional to 2 M * P², a2^3 is proportional to M * (3P)^2 = M * 9 P². So a1^3/a2^3 = (2 M P²) / (9 M P²) ) = 2/9. So a1 is (2/9)^(1/3) times a2, which is about 0.608 a2.

So Planet_1 is closer in, so a is smaller. So since the transit probability is proportional to R_* / a, and both stars have same R_*, then the probability is inversely proportional to a.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is (R_* / a1) and for Planet_2 it's (R_* / a2). So P1/P2 = (R_*/a1)/(R_*/a2) = a2/a1 = 1/(a1/a2) = 1/(0.608) ≈ 1.645.

So Planet_1's transit probability is about 1.645 times that of Planet_2. So Planet_1 is preferred because its probability is higher.

Wait, but wait another thing. The transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_*)^2, but since both planets are Earth-like, their radii are the same, and both host stars have the same R_*, so that factor is the same for both. So the only difference is the a, the semi-major axis.

Wait, but I thought the transit probability is (R_* / a) × (R_p / R_*)^2. Or is it just (R_* / a) multiplied by another factor?

Wait, I think the transit probability is the geometric probability, which is the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits. That's (R_* + R_p) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R_*, it's approximately (R_* / a). So the probability is higher when a is smaller, because R_* is same for both.

So for Planet_1, a is smaller, so (R_* / a1) is larger than (R_* / a2) → P1 transit probability is higher than P2.

Wait, but let me compute the exact ratio.

a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2 ≈ 0.608 a2.

So (R_* / a1) / (R_* / a2) = a2 /a1 → 1 / 0.608 ≈ 1.645.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is approximately 1.645 times higher than for Planet_2.

So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1 because it has a higher transit probability.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Option D says 2.7 times, which is much higher, but our calculation is about 1.65.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To determine which planet has the higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability is proportional to the geometric probability, which is given by:

\[
P_{\text{transit}} \propto \frac{R_*}{a}
\]

where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star, and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the key factor influencing the transit probability is the semi-major axis (\( a \)).

### Step 1: Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis (\( a \)) is proportional to:

\[
a \propto \left( M \cdot P^2 \right)^{1/3}
\]

where \( M \) is the mass of the host star, and \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

- Planet_1 has an orbital period \( P \) and a host star mass \( M_1 = 2M_2 \).
- Planet_2 has an orbital period \( 3P \) and a host star mass \( M_2 \).

The ratio of their semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{M_1 \cdot P^2}{M_2 \cdot (3P)^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2M_2 \cdot P^2}{M_2 \cdot 9P^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.608
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.608 \cdot a_2 \), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its host star than Planet_2.

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis (\( a \)). Therefore, the ratio of the transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_{\text{transit,1}}}{P_{\text{transit,2}}} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.608} \approx 1.645
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1. Among the options provided, the correct choice is:

**C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**
