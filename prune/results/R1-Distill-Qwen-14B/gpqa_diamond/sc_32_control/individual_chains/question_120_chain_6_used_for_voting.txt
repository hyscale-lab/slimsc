Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says to assume stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, what does that mean exactly? Oh right, uniform distribution would mean that the number density of stars is the same throughout space. So, there's no clustering, just evenly spread out.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Because parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So, a star at distance d has parallax plx = 1/d (in parsecs, I think).

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. Let me think about this. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (n) is constant. So, n = number of stars per unit volume.

But how does this relate to parallax? Let's see. The number of stars in a certain volume would depend on the distance. Because when you look at a certain range of parallax, you're effectively looking at a shell in space.

Let me model this. Let's consider a thin spherical shell at a distance d, with thickness dd. The volume of this shell would be the surface area of a sphere with radius d multiplied by the thickness dd. The surface area is 4πd², so the volume is 4πd² dd.

But since parallax plx is 1/d (plx in arcseconds, d in parsecs), so d = 1/plx. So substituting, the volume is 4π*(1/plx)^2 * (dd). But wait, plx is a variable here; we're considering a small range of plx, say from plx to plx + dplx. So, the corresponding d is from 1/plx to 1/(plx + dplx). Hmm, but for small changes, d can be approximated as 1/plx, and the change in d would be a small fraction.

Wait, maybe I should express the volume in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, then dd is the derivative of d with respect to plx. So, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. So, the volume elements would be in terms of plx.

So, the volume element in terms of plx is 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx²) dplx ). Wait, but since we're considering a small change in plx, the negative can be handled with limits. So, the number of stars in a shell at parallax plx is n (number density) multiplied by the volume of the shell.

Putting it all together: dN = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. Because the volume element is 4πd² dd, which is 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx²) dplx ), but since we're considering a small positive dplx, we take the absolute value, so it's 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, no wait. Let me think again. The volume of the shell at distance d is 4πd² dd. But since d = 1/plx, then dd = -d/(plx²) dplx. So the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - d/(plx²) dplx ) → but wait, d is 1/plx, so plugging that in:

Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx) )/(plx²) ) dplx.

Wait, let me compute that. So, 1/plx squared is (1/plx)^2, multiplied by (1/plx) because dd is - (1/plx²) dplx. So, 4π * (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. Because the overall factor is positive, as we're considering a small dplx increase. So, the volume is 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Then, the number of stars in that shell is n times this volume, so dN = 4π n (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, the number of stars per unit parallax (dN/dplx) is 4π n / plx^4.

But the question is about the number per unit range of plx, which is dN/dplx. So, it's proportional to 1/plx^4. That's option A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes these problems involve integrating over a range, but here it's a differential. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Another approach: The number density is n = number per unit volume. So, in a thin shell between d and d+dd, the number of stars is n * 4π d² dd.

Express everything in terms of plx (p = 1/d).

So, d = 1/p → dd = - (1/p²) dp.

So, the number of stars is n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (-1/p²) dp.

But since dp is positive when p decreases, but we're considering the number in a shell, we take the magnitude. So, the number is n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Thus, the number of stars per unit parallax (dN/dp) is (4π n)/p^4 → proportional to 1/p^4.

So, that's option A: ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the density is uniform, so the number of stars in a volume increases with volume. But since the volume increases with distance squared, but the number of stars per unit parallax is considering how the shells at different distances contribute.

Wait, perhaps another way: The number of stars with parallax between p and p+dp is N(p) dp = n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp = 4π n /p^4 dp. So, N(p) ~ 1/p^4.

Yes, that makes sense. So the number per unit p decreases as p^4.

But wait, wait a second. Let me think about the density of stars. If there are n stars per cubic parsec, then in a volume V, you have N = n V.

For a thin shell at distance d, thickness dd, the volume is V=4πd² dd. So, N = n * 4π d² dd.

But in terms of parallax p, d=1/p, so V=4π (1/p)^2 * (-1/p² dp) ) = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So, the number of stars per unit p is n * 4π / p^4. So, it's proportional to 1/p^4.

Therefore, the correct option is A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, \( n \), is constant throughout space. The goal is to relate the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at a distance \( d \) to the parallax \( \text{plx} \), where \( \text{plx} = 1/d \) (in parsecs).

The volume of a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is given by:

\[
V = 4\pi d^2 \, dd
\]

Since \( \text{plx} = 1/d \), we can express \( d \) as \( d = 1/\text{plx} \). Substituting this into the volume formula, we get:

\[
V = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \, dd
\]

To express \( dd \) in terms of \( \text{plx} \), we note that \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} \). Substituting this into the volume formula:

\[
V = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \, d\text{plx}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
V = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \, d\text{plx}
\]

The number of stars in this shell is then:

\[
dN = n \cdot V = n \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \, d\text{plx}
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is:

\[
\frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \text{plx}^{-4} \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/\text{plx}^4**
