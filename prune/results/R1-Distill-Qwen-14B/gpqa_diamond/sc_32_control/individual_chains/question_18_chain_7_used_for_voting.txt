Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

So the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let me read the details again.

Star_1 has a mass of 1.5 times the Sun, and Star_2 is 1.2 times. But wait, I don't think the mass directly affects the abundance ratios because the problem gives me the [X/Fe] and [X/H] values. So maybe the masses are just extra info.

The given abundances are:

For Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex and [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex.

For Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex.

Oh, right, the solar photosphere is given too. The Sun has 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and same for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7.

Wait, what's the notation here? The [X/Y] notation is log10(nX/nY), right? So [Fe/H] is the logarithm of the ratio of iron to hydrogen compared to the Sun.

Let me jot that down.

First, Solar values:

log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So that means log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg, log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5, so nMg/nH =10^-5.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me clarify. When the problem says 12 + log10(...) = value, that's a standard notation. So for the Sun,

log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5 = around 3.16e-5.

Wait, wait, 10^(-4.5) is 3.16e-5.

Same for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But the problem is about the ratio of silicon in the two stars. So I need to find nSi/nH for each star and then take the ratio.

But how? Let's see the given data.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. This is log10(nSi/nFe) =0.3. So nSi/nFe =10^0.3 ≈ 2.

Also, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → log10(nFe/nH) =0 → nFe/nH =1.

So from Star_1's [Fe/H], Fe is same as sun? Or wait, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H)/(Fe/Sun H?), no. Wait, no, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (nFe/nH) / (nFe/nH)_sun.

So [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun.

If [Fe/H]_1 is 0, then log(nFe/nH)_1 = log(nFe/nH)_sun → so nFe/nH is same as Sun.

Which for the Sun, as computed, nFe/nH =1e-4.5 ≈3.16e-5.

So for Star_1, nFe/nH =3.16e-5.

And from [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi/nFe) =0.3 → nSi/nFe=10^0.3≈2.

So nSi = nFe * 2.

But since nFe is 3.16e-5 * nH, then nSi = 2 * 3.16e-5 * nH =6.32e-5 * nH.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me structure this.

For Star_1:

nFe = (3.16e-5) * nH.

nSi = nFe * 10^0.3 → nFe ≈3.16e-5 → nSi ≈3.16e-5 * 2 =6.32e-5 nH.

Wait, but wait, [Si/Fe] is log10(nSi/nFe) =0.3 → nSi/nFe=10^0.3≈2. So nSi =2*nFe.

And since nFe = 3.16e-5 * nH, then nSi=2*3.16e-5 *nH ≈6.32e-5 nH.

So, for Star_1, nSi/nH ≈6.32e-5.

Now, for Star_2.

The given data is [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 dex and [Mg/H]_2=0 dex.

Hmm, same approach.

First, [Mg/H]_2=0 → log10(nMg/nH) = log10(nMg/nH)_sun → same as Sun. So nMg/nH =1e-5.

So nMg =1e-5 *nH.

Now, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log10(nMg/nSi)=0.3 → nMg/nSi=10^0.3≈2 → nSi= nMg/2.

nMg is 1e-5 *nH → so nSi= (1e-5 * nH)/2 =5e-6 nH.

Wait, let me write it step by step.

For Star_2:

nMg =1e-5 *nH.

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg/nSi)=0.3 → nMg= nSi *10^0.3 ≈2 *nSi.

So, rearranged, nSi =nMg /10^0.3 → which is ≈nMg /2.

nMg is 1e-5 *nH → nSi= (1e-5 *nH)/2 → 5e-6 *nH.

So nSi/nH for Star_2 is 5e-6.

Wait a second, but wait: [Mg/Si] is log(nMg/nSi) =0.3 → nMg/nSi=2 → nSi =nMg/2.

Yes.

So, nSi for Star_2 is 5e-6 nH.

Now, the question is the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.

So (nSi_1)/(nSi_2) = (6.32e-5) / (5e-6) = (6.32e-5)/(5e-6) = (6.32/5) * 10^( -5 +6 ) = (1.264) *10^1 →≈12.64.

But wait, let me compute it again:

6.32e-5 is 6.32 ×10^-5.

5e-6 is 5 ×10^-6.

Divide 6.32e-5 by 5e-6:

(6.32 /5) = 1.264.

10^(-5)/10^(-6) =10^(1) → multiply 1.264 by 10 →12.64.

So the ratio is approximately 12.64, which is close to option B, ~12.6.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the steps.

Star_1: [Si/Fe]=0.3 → nSi=2 *nFe.

nFe=3.16e-5 *nH.

So nSi= 6.32e-5 *nH → correct.

Star_2: [Mg/Si]=0.3 → nMg=2 *nSi.

nMg=1e-5 *nH → so nSi=(1e-5)/(2) =5e-6 nH.

So the ratio is (6.32e-5)/(5e-6) = approx 12.64.

So the answer should be B) ~12.6.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ~12.6, which matches.

To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and solar photospheric compositions.

### Solar Photospheric Composition
For the Sun:
- \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 \)  
  Thus, \( n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-4.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-5} \).
- \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7 - 12 = -5 \)  
  Thus, \( n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \).

### Star_1
For Star_1:
- \( [\text{Si/Fe}]_1 = 0.3 \)  
  \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Fe}}) = 0.3 \)  
  \( n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Fe}} = 10^{0.3} \approx 2 \).  
  Since \( n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} = 3.16 \times 10^{-5} \),  
  \( n_{\text{Si}} = 2 \times n_{\text{Fe}} = 2 \times (3.16 \times 10^{-5}) \times n_{\text{H}} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-5} \times n_{\text{H}} \).
- \( [\text{Fe/H}]_1 = 0 \)  
  This confirms \( n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} = 3.16 \times 10^{-5} \), consistent with the Sun.

### Star_2
For Star_2:
- \( [\text{Mg/Si}]_2 = 0.3 \)  
  \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}}) = 0.3 \)  
  \( n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}} = 10^{0.3} \approx 2 \).  
  Since \( n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \),  
  \( n_{\text{Si}} = n_{\text{Mg}} / 2 = (10^{-5} \times n_{\text{H}}) / 2 = 5 \times 10^{-6} \times n_{\text{H}} \).
- \( [\text{Mg/H}]_2 = 0 \)  
  This confirms \( n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \), consistent with the Sun.

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is:  
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{6.32 \times 10^{-5}}{5 \times 10^{-6}} = \frac{6.32}{5} \times 10^{1} \approx 1.264 \times 10 \approx 12.64.
\]

Thus, the ratio is approximately **12.6**, corresponding to option **B**.

Answer: B
