Okay, so I've got this question about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but let me think through this.

First, I remember that symmetry in molecules refers to the different ways the molecule can look the same after certain operations, like rotations or reflections. The C3h symmetry group... wait, what's that again? Oh right, C3h is a type of molecular symmetry that includes a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So the molecule should look the same after being rotated 120 degrees around the C3 axis and also have a mirror plane that's horizontal.

Looking at the options, I have four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone, and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. The options are labeled A, B, C, D.

Let me go through each one.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. Its structure is (i-Pr)3B, right? Triisopropyl groups attached to boron. Each isopropyl group is symmetric, but does the whole molecule have C3 symmetry? Well, the boron is at the center, and each isopropyl is identical. So rotating 120 degrees around the boron should map the molecule onto itself. But what about the mirror plane? I'm not so sure. Wait, triisopropyl borate is known to have a trigonal planar structure around B, so it has C3 symmetry. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm, mirror planes... I think in this case, the molecule might not. Because looking from the top (along the C3 axis), the mirror plane would be perpendicular to the rotation axis. Wait, no, the horizontal mirror plane (σh) is parallel to the rotation axis. So for C3h, the molecule should have a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, I think triisopropyl borate actually only has C3 symmetry, not C3h. Because the mirror plane would be in a plane that's perpendicular to the C3 axis. Or maybe not. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should move on and come back.

Option D is quinuclidine. Quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclic molecule, with a bridge structure. I remember it has a chair-like conformation, but what's its symmetry? Quinuclidine has a C3 axis, right? Because you can rotate it 120 degrees around an axis through the bridge, and it looks the same. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm, the molecule is not planar, so a mirror plane would require reflection symmetry. Quinuclidine is chiral, isn't it? Wait, wait, no. No, wait. Quinuclidine has a plane of symmetry. Because the structure is symmetric. Let me think: looking at the structure, the molecule has a bridge, and substituents symmetrically placed. So when you look at it, there's a mirror plane that goes through the bridge. Wait, but maybe it's a vertical mirror plane, not horizontal. So the presence of a σh would require that the mirror is horizontal, which I'm not sure about. Alternatively, maybe quinuclidine has C3 symmetry without the horizontal mirror. So perhaps it's C3, not C3h. So maybe D isn't the right answer.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-... something. Wait, that name sounds familiar. It's a tricyclic compound with three furan rings fused together. Let me visualize it. Benzo... so one of the rings is a benzene, but wait, wait, no, the substituents are fused as benzo. Wait, the nomenclature is a bit confusing. Alternatively, it's a trifuran system with benzo substituents. I'm not certain, but I think this structure might have a plane of symmetry. What about the rotation? Suppose the molecule has a central part that allows 120-degree rotation. Alternatively, perhaps it's more of a D3h symmetry? Or maybe just C3.

Alternatively, maybe this molecule has a threefold axis, but not necessarily a horizontal mirror plane. Hmm.

Option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-... something. Triphenylene... that's a tricyclic structure with three benzene rings connected in a way that gives a high degree of symmetry. Wait, I remember that triphenylene has a threefold axis of symmetry. So if it's connected with a trifuran system, maybe the entire molecule has a C3 axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, for C3h symmetry, the presence of a horizontal mirror would make the molecule non-chiral. So if a molecule has a C3h symmetry, it must also have a plane of symmetry. Let me think about each option.

Triisopropyl borate: C3 symmetry but does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the mirror plane is perpendicular to the C3 axis, that's a vertical plane, not horizontal. The horizontal plane would be parallel to the rotation axis. So for a trigonal planar molecule, like (i-Pr)3B, the mirror plane would be perpendicular to the rotation axis (i.e., vertical). So the symmetry would be D3, not C3h. Because D3 includes C3 and σ (a vertical mirror), which would make the symmetry include a horizontal mirror if it's another operation. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the types. Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate has C3v symmetry, which includes a vertical mirror plane, not a horizontal one. So in that case, it doesn't have C3h.

Then, looking at quinuclidine: I think its symmetry is C3, not C3h. Because the mirror plane is vertical, not horizontal. So again, it wouldn't have the σh.

What about the other two options, B and A. Let's consider the structure of option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran. I think this structure is a tricyclic system with three furan rings arranged in a way that each is connected to a benzene ring. Wait, no, the 'benzo' prefix suggests a benzene ring fused to a furan. Alternatively, perhaps it's a system where the three furan moieties are connected in a way that allows for threefold symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe it's similar to benzotrifuran, which has a certain symmetry. Let's try to visualize: if the molecule has three identical substituents arranged symmetrically around a central point, that might give C3 symmetry. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran. Triphenylene is a symmetric molecule, and when attached to a trifuran, perhaps it imparts a higher symmetry. Triphenylene itself is a symmetric molecule with a threefold axis. So when fused with a trifuran, the entire molecule might have a threefold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, if the molecule is such that when rotated 120 degrees, it looks the same, and there's a horizontal mirror plane, then it would have C3h symmetry. So which of the options fits that?

I'm trying to imagine the structures. Triphenylene is a tricyclic compound with three benzene rings arranged in a symmetric fashion. So when attached to a trifuran (three fused furan rings), perhaps the overall structure has C3h symmetry. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged such that a horizontal mirror plane exists, that would make the symmetry C3h.

Wait, another approach: which of these molecules are known for having C3h symmetry? Triphenylene has a threefold axis but what about mirror planes? I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option A.

Let me think about the other options. Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (option A) has the triphenylene part, which is a highly symmetric structure. So when combined with a trifuran system, maybe the entire molecule has multiple planes of symmetry, including a horizontal one.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the orbit of the substituents. If the substituents are arranged such that a rotation and a reflection would map the molecule onto itself, that would imply C3h.

Wait, another approach: think about the options and which ones are more likely to have C3h symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate: Probably just C3 symmetry, without the horizontal mirror.

Quinuclidine: Probably C3 symmetry as well, but does it have a horizontal mirror? Quinuclidine is also chair-like, but I'm not sure about the mirror. I think it's C3.

Option B: The benzo part would introduce a benzene ring, which has D6h symmetry, but when combined with the trifuran, perhaps it has lower symmetry. Maybe C3.

Option A: Triphenylene is a symmetric structure, and when attached to a trifuran, which also has some symmetry, perhaps it results in C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, another thought: the presence of a horizontal mirror plane (σh) would require that the molecule is symmetric across a plane that's horizontal relative to the rotation axis. So if the molecule has a threefold axis, and a mirror plane that's perpendicular to that axis (vertical), then it's C3v. If the mirror plane is horizontal, it's C3h.

So, which of these structures has a threefold axis and a horizontal mirror?

Hmm. Triphenylene-based molecules might have multiple mirror planes, including a horizontal one. So perhaps option A.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let's think about the other option, option B. Benzo... would that structure have a threefold axis? If the rings are arranged in a way that allows a threefold rotation, then yes. But with a benzene ring, which is six-membered, perhaps the symmetry is lower.

Alternatively, maybe benzo[...]trifuran would have a lower symmetry than triphenylene-based structures.

Wait, another approach: the question is about which has C3h symmetry. C3h implies that the molecule has a threefold rotation and a horizontal mirror. So, for a molecule to have both, it must look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also be symmetric across a horizontal plane.

Which of these structures fulfills that?

Triphenylene is a planar molecule with a threefold axis. Maybe when it's attached to a trifuran, which is also planar, the overall molecule remains planar, thus allowing for a horizontal mirror plane (which in planar molecules is often the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis). Or wait, in planar molecules, the horizontal mirror would actually be a vertical plane in some contexts. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of specific examples. I remember that triphenylene itself has a threefold rotation axis and also a horizontal mirror plane. So when you attach substituents symmetrically around it, the overall symmetry could be C3h.

Therefore, option A, which is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran, would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but what about the furan rings? If the substituents are attached in a way that maintains the symmetry, then yes. So I'm leaning towards option A being the correct answer.

To determine which molecule has **C₃h symmetry**, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry properties. **C₃h symmetry** includes a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). The molecule must look the same after a 120° rotation around the C₃ axis and also be symmetric across a horizontal plane.

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Option C: Triisopropyl Borate**  
   Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar structure around the central boron atom, giving it **C₃ symmetry**. However, it lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh), as the mirror planes are vertical. Therefore, it does not have **C₃h symmetry**.

2. **Option D: Quinuclidine**  
   Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a three-fold rotation axis (C₃). However, its symmetry is not **C₃h** because it does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Instead, it has vertical mirror planes, making its symmetry **C₃v**, not **C₃h**.

3. **Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**  
   This molecule is a tricyclic structure with a benzo ring fused to a trifuran system. While it may have some symmetry, the fusion of the benzo ring disrupts the higher symmetry required for **C₃h**. The structure does not simultaneously satisfy the conditions for a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

4. **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**  
   Triphenylene is a highly symmetric tricyclic molecule with a three-fold rotation axis (C₃). When fused with a trifuran system, the overall structure retains the three-fold rotation axis and includes a horizontal mirror plane (σh). This combination satisfies the conditions for **C₃h symmetry**.

### Conclusion:
The molecule that exhibits **C₃h symmetry** is **triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**.
