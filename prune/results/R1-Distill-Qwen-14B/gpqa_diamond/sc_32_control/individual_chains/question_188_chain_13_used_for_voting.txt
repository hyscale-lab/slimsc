Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state physics, but let's try to think this through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm.

Rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So in this case, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees each. Wait, but wait—interatomic distance, that's the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice vectors, so that's the a parameter in the crystal structure. So a = 10 Angstroms here.

The interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) in a crystal is given by the formula 1/d = |(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) - (hk + hl + kl)/(a^2 cos θ)|, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember there's another formula involving the Miller indices and the structure factors. Oh wait, perhaps the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system is different.

Wait, wait, I think the general formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} in a crystal is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha) } } 

But wait, for a rhombohedral crystal, all the angles are the same, so α=β=γ=θ=30 degrees. So cos α, cos β, and cos γ are all equal to cos 30°, which is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So substituting θ=30°, and for the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1.

Let me plug these into the formula. So,

d = 1 / sqrt( (1^2 +1^2 +1^2) - 2*(1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30) )

Simplify the numerator:

1^2 +1^2 +1^2 = 3.

The second part: 2*(1*1 * cos30 * 3 terms, since each term is hk cosθ, but all h, k, l are 1, so each term is 1*1* cos30. So 3 terms of 1*1*cos30. So 2*(3 * cos30) = 6 cos30.

So the denominator inside the sqrt becomes: 3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 - 3*sqrt(3).

Wait, let me compute that:

3 - 3*sqrt(3) = 3*(1 - sqrt(3)).

Wait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732. So 1 - 1.732 = -0.732. So 3*( -0.732 ) = -2.196.

Wait, but that can't be right because the denominator inside the sqrt would be negative, which would make the sqrt undefined. That can't happen. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me double-check. Another approach: the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral system can also be calculated using the formula:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl)(1 - cos θ)} }

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Another formula I remember is:

d = a * sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (2 hk cos γ + 2 hl cos β + 2 kl cos α) )^{-1}

Wait, no, perhaps I should look for the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

Wait, another resource I remember says that for a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl)(1 - cosθ) } }

But wait, that seems different from what I had earlier. So let's try this approach.

Given that, for the (111) plane, h=k=l=1, and θ=30 degrees.

So compute the denominator:

h² + k² + l² = 1+1+1 =3.

Then, the cross terms: 2*(hk + hl + kl) = 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) )= 2*(3) )=6.

Each term in (hk + hl + kl) is 1, and there are three terms, so sum is 3. Multiply by 2 gives 6.

Then, (1 - cosθ) = 1 - cos(30 degrees) = 1 - (√3/2) ≈ 1 - 0.866 = 0.13397.

So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 6*(0.13397)).

Compute 6 * 0.13397 ≈ 0.8038.

So total inside sqrt is 3 + 0.8038 = 3.8038.

So d = a / sqrt(3.8038).

Since a is 10 Angstroms.

Compute sqrt(3.8038): Let's see, 1.95^2 = 3.8025, which is very close to 3.8038. So sqrt ≈ 1.9508.

So d ≈ 10 / 1.9508 ≈ 5.125 Angstroms. Wait, that's not matching any of the options. The options are around 8.9 to 10 Angstroms.

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the reciprocal lattice.

Wait, another approach: in a cubic system, the interplanar distance is a/sqrt(h² +k² +l²), but for a rhombohedral system, it's more complicated because of the angles.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl)(1 - cosθ) } }

Wait, but earlier when I tried that, I got d ≈5.125, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps I should recall the general formula for interplanar distance in a general crystal system. The general formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\alpha) } } * (a^2/(a*b*c))^{1/2} }

Wait, but perhaps that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I think the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\alpha) }} * (a^2/(a^2))^{1/2} )

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) } }

Hmm, let me try that.

So in our case, all angles are 30 degrees, and a = 10.

So for (111), h=k=l=1:

Numerator: a =10.

Denominator inside sqrt: 3 - 2*(1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30).

So that's 3 - 2*(3 * 0.8660) = 3 - 2*(2.598) = 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, the denominator is sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. That can't be right. So this approach must be wrong.

Hmm, what's going on here. Maybe I have the formula wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another formula specific to rhombohedral systems.

Wait, I remember that in a rhombohedral system, the lattice can be considered as a special case of a hexagonal system, but no, that's probably not right. Alternatively, perhaps treating it as a cubic system but with a distortion. Wait, but in that case, the interplanar distance formula for cubic would give d = a/sqrt(3) ≈ 5.77 Angstroms, which still isn't matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the rhombohedral system as a unit cell with vectors a, a, a, and angles 30 degrees. But maybe the interplanar distance isn't just a function of a and the angles; perhaps I'm missing the Miller indices correctly.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the conventional formula. Let me think again. The formula for interplanar spacing in a general hexagonal system is different, but rhombohedral is a different system.

Wait, here's another approach. The interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral crystal can be found using the formula:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ } }

Wait, but that would only be the case if the angles between the vectors are all the same, which they are in the rhombohedral case.

Wait, but in that case, for (111):

d = a / sqrt( (1+1+1) - 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) cosθ )

Which is sqrt(3) in the numerator inside the square root.

So:

3 - 2*(3)*cos30 = 3 -6*(√3/2) = 3 -3√3.

Hmm, same as before, which gives a negative denominator. So again, same problem.

Wait, but that can't be. Maybe because in the rhombohedral system, the formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl)(1 - cosθ) } }

Wait, let me compute that.

So, in this case, h=k=l=1, θ=30°, a=10.

Compute h² +k² +l² =3.

Then, 2*(hk + hl + kl) = 2*(3) =6.

1 - cos30 = 0.13397.

So 6 * 0.13397 = 0.8038.

So the denominator inside the square root is 3 + 0.8038 = 3.8038.

So sqrt(3.8038) is approximately 1.95.

So d = 10 / 1.95 ≈5.128 Angstroms.

But looking at the options, the choices are all around 8-10, so 5.128 is way off. So I'm definitely missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the rhombohedral system is a special case of the hexagonal system? Or maybe the formula I'm using is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the unit cell parameters. Maybe the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is different. Wait, another approach: in a rhombohedral system, the lattice is a cube that's been skewed. So perhaps the unit cell can be described with a, a, a, and angles α=β=γ=30°, but I'm not sure how that affects the interplanar distance.

Wait, perhaps I should use the general formula for the interplanar distance in a cubic system, but with modified terms due to the angles. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I found a formula online before. Oh wait, no, I can't refer to external resources. Let me think.

Another approach: the interplanar distance d is given by the reciprocal of the norm of the reciprocal lattice vectors.

In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors can be calculated, but this might be getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for d in terms of the unit cell vectors.

Wait, the general formula for d_{hkl} is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\alpha) } } * (a^2/(a^2))^{1/2} }

Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\alpha) } }

But that brings me back to the same problem as before, leading to a negative inside the sqrt.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula. Maybe I have the sign wrong. Perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\alpha) } }

Wait, in that case, for (111):

Denominator would be sqrt(3 + 2*(3 * cos30)).

Cos30 is ~0.866. So 3 * 0.866 ≈ 2.598.

Multiply by 2 gives 5.196.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 +5.196 =8.196.

sqrt(8.196) is approximately 2.86.

So d=10 / 2.86 ≈3.496 Angstroms. Still not matching the options.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. What if I instead consider that the formula I'm using is incorrect, and perhaps I should use a different approach, like the volume approach.

Wait, the volume of the unit cell in a rhombohedral system is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3cosθ + 3cos^2θ/2). Wait, not sure. Alternatively, volume V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cosθ + (3/2) cos^2θ) )?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try another approach. The interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal can be found using the formula:

d = a / sqrt(3 - 6 cosθ + 6 cos^2θ )

Wait, perhaps that's a formula specific to rhombohedral (111) planes.

Let me try that.

θ is 30°, a=10.

So compute 3 -6 cos30 +6 cos^2(30).

Compute each term:

cos30 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So 6 cos30 = 6*(0.8660) ≈5.196.

6 cos^2(30) =6*(3/4) )= 6*(0.75) =4.5.

So 3 -5.196 +4.5 =3 -5.196 is -2.196 +4.5 = 2.304.

So denominator is sqrt(2.304) ≈1.518.

So d=10 /1.518 ≈6.59 Angstroms. Still not matching any options.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt(3 - 6 cosθ + 6 cos^2θ ) but wait, perhaps it's 3 + 6 cosθ + 6 cos^2θ.

Wait, let's compute 3 +6 cos30 +6 cos^2(30) =3 +5.196 +4.5=12.696. sqrt is ~3.564. So d=10/3.564≈2.809 Angstroms. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( 3 - 6 cosθ + 6 cos^2θ )

Wait, same as before, which gave me 6.59.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let's think about the options provided. All options are around 9 Angstroms except D, which is 10.05. But my earlier attempts gave me much lower values. Did I perhaps confuse a with something else?

Wait, in the question, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. But in a rhombohedral system, the parameter a is the length of the lattice vectors. So a=10 Angstroms. So I think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for interplanar distance in terms of the structure factor, but that's probably a stretch.

Wait, another approach: For a cubic system, the interplanar distance is a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). For a (111) plane, that's a/sqrt(3) ≈5.77 Angstroms. But in our case, it's a rhombohedral system with angles of 30 degrees, so the interplanar distance should be longer than the cubic case because the angles are smaller, right? Because a smaller angle would mean the planes are further apart.

Wait, but 5.77 is smaller than the options given. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, another thought: in a rhombohedral system, the relation between the interplanar distance and the Miller indices might be different. Maybe the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) (1 - cosθ) ) )

Wait, let's compute that for (111), θ=30°, a=10.

h=k=l=1.

Compute denominator:

h² +k² +l² =3.

Then, 2*(hk + hl + kl) = 2*(3)=6.

(1 - cosθ)=1 - (√3/2) ≈0.13397.

So 6 *0.13397 ≈0.8038.

So denominator is sqrt(3 +0.8038) = sqrt(3.8038) ≈1.95.

So d=10/1.95≈5.128. Still way below the options.

Hmm, I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about the options. The options are: A)9.08, B)8.95, C)9.54, D)10.05.

Possible approach: perhaps the formula for d is a / (sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) ), but that would be the cubic case. For (111), that gives 10 / sqrt(3) ≈5.77 Angstroms. Not matching. But the options are all larger than 8.9.

Alternative idea: Perhaps the given angles are 30 degrees, but the formula uses the supplementary angle? Because sometimes in crystallography, the angle between vectors is 180-30=150°, because the vectors could be pointing inward.

Wait, that's a possibility. Because in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the lattice vectors a, b, c are given as 30 degrees, but perhaps in the formula, it's the angle between the vectors when looking at the unit cell, which could be 180-30=150 degrees. Because in a rhombohedral structure, the angle is the angle between the edges of the unit cell, which can be 30, but perhaps the formula uses the angle between the vectors as 150°, not 30°. Because the vectors are arranged in a way that the angle between them is the acute or obtuse angle.

Wait, that might be the case. Because in a rhombohedral structure, the vectors a, b, c are all equal, but the angle between any two vectors is 30 degrees, which is acute. But in some conventions, the angle used in the formula is the obtuse angle, 180-30=150°, which would make cosθ = cos(150°)= -√3/2 ≈-0.866.

Ah, that might make a big difference. Let me try that.

So, if θ is 150°, then cosθ= -√3/2 ≈-0.866.

Let me recompute using θ=150°, cosθ=-0.866.

So for (111), h=k=l=1.

Using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk cosθ + hl cosθ + kl cosθ) )

So denominator inside sqrt:

3 - 2*(1*1*(-0.866) + 1*1*(-0.866) + 1*1*(-0.866)).

Each term is -0.866. So 3 -2*(3*(-0.866))=3 -2*(-2.598) =3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863.

d=10 /2.863≈3.49 Angstroms. Still not matching options.

Wait, but that's even smaller. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the formula with the correct sign. Because if θ is the angle between the vectors, then if the angle is 30°, the formula uses cos30, but if the angle is 150°, the formula uses cos150= -cos30.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula uses the angle between the vectors as 60°, but that's another possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation for a rhombohedral system where the angles are 30°, but the formula uses the angle between the reciprocal vectors. Hmm, this is getting too complicated.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = a / (sqrt( h² +k² +l² ) ) * (1/(sqrt(1 - cosθ))) )

But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the reciprocal lattice. In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) [1, 0, 0]

b2 = (2π/a) [0, 1, 0]

b3 = (2π/a) [0, 0, 1]

But wait, that's for a cubic system. For a rhombohedral, it's more complex. But perhaps in this case, it's better to think of the reciprocal vectors as:

b1 = (2π/a) (1, 0, 0 )

b2 = (2π/a) (0, 1, 0 )

b3 = (2π/a) (0, 0, 1 )

But that can't be correct because the angles are not 90 degrees.

Wait, perhaps I should use the metric tensor approach. The metric tensor g for a rhombohedral system is:

g = a² [ 1          cosθ      cosθ

          cosθ       1         cosθ

          cosθ      cosθ       1 ]

So, for any vector v = (h, k, l), the reciprocal lattice vector is given by solving g v = (1/d²) I, where d is the interplanar distance.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for d comes from the inverse of the metric tensor.

The reciprocal of the metric tensor G is:

G^(-1) = (1/a²) [ 1/c11   -c12/c11    -c13/c11

                -c21/c11  1/c22      -c32/c22

                -c31/c11  -c32/c22    1/c33 ]

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, the interplanar distance d is given by 1/(sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )) * (1/a) )

Wait, but that's similar to what I did before. So, perhaps I'm stuck.

Given that, perhaps I should look for the correct formula for a rhombohedral system. After some quick thinking, I recall that the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl)(1 - cosθ) } }

Wait, let me try this formula again with θ=30°.

So for (111), h=k=l=1.

Denominator inside sqrt:

3 + 2*(3)*(1 - cos30) =3 + 6*(1 - 0.866) =3 +6*(0.134)=3+0.804=3.804.

So sqrt(3.804)= approx 1.95.

So d=10/1.95≈5.128. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another possible formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl)(1 - cosθ) } }

Wait, let's compute that.

Denominator inside sqrt: 3 - 2*(3)*(1 - 0.866) =3 - 2*3*(0.134)=3 -0.804=2.196.

sqrt(2.196)= approx 1.482.

So d=10/1.482≈6.74 Angstroms. Still not near the options.

Hmm, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) (1 + cosθ) } }

Wait, let's try that. For (111), θ=30°, cosθ=0.866.

Denominator: 3 + 2*(3)*(1+0.866) =3 +6*(1.866)=3 +11.196=14.196.

sqrt(14.196)= approx 3.77.

So d=10/3.77≈2.65 Angstroms. No, that's way too small.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the interplanar distance as a function of the unit cell parameters. For a rhombohedral system, the unit cell volume V= a³ sqrt(1-3 cosθ + (3/2) cos²θ )

But I'm not sure how that helps with the interplanar distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the (111) plane's interplanar distance is given by a/(sqrt(3 - 6 cosθ + 6 cos²θ)).

Wait, let me compute that. For θ=30°, cosθ=0.866.

So denominator inside sqrt: 3 -6*(0.866) +6*(0.866)^2.

Compute each term:

3 is 3.

6*0.866=5.196.

6*(0.75)=4.5, since 0.866² is 0.75.

So 3 -5.196 +4.5= 3 -5.196= -2.196 +4.5=2.304.

sqrt(2.304)=1.518.

d=10 /1.518≈6.59 Angstroms. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the given angles are 30°, but the formula uses the angle between the reciprocal vectors. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this and the correct answer is option C) 9.54 Angstroms, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl)(1 - cosθ) )

Wait, that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this correctly again.

With a=10, θ=30°, h=k=l=1.

Denominator: 3 + 6*(1 - 0.866) =3 +6*(0.134)=3 +0.804=3.804.

sqrt(3.804)=1.95.

d=10/1.95≈5.128 Angstroms.

But the options are much larger. So maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But with θ=60°, because in some conventions, the angle used is the supplement.

Wait, let's try θ=60°, cosθ=0.5.

Denominator:3 -2*(3)*0.5 =3-3=0. So d would be infinite, which is impossible. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps θ=120°, cosθ=-0.5.

Denominator:3 -2*(3)*(-0.5)=3 +3=6.

sqrt(6)=2.449.

d=10/2.449≈4.08 Angstroms.

Nope.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let's think of alternative ways. Perhaps the given interatomic distance is not a, but the interplanar distance for (100) plane, which in a cubic system would be a, but maybe in rhombohedral it's different. Wait, but the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. So a=10.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is correct but I'm miscalculating the denominator.

Wait, let me recompute the denominator for θ=30°, using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2(hk cosθ + hl cosθ + kl cosθ) )

So for (111), denominator inside sqrt is:

3 - 2*( 3 * cos30 )

Which is 3 -6*(0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196.

But that's negative, which is impossible. So perhaps the formula is with a plus sign:

d = a / sqrt( 3 + 6 cos30 )

Which would be 3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstroms.

Still not matching options.

Wait, perhaps I should stop trying to find a formula and think about this differently. Maybe the interplanar distance is larger because the angles are small. So, perhaps the interplanar distance formula for (111) is a/sqrt(3) ≈5.77, but with the angles causing it to be larger.

Wait, but the options are all around 9. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is given by a/sqrt(3 - 6 cosθ), but with θ=30°.

Wait, let's compute that:

3 -6*(0.866) =3-5.196= -2.196. So sqrt is imaginary, so no.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is a/sqrt(3 +6 cosθ).

3 +6*(0.866)=3+5.196=8.196. So sqrt is ~2.863. d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstroms.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is a multiplied by some factor. But I can't see where.

Wait, another approach: consider that in a rhombohedral system, the (111) plane is equivalent to a hexagonal close-packed plane, and perhaps the interplanar distance is larger. But I can't directly apply that.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct formula. I think I'm taking too long, so perhaps I should proceed with what I have.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the interplanar distance is given by d = a / (sqrt(1 + 2 cosθ)).

Wait, for θ=30°, cosθ=0.866.

So denominator is sqrt(1 + 2*0.866)=sqrt(2.732)=1.652.

d=10 /1.652≈6.055 Ang. Still doesn't match options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral system, the (111) planes correspond to a certain spacing. But without the correct formula, I'm stuck.

An alternative approach: perhaps the given angles are 30°, but the formula uses 60°, so let's compute:

cos60=0.5.

Using the formula:

d = a / sqrt(3 -6*(0.5) )= a/sqrt(0)=inf. No.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is a multiplied by sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) / (some function of the angles), but I can't figure that out.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct formula in a textbook. Wait, in Ashcroft-Mermin, the interplanar distance for a general cubic system is given by a/sqrt( h² +k² +l² ), but for non-cubic systems, it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct formula is d = a / (sqrt(3)), which gives approx 5.77, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer isn't any of the options, but that can't be as the question must have a correct option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. Another formula I found earlier is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\alpha) } } * (a^2/(a^2))^{1/2} }

But that doesn't change anything.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the angles given are the angles between the planes, not the angles between the vectors. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which for (111), θ=30°, gives denominator sqrt(3 -6*(0.866))=sqrt(-2.196), impossible.

Hmm. Given that, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the formula as:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) (1 - cosθ) )

Which for (111) and θ=30°, denominator sqrt(3.804)=1.95, d=5.128 Angstroms.

But this doesn't match any options. Since all the options are around 9, perhaps I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, wait. Maybe I'm confusing the interatomic distance with another parameter. The interatomic distance is the distance between atoms in the lattice. In a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance (the edge length a) is given as 10 Angstroms. So a=10.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal using the formula correctly.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk cosγ + hl cosβ + kl cosα) ) ) * (a / [abc]^{1/2}) )

But considering a rhombohedral system, a=b=c, and the angles are all θ=30°, so:

abc = a^3.

And the volume V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cosθ + 3 cos²θ/2 ) )

Wait, the formula for the volume of a rhombohedral unit cell is V = a³ * sqrt(1 - 3 cosθ + (3/2) cos²θ) )

But I'm not sure how this ties into the interplanar distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for d_{hkl} is (a^2/(h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl)(1 - cosθ)))^{1/2}.

Wait, let me compute that.

For (111), a=10, theta=30°.

Compute denominator inside sqrt: 3 + 6*(1 - 0.866)=3 +6*(0.134)=3 +0.804=3.804.

So sqrt(3.804)=1.95.

So d = (10^2 / 3.804 )^{1/2} = (100 /3.804 )^{1/2} = (26.29)^{1/2}≈5.128 Angstroms.

Again, same result.

Hmm. I'm not getting anywhere with this. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Wait, one more idea: perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is different and the correct approach is to compute it as:

d_{hkl} = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which would be a multiplied by sqrt(3) / sqrt(3 -6 cosθ).

Wait, for (111):

sqrt(3) is 1.732.

Denominator is sqrt(3 -6*(0.866))=sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible.

So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the interplanar distance for (111) is a multiplied by the reciprocal of the square root of  some positive number.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct formula is:

d = (a^2/(h^2 +k^2 +l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl)(1 - cosθ)))^{1/2}

Which for (111) would be:

a^2=100.

Denominator:3 +6*(1 -0.866)=3 +0.804=3.804.

So d= sqrt(100/3.804)=sqrt(26.29)=5.128.

Same as before.

Hmm. So I think I'm stuck. Given the options, the closest I can get is 5.128, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal of the volume. The volume V of the unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1-3 cosθ + 3 cos²θ/2) )

So for θ=30°, V=10^3 * sqrt(1 -3*(0.866) + 3*(0.75)/2 )

Compute inside sqrt:

1 -2.598 + (2.25)/2 → 1-2.598= -1.598 +1.125= -0.473.

sqrt(-0.473) is imaginary. No, that can't be right. So perhaps V is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cosθ + 3/2 cos²θ )

Wait, for θ=30°, cosθ=0.866.

Compute 1 -3*(0.866) + (3/2)*(0.75) → 1-2.598 +1.125= (1+1.125)-2.598=2.125-2.598= -0.473. Again, negative.

That's impossible. So perhaps the formula is different. Maybe V = a^3 * sqrt(1 + 3 cosθ + 3/2 cos²θ )

Wait, compute that:

1 +3*(0.866)=1+2.598=3.598.

3/2 * 0.75=1.125.

So 3.598 +1.125=4.723.

sqrt(4.723)= 2.173.

So V=1000 *2.173=2173 Angstrom^3.

But I'm not sure how that helps with the interplanar distance.

Another approach: perhaps I should use the Bragg's law equation, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C)9.54 Angstroms, but I don't know how to get there.

Wait, maybe I should try the formula with θ=60°, but that would require cosθ=0.5.

Wait, for θ=60°, denominator inside sqrt:3 -6*(0.5)=3-3=0. So d would be infinite. No.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses 2θ instead of θ.

Wait, if θ=30°, then 2θ=60°, cos60=0.5.

Then denominator:3 -6*(0.5)=0. So d is infinite. No.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl)(1 - cosθ) )

Which gives 10/sqrt(3.804)=5.128 Angstroms. But not matching options.

Given that I can't find a way to get any of the options, perhaps I should re-examine the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C)9.54 Angstroms. Let me think: 10 divided by approximately 1.05 would be 9.52, which is close to option C.

But why would the denominator be 1.05?

Wait, maybe if the denominator inside the sqrt is approximately (3 +6*(1 - 0.866))=3+0.804=3.804. sqrt(3.804) is about 1.95, but if I made a mistake and the formula is different, perhaps the denominator is sqrt( (3) )=1.732. 10/1.732≈5.77 Angstroms.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply by sqrt(3) instead of dividing. 10*sqrt(3)=17.32, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal of the denominator. So 1.95 would give d=5.128. But given that, none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / (sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) (1 - cosθ) )) )

Which would give denominator sqrt(3 -6*(1 -0.866))=sqrt(3 -6*0.134)=sqrt(3 -0.804)=sqrt(2.196)=1.482.

d=10/1.482≈6.74 Angstroms. Still not matching options.

At this point, I think I'm stuck and perhaps the correct answer is option C)9.54 Angstroms. But I can't see how to get there. Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate the approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) )

But with theta=30°, cos30=0.866.

Denominator:3 - 2*(3)*0.866=3-5.196=-2.196. Impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is the same but with theta=60°, but that gives 3-3=0, again impossible.

Hmm.

After trying all possible angles and formulas and not finding a match, perhaps the correct answer is option A)9.08 Angstroms.

Wait, 10 divided by approx 1.10 is 9.09. So perhaps the denominator is about 1.10.

So how to get 1.10 from the formula.

If the denominator inside sqrt is (3 + 2*(3)*(1 - cosθ))=3 +6*(1 - cosθ).

If this is equal to (1.10)^2=1.21, then 3 +6*(1 - cosθ)=1.21 → 6*(1 - cosθ)= -1.79 → cosθ= 1 + (1.79/6)=1 +0.298=1.298. Which is impossible, since cosθ can't exceed 1.

So that doesn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (3 -6 cosθ) equals 100/(d^2), so 3 -6 cosθ= (100/d^2).

If d=9.54, then 100/(9.54)^2≈100/91≈1.098.

So 3 -6 cosθ=1.098 → 6 cosθ=3 -1.098=1.902 → cosθ=0.317. So θ≈71.5 degrees. But in the question, theta is 30 degrees.

Thus, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just give up and choose the option closest to 10, which would be D)10.05, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the formula. Let me consider the simple cubic case. For (111), d= a/sqrt(3)=10/1.732≈5.77 Angstroms.

But the options are much larger. So perhaps the correct formula is different.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl)(1 - cosθ) )

Which for (111), gives 10/sqrt(3.804)=5.128, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * (h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl)(1 - cosθ) )^(-1/2)

Which is what I've been using.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all options, and perhaps the correct answer isn't matching any of my calculations. But since I have to choose, perhaps the intended answer is option C)9.54 Angstroms.

Wait, wait. Let me compute 10 divided by approximately 1.05: 10/1.05≈9.523, which is close to option C)9.54.

So perhaps the denominator is approximately 1.05.

How to get 1.05 from the formula.

Denominator: sqrt(3 +6*(1 - cosθ))=1.05 → 3 +6*(1 - cosθ)=1.1025 → 6*(1 - cosθ)= -1.8975 → cosθ=1 + (1.8975/6)=1.31625. Impossible.

So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe it's d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / (something).

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / (some function of angles).

But without knowing, I can't proceed.

Given that, I'll have to make a guess based on the options. The only option that is close to the cubic case multiplied by a factor of sqrt(3)/something is option C)9.54, which is approximately 10 * (3/3.16)=9.49, but I have no idea.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) (1 - cosθ) )

Which would be 3 -6*(1 -0.866)=3 -6*(0.134)=3-0.804=2.196.

sqrt(2.196)=1.482.

d=10/1.482≈6.74 Ang. Not matching.

I think I've tried everything and can't find a way to get an option. Perhaps the correct answer is A)9.08, but I'm not sure how.

Wait, maybe I should compute using θ=60°, but that gives impossible results. Hmm.

After all this, I think I'll have to concede that I can't find the correct approach, but based on the options, the answer must be option C)9.54 Angstroms.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d_{hkl} \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is used:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl)(1 - \cos\theta)}}
\]

For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \), and \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \). Substituting these values:

1. Compute the terms:
   - \( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3 \),
   - \( 2(hk + hl + kl) = 2(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1) = 6 \),
   - \( 1 - \cos 30^\circ = 1 - 0.866 = 0.134 \).

2. Substitute into the formula:
   \[
   d_{111} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3 + 6 \cdot 0.134}}
   \]

3. Simplify the denominator:
   \[
   3 + 6 \cdot 0.134 = 3 + 0.804 = 3.804
   \]

4. Compute the square root:
   \[
   \sqrt{3.804} \approx 1.95
   \]

5. Final calculation:
   \[
   d_{111} = \frac{10}{1.95} \approx 5.128 \, \text{Å}
   \]

This result, approximately \( 5.128 \, \text{Å} \), does not match any of the provided options. After extensive consideration of alternative formulas and approaches, none yield a result consistent with the given options. The options provided are significantly larger, suggesting a possible misunderstanding of the formula or the given parameters. Based on the options, the closest plausible answer is **C) 9.54 Å**, though the reasoning to reach this value remains unclear.

Answer: C
