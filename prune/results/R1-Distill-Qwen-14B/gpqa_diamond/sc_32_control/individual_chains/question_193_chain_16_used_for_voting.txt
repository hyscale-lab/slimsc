Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, parallax is a measure of distance, right? I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So, the bigger the parallax, the closer the star is, because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Wait, the formula given is like N ∝ 1/plx^5. So N is the number of stars, and it's inversely proportional to parallax to the fifth power. But since parallax and distance are inversely related, maybe I can express N in terms of distance instead.

Let me recall the formula for parallax. Parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by distance (in parsecs). So, plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx. So, if I want to express N in terms of d, I can substitute plx with 1/d.

So, N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's work that out. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5. So 1 divided by that is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So, it's about the number of stars in a thin shell at a distance r, maybe?

I think the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume. But in this case, it's given as a specific relation to parallax. So if N varies as 1/plx^5, which I've translated to N ∝ d^5.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. Let me see:

Given N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, replacing that gives N ∝ d^5.

So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. But the options don't have a fifth power directly. Wait, looking at the options:

Options are A) r^3, B) r^5, C) r^4, D) r^2.

So option B is r^5. So the number of stars increases as the distance to the fifth power. But wait, that seems a lot. Usually, the number of stars you can observe in a given volume depends on the volume. Volume goes as r^3. But here, it's given a different relationship.

Wait, maybe I should think about surface area. Because the number of stars you can observe in a thin shell (per unit distance) would be proportional to the area of the shell. The area is 4πr². But that's for a spherical shell. But the question says "per unit range of distance, r", so maybe it's the number per unit volume. No, wait, the question says how does the number of stars change with distance per unit range, so I think it's the number of stars in a thin shell of thickness dr, so that's proportional to the surface area times dr.

Wait, but the parallax relation might not depend on the actual volume distribution of stars. The question says in a specific region, so perhaps the number of stars observed at a distance r is given by this 1/plx^5 relation.

Alternatively, maybe the confusion is about whether the number of stars per unit distance is N ∝ d^5, which would mean that for each small increase in distance, the number of stars increases by that factor. But that would mean that as you go further, each small step adds a lot more stars, which might not make sense because the actual number of stars in the universe doesn't just keep increasing like that, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the differential number of stars with respect to distance. So, N is the number of stars in a small range of distance dr around r. So, dN/dr would be the number per unit distance. If N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr is 5d^4. But wait, the question says the number varies with plx as 1/plx^5, which is d^5. So the question is, per unit range of distance, how does the number change. So that's the derivative, perhaps?

Wait, the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So, per unit distance interval, how does N change.

If N increases as r^5, then the change in N per unit r would be 5r^4, which is option C, but that's not one of the options. Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C is r^4. So if the number of stars per unit distance goes as r^4, maybe that's the case? Or perhaps I'm mixing up the approach.

Alternatively, maybe the initial approach is correct. Since N ∝ 1/plx^5 = d^5, then the number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance. So, per unit distance, the number of stars increases as r^5. But the options have an option for r^5, which is option B.

Wait, but if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars in a region at distance d is proportional to d^5. So when d increases, N increases a lot. So for each increment in d, the number of stars increases by a factor of (d+dr)^5 - d^5, which approximately is 5d^4 dr for small dr. So the change in N per unit distance is about 5d^4, which is proportional to d^4.

But the question says 'how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)'. So if I think of it as dN/dr = 5d^4, then the change is proportional to r^4. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but the initial statement was that N varies with 1/plx^5, which is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So in a small volume shell, the number of stars is proportional to d^5 per unit volume? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the initial approach is correct, and the change in N with r is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars increases as r^5. So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but let me think again. The initial number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. So N ∝ d^5. So for each distance d, the number of stars is proportional to d^5. So as d increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So, if you have a region that's a thin shell at distance r, the number of stars in that shell (dN) would be proportional to 4π r² dr multiplied by some density. But in this problem, the relation is given as N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is d^5. So perhaps the number of stars in a shell is proportional to d^5. But that doesn't make much sense because a shell's volume is 4π r² dr, which is proportional to r² times dr. Unless the star density itself is increasing with distance. But in this problem, the relation given is N ∝ 1/plx^5, so N is proportional to d^5. So in that case, the number of stars in a shell would be proportional to d^5 times something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the volume but just a direct count. That is, the number of stars you can count in a region is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, which is d^5. So if I have a region at distance d, the number of stars is d^5. Then, as I move to a distance d + dr, the number of stars would be (d + dr)^5. The change (dN) would be approximately 5d^4 dr.

Wait, so dN/dr is approximately 5d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) is proportional to d^4. So the change in the number of stars per unit distance increases as d^4, which is option C.

But wait, the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So does "change" refer to the derivative, i.e., the rate of change? If so, then the rate is 5d^4, which is proportional to r^4. So answer C.

But earlier, I thought that N is proportional to d^5, and in that case, the answer would be B. But if the question is about how the number changes with distance, which is the derivative, then the answer would be C.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me re-express the problem.

The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is a constant.

But plx = 1/d, so N = k * d^5.

So N = k d^5.

The question is, how does the number change with distance per unit range. So, for a small change in d (delta d), what's the change in N (delta N) ?

delta N ≈ (dN/dr) * delta d.

So dN/dr = dN/dd = 5k d^4.

So delta N ≈ 5k d^4 delta d.

So the number of stars per unit distance (delta d) is proportional to d^4.

So the correct answer would be option C, which is ~ r^4.

Wait, but the options are given in terms of r, not d. So r is distance, so same as d.

So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit torn because the initial relation N varies as d^5. So the number increases rapidly with distance. But the question is about how the number changes per unit distance. So the change is dN/dr =5d^4. So ~ r^4.

So the correct option is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) as \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \). Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance (\( \text{plx} = 1/d \)), substituting \( \text{plx} = 1/d \) into the relation gives \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). To determine this, we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which represents the rate of change of the number of stars per unit distance. Starting with \( N \propto d^5 \), the derivative is:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5d^4.
\]

This shows that the change in the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
