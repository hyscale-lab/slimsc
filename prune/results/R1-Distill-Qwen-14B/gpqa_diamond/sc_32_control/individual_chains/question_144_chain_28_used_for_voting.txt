Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that X is a meson resonance with production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. We need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A to D, with various distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance (or mean proper decay length) is related to the particle's lifetime and velocity. So the formula must involve the lifetime, speed, and probably factors like Planck's constant or something like that.

First, I think about the relation between the width Γ and the lifetime τ. Oh right, the uncertainty principle says Γ is inversely proportional to τ. The formula is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, no, I think it's Γ ≈ ħ / τ. So τ is the lifetime of the particle.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get that right. The width Γ is the energy width corresponding to the particle's lifetime uncertainty. The uncertainty principle is ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2, right? So Γ is roughly the uncertainty in energy, ΔE, and the uncertainty in time is the lifetime τ. So, Γ τ ≈ ħ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Yeah, that makes sense.

Next, I need to find the velocity of the particle. Because the decay distance is velocity multiplied by the lifetime. So the mean decay length L is v * τ.

But wait, the particle has a certain energy E, so I can find its velocity from that. The energy E is the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. So γ = E/(m c²).

But wait, units here might get tricky. Let me think about units. E is given in GeV, m in GeV/c². So E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV/c². Let me compute γ first.

γ = E / (m c²) → But wait, m c² is in GeV already, since m is in GeV/c² and c² has units (m²/s²). So when I compute m c², the units would be GeV. So 8 GeV divided by 1.2 GeV gives γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So approximately 6.6667.

Then, the velocity v can be found from β = v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Let me compute that.

Wait, β = sqrt(1 - (m c² / E)^2) → since E = γ m c², so (m c² / E) = 1/γ. So β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ)^2).

So γ is 8/1.2 → 8 ÷ 1.2 is 6.666..., so 1/γ is 0.15. So 1/γ squared is 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is about 0.9887, so β ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887c.

But wait, maybe I should compute it more precisely. Let me do that.

γ = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666...

So γ = 6.666666... So 1/γ is 0.15.

So β = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775). Let me compute that. Hmm, sqrt(0.9775). I know that sqrt(0.9801) is 0.99, since 0.99^2 is 0.9801. 0.9775 is a bit less, so maybe around 0.9887. Wait, let me compute 0.9887^2: 0.9887 * 0.9887. Let's see, 0.98^2 is 0.9604. The exact value is a bit tricky, but perhaps I can use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using a binomial approximation. Let's see, 0.9775 is 1 - 0.0225. So sqrt(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2 when x is small. So x is 0.0225, so sqrt ≈ 1 - 0.01125 = 0.98875. So yeah, that's about 0.98875c. So β is approximately 0.98875.

Now, the lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is given in MeV. ħ has units of GeV·s. Let me check the units properly.

Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because ħ = h/(2π), and h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. But converting J to GeV: 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, which is 1e9 * 1.602e-19 J = 1.602e-10 J. So ħ in J·s is 6.626e-34/(2π) ≈ 1.054e-33 J·s. To convert to GeV·s, divide by 1.602e-10 J/GeV. So 1.054e-33 / 1.602e-10 ≈ 6.58e-25 GeV·s. So about 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

But Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.

6.582 / 0.32 → Let's compute that. 0.32 *20.56 is 6.58. So approximately 20.566... So τ ≈ 20.566e-25 s. Wait, that would be 2.0566e-24 seconds? Wait no, because 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 → 20.56875 * 1e-25 → 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.

6.582 ÷ 0.32: 0.32 × 20 =6.4 → 6.582 → 6.4=20 × 0.32, 0.182 left. 0.182 / 0.32 ≈ 0.56875. So 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, but that seems really small. I thought the mean lifetime for such particles is on the order of 1e-24 seconds or so. That's ok.

Now, the next step is to compute the decay distance L = v * τ. But v is in terms of c, which is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So v = β c = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ (0.98875)*3e8 ≈ 2.96625e8 m/s.

Wait, but maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute 0.98875 *3e8:

0.98875 * 3 = 2.96625, so 2.96625e8 m/s.

So L = v * τ = (2.96625e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) → Let's compute that.

Multiply 2.96625e8 by 2.056875e-24:

First, 2.96625 * 2.056875 ≈ ?

Hmm, 3 * 2 is 6, so let me compute:

2.96625 * 2.056875.

Let me approximate:

= (3 - 0.03375) * (2 + 0.056875)
= 3*2 + 3*0.056875 - 0.03375*2 - 0.03375 *0.056875
= 6 + 0.170625 - 0.0675 - 0.001903
= 6 + (0.170625 - 0.0675) - 0.001903
= 6 + 0.103125 -0.001903
= 6.101222

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, compute 2.96625 × 2.056875:

Let me compute 2.96625 × 2 = 5.9325.

2.96625 × 0.05 = 0.1483125.

2.96625 × 0.006875 = ?

0.006875 is 22.5/1000 (since 0.00625 is 1/160, but perhaps I'll compute directly).

0.006875 = 6.875e-3.

So 2.96625 × 0.006875 = 0.0204453125.

So total is 5.9325 + 0.1483125 = 6.0808125, plus 0.0204453125 → 6.1012578125.

So 2.96625e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.1012578125e-16 m.

Wait, because 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16. So 6.1012578e-16 meters.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.0223e-16, and option C is 5.0223e-15. So my result is about 6e-16, which doesn't match any of the options. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let's double-check the calculation steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing τ. Because when I compute τ, Γ is given in MeV, but I used it in GeV. Oh wait, Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So that part is correct.

Wait, let me recompute τ.

Γ = 0.32 GeV.

ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So τ = ħ / Γ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let me compute 6.582 ÷ 0.32.

0.32 × 20 = 6.4 → 6.582 is 6.4 + 0.182.

So 6.582 ÷ 0.32 = 20 + (0.182 / 0.32) = 20 + 0.56875 = 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. That's correct.

Now, v = β c. β is 0.98875, so v ≈ 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s = 2.96625e8 m/s.

Then, L = v * τ = (2.96625e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = 2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Wait, 2.96625e8 = 2.96625 × 1e8.

2.056875e-24 = 2.056875 × 1e-24.

Multiply them together: 2.96625 * 2.056875 = as before, about 6.101.

Exponents: 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.

So 6.101 × 1e-16 m → 6.101e-16 m. But none of the options have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the velocity in a different way. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used relativistic expressions more accurately. Let's see.

The mean decay length L is also given by (c * τ) * β γ. Wait, because L = v * τ = β c * τ = β c * (ħ / Γ).

Wait, another approach: the mean path is c * τ * β γ? Or is it β γ c τ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me get back to the formula.

The lifetime τ is the proper time, the time measured in the rest frame of the particle. So when the particle is moving, the observed lifetime is γ τ. But the decay length is the velocity times the observed lifetime, which is γ τ. Wait, no, because the velocity is in the lab frame.

Wait, the decay happens in the lab frame, so the lifetime observed is longer due to time dilation. So the lifetime in the lab frame is γ τ. So the distance is v * (γ τ).

Hmm, that makes sense because from the lab perspective, the particle moves at velocity v for a longer time.

Wait, but earlier I thought L = v * τ, but perhaps that's incorrect because τ is the proper lifetime. So the correct formula is L = v * (γ τ).

Wait, that's a big mistake if I made it. Let me clarify.

The proper lifetime is τ. In the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by a factor of γ. So the observed lifetime is t = γ τ. So the distance L is v * t = v γ τ.

Ah, so I should have calculated L as v * γ τ.

So let's recalculate:

β = v/c = 0.98875.

γ = 6.666666...

So L = v * γ τ = β c * γ τ.

Which is β * c * τ * γ.

But wait, τ is in the rest frame, so when you're moving, the lifetime is longer by γ. So the correct expression is L = v * (γ τ).

So let's compute that.

So let me compute L = β c * γ τ.

Wait, but β is v/c, so v = β c.

So L = β c * γ τ = β γ c τ.

Wait, but earlier I computed τ as ħ / Γ.

So let me compute L = β * gamma * c * tau.

Tau is ħ / Γ.

So let me recompute.

Compute each part:

beta = 0.98875

gamma = 6.666666...

c = 3e8 m/s

tau = 2.056875e-24 s

So L = beta * gamma * c * tau.

Compute beta * gamma: 0.98875 * 6.666666... ≈ ?

0.98875 * 6 = 5.9325.

0.98875 * 0.666666 → 0.98875 * 2/3 ≈ 0.6591667.

So total is about 5.9325 + 0.6591667 = 6.5916667.

So beta * gamma ≈ 6.5916667.

Then, L = 6.5916667 * c * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16.

Multiply by 6.5916667:

6.170625e-16 * 6.5916667 ≈ ?

Let me compute 6.170625 * 6.5916667.

Approximating:

6 *6 =36.

6 * 0.5916667 ≈ 3.55.

0.170625 *6 ≈1.02375.

0.170625 *0.5916667≈ 0.1008.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 6.170625 *6.5916667.

Let me compute 6.170625 *6.5916667.

Hmm, perhaps I'll compute this as 6.170625 * (6 + 0.5 + 0.0916667).

=6.170625 *6 =37.02375,

6.170625 *0.5 =3.0853125,

6.170625 *0.0916667 ≈ 0.56540625.

Adding up: 37.02375 +3.0853125=40.1090625 +0.56540625=40.67446875.

So total is approximately 40.67446875e-16 m.

Wait, but wait, that's 40.674e-16 m, which is 4.0674e-15 meters.

Looking back at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m and option C is 5.0223e-15.

Hmm, wait, but earlier I thought the result after correction would be around 4e-15 m.

So let me check: 40.674e-16 m is 4.0674e-15 m. Which matches option B (4.0655e-15 m) very closely.

So why is this the case? Because I corrected the mistake of using τ instead of γτ for the lab frame lifetime.

So the correct decay length is approximately 4.067e-15 m, which is option B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me go through the steps again.

Compute beta = sqrt(1 - (1/γ)^2) → γ = 8/1.2 =6.666666667.

So 1/γ = 0.15, so (1/γ)^2 = 0.0225.

So beta = sqrt(1-0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

gamma is 6.666666667.

Then, tau = ħ / Γ =6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV → 6.582e-25 /0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

L = beta * gamma * c * tau.

beta * gamma = 0.9887 *6.666666667 ≈6.5917.

c * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.

Now, multiply by beta gamma: 6.5917 *6.170625e-16 = ?

6.5917 *6.170625 → Let me compute 6 *6 is 36, 6 * 0.170625=1.02375; 0.5917*6=3.5502; 0.5917*0.170625≈0.1009.

Wait, perhaps a better way: 6.5917 *6.170625.

Let me compute 6 *6 =36, 6 *0.170625=1.02375, 0.5917*6=3.5502, 0.5917 *0.170625≈0.1009.

Wait, perhaps a more precise method. Let me compute 6.5917 *6.170625.

Break it down:

= (6 + 0.5917) × (6 + 0.170625)
=6×6 +6×0.170625 +0.5917×6 +0.5917×0.170625

=36 + 1.02375 +3.5502 + (approx 0.1009)

=36 +1.02375=37.02375; +3.5502=40.57395; +0.1009=40.67485.

So 6.5917 ×6.170625 ≈40.67485 → 40.67485e-16 m =4.067485e-15 m.

Which rounds to about 4.0675e-15 m, which matches option B (4.0655e-15 m) closely, considering possible rounding in intermediate steps.

So the correct answer should be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the relation \( L = v \cdot \tau \), where \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle and \( v \) is its velocity. The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the width \( \Gamma \) by \( \tau = \hbar / \Gamma \), and the velocity \( v \) is derived from the relativistic relation \( \beta = v/c = \sqrt{1 - (1/\gamma)^2} \), where \( \gamma = E / (m c^2) \).

### Step 1: Compute \( \gamma \)
The energy \( E \) and mass \( m \) are given as \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Thus:
\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \beta \)
Using \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - (1/\gamma)^2} \):
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1}{6.6667}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \tau \)
The width \( \Gamma \) is given as \( 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Using \( \tau = \hbar / \Gamma \), where \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \):
\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( L \)
The mean decay distance \( L \) is given by \( L = v \cdot \tau \), where \( v = \beta c \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Substituting:
\[
v = \beta c = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \approx 2.96625 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]
\[
L = v \cdot \tau = (2.96625 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.0569 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 6.101 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Correct for relativistic time dilation
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is in the rest frame, but in the lab frame, the lifetime is extended by a factor \( \gamma \). Thus, the correct formula is:
\[
L = v \cdot (\gamma \tau)
\]
Substituting \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \):
\[
L = \beta \cdot \gamma \cdot c \cdot \tau
\]
\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.0569 \times 10^{-24})
\]
First, compute \( \beta \cdot \gamma \):
\[
\beta \cdot \gamma = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \approx 6.5917
\]
Then, compute \( c \cdot \tau \):
\[
c \cdot \tau = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.0569 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 6.1706 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]
Finally, compute \( L \):
\[
L = 6.5917 \cdot 6.1706 \times 10^{-16} \approx 4.0675 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0675 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which matches option **B**.

**Answer: B**
