Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a 2-dimensional metric because it's in terms of x and y, right? So the space described by this metric is 2D. But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface in 3D space, but maybe in this context, it's referring to a 2D surface in a higher-dimensional space. Hmm, not too sure, but let's proceed.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the metric represents a 2D surface embedded in a higher dimension. Because pseudospheres are usually considered in 3D, but maybe here it's a 2D surface. So, the area would be the area of this 2D surface, which is our metric.

The metric looks like it's conformally flat because it's a scalar multiple of the Euclidean metric (dx² + dy²). The conformal factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element in a conformally flat metric is usually computed as the determinant of the metric, which for 2D is g = (g11 g22 - g12²). Since it's diagonal here, g12 is zero, so g = g11 * g22. Each of these is 32/(4 - x² - y²), so the determinant g is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]².

Wait, but wait, no, no. Wait, the area element in 2D is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. For a metric ds² = E dx² + G dy², the determinant is EG - (F)^2, but F is zero here because there's no cross term. So the determinant is E * G. In our case, E = G = 32/(4 - x² - y²), so determinant g = [32/(4 - x² - y²)]².

Wait, but then the area would be the integral of sqrt(g) dx dy, but since it's already the determinant, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, which is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy. So the area is the integral of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy over the surface.

Wait, but what is the region over which we're integrating? The metric's denominator is 4 - x² - y². So the condition is 4 - x² - y² > 0 for the denominator to be positive. So x² + y² <4. So the domain is a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. So the area would be the double integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 -x² -y²)] dx dy.

Hmm, so to compute this, maybe it's easier to switch to polar coordinates. Let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then the integral becomes:

Integral from θ=0 to 2π, and r=0 to 2 of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Because dx dy becomes r dr dθ. So the integrand becomes [32/(4 - r²)] * r.

Let me compute this integral. Let's factor out the constants:

32 * ∫ (from 0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (from 0 to 2) [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

The θ integral is straightforward: ∫0 to 2π dθ = 2π.

So the area is 32 * 2π * ∫0 to 2 [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

Compute that integral. Let me make a substitution: Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r. So (-1/2) du = r dr.

Wait, so when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ r dr / u ] → ∫ (4 to 0) (r dr) / u.

But r dr = (-1/2) du. So substituting, it becomes ∫ (4 to 0) [ (-1/2) du ] / u = (-1/2) ∫4^0 (1/u) du.

Which is (-1/2) [ ln u ] from 4 to 0. Wait, but when u approaches 0, ln u approaches negative infinity. Hmm, that's a problem. Let's compute it:

∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr = ∫ (r dr) / (4 - r²) = - (1/2) ln|4 - r²| ) + C.

Wait, but evaluating from 0 to 2:

At r=2, 4 - r² = 0 → ln 0 is negative infinity. At r=0, it's ln 4.

So the integral from 0 to 2 is [ - (1/2) ln(0) ] - [ - (1/2) ln(4) ].

Wait, but ln(0) is negative infinity, so this integral is diverging. So the area is 32 * 2π * (infinite) → infinite.

Wait, so the area is infinite. But that's the whole point, right? Because as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, meaning the metric becomes singular. So the area near r=2 is blowing up, leading to an infinite area.

So the area of the pseudosphere is infinite. So looking at the options, option D says +infty. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but wait, the question says "pseudosphere of radius r=2". Wait, I'm a bit confused. A pseudosphere is a surface, but in our case, perhaps the metric is that of a pseudosphere. Wait, the metric given is similar to the metric of a sphere, but with a negative curvature?

Wait, no, wait, the metric for a sphere of radius a in 2D is ds² = (a²/(x² + y² + a²)) (dx² + dy²). Hmm, not exactly the same. Wait, our metric is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a metric with a denominator approaching zero when r approaches 2. So perhaps it's a hyperbolic metric, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the metric of a sphere with a singularity at r=2. So the area ends up being infinite because the metric has a point (r=2) where it becomes singular, making the total area diverge.

So the area is infinite, which would make the answer D) +infty.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2-dimensional space. The task is to compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\). To find the area, we calculate the area element in this space, which is proportional to the determinant of the metric tensor. For a conformally flat metric \(ds^2 = \frac{C}{D} (dx^2 + dy^2)\), the determinant of the metric is \(\left(\frac{C}{D}\right)^2\). Here, \(C = 32\) and \(D = 4 - x^2 - y^2\), so the determinant is 

\[
g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

The area element is then 

\[
dA = \sqrt{g} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The region of integration is determined by the condition \(4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0\), which corresponds to the domain \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), or a circle of radius 2 in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. Switching to polar coordinates (\(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\)), the area becomes 

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The \(\theta\)-integral contributes a factor of \(2\pi\), leaving 

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, use the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), which gives \(du = -2r \, dr\). The limits of integration change: when \(r = 0\), \(u = 4\), and when \(r = 2\), \(u = 0\). The integral becomes 

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -\frac{1}{2} \ln|u| \Big|_4^0.
\]

As \(u \to 0\), \(\ln|u| \to -\infty\), so the integral diverges. This indicates that the area near \(r = 2\) (where the metric becomes singular) is infinite. Therefore, the total area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

Given the options:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this does not represent the area of the pseudosphere.
- **C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this is not relevant to the area.
- **D) \(+\infty\)**: Correct, as the area diverges due to the singularity at \(r = 2\).

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.
