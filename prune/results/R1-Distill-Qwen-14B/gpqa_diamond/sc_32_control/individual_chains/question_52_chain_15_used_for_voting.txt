Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. 

The question is about a star with certain parameters and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. I remember that when stars have spots, it affects their overall brightness and temperature, but I'm not exactly sure how that ties into the energy levels of atoms in the photosphere.

So, the star's normal parameters are 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, dark spots are cooler regions, right? So the star's average temperature decreases when spots are present.

The problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes without spots compared to when it has spots.

I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the populations of two energy levels. The equation is something like n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this case, the problem states that the ratio observed (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So when spots are present, the ratio is lower. That would mean that when spots are present, n1 is less than n2 compared to when there are no spots? Or wait, the ratio is n1/n2, and this ratio goes down. So when spots are present, n1/n2 is lower. So n1 is smaller relative to n2 than before.

But wait, when temperature changes, how does the population ratio change? Let me think. The Boltzmann factor is exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is E2 - E1. If the transition corresponds to 1448 Å, which is in the near UV, I think that's about 85.5 eV (since 1240 eV·Å / 1448 ≈ 0.856 eV, wait wait no, wait... 1240 eV·Å is the conversion for visible light, but wait, 1448 Å is longer than 1000 Å (which is 0.1 microns, ultraviolet?), so 1448 Å is approximately 0.1448 microns, which is in the near UV. So the energy difference between the two levels should be E = hc/λ. Let me compute that.

h is Planck's constant, about 6.626e-34 J·s. c is 3e8 m/s. λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 m. So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) )= approximately 1.37e-18 J per photon. To convert that to eV, since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, E ≈ 1.37e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.55 eV. So ΔE is about 8.55 eV.

So the exponent in the Boltzmann factor is - (8.55 eV) / (k*T). 

But wait, k is Boltzmann's constant. Let me think, 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So (k*T) in eV is (T in K) * (k in eV/K). Wait, I think the value of k in eV/K is approximately 8.617e-5 eV/K. So k*T for a given temperature T is T * 8.617e-5 eV.

So, for T = 6000 K (no spots), k*T is 6000 * 8.617e-5 ≈ 0.517 eV.

So the exponent becomes -8.55 / 0.517 ≈ -16.53. So exp(-16.53) is a very small number, about 6.5e-8. But wait, the Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) multiplied by this exponential. So if g2/g1 is 1 (assuming same statistical weights, which the problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's given or assumed?), then n2/n1 = exp(-16.53) ≈ 6.5e-8. So the ratio n2/n1 is about 6.5e-8, which is a very small number, meaning most atoms are in the lower energy state.

When the star has spots, the effective temperature drops to 5500 K. So k*T = 5500 * 8.617e-5 ≈ 0.4739 eV.

So exponent becomes -8.55 / 0.4739 ≈ -18.05. So exp(-18.05) is about 1.4e-8. So n2/n1 would be 1.4e-8, which is smaller than before. Wait, but that's the ratio of n2 to n1. If the spots make the temperature lower, then the ratio n2/n1 goes down, which implies that the ratio n1/n2 increases. Because n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1). So when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases, so n1/n2 increases.

Wait, but the problem states that the observed ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. Huh? That contradicts what I just thought. Because according to my calculation, n1/n2 would increase when T decreases. So I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, let me double-check. The ratio of n1 to n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) ) ) * (1/ (exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) ))))? Wait, no, the Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(kT) ). So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So if the temperature decreases, ΔE/(kT) increases, so the exponent is more negative, making n2/n1 smaller. So n2 decreases relative to n1. So the ratio n1/n2 would be 1/(n2/n1), which would increase when T decreases.

But according to the problem statement, when the star has spots, the ratio of n1/n2 (Ti in level 1 vs level 2) decreases. That suggests that when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower. Which contradicts what I just found.

Wait a second, perhaps I got the energy levels mixed up. Maybe level 2 is higher energy than level 1. So when T decreases, the ratio n2/n1 (n2 being higher energy) decreases, which would mean that n1/n2 increases. But the problem states that n1/n2 decreases. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me read again. The ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots. So the ratio n1/n2 is decreasing. So when T is lower, n1 is lower than n2 relative to when T was higher. So when T decreases, n1/n2 decreases. But according to the Boltzmann equation, when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases, so n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) increases. That's a contradiction. So perhaps I got the energy levels reversed.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition is from level 1 to level 2, which would mean that level 2 is higher in energy than level 1. So ΔE is positive. So when the star has spots, the temperature is lower. So the exponent is more negative, so n2/n1 is lower, so n1/n2 is higher. But according to the problem, when spots are present, the ratio n1/n2 is lower. So that can't be. So perhaps I've got the energy levels the other way around.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the transition is from level 2 to level 1, which would mean that level 1 is higher in energy. No, because the transition corresponds to a photon being emitted when an atom drops from a higher to a lower energy level. So the photon's energy is E2 - E1, so E2 > E1. So level 2 is higher.

So why is the ratio n1/n2 decreasing when T drops? That would imply that n1 is getting smaller relative to n2 when T is lower. But according to the Boltzmann equation, when T is lower, n2/n1 decreases, so n1/n2 increases. So perhaps my initial reasoning is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the ionization state, but the problem says neutral atoms, so that shouldn't be the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the excitation, and the spots affect the line formation differently. Or maybe I got the formula backwards.

Wait, Boltzmann equation: n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

So in our case, considering n1 and n2, E2 > E1, so E_i is E2, n_i is n2, and E_j is E1, n_j is n1.

So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

If the temperature decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so n2/n1 decreases. So n2 is smaller relative to n1 when T is lower. So n1/n2 would be higher. Therefore, the ratio n1/n2 should increase when T decreases. But the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the observed ratio n1/n2 is lower. Hmm, that's a contradiction. So I must have some misunderstanding.

Wait, wait, perhaps the problem is looking at the ratio R = n2/n1, and the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, R decreases. So R is lower when T is lower. Which according to the equation, makes sense because R = n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So when T decreases, R decreases. So the ratio R is lower when T is lower. So the problem says that the ratio is observed to decrease when spots are present, which is consistent with R being n2/n1.

Wait, the problem says that the ratio of n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots. So if R is n2/n1, then when R decreases, n2/n1 decreases, so n1/n2 increases. So perhaps I'm getting confused about which ratio is being considered.

Wait the question is: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots." So the ratio is (n1 / n2) which is decreasing when the star has spots. So when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower. 

But according to the Boltzmann equation, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). So when T is lower, n2/n1 is smaller, meaning that n1/n2 is larger. But according to the problem, n1/n2 is smaller when T is lower. So perhaps the ratio is (n2/n1), and the problem statement is saying that it decreases when the star has spots, which would imply that when T is lower, R decreases.

So perhaps the question is inverting the ratio. Let me restate: the observed ratio that is decreasing is (n1/n2). So when spots are present, (n1/n2) is lower. So that would mean that n1 is smaller relative to n2 when T is lower. But according to the Boltzmann equation, if (n2/n1) = R, then when T is lower, R decreases, so (n1/n2) = 1/R increases. So this is a problem. 

This suggests that either I have a mistake in reasoning, or perhaps the problem is considering something else, like the Saha equation for ionization, but the problem says it's about neutral atoms, so that shouldn't be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (n2/n1), but the problem says the ratio (n1/n2) is decreasing. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's atmosphere is such that when spots are present, the temperature is lower, but the radiation field is also different because of the spots. Wait, but the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE. So I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the ratio n1/n2, but about the excitation temperature. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the problem regardless of this confusion. Let's try to find the factors.

The main idea is that the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in the two levels depends on the temperature. The problem is to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots (T = 6000 K) compared to when it has spots (T = 5500 K).

Assuming the ratio is n1/n2. According to the Boltzmann equation:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So the ratio when the star has no spots (T1=6000 K) is R1 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T1)).

When the star has spots (T2=5500 K), R2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T2)).

The factor by which the ratio changes is R1/R2 = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

So I can compute this factor.

Let me compute 1/T1 and 1/T2.

T1 = 6000 K → 1/T1 = 1/6000 ≈ 0.00016667 K^-1.

T2 =5500 K → 1/T2 ≈ 0.00018182 K^-1.

So (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (0.00016667 - 0.00018182) = -0.00001515 K^-1.

So ΔE/(k) is in units of eV/(eV/K) → K.

Wait, earlier I found that ΔE is 8.55 eV, and k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So ΔE/(k) = 8.55 / (8.617e-5) ≈ 99230 K.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

8.55 / 8.617e-5 = 8.55 / 0.00008617 ≈ 8.55 * (1/0.00008617) ≈ 8.55 * 11600 ≈ let's see: 8 * 11600 = 92,800. 0.55 *11600= 6380. So total is about 99,180 K.

So approximately 9.9e4 K.

So the exponent is (ΔE/(k)) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) = 9.9e4 K * (-0.00001515 K^-1) = 9.9e4 * (-1.515e-5) ≈ let's compute that.

9.9e4 = 99,000. 99,000 * 1.515e-5 = 99,000 * 0.00001515 = 1.500... approximately 1.49955.

But since it's multiplied by negative, the exponent is -1.49955.

So exp(-1.49955) ≈ e^-1.5 ≈ 0.2231.

So the factor R1/R2 is approximately 0.223.

But wait, this would imply that when T increases (from 5500 to 6000), R1 is higher than R2, which would mean that when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio n1/n2 is higher than when it has spots. So R1/R2 = 0.223 → R1 = 0.223 * R2. So the ratio when no spots is 0.223 times the ratio when there are spots. That would mean that the ratio without spots is lower, which contradicts our earlier conclusion.

Wait, no, because according to the problem, when spots are present, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So that would mean R2 < R1. But according to our calculation, R1 = 0.223 R2. So that would imply R1 < R2. Which is the opposite of what the problem says.

Hmm, this suggests that I'm making a mistake in the ratio. Maybe I should compute R2/R1 instead.

Wait, the question says: the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So R1 is the ratio when no spots, R2 when has spots. The factor is R1/R2.

But according to the calculation, R1/R2 is ~0.223. So the ratio when no spots is 0.223 times when has spots. So the ratio decreases when spots are present, which is what the problem says. So the factor is ~0.223, meaning the ratio without spots is about 0.223 times the ratio when spots are present. So the factor is 0.223, but that's not one of the options. The options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

Hmm, that's not matching. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe I got the exponents wrong. Let's recalculate.

Compute the exponent: (ΔE/(k)) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute (ΔE/(k T1)) - (ΔE/(k T2)) ), which is ΔE/(k) [ 1/T1 - 1/T2 ].

Wait, no, but when T increases, the exponent becomes larger, which makes the ratio R = n1/n2 = exp(ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the ratio n1/n2 when T is higher is higher, because higher T makes the exponent larger, so n1/n2 is higher.

Wait, let me recompute the exponents.

At T1=6000 K: exponent = ΔE/(k T1) = 8.55 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K) ) = 8.55 / (0.517) ≈ 16.53.

So exp(16.53) is about 1.9e7.

At T2=5500 K: exponent = 8.55 / (8.617e-5 *5500) ≈ 8.55 / (0.4739) ≈ 18.05. So exp(18.05) is about 1.2e8.

So R1 = (g1/g2) * 1.9e7.

R2 = (g1/g2) * 1.2e8.

Thus, R1/R2 = (1.9e7) / (1.2e8) ) ≈ 0.158. So about 0.158, which is approximately 1/6.33. So the ratio when no spots is about 0.158 times the ratio when spots are present. So the ratio decreases when spots are present, which aligns with the problem statement.

But the problem is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So factor = R1/R2 ≈ 0.158.

But looking at the options, none of them are around 0.158. The options are all greater than 1. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I inverted the ratio. The problem says that the ratio of n1/n2 decreases when the spots are present. That would mean that when spots are present (lower T), n1/n2 is lower. So R2 = n1/n2 at T2 < R1 at T1.

So R1/R2 is greater than 1. Because R1 is higher than R2.

Wait, but according to the exponents, R1 is lower than R2? Because when T is higher, the exponent is smaller (Wait, no, when T is higher, 1/T is smaller, so for the term (1/T1 - 1/T2), since T2 < T1, 1/T2 > 1/T1, so (1/T1 - 1/T2) is negative. So the exponent becomes negative, leading R1/R2 = exp(negative) <1.

Wait, perhaps I should compute R2/R1 instead. Because the problem is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots (R1) compared to when it has spots (R2). So the factor is R1/R2.

Wait, in our earlier calculation, R1/R2 was 0.158. So the ratio when no spots is about 0.158 times the ratio when there are spots. So the ratio without spots is smaller, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says that when spots are present, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So when no spots, the ratio is higher; when spots, it's lower. So R1 > R2. So R1/R2 is greater than 1.

But according to the exponents, R1 is exp(16.53) ≈ 1.9e7, R2 is exp(18.05) ≈ 1.2e8. So R1 is 1.9e7, R2 is 1.2e8. So R1/R2 is (1.9e7)/(1.2e8) )= ~0.158, which is less than 1. So this contradicts the problem statement.

So this suggests that perhaps the ratio I'm considering is the wrong way around. Perhaps the ratio is n2/n1, which the problem refers to as 'the ratio decreases' when there are spots. So let's try this.

If the ratio is R = n2/n1. Then R1 (no spots) is higher than R2 (spots).

So R1/R2 would be higher than 1.

Compute R1 and R2.

At T1=6000 K: R1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) )= (g2/g1) * exp(-16.53).

At T2=5500 K: R2 = (g2/g1) * exp(-18.05).

So R1/R2 = exp( (-16.53) - (-18.05) ) = exp(1.52 ) ≈ 4.58.

So the factor is about 4.58. Which is option C) ~4.5.

Wait, that matches one of the options. So the factor by which the ratio R (n2/n1) changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately 4.58, which is option C. So the answer should be C.

But wait, the problem states that the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So if the ratio n2/n1 increases, then n1/n2 decreases. Which aligns with the problem statement. So the factor is R1/R2, which is 4.58, so the ratio n2/n1 is higher when the star doesn't have spots. So when the star has spots, n2/n1 is lower, so n1/n2 is higher (because n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1)). Wait, no: if n2/n1 is higher, then n1/n2 is lower.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting myself tangled. Let me think again.

If the ratio R is n2/n1, and when spots are present, R becomes R2, which is lower than R1.

So R1/R2 is greater than 1.

So the factor is R1/R2= ~4.58. So the ratio of n2/n1 without spots is about 4.58 times higher than when spots are present, which implies that the ratio n1/n2 is lower when spots are present.

Which matches the problem statement. So the factor by which the ratio changes (R1/R2) is ~4.58, so the answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_2\) and \(g_1\) are the statistical weights of the two energy levels, \(\Delta E = E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Parameters:
- **Transition wavelength**: \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\), so \(\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \approx 8.55 \, \text{eV}\).
- **Effective temperatures**:
  - \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (no spots),
  - \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (spots present).
- **Boltzmann constant**: \(k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}\).

### Step 1: Compute the Boltzmann factor for each temperature
The Boltzmann factor is given by:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right).
\]

For \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\):
\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \frac{8.55}{8.617 \times 10^{-5} \times 6000} \approx 16.53,
\]
\[
\exp(-16.53) \approx 6.5 \times 10^{-8}.
\]

For \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\):
\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2} = \frac{8.55}{8.617 \times 10^{-5} \times 5500} \approx 18.05,
\]
\[
\exp(-18.05) \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-8}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the ratio of the populations
The ratio of the populations is:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} \propto \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right).
\]

At \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\):
\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} \propto 6.5 \times 10^{-8}.
\]

At \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\):
\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} \propto 1.4 \times 10^{-8}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the factor by which the ratio changes
The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_2}} = \frac{6.5 \times 10^{-8}}{1.4 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 4.58.
\]

### Step 4: Interpret the result
The ratio \(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\) decreases when the star has spots (lower temperature), which means the ratio \(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\) increases. However, the problem specifies the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. This corresponds to the factor \(\frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_2}} \approx 4.58\).

### Final Answer:
The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately **4.5**, which corresponds to option **C**.

Answer: C
