Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me think through it. Alright, the setup is a spherical conductor with a cavity inside. The conductor itself is uncharged, meaning it starts with no net charge. The cavity has a radius r, which is smaller than the conductor's radius R. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center, but since s is a distance, I think that's okay. Now, inside this cavity, there's a small positive charge +q placed somewhere. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and l is the distance from the cavity's center to P. Also, l and L are both larger than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields and charges. So, when a conductor is neutral (uncharged) but has a cavity with a charge inside, the conductor's charges redistribute. Wait, but in this case, the conductor is uncharged, so what happens?

Right, when you put a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the charges on the conductor will rearrange themselves. But since the conductor is neutral, the inner surface must develop an induced charge opposite to the enclosed charge, and the outer surface remains neutral because the conductor as a whole is uncharged. Wait, no, wait. Actually, I think the inner surface would have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the enclosed charge. So since the charge inside is +q, the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) will have -q. Then, the outer surface would have +q, but wait, no. Because the conductor is neutral, the total charge on the outer surface must be zero? Wait, wait, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral, so the total charge is zero. The charge inside the cavity is +q. So the inner surface must have a charge of -q (induced by the +q), and the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance it, because the inner is -q, and the conductor's total is zero. Wait no, the conductor's total charge is zero. So if inner surface has -q, the outer must have +q so that overall, -q + q = 0. So the outer surface's charge is +q.

Wait, but no, that can't be right because the conductor is neutral. Let me correct that. If the conductor is neutral, the total charge on it is zero. The cavity has +q, so the inner surface must have -q, because that's the induced charge. But then the conductor itself would have to have a charge of +q on the outer surface to make the total of inner (-q) + outer (+q) = 0, which matches the conductor being neutral. So the outer surface has +q, and the inner surface has -q.

Wait, no, wait. The conductor is neutral, so the total charge is zero. The charge inside the cavity is +q. The inner surface of the conductor (cavity) must have an induced charge of -q because the +q charge attracts negative charges. But then the conductor's own material must have a charge of +q on the outer surface to make the total charge zero. So the outer surface is +q.

Wait, no, wait. Because the conductor is neutral, the total charge on it is zero. The charge inside the cavity is +q, so the inner surface must have -q. Then, the outer surface would have +q (because the conductor's total charge is zero: inner is -q, outer is +q, sum is zero). So the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q.

Now, the problem is to find the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor. So P is outside the conductor, which has radius R, and it's located at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, and the angle between l and s (the distance between the two centers) is theta.

Wait, but wait, the conductor is a sphere. So the conductor's center is at some point, and the cavity's center is s distance away from that. So the point P is somewhere in space, and we're considering the electric field at P.

Now, for a point outside a charged sphere, the electric field is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. But that's the case when the charge is on the outer surface. So, in this case, the outer surface has +q. The inner surface has -q, but that's inside the conductor, and for points outside, the inner charge shouldn't matter because it's enclosed within the conductor.

Wait, but wait, the conductor is a shell around the cavity. The point P is outside the conductor, so the electric field there would just depend on the total charge on the outer surface. Because the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So the electric field at point P should be as if all the charge +q is at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but wait. The conductor is a sphere, and the point P is a distance L from the conductor's center. So the electric field at P due to the outer charge +q is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / (L)^2, directed radially outward because it's positive. So that would be option B, perhaps.

But wait, the answer might not be that straightforward. Because the point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, and s is the distance between the two centers. So the distance from the conductor's center to P is L, which is sqrt( (s + l cos theta)^2 + (l sin theta)^2 )? Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Wait, the setup is such that l is the distance from the cavity's center to P, and L is the distance from the conductor's center to P. So perhaps l, s, and L are related via the law of cosines. So, L² = l² + s^2 - 2 l s cos theta. Because when you have two points separated by s, and another point at distance l from one and L from the other, the angle between them is theta.

But wait, in the problem statement, it says that point P is outside the conductor, so L must be greater than R.

But in terms of the electric field at P, since the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, the field at P would be as if a point charge q is located at the conductor's center. So E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², which is option B.

But wait, looking at the options, option B is exactly that. So why is option D present? Option D is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / l², which would be the field if the charge was at the cavity's center. But that's not the case because the charge is inside the cavity, and the conductor's charges rearrange.

Wait, but another approach: consider the method of images. But I think I don't need that here. Alternatively, perhaps using Gauss's Law.

Let me try using Gauss's Law. Consider a Gaussian surface outside the conductor, at radius L. The electric flux through this surface depends only on the total charge enclosed, which is the +q on the outer surface of the conductor. So the flux is E * 4π L² = (q) / ε₀. So E = q/(4π ε₀ L²). That's the same as option B.

So why are the other options there? Let me look at the options again.

Option A: E = (1/(4πε₀)) q/(l - s cosθ)^2. Hmm, that might be if the charge was at a point l - s cosθ away, but I don't think that's the case here. Because the outer surface's charge is distributed on the conductor's surface, so the field outside should only depend on L, the distance from the conductor's center.

Option C: E = (1/(4πε₀)) q/(l + s cosθ)^2. That seems like it's considering the sum of l and s cosθ, but again, I don't think that's right because the field is determined by the total charge at the conductor's center.

Option D: E = (1/(4πε₀)) q/(l)^2. That would be the case if the field was due to a charge at the cavity's center, but the conductor's outer surface's charge is what contributes to the field at P.

So the correct answer should be option B: E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor Properties**: The spherical conductor is uncharged, meaning its total charge is zero. The cavity inside contains a charge $+q$, which induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. To maintain charge neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a point outside a charged spherical shell, the electric field is determined by the total charge on the shell as if it were concentrated at the center of the sphere. Since the outer surface of the conductor has a charge of $+q$, the electric field at point $P$ (a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor) is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: $E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{(l - s \cos\theta)^2}$. This suggests the electric field depends on the distance $l - s \cos\theta$, which is incorrect because the field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$ from the conductor's center.
   - **Option B**: $E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$. This correctly represents the electric field at point $P$ due to the charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.
   - **Option C**: $E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{(l + s \cos\theta)^2}$. This incorrectly modifies the distance to include $l + s \cos\theta$, which is irrelevant for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option D**: $E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{l^2}$. This assumes the electric field is due to a charge located at the cavity's center, which is incorrect because the field outside the conductor depends on the total charge on the outer surface, not the cavity's center.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it accurately describes the electric field at point $P$ based on the charge on the outer surface of the conductor and the distance $L$ from the conductor's center.
