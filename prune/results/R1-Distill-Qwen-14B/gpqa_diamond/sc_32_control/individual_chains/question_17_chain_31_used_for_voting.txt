Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh, and the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10.

Wait, what do I remember about EDTA and these kinds of complexes? Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions, like Ca^2+ in this case. The stoichiometric complex means that each EDTA molecule binds one Ca^2+ ion, right? So the formula would be something like CaY^2- or CaEDTA^2-.

I think the formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, sometimes EDTA exists in different protonated forms depending on the pH. Oh, but the problem says the pH is ideal, so maybe we don't have to worry about that. So we can assume that the EDTA is in its Y^4- form, which is the deprotonated form needed for the complex.

So, the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. That would mean that all the calcium is tied up in the complex, right? Because at such a high K value, the complex is very stable—so almost all the Ca^2+ is in the complex, not free in solution. Wait, but the question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions. So if K is so large, the dissociation of the complex is minimal. So [Ca^2+] would be very low.

Let me think about the equation. Let's denote the concentration of the complex as [CaY] = 0.02 M. The formation reaction is Ca^2+ + Y^4- ⇌ CaY^2-. The K is 5e10. But since the complex is dissociating, the reverse reaction is CaY^2- ⇌ Ca^2+ + Y^4-. The K for the dissociation would be 1/K_form = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, so the dissociation constant Kd = [Ca^2+][Y^4-]/[CaY] = 2e-11. But wait, in solution, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So [CaY] is 0.02. Let's assume that x is the concentration of Ca^2+ that dissociates. So [Ca^2+] = x, and [Y^4-] = x as well, because each dissociation gives one Ca^2+ and one Y^4-.

So, plugging into the dissociation equation: (x)(x) / 0.02 = 2e-11. So x² = (2e-11) * 0.02. Let me compute that: 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13. So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is (2e-6.5)^2? Let me calculate sqrt(4e-13):

sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7. Wait, wait, no: 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, since 6.5 *2 =13. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5 which is 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7. So x ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

So the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C says 6.3e-7 M. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making any mistakes here. Another approach: The formation constant is Kf = [CaY]/([Ca][Y]) =5e10. Since the initial concentration of CaY is 0.02 M, and assuming that x is the concentration of Ca that dissociates, then [Ca] = x, [Y] = x. So 0.02 / (x * x) ) = 5e10 → 0.02/(x²) =5e10 → x² = 0.02/(5e10) → x² = 4e-13 → x = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.3e-7. Yep, same result. So I'm confident that option C is correct.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex. The dissociation reaction is:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

The equilibrium expression for \( K_d \) is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}.
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated calcium ions be \( x \). Since each dissociation yields one Ca²⁺ and one Y⁴⁻, we have:

\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{Y}^{4-}] = x, \quad [\text{CaY}^{2-}] = 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \, (\text{since } x \ll 0.02).
\]

Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_d = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
x^2 = K_d \cdot 0.02 = (2 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot 0.02 = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is:

\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \).**
