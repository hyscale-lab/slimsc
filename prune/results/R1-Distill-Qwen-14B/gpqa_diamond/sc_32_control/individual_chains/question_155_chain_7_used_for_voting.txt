Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's asking.

So, the problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue, and we're given the explicit state vector. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which I think means that the state is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. 

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the variance. So, ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

But wait, since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, which isn't the same as P_z, we can't just say that ⟨P_z⟩ is the eigenvalue. So I'll need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

The state vector is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let's denote this state as |ψ⟩. 

Now, I think the first step is to compute ⟨P_z⟩. That's the expectation value of P_z in the state |ψ⟩. So I'll have to calculate ψ† P_z ψ, where ψ† is the conjugate transpose of ψ.

Looking at the matrix form of P_z: the first row is [ħ, 0, 0], second [0,0,0], third [0,0,-ħ]. So P_z is a diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ.

Wait, but since our state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, each component of the state corresponds to an eigenstate of P_z. So the state is a linear combination of the eigenstates |+z⟩, |0z⟩, and |-z⟩, I think.

The components of the state are (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me check if these components satisfy normalization. Sum of squares should be 1.

Calculating: (-1/2)^2 is 1/4, plus (1/sqrt(2))^2 is 1/2, plus (-1/2)^2 is another 1/4. Total is 1/4 + 1/2 +1/4 = 1. So the state is normalized, which is good.

Now, since P_z is diagonal, its expectation value is the sum of each component of the state squared multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue. Because when you have a diagonal matrix, the expectation value is just the sum over i |ψ_i|^2 * eigenvalue_i.

Wait, but wait: in the eigenbasis, each basis vector is an eigenvector. So for P_z, the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ for the first, second, and third basis vectors respectively.

So the state |ψ⟩ has components a, b, c which are -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2. So ⟨P_z⟩ = a^2 * ħ + b^2 * 0 + c^2 * (-ħ).

Calculating:

a^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. So a^2 * ħ = (1/4) ħ.

b^2 = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2. So b^2 * 0 = 0.

c^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. So c^2 * (-ħ) = (1/4)(-ħ) = - ħ/4.

So sum: (1/4 ħ) + 0 + (-1/4 ħ) = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ = 0.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the expectation value of P_z is zero. Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩?

P_z squared is just the square of each diagonal element. So P_z² would have eigenvalues (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2, which are ħ², 0, ħ².

So the expectation value of P_z squared is a^2*(ħ²) + b^2*0 + c^2*(ħ²).

So a^2 is 1/4, so 1/4 * ħ² = ħ²/4.

c^2 is 1/4, so 1/4 * ħ² = ħ²/4.

Sum: (1/4 +1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z^2⟩ = (1/2) ħ².

Now, the variance is ⟨P_z^2⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩². Since ⟨P_z⟩ is 0, the variance is just (1/2) ħ².

So the uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of this, which is sqrt( (1/2) ħ² )= (ħ) * sqrt(1/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me think again. Oh, because the operator is in the eigenbasis of P_z, so each component's square gives the probability. So since a^2 is 1/4, and c^2 is 1/4, each contributes (1/4) * ħ², so together 1/2 ħ².

So the uncertainty is sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) ) = (ħ) * sqrt(1/2) = ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

Alternatively, I can compute it more formally using the matrix multiplication.

Wait, another approach: since |ψ⟩ is a state vector, and P_z is a diagonal matrix. So to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I can compute ψ† P_z ψ.

But since P_z is diagonal, each component will be multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue.

So ψ is [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T.

So ψ† is [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ].

Multiplying ψ† * P_z gives:

First component: (-1/2)*ħ + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + (-1/2)*0 = (-1/2) ħ. 

Wait, actually, no. Wait, P_z is a matrix with rows [ħ, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0,0,-ħ]. So when you do ψ† multiplied by P_z, you get a row vector where each element is the product of the corresponding element in ψ and the diagonal element of P_z.

So first element: (-1/2) * ħ.

Second element: (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 = 0.

Third element: (-1/2) * (-ħ) = (1/2) ħ.

Then, when you multiply by ψ, you get the sum of these products.

So [ (-1/2 ħ), 0, (1/2 ħ) ] multiplied by ψ: 

( (-1/2 ħ)*(-1/2) ) + (0 * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + ( (1/2 ħ) * (-1/2) ) 

Which is (1/4 ħ) + 0 + (-1/4 ħ) = 0. So yes, ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

For ⟨P_z²⟩, P_z squared is [ [ħ², 0,0], [0,0,0], [0,0, ħ²] ].

So ψ† * P_z² is [ (-1/2) ħ², 0, (-1/2) ħ² ].

Wait, no, each diagonal element is squared. So P_z²'s first diagonal element is (ħ)^2, second is 0, third is (−ħ)^2 = ħ².

So ψ† P_z² is [ (-1/2) * ħ², (1/sqrt(2)) * 0, (-1/2) * ħ² ].

Then, multiplying this by ψ gives:

First term: (-1/2 ħ²) * (-1/2) = (1/4) ħ².

Second term: 0 * (1/sqrt(2)) = 0.

Third term: (-1/2 ħ²) * (-1/2) = (1/4) ħ².

Sum is (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ². So same result as before.

So variance is 1/2 ħ², so uncertainty is sqrt(1/2) ħ = ħ / sqrt(2). That's option B.

I think that's correct. So the answer should be B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The matrix form of $P_z$ is diagonal:

\[
P_z = \begin{pmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is the sum of the probabilities of each basis state multiplied by its corresponding eigenvalue:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

Calculating each term:
- $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar = \frac{1}{4} \hbar$,
- $\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 = 0$,
- $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (-\hbar) = -\frac{1}{4} \hbar$.

Summing these:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, which has eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{pmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is the sum of the probabilities of each basis state multiplied by its corresponding eigenvalue squared:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Calculating each term:
- $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2$,
- $\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 = 0$,
- $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2$.

Summing these:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Uncertainty
The variance is given by:

\[
\text{Var}(P_z) = \langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, we have:

\[
\text{Var}(P_z) = \langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

The uncertainty is the square root of the variance:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\text{Var}(P_z)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
