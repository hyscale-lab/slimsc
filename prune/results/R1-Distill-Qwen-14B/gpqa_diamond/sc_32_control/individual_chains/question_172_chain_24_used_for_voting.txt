Alright, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when atoms are in a star's photosphere, they're under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so we can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2 for a specific energy level. Oh right, the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in different energy states to temperature. The equation is something like n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k_B T) ), where g is the statistical weight and k_B is Boltzmann's constant.

Wait, but in this case, the question says the energy difference is the same for both stars. So E_i - E_j is the same, delta E = 1.38e-23 J. Oh, and the statistical weights (g_i and g_j) probably don't change since they're the same atoms. So that part cancels out or remains the same for both stars.

Let me think. So for star_1 and star_2, their excitation levels are in a 2:1 ratio. So (n_i/n_j)_1 = 2, and (n_i/n_j)_2 = 1. Because star_1 has twice the excitation. 

So, setting up the equations. For each star, we can write:

For star_1: 2 = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k_B T_1) )
For star_2: 1 = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k_B T_2) )

Hmm, since both have the same g_i/g_j ratio, maybe I can take the ratio of these two equations. Let's see:

Divide equation for star_1 by star_2: (2/1) = [ (g_i/g_j exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) / (g_i/g_j exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ]

The g_i/g_j cancels out. So 2 = exp( (ΔE/(k_B)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) )

Wait, let me check that. Because when you divide exponents, you subtract them. So, the exponent becomes (-ΔE/(k_B T1)) - (-ΔE/(k_B T2)) ). Which is ΔE/(k_B) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ). So:

2 = exp( ΔE/(k_B) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Take natural log on both sides:

ln(2) = ΔE/(k_B) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Hmm, but I can rearrange this. Let's see:

ΔE/(k_B) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2)

So,

(1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = (ln(2) * k_B ) / ΔE

Wait, but I'm trying to find the relation between T1 and T2. Let me see if I can express this in terms of T1 and T2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to take the ratio of the two Boltzmann factors. Let me think again.

We have:

n1 = 2 * n2.

Wait, no, actually, the ratio between n_i and n_j is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2. So, perhaps better to think each in terms of their own ratios.

Wait, let me write the equations again.

Equation 1: n1 = 2 * (n_j) --> for star_1, n_i is twice n_j.

Equation 2: n2 = 1 * (n_j) --> for star_2, n_i is once n_j.

Wait, maybe I should write each equation in terms of their own T.

So,

For star_1:

n_i / n_j = 2 = exp( -ΔE/(k_B T1) ) * (g_i/g_j)

For star_2:

n_i / n_j = 1 = exp( -ΔE/(k_B T2) ) * (g_i/g_j )

Hmm, since both have the same g_i/g_j, I can write the ratio between the two as:

2/1 = exp( -ΔE/(k_B T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k_B T2) )

Which simplifies to 2 = exp( ΔE/(k_B) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, that's the same as before. So taking the natural log:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k_B)) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

Hmm, but I want to find a relation between T1 and T2. Let me think about how to rearrange this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the equation as:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) = (ln 2 * k_B ) / (ΔE )

But I'm not sure if that's helpful. Let me think about the possible options given.

The options are all in terms of ln(2) equals some function of T1 and T2.

Looking at the options:

Option A: ln(2) = T2 / T1 --> That would imply an equation where T2 is a fraction of T1, perhaps.

Option B: ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2) ) --> Hmm, not sure.

Option C: ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)^2 --> Seems more complicated, maybe for a different scenario.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) --> Hmm, that looks similar to what I have, but let me see.

Wait, let's get back to the equation.

We have:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k_B)) ( 1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Let me factor this as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k_B)) [ (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ]

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So,

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k_B)) ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 )

But the question gives the energy difference D = 1.38e-23 J. But the options don't have numerical factors. So perhaps the equation is simplified, considering that ΔE/(k_B) is a constant, but in the options, it's not present. So perhaps the equation presented in the options is without the constants.

Wait, but the equation in the options would have the constants, but in the given problem, since ΔE is given, perhaps the options are written in a way that the equation is for T's in terms of the constants.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options again.

The correct equation after rearranging is:

ln(2) = [ (ΔE)/(k_B) ) * (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ]

But the options don't include the ΔE or k_B. So maybe the question expects that the equation is expressed without these factors, perhaps assuming that the ratio has been incorporated. Or perhaps the correct equation is of the form ln(2) equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) multiplied by a factor, but since the options don't include the factor, perhaps the correct option is D, which is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) as the right side.

Wait, but in my derivation, ln(2) equals (ΔE/(k_B)) multiplied by (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So the other terms are present. So the equation would have that, but the options don't have ΔE or k_B, so perhaps the equation presented in the options is missing those terms, meaning that the correct option would be the one that has (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) on the right, which is option D.

So, looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Hmm, but wait a second. Let me double-check the algebra.

Wait, using the earlier equation:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k_B)) * [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]

Which is the same as (ΔE/(k_B)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So, the equation would be ln(2) = (ΔE/(k_B)) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

But none of the options have this. So perhaps the question is about the ratio of the excitation, which is 2, and the energy difference is given, but the options are asking for the effective temperatures in terms of each other.

Wait, perhaps the question is more about the relation between T1 and T2, without involving the constants. So if I rearrange my equation:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k_B)) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

But since ΔE and k_B are known, perhaps this is the correct form. But looking at the options, none of them have a ΔE or k_B term. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, another approach. Let's define the ratio of excitation as n1/n2 = (n_i/n_j)1 / (n_i/n_j)2 = (2)/(1) = 2.

But from the Boltzmann equation, each (n_i/n_j) is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So,

n1/n2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

So,

2 = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Take ln:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

But, again, this leads to the same equation.

Hmm. So the equation is ln(2) equals some constant times (1/T2 - 1/T1). The options, however, don't include the constants, so I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the energy difference is the same for both stars, and the ratio leads to a certain relation between T1 and T2.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to think about the ratio of the excitation. Since star_1 has twice the excitation, then:

n_i/n_j = 2 for star_1, and 1 for star_2.

So, their equation would be:

For star_1: 2 = (g_i/g_j) exp(-ΔE/(k T1))
For star_2: 1 = (g_i/g_j) exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

If I divide these two equations, the g_i/g_j terms would cancel out, so:

2/1 = exp( (-ΔE/(k T1) ) - ( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Which is 2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Taking ln of both sides:

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Then, I can write this as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

So,

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

But the options don't include ΔE or k. So perhaps the equation is written as ln(2) equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), assuming that the ΔE/k term is accounted for. So the correct equation would be ln(2) equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which is option D.

The problem involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where the excitation of iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 is twice that of star_2. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). Using the Boltzmann distribution under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T}\right),
\]

where \( g_i \) and \( g_j \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \( k_B \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature of the star.

For star_1, the excitation ratio is \( \frac{n_i}{n_j} = 2 \), and for star_2, it is \( \frac{n_i}{n_j} = 1 \). Dividing the equations for the two stars eliminates \( g_i/g_j \), leading to:

\[
\frac{2}{1} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_2}\right)}.
\]

Simplifying this gives:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k_B} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k_B} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k_B} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

The options provided do not include \( \Delta E \) or \( k_B \), so the equation is simplified to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches **Option D**. The other options are inconsistent with the derived relationship:

- **Option A**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_2}{T_1} \) does not align with the derived equation.
- **Option B**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 + T_2}{T_1 T_2} \) introduces an incorrect term \( T_1 + T_2 \).
- **Option C**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{(T_1 T_2)^2} \) incorrectly includes a squared denominator.

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]
