Okay, so I have this problem about a transgenic mouse model and some issues with protein overexpression. Let's see what's going on here.

The setup: The researcher wants to study GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're creating a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. To do this, they modified the gene's coding sequence to include a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed as expected.

The problem is to figure out why the overexpression isn't happening. The options are A to D. Let me think about each possibility.

Looking at the sequence provided, which is the plus strand of the construct. I need to figure out if there's something wrong in the coding sequence that's preventing proper translation or protein expression.

First, I'll note that the HA tag is at the N-terminus. The HA tag is typically a peptide sequence derived from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus. It's usually added to proteins for detection purposes, like in Western blotting. So the construct should have the HA sequence followed by GADD45G.

Looking at the sequence, the very beginning is ATG, which is the start codon. So that's good. The next few nucleotides are TAC, which is Tyr. Wait, the HA tag starts with YPYDHH. So the HA tag should be at the beginning. Oh wait, but the HA tag is from the N-terminus, so the HA coding sequence should come right after the start codon.

Wait, no. Let me think. The HA tag is added at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. So the coding sequence should have the HA tag's nucleotides before the start of GADD45G.

Wait, in the given sequence, the first codon after ATG is TAC, which is Tyr. So the first amino acid is Tyr. But the HA tag starts with YPY—so the first part is Y, which is TAC. So perhaps the HA tag is correctly included. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the HA tag isn't there because the sequence starts with ATG TAC, which is the start and then Tyr.

Wait, maybe the HA tag is supposed to be added as a separate coding sequence. So the construct should be HA followed by GADD45G. So the initial part should be the HA tag's coding sequence, then the GADD45G coding sequence.

Looking at the given sequence, the first codon is ATG, then TAC (Tyr), then CCA (Pro), then TAC (Tyr), etc. Wait, that's the start of the HA tag. HA is usually YPYDHH. So the first few codons should be TAC (Y), then CCA (P), then TAC (Y), then GAT (D), etc. Wait, let me check the HA coding sequence.

The HA tag is YPYDHH. So the amino acid sequence is Y-P-Y-D-H-H. So the nucleotide sequence would be:

Y: TAC

P: CCA

Y: TAC

D: GAT

H: CAT (since H is His, which is CAT)

H: CAT

So the initial part of the coding sequence should be ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT CAT CAT ... etc. Wait, the given sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... Let's look:

The sequence begins:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... 

So that's ATG (start), TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), then G... Hmm, wait, GAT is D, then G? Let me see. The sequence after GAT is G, which is G. So the next codon is GAT G?

Wait, let me write the first few codons:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GCT TCC...

Wait, that's:

ATG - M

TAC - Y

CCA - P

TAC - Y

GAT - D

GCT - A

TCC - S

So that's the first part. So the HA tag is Y-P-Y-D-... but then comes D and A, which is not matching the HA tag. Wait, the HA tag after D is H, so maybe the sequence after D is H, but here it's A. So perhaps the coding sequence for the HA is messed up.

Wait, maybe the HA tag is not being correctly included. So the HA tag's coding sequence might have a mistake. Let me think about the options. Option A says the HA sequence has a missense mutation. So if the HA isn't correct, perhaps the protein isn't expressed because maybe it's not correctly recognized by the system, or maybe it's causing a premature stop.

But wait, the issue is that the protein isn't overexpressed. So maybe the HA tag is causing the protein to be targeted for degradation.

Wait, another thought: the HA tag is at the N-terminus, but perhaps the construct lacks a linker sequence between the HA and the GADD45G. Or maybe the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate early.

Option C says the lack of linker is causing proteolysis. Without a linker, perhaps the HA tag is being recognized as a signal for proteolysis. Or, perhaps the HA tag isn't being properly expressed, leading to the protein not being made correctly.

Alternatively, looking at the sequence, maybe there's a stop codon early on. Let me check for in-frame stop codons.

Wait, the given sequence is the plus strand. Let's look for the presence of any TAA, TAG, or TGA codons in the sequence. These are stop codons.

Looking through the sequence:

After the initial part, I'll scan for these.

Looking for TAA: anywhere in the sequence.

Looking at the sequence:

...ATGCCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Looking for TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Looking through the letters:

- The sequence ends with ...GAGTGA3'. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. Wait, let me check.

The last part is ...AGTGA3'. So the last few codons would be GAG TGA. GAG is Glu, TGA is a stop. So, the coding sequence ends with GAG TGA.

Wait, but that's the end of the sequence. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the protein would terminate there. So if the HA tag is in the beginning, and then the GADD45G is after, but the construct ends with TGA, that would cause the protein to stop early.

Wait, but the construct is supposed to be the coding sequence for GADD45G with HA tag. So why is there a stop codon at the end?

Hmm, perhaps the construct is designed to include the HA tag and then GADD45G. So the HA tag is at the N-terminus, followed by GADD45G. But the presence of a stop codon at the end would cause the protein to terminate after GADD45G, which is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the construct includes the HA tag followed by GADD45G, and the stop codon is at the end of GADD45G. So that should be correct. So why isn't the protein being expressed?

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is causing a problem. Let me think about option C: the lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. HA tags are usually followed by a linker if needed, but sometimes, without a linker, the tag could interfere with proper protein folding or could be recognized as a signal for degradation.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag isn't there correctly, leading to a non-functional protein.

Wait, the problem states that the researcher modified the gene's coding sequence by introducing the HA sequence at the N-terminus. So the construct's coding sequence is HA followed by GADD45G. But in the given sequence, does the HA tag's coding sequence have any issues?

Looking at the initial part again:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GCT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC CGG AAA GC... 

So the first few codons are:

M (ATG), Y (TAC), P (CCA), Y (TAC), D (GAT), A (GCT), S (TCC), K (AGA), L (TTA), R (CGC), K (CAA), M (ATG), T (ACT), L (CTG), E (GAA), E (GAA), S (TCC), A (GCG), G (G), etc.

Wait, the HA tag's amino acid sequence should be YPYDHH, which would be TAC CCA TAC GAT CAT CAT... but in the given sequence, after GAT, it's GCT (A) instead of CAT (H). Oh wait, so the fourth codon is GAT (D), fifth is GCT (A). So that's Y-P-Y-D-A, which is not correct for the HA tag. The HA should be Y-P-Y-D-H-H, so the fifth codon should be CAT (H), not GCT (A). So that's a problem.

So the fifth codon after the start is GCT instead of CAT. So that's a substitution of A instead of H. So this is a missense mutation in the HA tag's coding sequence. That would lead to the HA tag being incorrect, which might cause the protein not to be expressed properly or recognized.

But wait, the HA tag is just for affinity purification. If it's incorrect, perhaps the antibody won't recognize it, but the protein itself might still be expressed. But the question says the overexpression isn't happening. So perhaps the HA tag's mutation is causing a problem upstream.

Wait, another possibility: if the HA tag is incorrect, perhaps it's introducing a premature stop codon. But in this case, the HA is followed by GADD45G. Alternatively, maybe the mutation in the HA tag introduces a stop codon earlier, but looking at the amino acids, the HA tag is Y-P-Y-D-A... which doesn't introduce any stop. So the mutation is in the HA tag, making it non-functional, but the rest of the protein should be fine. But why would that prevent overexpression?

Ah, wait, maybe the HA tag is part of a fusion construct that's supposed to be under a certain promoter or in a certain frame. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's mutation introduces a stop codon, but I don't see that here.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag sequence might have introduced a stop codon in the reading frame. Let me check.

The first codon is ATG (M), then TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), then GCT (A). If it was supposed to be CAT (H), then it's a missense. So that's option A: the HA sequence has a missense mutation. That would result in a wrong amino acid in the HA tag.

But how would that prevent the GADD45G from being expressed? Because the HA tag is at the N-terminus, the GADD45G should follow. Unless the mutation causes a frameshift, but in this case, it's a substitution, not an insertion or deletion. So the reading frame remains correct.

Hmm, perhaps another angle: perhaps the HA tag is followed by a stop codon, but no—because after GADD45G, the sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. So the construct is HA followed by GADD45G, ending with a stop.

Wait, but the presence of the HA tag might introduce a stop codon before the end of GADD45G. For example, if the HA tag includes a stop codon, but in the given sequence, the HA tag is Y-P-Y-D-A... which doesn't include a stop. So that's probably not the case.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the HA tag's mutation causes the ribosome to terminate early. For example, if the HA tag's sequence includes a stop codon, the protein would be truncated. But in the given sequence, the HA doesn't have a stop. So that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's incorrect sequence causes the ribosome to produce a peptide that's recognized as a stop signal. But I don't think that's how it works. The ribosome stops only at the stop codon, not due to the amino acid sequence.

Another option is option B: the ribosome terminated the translation early. But why would it do that? Unless there's a stop codon upstream. But in the sequence, the first stop codon is at the end as TGA. So that can't be it.

Wait, but looking again, after the initial HA tag, the GADD45G sequence continues. So the presence of the HA tag shouldn't cause a premature stop unless there's a stop codon within the HA or the GADD45G part.

Wait, perhaps I should look for any internal stop codons in the GADD45G part. Let's see. The HA tag is 6x His? No, HA is a short tag. But in the given sequence, after the HA, the rest is GADD45G. So the GADD45G sequence may have a stop codon.

Wait, but the HA is followed by the GADD45G coding sequence, which should continue until the end. The sequence ends with TGA, which is the stop. So why isn't the protein expressed?

Wait, maybe the construct doesn't have a promoter or the correct regulatory elements. But the question says the plasmid was transfected into CHO cells, so perhaps the promoter is present. The problem is in the coding sequence.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag is in the correct frame. Let me check. The HA tag is a short peptide, so the frame after the HA should be correct for GADD45G. Let's see.

The HA tag is YPYDHH, which is 6 amino acids. So the coding sequence for HA should be 18 nucleotides (6 codons x3). Let's see the given sequence:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GCT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC CGG AAA GC...

Wait, the HA tag is supposed to be 6 codons. The first six codons are:

1. ATG (M)
2. TAC (Y)
3. CCA (P)
4. TAC (Y)
5. GAT (D)
6. GCT (A)

Wait, that's only 6 codons. The sixth is GCT (A). But the HA should be YPYDHH. So the sixth codon should be CAT (H). So the sixth codon is incorrect. This is a substitution of A instead of H at that position.

Therefore, the HA tag's coding sequence has a mutation in the sixth codon, leading to an incorrect amino acid. So this is a missense mutation in the HA tag. So option A would be the correct answer.

But why would that prevent overexpression? Because the HA tag is for purification. If the HA is incorrect, the purification might fail, but the protein might still be expressed. But the problem says the protein isn't overexpressed. Hmm. So perhaps the issue is more about expression.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the HA tag's mutation introduces a premature stop codon. Let me check the sequence after the mutation.

After the sixth codon (GCT), the sequence continues as TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC CGG AAA GC...

So after GCT (A), the next codon is TCC (S). So the amino acids would be Y, P, Y, D, A, S, etc. So no stop codon is introduced. Therefore, the mutation doesn't cause a premature stop, but the HA tag is messed up.

Wait, but if the HA tag is not correctly expressed, perhaps the entire construct is not being translated. Maybe the mutation causes the ribosome to stall, leading to degradation of the mRNA via NMD (nonsense-mediated decay). But NMD typically acts when a premature stop codon is present in the mRNA, causing the mRNA to be targeted for degradation. In this case, there's no premature stop, so NMD wouldn't be activated.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in the HA tag creates a cryptic splice site or something, but that's more in pre-mRNA processing, which probably isn't the case here.

Wait, another thought: maybe the HA tag's incorrect sequence causes the ribosome to terminate early. But the ribosome only stops at the stop codon. So that's not likely.

Alternatively, maybe the HA tag's presence is causing the construct to be out of frame, but since it's a tag at the beginning, it should be in frame with GADD45G.

Wait, perhaps the correct HA tag isn't being expressed because of a mutation, leading to the construct not being expressed at all. But the sequence starts with ATG, so the ribosome should start translating.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me look back at the options.

Option C says the lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. So if the HA tag isn't followed by a linker, maybe the proteasome is degrading the protein because the HA is causing a signal for degradation. But I'm not sure how that would prevent expression—more about protein stability perhaps.

Another possibility: perhaps the HA tag's mutation caused the protein to be misfolded, leading to aggregation and preventing detection, but the question states that the protein isn't overexpressed, which might suggest it's not being made in the first place.

Wait, maybe the HA tag's mutation introduces a stop codon in a different reading frame? No, because the HA tag is in the same frame as GADD45G.

Wait, another idea: the HA tag is added at the N-terminus. If the HA's sequence includes a stop codon, the protein would terminate early. But in the given sequence, the HA doesn't have a stop codon. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is in the wrong frame. No, the HA is a short peptide, so it's designed to be in frame with the GADD45G.

Wait, looking at the sequence again, after the HA, the next part is GADD45G. Let me check if the GADD45G coding sequence is correct. Suppose the HA is wrong, but the GADD45G is correct. Then the protein might be expressed, but the HA might not work. But the question is about overexpression, not about the HA working.

Hmm. So the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed. So perhaps the HA's mutation is causing the construct to not be expressed at all.

Wait, wait. Let me check the initial part of the coding sequence. The first codon is ATG, which is correct. Then TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GCT (A). So the HA is Y-P-Y-D-A..., which is wrong. The correct would be Y-P-Y-D-H-H.

So the HA has a mutation in the sixth codon. So in terms of the protein, the HA would be YPYDA..., which is different from YPYDHH.

But how would that prevent the protein from being expressed? Well, perhaps the mutation is causing the ribosome to terminate. But that's not how it works. Maybe the mutation introduces a stop codon in a different frame? No, because the frame is maintained.

Wait, perhaps the mutation causes the HA tag to be recognized as a signal for proteasomal degradation. For example, certain amino acid sequences can target a protein for degradation. If the HA is mutated, perhaps it's now a signal peptide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is part of a fusion construct, and the mutation prevents the correct structure, making the protein not fold properly, leading to it being degraded.

Another angle: perhaps the HA tag's mutation leads to a frameshift. Wait, no, because it's a substitution, not an insertion or deletion.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag's sequence isn't followed by a linker, causing the GADD45G to be expressed but not detected. But the question is about overexpression, so the construct's expression is the issue.

Wait, looking at the options again, option D says the tRNA for UAA doesn't exist in the mouse. But UAA is a stop codon, and all stop codons are decoded by release factors, so the lack of a tRNA wouldn't affect that. So option D is probably incorrect.

So, back to the options. The issue is that the HA sequence has a mutation. If the HA is part of the construct but is incorrect, perhaps the protein isn't expressed because the construct isn't properly processed. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the HA tag is at the N-terminus, but perhaps the mutation in the HA sequence introduces a stop codon in a different frame. But no, because it's a substitution, so the reading frame remains the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's mutation leads to the production of a truncated protein. But again, looking at the coding sequence, after the HA, the GADD45G sequence continues correctly, ending with TGA. So the protein should be full-length, just with a wrong HA tag.

But if the HA tag is messed up, perhaps the construct isn't expressed because the HA tag includes a stop codon? No, it doesn't. So I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the error is that the HA tag is in the wrong orientation. The sequence is given as the plus strand. So if the HA was added in the reverse complement, it would cause a problem. But the sequence starts with ATG, which is correct, so that's probably not the case.

Wait, maybe the HA tag's mutation caused the construct to have a premature stop codon elsewhere. Let me scan the entire coding sequence for any TAA, TAG, TGA codons beyond the intended stop.

Looking through the sequence:

After the initial part, I see ...GCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Looking for TAA, TAG, or TGA:

Looking for TGA:

...GCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

I see a TGA at the very end. So the only stop codon is the intended one at the end. So the HA mutation doesn't introduce any new stops.

So, circling back, the HA tag's sixth codon is GCT (A) instead of CAT (H). So the HA is YPYD-A..., but it should be YPYD-HH. This is a missense mutation in the HA tag's coding sequence. So option A is correct.

But why would this prevent overexpression? Because the HA is for affinity purification. If the HA is incorrect, the antibody wouldn't bind, so you can't pull down the protein. But the question says the overexpression isn't happening. So perhaps the issue is that the HA tag isn't expressed correctly, which is leading to the entire construct not being expressed.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's mutation is causing a problem in the cloning process. For example, if the HA isn't cloned correctly, the GADD45G might not be expressed. But the sequence starts with ATG, so the GADD45G should be there.

Another thought: perhaps the mutation in the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate early. But the ribosome doesn't terminate early unless there's a stop codon. So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's mutation is causing the mRNA to be unstable. But I'm not sure about that.

Hmm. Maybe the incorrect HA tag introduces a cryptic promoter or something that messes with the expression. But that's more about the promoter region, not the coding sequence.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's mutation creates a stop codon in another frame, but that's not relevant because the reading frame is maintained.

I'm a bit stuck, but based on the given options, the HA sequence has a missense mutation, which is option A. The other options don't seem to fit as well. So I think the correct answer is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The researcher is attempting to create a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein, modified to include an HA tag at the N-terminus for affinity purification. However, the protein is not being overexpressed as expected. The provided coding sequence is analyzed to identify the issue.

The sequence begins with the start codon (ATG) and includes the HA tag coding sequence followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. The HA tag is supposed to encode the amino acid sequence YPYDHH. However, the sixth codon in the HA tag is GCT (Ala) instead of CAT (His), resulting in the sequence YPYDA... instead of YPYDHH. This is a missense mutation in the HA tag's coding sequence.

This mutation does not introduce a premature stop codon or disrupt the reading frame, as the sequence continues correctly for GADD45G and ends with the intended stop codon (TGA). However, the incorrect HA tag sequence could interfere with the construct's expression or detection. The HA tag is critical for affinity purification, and its mutation may prevent proper protein folding, recognition, or stability, leading to the observed lack of overexpression.

Option A correctly identifies the issue as a missense mutation in the HA tag's coding sequence. Other options are less likely: option B (ribosome termination) is incorrect because there is no premature stop codon; option C (lack of linker causing proteolysis) is not supported by the sequence; and option D (tRNA absence for UAA) is irrelevant, as UAA is a stop codon and does not require a specific tRNA.

Answer: A
