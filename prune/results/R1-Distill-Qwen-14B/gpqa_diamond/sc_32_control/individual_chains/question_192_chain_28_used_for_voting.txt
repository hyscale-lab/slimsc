Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the setup says there's an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The cavity isn't at the center because the center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the conductor is R, and the cavity's radius is r, and r is less than R. 

So, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is asking for the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Plus, the angle between l and s is theta. Both l and L are greater than R, so P is outside the conductor.

Wait, okay, I remember that when you have a conductor, the charges reside on the surface. But in this case, the conductor is uncharged, so any charge inside should induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Oh wait, but in a conductor, the free charges can move. So when you put a charge inside the cavity, it induces an opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor, and since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge equal to the cavity's charge. Or wait, no, wait. Wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. So when you put +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will have an induced -q charge. Then, the outer surface must have +q because the total conductor's charge is still zero. But wait, the conductor is neutral, so it can't have any net charge. So the inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must have +q to keep the conductor's net charge zero. Hmm, but wait, the conductor was uncharged, so yes, outer surface has +q.

But then, the point P is outside the conductor. So, from P's perspective, the electric field would be due to the outer surface charge. Because the inner charge (-q on the inner surface and +q in the cavity) would be enclosed by the conductor, their fields inside the conductor would be zero. But outside, the field is as if all the charge is at the center.

Wait, no. Because the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So the electric field outside the conductor would be as if that +q were concentrated at the center. So the field at point P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², right? Because the conductor's outer surface's charge acts as if it's a point charge at the center of the sphere.

Wait, but wait, the charge in the cavity is +q, so the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So the conductor's outer surface charge is +q. So for a point outside, the field is due to that +q, treated as if it's at the center of the conductor. So the field at P would depend on the distance from the center of the conductor, which is L. So the formula would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options, option B is that. Option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So that's the electric field at point P.

But wait, why not consider the cavity's charge distribution? Because the point P is outside the conductor, the cavity's charge and the induced charges on the inner surface are enclosed within the conductor. So their fields outside the conductor would not contribute because the conductor's material itself doesn't allow the fields inside it. Hmm, I'm a bit shaky on that.

Wait, but when you have a cavity with a charge inside, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface. So the fact that the cavity's charge is off-center shouldn't matter because the outer surface's charge distribution is such that it's like a spherical shell. So the field outside would be as if all the outer charge is at the center. So the distance from P to the center of the conductor is L, so E = k q / L².

So the correct answer should be option B.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ (where $r < R$) inside. The center of the cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

When a charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is initially uncharged, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge $+q$ to maintain charge neutrality. For a point outside the conductor, the electric field is determined by the charge on the outer surface of the conductor, as the charges on the inner surface and the cavity are enclosed within the conductor and do not contribute to the field outside.

The electric field outside a spherical conductor is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge located at the center of the sphere. Therefore, the electric field at point $P$ depends only on the total charge of the outer surface ($+q$) and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. Using Coulomb's law, the magnitude of the electric field is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This matches option B. The other options are incorrect because they either incorrectly involve the distance $l$, the angle $\theta$, or the distance $s$, which are irrelevant for the electric field outside the conductor.

Answer: B
