Okay, so I'm looking at this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of Compound X based on the given spectroscopic data and then determine the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to work through it step by step.

First, let me look at the IR data. The IR spectrum shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But since there's no mention of amines here, I'm thinking it's probably an O-H group, like a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Then there's a peak around 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That makes me think it's either a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Wait, the 3400–2500 cm-1 is a broad peak, which is typical for a carboxylic acid (since alcohols can also have broad peaks, but the 1720 might be more specific). Alternatively, maybe an ester? But esters have a carbonyl around 1740, so 1720 might be a ketone or a carboxylic acid. Hmm, but wait, carboxylic acids also have a broad O-H stretch which fits the first IR region.

Then there are peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. These could be aromatic C=C stretches. 1610 is a bit lower than the typical 1450-1600 range, but maybe it's indicating some conjugation or substitution. So perhaps a benzene ring with substituents.

Moving on to the 1H NMR data. Let's list the peaks:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is typically an aldehyde proton. Wait, but 10.5 is a bit low for an aldehyde. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton. Carboxylic acid protons are usually around 10-12 ppm, but they're usually broad because they exchange easily. So maybe this is a carboxylic acid.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet in the aromatic region. So this suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. The two protons are equivalent, so they're probably in a para arrangement with substituents. For example, if there's a substituent on the benzene at the para position, the neighboring Hs would couple as a doublet.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another aromatic doublet. So this is the other set of protons on the benzene ring. So there are two substituents on the ring, perhaps one is a substituent that's meta or para to each other. Wait, but with two doublets each integrating for two protons, that suggests a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. So the substituents are in para positions.

So putting that together, the benzene ring has two substituents in the para positions. One substituent is at position 1, and the other at position 4. So maybe a substituent R and another substituent R', but since both are in para, perhaps the same substituent on both?

Wait, the substituents would be in the para positions. So if in NMR, we see two doublets, each 2H, that's typical for a para-substituted benzene, like para-xylene, but xylene is a di-substituted benzene where the substituents are two methyl groups. But in our case, the substituents might have different groups.

Wait, but the NMR shows 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm. Let's think about substitution patterns. For example, para-substituted with electron-withdrawing groups would deshield the protons, causing them to appear downfield. So perhaps the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl.

Wait, but if the substituent is an -OCH3, that would be electron-donating and cause the protons to be more upfield. Wait, but in our case, the protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield, so that suggests they're in a more deshielded environment. So perhaps the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl group.

Wait, the IR data had a 1720 cm-1 peak, which would suggest a carbonyl. So perhaps the benzene ring has a carbonyl group attached. For example, a para-substituted benzene where one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone or a carboxylic acid) and the other substituent is something else.

Wait, but let me get back to the NMR. The two doublets in aromatic region, each 2H, and each adjacent. So a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. So if substituent A is at position 1, substituent B at position 4, then the protons in positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and those in positions 3 and 5 would also be equivalent. So in that case, each set would have two protons. So the substituents could be at positions 1 and 4, making the ring have substituents at para positions.

So for substituent at position 1, maybe a carbonyl group, such as a COOR or a COOH. Let's think: in the IR, the 1720 peak is a strong carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be around 2500-3000 and broad, which matches the IR. So that might fit.

So perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and another substituent at position 4.

Looking at the other NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet around 3 ppm, maybe a CH adjacent to a carbonyl group. Like a CH2CH2COOH or something similar.

Wait, 2.9 ppm. In a structure like CH2CH2COOH, the CH2 next to the COOH would be around 2.3-2.5 ppm. But 2.9 is a bit higher than that. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH group attached to a carbonyl. Like in a propanoic acid, maybe.

Wait, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be two protons in a CH2 group adjacent to a CH, perhaps part of a substituent like CH2CH2COOH. Then 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH3 group attached to a CH, like a CH(CH3) group. And 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3, like in an ethyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps there's a substituent on the benzene that's an ethyl group or a propyl group attached.

Wait, let me try to build the structure. The benzene ring has a substituent at position 1 (let's say) which is a carboxylic acid (from the IR and NMR), and another substituent at position 4. The substituent at position 4 would have a CH group attached to it, maybe a branching.

Wait, the substituent at position 4 could be a CH2CH2CH3 group, but let me think again.

Looking at the NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Maybe a CH group connected to another group, like a CH2CH2COOH.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet? No, wait, it's a doublet. So a CH3 group attached to a CH which is then attached to something else. Like CH(CH3)– something.

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be two protons on a CH2 group next to a CH group. So maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)– group.

And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3, so perhaps part of an ethyl chain.

Wait, so the substituent would be a propyl group: perhaps a -CH2CH(CH3)2? Or perhaps a -CH2CH2CH3, but that doesn't explain the doublet at 1.4 ppm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a butyl group in some form.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think of the possible structures. Let me try to sketch this out.

The benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group (from the 10.5 ppm peak) at position 1, and at position 4, perhaps a substituent that is a propyl group connected in some way.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Because the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which would suggest a CH2CH2 end.

Wait, sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2–. Wait, no, the structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2– as a substituent.

Wait, so if the substituent is a sec-butyl group (CH2CH(CH3)CH2–), then the protons would be as follows:

The end CH3 (CH2CH2CH3) would be a triplet at around 1 ppm, but in our case, it's a triplet at 0.9, which is typical for a terminal CH3 in an ethyl group.

Wait, but the substituent is at position 4, so perhaps it's a butyl group attached to the ring.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's look at the NMR again. The substituent must have a branching because of the doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H). That doublet suggests a CH3 attached to a CH which is attached to another group. So for example, in an isopropyl group, the CH(CH3)2 would have a singlet for the CH3 groups. But in our case, it's a doublet, which suggests the CH3 is attached to a CH that's next to another group, perhaps a CH2.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group. So that would be a isobutyl group. So the substituent would be isobutyl attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, let's think about the NMR.

The isobutyl group would have:

- The CH(CH3) group: the CH would be a multiplet around 2.9 ppm (since it's attached to two CH2 groups?), but wait, the substituent is attached to the benzene, so the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, that would be a pentyl group. Alternatively, benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something?

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me think about the NMR signals again. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a single proton. So perhaps a CH group that's connected to two other groups. Maybe a CH connected to a CH2 and a CH3.

For example, in a structure like CH2CH(CH3)2, the CH would have neighboring CH2 groups. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think of each signal:

- 10.5 ppm: likely the COOH proton.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): para-substituted benzene.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a CH group attached to something.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): two protons on a CH2 group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal CH3, probably from an ethyl group.

Putting it all together, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Wait, that would make the substituent a isopropyl group attached via a CH2.

Wait, no. Let me think:

If the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3, that would be a pentyl group, but that's too long. Alternatively, perhaps a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that's not right.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an ethyl group with a branch. For example, a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Hmm, but that would be a neopentyl group or something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene, and then a CH(CH3) group attached to it. Let me think:

Benzene ring with a COOH group at position 1 and a CH2CH(CH3)2 group at position 4.

Wait, but then what would the NMR look like? The CH(CH3)2 would have two CH3 groups attached to a CH, which would be a singlet for the CH3s. But in our data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet, not a singlet. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group, but that's a butyl group. Wait, no, that would be a pentyl group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH(CH3) group. Then the structure would have a CH(CH3) attached to a CH2CH2. Let me see.

The protons on the CH2 groups would be at around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), and the CH3 would be at 1.4 ppm as a doublet. The CH would be at 2.9 ppm as a multiplet.

Wait, that's possible. So the substituent would be a CH(CH3)CH2CH2- attached to the benzene ring. Hmm. Or maybe it's a CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. No, that would give a singlet for the CH3.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH(CH3) group, but that might not make sense.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) which is a terminal CH3. So that would be part of an ethyl group. So, perhaps the substituent has an ethyl group attached somewhere.

So, putting it all together, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me think about the possible structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, no, that's a butyl group.

Hmm, maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but I'm not getting it.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group, which is a neopentyl group. But as I thought before, the CH3 groups would be a singlet, but in our data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group, but that seems too long.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH(CH3) group. Then the CH(CH3) would be attached to a CH2CH2. So:

- CH(CH3) would have a CH2 next to it and another CH2 before it.

The CH2 groups would be split into multiplets. The CH(CH3) would have protons adjacent to CH2 groups, so the signal at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would correspond to this CH.

The CH2 groups would be around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), perhaps as a triplet or multiplet, and the CH3 would be at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H). Wait, but why a doublet? Because the CH(CH3) is adjacent to a CH2, which is split into a doublet.

Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is -(CH2)2CH(CH3). So structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-?

Wait, no, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, no, the correct structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2– as the substituent.

Wait, so the benzene ring has a substituent at position 4 which is a sec-butyl group.

So, the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene.

Wait, but that would be a pentyl group. No, wait, the substituent is a butyl group, specifically a sec-butyl.

Wait, the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. So the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's a pentyl group. Wait, no, because the substituent would be a butyl group where the branching is on the second carbon.

Wait, maybe the substituent is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2- attached to benzene? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)-.

So the substituent would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But that would be a pentyl group, but the NMR doesn't seem to have enough protons for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible options given.

Looking at the options:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

So the structure would be a benzene ring with ethyl group at position 4, and a propanoic acid group at position 2. Wait, no, the numbering might be different. Alternatively, the propanoic acid is attached at position 2, and the ethyl at position 4.

But wait, the NMR for the aromatic region shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests para substitution, so positions 1 and 4 on the benzene.

So option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That would mean the benzene has a propanoic acid group at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4. That would mean the benzene is meta-substituted, which wouldn't give two doublets each of 2H. Because in meta substitution, the protons would be in a different pattern.

Wait, but in the NMR, we have two doublets each of 2H. That usually suggests a para substitution. So if the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, each substituent is in the para position relative to each other.

So looking at the options:

Option C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Benzoic acid would have a COOH at position 1, and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

So let's think about that structure.

Benzoic acid (COOH at position 1) and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. Wait, no, a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)–, I think. Wait, the structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2– attached to the benzene ring? No, the substituent is a butyl group where the branching is on the second carbon. So it's -(CH2)2CH(CH3).

Wait, the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. No, wait, a sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- ?

Wait, no, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)- attached to the benzene. Wait, that's a iso-butyl group. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between iso-butyl and sec-butyl.

Wait, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2 (but that's a neopentyl group?), while the sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3)- attached.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look at the structure. The substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group, but that's a pentyl group, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the substituent is a butyl group where the branching is on the second carbon. So it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene? No, that's not correct because that would require four carbons.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene? No, that's a four-carbon group. Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. Hmm, but that would be a pentyl group. I think I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3) group attached to the benzene, making it a iso-butyl group. Wait, but that's a three-carbon substituent.

Wait, let me think again. For a sec-butyl group, the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene ring. So the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, but that's a four-carbon substituent. So the substituent is a butyl group with branching on the second carbon. So the substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, so the substituent would be:

Benzene ring - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2 - ?

No, wait, that's a pentyl group. Hmm, perhaps I should move on.

Looking back at the options, let's see:

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So benzoic acid (COOH) at position 1, and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The substituent at position 4 would be a sec-butyl group. So the structure would be:

Benzene ring with COOH at position 1, and a substituent at position 4 which is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. Wait, no, that's a butyl group.

Wait, the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene.

But then the NMR would show:

- The CH(CH3) would be a CH with adjacent CH2 groups.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the CH(CH3).

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the CH2 groups adjacent to the CH(CH3).

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be the CH3 attached to the CH.

And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) would be the terminal CH3 of the ethyl group (CH2CH2CH3).

Wait, that makes sense. So the substituent is a butyl group where the branching is on the second carbon, making it a sec-butyl group.

So the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, but that's a four-carbon chain, so it's a butyl group. So the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- group.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a pentyl group. Hmm, I think I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

No, that's a neopentyl group, which would have two CH3 groups attached to a CH, which would be a singlet, but the NMR shows a doublet, so that doesn't fit.

Let me think again about the NMR signals.

The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is likely from a CH2CH2CH3 group. So the substituent has an ethyl group attached.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH.

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH adjacent to two CH2 groups.

Putting this together, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, that's a pentyl group, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2- group attached to the benzene, but that's getting too long.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group attached, which would be a butyl group. So let me think of the substituent as a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group.

In that case, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's a pentyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But that's a four-carbon group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. But again, the CH3 would be a singlet, not a doublet.

Wait, maybe it's a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group, but as part of a longer chain.

I think I'm stuck on the substituent's structure. Let me instead look at the reaction part to see if that gives me any clues.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. What reaction involves red phosphorus and HI? Oh, right! The Hunsdiecker reaction, but wait, that's for converting alkyl halides to alkenes. Wait, no, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, but wait, another thought: when a carboxylic acid is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it can form an acid chloride. Wait, no, I think that's when you have a carboxylic acid and PCl5. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI can be used in the presence of alkyl halides, but maybe that's not relevant here.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps it's a reaction where an alcohol is treated with HI and red phosphorus to form an alkyl iodide. Wait, but in this case, Compound X might be an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

But looking back at the spectroscopic data, the IR shows a broad peak around 3400, which is consistent with an O-H group, either from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. The 1720 cm-1 could be a carbonyl from a carboxylic acid.

So if X is a carboxylic acid, then treating it with red phosphorus and HI would likely not form an acid chloride. Wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, but the 1720 cm-1 in IR is a bit low for an ester; esters are around 1740 cm-1.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be the conversion of a nitrile to an amine, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a leaving group is replaced by HI. So if X has a leaving group, like a bromide, then reacting with HI would replace it with iodide. But then why is red phosphorus involved?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are sometimes used to form the phosphorus triiodide (PH3I3), which can be used to substitute halides in alcohols. For example, in the transformation of alcohols to iodides.

Wait, if X has an alcohol group, then treatment with red phosphorus and HI would convert the -OH to -I, forming an alkyl iodide.

But looking back, the IR data shows a broad peak around 3400-2500 cm-1, which is consistent with an O-H, but the 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl. So if X has both a carbonyl and an O-H group, it's a carboxylic acid. So perhaps X is a benzoic acid derivative.

So, if X is a substituted benzoic acid, then reacting it with red phosphorus and HI. Wait, but benzoic acid is a strong acid; would it react under those conditions?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. Wait, maybe X is an ester. For example, if X is an ester, then treatment with HI could perform an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, but that wouldn't involve red phosphorus.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think differently. Let me consider the options and see which one fits the NMR data.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Structure would be:

Benzoic acid group (COOH) at position 1.

A sec-butyl group (-CH2CH(CH3)CH2-) attached at position 4.

Wait, but that substituent would have a longer chain. Let me think about the NMR signals.

So the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

The benzoic acid would have the COOH proton at 10.5 ppm.

The aromatic protons would be at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm as doublets, each 2H.

The substituent's protons would be:

The CH(CH3) group would have a CH at around 2.9 ppm.

The adjacent CH2 groups would be around 1.7 ppm.

The CH3 attached to the CH would be at 1.4 ppm as a doublet.

The terminal CH3 of the ethyl group would be at 0.9 ppm as a triplet.

Wait, but for a sec-butyl group, the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene. So the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a pentyl group. Hmm, no, because the substituent is a butyl group, so it should be four carbons. I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group. So the structure is:

Benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. But that's four carbons: benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- something? Or is it benzene-CH(CH2CH(CH3)CH2-)?

Wait, maybe better to draw it:

The substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the benzene. So the substituent is a three-carbon chain with a branching on the second carbon, making it a sec-butyl group. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because a butyl group is four carbons.

Wait, perhaps I should stop getting stuck on this and just pick the option that fits the NMR.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

NMR would have:

COOH proton at ~10.5 ppm.

Aromatic protons as two doublets, each 2H, due to para substitution.

The substituent's protons: the CH(CH3) would be a multiplet at ~2.9 ppm (1H), the adjacent CH2 groups would be at 1.7 ppm (2H), the CH3 on CH would be a doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H), and the terminal CH3 of the ethyl group would be a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H).

That matches the data given. So option C seems to fit.

Now, the reaction: when Compound X (which is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, but what's the reaction here? Benzoic acid has a COOH group, which is a strong acid. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in reactions involving halides or in the Hunsdiecker reaction, but not directly with carboxylic acids.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group is being converted into an acid chloride. But that usually involves SOCl2 or PCl5, not HI and red phosphorus.

Wait, maybe the reaction is something else. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the benzoic acid to an acyl iodide. But I'm not sure about the conditions for that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of a leaving group.

Wait, if X is a benzoic acid with a substituent that has a leaving group, like a bromide, then reacting with HI and red phosphorus could substitute it. But in option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which doesn't have a leaving group.

Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid. But in that case, the NMR and IR would change.

Wait, what's the reaction between a carboxylic acid and red phosphorus and HI? I'm not recalling the exact reaction, but perhaps it's the formation of an acyl iodide. The reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI can form an acyl iodide. The general reaction is:

RCOOH + PBr3 → RCOBr + H3PO3, but with HI, maybe it's RCOOH + HI → RCOI + H2O. But I'm not certain about the exact conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of an alcohol's -OH with -I, but that would require X to have an alcohol group, which it doesn't in option C.

Wait, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would produce 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid iodide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride, but again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of a nitrile to an amine, but that's unrelated here.

Wait, maybe I should think about what the reaction does. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the presence of alkyl halides to form alkenes via elimination, but that's the Hunsdiecker reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's the substitution of a halide with HI.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of a leaving group in the substituent. For example, if the substituent has a bromide, replacing it with iodide. But in option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which doesn't have a halide.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not directly on the substituent. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is the conversion of the carboxylic acid group into an acid bromide or acid iodide. For that, typically, SOCl2 or PCl5 is used. But red phosphorus and HI might not be the usual reagents for that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the reaction is simply not changing the substituent but the COOH group.

Wait, if X is a carboxylic acid and reacts with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's forming an acyl iodide.

The reaction would be: RCOOH → RCOI, with the release of H3PO3 and water. So in that case, the product would be the acyl iodide.

But the question is asking for the final product, so the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl iodide.

But looking at the options provided, I don't see that as an option. The options are all either acids or substituted benzene rings with substituents.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Wait, but perhaps the reaction doesn't change the substituent but something else. Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester and the reaction is hydrolysis.

Wait, if X is a benzoic acid, then treating with HI and red phosphorus would not change the substituent but perhaps the COOH group. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the -COOH group into an aldehyde. Wait, no, that's not a typical reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of a hydrogen on the substituent with iodine, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on this reaction part. Maybe I should focus on the structure of X first.

Given the NMR and IR data, the structure of X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). Now, when this reacts with red phosphorus and HI, the product would be an acyl iodide, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is forming an alkyl iodide from an alcohol, but in this case, X is a carboxylic acid, not an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not changing the substituent but something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the benzene ring, but I don't see how that would happen with red phosphorus and HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid bromide, but again, I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid. But the initial data suggests X is a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of a nitrile to an amine, but again, that's not applicable here.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think: when a carboxylic acid is treated with excess HI, perhaps it can form a carboxylic acid iodide.

The reaction would proceed as:

RCOOH + HI → RCOI + H2O.

But red phosphorus is often used in such reactions as a catalyst or to remove water. So the product would be RCOI.

But in the options, I don't see an acyl iodide. The options are either acids or substituted benzene rings.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the substituent. For example, if the substituent has a bromide, which is replaced by iodide. But in option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which doesn't have a bromide.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider another structure for X. Let's look at the other options.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

So that's a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4. Wait, but that would make it para-methyl and para-substituted with a sec-butyl group. But the aromatic NMR would have a different pattern.

Wait, but the NMR shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which suggests a para-disubstituted benzene. So option D has two substituents in para positions, a sec-butyl and a methyl.

So, the aromatic protons would be at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. Let me think: the substituents are a sec-butyl and a methyl group. The methyl group is electron-donating, which would deactivate the ring and cause the adjacent protons to be upfield. The sec-butyl group is also an electron-donating group.

Wait, but the NMR shows the aromatic protons at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, which are relatively downfield. Methoxy groups cause protons to be more upfield, but a methyl group is less electron-donating. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group and a sec-butyl group. That would fit if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), which would have a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl at position 4.

So, the aromatic protons would be in para positions relative to the substituents. The COOH group is deactivating and meta-directing, while the sec-butyl group is activating and ortho/para-directing.

In option C, the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl), which are para to each other. So the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. The substituents would cause the protons at 2 and 6 (adjacent to COOH) to be deshielded, appearing downfield, and the protons at 3 and 5 (adjacent to sec-butyl) to be upfield, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the NMR shows 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). Paraxylene would have protons around 7.2 ppm, but with strong substituents, the chemical shifts would change.

Given that, if the substituent is a strong deactivating group (like COOH) and another is an activating group (like sec-butyl), the protons adjacent to the COOH would be downfield, and those adjacent to the sec-butyl would be upfield.

So perhaps the 8.0 ppm is the protons adjacent to the COOH, and the 7.2 ppm is the protons adjacent to the sec-butyl group.

This fits with option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, the reaction part: when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid. But the IR data supports a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acyl iodide. The product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl iodide. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not on the COOH group but on the substituent. For example, if the substituent has a bromide that's substituted by iodide. But in option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which doesn't have a bromide.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a bromide, but that's not the case here.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck on the reaction part. Let me assume that the structure is option C and proceed.

So, the product after the reaction would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl iodide. But since that's not an option, perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is the substitution of the hydroxyl group in the carboxylic acid with iodide, but that would require the -OH to be replaced, which is not how reactions typically proceed. Usually, you form an acid chloride or iodide from the acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not changing X, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the benzoic acid into benzene with a different substituent. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of a hydrogen on the substituent with iodine, but that's not among the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the reaction. Let me consider that the reaction is simply the formation of an acyl iodide, which would be the product. But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying X.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

Let me think about that structure.

Structure: benzene ring with an ethyl group at position 4 and a propanoic acid group at position 2.

Wait, but then the aromatic protons would be at positions 3,5,6, perhaps, but that would complicate the NMR.

Wait, the NMR shows two doublets each integrating to 2H, which suggests a para substitution. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 4.

So option A has substituents at positions 2 (propanoic acid) and 4 (ethyl), which are meta to each other, not para. Hence, the NMR would show a different pattern, perhaps more than two doublets.

Thus, option A is less likely.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

So, substituents at positions 1 (sec-butyl) and 4 (methyl), which are para to each other.

The aromatic protons would then be in positions 2,3,5,6. But the substituents are a sec-butyl and a methyl, both activating groups.

The protons adjacent to the sec-butyl (positions 2 and 6) would be more upfield, while those adjacent to the methyl (positions 3 and 5) would also be upfield but perhaps less so.

The NMR would show two doublets, each 2H, which matches the data.

The substituent at position 1 is a sec-butyl, which would have the same NMR signals as in option C for the substituent.

So the substituent's NMR would be:

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): CH3 attached to CH.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): CH2 groups adjacent to CH.

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): CH group.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): terminal CH3.

The aromatic protons would be at 7.2 and 8.0 ppm as doublets.

So option D's NMR would fit, but does the IR data support it?

The IR data has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. But option D is a di-substituted benzene without a carbonyl group. So the IR wouldn't show a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a problem.

Wait, unless option D is an ester or something else. But looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a di-substituted benzene with no carbonyl group. So the IR data wouldn't fit, because there's a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, indicating a carbonyl.

Thus, option D is unlikely.

So back to option C. The IR data fits the presence of a carbonyl group, which is present in option C as a benzoic acid. The NMR data also fits.

Now, the reaction part: when benzoic acid reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what product is formed?

After some research (in my mind), I recall that when a carboxylic acid is treated with excess HI in the presence of red phosphorus, it forms the corresponding acyl iodide. The red phosphorus acts as a catalyst and helps in removing the water formed during the reaction.

So, the reaction would be:

RCOOH + HI → RCOI + H2O.

In this case, R is 4-(sec-butyl)phenyl.

So the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl iodide.

But looking at the options, none of them match this structure. The options are all either substituted benzene rings or benzoic acid derivatives.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromide substitution, but that doesn't fit here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of an ester to an acid. But in that case, X would be an ester, but according to the data, X is a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of the -OH group in the benzoic acid with HI. But that's not a typical reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a benzene ring with an iodine substituent. But that would require substitution on the ring, which is unlikely under these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an iodobenzene derivative, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the reaction, and the correct answer is option C, and the reaction forms an acyl iodide, which isn't listed, but the closest option is option C itself. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't change X, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not changing the substituent but something else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the structure of X.

Wait, another angle: the reaction conditions (red phosphorus and HI) are used in the preparation of alkenes from alkyl halides via elimination (Hunsdiecker reaction), but that requires an alkyl halide. So if X contains an alkyl halide, the reaction would eliminate to form an alkene.

But in the structure of X as option C, there's no halide. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X has a bromide in the substituent. For example, if the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2Br group. Then, treatment with red phosphorus and HI would substitute Br with I, forming -CH2CH(CH3)CH2I.

But in the given options, there's no such structure.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

If X is option C, the reaction forms an acyl iodide, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct structure is option D, but then the IR data doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not on X's functional group but on the substituent. For example, if the substituent is a brominated group, it would be replaced by iodide.

But in option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which doesn't have a bromide.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck and should proceed to select the best possible option based on the data.

Given the spectroscopic data, the structure of X is most consistent with option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Now, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would likely convert the carboxylic acid group into an acyl iodide, but since that's not an option, perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is converting an ester into a carboxylic acid. But the data suggests X is already a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid bromide, but again, not relevant.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the substituent but the functional group. But without further information, it's hard to say.

Given all that, the best fit for X is option C, and the reaction's product would be the corresponding acyl iodide, but since that's not an option, perhaps the reaction doesn't change X, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the benzene ring, but I can't see how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a benzene ring with iodine substituent. For example, if X is a tosylate or something, but that's not the case here.

I think I've gone as far as I can. Based on the spectroscopic data, the correct structure is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI likely forms the acyl iodide, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the substituent, but without more data, I can't say.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride, which is then treated with HI to form an acid iodide. But again, that's not among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the oxidation or reduction of a functional group, but without knowing the exact reaction, it's hard to say.

In conclusion, based on the NMR and IR data, the structure of X is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI would form the corresponding acyl iodide, but since that's not an option, perhaps the reaction doesn't change X, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl iodide, and the options don't include it, so perhaps I made a mistake in identifying X.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, and the reaction doesn't change the structure, but that doesn't make sense.

I'm stuck. I'll proceed with the conclusion that X is option C and the reaction forms an acyl iodide, but since it's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option C remains. But the options don't reflect that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is something else. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: if X is a substituted benzaldehyde, and the reaction is a substitution, but the data doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of a leaving group in the substituent. For example, if the substituent has a bromide, which is replaced with iodide.

In that case, X would be 4-(sec-butylbromide)benzoic acid, and the reaction would produce 4-(sec-butyl iodide)benzoic acid. But the structure in option C doesn't have a bromide, so that's not applicable.

Hmm, given all this, I think the correct option is C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying Compound X based on its IR and NMR data and determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Here's the analysis:

### Step 1: Analyzing the Spectroscopic Data
#### IR Data:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretches, suggesting a benzene ring.

#### NMR Data:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet, likely from a CH group.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet, likely from a CH₂ group.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet, likely from a CH₃ group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet, likely from a terminal CH₃ group in an ethyl chain.

### Step 2: Identifying the Structure of Compound X
The IR and NMR data suggest that Compound X is a para-substituted benzoic acid. The para substituent is identified as a **sec-butyl group** based on the NMR signals:
- The **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)** corresponds to the CH₃ group attached to a CH.
- The **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)** corresponds to the CH₂ groups adjacent to the CH.
- The **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)** corresponds to the CH group.
- The **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** corresponds to the terminal CH₃ group of the ethyl chain.

Thus, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Step 3: Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI
When a carboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it typically forms an acyl iodide. For **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, the reaction would produce **4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl iodide**. However, none of the provided options correspond to this product.

### Step 4: Evaluating the Options
- **Option A (2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid)**: This structure does not match the para-substitution pattern indicated by the NMR data.
- **Option B (1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene)**: This structure lacks a carboxylic acid group, inconsistent with the IR and NMR data.
- **Option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid)**: Matches the spectroscopic data perfectly, with a para-substituted benzene ring and a carboxylic acid group.
- **Option D (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene)**: This structure lacks a carboxylic acid group, inconsistent with the IR and NMR data.

### Conclusion
Based on the spectroscopic data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid** (Option C). While the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would typically form an acyl iodide, none of the provided options match this product. Therefore, the best answer is **Option C**.

Answer: C
