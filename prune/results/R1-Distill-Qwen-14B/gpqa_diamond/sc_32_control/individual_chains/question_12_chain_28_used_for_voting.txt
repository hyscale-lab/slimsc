Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the kinetic energy of particles after a pion decays. Hmm, let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that a Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles. The options are A to D, each giving two values, probably the KEs of mu and neutrino.

Wait, wait. I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is stationary, the initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

But neutrinos are tricky because they have almost zero mass. Or maybe in this case, their mass is negligible? So the neutrino's energy would be approximately equal to its momentum in units where c=1, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think more carefully.

So the pion is at rest, so its energy is just its rest mass: E_pi = m_pi * c² = 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. But wait, the muon has some kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy, and the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy (since its mass is negligible).

But wait, wait. The muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its energy will be m_mu * c² plus its kinetic energy. But the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy because its mass is negligible (we can treat it as zero for this problem).

So, initial energy: E_initial = 139.6 MeV.

Final energy: E_mu + E_nu = (m_mu c² + K_mu) + (K_nu).

But since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the total momentum after must also be zero. That means the muon's momentum (p_mu) must be equal and opposite to the neutrino's momentum (p_nu). So, p_mu = -p_nu. So their magnitudes are equal: |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

Since the neutrino's mass is negligible, E_nu = p c (in units where c=1, E_nu = p). For the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) = sqrt( p² c^4 + m_mu² c^4 ) / c^2? Wait, no, units are a bit confusing. Let me think in terms of natural units where c=1, so energies and masses are in MeV, and momentum in MeV/c. Hmm, maybe it's easier to work in units where c=1.

Wait, in natural units, E² = p² c^4 + m² c^4. So when c=1, E² = p² + m².

So for the muon, E_mu = sqrt(p_mu² + m_mu²).

The neutrino's energy is just E_nu = p_nu, since its mass is negligible.

Since p_mu = p_nu = p (magnitudes), then E_nu = p.

So, the energy conservation equation is:

E_pi = E_mu + E_nu.

Which in terms is:

139.6 = sqrt( p² + (105.7)^2 ) + p.

So this is an equation with one variable p. Let's denote p as x for easier writing. So:

139.6 = sqrt( x² + (105.7)^2 ) + x.

I need to solve for x.

Let me rearrange the equation:

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2 ) = 139.6 - x.

Now, square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expand the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*x + x².

So,

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 *x + x².

Subtract x² from both sides:

(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 *x.

Now, compute the squares numerically.

105.7 squared: let's calculate that. 100^2 is 10,000. 5.7^2 is 32.49. The cross term is 2*100*5.7=1140. So (105.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 + (5.7)^2 = 10,000 + 1,140 + 32.49 = 11,172.49.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 105.7 is 100 +5.7, so (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b².

So (105.7)^2 = (100 + 5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 + (5.7)^2.

Which is 10,000 + 1,140 + 32.49 = 11,172.49 MeV².

Similarly, (139.6)^2: Let me compute that.

139.6^2: (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2.

140^2 is 19,600.

2*140*0.4 = 112.

0.4^2 = 0.16.

So 19,600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19,600 - 112 is 19,488, plus 0.16 is 19,488.16.

So back to the equation:

11,172.49 = 19,488.16 - 2 *139.6 * x.

Let me compute 2 *139.6 = 279.2.

So,

11,172.49 = 19,488.16 - 279.2 x.

Rearranging,

279.2 x = 19,488.16 - 11,172.49.

Calculate 19,488.16 - 11,172.49.

19,488.16 minus 11,172.49: Let's subtract 11,000 from 19,488.16 to get 8,488.16. Then subtract another 172.49: 8,488.16 - 172.49 = 8,315.67.

So,

279.2 x = 8,315.67.

x = 8,315.67 / 279.2.

Compute that division.

Let me see: 279.2 * 29 = ?

279.2 * 30 is 8,376. But 30 is 8,376. So 29 is 8,376 - 279.2 = 8,096.8.

Wait, wait, maybe another approach.

Wait, 279.2 * 30 = 8,376.

But we have 8,315.67.

So 8,376 is 60.33 more than 8,315.67.

So 30 - (60.33 / 279.2) ≈ 30 - 0.216 ≈ 29.784.

Wait, but let me compute 279.2 times 29.78:

Wait, perhaps I should just do the division more accurately.

8,315.67 divided by 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is larger than 8315.67. So 30 is too big. So the result is less than 30.

Let me compute 279.2 * 29.78.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator approach: 8315.67 / 279.2.

Compute 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30=8376 minus 279.2, so 8376-279.2=8096.8.

We have 8,315.67 -8,096.8 = 218.87.

So now, 279.2 * x = 218.87, where x is the decimal part beyond 29.

x ≈ 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ around 0.783.

So total x ≈29 + 0.783 =29.783.

Wait, but wait, 279.2 * 29.783 ≈ 279.2 *29 + 279.2 *0.783 = 8096.8 + (279.2 *0.783).

Compute 279.2 *0.783.

Let me compute 279 * 0.783: 0.783 * 200 =156.6, 0.783 *79= 61.617. So total ≈156.6 +61.617= 218.217. So 279.2 *0.783≈218.7.

So 279.2 *29.783 ≈8096.8 +218.7=8315.5, which matches our earlier number. So x ≈29.783.

So x ≈29.783 MeV/c.

Wait, x is the magnitude of the neutrino's momentum, and same for muon's. So E_nu = x ≈29.783 MeV.

And E_mu is sqrt(x² + m_mu²) ≈ sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Compute (29.783)^2: approximately (30)^2=900, but 29.783 is a bit less. Let's compute 29.783^2.

= (30 - 0.217)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.217 + (0.217)^2 ≈900 -13.02 +0.047≈887.027.

Then, 105.7^2 is 11172.49 as computed earlier.

So E_mu^2 = 887.027 + 11172.49 = 12059.517.

So E_mu = sqrt(12059.517) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, but that's the total energy of the muon. Its rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so the kinetic energy K_mu is E_mu - m_mu c² = 109.81 - 105.7 =4.11 MeV.

Hmm, wait, that's approximately 4.11 MeV. And the neutrino's KE is E_nu = x ≈29.783 MeV.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. Close.

Wait, but let me recheck my calculations for any possible errors.

Wait, when I computed E_mu, I did sqrt(29.783^2 +105.7^2). Let me recalculate 29.783 squared more accurately.

29.783 squared:

= 29 *29 = 841.

Wait, wait no, that's not right. Let me do it as (29.783)^2.

= (30 - 0.217)^2 = 30^2 - 2 *30 *0.217 + (0.217)^2.

= 900 - 13.02 + 0.047.

Which is 900 -13.02 is 886.98, plus 0.047 is 887.027.

So E_mu = sqrt(887.027 +11172.49) = sqrt(12059.517) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So K_mu = 109.81 -105.7 =4.11 MeV, which rounds to about 4.12 MeV.

E_nu is x, which was approximately 29.78 MeV, which rounds to 29.8 in option D.

So the KEs are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, which is option D.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is "4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV." So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but another way to think about this: the kinetic energy of the muon is much less than the neutrino's KE? Because the muon is heavy, but the neutrino is very light, so the muon doesn't get much kinetic energy, while the neutrino carries away a higher KE. Because the pion's rest mass is 139.6, and the muon's rest is 105.7, so the available energy is around 139.6-105.7=33.9 MeV, but that's the maximum possible energy for the products. But wait, because the neutrino is nearly massless, it can carry away energy. Hmm, but according to our calculation, the KE of the muon is about 4 MeV and the neutrino about 29.8 MeV, which adds up to 33.9 MeV, which is 139.6 -105.7 =33.9. So that makes sense.

Wait, but wait, let me compute 4.12 +29.8=33.92, which is about 33.9, which is 139.6-105.7. So that matches.

So the answer should be option D.

To determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino after the stationary pion decays, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The pion is initially at rest, so its total energy is equal to its rest energy: 

\[
E_{\pi} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

After the decay, the total energy is shared between the muon and the neutrino. The muon's total energy is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy, while the neutrino's energy is purely kinetic (since its mass is negligible). Denoting the muon's rest energy as \(m_{\mu} c^2 = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\), the total energy conservation equation is:

\[
E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu},
\]

where \(E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}\) (from the relativistic energy-momentum relation) and \(E_{\nu} = p\) (since the neutrino's mass is negligible). Additionally, momentum conservation requires that the magnitudes of the muon's and neutrino's momenta are equal and opposite, so \(p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} = p\).

Substituting \(E_{\nu} = p\) and \(E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}\) into the energy conservation equation:

\[
139.6 = \sqrt{p^2 + (105.7)^2} + p.
\]

Rearranging and solving for \(p\):

\[
\sqrt{p^2 + (105.7)^2} = 139.6 - p,
\]

\[
p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
p^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2p + p^2,
\]

\[
279.2p = 19488.16 - 11172.49,
\]

\[
279.2p = 8315.67,
\]

\[
p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus, the neutrino's kinetic energy is \(E_{\nu} = p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}\).

For the muon, its total energy is:

\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]

Calculating:

\[
(29.78)^2 \approx 887.03, \quad (105.7)^2 = 11172.49,
\]

\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{887.03 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.52} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The muon's kinetic energy is:

\[
K_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} c^2 = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus, the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.**
