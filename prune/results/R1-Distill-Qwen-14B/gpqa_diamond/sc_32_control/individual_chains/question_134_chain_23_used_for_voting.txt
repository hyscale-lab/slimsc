Okay, so I've got this problem about enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some acids and a base. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy change when they're mixed. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water. Since enthalpy of neutralization is typically per mole of H+ or OH- ions involved, I should probably calculate the moles of each ion from the given solutions.

Wait, but wait. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, sulfuric acid is diprotic, right? Which means it can donate two H+ ions. But wait, when mixed with a base, only the first dissociation is complete, and the second might not be, but in the case of neutralization with a strong base, maybe both H+ ions are involved. Or do I need to consider that?

And Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Since it's Ba(OH)2, each formula unit releases two OH- ions, right? Because Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2OH-.

So my plan is to calculate the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base, then determine how much of each is available for neutralization. The limiting reagent will determine how much reaction occurs, and thus the enthalpy change.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, find the moles of each component.

For HCl:
Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = Molarity * Volume = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles.

HCl → H+ + Cl- so each mole gives one mole of H+. So 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4:
Volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.

H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. The first H+ dissociates completely because it's a strong acid. The second might not, but in neutralization with a strong base, maybe both are considered. Wait, no. Actually, for the enthalpy of neutralization, I think we consider each H+ from the acid. So for H2SO4, each mole gives 2 H+ ions. So 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

Wait, but wait. Some sources say that the second H+ in H2SO4 isn't completely dissociated, but in the context of neutralization, perhaps both are involved because the base is strong. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe only the first H+ is considered because the second is weak. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no. H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Wait, no. Actually, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, no. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, sulfuric acid is a strong acid, but it's diprotic. The first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, no. Wait, wait, no. Let me correct that.

Wait, no. The first dissociation of H2SO4 is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, that's not right. Wait, actually, the first dissociation (the first H) is complete. The second isn't. So, H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- is not correct. The correct first dissociation is H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^- (which is complete), and then HSO4^- ⇌ H+ + SO4^2- (which isn't complete). So, in the first step, each mole of H2SO4 gives one mole of H+ (from the first dissociation). But wait, no, wait. No: the formula is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No. Wait, no, wait, no. Oh, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let's clarify.

Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is complete because it's a strong acid:

H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No. Wait, no. Wait, first dissociation: H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^- (completely dissociates). The second dissociation is HSO4^- ⇌ H+ + SO4^2- (which is a weak acid, so doesn't dissociate completely).

So, for each mole of H2SO4, we get 1 mole of H+ from the first dissociation, and only a partial amount from the second. But in the context of neutralization with a strong base, perhaps we can consider that both H+ are available because the base is strong enough to react with both.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let's think: when we add a strong base like Ba(OH)2, which provides OH- ions, it will neutralize all available H+ ions. So, for the H2SO4, each mole contributes two H+ ions, but maybe only considering the first one fully. Or perhaps, for the purpose of calculating neutralization, we take both H+ as available because the second H+ can react when provided with enough OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps in the neutralization calculation, we treat H2SO4 as providing two H+ ions. Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here, but maybe I should proceed under the assumption that both H+ are available for neutralization because the base is strong enough to react with them.

Wait, another approach: when you mix an acid and a base, the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The total moles of H+ from all acids and OH- from the base determine the extent of reaction.

So, for HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+ (assuming both H+ are available).

Ba(OH)2: Volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Since each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions, the moles of OH- are 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Now, the total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

The OH- available is 0.2 moles.

So, the neutralization reaction will proceed until one of the ions is used up. The limiting reagent here is OH- because 0.2 < 0.28.

So, all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, using 0.2 moles of H+.

So, the moles of H+ remaining: 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles. But for the purpose of enthalpy, I think the heat released is due to the neutralization of the available OH- with H+.

Wait, but wait. The neutralization process involves H+ and OH- combining. The amount of heat released depends on how much of them reacts. So, the heat is for the moles of H+ and OH- that actually react.

So, 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+.

But wait, actually, each mole of H+ reacts with one mole of OH- to form one mole of H2O. So, the moles of H2O formed are 0.2 moles.

The enthalpy of neutralization is usually given per mole of H+ neutralized. The standard value is about -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and strong bases (like HCl and NaOH). But wait, here, the base is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. The acid is HCl and H2SO4.

Wait, but wait. The enthalpy of neutralization is typically per mole of H+ from the acid. So, if you have 2 H+ from H2SO4, each contributes to the neutralization.

But wait, in this problem, the neutralization is between the H+ from all the acids and the OH- from the base.

So, the total H+ is 0.28, and OH- is 0.2. So, 0.2 moles of H+ will react, leaving 0.08 moles of H+ unreacted.

But wait, no: the OH- is 0.2, so 0.2 moles of H+ will react with it, regardless of their source.

So, the moles of H+ reacting are 0.2 moles, which comes from both HCl and H2SO4.

But for the enthalpy calculation, each mole of H+ contributes to the enthalpy change. So, the total enthalpy change would be (moles of H+ reacting) * (enthalpy per mole).

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the enthalpy of neutralization is calculated when these are mixed. So, the reaction is the combination of H+ from all acids and OH- from the base.

But wait, perhaps I should compute the stoichiometry accurately.

Another approach: write the net ionic equation.

H+ (from HCl and H2SO4) + OH- (from Ba(OH)2) → H2O.

The total moles of H+ is 0.28, and OH- is 0.2.

The reaction will proceed until either H+ or OH- is exhausted. Since OH- is less, all OH- will react, leaving some H+.

The amount of H+ that reacts is 0.2 moles.

So, the heat released is due to 0.2 moles of H+ reacting.

Assuming each mole of H+ reacts with OH- to produce water, and the enthalpy change per mole is -57 kJ (for strong acid and base). But wait, wait. Wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid in the first dissociation, but the second may not be. So perhaps only the first H+ from H2SO4 is considered as a strong acid, and the second may require more consideration.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about it again. The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is around -57 kJ per mole of H+ neutralized. But if the acid is not strong, the enthalpy change is higher because the reaction is not as exothermic.

In this problem, HCl is a strong acid, so each H+ contributes -57 kJ. H2SO4's first H+ is strong, so that also contributes -57 kJ. But the second H+ is from a weaker acid (HSO4^-), so its neutralization has a higher enthalpy (i.e., less exothermic, perhaps even endothermic).

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether the H2SO4 is concentrated or not, but in this case, when mixed with a strong base, perhaps we can assume both H+ are available for neutralization. So, both contribute to the enthalpy.

Alternatively, maybe the second H+ isn't neutralized because the base is strong enough to take all the available H+. I'm a bit stuck on this, but perhaps the problem assumes that all H+ from all sources are available for neutralization.

Wait, but let's proceed with the numbers. So, the neutralization will involve 0.2 moles of H+ reacting with 0.2 moles of OH-.

Each mole of H+ contributes -57 kJ.

So, total enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but let me check the calculations again.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 H+ (assuming both H+ are available).

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

Available OH- = 0.2.

So, OH- is limiting, 0.2 moles H+ will react.

Each H+ contributes -57 kJ.

So, 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but wait. The options given are in kcal and kJ. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Hmm. So, my calculation gave -11.4 kJ, which is option D if it was -11.4 kJ. But option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, which units?

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the units. Let me check.

Wait, the calculation I did was in kJ, but the options have some in kcal and some in kJ. Oh. So I need to convert.

Wait, wait, but wait. Let's double-check the standard enthalpy of neutralization. The standard value is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ for strong acids and bases. But sometimes it's given in kcal. Since 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ.

So, if the enthalpy is -57 kJ per mole H+, then 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. Which is option D: -16.0 kJ. No, wait, option D is -16.0 kJ. But I got -11.4, which isn't one of the options except for D if it's that, but option D is -16.0 kJ. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the moles.

Wait, HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 H+ (if both H+ are considered).

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

H+ total: 0.28.

OH-: 0.2.

So, moles of H+ reacting = 0.2.

But wait, the problem is that H2SO4 is diprotic, but does each mole provide two H+? Because in reality, the first dissociation is complete, providing one H+ per mole, and the second is partial. If only the first H+ is considered, then H2SO4 contributes 0.09 moles H+.

Wait, that would change things. Let me recalculate.

If H2SO4 only contributes 0.09 moles H+ (because first H+ is strong, second is weak and not dissociated much), then total H+ is 0.1 (HCl) + 0.09 (H2SO4) = 0.19.

OH- is 0.2.

So, H+ is limiting now, since 0.19 < 0.2. So, all 0.19 moles of H+ will react.

Wait, but that's not right because OH- is in excess. Wait, no, if H+ is 0.19 and OH- is 0.2, then H+ is the limiting reagent, so all 0.19 H+ reacts, and 0.01 moles of OH- remain.

So, moles of H+ reacting is 0.19, OH- used is 0.19.

In that case, enthalpy change is 0.19 * (-57) kJ = -10.83 kJ.

But that's not matching any of the options either.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again about the H2SO4 dissociation.

H2SO4 is a strong acid in the first dissociation: H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^-. The second dissociation is HSO4^- ⇌ H+ + SO4^2-, which is weak. So, in a solution, only the first H+ is fully available, the second may not be. But when a strong base like Ba(OH)2 is added, which is a strong base, will it neutralize the H+ from HSO4^- as well?

I think in such a case, even the second H+ would be neutralized because the base is strong enough to deprotonate HSO4^-.

So, perhaps each mole of H2SO4 contributes two moles of H+ available for neutralization.

So, original calculation of 0.18 H+ from H2SO4 is correct.

So, H+ total is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

OH- is 0.2.

So, OH- is limiting. 0.2 H+ reacts.

So, enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have -11.4 kJ. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) -2.72 kcal → approx -2.72 *4.184 ≈ -11.4 kJ.

Ah! So option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately -11.4 * 4.184 ≈ 47.5 kJ, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, no. Because 1 kcal is ~4.184 kJ. So, for example, 11.4 kJ is about 2.726 kcal (because 11.4 / 4.184 ≈ 2.726).

So, if the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ, that's approximately -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me check:

11.4 kJ = 11400 J.

1 kcal is 4184 J.

So, 11400 J / 4184 J/kcal ≈ 2.726 kcal.

So, 0.2 moles * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ = -2.726 kcal.

Which would match option A.

But wait, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ.

So, if the calculation is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal, the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but wait. How can the same reaction have different units? Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is given per mole of acid, not per mole of H+.

Wait, for HCl, which is monoprotic, the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of HCl. For H2SO4, since it's diprotic, each mole contributes two H+, so the enthalpy is about -114 kJ per mole of H2SO4 (since 2 *57 kJ).

So, perhaps I should calculate the total enthalpy change for each acid and sum them.

So, for HCl: 0.1 moles. Enthalpy change = 0.1 * (-57) = -5.7 kJ.

For H2SO4: 0.09 moles. Each mole contributes 2 * (-57) = -114 kJ.

So, 0.09 * (-114) = -10.26 kJ.

Ba(OH)2: provides 0.2 moles OH-.

But wait, the OH- comes from Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles OH-.

In the neutralization, the OH- reacts with H+.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization for each acid is considered.

But I'm getting a bit tangled up.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the total moles of H+ and OH-, find the limiting reagent, and calculate based on that.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- = 0.2 moles.

Limiting reagent is OH-, so 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized.

Each H+ contributes -57 kJ. So total is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Which is approximately -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.726).

So the answer would be option A, -2.72 kcal.

But then why is option B -11.42 kcal? That's about -48 kJ, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial mole calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate all the moles.

HCl: 500 mL (0.5 L) * 0.2 M = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL (0.3 L) * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL (0.2 L) * 0.5 M = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles OH-.

So, H+ = 0.28, OH- = 0.2.

So, moles reacting: 0.2 H+.

Enthalpy: 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ → approximately -2.72 kcal.

So, option A.

But wait, why is option D -16.0 kJ? Did I miscalculate the moles?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the acid dissociation. Let me think, did I count the H+ correctly?

Wait, for H2SO4, each mole gives 2 H+ only if both are available. If only the first is available, then each mole gives 1 H+.

In that case, H2SO4 would contribute 0.09 moles H+.

HCl is 0.1 moles H+.

Total H+ is 0.19.

OH- is 0.2.

So, H+ is limiting, 0.19 moles react.

Enthalpy change: 0.19 * (-57) = -10.83 kJ → approximately -2.588 kcal.

But that's not matching any option either.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the initial assumption that both H+ are available is correct.

Thus, the calculation leads to -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal, option A.

But wait, the option D is -16.0 kJ, which is much larger.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong enthalpy value. Maybe the standard enthalpy is -57 kcal/mol?

No, that can't be. Because 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal (since 57/4.184 ≈ 13.6).

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy per mole of H+ is -57 kcal/mol? No, that's way too high because 1 mole of H+ would release 57 kcal, which is 240 kJ, which is very high and not standard.

Wait, perhaps I got the units wrong. Let me check.

In some contexts, enthalpy of neutralization is given in kcal. So, perhaps the standard value is -57.3 kcal/mol for H+.

Wait, no, because 57.3 kcal is about 240 kJ, which is too high.

Wait, perhaps the standard value is -1.0 kcal per mole of H+? No, that's way too low.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up kJ and kcal. Let me check.

Wait, 1 kJ is approximately 0.239 kcal. So, 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal.

So, if the calculation is 0.2 moles * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal.

So, the correct answer would be option A.

But looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about five times higher in kJ. Because 11.42 kcal is about 48.6 kJ. Which doesn't match with our calculation of 11.4 kJ.

So, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation of moles.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles of H2SO4.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles.

Each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles H+ → 0.09 *2 = 0.18.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 → 0.1 H+.

Total H+ = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 moles → 0.2 moles OH-.

So, yes, moles reacting is 0.2.

Enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Which is -2.72 kcal.

So, option A.

But why is option B present? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong enthalpy value. Maybe the enthalpy is -57 kJ per mole of H+ for the reaction. But perhaps in this problem, it's considering enthalpy per mole of acid.

Wait, for HCl, each mole contributes 1 H+, so 0.1 moles → 0.1 * (-57) = -5.7 kJ.

For H2SO4, each mole contributes 2 H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 H+ → 0.18 * (-57) = -10.26 kJ.

Total enthalpy change would be the sum of both: (-5.7) + (-10.26) = -15.96 kJ ≈ -16.0 kJ.

Which matches option D.

Wait, this is conflicting. So why the discrepancy?

Ah! Because the neutralization of H2SO4 with a base may involve two steps:

1. H2SO4 + 2 NaOH → Na2SO4 + 2 H2O.

But in terms of enthalpy, each mole of H+ from H2SO4 contributes -57 kJ.

So, the total H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18.

HCl contributes 0.1 H+.

Total H+ is 0.28. But only 0.2 reacts because OH- is 0.2.

So, the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But if the problem assumes that all the H+ from both acids are available, then the OH- is the limiting reagent, and the calculation would be -11.4 kJ, which is option A in kcal.

But if the problem assumes that the H2SO4 only contributes one H+ (the first), then the total H+ is 0.19, and the enthalpy would be 0.19 * (-57) = -10.83 kJ, which is around -2.58 kcal, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is written incorrectly, but I have to go with the given options.

Wait, another approach: the problem states that all three solutions are mixed. So the total volume is 500 + 300 + 200 = 1000 mL = 1 L.

But perhaps I should compute the concentrations after mixing.

But that's probably not necessary because the moles are additive.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of equivalents.

Equivalents of H+ = (moles HCl * 1) + (moles H2SO4 * 2) = 0.1 *1 + 0.09 *2 = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

Equivalents of OH- = moles Ba(OH)2 * 2 = 0.1 *2 = 0.2.

So, the reaction will proceed until 0.2 equivalents of H+ and OH- react.

The excess H+ is 0.08 equivalents.

So, the heat released is based on 0.2 equivalents of H+ reacting.

Assuming each equivalent releases 57 kJ, the total is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Which is approximately -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.726).

So, the answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation in kJ, so -11.4 kJ would not match any of the options except D (-16.0 kJ), which is not correct. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: perhaps Ba(OH)2 is a strong base but when it reacts with H2SO4, the reaction releases more heat because it's a diprotic acid reacting with a strong base.

Wait, but enthalpy of neutralization is generally per mole of H+ or OH-.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization for H2SO4 is -114 kJ per mole (2 *57 kJ). So, for 0.09 moles, it's 0.09 * (-114) = -10.26 kJ.

HCl: 0.1 * (-57) = -5.7 kJ.

Total: -15.96 kJ, which is approximately -16.0 kJ, option D.

Ah, this makes sense.

So, the reasoning is that each mole of H2SO4 contributes two moles of H+, each releasing 57 kJ.

So, the total for H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 *57 = 10.26 kJ.

Wait, no, wait. H2SO4 is 0.09 moles, each contributes 2 H+, so 0.18 H+. Each H+ is -57 kJ, so the total for H2SO4 is 0.18 * (-57) = -10.26 kJ.

HCl: 0.1 * (-57) = -5.7 kJ.

Total: -10.26 + (-5.7) = -15.96 kJ ≈-16.0 kJ. So option D.

But wait, but earlier calculation said that only 0.2 moles of H+ react.

Hmm, this is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers all the H+ from all the acids and all the OH- from the base, and calculates the maximum possible neutralization.

But in reality, the limiting reagent is OH-, so only 0.2 H+ reacts, giving -11.4 kJ. But why is option D -16.0 kJ present?

I think I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization for H2SO4 is considered per mole of acid, not per mole of H+.

So, for HCl: 0.1 moles → 0.1 * (-57) = -5.7 kJ.

For H2SO4: 0.09 moles → 0.09 * (-114) = -10.26 kJ.

Total: -5.7 -10.26 = -15.96 kJ ≈-16.0 kJ. Which is option D.

But wait, that's the total enthalpy of neutralization for all the H+ from both acids, assuming that all of them are neutralized. But in reality, the OH- is only 0.2 moles, which can only neutralize 0.2 moles of H+.

So, perhaps I should only calculate the enthalpy for the H+ that actually reacts.

So, the OH- is 0.2 moles, which can neutralize 0.2 moles of H+.

So, the H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4.

HCl provides 0.1 H+, which is less than 0.2, so all of HCl's H+ is neutralized, which is 0.1 moles.

The remaining 0.1 moles of OH- can neutralize H+ from H2SO4.

H2SO4 provides 0.18 H+.

So, 0.1 moles of H+ from H2SO4 are neutralized, leaving 0.08 H+ unreacted.

So, the total enthalpy change is (0.1 H+ from HCl + 0.1 H+ from H2SO4) * (-57 kJ/mol) = 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Which is option A in kcal.

But the problem gives options in both kcal and kJ, so this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the total possible neutralization, assuming all H+ and OH- are available, but that's not the case here.

Wait, but the problem states that all three solutions are mixed, so the neutralization occurs based on the available H+ and OH-.

So, the correct approach is to find the limiting reagent, which is OH-, and calculate the enthalpy for the amount of H+ that reacts.

So, the calculation is 0.2 moles H+ → 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal.

So, the correct answer is option A.

But then why is option D present? Maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, the problem says to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when the three are mixed. So, perhaps the total heat is based on all H+ and OH- reacting, but that's not possible because one is limiting.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization, like -57 kcal per mole.

Wait, that can't be because 57 kcal is way too large.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done in terms of the total H+ and OH- available, not considering stoichiometry.

Wait, but that would be incorrect.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Based on my calculations, the correct answer should be option A, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumptions.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are taken:

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻
1. **HCl (strong acid):**  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Since HCl dissociates completely, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).

2. **H₂SO₄ (diprotic acid):**  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Each mole of H₂SO₄ provides 2 moles of H⁺ (assuming both dissociate completely).  
   Total H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).

3. **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ provides 2 moles of OH⁻.  
   Total OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).

### Step 2: Determine the limiting reagent
The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \).  
Total moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).  
Total moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).  

Since OH⁻ is limiting, only \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \) will react.

### Step 3: Calculate the enthalpy change
The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol of H⁺} \).  
Enthalpy change = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

### Step 4: Convert to kcal (if necessary)
Since \( 1 \, \text{kJ} \approx 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \),  
\[
-11.4 \, \text{kJ} \approx -11.4 \times 0.239 \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
- **Option A:** \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) matches the calculated value.  
- **Option B:** \( -11.42 \, \text{kcal} \) is inconsistent with the calculation.  
- **Option C:** \( -3.80 \, \text{kcal} \) is incorrect.  
- **Option D:** \( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \) is inconsistent with the calculation.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.
