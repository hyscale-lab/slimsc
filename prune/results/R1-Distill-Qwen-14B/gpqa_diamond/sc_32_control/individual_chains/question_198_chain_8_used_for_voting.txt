Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes. Hmm, let me think. The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. I remember that stability constants, β, are involved here. Stability constants tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form.

So, the given data is: Co(II) concentration is 1e-2 M, and SCN- is 0.1 M. The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, wait, stability constants usually increase with the order of complexes. Oh, but wait, the β4 here is 16, which is lower than β3. So maybe the complexes are Co(SCN)n^2−n where n is 1 to 4? Or maybe I'm getting the order wrong.

Wait, the problem refers to dithiocyanato complexes, which have two SCN- ligands. So I'm looking for the species that is Co(SCN)₂^2- perhaps. But wait, the stability constants are for each level, like β1 is for the first complex, which would be Co(SCN)^+ maybe? Because each β is for adding another SCN-.

Let me think. The general approach for these kinds of problems is to calculate the fraction of each complex species present. The fraction is given by the product of the stability constant and the ratio of the ligand concentrations. But since the ligand concentration is high (SCN- is 0.1 M), the higher complexes are favored.

The formula for the fraction of each complex is: f_n = (β_n / β_total) * ( [SCN^-]^{n} ) / (1 + [SCN^-] + β1[SCN^-]^2 + β1β2[SCN^-]^3 + β1β2β3[SCN^-]^4 ) )? Or maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, for each step, the fraction is (β_n / K_total), but perhaps I should approach it step by step.

Wait, another approach: The fraction of each complex can be found using the stepwise formation constants. For each n, the fraction f_n is (β1β2...βn / (1 + β1[SCN] + β1β2[SCN]^2 + β1β2β3[SCN]^3 + ... )) multiplied by [SCN]^n.

Wait, no. I think the general formula for the fraction of the complex with n ligands is:

f_n = (β_1 β_2 ... β_n [SCN]^-n ) / (1 + β_1 [SCN]^-1 + β_1 β_2 [SCN]^-2 + ... + β_1 β_2 β_3 β_4 [SCN]^-4 )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

The formation of complexes happens step by step. The first complex is Co(SCN), the second is Co(SCN)₂, and so on. The stability constants are given as β1, β2, β3, β4, which I think are the stepwise constants. So β1 is the constant for Co²+ + SCN^- → CoSCN^+, β2 is CoSCN^+ + SCN^- → Co(SCN)₂^2-? Wait, no, because each step adds another SCN^-.

Wait, the stepwise formation constants would be:

β1 = [CoSCN^+]/([Co²+][SCN^-])

β2 = [Co(SCN)₂^2−]/([CoSCN^+][SCN^-])

β3 = [Co(SCN)₃^3−]/([Co(SCN)₂^2-][SCN^-])

β4 = [Co(SCN)₄^4−]/([Co(SCN)₃^3-][SCN^-])

So the overall stability constant for the fourth complex is β_total = β1*β2*β3*β4.

So each βn is the constant for the nth step.

The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is Co(SCN)₂^2-. So that's the n=2 complex.

To find the fraction f2, I can use the formula:

f2 = (β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2) / ( [SCN^-]^4 β1 β2 β3 β4 + [SCN^-]^3 β1 β2 β3 + [SCN^-]^2 β1 β2 + [SCN^-] β1 + 1 )

Wait, no. Let me think of the denominator as the sum of all possible complexes plus the free ion.

The general formula is:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n ) / ( [SCN^-]^4 (β1 β2 β3 β4) + [SCN^-]^3 (β1 β2 β3) + [SCN^-]^2 (β1 β2) + [SCN^-] (β1) + 1 )

Wait, let me think: The denominator is the sum of the terms for all possible species. Each term is the product of the β's up to that point multiplied by [SCN^-]^n. For the first term, n=0: 1. For n=1: β1 [SCN^-]¹. For n=2: β1 β2 [SCN^-]². For n=3: β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]³. And for n=4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]⁴.

Wait, but actually, the denominator is the sum of all the terms, each representing the contribution of each complex. So the denominator is:

Denominator = 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4

Hmm, but wait, each term is for a different complex. The first term (1) is for Co²+ (free ion). The second term is β1 [SCN] for CoSCN^+.

Wait, no. Wait, the first term is 1, which is Co²+.

The second term is β1 [SCN^-], which is the concentration of CoSCN^+.

The third term is β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2, which is the concentration of Co(SCN)₂^2−.

Similarly, the next term is β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3, and the last term is β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4.

Wait, but that can't be right because each complex's concentration is given by the product of the previous β multiplied by [SCN^-]. So:

[Co²+] = 1 (in terms of the fraction)

[CoSCN^+] = β1 [SCN^-] [Co²+]

[Co(SCN)₂^2−] = β2 [SCN^-] [CoSCN^+]

= β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 [Co²+]

Similarly, [Co(SCN)₃^3−] = β3 [SCN^-] [Co(SCN)₂^2−] = β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 [Co²+]

And [Co(SCN)₄^4−] = β4 [SCN^-] [Co(SCN)₃^3−] = β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4 [Co²+]

So the denominator is 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4.

So the fraction f_n for each complex is [complex] / ([Co²+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)₂^2−] + [Co(SCN)₃^3−] + [Co(SCN)₄^4−]).

But since [Co²+] is 1 (in terms of the fraction), each term is as follows.

So, the fraction f2 is (β1 β2 [SCN]^2) / denominator.

So plugging the numbers in:

β1 =9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

[SCN^-] =0.1 M.

So compute each term in the denominator:

Term0 (Co²+): 1

Term1 (CoSCN^+): β1 [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term2 (Co(SCN)₂^2−): β1 β2 [SCN]^2 =9*40*(0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6

Term3 (Co(SCN)₃^3−): β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 =9*40*63*(0.1)^3 = 22680 * 0.001= 2.268

Term4 (Co(SCN)₄^4−): β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 =9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4

Let's compute that:

9 *40 = 360; 360 *63=22680; 22680 *16= 362,880

Multiply by (0.1)^4 = 1e-4: 362880 * 1e-4 = 36.288.

So the denominator is 1 + 0.9 +3.6 + 2.268 +36.288.

Let me sum them up step by step:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +2.268=7.768

7.768 +36.288=44.056.

So denominator is 44.056.

Now, the numerator for f2 is Term2, which is 3.6.

So f2 = 3.6 / 44.056 ≈ ?

Let me calculate that: 3.6 /44.056 ≈ 0.0817, which is approximately 8.17%.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is Co(SCN)₂^2−. So that's correct.

But looking at the options, the choices are 42.3%, 25.6%, 38.1%, and 16.9%. Hmm, none of these are near 8%. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I got the order of the stability constants wrong. Because the problem states β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, β4 is 16, which is lower than β3. So that would mean that the fourth complex is less stable than the third, which is possible. But wait, when I calculated the denominator, I included all four terms, including the fourth complex.

Wait, but let's double-check the calculation of the terms.

Term1: β1 [SCN] =9 * 0.1=0.9

Term2: β1 β2 [SCN]^2 = 9*40*(0.1)^2 = 360 *0.01=3.6

Term3: β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 =9*40*63*(0.1)^3 = (9*40=360) *63=22680 *0.001=22.68? Wait wait, earlier I thought 9*40=360, 360 *63=22680, then 22680*(0.1^3) =22680 *0.001=22.68? Wait, earlier I said term3 was 2.268, but that's incorrect. Wait, 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680 * (0.1)^3 = 22680 * 0.001=22.68. Oh, I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 2.268. So that's term3.

Term4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 =9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4. Let me compute this:

9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680 *16= 362,880. [SCN]^4 is 0.1^4=1e-4=0.0001. So 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So the terms are:

Term0:1

Term1:0.9

Term2:3.6

Term3:22.68

Term4:36.288

Adding them all together:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9+3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468

So denominator is 64.468.

Term2 is 3.6.

So f2=3.6 /64.468 ≈ approximately 0.05556 or 5.56%. Still not matching any options. Hmm, this is a problem.

Wait, perhaps the β values are given in a different order. Maybe β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc., but perhaps the order is different. Alternatively, perhaps the β values are cumulative. Like, β1 is for CoSCN^+, β2 is for Co(SCN)₂^2−, and so on. Wait, no, the βn is the stepwise constant for the nth step.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the overall fraction correctly.

Wait, another approach: the fraction of each species can be calculated using the formula for each step. Alternatively, the fraction of each complex is given by (β1β2...βn [SCN]^n) divided by the sum of all such terms.

So in this case, the dithiocyanato complex is n=2, so f2 = (β1β2 [SCN]^2) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4 )

Plugging in the numbers:

[SCN]=0.1, β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Compute each part:

Numerator: β1β2 [SCN]^2 =9 *40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 *0.01=3.6.

Denominator:

1 + (9*0.1) + (9*40 *0.1^2) + (9*40*63 *0.1^3) + (9*40*63*16 *0.1^4 )

Compute each term:

1: 1

Term1:9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2:9*40 *0.01=3.6.

Term3:9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term4:9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362880, 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So denominator is 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288= ?

Adding them up:

1+0.9=1.9

1.9+3.6=5.5

5.5+22.68=28.18

28.18+36.288=64.468.

So f2=3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05556, which is about 5.56%. So the percentage is approximately 5.56%, which isn't any of the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the β4 is 16, which is lower than β3=63. So the fourth complex is less stable than the third. That might mean that the third complex is more prevalent than the fourth. But in our calculation, the fourth term is 36.288, which is the largest. Hmm, that suggests that the fourth complex is dominant. But in the question, we're looking for the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So perhaps the correct answer is about 5.5%, but that's not an option.

Wait, the options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%. So my calculation doesn't match any. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Alternative approach: Maybe the question refers to the blue complex as Co(SCN)₂^2−, but perhaps the β values are such that the fraction is for that complex.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in computing one of the terms.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formation constants are given as the overall constants, not the stepwise. Wait, that's a possibility. Because sometimes, βn can be the overall constant for the nth complex.

Wait, for example, β1 is the constant for the first complex (n=1), β2 for n=2, etc.

In that case, the overall β for the nth complex is the product of the stepwise constants. So to get the fraction, each fraction f_n is (β_n [SCN]^-n ) / (sum from m=0 to 4 of β_m [SCN]^-m )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the overall stability constant for the nth complex is the product of β1 to βn.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the fraction for each complex based on the overall β.

Wait, the overall β for each complex is:

β1 =9 (for CoSCN^+)

β2 =9*40=360 (for Co(SCN)₂^2−)

β3=9*40*63=22680 (for Co(SCN)₃^3−)

β4=9*40*63*16=362880 (for Co(SCN)₄^4−)

Wait, but if β1 is the overall constant for the first complex (n=1), then the fraction f_n is (β_n [SCN^-]^n ) / (1 + β1 [SCN^-]^1 + β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

So let me try that.

So:

f2 = (β2 [SCN]^2) / (1 + β1 [SCN]^1 + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Plugging in the numbers:

β1=9, β2=360, β3=22680, β4=362880.

[SCN]=0.1.

Compute each term:

Term0:1.

Term1: β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2:360*(0.1)^2=360*0.01=3.6.

Term3:22680*(0.1)^3=22680*0.001=22.68.

Term4:362880*(0.1)^4=362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

Sum all terms: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So denominator is 64.468.

f2 = 3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05556, which is 5.556%, same as before.

Hmm, same result. So I'm back to square one. None of the options match. So I must have made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the dithiocyanato complex as the third one, but that doesn't make sense because dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ligands. Or perhaps the stability constants are given in a different way.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, the stability constant for a complex is given as the logarithm, but in this problem, the β are given as numbers, not logs.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should consider the total concentration of Co and SCN.

Wait, but the problem states that the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. So the [SCN] is fixed, but in a real scenario, the ligand concentration is high, so more complexes form.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the terms. Let me recompute each term:

Term0:1.

Term1: β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2: β1 β2 [SCN]^2=9*40 * (0.1^2)=360 *0.01=3.6.

Term3: β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3= 22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4=9*40*63 *16 *(0.1^4)= 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362880. 362880 * (0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum is 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So denominator is 64.468.

So f2=3.6/64.468≈5.56%.

Wait, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe the question is about the blue complex being the first one. Or perhaps I'm missing a factor. Alternatively, perhaps the question counts all complexes with two or more SCN- as "dithiocyanato," but no, the term "dithiocyanato" implies exactly two.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the formation is considering the charge. Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should calculate the fraction of the Co(SCN)₂^2− complex, but the solution includes the other complexes, and maybe the fraction isn't just f2, but perhaps more.

Wait, another approach: the solution considers the total concentration of Co, which is 1e-2 M. The presence of SCN affects the distribution of Co between the complexes.

Wait, but the fraction calculation already considers that. Because the denominator includes all species, so the sum is the total concentration.

Wait, maybe I should consider the total concentration, but no, the fractions are already based on the total.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the stability constants. Let me think again about the order of the β.

Wait, perhaps the β values are in the order of the complexes, where β1 is for the first complex (n=1), β2 for n=2, etc. So the overall β for each species is the product up to that step.

So, for the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), the fraction is (β1 β2 [SCN]^2) / (denominator).

Which is what I did, but that gives 5.56%, which isn't in the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem refers to the reverse: maybe the β values are given in the order of the overall constants, not the stepwise. For example, β1 is the overall for the first complex, β2 overall for the second, etc. That is, β1 is 9 (for CoSCN^+), β2 is 40 (for Co(SCN)₂^2−), β3 is 63 (for Co(SCN)₃^3−), β4 is 16 (for Co(SCN)₄^4−).

In that case, the fraction for n=2 would be (β2 [SCN]^2) / (sum of βm [SCN]^m for m=0 to 4).

Wait, but β0 would be 1, since [Co²+] is the free ion.

So denominator is 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

Plugging in the numbers:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

[SCN]=0.1.

Compute each term:

1: 1

Term1:9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2:40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

Term3:63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

Term4:16*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Sum these terms:1 +0.9=1.9 +0.4=2.3 +0.063=2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

Numerator for f2 is 0.4.

So f2=0.4 /2.3646 ≈0.169, or 16.9%.

Ah, that's option D. So perhaps this is the correct approach.

But wait, why would the problem give β in this way? I thought βn are stepwise constants. But perhaps in this problem, the β values are the overall constants for each complex.

In that case, the fractions would be calculated as:

f_n = (β_n [SCN^-]^n ) / (sum from m=0 to 4 β_m [SCN^-]^m )

But wait, for the free ion, m=0, so β0=1.

But let me verify:

In this approach, each βn is the overall stability constant for the nth complex.

So for n=1, β1=9 → [CoSCN^+]/([Co²+][SCN^-])=9.

Which can be rearranged as [CoSCN^+]=9 [Co²+][SCN^-].

Similarly, [Co(SCN)₂^2−] = β2 [Co²+][SCN^-]^2 =40 [Co²+](0.1)^2.

So, when calculating the fractions, each species is [complex] = βn [Co²+][SCN^-]^n.

So the total concentration of Co is:

[Co²+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)₂^2−] + [Co(SCN)₃^3−] + [Co(SCN)₄^4−] = [Co²+] (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

So the fraction f2 is:

([Co(SCN)₂^2−] ) / [Co_total] = (β2 [SCN]^2 ) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Which is what I did earlier, leading to 0.4 /2.3646= approx 16.9%, which matches option D.

But why would the question provide β as stepwise or overall? Because the standard is that βn are stepwise, but perhaps in this problem, they're given as overall.

Wait, the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Usually, stepwise βs are for each addition, but if they are given as overall, then the formula changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the βs are cumulative. Let me think.

If β1 is the overall for n=1, β2 for n=2, etc., then the fraction is as calculated earlier (16.9%), which is option D.

But how can I be sure? The problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16."

Stability constants are typically overall, not stepwise. Hmm, no, wait. No, usually, the stability constant (formation constant) is given as the overall for the complex. So for the first complex, the stability constant is β1=9, meaning that [CoSCN^+]/([Co²+][SCN^-])=9.

Similarly, β2=40 would be [Co(SCN)₂^2−]/([Co²+][SCN^-]^2 )=40.

But wait, that's not correct because the formation constants are stepwise. Wait, no. The overall formation constant for Co(SCN)₂^2− is the product of the stepwise β1 and β2.

So, the overall β for the second complex is β1 * β2 =9 *40=360.

But in the problem, β2 is 40, which suggests that it's the stepwise constant.

So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the βn as stepwise, leading to the 5.56% result, but that's not an option. So I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the given β as overall constants, leading to 16.9%, which is option D.

But given that, the correct answer would be D)16.9%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)₂²⁻, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants provided: β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16. The task involves calculating the fraction of the Co(SCN)₂²⁻ complex relative to all possible cobalt species.

### Key Assumptions and Approach:
1. **Stability Constants**: The stability constants (β) are interpreted as overall constants for each complex. This means:
   - β₁ = 9 corresponds to CoSCN⁺.
   - β₂ = 40 corresponds to Co(SCN)₂²⁻.
   - β₃ = 63 corresponds to Co(SCN)₃³⁻.
   - β₄ = 16 corresponds to Co(SCN)₄⁴⁻.

2. **Fraction Formula**: The fraction of a species is given by:
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^{4} \beta_m [\text{SCN}^-]^m}
   \]
   where \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \), and \( \beta_0 = 1 \) (for the free ion Co²⁺).

3. **Denominator Calculation**: The denominator is the sum of contributions from all cobalt species:
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4
   \]

4. **Numerator Calculation**: For the dithiocyanato complex (n = 2), the numerator is:
   \[
   \text{Numerator} = \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2
   \]

### Calculations:
1. **Denominator Terms**:
   - \( \beta_0 = 1 \)
   - \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \times 0.1 = 0.9 \)
   - \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \times (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \)
   - \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \times (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \)
   - \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \times (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \)

   Summing these:
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

2. **Numerator**:
   \[
   \text{Numerator} = 0.4
   \]

3. **Fraction of Co(SCN)₂²⁻**:
   \[
