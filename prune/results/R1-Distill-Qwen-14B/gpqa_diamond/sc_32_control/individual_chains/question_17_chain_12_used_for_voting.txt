Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is that chelating agent, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. It binds metal ions like calcium pretty tightly.

The problem gives me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. Wait, what's the formation constant again? Oh right, the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex ion. So in this case, it's the constant for the reaction where Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- form the Ca-EDTA complex.

The question asks for the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. Well, if the Ca-EDTA complex is present at 0.02 M, and assuming that the solution is ideal with the right pH and temperature, I think the key is to use the Kf expression.

So, the reaction would be something like Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The Kf for this reaction is given as 5e10. But wait, sometimes the formation constant is written as [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Exactly, that's right.

But wait, in a solution where we have the complex, we can assume that the majority of the calcium is bound by EDTA. So the concentration of free calcium ions should be really low because the Kf is so large (1e10 is big, but 5e10 is even bigger, so the complex is very stable).

So, the total concentration of Ca is in the complex. The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So, the total calcium concentration is 0.02 M because each complex has one Ca^2+.

Wait, but the question is about the free calcium ions, not the total. Oh wait, no, the question says the concentration of calcium ions. Hmm, wait, but if the complex is 0.02 M, and the complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-, then the free calcium concentration would be the [Ca^2+].

So, assuming that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and that the dissociation is minimal (because Kf is large), we can set up an equation.

Let me think: The formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). 

Let me denote the concentration of Ca^2+ as x. Since the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming that the EDTA is in excess or something? Wait, no. Wait, in this problem, I think all the Ca is in the complex. Because if we have 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, and assuming that the solution is such that the complex is fully formed, then the free Ca^2+ is x, and the EDTA^4- is also x, because for each Ca^2+ that dissociates, an EDTA^4- would be released.

Wait, but wait, the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, initially, before dissociation, [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M, and [Ca^2+] and [EDTA^4-] are zero. But that can't be right because they would start to dissociate. So, in reality, the complex dissociates a little, so that [Ca^2+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02 - x.

But since Kf is so large (5e10), the dissociation x would be very small compared to 0.02. So, we can approximate [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02 M, and x is much smaller. So the equation becomes Kf ≈ (0.02)/(x^2) = 5e10.

So solving for x: x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) → x^2 = 2e-3 /5e10 → wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → x^2 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, no. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, 4e-13 is (2e-6.5)^2? Let me compute sqrt(4e-13).

4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7, approximately. So sqrt(4e-13) = 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7.

Oh, so x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7 M. That must be the answer.

Wait, but let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. The Kf is 5e10, which is very large, so the dissociation is minimal. So, the assumption is [Ca^2+] = [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02.

So, Kf = (0.02)/(x^2) =5e10 → x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) → Let me compute that again more accurately.

0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, so 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which matches option C.

I don't see any mistakes in this calculation. The answer should be option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{f}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The equilibrium expression for the formation constant is:

\[
K_{\text{f}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) be \(x\). Since the dissociation of the complex is minimal (due to the large \(K_{\text{f}}\)), the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) remains approximately 0.02 M. Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{f}} \approx \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{f}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

Simplify:

\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which matches option C.
