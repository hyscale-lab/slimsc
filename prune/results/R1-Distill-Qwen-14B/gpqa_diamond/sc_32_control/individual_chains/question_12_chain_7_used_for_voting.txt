Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me read it again.

The question says: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the products.

Wait, the problem is about particle physics, specifically a pion decay. I remember that pions can decay into other particles, and since the pion is at rest, the decay products must have some kinetic energy.

So, the reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. But wait, in reality, pions decay into a muon and a neutrino. But I'm not sure if the neutrino's mass is considered here. Oh right, neutrinos are considered massless in many problems unless stated otherwise, so I'll treat it as having zero rest mass.

Since the pion is at rest initially, the total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. So, p_mu = -p_nu. But because the neutrino is massless, its energy is entirely kinetic (since E = pc for massless particles). 

The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion: E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon has rest mass, so its energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). The neutrino's energy is E_nu = p_nu c. But since p_mu = p_nu in magnitude, E_nu = p_mu c.

So, E_total_after = E_mu + E_nu = sqrt( p_mu² c^4 + m_mu² c^4 ) + p_mu c.

Since energy is conserved, E_initial = E_total_after.

So, 139.6 MeV = sqrt( p_mu² c^4 + (105.7 MeV)^2 ) + p_mu c.

Hmm, but this equation looks a bit complex. Maybe I can set x = p_mu c, then the equation becomes:

139.6 = sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2 ) + x.

Let me write it as:

139.6 - x = sqrt(x² + 105.7^2 )

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(139.6 - x)^2 = x² + (105.7)^2.

Expanding the left side:

139.6² - 2*139.6 x + x² = x² + 105.7².

Simplify. The x² terms cancel out:

139.6² - 2*139.6 x = 105.7².

Calculate the squares:

139.6^2 = let's see, 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6 is about 19488.16. Wait, better compute accurately.

139.6 * 139.6 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

105.7^2 is 11172.49.

So,

19488.16 - 2*139.6 x = 11172.49.

Subtract 11172.49 from both sides:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 2*139.6 x.

Calculate 19488.16 - 11172.49. Let's see: 19488.16 - 11172 = 8316.16, then subtract 0.49, so 8315.67.

So,

8315.67 = 2*139.6 x.

2*139.6 is 279.2.

So,

x = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that. 279.2 * 29.7 is roughly... Let's see: 279.2 *30=8376, which is a bit higher than 8315. So maybe around 29.7?

Wait, better compute accurately:

279.2 * x = 8315.67.

x ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 * 30 =8376, which is larger. So 30 would give 8376, but I have 8315.67, which is 60.33 less than 8376.

So 30 - (60.33/279.2) ≈ 30 - 0.216 ≈ 29.784.

So x ≈ 29.784 MeV.

Wait, but x is p_mu c. So p_mu c is approximately 29.784 MeV.

Now, the energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + its kinetic energy. Wait, no, E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is its rest mass energy plus kinetic energy.

Wait, no, E_mu is the total energy, which includes rest mass and kinetic energy. So K_mu = E_mu - m_mu c².

Wait, E_mu is sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ), which is 105.7^2 + (29.784)^2 under the square root.

So sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.784 squared: approximately (30)^2 =900, but 29.784 is about 0.216 less, so (30 - 0.216)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.216 + (0.216)^2 ≈ 900 - 12.96 + 0.0466 ≈ 887.0866.

So adding 105.7^2=11172.49:

Total under sqrt: 887.0866 +11172.49 = 12059.5766.

Square root of 12059.5766: let me see, sqrt(12059.5766). Let's think about 110^2=12100, which is just a bit higher. So sqrt(12059.5766) is approximately 109.8.

Wait, more accurately: 109.8^2 = (110 - 0.2)^2 = 12100 - 2*110*0.2 + 0.04 = 12100 -44 + 0.04 = 12056.04.

Hmm, but 12059.5766 is a bit higher. The difference is 12059.5766 - 12056.04 = 3.5366.

So roughly, 109.8 + (3.5366)/(2*109.8) ≈ 109.8 + 3.5366/219.6 ≈ 109.8 + 0.0161 ≈ 109.816 MeV.

Wait, but that can't be right because E_mu is the total energy, which would be about 109.8 MeV, but m_mu is 105.7 MeV, so the kinetic energy would be about 4.1 MeV.

But let me compute more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can find it without approximating so much.

Wait, maybe I should compute E_mu more accurately.

E_mu = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.784 squared:

29.784 * 29.784: let's compute 29 *29 is 841. 29 * 0.784 = 22.736. 0.784 *29= same. 0.784^2 = 0.614656.

Wait, perhaps better to compute step by step.

29.784^2 = (30 - 0.216)^2 = 30^2 - 2*30*0.216 + 0.216^2 = 900 - 12.96 + 0.046656 = 887.086656.

So E_mu = sqrt(887.086656 + (105.7)^2 )

105.7^2 = let's compute 105^2=11025. 0.7^2=0.49. 2*105*0.7=147. So (105+0.7)^2=105^2 + 2*105*0.7 +0.7^2=11025 +147 + 0.49=11172.49.

So adding 887.086656 and 11172.49 gives 12059.576656.

So sqrt(12059.576656) is the same as E_mu. Let's compute this.

We know that 109.8^2 = 12056.04 as calculated earlier. The difference is 12059.576656 - 12056.04 = 3.536656.

To find the square root, we can use linear approximation.

Let me consider f(x) = sqrt(x) at x = 12056.04, which is (109.8)^2. The derivative f'(x) is 1/(2*sqrt(x)).

So delta_x = 3.536656.

delta_f ≈ f'(x) * delta_x = (1/(2*109.8)) * 3.536656 ≈ (0.0045525) *3.536656 ≈ 0.01608.

So sqrt(12059.576656) ≈ 109.8 + 0.01608 ≈ 109.816 MeV.

So E_mu ≈ 109.816 MeV.

The muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy K_mu is E_mu - m_mu c² = 109.816 - 105.7 = approx 4.116 MeV.

Wait, that's about 4.12 MeV. Looking at the options, option D says 4.12 MeV for the muon. But wait, let me check the neutrino's kinetic energy.

The neutrino's energy is p_mu c, which we found earlier as x ≈29.784 MeV. Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy, so K_nu = 29.784 MeV.

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.78 MeV. Looking at the options, option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Because I made some approximations, maybe I should do a more accurate calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate x exactly. Let's go back to the equation:

139.6 - x = sqrt(x² + 105.7² )

Let me square both sides again:

(139.6 - x)^2 = x² + (105.7)^2.

139.6² - 2*139.6 x + x² = x² + 105.7².

Subtract x²:

139.6² - 2*139.6 x = 105.7².

Then, 2*139.6 x = 139.6² - 105.7².

Compute 139.6²: as before, 19488.16.

105.7^2 = 11172.49.

So 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

So 2*139.6 x =8315.67 → x=8315.67/(2*139.6)=8315.67/279.2.

Compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 * 29.784.

Wait, let me do exact division: 8315.67 / 279.2.

Hmm, alternatively, compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Let me approximate:

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 * 30 =8376 minus 279.2 → 8376-279.2= 8096.8.

Wait, 279.2 *29=279.2*(30-1)=8376-279.2=8096.8.

But I have 8315.67, which is higher than 8096.8.

So 29 gives 8096.8, which is 8315.67-8096.8=218.87 less.

So 218.87 /279.2 ≈ 0.782.

So x ≈29.782 MeV.

Wait, so x ≈29.78 MeV.

So E_nu = x =29.78 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt(x² + m_mu²) = sqrt(29.78^2 +105.7^2).

Compute 29.78^2: (30 -0.22)^2=900 -2*30*0.22 +0.0484=900 -13.2 +0.0484=886.8484.

Add 105.7^2=11172.49→ 886.8484+11172.49=12059.3384.

sqrt(12059.3384)= let's compute.

109^2=11881, 110^2=12100.

12059.3384 is between 109^2 and 110^2.

Compute 109.8^2=109.8 *109.8.

Compute:

109.8 * 100=10980.

109.8 *9=988.2.

109.8 *0.8=87.84.

Wait, no, better compute 109.8 * 109.8.

Break it down:

= (110 - 0.2) * (110 -0.2)

= 110^2 - 2*110*0.2 + 0.2^2

= 12100 -44 +0.04=12056.04.

So 109.8^2=12056.04.

Compare to 12059.3384. The difference is 3.2984.

So, to find how much more beyond 109.8 is needed, let's compute:

Let f(x) = x^2, and we know f(109.8) =12056.04.

We need f(a) =12059.3384.

a ≈ 109.8 + delta.

f(a) ≈ f(109.8) + f’(109.8)*delta.

f’(x)=2x → f’(109.8)=219.6.

So,

12059.3384 ≈ 12056.04 + 219.6 * delta.

delta≈ (12059.3384 -12056.04)/219.6 ≈ (3.2984)/219.6 ≈0.01503.

So a≈109.8 +0.01503≈109.815 MeV.

So E_mu≈109.815 MeV.

So K_mu= E_mu - m_mu =109.815 -105.7=4.115 MeV≈4.12 MeV.

E_nu=29.78 MeV.

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

That's very close. So the answer should be option D.

To determine the kinetic energies of the decay products in the reaction:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, and the rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\), we proceed as follows:

### Conservation of Energy and Momentum
1. **Initial Energy**: The total initial energy is the rest energy of the pion:
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Final Energy**: After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (\(\mu^+\)) and the neutrino (\(\nu\)):
   \[
   E_{\text{final}} = E_{\mu^+} + E_{\nu}.
   \]
   The muon's total energy is:
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{(p_{\mu^+} c)^2 + (m_{\mu^+} c^2)^2},
   \]
   where \(p_{\mu^+}\) is the momentum of the muon. The neutrino's energy is entirely kinetic since it is massless:
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} c = p_{\mu^+} c.
   \]

3. **Conservation of Momentum**: Since the pion is initially at rest, the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = p_{\nu}.
   \]

### Solving for Momentum
Using energy conservation:
\[
m_{\pi^+} c^2 = \sqrt{(p_{\mu^+} c)^2 + (m_{\mu^+} c^2)^2} + p_{\mu^+} c.
\]
Let \(x = p_{\mu^+} c\). Substituting:
\[
139.6 = \sqrt{x^2 + 105.7^2} + x.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
139.6 - x = \sqrt{x^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
(139.6 - x)^2 = x^2 + 105.7^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
139.6^2 - 2(139.6)x = 105.7^2.
\]
Substituting \(139.6^2 = 19488.16\) and \(105.7^2 = 11172.49\):
\[
19488.16 - 2(139.6)x = 11172.49.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
8315.67 = 2(139.6)x.
\]
Solving for \(x\):
\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energies
1. **Neutrino's Kinetic Energy**: Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy equals its kinetic energy:
   \[
   K_{\nu} = E_{\nu} = x = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Muon's Kinetic Energy**: The muon's total energy is:
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{x^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
   \]
   Substituting \(x \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\):
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2}.
   \]
   Compute \(29.78^2 = 886.8484\) and \(105.7^2 = 11172.49\):
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{886.8484 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.3384} \approx 109.816 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   The muon's kinetic energy is:
   \[
   K_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.816 - 105.7 \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV**

Answer: D
