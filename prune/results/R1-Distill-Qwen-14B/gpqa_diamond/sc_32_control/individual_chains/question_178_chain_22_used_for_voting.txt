Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and its renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which is the commutator of the gamma matrices. 

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should check the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. Since the Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions (because the action is dimensionless, and it's integrated over four dimensions), each term in it must have dimension 4.

So, let's break down the term: κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

I know that the fermion field ψ has a mass dimension of 3/2. Because for a Dirac spinor, [ψ]_M = 3/2. So ψ̄, which is the adjoint, has the same dimension as ψ, so [ψ̄]_M is also 3/2.

What about σ_{μν}? Since it's a commutator of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless (I think), σ_{μν} itself should be dimensionless. Oh wait, right, because gamma matrices are matrices, not fields, so they don't carry mass dimension. So [σ_{μν}]_M = 0.

Next, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor of the electromagnetic field. Wait, F is a field tensor, right? So for a gauge field like the photon, the field A has dimension 1. The field strength F is the derivative of A, so the dimension is 2. Because each derivative is dimension 1, so F_{μν} = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, so [F]_M = [∂ A]_M = 1 + 1 = 2.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The gauge field A has dimension 1. Because the Lagrangian term for kinetic energy is (1/4) F^2, which must have dimension 4. So F^2 has dimension 4, so F has dimension 2. Because each F is dimension 2, so F squared is 4. Right, that makes sense.

So now, putting it all together. The term is ψ̄ σ ψ F. So each part's dimension:

ψ̄: 3/2
σ: 0
ψ: 3/2
F: 2.

Multiplying these together: (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = (3) + 2 = 5.

So the entire term L_int = κ [ψ̄ σ ψ F] has dimension [κ] + 5 = 4, because the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So solving for [κ]: 4 = [κ] +5 → [κ] = 4 -5 = -1.

Wait, that's a negative dimension? I'm a bit surprised, but I think that's correct. Because the coupling constant in an interaction term can sometimes have negative mass dimension, especially in higher-order terms like in Fermi's theory of the four-fermion interaction. Fermi's coupling had a negative dimension, which made the theory non-renormalizable.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable? Renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling. For a theory to be renormalizable, all couplings must have mass dimension less than or equal to 4 - (sum of the fields in the term)/2. Wait, actually, in a renormalizable interaction, the dimension of the coupling constant must be greater than or equal to zero, because higher dimension operators (in terms of mass) would require higher-order terms that can't be handled with a finite number of vertices in perturbation theory. 

Wait, another approach: For a term in the Lagrangian to be renormalizable, the dimension of the coupling must satisfy [coupling] ≥ 0. Because if the coupling has a negative mass dimension, the term is superrenormalizable or non-renormalizable? Hmm, wait, wait.

Wait, the general rule is that the interaction term is renormalizable if the coupling has a dimension less than or equal to 4. Or more precisely, the dimension of the coupling should be [g] = d - (sum of the fields' dimensions)/2. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think in terms of the superficial degree of divergence.

The superficial degree of divergence for a Feynman diagram is given by D = 4 - (L * [Lagrangian dimension per vertex] ). Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Alternatively, the superficial degree of divergence is D = 4 - (1/2) (sum of the external legs) ) + (number of loops). Wait, maybe I should recall the formula correctly.

Wait, the superficial degree of divergence formula is D = d - (I (d -2)) where d is spacetime dimension, but I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again: For a scalar theory, the degree of divergence is D = 4 - (L * (each vertex has a certain dimension)).

Wait, perhaps a better approach. The mass dimension [L] =4. So each term in the Lagrangian has dimension 4. The interaction term is written as g φ^k, where g is the coupling. For this to be renormalizable, the dimension of g must be ≥ 0. Because if g has a negative dimension, each vertex contributes a term that is dimensionful, leading to higher divergences.

Wait, but in our case, the interaction term is L = κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. So the dimension of this term is [κ] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [σ] + [F] = [κ] + 3/2 + 3/2 + 0 + 2 = [κ] + 5 =4 → [κ] = -1.

So [κ] is -1. Now, for the theory to be renormalizable, the coupling must have a dimension ≥0. Because if the coupling has a negative dimension, that means that each vertex in Feynman diagrams contributes a term that grows with the energy scale (since [g] <0 → g has units of [Energy]^|d| ), leading to more divergent diagrams and requiring more counterterms, making the theory non-renormalizable.

Alternatively, another way: the dimension of the coupling is [κ] = [Mass]^d. For renormalizable theories, d must be ≥0, because higher dimension operators (d>0) are allowed, but lower dimension (d<0) are not.

Wait, no, actually, for a renormalizable theory, the coupling can have dimension up to 4. But I think the correct rule is that the interaction term must have a coupling with dimension ≤ 4 - (sum of the fields' dimensions). Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to think in terms of possible counterterms. The renormalizability is determined by whether all divergences can be absorbed into the original parameters of the Lagrangian. If the interaction term has a coupling with negative mass dimension, any loop will generate higher-dimension terms, which can't be absorbed, making the theory non-renormalizable.

So, in our case, [κ] is -1. So the coupling has negative mass dimension. Therefore, the interaction term is of higher order ( dimension 5, since [term] = [κ][ψ]^2 [F] → [ψ]^2 is 3, [F] is 2, so total [term] is 5, which is higher than 4). Wait, no, the term itself has to have dimension 4, so that's why κ is -1.

But for renormalizability, the interaction terms must have each term with dimension ≤4. Wait, no, the interaction term has dimension 4, because it's part of the Lagrangian. But the coupling's dimension affects whether the interactions can lead to divergences that can be absorbed.

Wait, in the case where the coupling has negative mass dimension, each vertex in Feynman diagrams would bring in factors of κ, which has a negative dimension. So each loop would add a factor of (momentum)^something. Let's think about a Feynman diagram contributing to a process. Each vertex would contribute a factor of κ, which is [Mass]^-1. So each loop integral would introduce a factor of [Energy]^4 (in 4D). So for a diagram with V vertices and L loops, the superficial degree of divergence D would be D = 4L - V * [κ dimension].

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused again. Let me try to compute the superficial degree of divergence for Feynman diagrams in this theory.

The formula D = 4 - E*(d/2) + 2I, for each term? No, perhaps I should recall the general formula for the superficial degree of divergence in a theory with different fields and interactions.

Wait, the standard formula is D = 4 - (sum over external legs of their dimension) + (number of loops)* something. Alternatively, the formula is:

D = d - (sum of (external momenta for each line)) )

Wait, I think I'm mixing up some concepts. Let me look for a better approach.

Alternatively, the superficial degree of divergence can be calculated as:

D = d - (sum_{i} (n_i (d_i)) ) + (V (d - 2)) )

Wait, perhaps not. Another way is to use the formula based on the vertices and propagators.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the coupling dimension. For a renormalizable theory, all couplings must have a dimension ≤ (d/2), where d is the spacetime dimension. Wait, no, I think that's for superrenormalizability.

Wait, the rule of thumb: In 4 dimensions, an interaction term with coupling dimension [g] ≥ 0 is renormalizable. If [g] < 0, then the theory is non-renormalizable.

So in this case, [κ] = -1 < 0, so the theory is non-renormalizable.

So putting it all together: The mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.

Looking at the options:

Option C says [κ]_M = -1, theory not renormalizable.

Option D says [κ]_M=1, not renormalizable. That can't be right because our calculation says [κ]=-1.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu] \).

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields and operators
1. The fermion field \( \psi \) has mass dimension \( [\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2} \), so \( [\bar{\psi}]_M = \frac{3}{2} \) as well.
2. The commutator \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is a dimensionless operator, so \( [\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0 \).
3. The field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension \( [F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2 \), as it is derived from the gauge field \( A_\mu \) with \( [A_\mu]_M = 1 \).

### Step 2: Mass dimension of \( \kappa \)
The interaction term \( \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) must have mass dimension 4, as all terms in the Lagrangian must have this dimension. The total dimension of the term is:

\[
[\kappa]_M + [\bar{\psi}]_M + [\psi]_M + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M + [F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 4.
\]

Substituting the known dimensions:

\[
[\kappa]_M + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + 2 = 4.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
[\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. In this case, \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), which is negative. A negative mass dimension implies that the interaction term is of higher order (dimension 5), and the theory requires an infinite number of counterterms to absorb divergences. Therefore, the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Step 4: Evaluating the options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. While \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), the theory is not renormalizable.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is not 1.
- **Option C**: Correct. \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), and the theory is not renormalizable.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is not 1, and the theory is not renormalizable.

### Final Answer:
The mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), and the theory is not renormalizable.
