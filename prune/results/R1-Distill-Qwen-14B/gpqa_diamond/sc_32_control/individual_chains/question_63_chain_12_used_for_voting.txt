Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again and jot down what I know.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and it's supposed to absorb a photon to switch to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

The given data are:
- Mass of atom X (Mx) = 20 amu
- Mass of atom Y (My) = 2 amu
- Bond length (R) = 2 angstroms
- Angular frequency of vibration (w) = 4e14 rad/s

The options are A to D, each with different momentum values.

Alright, so I remember that in quantum mechanics, when a molecule absorbs a photon, it transitions between energy states. For diatomic molecules, especially in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized both for rotation and vibration. 

The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. The molecule can transition to the next higher state, which would be a combination of rotational and vibrational changes. But wait, what's the next state after the fundamental? I think the energy levels are quantized, and the transitions can involve changes in vibrational and rotational quantum numbers.

Wait, but the question says it's switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, I think that means the molecule is moving to the next higher energy state, which is the first excited state. But I need to determine whether that involves a change in vibrational state, a rotational state, or both.

In the rotation-vibration model, the total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. The vibrational energy levels are given by the formula E_v = (v + 1/2) ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number. The rotational energy levels are E_J = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where J is the rotational quantum number, and I is the moment of inertia.

In the fundamental state, the molecule is in the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0), right? So the energy is E_fundamental = (0 + 1/2)ħω + (0(0+1)ħ²)/(2I). 

When it absorbs a photon, it can either increase its vibrational state (v increases) or its rotational state (J increases). But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy—so which transition gives the smallest energy increase? 

The energy difference between vibrational states is larger than that between rotational states. For example, going from v=0 to v=1 would require a photon of higher energy than going from J=0 to J=1. So, the lowest possible energy change would involve a rotational transition, not a vibrational one.

Wait, but wait. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state, but the rotational states are quantized as well. So the next state the molecule can go to is probably the first rotational state (J=1) while remaining in the vibrational ground state (v=0). Because increasing the vibrational state would require more energy than just changing the rotation.

Alternatively, maybe the question is implying that the molecule can go to either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state, but we're looking for the minimum energy required, so the photon's energy should match the smallest possible energy difference.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think is v=0 and J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would be the next available state overall. The next state could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. Which requires less energy?

The energy difference for vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1 is ΔE_vib = ħω. For rotational, the energy difference is from J=0 to J=1, which is E_J=1 - E_J=0. Let's compute that.

I'll need to calculate the energy difference for each case and see which is smaller.

First, the moment of inertia I. I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass. Let's calculate μ.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, I need to convert this to kg because the planck constant is in SI units. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Let me compute that: 1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.017, so 3.017e-27 kg.

Wait, no. Wait, 1.818 * 1.6605 = let me calculate more accurately.

1.818 * 1.6605:
1.8 * 1.6605 = approximately 2.989 (since 1.6605 * 1.8 = 2.989)
0.018 * 1.6605 ≈ 0.0299
So total ≈ 3.0189e-27 kg.

Then, I = μ R². R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

So I = (3.0189e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0189e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.20756e-46 kg m².

Now, the rotational energy levels: E_J = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I).

When J=0: E_0 = 0.
When J=1: E_1 = (2 ħ²)/(2I) = ħ²/(I). 

So the energy difference ΔE_rot = E_1 - E_0 = ħ²/(I).

Similarly, the vibrational energy difference is ΔE_vib = ħω.

We need to find which is smaller: ΔE_rot or ΔE_vib.

Compute ΔE_rot:

ħ = h/(2π) = 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

I = 1.20756e-46 kg m².

So ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I) = 1.112e-68 / 1.20756e-46 ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

Now, ΔE_vib = ħω = 1.0545718e-34 * 4e14 ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

Wait, wait, 4e14 multiplied by 1e-34 is 4e-20, but with the exact value, 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

Hmm, so ΔE_rot is about 9.21e-23 J, and ΔE_vib is 4.218e-20 J. So ΔE_rot is smaller. So the molecule can transition to J=1 with a lower energy photon than transitioning to v=1.

Thus, the photon's energy should match the rotational energy difference.

But wait, wait. The question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be either (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0). Since the energy required for (v=0, J=1) is lower than (v=1, J=0), the molecule would preferentially absorb the photon that allows it to transition to the rotational state.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is v=0 and J=0. The next possible state would be the next highest energy state, which is the one with the smallest energy increment. So, between the two possible transitions (v=1, J=0 and v=0, J=1), which requires less energy? The rotational one, so the photon's energy should match the rotational transition.

Wait, but wait. The energy levels of the molecule are given by E = E_vibrational + E_rotational. So the order of the states would be:

1. v=0, J=0 (lowest energy)
2. v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=0?

Wait, which has lower energy: J=1 with v=0 or v=1 with J=0?

We have to compute which of the two has a lower energy.

Let me compute E for v=0, J=1:

E1 = E_v=0 (which is (1/2)ħω) + E_J=1.

E_J=1 = [1*(1+1) * ħ² ] / (2I) = (2 ħ²)/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

Which we calculated as ~9.21e-23 J.

So E1 = (1/2) ħω + 9.21e-23 J.

E for v=1, J=0:

E2 = E_v=1 + E_J=0.

E_v=1 = (1 + 1/2) ħω = 3/2 ħω.

E_J=0 is zero.

So E2 = 3/2 ħω = (3/2) * 1.05457e-34 * 4e14 ≈ (3/2)*4.218e-20 = 6.327e-20 J.

So E1 is about (0.5 * 4.218e-20) + 9.21e-23 = 2.109e-20 + 0.0921e-20 = 2.201e-20 J.

E2 is 6.327e-20 J. So E1 is lower than E2. Therefore, the next state with the lowest energy is v=0, J=1.

Therefore, the photon must supply the energy difference between v=0, J=0 and v=0, J=1.

Wait no. Because the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next state is the one with the next lowest energy, which is v=0, J=1. So the energy difference is ΔE = E_J=1.

Which is ħ²/(I) ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

So the photon's energy must match this ΔE.

But wait, how does this relate to momentum? Because the photon's energy is E_photon = ΔE. And since the photon's energy is also E_photon = p c, where p is momentum and c is speed of light. So p = E_photon / c.

Wait, but wait. For a photon, E = pc, because for photons, the relation is E = hf = (hc)/λ, and p = E/c.

So if E_photon = ΔE, then p_photon = ΔE / c.

Wait, but wait. Let me confirm that. For a photon, E = pc, so p = E/(c). So yeah, p = ΔE / c.

So I need to compute E_photon = 9.21e-23 J.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So p = (9.21e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but that's way smaller than the given options. The options are in the order of 1e-27 Ns. Hmm, because 1 Ns is 1 kg m/s. So 3.07e-31 kg m/s is 3.07e-31 Ns. That's much smaller than any of the options.

Wait, wait. I must have made a mistake. Let's double-check the calculations.

Wait, maybe I got the approach wrong. Maybe the problem isn't about just rotational transition; perhaps it's about both vibrational and rotational transitions, but the total energy change is the sum of both?

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, and it's going to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The next state would be when either J increases or v increases, whichever requires the least energy.

Wait, let me recalculate the energy differences more accurately.

Compute ΔE_rot:

I = μ R².

μ = (20 * 2)/(20+2) * 1e-27 kg.

Wait wait, no: 20 amu and 2 amu. Let me compute μ correctly.

Mass X (Mx) = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.

Mass Y (My) = 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (3.321e-26 kg * 3.321e-27 kg) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27) kg.

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 kg² ≈ 11.025 * 1e-53 = 1.1025e-52 kg².

Denominator: 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.321e-26 (1 + 0.1) ) = 3.321e-26 * 1.1 = 3.6531e-26 kg.

So μ = (1.1025e-52) / (3.6531e-26) = approximately 3.017e-27 kg.

Wait, that's the same as before. So I = μ R² = 3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

Now, ΔE_rot = ħ²/(2I) ?

Wait, no. Wait the rotational energy levels are E_J = [J (J+1) ħ² ]/(2 I).

So for J=0, E_J=0.

For J=1, E_J = [2 ħ²]/(2 I) = ħ²/(I).

So ΔE_rot = E_J=1 - E_J=0 = ħ²/(I).

Compute ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ΔE_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.2068e-46 ≈ (1.112 / 1.2068) ) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.921 * 1e-22 ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

Earlier calculation correct.

ΔE_rot is 9.21e-23 J.

ΔE_vib = ħ ω = 1.05457e-34 * 4e14 ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

So the rotational transition requires about 9.2e-23 J, which is about 1000 times smaller than vibrational transition (4.2e-20 J).

So the photon's energy must be 9.21e-23 J.

Then p_photon = E_photon / c = 9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s.

Compute that: 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are all around 1e-27 Ns. 3.07e-31 Ns is 3e-4 times smaller than option D (1.4e-28 Ns), but that's way off. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the rotational transition but a vibrational transition. Let me re-read the question.

Question: Switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, could the next state involve an increase in both v and J? No, because the question says 'next state with the lowest possible energy.' So that would be the state with the next lowest energy, which could be either (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0). But which has lower energy?

Wait, let's compute the energies for both possibilities.

E(v=0, J=1) = (1/2)ħω + (2 ħ²)/(2I) = (1/2)ħω + ħ²/(I).

Which is about 2.109e-20 J + 9.21e-23 J ≈ 2.201e-20 J.

E(v=1, J=0) = (3/2)ħω + 0 = (3/2) ħω = (3/2)*4.218e-20 J ≈ 6.327e-20 J.

So E(v=0, J=1) is 2.20e-20 J, which is lower than E(v=1, J=0). So the next state is (v=0, J=1). Therefore, the photon must supply the energy difference between (v=0, J=0) and (v=0, J=1), which is ΔE_rot = 9.21e-23 J.

But that leads to p_photon = 9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options are all way larger. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the model is the rotation-vibration model, which includes both rotational and vibrational energy. So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can change both v and J, but the question is about the minimal energy transition. So perhaps the minimal energy is when the photon's energy corresponds to the first transition possible, which could involve a vibrational change and/or a rotational change.

Alternatively, perhaps the next state is a combination of both.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the selection rules. For diatomic molecules, the selection rules for electric dipole transitions are Δv = ±1 and ΔJ = ±1. But in the context of this problem, the molecule is in its fundamental state (v=0, J=0). To reach the next state, which would be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1, but perhaps the molecule cannot directly transition to J=0 when v=1 because of the selection rules. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the energy difference between the fundamental state and the next state, regardless of quantum numbers.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the next state is the first excited state, which involves a vibrational transition. Because the vibrational energy levels require more energy than rotational, but perhaps the question is looking for the vibrational transition.

Wait, but in that case, the energy would be much higher than the rotational transition. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the molecule transitioning to the next higher energy state, which for the rotation-vibration model is the combination state. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy of the fundamental state and the next state.

Wait, the fundamental state is v=0, J=0.

The energies of the states are:

E(v, J) = E_v + E_J.

E_v = (v + 1/2) ħω.

E_J = [J (J+1) ħ² ]/(2I).

So E(v=0, J=0) = (1/2) ħω + 0 = (1/2) ħω.

What's the next state? The next lowest energy would be the state with the next smallest E. So possible candidates are:

1. v=0, J=1: E = (1/2) ħω + (2 ħ²)/(2I) = (1/2) ħω + ( ħ² )/(I )

2. v=1, J=0: E = (3/2) ħω + 0 = (3/2) ħω.

We compared these before, and (v=0, J=1) has lower energy. So the next state is (v=0, J=1).

So the energy difference is [ (1/2) ħω + ħ²/(I) ] - [ (1/2) ħω ] = ħ²/(I ), which is 9.21e-23 J.

So the photon's energy must be 9.21e-23 J, so p_photon = 9.21e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are close to this. The options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B)2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating ħ²/(I). Let me recheck.

Calculating I again:

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2 ) amu = (40)/(22) = 1.81818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.017e-27 kg.

R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

Now, ħ = 1.05457e-34 J s.

So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ħ² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.2068e-46 = approximately (1e-68 / 1e-46) ) * (1.112 / 1.2068) ) = 1e-22 * 0.921 ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

So that part is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the question is about a vibrational transition. Let me compute the energy for a vibrational transition.

ΔE_vib = ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

So p_photon = 4.218e-20 J / (3e8 m/s) = 1.406e-28 kg m/s = 1.406e-28 Ns.

Which is close to option D: 1.4e-28 N*s.

So why is this different from the rotational transition? Oh, because perhaps the problem is considering the first possible transition, which is the vibrational one, but that would be a much higher energy.

But earlier calculation shows that the rotational transition requires much less energy, so that's the preferred transition. But why is the option D matching the vibrational energy?

Hmm, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. The question says the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, the non-rigid rotor model is an alternative to the rigid rotor model, and it accounts for bond vibrations. Oh, but wait, perhaps the non-rigid rotor is a model that combines rotational and vibrational aspects.

Wait, the non-rigid rotor model allows the bond length to change, which affects the moment of inertia, but in terms of energy levels, it's more complicated. But perhaps for this problem, it's still treated as a rigid rotor with a vibrational energy component.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule undergoes a transition to the next vibrational state (v=1), not considering the rotational state.

But then, the energy of the photon would be 4.218e-20 J, leading to a momentum of 1.406e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But why would the problem say "next state with the lowest possible energy" if the rotational transition is lower? Because the rotational transition would allow a lower energy jump.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the fundamental state as the first vibrational state, but I don't think so. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state, v=0, and the lowest rotational state, J=0.

Wait, maybe the question is about the transition from the fundamental state to the next possible vibrational state, which requires a photon of energy ħω, leading to p_photon= ħω/c.

Wait, let's compute that. ħ= 1.05457e-34 J s, ω=4e14 rad/s.

E_photon = ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

p = E_photon / c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s = 1.406e-28 N s.

Which is option D: 1.4e-28 N*s.

So why is this the case? Because perhaps the problem is referring to the vibrational transition, not the rotational.

Wait, but earlier analysis of the energy levels shows that the (v=0, J=1) state is lower in energy than (v=1, J=0). So why would the photon cause a transition to a higher energy state (v=1, J=0) when a lower energy transition (v=0, J=1) is possible?

Ah, perhaps because when considering allowed transitions (selection rules), only certain transitions are allowed. In the rigid rotor model, the selection rule for rotation is ΔJ = ±1. But for the vibrational transitions, the selection rule is Δv = ±1. However, the combination of these might require the photon to be absorbed in a way that changes both v and J.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is vibrational ground state and rotational ground state (v=0, J=0). The next state would be the first excited state, which could be a vibrational state (v=1, J=0) or a rotational state (v=0, J=1). But according to the energy calculations, the (v=0, J=1) state is lower in energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider the vibrational transition regardless of the rotational state.

But why would the options suggest that the rotational transition is not the answer, and the vibrational is the intended path?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the energy of the (v=0, J=1) state.

Wait, let's re-calculate the energies.

E(v=0, J=0) = (1/2) ħω + 0.

E(v=0, J=1) = (1/2) ħω + [2 ħ²]/(2I) = (1/2) ħω + ( ħ² )/(I )

So the difference is ( ħ² )/(I ) = 9.21e-23 J.

E(v=1, J=0) = (3/2) ħω.

Now, (3/2) ħω = 4.218e-20 * 3/2 = 6.327e-20 J.

So yes, (v=0, J=1) is lower.

Thus, the photon's energy should be 9.21e-23 J, which gives a momentum of 3.07e-31 Ns, but the options don't have this.

Hmm, I'm confused. Maybe the problem is about the vibrational energy, not the rotational. Let me see the options again.

Option D is 1.4e-28 N*s, which is about the same as my calculation for the vibrational photon.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the total momentum change when the molecule absorbs a photon, but that would require knowing how the momentum is imparted through the change in the center of mass, but I think that's not the case here.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem is using the rigid rotor model and the harmonic oscillator model. In that case, the energy levels are quantized for both, and the total energy is the sum.

In the harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are E_v = (v + 1/2) ħω.

In the rigid rotor, E_J = [ J (J+1) ħ² ]/(2I).

The fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would be (v=0, J=1), which has energy E = (0 + 1/2) ħω + [2 ħ²]/(2I) = (1/2) ħω + (ħ²)/(I).

So the difference is (ħ²)/(I) = 9.2e-23 J.

But that doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule can't change its rotational state without a vibrational change. Or perhaps the problem is using the model where the molecule is treated as a harmonic oscillator for vibration and a rigid rotor for rotation, but the total energy is the sum.

But the question is about the photon's momentum when the molecule transitions to the next state with the lowest energy. So the photon's energy should be the energy difference between the two states.

Given that, but none of the options match that, I'm starting to think I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the rotational energy is given by E_J = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), which for J=1 is (2 ħ²)/(2I) = ħ²/(I). So the energy difference is indeed ħ²/(I) = 9.21e-23 J.

Then, the momentum p = E/c = 9.21e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options are much larger, so perhaps the problem is expecting the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational frequency. Wait, perhaps there's a relation between the rotational energy and the vibrational energy.

But I'm not seeing a direct relation. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the moment of inertia differently.

Wait, let me recompute I:

I = μ R².

μ = (Mx My)/(Mx + My) = (20 * 2)/(22) amu = 40/22 ≈1.81818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.017e-27 kg.

R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

So I = 3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10)^2 = 3.017e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

Yes, correct.

Now, E_rot = ħ²/(2I) per J value. For J=0: E=0.

So for J=1, E = [1*(1+1) * ħ² ]/(2I) = (2 ħ² )/(2I) = ħ²/I.

So that's 9.21e-23 J.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is in its "fundamental vibrational state" but any rotational state. So perhaps the "fundamental state" is v=0, but J can be any state. Then, the next state could be a higher vibrational state, but that would require a higher energy.

But that doesn't fit with the question's wording. The molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state, combining both vibration and rotation.

So, if the molecule is in the fundamental state, and it's the lowest energy state, the next state would be the next possible lowest energy state, which is (v=0, J=1). So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, leading to p_photon of 3e-31 Ns.

But again, the options don't match this.

Wait, perhaps I've messed up the calculation of ħ²/(I).

Let me compute ħ²/(I) again.

ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 J² s².

I = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

So ħ²/I = 1.112e-68 / 1.2068e-46 = (1.112 / 1.2068) ) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.921e-22 → 9.21e-23 J.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the question is about the energy required for the molecule to switch to the next state, which could involve both J and v changes. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the energy levels as E = (v + J +1/2) ħω, but that doesn't make much sense because v and J are separate quantum numbers.

Wait, another thought: maybe the question is referring to the energy of the molecule in terms of the product of vibrational and rotational energy, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is combining the vibrational and rotational energies in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the non-rigid rotor model, which allows the bond to stretch, thereby changing the moment of inertia. But in that case, the energy levels would be different, but I'm not sure how to model that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule transitions to the next vibrational state, which would be v=1, regardless of rotation. Because in that case, the energy is ΔE = ħ ω, leading to p_photon = ħ ω / c = 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But why would the question say "next state with the lowest possible energy" if the rotational transition is lower in energy? Because the rotational transition requires much less energy, so the molecule would preferentially make that transition.

Unless the problem is intended to only consider vibrational transitions, perhaps.

In that case, the answer would be option D.

But given that the rotational transition has a lower energy, I'm not sure. But given the options provided, the only one matching the vibrational transition is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the unit conversion for I.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. Yes.

μ is correct: 3.017e-27 kg.

I = μ R² = 3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

Yes.

Hmm, perhaps the question is about the photon causing a transition to the next state in terms of the quantum number, not the energy. But that makes less sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the next state is the first excited state, which would involve a change in both v and J.

But without knowing the exact model, it's hard to say.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the question is using the formula for rotational energy as E = (J (J+1) B), where B is the rotational constant. B is given by ħ²/(2I).

So for J=0, E=0. J=1, E=2B.

But B = ħ²/(2I), so E_J=1= 2*(ħ²/(2I)) )= ħ²/(I ).

Which is the same as before: 9.21e-23 J.

So p_photon = 3.07e-31 Ns.

But again, none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the question's 'fundamental state' refers only to the rotational ground state, and the next state is a vibrational excitation. But that seems inconsistent with the terminology.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule transitions to the next higher energy state, which could involve both increasing v and J. But that would require considering the sum of the energy differences.

But I'm not getting any closer to matching the options.

Wait, looking at option A: 1.9e-28 Ns.

E_photon = p * c = 1.9e-28 *3e8 = 5.7e-20 J.

Which is about the same order as the vibrational transition, but not exactly.

Option D: 1.4e-28 Ns → E=4.2e-20 J, which is exactly ħω.

So perhaps the intended answer is D.

But why? Because the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, which should be the rotational transition.

Unless, perhaps, I made a miscalculation in the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps the rotational energy for J=1 is E_J=1 = (1*(1+1) * ħ² )/(2I) = (2 ħ² )/(2I) = ħ²/I.

But earlier calculation gives that as 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

I = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 = (approx) 1.112e-68.

So ħ²/I = 1.112e-68 / 1.2068e-46 = 9.21e-23 J.

So correct.

Hmmm, I'm stuck. All calculations point to the answer being around 3e-31 Ns, but none of the options are close to this. So perhaps the question is intended to have the vibrational transition as the correct answer, leading to option D.

But why would the question say "next state with the lowest possible energy" if that's not the case? Maybe the problem is assuming that the molecule can't change rotational state without a vibrational change.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the photon must provide enough energy to increase the vibrational state, and the rotational state is not considered here.

But that doesn't make much sense, because the rotational transition requires less energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the rotational transitions are forbidden in this scenario, so the molecule must undergo a vibrational transition.

But I'm not familiar with such a constraint in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a typo, and the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, option D is the closest to the vibrational transition, which is a standard problem.

So, given the options, I think the intended answer is D, 1.4e-28 Ns.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, where the molecule is in its fundamental state (v=0, J=0). The task is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The given parameters are:

- Mass of atom X: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \)
- Mass of atom Y: \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
- Bond length: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
- Angular frequency of vibration: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Levels in the Rotation-Vibration Model**:
   - The total energy of the molecule is the sum of vibrational and rotational energies:
     \[
     E(v, J) = E_v + E_J
     \]
     where:
     \[
     E_v = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) \hbar \omega, \quad E_J = \frac{J(J+1) \hbar^2}{2I}
     \]
     Here, \( I = \mu R^2 \) is the moment of inertia, and \( \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} \) is the reduced mass.

2. **Fundamental State**:
   - The fundamental state corresponds to \( v = 0 \) and \( J = 0 \), with energy:
     \[
     E(0, 0) = \frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega
     \]

3. **Next State with the Lowest Energy**:
   - The next possible states are:
     - \( v = 1, J = 0 \): Energy = \( \frac{3}{2} \hbar \omega \)
     - \( v = 0, J = 1 \): Energy = \( \frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega + \frac{\hbar^2}{I} \)
   - Comparing these, \( v = 0, J = 1 \) has lower energy because the rotational energy difference (\( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} \)) is smaller than the vibrational energy difference (\( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega \)).

4. **Photon Momentum for Rotational Transition**:
   - The energy difference for the rotational transition (\( v = 0, J = 0 \to v = 0, J = 1 \)) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}
     \]
     where \( I = \mu R^2 \). Substituting:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} \, \text{amu} = 1.818 \, \text{amu}
     \]
     Converting to kg:
     \[
     \mu = 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.017 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
     \]
     \[
     I = \mu R^2 = 3.017 \times 10^{-27} \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2
     \]
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.207 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - The momentum of the photon is:
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}
     \]
     This value is much smaller than any of the provided options.

5. **Photon Momentum for Vibrational Transition**:
   - The energy difference for the vibrational transition (\( v = 0 \to v = 1 \)) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \times (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - The momentum of the photon is:
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.22 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}
     \]
     This matches closely with option D (\( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - While the rotational transition requires less energy, the problem likely assumes the vibrational transition is the intended path, as the calculated rotational momentum does not match any of the options. Therefore, the correct answer is based on the vibrational transition.
