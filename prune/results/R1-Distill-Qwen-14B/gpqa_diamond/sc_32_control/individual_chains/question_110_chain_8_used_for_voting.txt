Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, the brighter the star (lower magnitude), the easier it is to detect. Wait, actually, no—apparent magnitude is what matters here, right? Because absolute magnitude is how bright they are intrinsically, but apparent is how bright they appear from Earth.

Wait, the question gives each star's parameters. Some stars have absolute magnitudes, others have apparent. So I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star if it's not provided, because that's what the spectrographs can detect.

So let me go through each star one by one.

Star1: Absolute V mag is 15.5, distance is 10 pc. I remember that the formula for apparent magnitude m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d) where d is distance in parsecs. So plug in d=10, log10(10)=1, so m=15.5 +5 +5*1=25.5? That can't be right. Wait, no, the formula is m - M = 5 log10(d) -5. Oh right, so m = M +5(log10 d) -5 + 5 log10 d? Wait, no. Let me think again. The formula is m = M +5 * (log10(d) -1) ) → which is m = M +5 log10(d) -5.

So for Star1, M=15.5, d=10. log10(10)=1. So m=15.5 +5*(1) -5= 15.5 +5 -5=15.5. Wait, that can't be. Because if a star is at 10 pc, its absolute and apparent magnitude are the same. Oh wait, no, because absolute magnitude is defined as the apparent magnitude at 10 pc. So yes, for Star1, m =15.5. So that's the apparent magnitude.

Now, can ESPRESSO and HIRES detect it? ESPRESSO can see up to 17 mag. Star1 is 15.5, which is less than 17, so it's within ESPRESSO's limit. HIRES can go up to 16 mag. 15.5 is less than 16, so yes. So Star1 can be detected by both. But wait, looking at the options, Star1 isn't in any of the options. So probably, the correct answer isn't Star1? Hmm, but let's check the options again. The options are A to D, and have pairs of stars. So perhaps Star1 is not in any pair.

Star2: Apparent V mag is 16.5. So for ESPRESSO, which can go up to 17, 16.5 is okay. So ESPRESSO can detect it. HIRES can go up to 16, so 16.5 is brighter than 16? Wait, no, wait, magnitudes are lower as brighter. So a star with apparent V mag 16.5 is fainter than 16. Because 16.5 is higher in magnitude. So HIRES can observe up to 16, so 16.5 is beyond that. So HIRES can't detect it. So Star2 can be detected only by ESPRESSO, not HIRES. So it can't be in the correct answer because the question asks for stars detectable by both.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5. But there's a note about E(B-V) = 0.6. So I think this is about interstellar extinction, which makes stars appear dimmer and redder. The formula given is that the total absorption in V band is E(B-V) multiplied by 3.1. So extinction in V band, A_V = E(B-V) * 3.1. So E(B-V) is 0.6, so A_V = 0.6 *3.1=1.86 mag.

So the apparent magnitude as observed would be m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. Wait, no, correction. The observed magnitude is dimmer, so the apparent magnitude (what we measure) is higher. Or, the formula is m_observed = m_true + A_V. Because extinction makes it appear fainter, so m increases. So Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5 +1.86=17.36 mag. Oh, wait, but does this mean the observed apparent magnitude is 17.36? So, for Star3, the observed V mag would be 17.36.

Wait, but let me get this right. The star's actual apparent magnitude without extinction is 15.5, but because of the dust, it's dimmed further. So the observed magnitude is 15.5 + A_V. So yes, 15.5+1.86=17.36. So Star3's V mag as observed would be 17.36.

So ESPRESSO can observe up to 17 mag. So 17.36 is beyond that. So ESPRESSO can't detect it. HIRES can observe up to 16. So 17.36 is way beyond. So Star3 can't be detected by either? Or wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, Star3's apparent magnitude is given as 15.5 mag, but that's the observed value after extinction. Or is the given 15.5 the intrinsic apparent magnitude? That's where I might be getting confused. Let me re-read the question.

The question says for Star3: apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6. Wait, does that mean that the star's intrinsic apparent magnitude is 15.5, and the extinction adds 1.86 mag? Or is the apparent magnitude given as 15.5, which already accounts for extinction?

Wait, the way it's phrased: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1."

Hmm, maybe the given apparent magnitude is the observed one, including extinction. Because normally, E(B-V) is the color excess, which includes the reddening due to interstellar dust. So if the star's apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, that's after extinction. So perhaps I shouldn't add any more extinction. Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is without extinction, and we have to calculate the observed one.

Wait, the question says: "Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1." So A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So if the star's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but without considering extinction, what's the observed?

Wait no, perhaps the star's apparent magnitude is the observed (after extinction). Because the question says, Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6. So perhaps the intrinsic apparent magnitude would be brighter by A_V.

Wait, I think I need to clarify. Apparent magnitude is what we observe, including any extinction. So if a star has an intrinsic apparent magnitude of m and extinction A, then the observed m_observed = m + A.

But the question says the star's apparent magnitude is 15.5. So that's m_observed. But wait, does that include the extinction, or is the extinction separate?

Wait, the question says: Star3 has apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6. So perhaps the apparent magnitude is the observed one, which includes extinction. So in that case, the intrinsic magnitude is m_intrinsic = m_observed - A_V.

Wait, but the question is about whether the spectrographs can detect the star. The spectrographs' limits are based on the apparent magnitude as observed (i.e., what they see). So, if the star's apparent magnitude is 15.5, then both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it, because 15.5 is less than 17 and less than 16. So Star3 would be detectable by both.

Wait, but now I'm confused. Let me read the question again.

The question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed [by ESPRESSO], while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed."

So for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag <17 detected. For HIRES, stars with V mag <16 detected.

So Star3's apparent mag is 15.5. So 15.5 <16 and <17. So both can detect it. So Star3 can be detected by both.

Wait, but earlier I thought there was extinction, but the question gives the apparent mag as 15.5, so maybe that already accounts for extinction. Hmm.

Wait, but the question includes a note about E(B-V) for Star3 and Star4. So perhaps the apparent magnitude given is the intrinsic, and the extinction makes it dimmer. Let's re-examine.

Wait, perhaps the apparent magnitude given is the observed. So Star3's apparent mag is 15.5, which is what we observe. So without any correction, it's 15.5, which is within both spectrographs' limits. So ESPRESSO can see it (15.5 <17) and HIRES can see it (15.5 <16). So Star3 can be detected by both.

But wait, earlier I thought that the apparent mag in Star3's case is the observed, including extinction. So yeah, it's 15.5, which is fine.

Wait, but Star3's E(B-V) is 0.6. So A_V is 1.86. So the intrinsic apparent magnitude would be m_intrinsic = m_observed - A_V. So m_intrinsic =15.5 -1.86=13.64. But that doesn't affect the observed apparent magnitude. The observed is 15.5, which is the value the telescope would see. So for detection, it's the observed apparent magnitude that matters.

So in that case, Star3's apparent mag is 15.5, which is within both limits. So both can detect it.

Moving on.

Star4: Absolute V mag is 15.5, distance is 10 pc. So same as Star1, so apparent mag is 15.5. E(B-V)=0.4. So A_V=3.1 *0.4=1.24. But wait, does that affect the observed apparent magnitude? Because the apparent magnitude given is 15.5, which includes the extinction. Or is it that the apparent magnitude is 15.5 without considering extinction?

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to think again. If a star is at 10 pc, its absolute magnitude is the same as its apparent magnitude, but only if there's no extinction. But if there's extinction, then the apparent magnitude would be higher. So perhaps the given apparent magnitude for Star4 is the intrinsic (without extinction). So I need to calculate the observed app mag by adding A_V.

Wait, but the question says Star4's apparent V mag is not directly given. Let me check: Star4's parameters:

- RA =85 deg, DEC=-48, absolute V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, located at 10 pc. So no apparent V mag is given. So I need to calculate it.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says for Star4: "absolute V magnitude of 15.5 mag... located at 10 pc." So distance is 10 pc, so apparent magnitude is same as absolute, 15.5. But then there's E(B-V)=0.4. So A_V= 3.1 *0.4=1.24. So the observed apparent magnitude would be 15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So Star4's observed apparent mag is 16.74.

So now, can ESPRESSO and HIRES detect Star4?

ESPRESSO: max 17. So 16.74 is less than 17 → yes.

HIRES: max 16. So 16.74 is higher than 16 → no.

So Star4 can be detected by ESPRESSO, but not HIRES.

Star5: Absolute V mag 16.5, located at 5 pc.

So calculate apparent mag m = M +5*(log10(5) -1)

Wait, let's compute:

log10(5)≈0.69897.

So m =16.5 +5*(0.69897 -1) )= 16.5 +5*(-0.30103) = 16.5 -1.505≈14.995, about 15.0.

So apparent mag is ~15.0.

So Star5's apparent mag is 15.0. Because it's located at 5 pc, which is closer, but the absolute magnitude is higher (brighter? No, absolute mag is higher, which is fainter. Because absolute magnitude is how bright it would appear at 10 pc. So 16.5 is dimmer than 15.5, so the star is fainter.

Wait, no, Star5's absolute mag is 16.5. So at 10 pc, it's 16.5. But it's only 5 pc away. So using the distance modulus: m = M +5 log10(d/10) → which is 16.5 +5 log10(5/10) → 16.5 +5 log10(0.5) → log10(0.5)= -0.3010 → 5*(-0.3010)= -1.505 → so m =16.5 -1.505=14.995, so ~15.0.

So apparent mag is 15.0. No mention of extinction, so Star5's apparent V mag is 15.0.

Can both spectrographs detect it? ESPRESSO can go up to 17 → yes. HIRES up to 16 → 15.0 <16 → yes. So Star5 can be detected by both.

So now, let's recap each star's detectability:

Star1: m=15.5 → both can detect.

Star2: m=16.5 → HIRES can't (needs <=16). ESPRESSO can (<=17). So only ESPRESSO can detect it.

Star3: m=15.5 → both can detect.

Star4: m=16.74 → only ESPRESSO can detect.

Star5: m=15.0 → both can detect.

Now, the question is asking which stars can be detected by both. So any pair that includes stars that both can be detected by both.

Looking at the options:

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can be detected only by ESPRESSO, so this pair is (only ESPRESSO can detect Star4, but both can detect Star5). So for this option, the pair would only be detectable by one of the spectrographs. So this isn't correct.

Wait, no. The question is, which stars can be detected with both spectrographs. So if a star can be detected by both, it's a candidate. So Star1, Star3, Star5 can be detected by both. Star2 and Star4 can only be detected by one each.

Looking at the options:

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star1 can be detected by both, Star4 only by ESPRESSO. So the pair can't be detected by both spectrographs.

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected by both spectrographs. So both can be detected by both. So this pair is a candidate.

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES, so this pair can't be detected by both.

Option C: Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can be detected only by ESPRESSO, so this pair can't be detected by both.

Option B is the pair of Star3 and Star5, both detectable by both.

Wait, let me check Star5 again. Star5's apparent mag is 15.0. So both can detect it. So it's a candidate.

So the correct answer would include any pair that consists of stars detectable by both.

So the possible stars are Star1, Star3, Star5.

Looking at the options, the only option that pairs two of these is option B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but let me check the options:

Option B is Star3 and Star5. So both are detectable by both spectrographs. So this pair is correct.

Another option, if any, would be an option that includes any two of Star1, Star3, Star5.

Looking at the given options:

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 is only detected by ESPRESSO.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both detected by both.

C) Star2 and Star3 → only Star3 is detected by both.

D) Star1 and Star4 → only Star1 is detected by both.

So the correct option is B.

Wait, but looking again at Star3's apparent magnitude. Earlier I thought it was 15.5. But wait, Star3's parameters include E(B-V)=0.6, so A_V=1.86, but the question states that the apparent mag is 15.5. So does that mean that the apparent mag is after correction for extinction? Or before?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. If the apparent magnitude given is the observed one (i.e., including extinction), then Star3's apparent mag is 15.5, which is acceptable for both spectrographs.

But if the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (without extinction), then the observed would be 15.5 +1.86=17.36, which is beyond both spectrographs.

Wait, but the question says that Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5, and the E(B-V) is 0.6. So the extinction is a factor, but the problem is about whether the star can be detected. The detection is based on the observed apparent magnitude. So if the star's apparent mag is 15.5, but with extinction, the observed mag would be brighter or fainter?

Wait, extinction makes stars appear fainter. So a star's observed apparent magnitude is higher (fainter) than the intrinsic. So if Star3's intrinsic apparent magnitude is m, then the observed is m + A_V.

Wait, but in the given data for Star3, the apparent magnitude is 15.5. Is that the intrinsic or the observed? Hmm. I think this is a crucial point.

If the apparent magnitude given is the observed (what we see), then extinction doesn't affect detection. Because the apparent mag is 15.5. So both can detect it.

If the given apparent mag is the intrinsic (without extinction), then the observed is 15.5 +1.86=17.36, which is beyond both spectrographs' detection limits.

Wait, the question says:

"Star3 ... apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us."

So the apparent V mag is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. So perhaps the apparent mag is the observed (so includes extinction), but then why is the E(B-V) given? Maybe to calculate something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the apparent magnitude given is the intrinsic, and the extinction is to be considered.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the apparent magnitude is the observed (what the telescope sees) or the intrinsic (as if there's no extinction). Because the question says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag", which, in astronomy, the apparent magnitude is the observed value, which includes any extinction. So if that's the case, then the extinction (E(B-V)) is extra information, possibly for another part of the problem.

Wait, but in this question, the extinction affects the apparent magnitude. So perhaps I have to calculate the observed apparent magnitude by adding the extinction.

Wait, let's think again: the apparent magnitude is what we observe. If the star emits light with an intrinsic apparent magnitude (without any dust), but dust makes it appear dimmer (higher magnitude), then the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

So if the question states that the apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is the observed value, then that's what we have. So the extinction is irrelevant for detection because the observed magnitude is given. So Star3's apparent mag is 15.5, which is acceptable for both spectrographs.

Wait, but why is the extinction given then? Maybe the extinction isn't relevant here because the apparent magnitude is already provided, and we just use that. So perhaps the E(B-V) is a distractor in this context.

So, Star3's apparent mag is 15.5, which is within both ESPRESSO and HIRES detection limits.

So with that, Star3 and Star5 can be detected by both spectrographs.

Thus, the correct answer is option B: Star3 and Star5.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. ESPRESSO can detect stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., $m < 17$), while HIRES can detect stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 16 mag (i.e., $m < 16$). For each star, we calculate or use the given apparent V magnitude to determine if it satisfies both detection limits.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**  
   - Absolute V magnitude: $M = 15.5$  
   - Distance: $d = 10 \, \text{pc}$  
   - Apparent V magnitude: $m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(1) - 5 = 15.5$.  
   - Detection: $m = 15.5 < 17$ (ESPRESSO) and $m = 15.5 < 16$ (HIRES).  
   - **Conclusion**: Star1 can be detected by both spectrographs.

2. **Star2**  
   - Apparent V magnitude: $m = 16.5$.  
   - Detection: $m = 16.5 < 17$ (ESPRESSO) but $m = 16.5 > 16$ (HIRES).  
   - **Conclusion**: Star2 can only be detected by ESPRESSO.

3. **Star3**  
   - Apparent V magnitude: $m = 15.5$.  
   - Extinction: $E(B-V) = 0.6$, so $A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 1.86$.  
   - The question specifies the apparent magnitude as $m = 15.5$, which is the observed value (already accounting for extinction).  
   - Detection: $m = 15.5 < 17$ (ESPRESSO) and $m = 15.5 < 16$ (HIRES).  
   - **Conclusion**: Star3 can be detected by both spectrographs.

4. **Star4**  
   - Absolute V magnitude: $M = 15.5$  
   - Distance: $d = 10 \, \text{pc}$  
   - Apparent V magnitude: $m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(1) - 5 = 15.5$.  
   - Extinction: $E(B-V) = 0.4$, so $A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 1.24$.  
   - Observed apparent magnitude: $m_{\text{observed}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74$.  
   - Detection: $m_{\text{observed}} = 16.74 < 17$ (ESPRESSO) but $m_{\text{observed}} = 16.74 > 16$ (HIRES).  
   - **Conclusion**: Star4 can only be detected by ESPRESSO.

5. **Star5**  
   - Absolute V magnitude: $M = 16.5$  
   - Distance: $d = 5 \, \text{pc}$  
   - Apparent V magnitude: $m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(0.5) - 5 = 16.5 - 1.505 \approx 15.0$.  
   - Detection: $m = 15.0 < 17$ (ESPRESSO) and $m = 15.0 < 16$ (HIRES).  
   - **Conclusion**: Star5 can be detected by both spectrographs.

### Final Answer:
The stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star3** and **Star5**. This corresponds to **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
