Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters because 1 cm³ is a milliliter and 1000 mL is a liter. 

The solution contains two substances: 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4●2H2O. I remember that these are phosphate salts. I think KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, and Na2HPO4●2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. 

The problem also gives me the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. Orthophosphate ions, I think, refer to PO4^3- ions. Wait, but wait: in aqueous solution, phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. H3PO4 can donate three protons, so the species can be H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

But when you mix different phosphate salts, it can form a buffer solution. I remember that when you mix a weak acid with its conjugate base, you get a buffer. So if I have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, what do those correspond to?

Let's think. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4●2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions, right? So in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, so H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donating a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (accepting a proton to become H3PO4). Similarly, HPO4^2- can act as an acid (donating a proton to become PO4^3-) or as a base (accepting a proton to become H2PO4^-).

So, the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are adjacent species in the phosphate dissociation series. This must form a buffer solution. The buffer is between the second and third ionization steps, but wait, no—H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion, which comes from the first deprotonation (H3PO4 → H2PO4^- + H+; Ka1). HPO4^2- comes from the second deprotonation (H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+; Ka2). So when you have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, they buffer around the pH corresponding to Ka2.

The question is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. Wait, but wait—PO4^3- is the fully deprotonated form. So in a solution with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, how much PO4^3- is present? Because PO4^3- is the third deprotonation step, which is Ka3. Since Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is a very small value, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low. So maybe the concentration of orthophosphate (PO4^3-) is negligible compared to the other species.

But the question specifically asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. So I need to calculate [PO4^3-].

Hmm, so how do I approach this? Let me try to outline the steps.

First, calculate the moles of each salt. Then, find the concentrations of each in the solution.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass / molar mass. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that: 1/136.09 is approximately 0.007338 mol. So about 0.007338 moles of H2PO4^-.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. 1/177.99 is approximately 0.005612 mol. So about 0.005612 moles of HPO4^2-.

Then, these two anions are present in the solution. Since they are in a buffer, the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Wait, but the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the relevant Ka is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa2 + log([A^-]/[HA]), where A^- is HPO4^2- and HA is H2PO4^-.

Wait, actually, in the equation, HA is the acid (H2PO4^-), which donates a proton to become A^- (HPO4^2-). So the ratio is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2). 

But wait, we don't know the pH yet. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the pH using the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present. So the solution is a buffer, and using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, we can find the pH. But the problem is that the solution is a mixture of two salts, so the pH depends on their concentrations and the Ka2.

So let's compute the concentrations. The volume is 0.2 L.

Concentration of H2PO4^-: 0.007338 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03669 M.

Concentration of HPO4^2-: 0.005612 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02806 M.

So the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is approximately 0.02806 / 0.03669 ≈ 0.765.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207 (since 6.2e-8 is 6.2*10^-8 → log(6.2) is about 0.79, so 7.207).

So pH = 7.207 + log(0.765). Log(0.765) is approximately -0.115. So pH ≈ 7.207 - 0.115 = 7.092.

Alternatively, maybe better to compute it more precisely. Let me see, 0.765 is the ratio.

Log(0.765) → approximately, since log(0.7) is -0.1549, log(0.76) is about -0.117, and 0.765 would be around -0.114.

So pH is around 7.207 - 0.114 ≈ 7.093.

So the pH is approximately 7.09.

Now, knowing the pH, can we find the concentration of PO4^3-?

PO4^3- comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-. The reaction is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+. The Ka for this is Ka3, which is 1.8e-12.

So, using the expression for Ka3: Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

We know Ka3 is 1.8e-12. [HPO4^2-] is 0.02806 M (since that's the concentration we calculated earlier). [H+] is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.093). Let's compute that.

10^(-7.093) → 10^(-7) is 1e-7; 0.093 is roughly 10^(-0.093) ≈ 0.805. So 10^(-7.093) ≈ (1e-7) * 0.805 ≈ 8.05e-8 M.

So putting it all together:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / (8.05e-8)

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 ≈ 5.0508e-14.

Denominator: 8.05e-8.

So 5.0508e-14 / 8.05e-8 ≈ (5.0508 / 8.05) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.6275 * 1e-6 ≈ 6.275e-7 M.

Wait, but wait, that's about 6.28e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is close. Hmm.

Wait, but wait another thought: the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02806 M, but in reality, some of that HPO4^2- will dissociate into PO4^3-, but since we're using the concentration before dissociation, does that affect the calculation? Or should I account for the change in concentration due to dissociation?

Wait, no, because when calculating the concentration of PO4^3-, we're using the equilibrium expression, which considers the dissociation. The initial concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02806 M, and a tiny amount x will dissociate into PO4^3- and H+.

But given that Ka3 is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02806, so we can approximate [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.02806.

So the initial approach is correct.

So, [PO4^3-] ≈ (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / (8.05e-8) ≈ 6.27e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculations more accurately.

Calculating [H+] → pH is 7.093, so [H+] is 1e-7.093.

Using a calculator for 10^-7.093.

Wait, 7.093 can be broken down as 7 + 0.093.

So 10^(-7) is 1e-7.

10^(-0.093) = 10^(-0.093) ≈ Let me compute this more accurately.

Let me recall that ln(10^x) = x * ln(10). So ln(10^(-0.093)) = -0.093 * ln(10) ≈ -0.093 * 2.302585 ≈ -0.2141.

So, e^(-0.2141) ≈ 0.807.

So, 10^(-0.093) = 0.807 approximately.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.807 ≈ 8.07e-8 M.

So, using that:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / (8.07e-8)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 = 5.0508e-14.

Denominator: 8.07e-8.

So 5.0508e-14 / 8.07e-8 = (5.0508 / 8.07) * 1e-6.

5.0508 / 8.07 ≈ 0.626.

So 0.626e-6 = 6.26e-7 M.

So approximately 6.26e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7. Close enough, probably due to rounding in the earlier steps.

Wait, but wait another thing: when calculating the initial moles, perhaps I should be more precise.

Calculating moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol.

136.09 is approximately 136.09. 1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007338 mol.

Similarly, 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005612 mol.

But perhaps more accurate would be better.

But these shouldn't change the final answer appreciably.

Wait, another thought: the total concentration of phosphate species. Do I need to consider that some H2PO4^- will dissociate into HPO4^2- and H+, and some HPO4^2- will dissociate into PO4^3- and H+.

But in reality, because the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the concentrations are governed by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. So the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in a fixed ratio based on pH.

Wait, but when considering PO4^3-, which is from the further dissociation of HPO4^2-, the presence of HPO4^2- will affect the amount of PO4^3-.

So perhaps I should calculate the pH first, then use that pH to calculate [PO4^3-].

Wait, but I did that already.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approach this using the exact expressions without assuming that the dissociation of HPO4^2- is negligible.

But given that Ka3 is so small, the [PO4^3-] should be very small, so the approximation is valid.

So, I think the approach is correct. The concentration is approximately 6.27e-7 M, which is closest to option A (6.24e-7).

Wait, but another thought. Let me recompute [H+], because maybe the pH calculation was a bit off.

I used pH ≈ 7.093, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

The Henderson equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Compute [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02806 / 0.03669 ≈ 0.765.

The ratio is 0.765, so log(0.765) is approximately -0.114.

pKa2 is 7.207 (since Ka2 is 6.2e-8 → pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) = 7.207).

So pH = 7.207 -0.114 =7.093. So that's correct.

So [H+] = 10^-7.093.

Compute 10^-7.093 more accurately.

Let me use the exact value.

7.093 can be written as 7 + 0.093.

So 10^(-7) = 1e-7.

Now, 10^(-0.093) = ?

Let me compute 10^(-0.093):

We know that:

log(8) = 0.9031, so 10^0.9031 =8.

Wait, alternatively, use natural logs.

ln(10^(-0.093)) = -0.093 * ln(10) ≈ -0.093 *2.302585 ≈-0.2141.

So, e^(-0.2141) = approximately 0.807 as before.

So [H+] ≈ 8.07e-8 M.

Wait, but let me use a calculator for more precise value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 10^(-0.093) using the Taylor series or a better approximation.

Using calculator-like approach:

We know that 10^0.093 ≈ ?

Wait, let me compute ln(2) ≈0.6931, ln(3)=1.0986, ln(10)=2.3026.

But perhaps better to use the formula that 10^x ≈ e^{x * ln(10)}.

Wait, for x = -0.093.

So, 10^-0.093 = e^(-0.093 * ln(10)) = e^(-0.093 * 2.302585).

Compute 0.093 * 2.302585.

0.093 * 2 = 0.186, 0.093 *0.302585≈0.02812. So total ≈0.21412.

So, e^-0.21412 ≈ ?

We can approximate e^-0.2 is 0.8187, e^-0.21 is approximately 0.808.

Wait, e^-0.21412 = ?

Let me compute using the Taylor series around x=0.2:

e^x is 1 + x + x²/2! + x^3/3! + ...

x = -0.21412.

e^-0.21412 ≈ 1 -0.21412 + (0.21412)^2/2 - (0.21412)^3/6 + (0.21412)^4/24.

Compute each term:

Term 1: 1

Term 2: -0.21412 → 0.78588.

Term 3: (0.21412)^2 = 0.04584 → 0.04584 / 2 =0.02292 → total 0.8088.

Term 4: (0.21412)^3 ≈ 0.00981 → /6 → 0.001635 → subtract: 0.8088 - 0.001635 =0.807165.

Term 5: (0.21412)^4 ≈0.002106 → /24 → 0.0000877 → add: 0.807165 +0.0000877≈0.80725.

So e^-0.21412 ≈0.80725.

So 10^-0.093 ≈0.80725.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.80725 ≈8.0725e-8 M.

So back to the calculation:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / (8.0725e-8).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 = (1.8 * 0.02806) e-12 → 0.050508e-12 → 5.0508e-14.

Denominator: 8.0725e-8.

So 5.0508e-14 / 8.0725e-8 = (5.0508 / 8.0725) * 1e-6.

5.0508 /8.0725 → approximately 0.6258.

So 0.6258e-6 =6.258e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 6.26e-7 M.

Looking back at the options:

A) 6.24e-7 M

B)5.48e-7

C)2.81e-7

D)3.97e-7

So option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is very close to our calculated 6.26e-7. The slight difference might be due to rounding errors in the precise calculation steps.

Wait, but wait another point. When we have both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 in solution, their dissociation contributes to the phosphate species. So H2PO4^- comes from KH2PO4, and HPO4^2- comes from Na2HPO4. 

Is there any possibility that some of the H2PO4^- converts to HPO4^2- or vice versa, but in reality, the buffer system maintains a ratio based on pH, which we've already accounted for.

Alternatively, perhaps the buffer pH is such that the amount of PO4^3- is negligible. But according to the calculation, it's around 6.2e-7 M.

Wait another thought: perhaps the question is about the sum of all phosphate species, but no, the question specifically asks for orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-.

So, the answer should be option A, 6.24e-7 M.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the moles. Let me check.

Molar mass of KH2PO4: K is 39.10, H2PO4 has H:2(1.008) =2.016, P:30.97, O4: 64 → 39.1 +2.016 +30.97 +64= 136.086 g/mol, which rounds to 136.09. So moles are 1.00 / 136.09 = approx 0.007338.

Molar mass of Na2HPO4·2H2O: Na2 is 2*22.99=45.98, HPO4 is (H:1, P:30.97, O4:64) → 1+30.97+64=95.97 → but wait, HPO4^3- is HPO4, so the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Wait, let me calculate the molar mass accurately.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 

Na: 22.99 * 2 =45.98 g/mol

H: in HPO4: 1, and in 2H2O: 2*2=4 → total H: 5.

P: 30.97.

O: 4 (from HPO4) + 2* (O in H2O is 1 per molecule, so 2*1=2 → total O from H2O is 2*1? Wait, no. Each H2O has O=16 g/mol as O. Wait, no, when calculating the molar mass, each H2O contributes 1 O. So for 2 H2O, O is 2*(16.00) =32.00 g/mol.

So HPO4: H:1, P:30.97, O:4*(16)=64. H2O: 2*(H2O) → 2*(2*1.008 +16.00) =2*(18.016)=36.032.

So Na2HPO4·2H2O molar mass:

Na2:45.98 + HPO4 (1+30.97 +64)=95.97 + 2H2O: 36.032 = 45.98 +95.97=141.95 +36.032=177.982 g/mol. Which matches the given 177.99 g/mol. So moles =1.00 g /177.99 g/mol ≈0.005612 mol.

So the earlier calculations are correct.

Another point to consider: the total volume is 200 cm³=0.2 L. So concentrations:

H2PO4^-: 0.007338 /0.2=0.03669 M.

HPO4^2-: 0.005612 /0.2=0.02806 M.

So the ratio is 0.02806/0.03669=0.765.

Henderson-Hasselbalch gives pH=7.207 + log(0.765) ≈7.207 -0.114=7.093.

So [H+]=10^-7.093≈8.07e-8 M.

Ka3=1.8e-12.

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/ [H+]

= (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / (8.07e-8)

= (5.0508e-14) / (8.07e-8)= approx 6.26e-7 M.

So yes, the calculation seems correct, leading to option A.

Wait, but wait: another approach perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the expression for PO4^3- in terms of HPO4^2- and pH.

But I think I've already done that.

So, conclusion: the concentration is approximately 6.24e-7 M, so option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the given data:

### Step 1: Moles of phosphate species
The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ (molar mass = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (molar mass = 177.99 g/mol). The moles of each species are calculated as:

- **Moles of KH₂PO₄**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007338 \, \text{mol}
  \]
  This dissociates into H₂PO₄⁻ ions.

- **Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005612 \, \text{mol}
  \]
  This dissociates into HPO₄²⁻ ions.

### Step 2: Concentrations in the solution
The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L. The concentrations of the phosphate species are:

- **[H₂PO₄⁻]**:  
  \[
  \text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.007338}{0.200} \approx 0.03669 \, \text{M}
  \]

- **[HPO₄²⁻]**:  
  \[
  \text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.005612}{0.200} \approx 0.02806 \, \text{M}
  \]

### Step 3: Buffer system and pH calculation
The solution is a buffer containing H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. The relevant equilibrium is governed by the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, \( \text{Ka}_2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right)
\]

Substitute the values:
- \( \text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207 \)
- \( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} = \frac{0.02806}{0.03669} \approx 0.765 \)

\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 + \log(0.765) \approx 7.207 - 0.114 = 7.093
\]

The hydrogen ion concentration is:
\[
[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.093} \approx 8.07 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 4: Concentration of PO₄³⁻
The third dissociation of phosphoric acid is governed by \( \text{Ka}_3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \). The equilibrium expression for this step is:

\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{PO₄³⁻}][\text{H}^+]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]

Rearranging for \([ \text{PO₄³⁻} ]\):
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H}^+]}
\]

Substitute the values:
- \( \text{Ka}_3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \)
- \( [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = 0.02806 \, \text{M} \)
- \( [\text{H}^+] = 8.07 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M} \)

\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02806)}{8.07 \times 10^{-8}} \approx \frac{5.0508 \times 10^{-14}}{8.07 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Final Answer
The calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (\( \text{PO₄³⁻} \)) is approximately \( 6.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches most closely with option **A** (\( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)).

**Answer: A**
