Okay, so I've got this physics problem about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Let me try to think it through. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about finding the mass dimension of κ and determining if the theory is renormalizable. The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, and σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. 

First, I remember that in quantum field theory, each term in the Lagrangian has to have a mass dimension of 4 because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c = 1). So each term in the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4, just like the other terms in the full Lagrangian (kinetic, mass terms, etc.).

Wait, but this is the interaction term, so I need to look at each field's dimension and see how κ fits in. 

Let me recall the mass dimensions of the fields. For a Dirac field ψ, the mass dimension is 3/2. Because in four spacetime dimensions, the Dirac equation is first order, so the field must have dimension 3/2 to make the kinetic term (∂ψ)² have dimension 4. 

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism or another gauge field. The field strength tensor F has mass dimension 2 because it's derivatives of the gauge field A. Since A has dimension 1 (because it's like a vector potential, and ∂A is in the field tensor), F is ∂A, so dimension 1 + 1 = 2.

Now, let's analyze the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Breaking it down: ψ̄ is the adjoint spinor, which has the same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2. σ_{μν} is a product of γ matrices and their commutators. The gamma matrices are dimensionless since they're just matrix operations. So σ_{μν} has the same structure as [γ_mu, gamma_nu], which doesn't add any mass dimension. So the term ψ̄ σ ψ has dimensions of (3/2) + (3/2) )= 3. Because when you multiply two fields, their dimensions add.

Then, F^{μν} has dimension 2. So the entire product inside the Lagrangian is (3) + (2) )= 5. 

But wait, the Lagrangian has to have dimension 4. So the term κ times (5) must equal 4. That means κ must have dimension 4 -5 = -1. 

So [κ]_M is -1.

Now, about renormalizability. I remember that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≥ 0. Because if a coupling has negative mass dimension, the interaction term would have higher than renormalizable dimension. Because each vertex in Feynman diagrams contributes a factor of the coupling, and if the coupling has negative dimension, the diagram would involve higher powers of momentum, leading to worse UV behavior.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think again. The general rule is that a term in the Lagrangian is renormalizable if its dimension is less than or equal to 4 (since the action is dimensionless, each term must have dimension 4). But more precisely, each coupling's dimension determines the superficial degree of divergence. The superficial degree of divergence D is given by D = 4 - (sum of the dimensions of each coupling in the vertex). For a vertex with a coupling κ of dimension [κ], if [κ] is negative, then each vertex contributes a negative term, which can lead to D being positive, implying that the diagram is divergent and needs higher-order counterterms, making the theory non-renormalizable.

Wait, but wait. Let me get it straight. The superficial degree of divergence formula is D = d - (sum of (each coupling's dimension * n_couplings) + (sum of (each field's dimension * n_fields))) ), but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, another formula comes to mind: for each vertex, each leg contributes a certain dimension. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the scaling of the Lagrangian.

Alternatively, another approach: in a renormalizable theory, all interaction terms in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension ≤4 for each term. Wait, that's not right. Because each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4, as the action is dimensionless. So for the interaction term to be renormalizable, the coupling must have mass dimension such that each term is dimension 4.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is: for a theory to be renormalizable, all interaction terms must have their coupling constants with non-negative mass dimension. Because couplings with negative mass dimension would imply that the interaction term has higher dimension than 4, which isn't allowed in renormalizable theories.

Wait, but the interaction term is already of dimension 4. So the coupling's dimension is determined by the other fields. So for this term, the dimension is 4. The product of fields and the coupling must sum to 4.

In our case, [κ] = -1. So the coupling has negative mass dimension. That's a bad sign for renormalizability. Because when you have a coupling with negative mass dimension, it implies that the interaction term has a higher dimension than 4. Wait, that's not right because the term is dimension 4. Wait, no, because the product of fields and coupling is 4. So if [κ] is negative, the fields must compensate with higher dimensions to still sum to 4.

But wait, I think that the presence of a coupling with negative mass dimension implies that the term is non-renormalizable. Because typically, in four dimensions, a coupling term is renormalizable if its dimension is ≥0. For example, in φ^4 theory, the coupling has [λ] = 0, so it's renormalizable.

Wait, but let me think about the superficial degree of divergence. The formula for the superficial degree of divergence is D = 4 - (sum of (number of fields * their dimensions) + (number of couplings * their dimensions)). Wait, perhaps that's not exactly correct, but I think each vertex contributes a certain amount.

Alternatively, another formula: for each vertex, the superficial degree contribution is based on the number of momentum factors. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the power counting.

Each term in the Lagrangian contributes certain factors to the Feynman diagrams. For a term like ψ̄ σ F ψ, which is dimension 4, but the coupling is dimension -1. Let's see what the Feynman rules say about the amplitude. Each vertex would have a factor involving κ, which has dimension -1. For each vertex, the coupling contributes a factor of κ, so the amplitude is proportional to κ^{number of vertices}. 

In loop integrals, each loop contributes a integral d^4k, which is dimension 4. For a diagram with L loops, I = ∫d^4k ... which is dimension 4L. The superficial degree of divergence D is given by D = 4L - (sum of the superficial degrees from each vertex and propagator). 

Wait, I'm getting a bit lost. Alternatively, perhaps a simpler approach: a coupling with negative mass dimension suggests that the term in the Lagrangian has a higher dimension (since the coupling is negative, and the fields would have to sum up to something higher). But in our case, the term in the Lagrangian is dimension 4. So the fields have to compensate. 

Wait, but I know that renormalizable theories require that all couplings have dimension ≥0. Because if a coupling has a negative dimension, then the term would have a dimension higher than 4, but wait, in our case, the term is dimension 4, so the coupling is negative but the product of fields must be higher. So the interaction term would have higher dimension, but that can't be because the Lagrangian must have terms of dimension 4.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the answer options. The options are either κ has dimension -1 or 1, and the theory is renormalizable or not.

Looking back, [κ] = -1. Now, is the theory renormalizable? Well, this is a four-dimensional theory. In four dimensions, for a theory to be renormalizable, all interaction terms must have coupling constants with positive mass dimension or zero. Because in 4D, the maximum allowed dimension for a coupling is 4, but in practice, it's 0, 1, 2, etc., but I think that for renormalizability, the dimension must be ≥0.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. The dimension of the coupling is determined by the term's dimension. Since the term is dimension 4, and the fields have dimensions. The coupling's dimension is 4 minus the sum of the fields' dimensions.

In this case, the term is ψ̄ σ ψ F. Each ψ is 3/2, so two ψ's sum to 3. F is 2. So 3 + 2 =5. So [term] is 4, so [κ] = 4 -5 = -1.

But if the coupling has [κ] = -1, which is negative, then the term is non-renormalizable because the coupling has negative mass dimension. Because, in general, in 4D, each term in the Lagrangian must be renormalizable, which requires that the coupling has [κ] ≥0.

Wait, but wait another point: in 4D, the renormalizability condition. The interaction term must have a coupling with dimension [κ] ≥0. Because, for each vertex, the coupling contributes a certain factor. If [κ] is negative, then each vertex brings in a negative dimension, leading to higher superficial degree of divergence, which implies that the theory is not renormalizable because you can't renormalize all the divergences with a finite number of counterterms.

So, in this case, since [κ]=-1, which is negative, the theory is not renormalizable.

So putting it all together, the mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. Looking at the options, option C says [κ]=-1 and not renormalizable. So the correct answer is C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the interaction term in the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2} \left[ \gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu \right] \).

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The Dirac spinor \( \psi \) has a mass dimension of \( \frac{3}{2} \), so \( \bar{\psi} \) also has dimension \( \frac{3}{2} \).
- The field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has a mass dimension of \( 2 \), as it is derived from the gauge field \( A_\mu \), which has dimension \( 1 \).

### Step 2: Mass dimension of \( \kappa \)
The interaction term must have a total mass dimension of \( 4 \) (since the Lagrangian density must have dimension \( 4 \) in four spacetime dimensions). Breaking down the term:
- \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi \) has a total dimension of \( \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3 \), since \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is a commutator of dimensionless gamma matrices.
- \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has a dimension of \( 2 \).

Thus, the combined dimension of \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) is \( 3 + 2 = 5 \). To ensure the term has a total dimension of \( 4 \), the coupling constant \( \kappa \) must have a dimension of:
\[
[\kappa]_M = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. In this case, \( \kappa \) has a mass dimension of \( -1 \), which is negative. Couplings with negative mass dimensions imply that the interaction term has a higher dimension than \( 4 \), leading to divergences that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms. Therefore, the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is \( -1 \), and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option **C**.
