Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question gives me that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is c multiplied by matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), right? And the matrix S has the first row as [0, -i] and the second as [i, 0]. So I can write that out as:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Then, A_y = c * S, so plugging in c gives me:

A_y = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Wait, but wait—the problem says that A_y is given by c multiplied by S. So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Because the question is about which statement is correct during that calculation.

First, I'll remember that for any 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0, where I is the identity matrix and a is the eigenvalue.

So let's compute A_y - a I:

A_y - a I = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] - a * [[1, 0], [0, 1]]

Which would be:

[[ -a , (h/(4π))*(-i) ],
 [ (h/(4π))*i , -a ]]

The determinant of this matrix is:

( (-a)(-a) ) - [ (h/(4π))^2 * (-i)(i) ) ]

Wait, the off-diagonal terms are (h/(4π))*(-i) and (h/(4π))*i. So the product is (h/(4π))^2 multiplied by (-i)(i). Let me compute that: (-i)(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. So the determinant becomes:

a^2 - [ (h/(4π))^2 * 1 ] = 0.

So the equation is a^2 = (h/(4π))^2.

Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π). Wait, but that's the real part? Or is this the eigenvalue? Wait, no, because S itself is a matrix with complex entries, but when multiplied by c, which is real, the matrix A_y has complex entries. So the eigenvalues could be complex? Or am I missing something here.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, A_y is a 2x2 matrix, but let's think about S. Matrix S is a Pauli matrix, right? The Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Oh wait, wait, no—the structure of S given here is sigma_y multiplied by i. Let me think: the Pauli matrix sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so S is exactly sigma_y. So A_y = (h/(4π)) * sigma_y.

So the eigenvalues of sigma_y are ±1, right? Because Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So when you multiply by a scalar, the eigenvalues are scaled. So in this case, A_y has eigenvalues (h/(4π)) * (1) and (h/(4π)) * (-1). So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers, not complex. So any statement suggesting the eigenvalues have imaginary parts must be incorrect.

Looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh or something. That doesn't match. Option B says imaginary parts of ±1/2 and real parts of ±1, which also doesn't fit because our eigenvalues are purely real and ±h/(4π). Wait, h is Planck's constant. So h/(4π) is a real number, but I'm not sure about the exact value. But for this problem, the important point is the eigenvalues are real, so the imaginary parts are zero. So options A and B which suggest the eigenvalues have imaginary parts can't be correct.

So now, looking at the other options, C and D.

Option C states that the eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of the Z-component, A_z. Hmm. Let me think about angular momentum. In quantum mechanics, the total angular momentum J has components J_x, J_y, J_z, and J². The eigenfunctions of J² and J_z are the spherical harmonics, but if you have an eigenfunction of J² and J_x, then it's not an eigenfunction of J_z (since J_x and J_z don't commute). Similarly, if a state is an eigenstate of A² (which is J², perhaps?), then it can't be an eigenstate of J_z (or A_z) unless it's a simultaneous eigenstate.

Wait, but wait, the operator A is the intrinsic angular momentum operator for the muon. Assuming that the muon is a spin-1/2 particle, so the total angular momentum is J = L + S, but perhaps here, A is the spin part. So A would have components A_x, A_y, A_z. The square A² would be (ħ/2)^2 times something, since for spin-1/2, S² is (s(s+1)ħ²) which is (3/4)ħ². But perhaps that's besides the point.

So, for a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenfunctions of A^2 are the same as the eigenfunctions of the magnitude squared of the spin. Since A^2 is a scalar, all eigenfunctions of A^2 are also eigenfunctions of A^2. Now, can an eigenfunction of A_y also be an eigenfunction of A²? Well, because A² commutes with all components of A. Because [A², A_x] = 0, [A², A_y]=0, [A², A_z]=0. So any eigenfunction of A_x, A_y, or A_z can also be an eigenfunction of A². But they can't be eigenfunctions of two different components (since they don't commute). So the statement in option C says the eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A². That should be correct, right? Because A² commutes with A_y.

But option C says they can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of A_z. Wait, so if a state is an eigenstate of A_y and A², it can't be an eigenstate of A_z. That is true because A_y and A_z don't commute, so you can't have a state that's eigenstate of both. But the question is about the eigenfunctions of A_y—can they also be eigenfunctions of A²? Yes, because A² commutes with A_y. So the statement in C is correct in that aspect. But the second part says they cannot be eigenfunctions of A_z. Well, that's correct because if you have an eigenstate of A_y, it's not an eigenstate of A_z. So the statement in C is correct.

Wait, but wait. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. So when you calculate the eigenfunctions of A_y, you can also see if they are eigenfunctions of other operators.

Alternatively, another approach: the eigenvectors of A_y would be the same as the eigenvectors of S_y (since c is a scalar and doesn't affect eigenvectors). S_y has eigenvectors |+> and |->, which are eigenstates of S_y. Now, do these eigenvectors also serve as eigenstates of A²? Yes, because A² is S² times c squared, but since c is a scalar, the same eigenvectors would be eigenstates of A². So option C is correct in stating that they can be eigenfunctions of A². So the first part of option C is correct, the second part says they are not eigenfunctions of A_z. Which is also correct because A_y and A_z don't commute. So option C's statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of A_y are the basis functions of the matrix operator A_y given above. Hmm. Wait, the basis functions for a 2x2 matrix are the standard basis vectors. If the operator A_y is 2x2, its eigenfunctions are vectors in a two-dimensional space. The basis functions are just the standard basis vectors, but the eigenvectors of A_y may or may not align with these basis vectors. For the given S_y matrix, which is sigma_y, the eigenvectors are (1, i) and (1, -i) but scaled appropriately. So they are not the standard basis vectors, but they form a basis for the space. So the statement in D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Wait, the eigenfunctions are vectors in the space, but the basis functions are the standard basis vectors. So unless the eigenfunctions happen to be the standard basis vectors, which they aren't in this case, option D would be incorrect. Because the eigenfunctions are specific vectors, not the basis functions of the matrix operator. So I think option D is incorrect.

So putting it all together, the correct statement is option C: The eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of the Z-component, A_z.

Wait, but the question is, which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalue and eigenvectors of A_y. So during that calculation, which statement would I consider to be correct.

Wait, but how about the eigenvalues? Let me clarify that again. Earlier I thought the eigenvalues of A_y are ±h/(4π), but that's because S has eigenvalues ±1. Wait, wait: S is sigma_y, which has eigenvalues ±1. So A_y = (h/(4π)) sigma_y. So the eigenvalues are c times the eigenvalues of S. So a = c * 1 and a = c * (-1). So a = ± (h/(4π)).

So the eigenvalues are real, not complex. So any option that talks about the eigenvalues having imaginary parts is incorrect. So options A and B are incorrect.

So now, looking at the options, the only possible correct statements are C and D.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. But the basis functions are the standard basis vectors, but the eigenvectors are different. So D is incorrect.

So the correct answer must be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon, represented as a 2×2 matrix. The operator is given by \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = h/4\pi \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matrix \( S \) corresponds to the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \), which has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm h/4\pi \), which are real numbers. This means any option suggesting that the eigenvalues have imaginary parts is incorrect.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm h/4\pi \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are purely real (\( \pm h/4\pi \)).

2. **Option B**: Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 1/2 \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm h/4\pi \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm 1/2 \).

3. **Option C**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of the Z-component \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) cannot be eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).

4. **Option D**: Claims that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is incorrect because the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are specific vectors in the 2D space, not the standard basis vectors.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \).

Answer: C
