Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's photosphere relates to the temperature. The question mentions that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, LTE means that each small region of the star's atmosphere behaves like a blackbody at a certain temperature.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relation here. Oh right, the excitation of atoms is described by the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. The formula is something like (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the excitation level is given as twice as excited. So, if I let n1 be the number of excited atoms in star_1 and n2 in star_2 for the same energy level, then n1 = 2 n2. But wait, wait, the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the ratio is (n1_upper / n1_lower) compared to (n2_upper / n2_lower)?

Wait, no, the problem states that the specific energy level is twice as excited. Maybe it's about the ratio of atoms in a higher energy state to the lower state. So, for star_1, let's say the ratio is R1 = n1_upper / n1_lower, and for star_2, R2 = n2_upper / n2_lower. The question says that R1 is twice R2. So, R1 = 2 R2.

But wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited". Hmm, I'm not entirely clear on whether it's the population ratio or some other factor. But I think the key here is the ratio of the populations in the same energy level. Alternatively, perhaps it's the ratio of the number of atoms in a certain excited state compared to the lower state, which is governed by the Boltzmann factor.

So using the Boltzmann equation, the ratio R = (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). Assuming that the statistical weights (g) are the same for both stars, as it's the same element and same energy levels, then the ratio R depends exponentially on the temperature.

So for star_1, R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)), and for star_2, R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)). Wait, wait, wait. Actually, the equation is R = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)). If g_upper and g_lower are the same for both stars, then the ratio R1/R2 would be exp[ (ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ) ].

Wait, let me double-check. So, R1 = (g_up/g_low) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and R2 = same factors but for T2. So the ratio R1/R2 = exp[ ( -ΔE/(k T1) ) - ( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) ] = exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ).

But according to the problem, R1 is twice R2. So R1/R2 = 2.

Putting it together: 2 = exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/T2 - 1/T1 ) ). Take the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(2) = ΔE/(k) ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) ).

Wait, but the question says that the energy difference is ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Interesting, because the Boltzmann constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE is numerically equal to k. So, ΔE = k_B * 1. So ΔE = k.

Wait, let me calculate that. Boltzmann constant k is about 1.380649e-23 J/K. So if ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, that's approximately k * (1 K). So, ΔE/(k) = 1. So this would make the equation much simpler.

So, going back, ln(2) = (1) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ). So ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1).

Wait, but wait, the way we wrote it was (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2).

Wait, but let's rearrange this equation. Let's write it as:

ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1) = -(1/T1 - 1/T2) )= (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So, ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Hmm, looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, so the equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

But wait, in our setup, it's 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2), and that equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), but with a negative sign. Wait, let me do the algebra again.

Let me write 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). No, wait, (1/T2 - 1/T1) equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) → multiply numerator and denominator.

Wait, let me compute:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So, yes, that's correct.

So, from the Boltzmann equation, we have (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2) * (ΔE)/(k).

Wait, no, wait, the earlier equation after substituting was ln(2) = (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ). But ΔE/k = (1.38e-23 J)/(1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K. So, ln(2) = (1 K) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ).

So, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2)/1 → 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2).

But also, from earlier, we have ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, wait, but earlier I thought that ln(2) = (1/T2 -1/T1) ), but that led to an equation that is (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs.

Because, (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2).

But since ΔE is positive, (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2) * k / ΔE.

But since ΔE = k, (1/T2 -1/T1 ) = ln(2).

So, 1/T2 -1/T1 = ln(2).

Rearranging:

1/T2 = 1/T1 + ln(2).

But if I take 1/T2 -1/T1 = ln(2), then:

( T1 - T2 )/(T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2).

Wait, because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) = ln(2).

So, that would give (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ) = ln(2).

Which is option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ).

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the signs. Because, in the Boltzmann equation, the higher energy level is less populated, so if T increases, the exponent is more negative, so the ratio R (n_upper / n_lower) decreases. Wait, but in this problem, R1 is twice R2, meaning R1 > R2. So if star_1 has higher excitation, perhaps it's hotter? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, let's think. The Boltzmann factor is exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). So, when T increases, the exponent becomes a smaller negative number, so the value increases. So, higher T means more population in the upper energy level, so R increases.

So if R1 = 2 R2, which is higher, that would imply that T1 is higher than T2. Because a higher temperature leads to a higher R. So, T1 > T2.

In the equation (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

So, the numerator is positive, denominator positive, so the equation holds.

Looking at the options again:

A) ln(2) = T2/T1 → No, doesn't match.

B) ln(2) = (T1+T2)/(T1 T2) → No.

C) ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2)^2 → No, denominator is squared.

D) ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) → Yes.

So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann distribution governs the relative populations of atoms in energy levels, and the energy difference between the levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann equation is:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_{\text{upper}} \) and \( g_{\text{lower}} \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. Assuming the statistical weights are the same for both stars, the ratio of excitation levels for the two stars is given as \( R_1 = 2R_2 \), where \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) are the excitation ratios for star_1 and star_2, respectively.

Taking the natural logarithm of the ratio \( R_1 / R_2 \), we get:

\[
\ln(2) = \Delta E / k \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \) (as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}.
\]

Rewriting this in terms of \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \), we have:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. The other options are inconsistent with the derived equation:

- **Option A**: \( \ln(2) = T_2 / T_1 \) does not match the derived relationship.
- **Option B**: \( \ln(2) = (T_1 + T_2) / (T_1 T_2) \) is incorrect because the numerator should involve a difference, not a sum.
- **Option C**: \( \ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 T_2)^2 \) is incorrect because the denominator is squared, which is not consistent with the derivation.

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
