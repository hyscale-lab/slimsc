Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully. The question is about identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I'll try to understand the structure of the target molecule. So, the main chain is a cyclohexane ring. Attached to it is a carbonyl group (since it's a carbaldehyde), so the ring has a -CHO group. Then, there's a substituent at position 1 (the same carbon as the aldehyde?) which is a cyclohexyl group connected via a hydroxymethyl group. Wait, the substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So it's like a cyclohexane ring attached to a CH(OH)-cyclohexane? Or maybe the substituent is -(cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, meaning the group is CH(OH)-cyclohexyl attached to the main cyclohexane.

Wait, I think the target structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent. So, the main ring has an aldehyde group, and at the adjacent carbon (position 1?), there's a substituent which is a cyclohexyl group connected via a CH2 group that has an OH. So the substituent is CH2-OH attached to the cyclohexane ring. Wait, no. The substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl, which would be a CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group attached to the main ring. So maybe the structure is:

The main ring is cyclohexane with a -CHO group attached to one carbon. On the same carbon as the aldehyde, there's a substituent which is a CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group. So the structure is cyclohexane with a -CHO and a -(CH(OH)Cyclohexyl) group on the same carbon.

Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Another possibility: the substituent is attached to the main ring. So the main ring is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and on the same carbon as the aldehyde, there's a CH2OH group that's also connected to a cyclohexane. So it's like:

O=CH-C(cyclohexyl)-CH2-OH? No, that doesn't fit the name given. Let me think again. The name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the aldehyde is on the cyclohexane, and at position 1, there's a substituent which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group.

So the substituent is a CH2 group with a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group attached. So the substituent is -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl. Or maybe -CH2-OH and a cyclohexyl on the same carbon? Hmm, no, wait. The substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. So it's a methyl group (CH2-) with a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group attached. So, the substituent would be -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl. Wait, but that would make it a secondary alcohol.

Alternatively, maybe it's -CH2-OH and also attached to a cyclohexyl group. So the substituent is CH2OH connected to a cyclohexyl group. Wait, that would be a CH2 group connected to both the main ring and a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl? Maybe it's -(CH2OH)(cyclohexyl). No, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring where one carbon has an aldehyde group (-CHO) and another carbon is attached to a CH2OH group, which is also connected to a cyclohexyl group. No, that doesn't fit the name. The substituent is at position 1, so the same carbon as the aldehyde?

Wait, maybe I should draw this. The main ring is cyclohexane. Carbon 1 has the aldehyde group (-CHO). Attached to carbon 1 is a substituent which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So that substituent would be a methyl group (CH2-) where one hydrogen is replaced by OH and the other is replaced by cyclohexyl. So, the substituent would be CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). So the structure is cyclohexane with a -CHO and a CH(OH)cyclohexyl group on the same carbon.

So the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring, with a -CHO and a CH(OH)-Cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon.

Now, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. So the starting material is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group.

The task is to find the correct reagent sequence to go from ethynylcyclohexane to the target.

So, I'll think about the steps required. Let's think about the transformations needed.

First, the ethynyl group is a triple bond. To introduce a substituent, perhaps we can do a hydroboration or another addition. Alternatively, perhaps we can perform a hydration of the triple bond.

Wait, the triple bond in ethynylcyclohexane could be converted into a carbonyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to add some group and then perform further reactions.

Wait, let me think about the possible steps. Let's outline the steps needed.

The target has a hydroxyl group attached to a carbon adjacent to another cyclohexane ring. That suggests that perhaps a Grignard or organometallic reagent is involved to add a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group first. For example, via a hydration reaction. The triple bond can be hydrogenated to a cis double bond, but if we use a different reagent, perhaps we can get a carbonyl.

Wait, when a triple bond is treated with Hg(OAc)2 in presence of acid (like H2SO4), it undergoes hydration to form a ketone. That's the acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkyne to a ketone. So ethynylcyclohexane could be converted to cyclohexanone. Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is (cyclohexyl)acetylene. So, adding Hg(OAc)2 and H2SO4, H2O would give cyclohexyl ketone.

Wait, but let's think: the structure of ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. So when we add Hg(OAc)2 and H2SO4, H2O, it would add water across the triple bond. Since it's an internal alkyne, it would form a ketone. So, the triple bond would become a ketone. So the product would be cyclohexyl ketone, which would be cyclohexanone.

Wait, no. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2CH2... no, wait, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. So the structure is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH substituent. So when we hydrate the alkyne, we would add water to the triple bond. Since the triple bond is between two carbons (the ring carbon and a CH2 group?), wait, no. Let me clarify.

Actually, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. So the structure is:

cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH, no, that's not correct. Wait, no. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡C-H group attached. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So the cyclohexane is connected directly to the triple bond. So it's cyclohexane-C≡CH.

Wait, that can't be right. Because ethynyl is -C≡CH. So the structure is cyclohexane with a triple bond attached directly: cyclohexane-C≡CH.

Wait, but that would mean that the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and a CH group. So, the molecule is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH substituent. So when we add Hg(OAc)2 and H2SO4, H2O, it would add water to the triple bond, converting it into a ketone. The alkyne is at the end, so upon hydration, it would form a ketone. So cyclohexane would have a carbonyl group. So the product would be cyclohexanone.

Wait, but cyclohexanone is a ketone, and our target molecule is an aldehyde. So that's not directly helpful. Unless perhaps the aldehyde is formed through oxidation of an alcohol, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated first to form a cis double bond. Then, perhaps some addition reactions.

Wait, maybe the triple bond can be used in a different way. Let me think of the possible reactions.

Another approach: perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group, but in a different position. Wait, maybe we can do a reduction first.

Wait, let me think about the target molecule again. The target has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and a substituent that has a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group. So perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction or some kind of addition.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a bromide, and then undergoes a substitution or elimination. Or perhaps it's better to add a functional group that can be further modified.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the triple bond is converted into a ketone (as before), and then undergoes some kind of addition. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible reagents.

Looking at the options, the reagents in the options vary. Let's look at the options provided.

Option A: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Option B: 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O;4. NH4OH.

Option C: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2.

Option D: 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S;4. NH4OH.

Hmm. So the reagents involve NaNH2, H2/Pd, Ba(OH)2, HgSO4/H2SO4, Li/NH3, O3, (CH3)2S, etc.

Now, NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation, especially in alkyne chemistry. For example, in the formation of Grignard reagents from alkynes. Or perhaps for elimination reactions.

Methyl chloride is a methylating agent. So if we have NaNH2 and methyl chloride, perhaps we're doing some alkylation.

H2/Pd is hydrogenation. So hydrogenation of a triple bond would give a single bond, but more likely, perhaps a cis or trans double bond, depending on the catalyst. Wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and Pd would give cis addition. Or wait, the hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and a catalyst like Lindlar's would give cis, but with Pd, it might hydrogenate all the way to an alkane? Or maybe to a cis-alkene.

Wait, no. Hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and a palladium catalyst (like Pd on carbon) usually hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, making it a single bond, i.e., an alkane. But sometimes, if the catalyst is poisoned (like Lindlar's catalyst), it gives cis-alkene. Without poisoning, perhaps it goes all the way.

Wait, in option C, step 2 is H2 with Pd-calcium carbonate. That's a typical catalyst for full hydrogenation of triple bonds to single bonds. So step 2 in option C would convert the triple bond to a single bond, making the molecule ethylcyclohexane (but that's already the starting material? Wait, no, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a triple bond. So step 2 in option C would hydrogenate it to cyclohexane with a single bond to CH2CH3? No, wait. Wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane: -C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. So after hydrogenation, it becomes -CH2CH3 attached to the cyclohexane.

So that would make the molecule cyclohexane with an ethyl group attached. Then, what's next? Step 3 in option C is O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozone is used for ozonolysis. So if the molecule is cyclohexane with an ethyl group, after ozonolysis, what happens?

Wait, ozonolysis cleaves double bonds. If the molecule is ethylcyclohexane (after hydrogenation), there's no double bond. So that can't be right. So perhaps step 2 is not hydrogenation but something else.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's think again. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane: cyclohexane with a triple bond (C≡CH) attached. NaNH2 and methyl chloride would deprotonate the triple bond and perform alkylation, adding a methyl group. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base; with methyl chloride, perhaps it's a methyl Grignard-like reaction.

Wait, alkynes can be deprotonated by NaNH2 to form an alkyne anion, which can then react with alkyl halides. So in step 1 of option A, NaNH2 and methyl chloride would add a methyl group to the alkyne.

So after step 1, the alkyne becomes a longer alkyne? Wait, but NaNH2 is a base, perhaps deprotonating the alkyne to form a strong base, which then reacts with methyl chloride to add a methyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a vinyl lithium or something, but more likely, it's an alkyne alkylation.

Wait, for example, in the presence of a strong base like NaNH2, an alkyne can be deprotonated to form an acetylide. Then, treating with methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate the acetylide, adding a methyl group.

So ethynylcyclohexane + NaNH2 (deprotonate) → cyclohexylacetylide. Then, adding methyl chloride would give (cyclohexyl)propargyl methyl ether? Or perhaps not, since methyl chloride is a methylating agent.

Wait, actually, when an acetylide reacts with an alkyl halide, it adds the alkyl group to the acetylide. So the triple bond would be extended. So ethynylcyclohexane (HC≡C-Cyclohexane) would become CH2CH2... Wait, no. Let me think: if we have HC≡C-R (R is cyclohexyl), and we treat with NaNH2, which deprotonates the alkyne to form R-C≡C^- Na^+. Then, adding methyl chloride (MeCl), the methyl group would attack the acetylide carbon, giving R-C≡C-CH3, but wait, that's not possible because the acetylide is already at the end.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The acetylide would have the structure R-C≡C^− Na^+ . Adding methyl chloride would add a methyl group to the acetylide's carbon, so R-C≡C-CH3? But that's R-CCl-C-CH3? No, maybe it would give R-C≡C-CH2Cl? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the methyl chloride is involved in alkylation, adding a methyl group to the acetylide. So R-C≡C^− + CH3Cl → R-C≡C-CH2Cl + NaCl. But then, perhaps further reaction is needed. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a longer alkyne.

Wait, perhaps I should think about step 1 in each option.

Option A: step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride.

So, ethynylcyclohexane treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride. The alkyne is deprotonated to form an acetylide, which then reacts with methyl chloride to form a new alkyne. So, the product after step 1 would be (cyclohexyl)propane-1-yl group? Wait, maybe the alkyne becomes longer.

Wait, perhaps the product is R-C≡C-CH3, but wait, no, the initial structure is R-C≡CH. So after adding methyl chloride, would it become R-C≡C-CH3? But that would require adding two methyl groups. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the NaNH2 and methyl chloride are used for a different purpose, like deprotonation and methylation elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the initial step is to make a cyclohexyl lithium or something, but that's more for organometallic reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to convert the alkyne into an alkene.

Wait, another thought: NaNH2 is a strong base that can cause elimination reactions. If we have an alkyne and a good leaving group, perhaps elimination occurs. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is to form a Grignard reagent. But wait, NaNH2 is a base, not a metal like Mg, so perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the target molecule. It has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the main ring which also has a carbonyl group.

So, perhaps the synthesis involves introducing the cyclohexyl group via a Grignard or similar addition to a carbonyl.

Wait, but the starting material is an alkyne. So perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl, then treated with a Grignard reagent to add a cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an alkyne that can then undergo a cycloaddition, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is used to form a ketone, which then undergoes a cyclohexane ring expansion or something. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is functionalized to form a carbonyl, then a Grignard is added to form a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized or something.

Wait, let's try to outline the steps.

1. Start with ethynylcyclohexane (R-C≡CH, R is cyclohexyl).

2. Step 1: React with NaNH2 and methyl chloride.

After this step, perhaps the triple bond is extended. Because NaNH2 deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which can then react with methyl chloride (CH3Cl) as an alkylating agent. So, the acetylide (R-C≡C^-) would react with CH3Cl to form R-C≡C-CH3. So the product after step 1 would be R-C≡C-CH3, which is 1-propynylcyclohexane or something.

Wait, but that may not be correct. The acetylide would have the structure R-C≡C^- Na^+ . Then, adding CH3Cl would add a methyl group to the acetylide carbon. So the product would be R-C≡C-CH3. So the triple bond is now between the R group and the CH3.

Wait, but that's perhaps a longer alkyne. Then, step 2 in option A is H2/Pd. That would hydrogenate the triple bond into a single bond. So R-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. If the alkyne is R-C≡C-CH3, hydrogenation would add H's across the triple bond. So R-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond (R-C≡C-R') would typically add two H's to each carbon, turning it into R-CH2-CH2-R'.

So, in this case, R is cyclohexyl, and R' is CH3. So after hydrogenation, it would become cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the molecule becomes cyclohexane with a propyl group attached.

Wait, but that's not the target. The target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is not full. Maybe it's a partial hydrogenation to a cis-alkene. But without a poison catalyst, palladium would probably hydrogenate the triple bond all the way to a single bond.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is first converted into an alkyne with a leaving group. Then, a substitution reaction occurs, adding a cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a ketone, and then a Grignard reagent is added to the ketone to form an alcohol, which is then oxidized to the aldehyde.

Wait, but the target has both an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group attached to the same carbon. So maybe the aldehyde is formed via oxidation of a primary alcohol.

Wait, let's think about the steps another way.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (aldehyde) and a substituent that is CH(OH)cyclohexyl.

So, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard addition. So, the main ring would have a carbonyl, and the Grignard adds a nucleophile which is a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, but how do we get the cyclohexyl group into the molecule? Maybe via a Grignard reagent or another organometallic.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → (step 1) introduce a carbonyl group → cyclohexanone.

Then, perform a Grignard reaction to add a cyclohexyl group to the carbonyl, forming cyclohexanol after hydrolysis. Then, perhaps oxidize to form the aldehyde.

Wait, but that would give a secondary alcohol, not a primary one. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is used to form a longer chain, which is then cleaved.

Wait, another possibility: the ethynyl group is converted into a bromide, then undergoes a substitution reaction with a cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to think about the possible reagents. Looking at the options again, perhaps the steps involve alkyne alkylation, hydrogenation, ozonolysis, etc.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2/ethyl chloride, Li/NH3, O3/H2O, NH4OH.

So, step 1 would form an extended alkyne with an ethyl group. Then, step 2 is Li/NH3, which is a strong base, maybe for elimination or forming a carbanion.

Wait, Li/NH3 is used for Birch reductions or for deprotonation to form enolates or carbanions. Alternatively, in the presence of an alkyne, perhaps it's used for forming a lithium acetylide. But after step 1, the alkyne is longer, maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve forming a cyclohexyl group via elimination, then some ozonolysis.

Wait, Ozone followed by workup (like H2O or (CH3)2S) is used to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, if after some steps, a double bond is formed, ozonolysis would break it.

Option C's steps include O3 and (CH3)2S. (CH3)2S is a reductive workup, which would give aldehydes or ketones depending on the double bond structure.

Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the target molecule again. It's a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group and a substituent that is a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl.

So perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard addition to a ketone. Then, the Grignard would add to the carbonyl, forming an alcohol, which is then oxidized to the aldehyde.

Wait, but then the substituent would be on the same carbon as the aldehyde. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to form a ketone first, then add a Grignard to form an alcohol, which is then oxidized. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to:

1. Convert the alkyne to a ketone.

2. Perform a Grignard addition to the ketone to introduce the cyclohexyl group.

3. Work up the Grignard (acid workup gives alcohol).

4. Oxidize the primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

Wait, but the target has both the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl group on the same carbon.

Wait, perhaps the ketone is adjacent to the cyclohexane ring. Let me think.

Another approach: perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether or some other functional group.

Wait, let me think about each option's steps.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne alkylation, adding methyl group.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate the alkyne to single bond, making a longer chain.

3. Ba(OH)2 → a strong base, perhaps elimination? Or for epoxide ring opening. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, used for elimination reactions, like forming alkenes from alcohols via E2.

But wait, after step 2, the molecule would be ethylcyclohexane, perhaps. Then step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which would need an alcohol to eliminate. But ethylcyclohexane is just an alkane, so perhaps I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is for epoxidation, but Ba(OH)2 isn't used for that. Hmm.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkyne becomes longer, R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li/NH3 → perhaps deprotonate to form a carbanion, which could attack something.

3. O3/H2O → ozonolysis, which requires a double bond. So maybe step 2 forms a double bond, which is then cleaved.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is a dehydrohalogenation or elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, but after step 1, the molecule is R-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then, step 2 is Li/NH3, which is a strong base. Maybe it abstracts a proton adjacent to the triple bond, leading to an elimination reaction, forming a double bond. So the triple bond would become a double bond.

Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, which would form carbonyl groups.

So, for example, if the molecule becomes R-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 after step 1, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps step 2 in option B is a Birch reduction? No, Birch is for aromatic rings.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to think about each option in more detail.

Option D: 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3, (CH3)2S;4. NH4OH.

So, step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Methanol is a nucleophile. With NaNH2, perhaps it's a deprotonation and O-methylation.

Wait, the alkyne is HC≡CR. Deprotonating with NaNH2 would give RC≡C^-Na^+. Then, adding MeOH would perhaps form an ether or something else. Alternatively, could it be a nucleophilic substitution?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, but I don't see how with MeOH.

Wait, another possibility: NaNH2 and MeOH could form a Grignard-like species, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the NaNH2 is used to form a sodamide, which then reacts with methanol.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider that each option's steps and see which makes sense.

The target molecule has both an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane ring. To get the aldehyde, perhaps oxidation is involved.

Wait, perhaps the aldehyde comes from an alcohol. So, the alcohol is first formed, then oxidized. And the hydroxymethyl group comes from some addition.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is first hydrogenated to form a cis-alkene, which is then subjected to some dihydroxylation or epoxidation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)- group, which is attached to the main ring. So perhaps the CH(OH) group is formed via hydroboration or some addition to a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a cyclohexene ring, which is then dihydroxylated to form a vicinal diol, which is then cleaved or modified.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexane ring is opened, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach involves:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → convert triple bond to a ketone (using HgSO4/H2SO4, H2O). So, cyclohexanone.

2. Then perform a Grignard reaction with cyclohexyl magnesium bromide to add a cyclohexyl group to the ketone, forming a secondary alcohol.

3. Then, oxidize the secondary alcohol to a ketone again. But that doesn't fit the target.

Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde comes from a primary alcohol, so perhaps the Grignard adds to the ketone to form a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized. But oxidation of a secondary alcohol gives a ketone, not an aldehyde.

Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps the ketone is first formed, then a double bond is introduced adjacent to it, which can be subjected to a hydroxylation to form a diol, which can then be cleaved.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is formed via a conjugate addition or some other process.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to think about each option again.

Option C: Steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate (hydrogenation).

3. O3 / (CH3)2S.

4. Ba(OH)2.

So, step 1: alkyne is treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride, which would add a methyl group to the alkyne, making R-C≡C-CH3. Then, step 2: hydrogenate with H2 and Pd-CaCO3 to convert triple bond into single bond, making R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, step 3: ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. But ozonolysis requires a double bond. The molecule after step 2 is a single bond. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe step 2 doesn't hydrogenate all the way. If the catalyst is CaCO3 with H2 and Pd, perhaps it's a partial hydrogenation. Alternatively, maybe step 2 is a hydrogenation of the triple bond to a trans double bond.

Wait, but without a poisoned catalyst, H2 and Pd would typically hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So that would give a single bond, and then ozonolysis in step 3 wouldn't have anything to cleave.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not looking correctly.

Wait, perhaps step 3 is ozonolysis of a diene. But how would that form?

Another possibility: Maybe the initial steps form a diene, which is then cleaved.

Wait, perhaps step 1 adds a methyl group to the alkyne, making a longer alkyne. Then, step 2 hydrogenates the alkyne to a cis-alkene. Then, step 3 ozonolysis would cleave the cis-alkene into two carbonyl groups.

But let me think: if step 1 extends the alkyne to R-C≡C-CH3, step 2 hydrogenates to R-CH2-CH2-CH3 (single bond), but that wouldn't form a double bond. So that doesn't help with ozonolysis.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about step 2. Maybe the catalyst in step 2 is different. For example, if the catalyst is Lindlar's, it would hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis-alkene. But in option C, step 2 is H2 with Pd-calcium carbonate, which I think is for full hydrogenation.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to form a longer chain.

2. Hydrogenate to a cis-alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Ba(OH)2 for elimination or something else.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to form a ketone via hydration, then add a cyclohexyl group via Grignard, then oxidize to aldehyde.

But the target has both the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl group on the same carbon, so that might not fit.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a CH(OH)cyclohexyl group and a CHO group. So perhaps the CHO is from an aldehyde group, and the CH(OH)cyclohexyl is a Grignard addition.

Wait, but the Grignard would add to a carbonyl, creating a new carbon-carbon bond. So if the Grignard adds a cyclohexyl group to a ketone, that would form a secondary alcohol. Then, oxidation would turn it back into a ketone, which wouldn't give us the aldehyde.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the Grignard adds to an aldehyde, forming a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized to the aldehyde again. But that doesn't make sense because the oxidation would stop at the aldehyde.

Wait, but the target has both a primary alcohol and the aldehyde on the same carbon, which isn't possible. So perhaps the Grignard adds to a ketone, and the resulting alcohol is on the same carbon as the aldehyde.

Wait, maybe a cross-aldol addition? Or perhaps a conjugate addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the Grignard adds to a ketone to form a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone. But that doesn't give the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence involves forming an aldehyde first.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via some steps.

Wait, here's an idea: the alkyne can be converted into an aldehyde via multiple steps.

1. Convert alkyne to a ketone (acid-catalyzed hydration).

2. Then reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol.

3. Then perform an oxidation to form a ketone again, but I don't see how that gets an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, which is then oxidized.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D.

Option D's steps are:

1. NaNH2, methanol.

2. Li/liq. NH3.

3. O3, (CH3)2S.

4. NH4OH.

So step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. As I thought earlier, ethynylcyclohexane reacts with NaNH2 to form an acetylide, which then reacts with methanol. So the product would be R-C≡C-OCH3? No, because methanol is an alcohol, not a methylating agent. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide reacts with methanol in a nucleophilic substitution, but I don't think that's possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's an alkylation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the NaNH2 and methanol are used for something else, like forming a Grignard-like reagent.

Wait, another thought: NaNH2 is a strong base used in deprotonation. Methanol is a weak acid. In the presence of a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps the methanol is deprotonated to form MeO^- Na^+.

But I'm not sure how that would help.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 in option D converts the alkyne into a ketone via some mechanism, but I can't see how.

Hmm.

Another approach: let's think about each step of the correct option.

The target molecule has an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Convert the ethynyl group into an aldehyde.

But how? One way is to hydrate the alkyne into a ketone, then reduce the ketone to an alcohol, then oxidize that to an aldehyde. But that would require more steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to an alkene, then subjected to ozonolysis to form a carbonyl.

Wait, but ozonolysis requires a double bond. So perhaps the steps are:

a. Ethynylcyclohexane → hydrogenate triple bond to cis-alkene.

b. Ozonolysis → cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

c. Then, perform some reactions to form the substituents.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, if the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls. For ethynylcyclohexane, which is R-C≡CH, hydrogenation would give R-CH2-CH2. Ozonolysis of R-CH2-CH2 would not make sense because it's a single bond. Wait, no, the hydrogenation of the triple bond would give R-CH2-CH2, but that's an alkane, not an alkene. So ozonolysis can't act on that.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a trans-alkene, then ozonolysis is done. But without a double bond, ozonolysis can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to convert the alkyne into a ketone, then add a Grignard reagent to form a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone again, but that doesn't give an aldehyde.

This is getting quite challenging.

Let me think of the target molecule again. The substituent is a -CH(OH)cyclohexyl group attached to the main ring, which also has a -CHO.

So perhaps the -CHO is derived from an aldehyde, and the -CH(OH)cyclohexyl is from a Grignard addition.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → (step 1) convert to a ketone (cyclohexanone).

2. Then perform a Grignard reaction with cyclohexyl magnesium bromide to add a cyclohexyl group to the ketone, forming a secondary alcohol.

3. Oxidize the secondary alcohol to a ketone. But that doesn't give the aldehyde.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the Grignard adds to a carbonyl, giving a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

But then, how is the cyclohexyl group added?

Wait, perhaps the ketone is first converted into an aldehyde, then the Grignard adds to the aldehyde, forming a primary alcohol. Oxidation of that would give back the aldehyde, but then where does the hydroxymethyl group come from?

Alternatively, perhaps the Grignard adds twice, but that would lead to a quaternary center, which might not fit.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for the correct option based on the steps.

Option B's steps:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkyne becomes longer.

2. Li/NH3 → deprotonate or eliminate to form a double bond.

3. O3/H2O → cleave the double bond.

4. NH4OH → workup.

So, step 1: R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li/NH3 (strong base) → perhaps elimination to form an alkene.

So, R-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 becomes R-CH2-CH=CH-CH3? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a trans-alkene. Then, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the correct option is B. Let me think about the steps.

Option B:

1. NaNH2 and ethyl chloride → alkyne is extended to R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li/NH3 → perhaps elimination, forming a double bond between the two central carbons. So, R-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 becomes R-CH2-CH=CH2 (if possible). Wait, but that would require removing a CH2 group.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is converted into a double bond. So R-C≡C-CH2CH3 → R-C=C-CH2CH3.

Then, ozone would cleave the double bond into carbonyls.

So, if we have R-CH2-CH=CH-CH3, ozonolysis would break it into R-CH2-CHO and O=CH-CH3, but that's not the case.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C.

Option C's steps:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride → alkyne becomes R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-CaCO3 → hydrogenate to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → but no double bond, so this doesn't make sense.

So perhaps option C isn't correct.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2 → ? Maybe elimination to form a double bond.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → hydration of the double bond to a diol.

But then, how does that form the substituent?

Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the alkyne is converted into a ketone via hydration (step 3 in option A), but option A's step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which is a base.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not seeing it.

Wait, let's think about each reagent's role.

NaNH2 is a strong base, used in deprotonation. When used with alkyl halides, it can alkylate acetylides.

H2/Pd is for hydrogenation.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, used in elimination reactions (like E2).

HgSO4/H2SO4/H2O is for acid-catalyzed hydration of alkynes to ketones.

Li/NH3 is a strong base, used in deprotonation, elimination, or forming carbanions.

O3 is for ozonolysis.

(CH3)2S is a reductive workup in ozonolysis, preventing overoxidation.

NH4OH is ammonium hydroxide, used in workup after ozonolysis.

So, perhaps the correct sequence is as follows:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride to form a longer alkyne.

2. This alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene.

3. Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

4. Workup with a reagent like (CH3)2S to form aldehydes.

But how does this lead to the target molecule?

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

- Alkyne is extended, then hydrogenated to double bond.

- Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond, forming two carbonyl groups.

- One of these is the aldehyde group, and the other may form the hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not exactly seeing how.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diketone via ozonolysis.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the reagent sequences.

Looking at option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps an alkyne is converted into an ether or something.

2. Li/NH3 → maybe deprotonation to form a carbanion.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH → workup.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, perhaps the steps in option C are:

1. Alkyne is extended with methyl chloride.

2. Hydrogenated to a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis can't act, so perhaps this option is not correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option D.

Wait, step 1 in D is NaNH2 and methanol.

So, ethynylcyclohexane + NaNH2 → acetylide.

Then, acetylide + methanol → perhaps R-C≡C-OCH3? No, because methanol is an alcohol, not a methylating agent.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution, but I don't think that's possible here.

Alternatively, NaNH2 is a strong base; perhaps it's used to deprotonate something else, but I'm not sure.

In the end, I'm not entirely confident, but perhaps the correct option is B.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has both an aldehyde and a secondary alcohol. So, perhaps through ozonolysis, a diketone is formed, which is then reduced in some way.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B, as it involves ozonolysis.

But without a clear understanding, I'll try to make an educated guess.

Based on the steps, the correct sequence likely involves:

1. Alkyne alkylation to form a longer chain.

2. Hydrogenation to form a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis to cleave into carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form aldehyde and other groups.

But I'm not sure which option fits this.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, another thought: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is on the same carbon as the aldehyde.

So, perhaps the Grignard adds a cyclohexyl group to a carbonyl, forming a secondary alcohol. Then, the secondary alcohol is oxidized to a ketone, but that doesn't give the aldehyde.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess.

Looking back, the target molecule requires the introduction of both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group. The steps likely involve Grignard addition and perhaps ozonolysis.

Option C's steps include ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup, leading to aldehydes. So, perhaps option C is the correct one.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, I'll go with option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) and a substituent at the same carbon, which is a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group (-CH(OH)-cyclohexyl). The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Option A:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: This step likely alkylates the alkyne, extending it to a longer alkyne (R-C≡C-CH₃).
2. **H₂/Pd**: This step hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, forming R-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: This strong base could induce elimination, but the molecule at this stage (R-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃) lacks functional groups that would undergo elimination.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: This step hydrates alkynes to ketones, but the molecule at this stage is saturated, so this step would not contribute to the target structure.

### Option B:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: This step extends the alkyne to R-C≡C-CH₂CH₃.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: This strong base could induce elimination, forming a double bond (R-CH=CH-CH₂CH₃).
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, forming carbonyl groups. However, the cleavage pattern does not align with the target structure.
4. **NH₄OH**: This step neutralizes ozonolysis byproducts, but the sequence does not lead to the desired substituents.

### Option C:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: This step extends the alkyne to R-C≡C-CH₃.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: This step hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, forming R-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but the molecule at this stage is saturated, making this step ineffective.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: This strong base could induce elimination, but the molecule lacks functional groups to undergo elimination.

### Option D:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: This step likely deprotonates the alkyne, forming an acetylide, which reacts with methanol. However, the exact transformation is unclear.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: This strong base could deprotonate or induce elimination, but the intermediate structure is ambiguous.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but the molecule at this stage is unclear, making this step ineffective.
4. **NH₄OH**: This step neutralizes ozonolysis byproducts, but the sequence does not lead to the desired structure.

### Conclusion:
The target molecule requires the introduction of both an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl substituent. None of the options clearly achieve this transformation. However, based on the analysis, **Option C** is the most plausible, as it involves steps that could potentially align with the formation of the target structure, despite ambiguities in the sequence.
