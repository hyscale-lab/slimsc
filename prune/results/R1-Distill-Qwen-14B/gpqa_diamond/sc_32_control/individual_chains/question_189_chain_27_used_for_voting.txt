Okay, so I've got this physics question here about particles and symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see what I can remember. The question is asking which of the given particles isn't associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. The options are A) Phonon, B) Skyrmion, C) Magnon, D) Pion.

Wait, I think I remember that particles like phonons, magnons, and pions are related to Goldstone bosons. Goldstone's theorem says that when a symmetry is spontaneously broken, massless bosons appear. But wait, I thought phonons are more about crystal lattices and vibrations, right? Like in solids, so maybe they are related to broken translational symmetry in crystals. But aren't they considered as Goldstone bosons for some broken symmetry?

Magnons are related to the spin waves in magnetic materials. So, if the magnetic material has a broken symmetry, like when it's magnetized and the spins are aligned, the original symmetry (like rotation symmetry) is broken. So magnons would be Goldstone bosons in that scenario.

Pions are a bit different. I remember that pions are mesons, and they are the Goldstone bosons for the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the chiral symmetry of QCD. So when the chiral symmetry is broken in the early universe or something, pions emerge as the Goldstone bosons. But wait, I also heard that pions are massive particles because of something called the chiral anomaly or maybe due to the breaking of some other symmetry. Oh wait, no, in the Standard Model, the chiral symmetry is broken explicitly via the Higgs mechanism, but I'm getting confused here.

Skyrmions, I think, are a bit different. Skyrmions are topological solitons, right? They were proposed by Skyrme as a model for nucleons. They are solutions in a theory with pionic fields and are associated with baryon number. Skyrmions are not Goldstone bosons, are they? Because they're solitons, which are more like particles arising from the topology of the vacuum rather than from spontaneous symmetry breaking. So Skyrmions might not be associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry.

Wait, but the question is about which particle is NOT associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. So the options are A to D, and I need to pick the one that doesn't fit.

So, let's go through them:

A) Phonon: As I thought earlier, phonons are Goldstone bosons for the broken translational symmetry in a crystal. So yes, they are associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking.

B) Skyrmion: Skyrmions are topological defects, not Goldstone bosons. So they don't come from spontaneous symmetry breaking. So this would be the answer.

C) Magnon: As a spin wave, associated with the broken symmetry in magnetic systems. Goldstone boson, so yes.

D) Pion: Goldstone boson for chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. But wait, pions are actually pseudo-Goldstone bosons because the symmetry is only approximate. But they are still associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking.

So the one that's not associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking is Skyrmion, which is option B.

To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, let us analyze each option:

- **A) Phonon**: Phonons are quantized vibrations of a crystal lattice and are considered Goldstone bosons. They arise due to the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry in crystalline materials. Thus, phonons are associated with spontaneously broken symmetry.

- **B) Skyrmion**: Skyrmions are topological solitons, not Goldstone bosons. They are solutions in a model proposed by Skyrme and are associated with the topology of the vacuum rather than spontaneous symmetry breaking. Therefore, Skyrmions are not linked to spontaneously broken symmetry.

- **C) Magnon**: Magnons are spin waves in magnetic materials and are Goldstone bosons. They emerge due to the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry in magnetized systems. Hence, magnons are associated with spontaneously broken symmetry.

- **D) Pion**: Pions are mesons and act as pseudo-Goldstone bosons in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). They arise from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, though the symmetry is only approximate. Thus, pions are associated with spontaneously broken symmetry.

The particle that is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the Skyrmion.
