Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is related to the crystal structure and the Miller indices. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think.

Rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So in this case, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, which I think is the lattice parameter 'a'. Oh wait, but wait, interatomic distance in a crystal is the distance between adjacent atoms, which for a simple cubic structure would be the edge length of the unit cell. But in a rhombohedral structure, which is a type of hexagonal close-packed crystal? Or wait, no, rhombohedral is part of the cubic system, right? Or is it a separate system?

Wait, I think rhombohedral has a = b = c, and all angles equal. So it's a special case of the hexagonal crystal system? Or maybe the trigonal system. Wait, I'm mixing things up. Oh right, the rhombohedral system is a subset of the cubic system, but when the angles are not 90 degrees, it's called rhombohedral. So in this case, all edges are the same (a=10A), and all angles are 30 degrees.

The interplanar distance, d, for a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ, and Miller indices (hkl) is given by the formula:

1/d² = (h²/a²)(1/(sin² α / 2 + cos α)) + similar terms for k and l?

Wait, no, wait. I think the formula is more accurately given by:

1/d² = (h²/l²) [ (sin² α + sin² β + sin² γ ) / 2 - (sin α sin β sin γ) ) ] + ... Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, there's another formula I've heard of for orthorhombic systems, but this is rhombohedral, which is a more general case.

Wait, no, maybe the general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is:

1/d² = (h²/a²)( (sin²θ₁)/2 + (sinθ₁ sinθ₂ cosθ₃) ) + ... Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should look for a better approach.

Wait, I remember that for a cubic system, the formula is straightforward: d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But this isn't a cubic system because the angles aren't 90 degrees. So the standard cubic formula won't apply here.

I think the correct general formula involves the reciprocal of the structure factor. Oh right, the formula is:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk \cos\gamma) - 2(hl \cos\beta) - 2(kl \cos\alpha) } } } * a

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, I've heard of the formula involving the unit cell parameters and the angles. Let me think. The interplanar distance is given by the formula:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) } }

Wait, that seems plausible. Because in the cubic case, where α=β=γ=90°, the cos terms become zero, and the formula reduces to d = a/sqrt(h² +k² + l²). So that checks out.

In this problem, the crystal is rhombohedral, so a = b = c =10 A, and α = β = γ =30 degrees. The Miller indices are (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1.

So plugging into the formula:

d = a / sqrt( 1² +1² +1² - 2*(1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos 30) )

Wait, compute the denominator:

Sum = 1 + 1 + 1 =3

Then the second part: 2*( sum of cos terms )

Each cos 30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So 3 terms: 3 * (2 * (1*1 * cos30)).

Wait, no, the formula is:

sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

So let's compute each term.

hk = 1*1 =1, so 2*(1*1 * cos30) = 2*(0.8660) = 1.732.

Similarly, hl =1*1 * cos30 → same as above.

kl=1*1 * cos30 → same.

So the total inside the sqrt:

3 - 2*( (1*1 cos30) + (1*1 cos30) + (1*1 cos30) )

Wait, no. Let me re-express the formula:

Inside the sqrt: h² +k² + l² - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma)

Wait, but in rhombohedral, all angles are same, α=β=gamma=30 degrees.

So:

h² +k² + l² = 1+1+1=3.

Then, the second part is 2*( hk cos α + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma )

Which is 2*(1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30 )

So 3 terms, each (1*1 * cos30), multiplied by 2.

So each term is (1 *1 * cos30) = (0.8660).

Summing the three terms: 3 * 0.8660 = 2.598.

Multiply by 2: 5.196.

So the denominator inside the sqrt: 3 -5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, that can't be right because sqrt of a negative number is impossible. So I must have made a mistake here.

Hmm, that can't be. So perhaps I got the formula wrong. Alternatively, maybe the formula is written differently. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for d is:

d = \frac{ a }{ \sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha) } } }

Wait, but if alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees, then perhaps the signs are positive? Because in some conventions, the angles are defined differently.

Wait, wait, perhaps I have the signs wrong. Maybe in the formula, the second term is subtracted, but the individual terms are with different signs. Alternatively, maybe the formula is:

d = \frac{ a }{ \sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma) } } }

Wait, but that would lead to the same problem as before. Let me think, maybe I need to check the correct formula.

Another approach: perhaps I should refer to the general formula for interplanar spacing in any crystal system. The general formula is given in terms of the reciprocal of the metric tensor. The metric tensor g is:

g = [ [ a^2, ab cos gamma, ac cos beta ],
       [ ab cos gamma, b^2, bc cos alpha ],
       [ ac cos beta, bc cos alpha, c^2 ] ]

But in our case, a = b = c =10 A, and alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

So the metric tensor becomes:

g11 = a² = 100 (A²)
g12 = a² cos gamma = 100 * cos 30 = 100 * (sqrt(3)/2) ≈86.6025
g13 = a² cos beta = same as g12, since beta=30.
g22 = a²=100
g23 = a² cos alpha= same as g12.
g33=100.

So the metric tensor is symmetric:

[ 100      86.6025    86.6025 ]
[ 86.6025  100       86.6025 ]
[ 86.6025  86.6025   100     ]

The reciprocal metric tensor (g^(-1)) is needed to compute the interplanar distance. The formula for d is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h²/g11) + (k²/g22) + (l²/g33) - 2hk/(g12) - 2hl/(g13) - 2kl/(g23) ) )

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = 1 / sqrt( h² g11 + k² g22 + l² g33 + 2hk g12 + 2hl g13 + 2kl g23 )

Wait, no, I think it's the other way around. Let me look up the precise formula.

Ah, I think the correct formula for the interplanar distance is:

1/d² = (h²/l²)(g11) + (k²/l²)(g22) + (l²/l²)(g33) - 2hk/(l²) g12 - 2hl/(l²) g13 - 2kl/(l²) g23 )

Wait, no, that's not correct. Alternatively, I should compute the reciprocal of the dot product of the plane normal vector with itself.

Wait, the plane is (hkl), so the normal vector is along (h, k, l) in reciprocal space. So the interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the magnitude of this vector in reciprocal space.

Wait, the reciprocal space (reciprocal lattice) vectors are given by the metric tensor. The magnitude squared of the reciprocal vector is (h² g11 + k² g22 + l² g33 - 2 h k g12 - 2 h l g13 - 2 k l g23)).

Wait, no, I think the reciprocal lattice vector components are (h, k, l) in reciprocal space, and their metric is defined by the reciprocal of the original metric.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the reciprocal of the metric tensor, then compute the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of (h², k², l²) multiplied by the reciprocal metric tensor elements.

Wait, this might be getting too complicated, but perhaps I can proceed step by step.

First, calculate the reciprocal of the metric tensor. Let me denote the metric tensor as G, and its inverse as G⁻¹.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the inverse of G. Since G is a 3x3 matrix, its inverse will have elements that can be computed using the adjugate matrix divided by the determinant.

But this might be time-consuming. Let me think if there's a smarter way.

Wait, for a rhombohedral system with a = b = c = a0 and α = β = γ = θ, we can find a simplified form for the reciprocal metric tensor.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the reciprocal lattice vectors for a rhombohedral system have a certain symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral crystal.

Wait, I found a formula somewhere that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is:

d_{hkl} = a0 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, that's similar to what I thought before. But in that case, when θ=90°, cosθ=0, and it reduces to d = a0 / sqrt(h^2 +k^2 +l^2), which matches the cubic case.

But in our case, θ=30°, which makes cosθ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So plugging in h=k=l=1:

d = 10 / sqrt(3 - 2*(1 + 1 + 1) * 0.8660 )

Wait, because 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ → 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) * cos30 = 2*(3)*0.8660 = 6*0.8660 =5.196.

So the denominator inside the sqrt is 3 -5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, that's negative. That's impossible because you can't take the square root of a negative number. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Hmm, perhaps the formula is actually:

d = a0 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, but that gives 3 - 2*(3)*0.866 = 3 - 5.196= -2.196. Negative, which is impossible.

Which suggests that either the formula is wrong, or I'm using it incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the angle as 180 - theta? Because sometimes in crystallography, the angles are measured in a way that cosθ may be negative if the angle is greater than 90 degrees. But in this case, theta is 30 degrees, so cos is positive.

Hmm. Maybe I should double-check where I got this formula from. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the structure factor.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance can be found using the formula involving the reciprocal lattice vectors. The formula for d is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) ) * (a/(sqrt(1 + ... )) )

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck because I don't remember the exact formula. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps I should construct the reciprocal lattice vectors. The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) * (1, 1, 1) / |(1,1,1)|

Wait, no, that can't be right because the actual vectors depend on the metric tensor.

Alternatively, the reciprocal lattice vectors satisfy the relation:

b_i · a_j = δ_ij,

where a_j are the lattice vectors.

But perhaps this is getting too involved.

Wait, perhaps I can find the interplanar distance using the formula:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha) } } \cdot \frac{1}{a} }

Wait, but no, that doesn't make sense because units would be inverse length.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d^2 = \frac{1}{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha) }

Wait, but that would give d in inverse angstroms. No, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha) } }

But again, with the same issue.

Wait, with a=10, h=k=l=1, and all angles 30 degrees.

So inside the sqrt: 3 - 2*(1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30 )

Which is 3 - 2*(3 * cos30 )

3 * cos30 = 3* (√3/2) ≈ 2.598.

Multiply by 2: 5.196.

So 3-5.196 = -2.196.

That's negative, which doesn't make sense. So that suggests that either the formula is wrong, or the assumption that a=10 is the lattice parameter is incorrect.

Wait, wait, but the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance is not the lattice parameter a, but something else. Because in a rhombohedral structure, the distance between atoms is not along the lattice vectors. Oh, because the atoms are at the vertices of the rhombohedral cell, but perhaps the actual interatomic distance is different.

Wait, wait, in a simple cubic structure, the lattice parameter a is the interatomic distance. But in a rhombohedral structure, which is a type of close-packed structure, perhaps the interatomic distance is a different length.

Wait, for example, in a face-centered cubic or hexagonal close-packed structure, the interatomic distance is a√2/2 or something like that. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the unit cell. In a simple cubic structure, each atom is at the corner of the cube, and the nearest neighbor distance is a√1, since each edge is a.

In a rhombohedral structure, which is a cubic structure with all edges equal and angles not 90 degrees, the nearest neighbor distance is a√2 or something else?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: in a rhombohedral structure, the distance between nearest neighbors would be along the face diagonals or some other direction, depending on the angles.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is given as the distance between neighboring atoms along a certain direction, say, the edge direction, so a would be the edge length, but in reality, the nearest neighbor distance could be a different function of a and the angles.

But the question states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps a is not equal to the interatomic distance. That complicates things because in that case, I need to find a in terms of the interatomic distance.

Wait, that's a possibility. Let me clarify: in a rhombohedral crystal, the unit cell has a certain edge length a, but the interatomic distance (say, the nearest neighbor distance) is not necessarily a. So perhaps the interatomic distance is along a certain direction, like (1,1,0), and the edge a is different.

But I don't know the exact relationship. So this complicates things because I don't know what a should be in terms of the given interatomic distance.

Wait, wait. Maybe another approach: perhaps the interatomic distance is the edge length of the unit cell. So a=10 Angstrom. Then, the problem arises where the formula gives a negative value inside the sqrt, which is impossible.

So perhaps I must have made a mistake in the formula. Another thought: perhaps the correct formula is:

d^2 = \frac{1}{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma)} } \times \frac{1}{a^2}

Wait, but that would give d in inverse angstroms, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma) } } \times \frac{1}{a}

But then, for a=10, h=k=l=1, and angles=30 degrees.

So inside the sqrt: 3 - 2*(3 * cos30) = 3 - 5.196= -2.196. So sqrt of negative is not possible.

This suggests that either the formula is incorrect, or the setup is impossible. But the problem provides the options, so my approach must be wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is different. Perhaps I should have a positive term inside the sqrt.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / \sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma) }

Wait, but that would be for angles greater than 90 degrees, making cos negative and thereby possibly positive in the sum.

Wait, let's try that.

Using h=k=l=1, a=10, angles 30 degrees.

So inside the sqrt: 3 + 2*(3 * cos30) =3 + 2*(3 * 0.8660) =3 + 5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863.

So d=10 / 2.863 ≈3.49 Angstrom. But that's not one of the options, so something's wrong.

Hmm, but the options are around 9-10 Angstrom. So maybe this approach is incorrect.

Another thought: perhaps I should be using the conventional formula for a rhombohedral system, which is:

d = a / \sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos θ }

Wait, but that's the same as before. So with theta=30 degrees, cos theta=0.866.

So denominator sqrt(3 - 2*(3)*0.866 )=sqrt(3 - 5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible.

So perhaps the interatomic distance is not the same as 'a' in the formula. Maybe I'm getting the definitions wrong.

Wait, perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance (nearest neighbor distance) is not simply 'a' but a different value. Let me think: in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a√1 = a. In a face-centered cubic, it's a√2 /2. Wait, no, in fcc, nearest neighbor is a√2/2? Or a√2 over something else.

Wait, no, correction: In fcc, each atom has 12 nearest neighbors, and the distance is a√2 /2. Because the atoms are at the cube's face centers. The distance between two adjacent face centers is sqrt( (a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2 )= a√2/2.

Similarly, in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance may be along a different direction, perhaps along (1,1,1), but I'm not sure.

Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the conventional unit cell vectors are a, b, c with a=b=c and angles α=β=γ=θ.

The interatomic distance would be the minimum distance between any two lattice points. So, for (1,1,1), the vector would be a + b + c. The length of this vector is sqrt( a² + b² + c² + 2ab cos gamma + 2ac cos beta + 2bc cos alpha ).

Since a=b=c= a0, and alpha=beta=gamma=theta=30 degrees.

So, vector length squared is 3 a0² + 2 a0² (3 cos theta)

Because:

a² + b² + c² =3 a0²

2ab cos gamma = 2a0² cos theta,

Same for 2ac cos beta, and 2bc cos alpha.

So total is 3a0² + 3*(2 a0² cos theta) )=3a0² (1 + 2 cos theta )

So, the length is a0 sqrt( 3(1 + 2 cos theta ) )

But the problem states that the interatomic distance is 10 A. So,

10 = a0 sqrt( 3(1 + 2 cos theta ) )

theta is30 degrees, cos theta= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

Compute inside the square root:

3*(1 + 2*(0.866)) =3*(1 + 1.732 )=3*(2.732)=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863.

So 10 = a0 * 2.863 → a0=10 /2.863 ≈3.493 Angstrom.

So, a is approximately 3.493 A.

Now, with a=3.493 A, I can compute the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, but wait, the (111) plane's interplanar distance is given by the formula:

d_{111} = a0 / sqrt(3 - 2*(3 cos theta)) )

But wait, earlier that approach gave a negative under the sqrt. However, perhaps the correct approach is to use a0 as the interatomic distance, which we just found.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me re-express.

The interplanar distance for (hkl) is given by:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\alpha) } }

In our case, for (111):

d = a / sqrt(3 - 2*(3 cos 30°) )

But with a=3.493 A.

Wait, but when I plug this in, the denominator becomes sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible. So that suggests that perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the conventional formula with a being the lattice parameter, but then the interatomic distance is calculated as per the vectors.

But I'm getting stuck in circles. Let me try an alternative approach.

Since the interatomic distance is given as 10 A, which is the nearest neighbor distance, which for rhombohedral is along the (1,1,1) direction. So, the vector (1,1,1) has length 10 A.

Thus, the lattice parameter a is given by the magnitude of the (1,1,1) vector in the lattice.

In a rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors are a, b, c, each with magnitude a0, and the angles between them theta.

The magnitude of the vector (1,1,1) is sqrt( a² + b² + c² + 2ab cos gamma + 2ac cos beta + 2 bc cos alpha )

Since a = b = c = a0, and all angles are theta =30 degrees.

So, magnitude squared is 3 a0² + 2 a0² (3 cos theta ) =3 a0² (1 + 2 cos theta )

Given that this equals (10)^2=100,

3 a0² (1 + 2 cos 30° ) = 100.

So,

a0² = 100 / [3 (1 + 2*(sqrt(3)/2) ) ]

Compute denominator: 3*(1 + sqrt(3)) )=3*(1+1.732)=3*2.732=8.196

So,

a0²= 100 /8.196 ≈12.2 → a0≈3.49 A.

So, a0 is approximately 3.49 A.

Now, to find the interplanar distance d_{111}.

Using the general formula,

1/d² = (h² +k² + l²)/(a²) - 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha )/(a²)

Wait, no, perhaps I should use the formula in terms of the reciprocal lattice.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{ \sqrt{ h² + k² + l² - 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha ) } }

But wait, with a=3.493 A, and h=k=l=1.

So,

Denominator inside sqrt:1+1+1 - 2*(1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30 +1*1 * cos30 )

=3 - 2*(3 * 0.866)

=3-5.196= -2.196.

Again, negative, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, maybe I should invert the angles or something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{ \sqrt{ h² +k² + l² + 2 ( hk \cos \gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha ) } }

In this case,

Denominator:3 + 2*(3 * 0.866 )= 3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=3.493 /2.863≈1.22 A.

But none of the options are near 1A. So something is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let's try another approach.

The interplanar distance d(hkl) in a crystal is given by:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ [h^2 (1/a^2) (1 - cos² alpha) ] + similar terms for k and l } }

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell parameters.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula:

1/d² = (h² +k² + l²)/(a²) - (hk (cos gamma ) + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha )/(a²)

Which would be:

1/d² = [ (3) - (3 * cos30 ) ]/a²

= [3-3*(√3/2) ] / a²

= [3(1 - (√3/2) ) ] / a²

= [3*(2 -√3)/2 ] / a²

= 3*(2-√3)/(2 a² )

So,

d = sqrt( 2 a² / [3 (2 -√3) ] )

With a=3.493,

Compute denominator: 3*(2 -1.732)=3*(0.268)=0.804.

So,

d= sqrt( 2*(3.493)^2 /0.804 )

Compute numerator: 2*(3.493)^2 ≈2*12.2≈24.4.

24.4 /0.804 =30.32.

sqrt(30.32)=5.506 A.

But the options are around 9 A, so this doesn't match. I must be doing something wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for d is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

But again, when theta=30, that leads to a negative denominator.

Hmm. Maybe the formula is actually designed for angles larger than 90 degrees, so the cos theta is negative, which would make the term inside positive. But in this case, theta=30, which is less than 90, leading to a negative inside.

Which suggests that the (111) plane might not be allowed in this structure, but the problem provides the option, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula uses the angle between the lattice vectors as 30 degrees, but the angle used in the formula is 180-30=150 degrees, which has a cosine of -√3/2.

So, plugging cos theta = -√3/2 ≈-0.866.

So, denominator inside sqrt:

3 - 2*(3*(-0.866))=3 - (2*3*(-0.866))=3 +5.196=8.196.

So, denominator is sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So, d= a /2.863.

With a=10 A,

d=10 /2.863≈3.493 A.

But the options are about 9 A. So that's not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should have cos(180-theta), which is -cos(theta). So,

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos(180-30) )

= a/sqrt(3 - 2*(3) * (-0.866) )

= a/sqrt(3 +5.196 )=a/sqrt(8.196)=a/2.863.

Again, a=10 → d=3.493 A, which is not among the options.

Wait, but the given interatomic distance is 10 A, which perhaps is not the same as a.

Wait, perhaps a is the lattice parameter, and the interatomic distance (nearest neighbor) is a times some factor.

In a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is along the (111) direction, which has magnitude sqrt(3 a² + 6 a² cos theta ). So,

nearest neighbor distance (d_nn) = a * sqrt( 3 + 6 cos theta )

So,

d_nn = a * sqrt(3 + 6 cos theta )

We are given d_nn =10 A.

So,

10 = a * sqrt(3 +6*(√3/2) )

= a * sqrt(3 +3√3 )

Compute 3√3 ≈5.196, so 3+5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So,

a=10 /2.863≈3.493 A.

Now, having a=3.493 A, compute d_{111}.

Using the correct formula, perhaps.

The formula for interplanar distance is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

But in this case, all angles are 30 degrees.

So,

denominator inside sqrt:

3 - 2*(3 * cos30 )

=3 - 2*3*0.866=3-5.196= -2.196.

Negative, which is impossible. So, perhaps this formula is incorrect.

Alternative approach: perhaps I should use the conventional formula for the interatomic distance in the (111) plane.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a0 / sqrt( h² +k² + l² )

But in this case, a0 being the lattice parameter, which is 3.493 A.

But for (111), h=k=l=1, so d=3.493 / sqrt(3)=3.493 /1.732≈2 A. Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different for a rhombohedral structure.

Wait, perhaps for a rhombohedral structure, the interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta } }

But again, with theta=30°, this gives negative.

Alternatively, suppose the angles are 180-30=150°, so cos theta =-0.866.

Then denominator:

3 - 2*(3) * (-0.866 )=3 +5.196=8.196.

So,

d=3.493 / sqrt(8.196 )=3.493 /2.863≈1.22 A.

Still not matching the options.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect, and the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h² +k² + l²) - 2(hk \cos\alpha + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\gamma) } }

But again, with alpha=beta=gamma=30°, this leads to 3-5.196= -2.196, which is impossible.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the angle as 60°, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the given angles are 30°, but the formula uses the angle between the crystallographic axes as 60°, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a/(sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta )) 

Then, with theta=30°,

denominator=3 + 2*(3)*(0.866)=3+5.196=8.196 → sqrt=2.863.

d=3.493 /2.863≈1.22 A.

Still doesn't match the options.

Wait, but the options are around 9 A. So perhaps I'm using the wrong a value.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is a itself. So a=10 A.

Then, using the formula,

d= a / sqrt(3 - 2*(3 cos 30 )) → denominator sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible.

So, that can't be. So perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps the formula is written in terms of the unit cell vectors, which are a, b, c, and the angles between them.

The formula for interplanar distance in terms of a, b, c, and angles is:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2/a^2)(1/(sin^2 theta/2)) + (k^2/b^2)(1/(sin^2 phi/2)) + (l^2/c^2)(1/(sin^2 psi/2)) - ... something with cross terms } }

Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a formula specific to rhombohedral crystals.

Wait, I found a resource that states that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) \cos \theta } }

Which brings me back to the same problem. So, with a=10, theta=30°, the denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible. So the conclusion is that the (111) plane doesn't exist in this structure, but the problem states that it does, so maybe I've made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are 180-30=150°, which has a cos of -0.866. Then,

denominator: 3 -2*(3*(-0.866))=3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So, d= a/2.863. If a=10, then d=3.493 A.

But the options are around 9. So this is not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d= a * sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2 (hk cos theta + ... )).

Wait, no, that would give a larger value.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the spacing in the reciprocal lattice.

The reciprocal space vector for (111) is (1,1,1) in reciprocal space, and the length is sqrt( 3 ) * ( a/(sqrt(3(1 + 2 cos theta )) ) )

Wait, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is given by:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \theta } }

So, with theta=30°, this gives 3 +5.196=8.196.

a=10 → d=10 /2.863≈3.493 A. Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the options given. The options are:

A)9.08, B)8.95, C)9.54, D)10.05.

These are all around 9 A. So perhaps the interplanar distance is approximately 9 A. How can I get that?

Wait, going back to the initial approach, perhaps the formula uses the unit vectors in a different way.

Assume a=10 A, angles 30°, then the denominator is sqrt(3 - 2*(3 * cos30 )) → sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible.

So to get a positive value under the square root, perhaps the formula has a plus instead of a minus.

Trying with a plus:

d= a / sqrt(3 + 5.196)=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.493 A.

No, not 9A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the unit cell's volume.

Wait, the volume of the rhombohedral unit cell is a³ * sqrt(1 -3 cos theta + 3 cos^2 theta ).

Wait, in this case, a=10 A, theta=30°, cos theta=0.866.

Volume V=1000 * sqrt(1 -3*(0.866) +3*(0.866)^2 )

Compute inside sqrt:

1 -2.598 +3*(0.75) → 1-2.598+2.25= (1+2.25) -2.598=3.25-2.598=0.652.

So V=1000 * sqrt(0.652)=1000 * 0.8075≈807.5 A³.

But I don't see how that helps in finding d.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the interplanar distance is calculated using the face diagonal.

But in a rhombohedral structure, the (111) plane is not a face diagonal. So perhaps this approach won't work.

Wait, perhaps the (111) plane is a hexagon, and the interplanar distance refers to the distance between adjacent planes in that hexagon. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the interplanar distance using the formula for a hexagonal crystal, but since rhombohedral is part of the cubic system, perhaps it's not applicable.

Wait, the hexagonal system uses a different formula for interplanar distance, but I'm not sure about rhombohedral.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is using the conventional formula for a cubic system, ignoring the angles, which would give d=10/sqrt(3)=5.773 A, which is not close to the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question considers the rhombohedral crystal as a simple cubic, leading to d=10/sqrt(3)≈5.77 A, which again doesn't match.

Hmm. Maybe I should compute the inverse of the interatomic spacing using the conventional cubic formula, but I don't see how that would help.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is along a different direction, but it's unclear.

At this point, I'm stuck. I think I need to consider that perhaps in the rhombohedral crystal, the (111) plane's interplanar distance is calculated using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

But in this case, a is the interatomic distance, which is 10 A.

So,

d=10 / sqrt(3 - 2*(3 * cos30 ))=10 / sqrt(3 -5.196)= sqrt(-2.196).

Which is impossible, so perhaps the correct answer is not possible with the given parameters. But since the problem provides options, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the formula is incorrect, and the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

Then,

d=10 / sqrt(3 +5.196)=10/2.863≈3.493 A.

No, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos theta) )

But I don't know where that comes from.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles in the formula are measured differently. For example, if the angles between the crystallographic axes are 30°, but the formula expects the angles between the vectors as 150°, perhaps.

So,

cos theta = cos(150° )= -√3/2.

Denominator inside sqrt:3 -2*(3*(-√3/2 ))=3 +3√3≈3+5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863 → d= a/2.863=10/2.863≈3.493 A.

Still not matching the options.

I'm really stuck here. The options suggest a d around 9 A, but all approaches I've tried give d around 3-5 A. I must have made a fundamental mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is not along (1,1,1) but along a different direction, such as (1,0,0), which is the edge direction.

So, the vector (1,0,0) has length a0, which is the interatomic distance of 10 A.

So, a0=10 A.

Now, compute d_{111}.

Using the formula:

d= a0 / sqrt(3 - 2*(3 cos theta )) → again, negative.

Which is impossible.

Alternatively, using the corrected formula where theta is 150°, cos theta=-0.866:

d=10 / sqrt(3 +5.196)=10/2.863≈3.493 A.

No match.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the interplanar distance using the conventional cubic formula, assuming the angles are 90°, but with a=10 A.

So,

d=10/sqrt(3)=5.773 A.

Still not matching the options.

Alternative idea: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the interatomic distance in a hexagonal close-packed structure, which has a different formula.

But the question states it's a rhombohedral crystal, so that's probably not applicable.

Hmm. I'm out of ideas. Based on the options, perhaps the correct answer is approximately 9.08 Angstrom (option A), but I'm not sure how to reach it.

Wait, perhaps the formula should have a plus instead of a minus, and a0=10 A.

Then,

d=10 / sqrt(3 +5.196)=10/2.863≈3.493 A. No, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

But with a0 being the interatomic distance along (1,1,1), which is 10 A.

Wait, but earlier calculation showed that a0= interatomic distance along (1,1,1) is 10 A, which gives a lattice parameter a=3.493 A.

So, using a=3.493 A,

d=3.493 / sqrt(3 -5.196)= impossible.

Hmm. Perhaps the correct answer is option A)9.08 A, but I can't see how to get there.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d_{111} \) for a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Å and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma)}}
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Given Parameters**:
   - Interatomic distance: \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \)
   - Angles: \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \)
   - Miller indices: \( h = k = l = 1 \)

2. **Substitute Values**:
   - \( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3 \)
   - \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \)
   - The second term in the denominator becomes:
     \[
     2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma) = 2(3 \cdot 0.866) = 5.196
     \]

3. **Compute Denominator**:
   - Inside the square root:
     \[
     3 - 5.196 = -2.196
     \]
   - This results in a negative value under the square root, which is physically impossible.

4. **Revisiting the Formula**:
   - The formula may implicitly assume that the angles are \( 180^\circ - 30^\circ = 150^\circ \), where \( \cos 150^\circ = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx -0.866 \). Substituting this:
     \[
     3 - 2(3 \cdot -0.866) = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196
     \]
   - The denominator becomes:
     \[
     \sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863
     \]

5. **Calculate \( d_{111} \)**:
   - Using \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \):
     \[
     d_{111} = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.493 \, \text{Å}
     \]
   - This result does not match the provided options, suggesting a potential misinterpretation of the interatomic distance or the formula.

6. **Alternative Interpretation**:
   - If the interatomic distance corresponds to the nearest-neighbor distance along the \( (1,1,1) \) direction, the lattice parameter \( a \) must be recalculated. The magnitude of the \( (1,1,1) \) vector is:
     \[
     \sqrt{3a^2 + 6a^2 \cos 30^\circ} = 10
     \]
     Solving for \( a \):
     \[
     a \approx 3.493 \, \text{Å}
     \]
   - Substituting \( a = 3.493 \, \text{Å} \) into the formula still yields an interplanar distance inconsistent with the options.

7. **Final Consideration**:
   - The options provided (9.08, 8.95, 9.54, 10.05 Å) suggest that the correct answer is approximately \( 9.08 \, \text{Å} \). However, the detailed calculations do not directly yield this value, indicating a possible issue with the interpretation of the interatomic distance or the formula.

### Conclusion:
Based on the reasoning and the provided options, the most plausible answer is:

**Answer: A**
