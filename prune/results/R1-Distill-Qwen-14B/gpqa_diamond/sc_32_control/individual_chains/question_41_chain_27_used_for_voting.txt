Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. The question states that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the lab. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, so let me think. I remember from my studies that the speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the medium, right? Because if the medium is moving, things get more complicated. Oh right, this must involve some kind of relativity or velocity addition.

Wait, but the speed of light in a medium is always less than c, right? So if the glass is moving, does that affect how we perceive the speed of the light in it?

Hmm, but wait, in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the light's speed in the glass's frame is c/n in the direction of propagation. But from the lab frame, I need to apply the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

Oh wait, but wait—if the medium is moving, does that affect the speed of light in that medium? Because in special relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame is always c. But wait, in a medium, the speed is c/n, but I'm not sure how that plays into it when the medium is moving.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me consider the medium's rest frame first. In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is (1/n) c, right? Because n is the index of refraction. So the light is moving at v_light = c/n in the same direction as the glass is moving.

Now, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. So I need to find the speed of the light in the lab frame. Using the velocity addition formula from special relativity, which is:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c²))

Wait, but wait. u is the velocity of the light in the medium's frame. So in the medium's frame (glass), the light's velocity is u = c/n. So substituting into the formula:

u' = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator: (1 + (v)/(n c) )

So u' = [ (c + n v) / n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ]

Wait, let me compute the denominator. The denominator is 1 + (u v)/(c²) = 1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² = 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v) / (n c )

So,

u' = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ]

Dividing fractions: numerator * reciprocal of denominator.

So,

u' = [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n in the numerator and denominator cancel out.

So u' = [ (c + n v) * c ] / (n c + v )

Wait, let's factor out n from denominator: n c + v = n (c) + v. Hmm.

Wait, but let's see. The numerator is c(c + n v) = c^2 + c n v.

The denominator is n c + v.

Wait, can I factor this? Let me see:

Wait, denominator is v + n c = n(c) + v.

So the expression is [c^2 + c n v ] / (n c + v )

Hmm, but I can factor c from numerator and denominator:

Numerator: c(c + n v )

Denominator: n c + v = c (n) + v.

Wait, not sure if that's helpful. Let's see if I can factor anything else.

Wait, the numerator is c ( c + n v ), denominator is (n c + v ). Hmm, maybe I can factor n c + v as (c n + v ), which is same as denominator.

Wait, but maybe I can rearrange the numerator and denominator.

Wait, the numerator is c(c +n v) = c^2 + c n v.

Denominator is n c + v.

So,

u' = [c^2 + c n v ] / (n c + v )

Hmm, perhaps factor out c from denominator.

Wait, denominator is c(n) + v = c (n) + v.

Wait, perhaps factor out c: denominator = c (n + v/c )

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, let's factor n from denominator.

Wait, perhaps the expression can be written as c * (c + n v) / (n c + v )

But I'm not sure that's helpful. Let's think about the options given.

The options are:

A) (1 +n v)/(n +v )

B) 1

C) (1 +n v)/(n -v )

D) (1 -n v)/(n +v )

Wait, but our expression is [c^2 + c n v ] / (n c + v )

Since the speed of light in vacuum is taken as c=1. So, substituting c=1, the expression becomes:

u' = [1 + n v ] / (n + v )

Ah, that's exactly option A's numerator and denominator.

So, the speed is (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is option A.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Because I used the velocity addition formula, but is that applicable here? Because in the medium's frame, light is moving at u=1/n. Then, the lab frame is moving at velocity -v relative to the medium. So, I used the velocity addition formula for u in medium's frame to find u' in lab frame.

Yes, that's correct. So the final expression is (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is option A.

But wait, another way to think about this: when the medium is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the medium. So in the lab frame, the medium is moving towards the observer (so velocity v is towards the observer). And the light is moving in the same direction as the medium's velocity.

Wait, but when the medium is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in that same direction, perhaps their velocities add. But considering relativistic effects, the addition isn't just simple vector addition.

Alternatively, if the medium were stationary, the light speed is 1/n. But if the medium is moving, the lab frame sees the light moving at (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c^2 ), which is the relativistic addition formula.

So yes, same conclusion as before.

To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we start by noting that the speed of light in a medium is given by \( v_{\text{light}} = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum and \( n \) is the index of refraction. However, since the glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) relative to the laboratory, we must account for relativistic velocity addition.

In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( \frac{c}{n} \). Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

we substitute \( u = \frac{c}{n} \) (the speed of light in the glass's frame) and \( v \) (the velocity of the glass relative to the lab). Substituting these values:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right)v}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right)v}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{v}{n c}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n c}}
\]

Multiply numerator and denominator by \( n c \) to simplify:

\[
u' = \frac{c^2 + n v c}{n c + v}
\]

Since \( c = 1 \), this simplifies to:

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
\frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]
