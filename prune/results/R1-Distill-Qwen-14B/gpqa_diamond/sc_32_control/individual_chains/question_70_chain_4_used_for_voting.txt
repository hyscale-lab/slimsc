Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to think it through. The question is about figuring out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, symmetry groups, right? I remember they're related to the shapes of molecules and their point groups. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so let me break it down step by step.

First, the problem describes a series of reactions. Let me parse each reaction to figure out what the substances could be. Maybe if I can identify A, B, C, D, and E, that will help me figure out what E is, and then determine its symmetry.

The first reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Okay, so 8 equivalents mean the stoichiometry is 1 A : 8 B. What's a solid reacting with a gas in an 8:1 ratio? Hmm. One possibility is that A is an element and B is a diatomic gas. For example, maybe A is sulfur and B is oxygen. Sulfur burning in oxygen would form SO3, but wait, sulfur and oxygen combining to form something red? Alternatively, if A is copper and B is oxygen, but copper oxide isn't bright red. Wait, wait, what's bright red? Oh, maybe lead oxide? No, that's more yellow. Oh! I remember something about lead dioxide, PbO2, which is dark brown. Hmm. Or maybe it's something else.

Wait, another thought: Could A be sodium or another metal reacting with something? Not sure. Maybe A is Fe, but iron(III) oxide is reddish, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is phosphorus reacting with something. If A is P (solid), and B is Cl2 gas. Oh wait, P and Cl2 can react to form PCl5. But wait, PCl5 is a solid and is used as a catalyst, but is it bright red? I'm not certain about the color. Alternatively, maybe it's lead reacting with something else.

Wait, another possibility: Could A be FeS and B be Cl2? FeS reacting with Cl2 might form FeCl3 and S, but that doesn't fit the 8 equivalents. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the reaction is with O2. Like if A is solid, maybe it's a metal oxide. For example, Cu and O2 forming CuO? No, that's black. What about lead (Pb) reacting with oxygen? PbO is yellow, PbO2 is dark brown. Hmm, not matching the bright red.

Oh, wait! Maybe it's not a metal. Could A be a compound and B be another gas? Another thought: What if A is carbon (solid) and B is something else? Carbon with O2 would form CO or CO2, but that doesn't fit the 8 equivalents. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal and B is chlorine. For example, Na and Cl2 to form NaCl. But 8 equivalents would imply something like 4 moles of NaCl per mole of Na, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about other bright red compounds. Oh! Maybe C is something like mercury(II) oxide, HgO, but it's red. Wait, but mercury is a liquid, not a solid. Hmm. Alternatively, could C be a chromium compound? Chromium(VI) compounds like K2Cr2O7 are orange, but not bright red. Maybe it's something else.

Wait, another angle: When C reacts with water, it reforms A and produces two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So C must be a salt that, when hydrolyzed, gives two different acids. Hmm. Like a salt with two different anions? Or maybe it's a metal sulfide that reacts with water to produce H2S and another acid. Wait, but H2S is a weak acid, and if another acid is strong, maybe something else.

Wait, maybe C is a nitride? For example, if C is Ca3N2, when it reacts with water, it forms NH3 (a weak base) and Ca(OH)2, which is a base. No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, could C be an acidic salt, like a sulfite or something else.

Alternatively, think about metal oxides. If C is a metal oxide that when reacted with water gives a strong acid and another acid. Wait, but most metal oxides are either basic or neutral. Hmm. Wait, maybe C is a salt of a weak base and a strong acid. For example, NH4NO3, but when it reacts with water, it doesn't produce acids; it's already a nitrate and ammonium.

Wait, perhaps when C reacts with water, it breaks down into A plus F and G. So A is the original solid, which could be an element. For example, if C is a compound that upon hydrolysis gives back A and two acids. So maybe the original reaction was A + B → C. Then when C + H2O → A + F + G.

So, if F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. Let's think about that. Let's say C is a salt that, upon hydrolysis, produces a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, maybe C is something like (NH4)2SO4. When hydrolyzed, it could produce NH4OH (which is weak) and H2SO4 (strong). But wait, the original reaction would have to form (NH4)2SO4 from A and B. That might not fit.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a sulfite salt. For example, if A is sodium (Na), B is SO3 (but that's a gas?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about the reaction D reacting with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. D and B in 1:1 ratio. B is a gas. What solvents are formed from such reactions? For example, D could be H2O and B could be something else, but not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's suppose that product E is very hazardous. What are some extremely hazardous chemicals? Maybe something like sarin gas or other nerve agents, but that's probably not relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like phosgene, but not sure.

Wait, let's think about the second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. So, the stoichiometry is C + 2 D → E. If D is a gas, perhaps D is H2O, but then E would be something formed from C and water. Wait, no, because earlier, C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. So maybe D is a different gas.

Wait, in the first reaction, B is a gas, and in the second, D is a gas. So B and D are different gases. Let's think about possible gas reactions.

Wait, the reaction of D with B in a 1:1 ratio forms H, which is a solvent. So D and B react to form a solvent. Solvents include water, ethanol, methanol, etc. So if B is O2, then D could be something else. Alternatively, B is Cl2, D is something else. Wait, if B is Cl2 and D is H2O, but in that case, their reaction might produce HCl and O2, but that wouldn't be a solvent. Alternatively, if B is H2O and D is something else? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another solvent is H2O itself. So if H is H2O, then D and B would have to react to form H2O. That would imply that D and B are something that when combined make water. For example, if B is H2 and D is O2, but then their reaction would be 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So that's a 2:1 ratio, but the problem says D and B react in a 1:1 ratio. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe H is something like ethanol. Then D and B would have to be something that can form ethanol. For example, D could be O2 and B be CO, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe D is a diatomic gas, like O2 or Cl2, and B is another gas. Hmm.

Let me try to think about the possible structures of E and its symmetry group. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. These are all point groups.

D∞h suggests a linear molecule with a center of inversion and multiple mirror planes. For example, CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. But wait, CO2 is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. But wait, if E is a linear molecule, then D∞h could be the answer. Alternatively, if E has a C2v symmetry, that's a point group with a C2 axis and two mirror planes at 45 degrees (like H2O).

Wait, but what if E is a molecule like SO2? No, SO2 has a bent structure with C2v symmetry. Alternatively, if E is O3 (ozone), which is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry. Hmm, but O3 is a gas, but I'm not sure if it's extremely hazardous.

Alternatively, if E is a tetrahedral molecule, like CH4, which has Td symmetry, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, if E is a trigonal planar molecule like BF3, which has D3h symmetry, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps E is something like SO3, which is trigonal pyramidal? No, SO3 is actually a trigonal planar molecule with D3h symmetry. Hmm, but none of the options match that.

Wait, but let me get back to the reactions. Let's think about what E could be. The first reaction is A + 8 B → C. So maybe A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas, like O2. Let's say A is Pb (lead) and B is O2. Then, Pb + O2 → PbO2? Lead(IV) oxide is dark brown, but the product C is bright red. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, A is Fe and B is S (solid sulfur), but that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait another angle: The reaction of C with water produces A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak one. Let's think about F and G. Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak acids include HClO, H2CO3, H3PO4, etc.

So perhaps when C is hydrolyzed, it produces a strong acid (like H2SO4) and a weak acid (like H2CO3). Wait, but that would mean C is a sulfite or something else.

Wait, another thought: If C is a salt like (NH4)2SO4, which upon hydrolysis gives NH4OH (a weak acid) and H2SO4 (strong). But how would (NH4)2SO4 form from A and B?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if A is sodium (Na), B is N2 gas, but that doesn't fit the 8 equivalents.

Wait, maybe A is a metal and B is Cl2 gas. Let's say A is Mg, reacting with Cl2 to form MgCl2. But that's a 1:1 ratio. Doesn't fit 8 equivalents.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is with O2. For example, if A is Pb and B is O2, then Pb + O2 → PbO2, which is dark brown. But the product C is bright red, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps A is Fe and B is O2. Fe reacts with O2 to form Fe3O4, which is black, not red.

Wait, another idea: What if A is a metal and B is Cl2, and the product C is a chlorinated metal, but the reaction forms a compound that, when hydrolyzed, gives a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait, perhaps C is sodium chlorate (NaClO3). When it reacts with water, it might decompose, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a mixture of salts.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the second reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. So it's a 1:2 ratio. What if D is H2O? Then C + 2 H2O → E. If E is a product formed by adding water to C, perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction.

Wait, but if C is a sulfite (like Na2SO3), adding water might not change much. Alternatively, if C is a nitride (like Na3N), adding water would produce NH3 and NaOH. But then E would be something else.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2SO4, but then E would be something else. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: The first reaction uses 8 equivalents of gas B. So the formula of C would likely have 8 B atoms per A. Let's say B is O2. Then each O2 molecule has 2 O atoms, so 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of O2 reacting with 1 mole of A. So for A + 8 O2 → C. So the formula of C would likely be A O16? Or perhaps A is in a higher oxidation state.

Wait, but that seems too high. For example, if A is Pb, Pb has a common oxidation state of +4. So Pb + 8 O2 would be PbO4? No, PbO3 is lead trioxide, which is not common. Alternatively, perhaps PbO2 is lead dioxide, which is Pb in +4 oxidation state. So PbO2 has the formula PbO2, which would be 1 Pb, 2 O. So that would need 1 mole of O2 per mole of Pb, but the reaction requires 8 moles of O2. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe B is O2, and the reaction is A + 8 O2 → A O8? That seems unlikely, as most elements don't form such high oxidation states.

Wait, perhaps B isn't O2. What if B is Cl2? Then 8 moles of Cl2 would mean 16 Cl atoms per A. So the formula would be ACl16. But that's a very high number. For example, perhaps A is Fe, and the product is FeCl8? I don't think such a compound exists.

Wait, maybe A is a non-metal. For example, sulfur. If A is S (solid) reacting with Cl2 gas (B) to form SCl something. But S + Cl2 would form SCl2, SCl4, or SCl6. Wait, SCl6 is a thing, but 8 equivalents would imply 8 Cl atoms per S. So SCl8? That doesn't sound right. I'm not sure if such a compound exists.

Alternatively, maybe B is a diatomic gas like O2, and A is an element that forms an oxide with formula AO. Hmm, but 8 equivalents of O2 would give A O8? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the product E. Since E is formed when C reacts with D, which is a gas, and E is extremely hazardous, perhaps E is a gas like phosgene (COCl2), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe E is a nerve agent, which is a possibility, but I don't remember their structures.

Wait, perhaps E is a molecule with a certain symmetry. Let's say E is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, like CO2. But is CO2 extremely hazardous? No, it's a greenhouse gas but not particularly toxic. Or maybe E is something like O3 (ozone), which is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry. Ozone is toxic in high concentrations.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like SO2, which is bent with C2v symmetry and is indeed a hazardous gas.

Wait, if E is SO2, then what's its symmetry group? SO2 has a bent structure, which is similar to water. Water has C2v symmetry because it has a C2 axis (180-degree rotation), a mirror plane through the O, and another perpendicular mirror plane bisecting the H-O-H angle.

Another possibility is that E has D4h symmetry. Wait, D4h is a higher symmetry, which includes multiple planes and axes. For example, something like a square planar molecule with a center of inversion. But I can't think of a common square planar molecule that's extremely hazardous. Maybe something like CCl4, but that's not square planar. Wait, square planar is more common in coordination complexes, like Ni(CO)4, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Alternatively, what about H2O? No, H2O has C2v symmetry. So if E is H2O, but that's not extremely hazardous. But the problem says E is extremely hazardous, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, maybe E is something like HCl, which is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. HCl is a gas, but isn't that dangerous in high concentrations. Alternatively, HCl is a strong acid but not extremely hazardous in the way the question implies.

Wait, perhaps E is a molecule with C2 symmetry. For example, H2O has C2v, not C2. Alternatively, something like NO2 has C2v symmetry, I think. NO2 is a reddish-brown gas and is toxic. Let me check its structure: NO2 has a bent structure with a bond angle around 134 degrees, so it's similar to O3. So it would have C2v symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe E is O3 (ozone), which is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry. Ozone is a toxic gas, so that fits the description.

Wait, but earlier when C reacts with D to form E, what's D? If D is O2, then C + 2 O2 → E. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps D is O2, and E is O3. But O3 is formed by the reaction of O2 with something else. Wait, but ozone is formed by the reaction of O2 with UV light, not with another substance. So that may not fit.

Alternatively, D could be another gas, like F2, but that's a stretch.

Hmm, maybe I'm going about this the wrong way. Let's try to piece it all together.

First Reaction: A(s) + 8 B(g) → C(solid)

Second Reaction: C(s) + 2 D(g) → E(extremely hazardous)

Third Reaction: C(s) + H2O → A(s) + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)

Fourth Reaction: D(g) + B(g) → H (solvent), 1:1 ratio.

So, let's track what each substance could be.

From the third reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G.

F is strong acid, G is weak acid.

So, C is a salt that, when reacted with water, produces two different acids. That suggests that C is a salt of a weak base and a strong acid, or a salt with two different anions.

Wait, for example, if C is NH4NO3, then hydrolysis would produce NH4OH (weak acid) and HNO3 (strong acid). But then, how would NH4NO3 form from A and B?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. When reacted with water, it might not change much, but perhaps it's a more complex salt.

Wait, another approach: If C is a nitride, like Na3N, which upon hydrolysis would produce NH3 (weak base) and NaOH (strong base). But F and G are acids, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a carbonate. For example, CaCO3. When reacted with water, it doesn't produce acids, so that's not right.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a sulfonate ester or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a phosphate, like Ca3(PO4)2. No, that's not likely to produce acids upon hydrolysis.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide. For example, FeS. When FeS reacts with water, it doesn't hydrolyze to produce acids, but perhaps if it's a more complex sulfide.

Alternatively, maybe C is a chlorate, like KClO3. When KClO3 reacts with water, it doesn't decompose to produce strong and weak acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed salt, like KAl(SO4)2. But when it reacts with water, it would just dissociate into ions. Not producing acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate of a weak acid. Wait, but nitrate is a strong acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong acid. For example, if C is (CH3COO)2Al. When hydrolyzed, it produces acetic acid (weak) and Al(OH)3 (which is amphoteric, but not an acid). Hmm, not quite.

Alternatively, maybe C is a phosphate like Ca(H2PO4)2. When it reacts with water, it might produce H3PO4 (weak acid) and Ca(OH)2 (base). But again, not matching F and G being acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate. For example, if C is Na2SO3, but that's a sulfite. Wait, but when Na2SO3 reacts with water, it doesn't produce H2SO3 (which is a weak acid), but maybe it's more about the hydrolysis of a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate of a weak acid. For example, if C is (CH3COO)NO3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong acid. For example, if C is NaHSO4. When NaHSO4 is dissolved in water, it dissociates into Na+, H+, and SO4^2-. The H+ comes from the strong acid H2SO4, but the SO4^2- doesn't form an acid upon hydrolysis. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: Maybe C is a metal hydroxide. For example, if A is a metal, and C is its hydroxide. But then hydrolysis would not produce acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal carbonate. For example, Na2CO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't produce acids, so that's not it.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck here. Let's think about the second reaction. C reacts with 2 D → E. E is extremely hazardous. Maybe E is phosgene, which is COCl2. Phosgene is a highly toxic gas.

If E is COCl2, then what is D? Let's see: C + 2 D → COCl2.

Wait, but what's D? D is a gas that reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Let's assume H is H2O. Then D + B → H2O. So D and B are reactants that form water. If B is H2O, that can't be because H is also H2O. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is H2, then 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But that's a 2:1 ratio, but the problem states 1:1. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is H2O. But Cl2 and H2O can react to form HCl and HOCl, but that doesn't form a solvent. So that's not matching.

Wait, another possibility: B is CO2 and D is H2O. But CO2 + H2O → H2CO3, which is a weak acid, not a solvent.

Alternatively, B is NH3 and D is HCl. NH3 + HCl → NH4Cl (a salt), but that's not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe D is a diatomic gas, like F2, and B is something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps H is ethanol, so D and B could be ethylene and water? No, that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps D is a diatomic gas like O2, and B is something else. If H is H2O, then O2 + something → H2O. That would require the something to be H2, but O2 and H2 would react in a 1:1 ratio? No, their reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe H is something like CH3OH (methanol). Then D and B could be CO and H2. For example, in the hydrogenation reaction: CO + 3 H2 → CH3OH. But that's a 1:3 ratio, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe H is NH3, so D and B could be N2 and H2. But N2 + H2 → NH3 requires 3 H2 per N2, which is a 1:3 ratio, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit either.

Wait, perhaps H is something else. What about acetone (CH3COCH3)? But I'm not sure what D and B would be to form acetone in a 1:1 ratio.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to think about the possible chemical structures again.

If E is phosgene (COCl2), which is a highly toxic gas, then C + 2 D → COCl2. So D would be something that when reacted with C forms phosgene. Hmm, but I'm not sure what C would be.

Alternatively, maybe E is something like Cl2O, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the symmetry groups. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If E has D4h symmetry, it would be a molecule with a four-fold axis, mirror planes, etc. Examples include square planar molecules or octahedral molecules with certain symmetries. But I can't think of a common highly toxic gas with D4h symmetry.

If E has D∞h symmetry, it would be a linear molecule, like CO2 or HCN. CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. But is CO2 extremely hazardous? Not particularly, but maybe in high concentrations it can cause asphyxiation.

Alternatively, maybe E is a different linear molecule.

If E has C2v symmetry, it would be a bent molecule. Examples include H2O and O3. Ozone is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry and is indeed a toxic gas.

So if E is ozone (O3), then what's the reaction? O3 is formed by the reaction of O2 with UV light, but in the problem, it's formed by C + 2 D.

Wait, but how would C react with D to form O3? That seems unlikely unless C is O2 and D is some other gas, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is nitric oxide (NO), but NO has C2v symmetry? I'm not certain. Wait, NO is a linear molecule with a lone pair, but its symmetry group is D∞h because it's linear.

Wait, but NO is a free radical and has a bent structure? No, I think NO is linear. So its symmetry group would be D∞h. But is it extremely hazardous? Yes, NO is toxic.

Alternatively, E could be another molecule like SO2, which has C2v symmetry and is a toxic gas.

So putting it all together, perhaps E is ozone (O3), which has C2v symmetry. But I'm not entirely sure about the reactions leading to that.

Wait, but then C would be something that reacts with D to form O3. Alternatively, perhaps C is O2 and D is O3? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe C is O3, but then how would it form?

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think about the overall structure.

If E has D∞h symmetry, it's a linear molecule. If E is phosgene (COCl2), which is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. Phosgene is a highly toxic gas. So if E is phosgene, then C + 2 D → COCl2.

What would D be? If D is Cl2, then C would need to have two Cl atoms that can be replaced by something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe D is CO, but that's speculative.

Wait, another angle: D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If H is H2O, then perhaps D is H2O and B is something else. But that would require D and B to be H2O and another gas.

Wait, perhaps D is H2O and B is NH3. Then, NH3 + H2O → NH4OH (solvent?), but that's a 1:1 ratio. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, D could be O2 and B is H2. Then, H2 + O2 → H2O, which is a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is getting really tricky. Maybe I should try to look for the symmetry group first.

Looking back at the options:

A) C2 – a twofold rotation axis.

B) D4h – a dihedral group with four-fold rotational symmetry and a horizontal mirror plane.

C) D∞h – infinite symmetry, like a linear molecule with a center of inversion.

D) C2v – a twofold rotation axis and two mirror planes at 45 degrees.

If E is a linear molecule, then D∞h or C2v (if it's linear and has certain mirror planes).

Wait, wait. Ozone (O3) is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry. So if E is O3, the symmetry group is C2v, which is option D.

Alternatively, if E is a linear molecule, like CO2 or HCN, the symmetry group is D∞h (option C).

But the question is about E's molecular symmetry group.

So, to recap: if E is O3, symmetry is C2v. If E is CO2, symmetry is D∞h.

Which one is more likely? Well, in the second reaction, C reacts with 2 D → E. If E is O3, then C + 2 D → O3.

But I'm not sure what C and D would be in that case.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a different molecule, like SO2, which has C2v symmetry.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on identifying C and D. Maybe I should focus on the symmetry groups and the options.

The options are:

A) C2

B) D4h

C) D∞h

D) C2v

If E is a linear molecule, it's likely D∞h. If it's a bent molecule, like ozone, it's C2v.

Given that E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a gas like phosgene (linear, D∞h) or ozone (bent, C2v).

But without knowing E's structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps E is a molecule like H2O2, which is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry. But H2O2 is not extremely hazardous. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe E is a molecule like Cl2O, which is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry. Cl2O is a chlorinated oxide and may be toxic.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like SO3, which is trigonal planar with D3h symmetry, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps E is a molecule like NO2, which has a bent structure with C2v symmetry. NO2 is a toxic gas, so that fits.

So if E is NO2, then its symmetry group is C2v, which is option D.

Now, putting that together:

E is NO2, which has C2v symmetry.

So the answer is D) C2v.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the breakdown:

1. **First Reaction**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. This suggests a stoichiometric ratio of 1:8 between A and B. Possible candidates for A and B were considered, but the exact identity of C remains unclear due to the lack of a definitive match for the bright red color.

2. **Second Reaction**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. E is likely a toxic gas, and its identity must align with the symmetry group options provided.

3. **Third Reaction**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). This indicates that C is likely a salt that hydrolyzes to yield these acids.

4. **Fourth Reaction**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Possible solvents like H2O or ethanol were considered, but the exact identity of D and B remains uncertain.

### Analysis of Symmetry Groups:
- **C2**: A twofold rotation axis. This symmetry group is unlikely for a highly toxic gas like E.
- **D4h**: A dihedral group with four-fold rotational symmetry and a horizontal mirror plane. This symmetry group is typically associated with square planar or octahedral molecules, which are not consistent with the likely identity of E.
- **D∞h**: A linear molecule with infinite symmetry. This group applies to molecules like CO2 or HCN. While CO2 is not extremely hazardous, phosgene (COCl2) is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry and is highly toxic. However, the reactions described do not clearly support phosgene as E.
- **C2v**: A bent molecule with a twofold rotation axis and two mirror planes at 45°. This group applies to molecules like O3 (ozone) or NO2. Both are toxic gases, with NO2 being a strong candidate for E due to its bent structure and C2v symmetry.

### Conclusion:
Based on the reactions and the symmetry group options, E is most likely a bent molecule with C2v symmetry. This aligns with the description of E as an extremely hazardous gas, making **NO2** a plausible candidate for E. Therefore, the molecular symmetry group of E is **C2v**.

Answer: D
