Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's asking.

The question is about a series of reactions, and based on that, we need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, I remember that symmetry groups are part of molecular spectroscopy, so this must relate to the structure of the molecule E.

Let me jot down all the given information:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

I need to figure out what each of these substances could be. Let's start with reaction 1. A reacting with B to form C. The stoichiometry is 1 A : 8 B, so maybe A is something that combines with multiple B molecules. The product C is bright red—that makes me think of something like copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate, which is bright blue, but maybe I'm wrong. Or perhaps it's something else. Alternatively, maybe C is a complex ion.

Wait, another thought: if C is a bright red product, maybe it's a transition metal complex. For example, maybe it's a permanganate or something else. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitro compound, but I'm not sure.

Looking at reaction 3: C reacts with water to reform A plus two acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak. When a salt reacts with water to form two acids, that suggests it's a salt of a diatomic anion. For example, maybe C is a sulfite or a nitrite or something like that. Wait, but then, when it reacts with water, it would hydrolyze into a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait, common examples: Let's think about sodium sulfite. Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, does it hydrolyze? Or maybe sodium sulfite reacting with water would produce H2SO3 (which is a weak acid) and NaOH (a strong base, but wait, that's not an acid). Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Alternatively, if C is a chloride of a metal that can form two different acids upon hydrolysis. Wait, perhaps it's a nitride? Like Mg3N2. Mg3N2 reacts with water to form Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait another thought: maybe C is a sulfide salt. For example, if C is FeS, but then reacting with water might not produce two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonate, but that would produce CO3^2- which upon hydrolysis would give H2CO3 (weak acid) and maybe another acid. Wait, but let's think about a different angle.

Alternatively, if C is a nitrate, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfate. Wait, another approach: the reaction of C with water gives two acids, F and G. F is strong, G is weak. So F might be HCl (strong) and G might be H2SO3 (weak), or something similar.

Wait, another thought: if C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is NaHSO4, which in water would dissociate into H+ and SO4^2- but that's not two acids. Wait, no. Alternatively, if C is a diacid salt, like Na2SO4. When it reacts with water, not much happens. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite salt, like Na2SO3. When it's hydrolyzed, it would produce H2SO3 (which is a weak acid) and NaOH (which is a strong base, but not an acid). Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe C is a bisulfate, like HSO4^-? No, that might not be the case.

Wait, maybe C is a nitrate salt, but that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal chloride that hydrolyzes to produce a strong acid and a weak acid. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the reaction where a salt of a weak acid might hydrolyze. For example, suppose C is sodium sulfide, Na2S. When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze:

Na2S + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2S↑

Here, NaOH is a strong base, but H2S is a weak acid. Wait, but the problem states that the products are two acids. So perhaps this isn't the case.

Another angle: maybe C is a metal carbonate, like Na2CO3. Reacting with water, it would hydrolyze into 2 NaOH and CO2. But CO2 is a weak acid (because it forms H2CO3, which is weak), and NaOH is a strong base. Again, not two acids.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about reaction 4: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, methanol, etc. So what reacts to form a solvent? Maybe D is H2O, but that's a gas? No, H2O is a liquid. Alternatively, perhaps H is something like NH3, which is a gas but can be a solvent in some contexts. Or maybe H is something like CH3OH (methanol), but how would that form?

Wait, D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio. So if D is H2O and B is NH3, then their reaction would form NH4OH (which is NH4+ and OH-), but that's not a solvent in itself. Alternatively, maybe D is Cl2 and B is NaOH? But that would form NaCl, which isn't a solvent either. Perhaps I need to think of something else.

Wait, another thought: D could be CO2 and B could be NaOH, but that would form sodium carbonate. Hmm, not a solvent.

Alternatively, perhaps D is SO2 and B is NaOH, forming NaHSO3 or something. But again, not a solvent.

Wait, maybe D is H2S and B is CuO, but that would form CuS, which is a solid. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a solvent like ethanol (C2H5OH). So D and B's reaction would form ethanol. But what would react to make ethanol? Maybe D is H2O and B is ethyl chloride, but that's not a gas. Alternatively, maybe D is H2O and B is something else. Hmm, not sure.

Let me try to approach this another way. Let's look at the first reaction: A + 8 B → C (bright red). So A is a solid, B is a gas. The product C is a bright red solid. Maybe C is a transition metal oxide or a nitrate.

Wait, maybe B is a diatomic gas, like O2 or Cl2? Let's say B is Cl2. Then A reacts with 8 equivalents of Cl2 to form C. What solid reacts with Cl2 in such a way? Maybe copper reacts with Cl2 upon heating to form CuCl2, but that's a 1:1 ratio. So that doesn't fit 8 equivalents. Hmm.

Another thought: if A is sodium (Na), and B is Cl2, then Na would react with Cl2 to form NaCl. But that's 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. So that's 1:1 molar ratio. Doesn't fit 8 equivalents.

Wait, perhaps B is another gas, like O2. So reaction of A with O2 in a 1:8 ratio. Let me think of a metal that forms an oxide with a high oxygen ratio. For example, iron forms FeO (1:1), Fe3O4 (1: (4/3)), but not 1:8. Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur, but sulfur reacts with O2 to form SO2 or SO3. The stoichiometry for SO3 is S + 3 O2 → SO3. So that's a 1:3 ratio, not 8.

Hmm... Maybe A is a transition metal that forms a complex with B. If B is NH3 gas, but I don't think that would fit. Alternatively, perhaps B is a halogen, and A is a metal that forms a polyhalide.

Wait, another approach: think about reaction 2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. What could E be? Maybe something like sarin gas, or another nerve agent, but I don't know. Alternatively, E might be a highly toxic gas like HCl or something else. Alternatively, perhaps E is a cyanide compound, but that's a thought.

Wait, but given that D is a gas (since reaction 2 is C + D → E), so D is a gas. Reaction 4: D and B react 1:1 to form H, a solvent. So H is a solvent, perhaps H2O, but D is a gas.

Wait, if D is H2O, but H2O is a liquid. So perhaps D is something else. Wait, maybe D is H2S gas. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps D is a diatomic gas like O2 or something else.

Wait, let's think about C's hydrolysis. When C reacts with water, it produces A and two acids, F and G. So C is a salt that, when dissolved in water, produces a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G). What kind of salt would do that?

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide salt. For example, suppose C is Na2S. When Na2S reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into 2 NaOH and H2S. But that gives a strong base (NaOH) and a weak acid (H2S). But the question states F and G are both acids. So perhaps this isn't right.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate salt. Let's say C is Na2CO3. When it reacts with water, it only partially hydrolyzes to form NaHCO3 and NaOH. But again, not two acids.

Wait, maybe C is a bisulfate, like HSO4^- Na+? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another thought: if C is a sulfamate, like something that would produce H2SO4 and another acid upon hydrolysis. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride, like Mg3N2. When Mg3N2 reacts with water, it produces Mg(OH)2 and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, so not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a peroxide, like Na2O2. Reacting with water would produce NaOH and O2. O2 is a diatomic gas, but NaOH is a strong base. Still, not two acids.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try to think about E. E is produced when C reacts with D (a gas). Let me think about what E could be. For E to be extremely hazardous, it could be something like chlorine gas, phosgene, a nerve agent, or a highly toxic compound like HCN.

Wait, but E is a product of C and D. So perhaps C is a chlorinated compound, and D is another gas, maybe H2O or something else. Alternatively, perhaps E is a chlorinated hydrocarbon.

Alternatively, perhaps D is a gas like H2S, and C is a metal salt that would react to form something dangerous. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: perhaps C is a metal sulfide. Let's say C is CuS. Then, reacting with H2O (if D is H2O) would give Cu(OH)2 and H2S. But H2S is a weak acid, and Cu(OH)2 is a base. But F and G are acids, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonate, but that again gives a base and CO2, which isn't an acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal nitrate. Let's say C is Cu(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, it would form Cu(OH)2 and nitric acid. Wait, no. Cu(NO3)2 is a nitrate salt, and when it hydrolyzes, it can produce HNO3 (a strong acid) and some other species. But I'm not sure if it produces two acids.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfate, like Na2SO4, which in water would just dissociate into ions, not producing acids. Hmm.

Wait, let me think differently. The reaction of C with water produces F and G, which are acids. So C must be a salt of a diacid anion. For example, suppose C is NaHSO4. Then when it reacts with water, it would dissociate into Na+ and HSO4^-; but HSO4^- can act as an acid or a base. Maybe it would produce H+ and SO4^2-? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a bisulfate, which upon hydrolysis would produce H2SO4 (strong acid) and another acid. Wait, that might fit. For example, if C is NaHSO3, the bisulfite ion. NaHSO3 in water can hydrolyze to produce H+ and SO3^2-.

Wait, but NaHSO3 would dissociate into Na+ and HSO3^- in solution. HSO3^- can act as an acid (donating a proton to form H2SO3 and SO3^2-). So perhaps when C is NaHSO3, it hydrolyzes into H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH. But that's a base again, not an acid.

Hmm, I'm stuck on this part. Let me try to think about reaction 4 again. D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H (a solvent). So what gases (B and D) react 1:1 to form a solvent?

Possible solvents are things like ethanol, methanol, water, etc. So H could be water, but then D would have to be something that reacts with B to form water. But water is already a product, so that's a possibility.

Wait, another approach: if H is NH3 (a solvent), then D and B would have to react to form NH3. So maybe B is N2 and D is H2. They react in a 1:3 ratio (N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3), but the problem says 1:1. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe B is NO and D is something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, H could be something like CH3OH (methanol). So D and B would react to form methanol. Maybe via CO2 + H2 → CH3OH, but that's more like Fischer-Tropsch, which I don't think is relevant here. Alternatively, maybe D is H2O and B is something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps D is CO2 and B is NaOH. Then, CO2 + NaOH → Na2CO3. But Na2CO3 isn't a solvent. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, if D is H2O and B is NH3, then their reaction would produce NH4OH (which is NH4+ and OH-), but that's not a solvent in itself. Or perhaps H is a solution of NH4OH in water, but that's more of a solution than a pure solvent.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of H as something else, like ethanol. So D and B would react to form ethanol. But I'm not sure what gases would react to form ethanol. Maybe D is H2O and B is something else. Not quite.

Alternatively, perhaps H is something like dimethyl ether, but I don't know what would react to form that.

Wait, perhaps H is something simpler, like carbon disulfide (CS2), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe H is a solution of NaOH, but that's more of a base.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible structures of E. Since E is extremely hazardous, it's probably a highly toxic gas. So possible candidates are HCN, CO, NO, SO2, Cl2, H2S, etc.

But E is the product of C and D. So, C is reacting with D (a gas) to form E. Let me think about what C could be. If C is a metal sulfide, reacting with H2O (if D is H2O) would give H2S (which is a weak acid, but not an extremely hazardous gas in that form—though it's toxic). Alternatively, if C is a nitride, like Mg3N2, reacting with H2O would give NH3 and Mg(OH)2. NH3 is a solvent, so that connects to reaction 4.

Wait, let's try this: If C is Mg3N2, then reaction 3 would be Mg3N2 (C) + H2O → Mg(OH)2 (A) + NH3 (F and G? Wait, but F and G are two acids. Mg(OH)2 is a base, and NH3 is a weak base. Doesn't fit.

Hmm. Let me think again. Maybe C is a carbonate. If C is Na2CO3, then when it reacts with water, it might not produce acids. But perhaps in reaction 3, C (Na2CO3) reacts with water to form 2 NaOH and CO2. CO2 is a weak acid (as it forms H2CO3), but NaOH is a strong base. So that's not two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. Then, when it reacts with water, it would produce NaOH and H2SO3. H2SO3 is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. Again, not two acids.

Wait, another angle: Maybe C is a metal sulfate that, when reacted with water, gives a strong acid and a weak acid. But I'm not sure which metal sulfate would do that.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate, like HNO3, but that's a strong acid itself, not a salt.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about reaction 4 again. D and B react 1:1 to form H, which is a solvent. Suppose H is NH3. So D and B would need to react to form NH3. What gases (B and D) could react 1:1 to form NH3? Maybe B is N2 and D is H2, but their reaction has a 3:1 ratio. Alternatively, maybe B is NO and D is H2, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps H is H2O, but that's a liquid. Or maybe H is ethanol—no, that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps B is a gas like O2 and D is something like H2. They could form H2O, but that's a liquid. Alternatively, B could be CO2 and D could be something else.

Alternatively, perhaps D is a gas like Cl2, and B is something that reacts with Cl2 in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent. For example, maybe B is NaOH, which would react with Cl2 to form NaCl and NaClO, but that's a solid.

Wait, maybe D is O2 and B is something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a solution of HCl, but that's not a pure solvent.

Hmm, maybe I should think about E's molecular structure because the question asks about its molecular symmetry group. So E's structure will determine its symmetry.

The options given are symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

I remember that:

- C2 is a two-fold rotation axis.
- D4h is the dihedral group with a four-fold rotation and horizontal mirror planes.
- D∞h is the dihedral group with an infinite-fold rotation axis, like in a regular polygon with infinite sides (e.g., a line of symmetry), but more commonly found in molecules like O2 (which has D∞h symmetry).
- C2v has a two-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes.

Wait, O2 has D∞h symmetry. Cl2 has D∞h as well because it's a diatomic molecule with a center of inversion and mirror planes.

Wait, then E's symmetry group would depend on its structure. So if E is a diatomic molecule like O2, Cl2, or H2O (but H2O is a triatomic molecule with C2v symmetry), but O2 and Cl2 are diatomic with D∞h.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule like CO2, which is linear, so it has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. H2O is not linear, so it has C2v symmetry.

Wait, wait another thought: Dihedral groups (Dnh) have n-fold rotation and mirror planes perpendicular to the axis. For diatomic molecules like O2, Cl2, H2O, CO2, etc., the symmetry varies. O2 and Cl2 are diatomic and have D∞h symmetry because they're linear with infinite symmetry around the axis (since they're homonuclear). If E is a homonuclear diatomic gas, its symmetry group would be D∞h.

So, if E is O2 or Cl2, the symmetry group is D∞h. But wait, the question says E is extremely hazardous. O2 is not extremely hazardous, but Cl2 is. So maybe E is Cl2?

Wait, but Cl2 is a diatomic molecule and has D∞h symmetry.

But let me think again. How would Cl2 form? Let's see. If in reaction 2, C reacts with D to form E (Cl2), then what would C and D be?

Cl2 is a diatomic molecule, so perhaps D is H2O and C is ClO− or something. Not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the reactions again. Earlier, I was stuck on reaction 3. Let me try to find a salt that when it reacts with water gives two acids.

Wait, another idea: perhaps C is a sulfonate salt. For example, if C is NaHSO4, when it reacts with water, it can dissociate into H+ and SO4^2- but that's more about acid strength. Alternatively, perhaps C is a diacid salt like NaHCO3. But that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal bisulfate, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe C is a metal nitrate like Al(NO3)3. When it reacts with water, it would just dissociate into Al^3+ and NO3^- ions. Doesn't produce acids.

Hmm. Maybe I'm stuck and need to try a different approach.

Let me think about the possible products and their properties.

If E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a nerve agent or a highly toxic gas. But without more info, it's hard to pinpoint.

Wait, another thought: in reaction 4, D and B form H, a solvent. Maybe H is something like NH3, which is a solvent. So D and B would need to be gases that react to form NH3. So possible B and D could be N2 and H2, but their reaction (Haber process) uses a 3:1 ratio, so that doesn't fit the 1:1 ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps D is NO and B is something else—unlikely.

Alternatively, H could be something like ethanol (CH3CH2OH), but that's not formed from gas reactions perhaps.

Wait, another approach: perhaps B is a diatomic gas like O2, and D is another diatomic gas like H2. Then, in reaction 4, O2 and H2 react in a 1:1 ratio to form H2O, which is a solvent. But the reaction is 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O, which is 1:1 ratio in terms of moles (since 2 moles H2 and 1 mole O2). So that's a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is another diatomic gas, but I don't see another that would fit a 1:1 reaction to form a solvent.

Wait, unless H is something like SO2? No, that's not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe H is a solution, but I think the question implies it's a pure solvent.

Wait, maybe H is NaOH solution, but that's a strong base, not a solvent per se. Or perhaps it's a solution of ammonia in water.

Wait, perhaps D is NH3 and B is H2O. Then, their reaction would be NH3 + H2O → NH4OH (which is a weak acid), but that's not a pure solvent. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps H is CH3OH (methanol), and D and B's reaction forms it. But I don't know which gases would react to form methanol. Maybe CO2 and H2? But that requires specific conditions.

I think I'm not making progress on this, so perhaps I should focus on E's structure for the symmetry group.

If E is a diatomic molecule, its symmetry group is likely D∞h. If E is a linear triatomic molecule, like CO2, then its symmetry is D∞h as well. Wait, no, CO2 is a linear molecule and has D∞h symmetry. But wait, CO2 is O=C=O, so linear. So yes, D∞h symmetry.

Wait, what about H2O? It's a bent molecule, so its symmetry is C2v. Because it has a two-fold rotation axis and two mirror planes. So symmetry group C2v.

So if E is H2O, then its symmetry group is C2v. But would E be H2O? Let me see.

Wait, E is formed by reaction of C and D. If D is O2, then perhaps C is something that reacts with O2 to form H2O, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2, which has D∞h symmetry. So the answer would be D) D∞h.

But wait, another possibility: if E is O2 (symmetry D∞h) or something else. But O2 is not extremely hazardous. Chlorine (Cl2) is, and it has D∞h symmetry.

But let me think about the reactions again. If E is Cl2, that would mean that C and D's reaction produces Cl2. So D would be something that when reacted with C gives Cl2.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chloride and D is something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide, and D is O2, but I don't see the connection.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's think of all the possible E candidates.

If E is a very hazardous gas, possible candidates are:

- HCN (highly toxic, but a liquid at room temp, but can be a gas when volatile)
- Cl2 (yellow-green gas, highly toxic)
- H2S (toxic gas, but not extremely so)
- SO2 (toxic gas)
- NO (toxic gas)
- CO (toxic gas, but not extremely)
- Phosgene (toxic gas, but has a specific smell and is used in dyes)
- Mustard gas (not a gas, actually a liquid)
- sarin gas (but it's an organophosphorus compound, not a simple gas)
- etc.

Among these, Cl2 is a diatomic gas with D∞h symmetry.

So, if E is Cl2, then its symmetry group is D∞h, which is option C.

Wait, but let's think again about the reactions leading to Cl2.

If E is Cl2, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → Cl2.

So, what could C and D be?

Cl2 is produced when HClO (hypochlorous acid) is treated with a strong base, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps C is NaClO (sodium hypochlorite) and D is HCl. Then, NaClO + 2 HCl → NaCl + H2O + Cl2↑.

That would make sense. So, in that case, C is NaClO, D is HCl, which is a gas.

Then, let's see if the earlier reactions fit.

Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (NaClO).

So, A would be NaOH, and B would be Cl2. Because NaOH reacts with Cl2 in a 2:1 ratio to form NaCl and NaClO, but wait, the stoichiometry would need to be 8 equivalents of B (Cl2) reacting with A (NaOH) to form C (NaClO).

Wait, the reaction between NaOH and Cl2 is: 

Cl2 + 2 NaOH → NaCl + NaClO + H2O 

That uses 1 mole Cl2 per 2 moles NaOH, producing 1 mole each of NaCl and NaClO. So, in that reaction, 1 mole of Cl2 reacts with 2 moles of NaOH to produce 1 mole of NaClO.

But in reaction 1, the stoichiometry is 1 A : 8 B → C.

So, maybe A is NaOH, and B is Cl2. Then, 1 mole of A would react with 8 moles of B to produce C. But according to the reaction, 2 moles of NaOH react with 1 mole of Cl2. So to produce 1 mole of C (NaClO), you need 2 moles of NaOH and 1 mole Cl2.

But in reaction 1, 1 mole A (NaOH) reacts with 8 moles B (Cl2) to produce C. That doesn't fit the stoichiometry.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting closer but not quite there.

Wait, perhaps C is a polyatomic ion that incorporates multiple Cl atoms. Let's say C is ClO^- or something. But I'm not sure.

Another thought: if C is ClO2 (chlorine dioxide), which is a bright red gas. Oh! Wait, the product C is bright red. ClO2 is a bright red gas, so that fits.

If C is ClO2, then reaction 1 would be A + 8 B → ClO2.

What could A and B be?

ClO2 is formed from the reaction of NaClO3 with HCl. The reaction is:

2 NaClO3 + 4 HCl → 2 ClO2 + 2 NaCl + 2 H2O.

In this reaction, 2 moles of NaClO3 react with 4 moles of HCl to produce 2 moles of ClO2. So the molar ratio is NaClO3 : HCl = 1:2.

But in reaction 1, the ratio is 1 A : 8 B → C. So perhaps A is NaClO3 and B is HCl. Then, 1 mole of NaClO3 would react with 4 moles of HCl to produce 1 mole of ClO2. But in the problem, it's 8 B per A. So that doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not on the right track. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a permanganate, like KMnO4, but that's a solid, not a bright red gas.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitro compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with water, it produces A and two acids F and G. Suppose A is NaOH. Then, when C reacts with water, it produces NaOH, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, perhaps C is a salt of a strong base and a weak acid.

Wait, but if C is NaClO, when it reacts with water, it produces NaOH and HClO. HClO is a weak acid (chlorous acid), and NaOH is a strong base. But the question states that F and G are acids, not a base and an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a salt of a weak base and a weak acid. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate, like Al2(SO4)3. Reacting with water wouldn't produce acids necessarily.

Wait, let me think about F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Common strong acids are HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak acids are like H2CO3, H3PO4, HCN, etc.

So, if C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces both a strong and a weak acid. For example, perhaps C is a sulfamate, like NH4HSO3. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitro compound. For example, if C is NaNO2, then when it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to form HNO2 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). But again, that gives a base and an acid, not two acids.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a bisulfate, like HSO3^- Na+. When it reacts with water, the HSO3^- can act as an acid or a base. If it donates a proton, it becomes SO3^2- and H+. H+ would be a strong acid (H+ is just protons), but that's not a real acid. Alternatively, maybe HSO3^- can accept a proton to form H2SO3 (a weak acid) and release SO3^2- which could form another acid?

Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, like NaHCO3. When NaHCO3 reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into NaOH (strong base) and H2CO3 (weak acid). But again, not two acids.

Wait, maybe C is a metal bicarbonate, like NaHCO3, which upon hydrolysis forms NaOH and H2CO3. But that's a base and an acid, not two acids.

Hmm, I'm really stuck on this. Let me think of other possibilities.

Wait, another approach: F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So perhaps F is H2SO4 (strong), and G is H2SO3 (weak). So C could be a sulfite sulfate salt. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed salt, like NH4HSO3. Upon hydrolysis, it could produce H2SO3 and NH4OH. But NH4OH is a weak base, not a acid.

Hmm. Maybe this is a dead end. Let me think about reaction 2 again.

C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. If E is Cl2, then D could be HCl and C could be NaClO. Because NaClO + 2 HCl → NaCl + H2O + Cl2↑. That reaction is plausible.

So, if C is NaClO, then reaction 3 (C + H2O → A + F + G) would be NaClO + H2O → NaOH + HClO. So F is HClO (weak acid) and G is... wait, no, A is NaOH, which is a base, not an acid. But the problem states that the products are A (solid), and two acids F and G. So this doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about E being Cl2. Let me think about another possibility.

If E is O3 (ozone), which is a toxic gas, but I'm not sure about its symmetry. Ozone is a triatomic molecule with a bent structure, so its symmetry group is C2v. So if E is O3, then the symmetry group would be C2v.

But how would E form from C and D?

Alternatively, if E is SO2, which has D∞h symmetry because it's a linear molecule (O-S-O). Wait, SO2 is a bent molecule, though, so its symmetry group is C2v. Because it has a two-fold axis and a mirror plane.

Alternatively, SO2 has D∞h symmetry? Wait, no, SO2 is a bent molecule, so it's not linear. Therefore, its symmetry group is C2v.

Wait, but I'm getting confused between O3 and SO2. O3 is a bent molecule (O-O-O) with a central oxygen, so it has a C2v symmetry. Similarly, SO2 is a bent molecule (S in the center), so it also has C2v.

Wait, then if E is SO2, its symmetry group is C2v.

But how would E form?

If C is, say, Na2SO3, and D is H2O, then reaction would be Na2SO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + H2SO3. But H2SO3 is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so again, not two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is H2SO4, but that's a strong acid, not a solid.

Hmm.

I think I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should look at the options and make an educated guess.

The options are:

A) C2

B) D4h

C) D∞h

D) C2v

E is a product whose symmetry group is to be determined. If E is a diatomic molecule like O2 or Cl2, its symmetry group is D∞h. If E is a bent triatomic molecule like H2O or SO2, its symmetry group is C2v.

Given that E is extremely hazardous, Cl2 and O3 are possibilities. Cl2 is diatomic (D∞h), while O3 is bent (C2v).

But how does E form?

Wait, another thought: perhaps E is a product of C and D where D is O2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe E is NO2, which is a toxic gas. NO2 is a bent molecule, so its symmetry group is C2v.

So if E is NO2, its symmetry group is C2v.

But I'm not confident about this.

Wait, perhaps I should consider another approach. If E's symmetry is D∞h, then it's likely a diatomic molecule. If it's C2v, a bent molecule.

The product E is extremely hazardous, so Cl2 is a strong candidate. Cl2 has D∞h symmetry. So the answer would be option C) D∞h.

But earlier, I thought that reaction 2 would be C (NaClO) + D (HCl) → E (Cl2), but that doesn't fit reaction 3 because when NaClO reacts with water, it produces NaOH and HClO, which is a base and an acid. But the question says two acids are formed.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. If C is NaClO, and when it reacts with water, it produces NaOH (strong base) and HClO (weak acid). But the problem states that the reaction produces two acids. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps C is a different compound. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester. For example, if C is something like CH3SO3Na (sodium methyl sulfonate). When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes into H2SO4 (strong acid) and CH3OH (weak acid? Wait, methanol is not an acid. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a phosphonate ester, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonate. When it reacts with water, it doesn't produce acids. Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Perhaps I should proceed with the information I have. E is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry, so the answer is C) D∞h.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The bright red color suggests C could be a compound like ClO2 (chlorine dioxide), which is a bright red gas. This aligns with the possibility of C being a chlorinated compound.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. If E is a diatomic molecule like Cl2 (chlorine gas), it is highly toxic and fits the description. Cl2 is a homonuclear diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). If C is NaClO (sodium hypochlorite), it reacts with water to produce NaOH (strong base) and HClO (weak acid). However, this does not fit the problem's description of producing two acids. This suggests C may be a different compound, but the key focus remains on E's symmetry.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. This reaction is less critical to determining E's symmetry but supports the possibility of D and B being gases that form a solvent.

5. **Symmetry Analysis**: The options for molecular symmetry groups are:
   - **C2**: A two-fold rotation axis.
   - **D4h**: A dihedral group with a four-fold rotation and horizontal mirror planes.
   - **D∞h**: A dihedral group with an infinite-fold rotation axis, typical of homonuclear diatomic molecules like Cl2.
   - **C2v**: A two-fold rotation axis with two vertical mirror planes, typical of bent triatomic molecules like H2O or SO2.

Given that E is extremely hazardous and likely a diatomic molecule, Cl2 is a strong candidate. Cl2 is a homonuclear diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. This matches the description of E and aligns with the symmetry group D∞h.

Thus, the molecular symmetry group of E is **D∞h**.
