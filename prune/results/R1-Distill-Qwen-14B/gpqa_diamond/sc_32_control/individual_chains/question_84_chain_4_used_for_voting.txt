Okay, so I've got this question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. The question is about the key factor that converts a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, specifically when approximating the matrix exponential function using a fractional approximation.

Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to piece it together. I remember that when solving PDEs, especially heat equations, finite difference methods are common. Higher order methods improve accuracy but can lead to large systems of equations, which are often solved using matrix exponentials.

Wait, matrix exponentiation is used in methods like the exponential time differencing. But how does that tie into parallel algorithms? Oh right, for parallel computing, you want to split the computation into parts that can be done simultaneously.

So, the process involves discretizing the spatial derivatives, leading to a large system of ODEs in time. The solution involves terms like e^(At), where A is a matrix derived from the spatial discretization. If A is large and sparse, directly computing e^(At) is computationally intensive, especially for large systems.

In a sequential algorithm, you might compute this matrix exponential step by step. But in a parallel setup, you need a way to split the computation. I think this is where some kind of approximation comes into play. The question mentions a fractional approximation. Fractional here could refer to methods like those using Krylov subspaces or other approximation techniques for matrix functions.

Wait, Krylov methods are iterative and can be used to compute matrix functions efficiently. But how does that help with parallelism? Oh, maybe the idea is that you can split the exponentiation into parts that can be computed in parallel. Alternatively, maybe the approach involves decomposing the matrix A into smaller components that can be handled by different processors.

But the question is about the key factor. The options are A to D. Let's look at them one by one.

Option A: Stability analysis. That's important for ensuring the numerical method doesn't blow up, but it's more about the method's accuracy and whether the errors remain bounded. Not directly about parallelism.

Option B: Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions. Nonlocal conditions are tricky, but I'm not sure how that would directly influence the conversion to a parallel algorithm. It might affect the setup of the matrix, but not the parallelism key factor.

Option C: Complex roots of fractional approximation. Hmm, complex roots would affect the stability and behavior of the solution. But how do they tie into parallel splitting? Maybe if the approximation's roots allow for certain decompositions that can be parallelized. Not sure yet.

Option D: Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation. Oh, linear partial fractions are used in breaking down complex functions into simpler terms. If the fractional approximation can be split into a sum of simpler functions, each part could be computed in parallel. That makes sense because each term in the partial fraction could be handled by a different processor.

Wait, but I thought partial fractions are more about algebraic manipulation. For example, decomposing a rational function into simpler fractions. If the matrix exponential approximation can be expressed as a sum of exponentials of simpler matrices, each of which can be computed in parallel, that would enable parallel processing.

So, if the fractional approximation can be linearly partially fractioned, it allows each term to be computed independently, thus enabling parallel computation. So the key factor would be the ability to decompose the problem into such fractions.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the structure of the matrix in the approximation. If the matrix has certain properties, like being diagonalizable or having a particular decomposition, that could help in parallel computation.

Wait, stepping back. The matrix exponential is e^A. If you can express e^A as a sum of terms that can be computed separately, like e^{A1} + e^{A2} + ..., where A1, A2 are parts of A that can be handled in parallel, then that would make the algorithm parallel.

So, how do you split A? For example, in some methods, you might split A into a sum of matrices or operators that commute, so their exponentials can be multiplied or added.

But the question is about a fractional approximation. Fractional approximation methods for matrix functions might involve rational approximations, which can be decomposed into partial fractions. Each term in the partial fraction decomposition can then be computed in parallel because they are independent.

So the key factor here is the linear partial fraction of the fractional approximation. That would allow you to split the computation into parallel tasks.

Looking at the options again, option D is about the linear partial fraction. So that's the right choice.

Wait, but another thought: complex roots could lead to terms that can be expressed as e^{λt}, where λ has an imaginary part leading to sine and cosine terms. But I'm not sure how that directly leads to parallelism. Maybe if you have multiple eigenvalues that can be handled separately, but that might not directly tie into the approximation method.

So, I think option D is more about the decomposition that allows parallel computation. Therefore, the answer is D.

When solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting, the matrix exponential function is often approximated using a fractional approximation. Converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one requires a key factor that enables the problem to be split into independent subtasks that can be computed simultaneously.

Option A, stability analysis, ensures the numerical method remains accurate and bounded but does not directly address parallelism. Option B, nonlocal boundary conditions, may influence the setup of the matrix but is not central to parallelization. Option C, complex roots of fractional approximation, affects the behavior of the solution but does not directly enable parallel computation. 

Option D, linear partial fraction of fractional approximation, refers to decomposing the fractional approximation into simpler terms. This decomposition allows the matrix exponential to be expressed as a sum of independent terms, each of which can be computed in parallel. This is the key factor enabling the conversion of the sequential algorithm into a parallel one.
