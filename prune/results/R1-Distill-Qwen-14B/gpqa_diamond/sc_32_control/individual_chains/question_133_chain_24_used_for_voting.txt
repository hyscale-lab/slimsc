Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question again.

The problem states that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. We're asked to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2- or PO4^3- maybe?) in this solution. The temperature is 25°C, and we're given the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in phosphate buffer solutions, the different K values correspond to the deprotonation steps. So H3PO4 loses a proton to become H2PO4^-, then another to become HPO4^2-, and finally another to become PO4^3-.

Given that we have KH2PO4 (which is K+ and H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4·2H2O (which should dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-), so in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but how do these ions relate to each other? I think they can interconvert. So the solution is a buffer solution between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. Because these two are adjacent in the deprotonation series.

So, the concentration of orthophosphate ions would depend on the pH of the solution. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, but wait, that's the fully deprotonated form. Or wait, no—the question specifies orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to HPO4^2-? Because PO4^3- is the more deprotonated form. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, and the various deprotonated forms are called phosphates. So H2PO4^- is dihydrogen phosphate, HPO4^2- is hydrogen phosphate, and PO4^3- is orthophosphate. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting that wrong. I think sometimes people refer to HPO4^2- as the orthophosphate ion, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to PO4^3- as orthophosphate. I need to clarify that.

Alternatively, perhaps the term "orthophosphate" refers to the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-. But in this solution, the pH is probably such that the predominant forms are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because the solution is a buffer between these two. So maybe the concentration of orthophosphate (PO4^3-) is very low because the pH is higher than the pKa3 of H3PO4.

Wait, let's think about the pKa values. Ka1 is 7.5e-3, so pKa1 is around -log(7.5e-3). Let me calculate that: log(7.5)=0.875, so pKa1 is about 2.125. Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is about 7.21 (since log(6.2e-8)= approx 7.21). Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so pKa3 is about 11.74.

So the solution contains H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4). Since HPO4^2- can act as a base and accept a proton to form H2PO4^-, or as an acid to lose a proton and form PO4^3-. But given the pH of the solution, which is determined by the buffer system of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, we can find the concentration of HPO4^2- and then any contributions from PO4^3-.

Wait, but if the pH is somewhere around pKa2 (7.21), then the HPO4^2- concentration and H2PO4^- concentrations would be significant, but PO4^3- is negligible unless the pH is much higher than pKa3, which is around 11.74. Since the solution is at 25°C, which is neutral pH, around 7, which is near pKa2. So the solution's pH is around that value.

So the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is PO4^3-, then in this solution, which is buffered around pH 7, the concentration of PO4^3- would be extremely low because pH is much lower than pKa3 (11.74). Most of the phosphate would be HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to HPO4^2- as orthophosphate. I might have gotten that wrong. Let me think. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, so the deprotonated forms are H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate or orthophosphate?), and PO4^3- (orthophosphate). Hmm, maybe the terminology varies. But in any case, the problem is about the concentration of the phosphate ion in solution, which is probably the HPO4^2- because that's the species present in the solution from the given salts.

Wait, the question says "orthophosphate ions"—perhaps that refers to PO4^3-? But in that case, under pH 7, which is much lower than pKa3 (11.74), PO4^3- would be almost zero. So the concentration would be negligible. But the options given are all in the 1e-7 range, which suggests that it's not zero. So perhaps the question refers to HPO4^2- as orthophosphate. Alternatively, perhaps the solution I should be calculating is the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the problem says 'concentration of orthophosphate ions'—so maybe it's PO4^3-? Or maybe it's asking for the sum of all phosphate species, but that's not likely. Alternatively, perhaps orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the buffer solution and using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH, then using that pH to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but the solution is a mixture of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. So that's a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So let me start by calculating the moles of each salt.

For KH2PO4: Mw is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007337 moles.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: Mw is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005611 moles.

Wait, wait, the formula for Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. So the formula unit is Na2HPO4·2H2O, which would have a molar mass of (2*22.99) + (1*30.97) + (4*16.00) + (2*(2*1.008 + 16.00)) = let me compute that.

Wait, maybe I should just take the given Mw as 177.99. So moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005611 moles.

So the solution has 0.007337 moles of H2PO4^- and 0.005611 moles of HPO4^2-.

The volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 L.

So concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007337 mol / 0.2 L ≈ 0.036685 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005611 mol / 0.2 L ≈ 0.028055 M.

Now, since these are a buffer system (H2PO4^- / HPO4^2-), the pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa2 + log([A^-]/[HA]), where A^- is the conjugate base (HPO4^2-) and HA is the acid (H2PO4^-).

So pKa2 is about 7.21 (as calculated earlier).

So pH = 7.21 + log(0.028055 / 0.036685)

Compute the ratio: 0.028055 / 0.036685 ≈ 0.7655.

Log(0.7655) is approximately -0.115.

So pH ≈ 7.21 - 0.115 ≈ 7.095.

So the pH is around 7.1.

Now, to find the concentration of PO4^3- (orthophosphate), we can look at the third dissociation.

HPO4^2- can lose a proton to become PO4^3-:

HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+

The Ka for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8e-12, so pKa3 is about 11.74.

At pH 7.1, which is much lower than pKa3, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low.

Using the formula for weak acid (or base) concentration: [PO4^3-] = [HPO4^2-] * alpha, where alpha is (Ka3 / (Ka3 + Kw / [H+]))

Wait, alternatively, using the expression:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

We have Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.1) ≈ 7.94e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12) * (0.028055 M) / (7.94e-8 M)

Let me compute this:

Calculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028055 ≈ 5.05e-14.

Divide by denominator: 5.05e-14 / 7.94e-8 ≈ approx 5.05e-14 / 8e-8 ≈ 6.31e-7 M.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

[H+] is 10^-7.1. 10^-7 is 1e-7, 10^0.1 is about 1.2589, so 10^-7.1 is approximately 1.2589e-8? Wait no, wait. Wait, 10^-7 is 1e-7, and 10^-0.1 is about 0.794. So 10^-7.1 = 1e-7 * 1e-0.1 = 1e-7 * 0.794 ≈ 7.94e-8 M. So yeah, that's correct.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12) * (0.028055) / (7.94e-8)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028055 = 1.8 * 0.028055 = approx 0.0505e-12 → 5.05e-14.

Divide by 7.94e-8: 5.05e-14 / 7.94e-8 = (5.05 / 7.94) * 1e-6 → approx 0.6355 * 1e-6 → 6.355e-7 M.

Wait, but wait: 5.05 / 7.94 → 5.05 ÷ 7.94 ≈ 0.6355.

So [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.355e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. But wait, my calculation is approx 6.35e-7. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, let me recalculate the numerator and denominator.

First, [HPO4^2-] is 0.028055 M. Correct.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

[H+] is 7.94e-8. Correct.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12) * (0.028055) / (7.94e-8)

Compute numerator:

1.8e-12 * 0.028055 = ?

1.8 * 0.028055 = 0.0505 → 0.0505e-12 = 5.05e-14.

Now, 5.05e-14 divided by 7.94e-8 is:

(5.05 /7.94) * 1e-6 → approximately 0.6355 * 1e-6 = 6.355e-7 M.

But the options don't have exactly that. The closest is option A, 6.24e-7.

Wait, perhaps I need to be more precise with the calculations.

Let me recompute the [H+] more accurately.

pH is 7.095.

[H+] = 10^(-7.095) = ?

Let me compute that. Let's do it step by step.

log(7.095) is in the exponent, but wait no, 10^(-7.095) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.095).

10^(-7) is 1e-7.

10^(-0.095) ≈ 10^(-0.1) is 0.7943; but since it's -0.095, it's a bit higher. Let me compute 10^0.095.

Wait, 10^0.095 is e^(0.095 * ln10) ≈ e^(0.095 * 2.3026) ≈ e^(0.2187) ≈ 1.244.

So 10^(-0.095) = 1/1.244 ≈ 0.8043.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.8043 ≈ 8.043e-8 M.

Wait, that's slightly different from my earlier estimate of 7.94e-8. So using 8.043e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028055) / 8.043e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028055 = 5.05e-14.

Denominator: 8.043e-8.

So 5.05e-14 / 8.043e-8 = (5.05 /8.043) * 1e-6 → 5.05 ÷8.043 ≈ 0.6278 → 0.6278e-6 → 6.278e-7.

Ah, that's about 6.28e-7 M, which is very close to option A's 6.24e-7. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but the options given are:

A) 6.24x10^-7 M

B)5.48x10^-7 M

C)2.81x10^-7 M

D)3.97x10^-7 M

So the calculation I did gives approx 6.278e-7, which rounds to 6.28e-7. The option A is 6.24e-7, which is close enough considering possible rounding in the steps.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me check the moles again.

KH2PO4: 1g / 136.09 g/mol → 1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007337 mol.

Yes.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1g / 177.99 g/mol → 1/177.99 ≈ 0.005611 mol.

Yes.

Concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007337 / 0.2 = 0.036685 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005611 / 0.2 = 0.028055 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) → let me compute that accurately.

Ka2 =6.2e-8 → log(6.2e-8)= log(6.2)+log(1e-8) → 0.7924 -8 → -7.2076 → pKa2 = 7.2076.

So pH = 7.2076 + log(0.028055 / 0.036685).

Compute the ratio: 0.028055 / 0.036685 ≈ 0.7655.

Log(0.7655) → let's calculate it accurately.

Log(0.7) is about -0.1549, log(0.7655) is higher.

Using a calculator in my mind: 10^(-0.115) = 0.77, so log(0.7655) is approximately -0.115.

So pH ≈ 7.2076 - 0.115 ≈ 7.0926.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.0926) → let's compute more accurately.

10^-7.0926 = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0926).

10^(-0.0926) = 1 / 10^(0.0926). Let's compute 10^0.0926.

0.0926 is close to 0.09, where 10^0.09 ≈ 1.23 (since 10^0.07918 is 1.2, 0.09 is about 1.23).

Wait, perhaps a more precise way: 0.0926 is 0.09, so 10^0.09 ≈ 1.23. Let me check.

Using the formula: ln(10^x) = x ln10. Wait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, using the Taylor series? Or perhaps using a calculator approach. Alternatively, I can compute ln(1.23) to find if it's about 0.09.

Wait, I know that ln(1.22) is about 0.198, wait no, wait: Wait, no, ln(1.23) is approximately 0.2075. Hmm, but that's for natural logs. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that 10^0.09 ≈ 1.23? Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 10^0.0926:

Let me think: 10^0.09 = approx 1.23. 10^0.0926 is a bit higher, maybe 1.235.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 1/1.235 ≈ 8.1e-8 M.

Wait, earlier calculations had [H+] as 7.94e-8, but more accurately, perhaps 8.1e-8.

Wait, but maybe I should use more precise calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the exact value of [H+] for more accurate calculation.

But perhaps I can just proceed with the previous calculation leading to approx 6.24e-7, which is option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. As I thought earlier, perhaps orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-.

Wait, that can't be right because the question says the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So the concentration of HPO4^2- is about 0.028 M, which is way higher than the options given.

But the options are all around 1e-7, so that suggests that the orthophosphate is PO4^3-, which is the fully deprotonated form. So that's why the concentration is so low.

So the calculation I did earlier is correct, and the concentration of PO4^3- is 6.24e-7 M, which matches option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers HPO4^2- as orthophosphate, but that doesn't make sense with the options given.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem wants the concentration of HPO4^2- plus PO4^3-? No, because the options are way too small for that.

No, I think the problem is asking for PO4^3-.

So the calculation steps are correct, and the closest option is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the given data and apply the relevant chemical principles.

### Step 1: Moles of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O
The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol). The moles of each compound are calculated as:

\[
\text{Moles of KH₂PO₄} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007337 \, \text{mol}
\]
\[
\text{Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005611 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 2: Concentrations in Solution
The solution volume is 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L. The concentrations of the ions are:

\[
[\text{H₂PO₄}^-] = \frac{0.007337 \, \text{mol}}{0.200 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.036685 \, \text{M}
\]
\[
[\text{HPO₄}^{2-}] = \frac{0.005611 \, \text{mol}}{0.200 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.028055 \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 3: Buffer System and pH
The solution is a buffer system involving H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, with the equilibrium governed by the second dissociation constant \( K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄}^-]} \right)
\]

The p\( K_a2 \) is:

\[
\text{p}K_a2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.21
\]

Substituting the concentrations:

\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + \log \left( \frac{0.028055}{0.036685} \right)
\]

The ratio \( \frac{0.028055}{0.036685} \approx 0.7655 \), and \( \log(0.7655) \approx -0.115 \). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} \approx 7.21 - 0.115 = 7.095
\]

### Step 4: Concentration of PO₄³⁻
The third dissociation of HPO₄²⁻ is:

\[
\text{HPO₄}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{PO₄}^{3-} + \text{H}^+
\]

The equilibrium constant is \( K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \), and the relationship is:

\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{PO₄}^{3-}][\text{H}^+]}{[\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}
\]

Rearranging for \( [\text{PO₄}^{3-}] \):

\[
[\text{PO₄}^{3-}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}{[\text{H}^+]}
\]

The hydrogen ion concentration is:

\[
[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.095} \approx 8.04 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
[\text{PO₄}^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028055)}{8.04 \times 10^{-8}}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028055) \approx 5.05 \times 10^{-14}
\]

Then, divide by the denominator:

\[
[\text{PO₄}^{3-}] = \frac{5.05 \times 10^{-14}}{8.04 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.28 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Final Answer
The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately \( 6.28 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches the closest option:

**Answer: A**
