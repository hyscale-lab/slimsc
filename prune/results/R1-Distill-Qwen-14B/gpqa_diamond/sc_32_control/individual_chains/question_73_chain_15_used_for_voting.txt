Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but let me think.

First, I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them normally because that would give a speed greater than c, which is impossible. Instead, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Wait, wait, but the direction matters. Both are moving in the same direction, so I think the relative speed is the difference, but I have to apply the formula correctly.

So let's plug in the values. The first astronaut's speed is 0.6c, and the second is 0.5c. So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So, (0.6c - 0.5c) is 0.1c in the numerator. Then the denominator is 1 minus (0.6c * 0.5c)/c². Let's compute that: 0.6*0.5 is 0.3, and c squared divided by c squared is 1, so 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7. Let me calculate that: 0.1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.142857... So roughly 0.14c. Oh wait, wait, that's about 0.14c. So that matches options C and D, which have v_rel as 0.14c.

Now, moving on to the total energy of the system. Hmm, the total energy in relativity is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for each astronaut, I'll compute their gamma and then multiply by their respective masses and sum them up.

First astronaut: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2 ) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m * c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

Hmm, sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660, so 1/0.8660 is approximately 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² = 1.1547 * 3m c² → let's calculate that. 1.1547 *3 is approximately 3.4641.

So E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c². Rounded to three significant figures, that's about 5.96 m c².

Looking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option B has E=4.96, which is lower. So option C must be the correct one.

Wait, just to make sure, let me check my calculations again. The velocities are both in the same direction, so the relative speed calculation is (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c²) = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1 /0.7 = approx 0.1428c. So 0.14c is correct.

E1 is 2.5 m c², E2 is about 3.464 m c², sum is 5.964, so 5.96 mc². Yep, that's option C.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system. The relativistic energy of each astronaut is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), velocity \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), velocity \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

From the options, the relative speed \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\) and the total energy \(E_{\text{total}} = 5.96m c^2\) match option C.

**Answer: C**
