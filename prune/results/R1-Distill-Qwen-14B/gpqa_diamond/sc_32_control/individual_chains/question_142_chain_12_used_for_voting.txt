Okay, so I'm trying to figure out where this density matrix ρ is located in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. But wait, the question is about the geometrical position. I think this relates to how the density matrix is represented in the Bloch sphere or maybe some other space.

Let me look at the given ρ: it's (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Oh, wait a second, I've heard about this before. When the density matrix is an equal mixture of |0> and |1>, it must be a completely mixed state. Because if you have ρ = (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, that's like having no coherence between the states, right? So the state is a statistical mixture of the two basis states.

I remember that the Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. But wait, how does this density matrix translate into the Bloch vector? Oh right, the Bloch sphere representation uses a vector r where each component corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. So the density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

So let's see. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute each component. |0><0| is the outer product, which in matrix form is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (I)/2.

Wait, I think I know this. The identity matrix is the maximally mixed state. So in terms of the Bloch sphere, this state would have r = (0,0,0), because the identity matrix corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. Because when you write ρ as (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2, if r is all zeros, you get (I)/2.

So looking back at the options: option C is (0,0,0), which would be the origin. That makes sense because the state has no coherence and is equally likely to be in |0> or |1>, which is the maximally mixed state.

Wait, let me double-check. The density matrix ρ for a qubit can be written as ρ = (I + r_x X + r_y Y + r_z Z)/2, where X, Y, Z are Pauli matrices. The coefficients r_x, r_y, r_z form the Bloch vector. For the identity matrix I, which is 2ρ in this case, ρ is (I)/2. So all the coefficients r_x, etc., must be zero because there's nothing else in ρ besides I. So yes, r is (0,0,0), which is option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state, as it is an equal statistical mixture of the basis states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. For the given \(\rho\), it simplifies to 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2},
\]

which implies that all components of the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) are zero (\(r_x = 0\), \(r_y = 0\), \(r_z = 0\)). This corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere, representing the maximally mixed state.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position of \(\rho\) in qubit space is 

\[
\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0).
\]
