Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their photospheres, specifically about iron atoms in different energy levels. Hmm, I remember that in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, the distribution of particles in energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. 

The question states that the iron atoms in star 1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star 2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. We need to find the correct equation relating the effective temperatures T1 and T2.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy states. The formula I think is n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). Here, E is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the energy level in star 1 is twice as excited as in star 2. Let me denote the number of excited atoms in star 1 as n1 and in star 2 as n2. So n1 = 2 * n2. 

But wait, the ratio is n1/n2 = 2. But according to the Boltzmann equation, this ratio depends on the temperatures of each star. Since both stars have the same energy difference (E), but possibly different temperatures.

Wait, but wait, the energy difference is the same for both stars. So E is 1.38e-23 J for both. So, for star 1: n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ), assuming E_i is higher than E_j, but wait, or is it the other way around? Since if the higher energy level, then the exponent would be negative. Wait, no, the Boltzmann factor is exponential of (-ΔE/(kT)). So if E_i is higher than E_j, then n_i is less than n_j, unless temperature is high enough.

Wait, but in this problem, the excited state is higher energy than the ground state, I think. So if a star has more atoms in an excited state, that implies it's hotter. Because higher temperature makes the exponential factor larger, so the ratio n_i/n_j increases.

Wait, so given that n1 = 2 n2, but wait, wait. Wait, no, the problem states that the excited level in star 1 is twice as excited as in star 2. So that's n1 = 2 n2. Let me clarify: excited level means higher energy, so the population of that level is n1 for star 1 and n2 for star 2.

So the ratio is (n1)/(n2) = 2. Using the Boltzmann formula, 2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, no. Wait, let me think again. The ratio is n1/n2 = exp( - (ΔE)/(k T1) ) / exp( - (ΔE)/(k T2) ) ) * (g1/g2). But wait, wait, I might be confusing the terms. Let me correct.

The Boltzmann equation for two levels i and j is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if i is the excited state and j is the ground, then E_i - E_j is positive. So for star 1, the ratio n1_excited / n1_ground = (g1/g1_ground) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), assuming same g for both stars? Or is the degeneracy same for each level in both stars? The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume the same g for both stars, so g1 = g2, so g cancels out. 

Wait, but in the problem, it's about the same energy levels in both stars, so the same E. So for each star, their own ratio is determined by their own T.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of n in star 1 compared to star 2. So perhaps the ratio is (n1/n2) = [ (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] ?

Wait, no. Wait, each star has its own ratio. For star 1, n1_excited / n1_ground = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)). Similarly for star 2, n2_excited / n2_ground = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But the problem states that the number of excited atoms in star 1 is twice that in star 2. So perhaps n1_excited = 2 * n2_excited. But wait, that's not correct because each star's n is relative to their own ground state. So perhaps, considering both stars, the ratio of their excited states is (n1_excited / n2_excited) = 2.

But wait, that's not the case because each star's ground state is different. Maybe a better approach is to take the ratio of (n1_excited / n1_ground) divided by (n2_excited / n2_ground) equals 2/(n2_ground/n1_ground). Hmm, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio between the excited and ground states for each star is given by their own T. But the problem states that the excited level in star 1 is twice that in star 2. So perhaps it's (n1_excited / n1_ground) = 2 * (n2_excited / n2_ground). 

Because n1_excited is twice n2_excited, but that would be under the same ground state population. Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should model this with variables.

Let me define for star 1: (n1_i)/(n1_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
Similarly, for star 2: (n2_i)/(n2_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The problem states that (n1_i) = 2 * (n2_i). But wait, no, it's that the excited level is twice as excited. So maybe the ratio (n1_i)/(n2_i) = 2.

But considering each star's ground state, we can't directly compare n1_i and n2_i because the total population (n_i + n_j) varies. Hmm, perhaps I need to relate the ratios for each star.

Wait, perhaps the total number of atoms in the excited state for star 1 is twice that for star 2. But without knowing the total number of atoms, it's tough. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the populations is (n1_i)/(n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i)/(n2_j), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the excited state population to the ground state in star 1 is twice that in star 2. So:

(n1_i / n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j)
But from the Boltzmann equation, each of these is equal to (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where T is the star's temperature.

Assuming that the ground state and excited state have the same g in both stars (g_i and g_j are the same for both stars), then we can write:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, but wait. Let me think.

If (n1_i)/(n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i)/(n2_j), then:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking the ratio:

exp( (ΔE/(k T2)) - (ΔE/(k T1)) ) = 2

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

(ΔE/(k)) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Hmm, but wait, let me re-express the equation.

Let me write the equation again:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k T2)):

exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2

Which is:

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

Take ln:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Let me re-arrange the equation:

ΔE/(k) [ (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Alternatively, factor out a -1:

ΔE/(k) [ (1/(T1) - 1/(T2) ) ] = - ln(2)

But that might not directly help. Let me think about rearranging to find T1 and T2.

Let me denote (1/T1) as x and (1/T2) as y.

So the equation becomes:

ΔE/(k) (y - x) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the sign. Let's recheck.

From earlier, the equation after taking the ratio and logs gave:

(ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but let me go back step by step.

We have:

exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] ) = 2 * exp( [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Divide both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ):

exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = 2

Factor out ΔE/(k):

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = 2

Take ln of both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = ln(2)

So,

(1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = ( ln(2) * k ) / ΔE

Wait, but let's compute that. Given that ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. Hmm, but perhaps we can relate the temperatures.

Wait, but let's think about the options. All options involve ln(2) equals some function of T1 and T2.

Looking at the options:

Option A: ln(2) = T2 / T1 → ln(2) = (T2)/(T1)

Option B: ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2 )

Option C: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )^2

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Hmm, our derived equation is:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ( ln(2) * k ) / ΔE

But let's solve for T1 and T2.

So,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (k ln(2) ) / ΔE

But wait, the right side is a constant. Let's compute that.

Wait, given that ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. Let me calculate the right-hand side.

k is Boltzmann's constant, approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

So,

( ln(2) * k ) / ΔE = ( ln(2) * 1.38e-23 ) / ( 1.38e-23 ) = ln(2) * (1.38e-23 / 1.38e-23 ) ) = ln(2).

So the equation simplifies to:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2 )

Which can be written as:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) = ln(2 )

Multiply both sides by T1 T2 to get rid of denominators:

T1 - T2 = T1 T2 ln(2)

Hmm, rearranging:

T1 - T2 = T1 T2 ln(2 )

We can write:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / ( T1 T2 )

Which is option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So the correct equation is option D.

To solve the problem, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the population of particles in two energy levels under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The distribution is given by:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of the two energy levels, \(g_i\) and \(g_j\) are their degeneracies, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

The problem states that the excited state population in star 1 is twice that in star 2, i.e., \(n_{1,i} = 2n_{2,i}\). Assuming the degeneracies \(g_i\) and \(g_j\) are the same for both stars, the ratio of the excited-to-ground state populations for each star can be written as:

\[
\frac{n_{1,i}}{n_{1,j}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{2,i}}{n_{2,j}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Taking the ratio of these two expressions:

\[
\frac{\frac{n_{1,i}}{n_{1,j}}}{\frac{n_{2,i}}{n_{2,j}}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right)}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{n_{1,i}}{n_{2,i}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

The problem states that \(n_{1,i} = 2n_{2,i}\), so:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{\ln(2) \cdot k}{\Delta E}.
\]

Given that \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\) and \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), the right-hand side simplifies to:

\[
\frac{\ln(2) \cdot k}{\Delta E} = \ln(2).
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Multiplying through by \(T_1 T_2\) to clear the denominators:

\[
T_1 - T_2 = T_1 T_2 \ln(2).
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches **Option D**. Therefore, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]
