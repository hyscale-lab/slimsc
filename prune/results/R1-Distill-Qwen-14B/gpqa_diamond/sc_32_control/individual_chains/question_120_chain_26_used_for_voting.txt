Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about the distribution of stars and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let me try to think through this.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (p) is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the sun. The formula I recall is p (in arcseconds) is approximately equal to 1 divided by the distance d in parsecs. So p = 1/d. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So I need to find how N (number of stars) depends on the parallax plx. Let's think about the distribution.

If stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, that probably means their spatial density is uniform. So the number density of stars doesn't depend on where you look. But how does that translate into the number per unit parallax?

Hmm, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So higher parallax means closer stars. If I consider a thin shell at a distance d, the thickness of the shell would be delta d. The volume of this shell is 4πd² delta d. Since the number of stars is proportional to the volume, the number of stars in this shell would be n * 4πd² delta d, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But wait, the question is about number per unit of parallax. So perhaps I should express everything in terms of parallax and find the range of plx.

Parallax plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx. If I have a range of plx from plx to plx + delta_plx, what's the corresponding distance range? Let's see, plx changes by delta_plx. So plx = 1/d => d = 1/plx. Then delta_plx would correspond to delta_d.

But let's compute delta_d in terms of delta_plx. Since d = 1/plx, the derivative dd = -1/(plx²) * d plx. So delta_d ≈ | (delta_plx) / (plx²) ) |.

But the volume between two spherical shells is the volume of a sphere with radius d + delta_d minus the volume at d. The volume is (4/3)π (d + delta_d)^3 - (4/3)π d^3. Expanding that, approximately, it's (4/3)π [3 d² delta_d + ... ].

So the volume is about 4π d² delta_d. Then the number of stars in that volume is n * 4π d² delta_d.

But since the question is about the number per unit plx range, I need to express this in terms of plx and delta_plx.

Wait, since delta_d is (delta_plx)/(plx²), then the number of stars N between plx and plx+delta_plx is n * 4π d² * (delta_plx/(plx²)).

But d is 1/plx, so d squared is 1/(plx²). Plugging that in: N = n *4π * (1/(plx²)) * (delta_plx/(plx²)) )= n *4π * (delta_plx) / (plx^4) ).

So N is proportional to 1/plx^4. Wait, but wait, that would mean the number of stars per unit plx is decreasing as plx increases, which makes sense because closer stars (higher plx) are more numerous. Or wait, no, higher plx is closer, so more stars in a given plx range when plx is larger (since more stars are closer). Wait, no, because as plx increases (distance decreases), the number of stars in that plx range should be higher. But wait, according to this, N per unit plx is proportional to 1/(plx^4). So for larger plx (closer stars), the number per unit plx would be higher. Wait, that seems correct because more stars are nearby.

Wait, but let's think about another approach. The number of stars in a shell between d and d+delta_d is 4πd² n delta_d. If I change variables from d to plx, since plx = 1/d, then delta_plx = delta_d/(d^2) = delta_d * plx^2. So delta_d = delta_plx / plx^2.

Substituting, N = 4π d^2 n delta_d = 4π (1/plx)^2 n (delta_plx / plx^2) ) = 4π n (delta_plx) / plx^4.

So N is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx (since we're considering a delta_plx of 1, perhaps) would be 1/plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~ 1/plx^4. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, sometimes density in parallax space is discussed. The number per unit volume in phase space. Another approach: the number of stars per unit volume at a given distance is uniform, so n(r) = constant.

The number of stars in a volume element dV is n dV. The volume element in spherical shells is dV = 4π r² dr, where r is the distance. So the number per dr is 4π r² n dr.

Expressed in terms of parallax plx = 1/r. So dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. The number per dplx is N = 4π (1/plx)^2 n * (dplx / plx^2 ) = 4π n (dplx) / plx^4.

Thus, the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, which is option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember that the number of stars observed with a given parallax should roughly increase as 1/plx^3, but maybe that's when considering some other factors. Or perhaps I'm confusing this with something else.

Wait, let's consider the number of stars per unit volume in terms of parallax. Alternatively, maybe the confusion comes from the fact that the volume element in terms of parallax is different. Let me think about the differential volume in terms of parallax. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx.

So a change in plx, dplx, corresponds to a change in d. The volume between plx and plx + dplx is the volume of the sphere at radius 1/(plx) minus the sphere at radius 1/(plx + dplx). But this might get complicated. Alternatively, the differential volume element in terms of plx would be the derivative of the volume with respect to plx.

The volume up to distance d is (4/3)π d^3. So V = (4/3)π (1/plx)^3. So dV/dplx = derivative of (4/3 π) (1/plx^3) with respect to plx.

dV/dplx = (4/3 π) * (-3) (1/plx^4) ) = -4 π / plx^4.

But since the number of stars is n * V, the number per unit plx is n * dV/dplx, which would be n * (-4 π) / plx^4. The negative sign indicates increasing plx implies decreasing volume, which makes sense. But when considering a small delta_plx, the number of stars is proportional to |dV/dplx| * delta_plx, which is 4 π n / plx^4 * delta_plx.

So again, N is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the correct answer should be option A: ~1/plx^4.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely related to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density of stars \( n \) is constant. 

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( \Delta d \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, \( 4\pi d^2 \Delta d \), and the number of stars is \( N = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 \Delta d \). To express this in terms of parallax, we use \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( \Delta d = \frac{\Delta \text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} \). Substituting these into the expression for \( N \), we get:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \cdot \frac{\Delta \text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} = n \cdot \frac{4\pi \Delta \text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Thus, as parallax increases (closer stars), the number of stars per unit parallax decreases more steeply.

From the given options:
- **A) \( \sim 1/\text{plx}^4 \)**: Matches the derived result.
- **B) \( \sim 1/\text{plx}^2 \)**: Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( 1/\text{plx}^2 \).
- **C) \( \sim 1/\text{plx}^1 \)**: Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( 1/\text{plx} \).
- **D) \( \sim 1/\text{plx}^3 \)**: Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( 1/\text{plx}^3 \).

The correct answer is **A**, as the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \sim 1/\text{plx}^4 \).
