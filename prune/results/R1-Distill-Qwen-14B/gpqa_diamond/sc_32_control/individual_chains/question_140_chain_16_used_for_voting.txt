Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question again and breaking it down.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y. When they react, they release a gas W, form a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which is close to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85°C. So B is probably a substance that melts at about 4°C. I remember that water freezes at 0°C and boils at 100°C. Wait, but 277 K is actually 3.85°C. Hmm, another thought: maybe B is something like ammonium chloride? No, wait, I'm getting ahead of myself.

Let me jot down what I know.

Substance X has a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X is an element or a compound made of elements with isotopes. The reaction is violent, so maybe it's a strong acid or a base reacting exothermically.

Gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. That sounds like H2O because each H has 0 neutrons and 1 proton. Wait, but wait: in H2O, each molecule has 2 H (each with 1 proton and 0 neutrons) and 1 O (8 protons and 8 neutrons). So each molecule has (2*1 + 8) protons and (0 + 8) neutrons. Wait, 2+8=10 protons, and 8 neutrons. No, that doesn't match. Because the question says the gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the total protons in the molecule must equal the total neutrons.

Hmm. Let's think of other possibilities. Let's see, maybe CO2? That's a gas. CO2 has 1 C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and 2 O (each 8 protons, 8 neutrons). So total protons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Oh! So CO2 would have 22 protons and 22 neutrons in each molecule. That fits. So gas W is probably CO2.

Wait, but what about H2O? Wait, each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, and O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So H2O: protons = 2*1 +8=10; neutrons = 0 +8=8. 10≠8, so no. So W is CO2.

So when X reacts with Y, it releases CO2. What kind of reaction produces CO2? Maybe a carbonate reacting with an acid. For instance, if Y is an acid, and X is a carbonate.

Wait, but X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So, perhaps X is sodium carbonate, but wait, sodium's isotopes are mostly 23, but maybe it's a heavier isotope in another element.

Wait, but X is a reagent in organic chemistry. What reagents are used? Maybe something like KMnO4, but that's a salt. Or maybe it's a heavy metal isotope in something else. Alternatively, perhaps X is something like sodium dichromate or potassium something.

Alternatively, maybe X is a heavy metal with an isotope. Wait, but the reaction produces CO2. So maybe the reaction is between a carbonate and an acid. So if Y is an acid, and X is a carbonate, they react to produce CO2, water, and a salt.

Wait, but the precipitate G forms. So perhaps the reaction is between a carbonate and a metal salt that forms an insoluble product. Hmm, like adding Na2CO3 to a solution of CaCl2: CaCO3 precipitates.

Wait, but the problem states that when heated, the precipitate G releases B. So maybe G is a carbonate which when heated decomposes.

Wait, but when G is heated, B is released. If G is a carbonate, heating it would produce CO2 and a metal oxide. But B is the product. Alternatively, if G is something like a bicarbonate, heating might produce CO2 and another compound.

Wait, but the melting point of B is around 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C. So what substance has a melting point near that? Maybe ammonium chloride? Wait, no, NH4Cl has a melting point of about 177°C, I think. Or maybe something else. Wait, another thought: perhaps B is a hydrate. For instance, maybe B is a hydrate that melts at that temperature. Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound.

Wait, let me think about each part again.

Substance X reacts with Y to produce gas W (CO2), precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point around 277 K. So when G is heated, perhaps it decomposes into B and CO2. So if G is a carbonate, heating would produce the oxide and CO2. So B would be the oxide.

Wait, but the melting point of B is about 4°C, which is quite low. So what oxide has a melting point around there? Maybe something like MgO has a high melting point, but that's not it. Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound.

Wait, maybe G is a hydroxide. For example, if X is a carbonate and Y is an acid, the reaction produces CO2 and a salt. If it's a hydroxide precipitate, perhaps it's something else.

Wait, perhaps X is K2Cr2O7 (potassium dichromate), which is a strong oxidizing agent. But how does that fit in?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between a carbonate and a strong acid. For example, if Y is HCl, and X is Na2CO3. Then the reaction would be:

Na2CO3 + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + H2O + CO2↑

So the gas W is CO2, which fits. The precipitate would form if the product is insoluble, but in this case, NaCl is soluble, so no precipitate. So that's not it.

Alternatively, if Y is a solution of another salt. For instance, if Y is BaCl2 and X is Na2CO3, then the reaction would produce BaCO3 precipitate, 2 NaCl, and CO2 gas.

So the reaction would be Na2CO3 + BaCl2 → BaCO3↓ + 2 NaCl. Then, when the precipitate BaCO3 is heated, it decomposes into BaO and CO2. So the product B would be BaO.

Wait, what's the melting point of BaO? I don't remember exactly, but BaO has a high melting point, probably way above 277 K. So that's not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is something else. Maybe if Y is a solution of AgNO3 and X is Na2CO3.

Na2CO3 + 2 AgNO3 → Ag2CO3↓ + 2 NaNO3.

Wait, but Ag2CO3 isn't very stable; it might decompose. Alternatively, perhaps it forms Ag2CO3, which upon heating might release CO2 and leave Ag metal? No, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is a sulfide or something else. Hmm.

Wait, let me go back. The precipitate G releases B upon heating. If W is CO2, then during heating, G could be decomposing to a metal oxide and CO2. So the metal oxide is B.

The melting point of B is about 4°C. Hmm. Wait, I'm trying to think of a metal oxide with a low melting point. Maybe something like MgO has a high melting point, but not low. Alternatively, perhaps B is not a metal oxide but another compound.

Wait, another angle. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 O atoms. Let me think about what that could be.

A keto acid is a carboxylic acid. So if X is a reagent, perhaps it's something that adds oxygens or removes hydrogens.

Wait, another thought: when a carboxylic acid reacts with something like KMnO4 in acidic conditions, it can oxidize the acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, if the product has 2 oxygen atoms, perhaps it's a ketone. Because a carboxylic acid has -COOH, and if it loses an O, perhaps it becomes a ketone. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a CO2 molecule, but that's gas W. No, perhaps the product is a salt with certain oxygen count. Hmm, not sure yet.

Let me think about the first part again. Substance X has a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X is a molecule where one of the elements is a heavy isotope. And it's used in organic chemistry. So perhaps X is a heavy metal reagent, like potassium or something with a heavy isotope.

Wait, potassium has a common isotope, potassium-41 maybe? No, wait, potassium's main isotope is K-39. Wait, but wait: potassium's isotopes include K-39, K-40 (which has a longer half-life), K-41. K-40 has a neutron number of 21, which is heavier than K-39's 20. So maybe X is K or a compound containing K, but with a heavier isotope.

Wait, but if X is a compound like K2Cr2O7, then the heavier isotope might be in K or in Cr. But then, how would that fit into the reaction?

Alternatively, perhaps X is NaOH, but that's perhaps not using a heavy isotope. Wait, but the question says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So perhaps one of the atoms in X is a heavier isotope.

Wait, another angle: The product of a keto acid reacting with X has 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid is RCOOH. If it reacts with X to form something with 2 O's. For example, maybe it's decarboxylation, where CO2 is released. But I'm not sure.

Wait, if the product has 2 oxygen atoms, maybe it's an alcohol (with OH groups) or something else.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible options for X. The options given for the cumulative atomic masses are:

A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Wait, those are small numbers, so the elements in X must be light elements.

Wait, the question says to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X. So X contains at least two different elements, and we need to sum the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses.

Wait, for example, if X is H2O, then the elements are H and O. The lightest is H (1), the heaviest is O (16), so 1+16=17. But that's not among the options.

Wait, another possibility: X is NaOH. Sodium (23), O (16), H (1). So lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23), sum is 24. That's option B)25 is close, but not matching.

Wait, but maybe X is something like K. Potassium has a heavier isotope, but K is just a single element. But X is a substance, perhaps a compound.

Wait, perhaps X is KMnO4. Then the elements are K, Mn, O. Lightest is K (39?), no, K is about 39, Mn is 55, O is 16. Wait, K is 39, Mn is 55, O is 16. So the lightest element is O (16), the heaviest is Mn (55). So 16+55=71. Not in the options.

Hmm, maybe X is something else. Let's think of the reaction. When X reacts with Y, a carbonate perhaps, and produces CO2, precipitate, which upon heating gives B.

Wait, another approach: the melting point of B is about 277 K, which is about 4°C. What substance has a melting point near that? I think ammonium nitrate has a melting point around 169°C, but that's not it. Wait, maybe something like ice? No, ice melts at 273 K (0°C). Hmm, but B's melting point is 277 K, which is a bit higher, so maybe a different type of ice or a hydrated salt.

Wait, another thought: perhaps B is a hydrate. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate has a certain melting point, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate G is sodium bicarbonate. When heated, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. So B would be Na2CO3. What's the melting point of Na2CO3? I think it's about 854°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that can't be it.

Hmm. Maybe B is another compound. Let's think of what else releases CO2 when heated. Maybe a metal carbonate. Wait, perhaps B is a metal oxide, but I need to find one with a melting point near 277 K.

Wait, another angle: The product of a keto acid with X has 2 O atoms. Let's say the keto acid is something like acetic acid (CH3COOH). When it reacts with X, perhaps it loses a CO2 group, leaving something with 2 O atoms.

Wait, acetic acid has two oxygen atoms in the COOH group. If it reacts in a way that forms a product with 2 O's, perhaps it's decarboxylation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an oxidation. For example, if acetic acid (CH3COOH) is oxidized by X (like KMnO4) in acidic conditions, it can form CO2. But wait, the product would be CO2, which is gas W, but the product of the reaction (the other product) would be something else. Hmm, not sure.

Let me try to think of X as a heavy metal with a heavier isotope, perhaps in a compound. For example, potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) is used in organic chemistry as an oxidizing agent. So X could be K2Cr2O7.

Then, in the reaction with Y (maybe a carbonate), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid, and the reaction produces CO2.

Wait, but X is a reagent in organic chemistry. KMnO4 is commonly used as an oxidizing agent. So maybe X is KMnO4.

So, when KMnO4 reacts with an acid, perhaps it produces MnO2 and other products. Let's think:

In acidic conditions, KMnO4 (a strong oxidizing agent) reacts with something. For example, if Y is HCl, then the reaction would be:

KMnO4 + HCl → MnCl2 + Cl2↑ + KCl + H2O

Wait, but that produces Cl2 gas, not CO2. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but maybe Y is something else. If Y is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, then:

KMnO4 + Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → K2SO4 + Na2SO4 + MnSO4 + CO2↑ + H2O.

In this case, CO2 is produced as gas W. The precipitate G could be MnSO4, but I'm not sure if it's insoluble. Alternatively, perhaps in some conditions, a precipitate forms. But I'm not certain about that.

Wait, when KMnO4 is heated with a carbonate, maybe it produces MnO2 and CO2. For example:

Heating KMnO4 with Na2CO3 might lead to the formation of MnO2, K2CO3, and Na2MnO4, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces MnO2 and CO2. So if G is MnO2, and when heated, it doesn't decompose further. But MnO2's melting point is around 1400°C, so that doesn't fit B's melting point.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let's try another approach.

Since the precipitate G when heated releases B, and B has a low melting point, perhaps G is a bicarbonate. For example, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) would decompose upon heating to Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But then B would be Na2CO3, which has a high melting point, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps B is a hydrate. For example, calcium carbonate hexahydrate or something. But I don't know the melting points of such compounds.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the melting point of B. 277 K is about 4°C. What substances have a melting point around there? Maybe something like a hydrate, like MgSO4·7H2O has a melting point of about 26°C, but that's not it. Alternatively, maybe ammonium chloride, NH4Cl, which has a melting point around 177°C. No, that's too high.

Wait, maybe B is a different compound. Could it be something like NaNO3? Sodium nitrate's melting point is around 300°C, which is higher than 277 K. Not quite.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to think of B as something that's a byproduct of the decomposition of G. If G is a carbonate, say CaCO3, heating would produce CaO and CO2, but CaO's melting point is high.

Wait, maybe B is CO2? No, because CO2 is a gas at standard conditions. Hmm.

Maybe I should consider that B is a solid with a low melting point. Perhaps something like a sublimed solid? Or maybe it's a different kind of compound.

Wait, another approach: the precipitate G is formed when X reacts with Y. Let's suppose X is Na2CO3 and Y is a solution of a metal nitrate. Then, the reaction would produce a metal carbonate precipitate. For example, Na2CO3 + Ca(NO3)2 → CaCO3↓ + 2 NaNO3.

So G would be CaCO3. Upon heating, CaCO3 decomposes into CaO and CO2. Then B would be CaO. What's the melting point of CaO? I think it's around 2880°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the elements in X. X has a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Let's say X is H2O, but that's probably not the case. Alternatively, X could be something like C with a heavy isotope, but that's an element, not a compound.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound where one of the elements is carbon with a heavier isotope, like C-13 or C-14. But that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule, like O2 or N2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. Let's say the keto acid is propionic acid (CH2CH2COOH). If X is something like O2, then in oxidation, the acid could lose CO2, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a base that deprotonates the acid, forming a salt with two oxygen atoms. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think about the elements in X. The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X sum to one of the options: 35,25,31,29.

For example, if X is KNO3, the elements are K (39), N (14), O (16). The lightest is N (14), heaviest K (39). 14+39=53, not an option.

If X is NaOH, elements are Na (23), O (16), H (1). Lightest H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum is 24. Not in options.

If X is CO2, elements are C (12), O (16). Lightest C (12), heaviest O (16). Sum 28. Not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is CH3COOH (acetic acid), but that's a compound with C, H, O. Lightest is H (1), heaviest C (12). Sum is 13, not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound with two elements, like HCl. Then, elements are H (1) and Cl (35.5). Sum is 36.5, which is close to option C (31) but not exact. Hmm.

Wait, but the options are given as integers, so maybe they're using integer masses for the atomic weights. So H is 1, Cl is 35 (assuming Cl-35). So sum would be 36. Not matching any option.

Another possibility: X is a compound containing C and O, like CO. Then, lightest C (12), heaviest O (16). Sum 28. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule like O2. Then, it's just O. But that's a single element, so no heaviest or lightest, just same element. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps X is NH3. Elements N (14) and H (1). Sum 15. Not an option.

Another thought: X could be a heavy isotope of hydrogen, like deuterium, but that's in compounds like D2O. So if X is D2O, the elements are D (1, same as H) and O (16). Sum 17, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Maybe X is a different compound. Let me consider the options again.

The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Wait, perhaps X contains two elements, and their atomic masses sum to one of these.

For example:

If X is CO (carbon monoxide), then C (12) and O (16). Sum 28. Not an option.

If X is NO (nitric oxide), N (14) and O (16). Sum 30. Close to option D (29), but not matching.

Wait, but the sum is 14+16=30. Not 29. So maybe not.

Wait, what about X is NO2 (nitrogen dioxide)? Then N (14) and O (16). Sum is 30 again.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with two elements whose atomic masses sum to one of the options.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 29. Let's think of two elements whose atomic masses sum to 29.

Possible pairs:

O (16) + something: 16 +13=29. 13 is Al. So Al and O, like Al2O3? But Al is 27, O is 16. So 27+16=43, which is not 29.

Alternatively, 29 could be 23 (Na) + 6 (C). So Na and C. So X could be NaC. But that's not a common compound.

Wait, 29: 12 (C) +17 (Cl) = 29. So Cl is 35.5. Hmm, but 12+35.5=47.5, which doesn't fit. Wait, another approach: perhaps using the lightest and heaviest isotopes.

Wait, let me think of possible pairs:

If the lightest element has atomic mass A, and the heaviest has B, then A + B equals one of the options.

Looking at the options:

Option D:29.

Possible A and B:

- H (1) + something: 1 +28=29. But 28 is S (32.07), no. Or maybe it's another element.

Wait, 12 (C) +17 (Cl) would be 29. Wait, 12 +17=29. So if X has C and Cl, sum is 29. But Cl is 35.5. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe it's O (16) +13 (Al). 16+13=29. So Al and O.

If X is Al2O3, then the elements are Al (27) and O (16). Sum 27+16=43. Not matching.

Wait, maybe X is something like AlO, but that's not a common compound.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule with two different elements. For example, NO (N and O). N is 14, O is 16. Sum 30. Not matching.

Another thought: if X is a compound with elements where the heavier isotope is present. For instance, if X is H2O, but with a heavy O isotope like O-18. But that doesn't change the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements, which are H (1) and O (16). Sum 17, not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound with elements where the lightest is H and the heaviest is, say, Cl. So 1 +35=36. Close, but not an option.

Alternatively, maybe the elements are O (16) and F (19). 16+19=35. Option A is 35.

So if X contains O and F, the sum would be 16+19=35. So maybe X is something like OF2 or similar.

Wait, but what reactions would OF2 be involved in? I'm not sure, but let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps X is ClO2. Then, Cl (35.5) and O (16). Sum 35.5+16=51.5, which is not an option.

Hmm. Another angle: the product of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. Let's think of a keto acid, say, formic acid (HCOOH). If X reacts to form something with 2 O's, perhaps it forms H2O. But that's gas W. Or maybe it forms something else.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a base that reacts with the acid to form a salt with 2 oxygens. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. For example, if X is a dehydrating agent, like PCl5, and the reaction converts the keto acid into a ketone. But then, the product would have a different structure.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to tie this together.

If the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses in X is one of the options, and I'm considering X as a compound that reacts to produce CO2, perhaps X is something like Na2CO3. But Na is 23, C is 12, O is 16. So the lightest is C (12), heaviest Na (23). Sum 12+23=35, which is option A. Hmm, that's an option.

Wait, but then X would be Na2CO3. Does that fit?

So, if X is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), let's see:

Reaction with Y (maybe an acid like HCl) produces CO2 gas, and a precipitate if Y is a solution of a metal carbonate. Wait, but in this case, Y would be an acid, and the reaction would produce NaCl, H2O, and CO2. No precipitate in that reaction, so perhaps Y is a solution of a metal carbonate that produces a precipitate.

Wait, maybe Y is a solution of CaCl2. Then, Na2CO3 + CaCl2 → CaCO3↓ + 2 NaCl. So the precipitate G is CaCO3. When heated, CaCO3 → CaO + CO2↑. So B would be CaO. What's the melting point of CaO? I think it's about 2880°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. So if X is Na2CO3, the sum of the lightest (C, 12) and heaviest (Na, 23) elements is 35, which is option A. But does the rest fit?

But then, the product of a keto acid with X would have 2 oxygen atoms. Say, acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacting with Na2CO3 would produce CO2 and sodium acetate. Sodium acetate is CH3COONa, which has two O's in the COO- group. So perhaps that's the product. So yes, it has 2 O atoms.

So that fits. Also, X (Na2CO3) is a reagent in organic chemistry, often used in reactions like saponification.

Wait, but then what about the precipitate when X reacts with Y? If Y is CaCl2, then G is CaCO3, which upon heating would produce CaO (melting point too high). So B is CaO, which doesn't fit the melting point. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of AgNO3. So Na2CO3 + 2 AgNO3 → Ag2CO3 + 2 NaNO3. But Ag2CO3 is not very stable; it might decompose, but if it precipitates, then upon heating, it might decompose into AgO and CO2. So B would be AgO. What's the melting point of AgO? I'm not sure, but it's possible that it's lower. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of Pb(NO3)2. Then, Na2CO3 + Pb(NO3)2 → PbCO3↓ + 2 NaNO3. PbCO3 upon heating decomposes into PbO and CO2. PbO's melting point is about 890°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but the sum of the elements in X (Na2CO3) is 35, which is option A.

But then, the melting point of B is 277 K, which is about 4°C. So perhaps B is another compound. Let me think: what if B is something like ammonium formate or another compound that decomposes upon heating and has a low melting point.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the precipitate G is sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3. When heated, it decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But then B would be Na2CO3, which has a high melting point. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me recap:

- Gas W is CO2, as that's the only option that fits the neutron and proton count.

- X reacts with Y to produce CO2 and a precipitate G.

- G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point around 4°C.

- The product of X with a keto acid contains 2 O atoms.

- X contains a heavier isotope of one of its elements and is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.

- The sum of lightest and heaviest elements in X is one of the options given.

If I consider X as Na2CO3, the sum is 12 (C) + 23 (Na) = 35, which is option A. But then B's melting point doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Let's think of another compound.

Wait, another possibility: X is K2CO3. So the elements are K (39), C (12), O (16). Sum of lightest (C, 12) and heaviest (K, 39) is 51. Not an option.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps X is a diatomic molecule with two heavier isotopes. For example, if X is D2O (deuterium oxide). Then, the elements are H (1) and O (16). Sum is 17. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid). The elements are C (12), H (1), O (16). Lightest is H, heaviest C. Sum 13. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a heavy metal chloride. For example, if X is AgCl. Sum of elements Ag (108) and Cl (35.5) is 143.5. Not an option.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible options again.

The options are 35,25,31,29.

Wait, another possibility: if X is a compound containing C and O, like CO (atomic masses 12 +16=28, not option). Or maybe it's a different combination.

Wait, another thought: the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So if X is HCl, then H (1) and Cl (35.5). Sum 36.5, which is approximately 35.5, but the options don't have that. Or maybe using exact integer values, 1 + 35=36, which isn't an option either.

Alternatively, maybe X is NH4Cl. Then, N (14), H (1), Cl (35.5). Lightest H (1), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum 36.5, which again doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps X is CH4O, like methanol. Then, C (12), H (1), O (16). Sum 12+16=28. Not an option.

Wait, another angle: the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X contains 2 O atoms. So if the product is something like H2O, which has one O, but perhaps in a salt. Or maybe it's an ester or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, which has one O in the carbonyl group. But the question says 2 O atoms. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is an ether, which has two O's? No, that's not right. Ethers have one O. Wait, maybe a carbonate? No, that's three O's.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carboxylic acid after some reaction, but that has two O's in the COOH group. Wait, no, COOH has two O's in the carbonyl and one in the hydroxyl, making three O's.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but maybe I should go with the earlier thought that X is Na2CO3, leading to a sum of 35 (option A), even though the melting point doesn't fit perfectly.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Let me think of X as something else.

Wait, another possibility: X is KNO3. Then, K (39), N (14), O (16). Sum of lightest N (14) and heaviest K (39) is 53. Not an option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a compound with elements whose atomic masses are 15 and 14. So sum is 29 (option D). 15 could be P (30.97), which is close to 31, but that's not matching.

Wait, 15 is the atomic mass of phosphorus (about 30.97), but maybe it's being approximated. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps elements are N (14) and O (16), sum 30, which is close to option D (29). Hmm, but not exact.

Wait, another angle: the product of the reaction between a keto acid and X contains two atoms of oxygen. Let's say the product is a ketone, which has one O. No, that's one O. So maybe something else.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester. Esters have two O's in the carbonyl and ester groups. For example, an ester would have two O's: one in the carbonyl and one in the ester oxygen. So that fits.

So if X is an acid catalyst, like H2SO4, then the reaction would form an ester from the keto acid and an alcohol. But then, X would be H2SO4, which doesn't have a heavy isotope necessarily.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a base, like NaOH. Then, the reaction would form a carboxylate salt. For example, CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO−Na+ + H2O. The product is sodium acetate, which has two O's in the acetate ion. So yes, that fits.

So, if X is NaOH, then the elements are Na (23), O (16), H (1). The lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum is 24. Not an option.

Hmm. But wait, if X is NaOH, which is used in organic chemistry as a base, and when it reacts with a keto acid, it produces a salt with two O's, like sodium acetate.

But earlier, when X was Na2CO3, the sum was 35, which is option A. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

Putting it all together, despite the confusion about B's melting point, the sum of 12 (C) and 23 (Na) in Na2CO3 gives 35, which is option A.

The problem involves identifying Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts with Liquid Y to produce Gas W (CO₂), a Precipitate G, and ultimately yields a compound B upon heating G. The melting point of B is approximately 277 K (4°C). Additionally, the product of a keto acid reacting with X contains 2 oxygen atoms, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. The task is to determine the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W (CO₂):**  
   CO₂ is identified as Gas W because its molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons (12 protons and 12 neutrons). This fits the description of W.

2. **Reaction of X with Y:**  
   X reacts violently with Y to produce CO₂ and a precipitate G. This suggests X could be a carbonate (e.g., Na₂CO₃ or K₂CO₃), as carbonates react with acids to release CO₂ and form salts.

3. **Precipitate G and Heating to B:**  
   When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point of approximately 277 K (4°C). If G is a carbonate (e.g., CaCO₃ or Na₂CO₃), heating would produce a metal oxide (e.g., CaO or Na₂O) and CO₂. However, the melting point of B (4°C) does not match typical metal oxides, which have much higher melting points. This discrepancy suggests further refinement is needed.

4. **Product of Keto Acid with X:**  
   The product of a keto acid reacting with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. For example, if X is Na₂CO₃ and the keto acid is acetic acid (CH₃COOH), the reaction produces sodium acetate (CH₃COO⁻Na⁺), which contains 2 oxygen atoms in the acetate ion.

5. **Atomic Masses of Elements in X:**  
   If X is Na₂CO₃, the elements are Na (23), C (12), and O (16). The lightest element is C (12), and the heaviest is Na (23). The cumulative atomic masses of these elements sum to 12 + 23 = 35.

6. **Matching the Options:**  
   The sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X (35) matches **Option A**. While there are uncertainties about the exact nature of B and its melting point, the reasoning aligns with the given clues and constraints.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X correspond to **Option A**.
