Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: We have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. We need to calculate two things: the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and the average value of that operator.

The operator in question has a matrix representation Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, so what does that matrix look like? Let's think about a 2x2 system because we're dealing with spin up and down states. So the matrix would be:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Because when i ≠ j, the element is hbar/2, else zero. So it's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal.

Wait, but this looks familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A would be (hbar/2) * X. So the operator A is (hbar/2) multiplied by the Pauli X matrix. So when you measure this operator, the possible eigenvalues are ± hbar/2 because the eigenvalues of Pauli X are ±1, so multiplied by hbar/2 gives those as the eigenvalues.

But wait, the question is about the eigenstates of this operator. Oh, wait no, wait. The operator's eigenstates would correspond to the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of Pauli X, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Because the Pauli X swaps the spin states.

So, to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, and then the coefficients' squared magnitudes will give the probabilities.

But wait, first, the initial state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let me write that out. Let's compute the normalization factor first because the state is only given up to a proportionality constant.

The vector in the |up> and |down> basis is [1+i, 2-i]. The normalization factor is the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each component. So the norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2.

Calculating each term:

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the total norm squared is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> multiplied by 1/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down> .

Now, I need to write this state in terms of the eigenstates of the operator A. Let me denote |+> and |-> as the eigenstates of A (eigenvalues +hbar/2 and -hbar/2 respectively). So,

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),
|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

We can express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+> and |->.

So let's write |alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->.

Expressing |+> and |-> in terms of |up> and |down>:

c_+ = < + | alpha >,
c_- = < - | alpha >.

Let me compute c_+ and c_-.

First, compute c_+.

< + | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

So this is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (1+i) <down|up> + (2 -i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|down> ].

Wait, inner products: <up|up> is 1, <down|down> is 1. <up|down> is zero because they're orthogonal.

So this simplifies to (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i)(1) + (2 -i)(1) ].

So [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] = (1 +2) + (i -i ) = 3 + 0i =3.

So c_+ = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, compute c_-.

c_- = < - | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| - <down| ) * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

So,

(1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) <up|up> - (1+i) <down|up> + (2 -i) <up|down> - (2 -i) <down|down> ]

Again, the inner products:

<up|up> is 1, <down|down> is 1, others are zero.

So,

(1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i)(1) - (2 -i)(1) ]

= [ (1 +i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14)

= [ (1-2) + (i +i) ] / sqrt(14)

= [ (-1) + 2i ] / sqrt(14)

Hmm, so c_+ = 3/sqrt(14), c_- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, but let me check: the calculation for c_-:

Wait, let me recompute:

< - | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) * <up|up> - (1+i) <down|up> + (2 -i) <up|down> - (2 -i) <down|down> ]

Which becomes (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)*1 - (2-i)*1 ] because <down|up> is 0 and <up|down> is 0.

So it's (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 -2) + i + i ]

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1 + 2i ]

So, yeah, c_- = [ -1 + 2i ] / sqrt(2*7) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Now, the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

So compute |c_+|^2 = |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, |c_-|^2 = | (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14) |^2.

The numerator squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1+4=5. So |c_-|^2 =5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, but wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857 and 5/14 is approximately 0.35714. Hmm, but looking at the options, the probabilities are either 0.64, 0.36 or 0.54, 0.46, etc.

So 9/14 is about 0.6428, which is about 0.64 when rounded. 5/14 is approximately 0.3571, which is about 0.36 when rounded. So the probabilities would be approximately 64% and 36% for the two eigenstates.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A lists 0.64 and 0.36, but their average is hbar/7. But let me think about the average value of the operator.

The operator A has eigenvalues ±hbar/2. The expectation value is given by <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is expressed in terms of |+> and |->, with coefficients c_+ and c_-, the expectation value is c_+ c_-^* (hbar/2) + c_- c_+^* (-hbar/2). Or perhaps more accurately, since A is diagonal in the |+> and |-> basis, the expectation value is the sum over the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues.

Wait no, because |+> has eigenvalue hbar/2 and |-> has eigenvalue -hbar/2.

So the expectation value would be |c_+|^2 * (hbar/2) + |c_-|^2 * (-hbar/2).

We have |c_+|^2 =9/14, |c_-|^2=5/14.

So <A> = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)*(-hbar/2) = [ (9 -5) hbar ] / (2*14) ) = (4 hbar) / 28 = hbar /7.

So the expectation is hbar/7. So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36), and the expectation is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So the average is hbar/7, which is the first option.

Wait, but let me double-check the expectation value calculation. Another way: since the operator is A = (hbar/2)(|up><down| + |down><up| ), and the state |alpha> is (1+i |up> + (2-i)|down> ) / sqrt(7).

So <A> = (hbar/2) [ <alpha| up><down| alpha> + <alpha| down><up| alpha> ]

Compute each term:

First, <alpha| up> is [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7) ] because |alpha> is (1+i |up> + ... ) / sqrt(7), so the bra is (1-i, 2+i)/sqrt(7).

Similarly, <alpha| down> is (2 +i)/sqrt(7).

So first term: <alpha| up><down| alpha> = [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

Wait, no: wait, <down| alpha> is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So <alpha| up> is (1 -i)/sqrt(7), because the conjugate of (1+i) is (1-i).

So the first term is (1 - i)(2 - i) /7.

Second term: <alpha| down> is (2 +i)/sqrt(7), and <up| alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7).

So the second term is (2 +i)(1 +i) /7.

So <A> = (hbar/2) [ ( (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) ) /7 ]

Compute numerator:

(1-i)(2-i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i +i² = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

(2+i)(1+i)= 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i = 2 +2i +i +i² = 2 +3i -1 =1 +3i.

So adding these:

(1-3i) + (1+3i) = 2.

So <A> = (hbar/2) [ 2 /7 ] = (hbar/2) * (2/7) ) = hbar/7.

Which matches our previous calculation. So that's correct.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the expectation is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64,0.36, and hbar/7. So that's the correct option.

Wait a second—let me check the options again.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7 → yes.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29 → that's not matching our 0.64 and 0.36.

So the correct answer should be option A.

The problem involves an electron state |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, where |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator A, whose matrix representation is given by Aij = hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of A must be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |alpha>
The state |alpha> is given as (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. To normalize it, calculate the norm squared:
\[
\| |alpha\rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|up\rangle + (2-i)|down\rangle \right).
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator A
The operator A has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, and its eigenstates are:
\[
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |up\rangle + |down\rangle \right), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |up\rangle - |down\rangle \right),
\]
with eigenvalues \(+\hbar/2\) and \(-\hbar/2\), respectively.

### Step 3: Express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |-> 
To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates |+> and |->, express |alpha> as a linear combination of these states:
\[
|alpha\rangle = c_+ |+\rangle + c_- |-\rangle.
\]
The coefficients \(c_+\) and \(c_-\) are calculated as:
\[
c_+ = \langle + | alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
c_- = \langle - | alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate probabilities
The probabilities of measuring |+> and |-> are the squared magnitudes of \(c_+\) and \(c_-\), respectively:
\[
P(+\rangle) = |c_+|^2 = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64,
\]
\[
P(-\rangle) = |c_-|^2 = \left| \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the average value of A
The expectation value of A is given by:
\[
\langle A \rangle = |c_+|^2 \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + |c_-|^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substituting the probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{9\hbar}{28} - \frac{5\hbar}{28} = \frac{4\hbar}{28} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 6: Match with the options
The probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is \(\hbar/7\). This matches **Option A**.
