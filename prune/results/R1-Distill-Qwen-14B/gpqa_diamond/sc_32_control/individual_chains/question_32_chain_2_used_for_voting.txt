Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number is 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6. So the nucleus is Li-6. Got it.

I remember from my studies that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we have to use the relativistic energy equations. The energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity of the particle.

The formula for gamma is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed here is 0.96c, let me calculate gamma first.

Wait, let's plug in v = 0.96c. So v² is (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c². Then 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, calculating that exactly: 0.28 squared is 0.0784, but I'm taking the square root. Let me compute it more accurately. 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.57142857...

But wait, let me make sure. Because 0.28 is 28/100, which is 7/25. So 1/(7/25) is 25/7 ≈ 3.5714. Yep, that's correct.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The rest mass energy is m*c². I need to find the mass of Li-6.

Wait, the mass of a lithium-6 nucleus. Lithium has an atomic number of 3, and the isotope is 6, so 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass can be found using the mass formula, but maybe I can remember that the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². Let me look up the exact numbers.

Wait, I think the proton mass is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², and the neutron is around 939.565 MeV/c². But wait, maybe it's better to look up the exact mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it as the sum of the individual nucleons.

So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the total rest mass would be:

3 * m_p + 3 * m_n = 3(m_p + m_n)

But wait, wait, when you have a nucleus, the mass is actually less than the sum of the individual nucleons due to binding energy. Oh right, but in this case, are we considering the rest mass of the nucleus, or the sum of the nucleons? Because the problem states it's the nucleus X, so I think we have to use the actual mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the mass of a single nucleon (like the average of protons and neutrons) multiplied by the number of nucleons, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the problem expects to use the mass of a proton as the average. Or perhaps it's given in some standard way. Alternatively, the problem might be using the mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) as about 938 MeV/c², but this is an approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons, ignoring binding energy. Let's think about that.

Calculating the mass of Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So each proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², each neutron about 939.565 MeV/c².

So 3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV
3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV
Total is 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV.

But wait, Li-6's actual mass is less than this because of the mass defect due to binding energy. But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps they expect us to use the sum of the individual masses, ignoring the binding energy. Or maybe they give a standard value for the mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the concept of the mass number A to approximate the mass as A * (mass of a nucleon). The mass of a nucleon is roughly about 938 MeV/c². So for Li-6, A=6, so mass is 6 * 938 MeV/c² = 5628 MeV.

But maybe I should look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, I think the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6 * 938.272 MeV/c² minus the binding energy. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the rest mass is approximately 6 * 938 MeV/c², which is 5628 MeV.

Wait, let me think. The exact mass of ^6Li is 5633.75 MeV/c². Wait, but that includes the binding energy loss, right? No, wait, the rest mass of the nucleus is the sum of the rest masses of the nucleons minus the binding energy (because binding energy is released when the nucleus forms, so the nucleus is less massive than the sum).

So for example, let me compute:

Number of protons: 3. Each proton has a mass of approximately 938.272 MeV/c².

Number of neutrons: 3. Each neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c².

So sum of individual masses: 3 * (938.272 + 939.565) = 3*(1877.837) = 5633.511 MeV/c².

The actual mass of ^6Li is 5633.511 MeV/c² minus the binding energy. What is the binding energy for ^6Li? I think the binding energy per nucleon for light nuclei is lower than for heavier ones. Let me recall some figures.

For example, for helium-4, the binding energy is about 28 MeV, so about 7 MeV per nucleon. For carbon-12, it's higher, like around 12 MeV per nucleon.

Wait, but perhaps I can look up the binding energy of ^6Li. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to recall that the actual mass of ^6Li is about 5633.511 MeV minus the binding energy. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses an approximation where the mass is taken as the sum, ignoring the binding energy. Because including binding energy would complicate things, and perhaps the problem expects us to proceed without it.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects to use the mass of a single nucleon, like 938 MeV/c², multiplied by 6, so 5628 MeV.

Wait, but perhaps I can proceed with the given information. Let me proceed under the assumption that the mass of the nucleus is approximately 6 * 938 MeV/c² = 5628 MeV. But wait, I think the actual mass is higher than that because the sum of the individual nucleon masses is higher than the nucleus's mass. Wait no, the sum is higher because the nucleus has a lower mass due to binding energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects to model the nucleus as a single particle with mass equal to 6 times the proton mass plus 3 times the neutron mass, but that's a bit unclear.

Wait, maybe I should look for the actual mass of Li-6. Let me think. I remember that the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.015 atomic mass units. Oh wait, but wait, the atomic mass includes electrons as well. So the nucleus mass would be the atomic mass minus the electrons.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me try to find the mass of Li-6 in MeV/c².

I think the mass of ^6Li is approximately 5633.511 MeV/c² minus the binding energy. Let me compute the binding energy.

Wait, the binding energy for Li-6 is about 7.59 MeV. So the actual mass of the nucleus would be 5633.511 MeV/c² minus 7.59 MeV. So about 5625.92 MeV/c².

Wait, that might be more accurate. Alternatively, perhaps I should find the exact value.

Wait, another approach: the mass of ^6Li is 5633.511 MeV/c² minus the binding energy. But the exact binding energy can be found from the mass defect.

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the problem using the given data.

Wait, but perhaps the problem doesn't require the exact mass but just the formula. Let me see.

The problem is to find the energy of the RHIC, which accelerates these nuclei. The energy of each nucleus in the collider would be gamma times m c².

So the energy E is gamma * m * c².

So gamma is approximately 3.5714 as calculated earlier.

So I need to find m, the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

If I can find m, then E is gamma * m * c².

But wait, I think m is given in the problem, but perhaps I need to compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the rest mass is the sum of the masses of the individual nucleons. So 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So m = (3 m_p + 3 m_n)/c².

But then the mass in energy terms is m c² = 3 (m_p c² + m_n c²).

Wait, but m_p and m_n are in MeV/c², right? So m_p c^2 is just m_p in MeV.

So m_p is approximately 938.272 MeV, m_n is about 939.565 MeV.

So 3*(938.272 + 939.565) = 3 * (1877.837) = 5633.511 MeV.

So the rest mass energy of the nucleus is 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.633511 GeV.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

So E = gamma * (5.633511 GeV) = 3.5714 * 5.633511 GeV.

Let me compute that.

First, 3.5714 * 5 = 17.857 GeV.

3.5714 * 0.633511 = let's compute that.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute 3.5714 * 5.633511.

Alternatively, perhaps compute 3.5714 * 5.633511.

Let me compute 3.5714 * 5.633511:

3.5714 * 5 = 17.857

3.5714 * 0.633511.

Compute 3.5714 * 0.6 = 2.14284

3.5714 * 0.033511 ≈ 3.5714 * 0.033 = 0.1178562, and 3.5714 * 0.000511 ≈ 0.001830. So approximately 0.119686.

So 2.14284 + 0.119686 ≈ 2.2625.

So total is 17.857 + 2.2625 ≈ 20.1195 GeV.

Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. That's pretty close. So perhaps that's the correct answer.

Wait, but perhaps I made some approximation in the gamma calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, v is 0.96c. So beta is 0.96. So gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784).

Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784.

So 1/0.28 is exactly 3.57142857...

So gamma is exactly 35/10 divided by 2.8/10? Wait, wait, 0.28 is 28/100 = 7/25. So 1/(7/25) is 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.

So gamma is 25/7.

So 25/7 * 5.633511 GeV.

Let me compute 5.633511 * 25 = 140.837775.

Divide by 7: 140.837775 /7 ≈ ?

Compute 7 * 20 = 140. So 140.837775 -140 = 0.837775.

0.837775 /7 ≈ 0.11968214.

So total is 20.119682 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV.

Our calculation gives approximately 20.1197 GeV, which is very close to option C (20.132 GeV). So perhaps that's the correct answer.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Let me check that again.

Wait, I assumed m = 3*(m_p + m_n) /c², but perhaps that's not correct because the actual mass of the nucleus is a bit less due to binding energy. So if the actual mass is lower, then gamma * m would be lower.

Wait, if the actual mass is 5625.92 MeV (as I thought earlier), then m c² is 5625.92 MeV = 5.62592 GeV.

Then E = (25/7) * 5.62592 GeV.

Compute 25/7 *5.62592.

25/7 is about 3.5714.

So 5.62592 *3.5714.

Hmm, 5 *3.5714 is 17.857.

0.62592 *3.5714 ≈ 2.234.

Total is 20.091 GeV.

Which is even closer to option C (20.132 GeV). But not exactly matching.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

So m c² is 5.62592 GeV.

25/7 = 3.57142857.

So 5.62592 * 3.57142857.

Let me compute this exactly:

5.62592 * 3.57142857.

Break it down:

5 * 3.57142857 = 17.85714285

0.62592 * 3.57142857.

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857 = 2.14285714

0.02592 *3.57142857 ≈ 0.092454545.

So 2.14285714 +0.092454545 ≈ 2.235311685.

So total is 17.85714285 + 2.235311685 ≈ 20.0924545 GeV.

That's approximately 20.0925 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C (20.132 GeV), which is about 20.132. The difference is about 0.04 GeV, which is 40 MeV, which seems a bit significant. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of the binding energy. Maybe the actual binding energy is less, making the mass higher than 5.62592 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the individual nucleons, ignoring the binding energy. So m c² =5.633511 GeV.

Then E = 25/7 *5.633511.

Compute 5.633511 * 25 = 140.837775.

Divide by 7: 140.837775 /7 = 20.119682 GeV.

So approximately 20.1197 GeV, which is about 20.12 GeV. The options have option C at 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects more precise calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the mass of the proton and neutron.

Let me look up the exact values.

The proton mass is approximately 938.272 MeV/c².

The neutron mass is approximately 939.565 MeV/c².

So 3*(938.272 +939.565) =3*(1877.837) = 5633.511 MeV.

But the actual mass of ^6Li is less than this by the binding energy. The binding energy for ^6Li is about 7.59 MeV.

So the actual mass is 5633.511 MeV -7.59 MeV = 5625.921 MeV, which is 5.625921 GeV.

So m c² =5.625921 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² = (25/7) *5.625921 GeV.

Compute 5.625921 * (25/7) = (5.625921 *25)/7.

5.625921 *25 = 140.648025.

Divide by 7: 140.648025 /7 =20.092575 GeV.

So approximately 20.0926 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher.

Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the way I'm calculating the energy.

Wait another thought: maybe the problem is referring to the total energy of the nucleus, which includes both kinetic and rest mass energy. Or perhaps the energy is already given as the kinetic energy. No, wait, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC", which is the total energy each nucleus is accelerated to.

Wait, no, the RHIC's energy is the kinetic energy, or the total energy? I think in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, it's the kinetic energy, but actually, no, wait, in colliders, the energy usually refers to the total energy (kinetic + rest mass). Or perhaps it's the kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no, RHIC accelerates heavy ions to high speeds, and the energy is given as the total energy (gamma m c²). Because when physicists discuss the energy of an accelerator, it's the total energy, not just the kinetic. For example, the LHC's energy is given as the total energy, which is the sum of rest mass and kinetic.

So the correct approach is to calculate gamma multiplied by m c², which is the total energy.

So then, using the more precise calculation, the energy is approximately 20.0926 GeV. The options given are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV.

Our calculation is approximately 20.0926 GeV, which is very close to option C, which is 20.132 GeV. The difference is about 0.04 GeV, which is 40 MeV. That's a 0.2% difference, which might be due to more precise values of the masses.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the proton and neutron masses.

Let me look up the exact values.

Proton mass: m_p = 938.272 MeV/c².

Neutron mass: m_n = 939.565 MeV/c².

So m = 3*(m_p + m_n) = 3*(938.272 + 939.565) =3*(1877.837) =5633.511 MeV.

Now, the actual mass of ^6Li is m_actual =5633.511 MeV/c² minus the binding energy.

The binding energy for ^6Li is approximately 7.59 MeV.

So m_actual =5633.511 MeV/c² -7.59 MeV/c² =5625.921 MeV/c².

So m c² =5625.921 MeV =5.625921 GeV.

Gamma is 25/7 ≈3.57142857.

So E =3.57142857 *5.625921 GeV.

Let me compute this precisely:

5.625921 *3.57142857.

Let me compute it step by step.

5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285

0.625921 *3.57142857.

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857 =2.14285714.

0.025921 *3.57142857 ≈0.092454.

So adding those gives 2.14285714 +0.092454 =2.235311.

Adding to the 17.85714285 gives 17.85714285 +2.235311 ≈20.09245385 GeV.

So approximately 20.0925 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 20.132. The difference is about 0.04 GeV, which is 40 MeV. That's a 0.2% difference. It's possible that the problem expects us to ignore the binding energy, leading to m c²=5.6335 GeV, which when multiplied by gamma gives 20.1197 GeV, which is closer to 20.12 GeV. But the option is 20.132, which is still a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is taken as the mass of a single nucleon times 6. Let's try that.

Assume each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a mass of 938.272 MeV/c² (proton) and 939.565 MeV/c² (neutron). Let me take an average, say 938.7 MeV/c². Then 6 *938.7 MeV =5632.2 MeV =5.6322 GeV.

Then E =3.5714 *5.6322 GeV.

Compute 5.6322 *3.5714.

Again, 5 *3.5714 =17.857.

0.6322 *3.5714.

0.6 *3.5714=2.1428.

0.0322 *3.5714≈0.1149.

So total is 2.1428 +0.1149=2.2577.

Adding to 17.857 gives 20.1147 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1147 GeV. Closer to 20.115 GeV. The option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to use the proton mass as 938 MeV, leading to:

m =6 *938 =5628 MeV=5.628 GeV.

E=3.5714 *5.628=?

3.5714 *5 =17.857.

3.5714 *0.628= ?

0.6*3.5714=2.1428.

0.028*3.5714≈0.100.

So 2.1428 +0.100=2.2428.

Total E=17.857 +2.2428=20.0998 GeV, approx 20.10 GeV.

Still close to option C's 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus, which is 5.6259 GeV, leading to 20.0925 GeV.

But none of the options match exactly. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recheck.

Wait, beta is 0.96, so beta squared is 0.9216.

1 - beta squared is 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857.

But wait, 0.28^2 is 0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the energy in a different unit. Wait, the options are in GeV, so that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nucleus is being treated as a single particle with mass m =6 * m_p, but that's unlikely since the nucleus has both protons and neutrons.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the atomic mass (including electrons) but that's unlikely because the question refers to the nucleus.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the mass of the Li-6 nucleus as 6 * 938 MeV/c², which gives 5628 MeV or 5.628 GeV.

Then E =3.5714 *5.628 GeV =20.1 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close to 20.1 GeV.

So I think the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy equations. The total energy of the nucleus is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

For \( v = 0.96c \), we find:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

The rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus is calculated as the sum of the masses of its nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons). Using approximate values for the proton and neutron masses (\( m_p \approx 938.272 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), \( m_n \approx 939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)):

\[
m = 3m_p + 3m_n = 3(938.272 + 939.565) = 3(1877.837) = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV}/c^2
\]

Converting to GeV:

\[
m c^2 = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]

The total energy is then:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Performing the multiplication:

\[
E \approx 20.1197 \, \text{GeV}
\]

This value is very close to the given option \( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \). The small discrepancy may arise from rounding or approximations in the mass values. Thus, the closest match is:

**Answer: C**
