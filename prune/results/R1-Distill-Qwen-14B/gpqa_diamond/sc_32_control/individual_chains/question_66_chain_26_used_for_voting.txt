Okay, I'm trying to figure out this SMEFT question. So, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let me think through each symmetry.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where we write down all possible higher-dimensional operators that can modify the Standard Model, respecting certain symmetries. These operators are classified by their dimension and the symmetries they must obey.

Starting with Lorentz symmetry. I think SMEFT operators have to respect Lorentz symmetry because they are part of a Lorentz-invariant theory. The Standard Model is Lorentz-invariant, and SMEFT extends it, so the operators must maintain that symmetry. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely a must.

Next is Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. But wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory. Effective theories usually have Lorentz symmetry but not necessarily the full Poincare because the effective theory applies below a certain scale, and the translations might not be part of the effective description. Or wait, no. Poincare includes translations, which are part of spacetime symmetries. But in an effective theory, you often still have Poincare symmetry because it's a local symmetry. Hmm, maybe SMEFT operators must respect Poincare as well. So 2 could be correct.

Then CP symmetry (3). CP is Charge conjugation and Parity. I'm not entirely sure about this. SMEFT can include operators that break CP, right? Like, the SM has some CP violation, and SMEFT allows for operators that can potentially enhance or modify that. So maybe not all operators have to respect CP symmetry. So 3 might not be a required symmetry.

Lastly, CPT symmetry (4). CPT is the combination of Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. I remember that in quantum field theories, especially those that are Lorentz invariant, CPT symmetry is required. Because the theory must be consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics and relativity. So if the operators respect Lorentz symmetry, they should automatically respect CPT symmetry. So 4 must be a required symmetry.

Wait, let me make sure. So SMEFT operators must be Lorentz scalars, right? Because otherwise, the theory wouldn't be Lorentz-invariant. So any operator in SMEFT must be a scalar under the Lorentz group. Does that imply anything about CPT?

I think in a Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry is automatically respected because of the way the operators are constructed. Or does that depend on the theory? Hmm, maybe not automatically. Wait, let's think. The CPT theorem states that in a Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, CPT symmetry holds. So if the SMEFT operators are part of a Lorentz-invariant theory, then they must respect CPT. So 4 is a must.

So putting it together, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but I thought about whether Poincare is necessary. Because Poincare includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. Are the SMEFT operators required to respect translations?

Wait, translations are part of the Poincare group. So in the SMEFT, the operators are built into the Lagrangian, which must be translation-invariant. So the Lagrangian must be a scalar density, which is Lorentz-invariant and translation-invariant. So the operators (which are part of the Lagrangian terms) must be Lorentz scalars and also have the right scaling under spacetime translations, i.e., they must have a certain mass dimension to make the action dimensionless. But does that imply that the operators must respect Poincare symmetry? Or is it that the Lagrangian is constructed to be Poincare-invariant because of the way the terms are written.

I think the SMEFT operators are constructed such that the entire Lagrangian is Poincare-invariant. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar and a scalar under translations as well. So Poincare symmetry (2) is also a must.

Wait, but in the SMEFT, the operators are added as higher-dimensional terms. So for example, the operator O = (1/Lambda) (some Lorentz scalar). The 1/Lambda makes it dimension 5, so when you multiply by the appropriate fields. But the point is, each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, ensuring that the theory remains Lorentz-invariant. So Poincare symmetry would include translations, and I think the operators are constructed to preserve that.

So now, the conclusion is that all operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4) symmetries. But wait, earlier I thought that CP is not necessarily required, so option 3 is not a must.

So looking at the options:

Option C: 1,2,4 (which are Lorentz, Poincare, CPT)
Option A: 1,2
Option D: 1,3,4 (so Lorentz, CP, CPT)
Option B: 3,4 (CP and CPT)

Wait, but Poincare and Lorentz are connected. Because Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So if the operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. But the question is which must be respected. So the correct set includes Lorentz, and since they must also respect translations, Poincare is included.

Wait, but the question says "must be respected by all operators". Does each operator have to be individually symmetric under Poincare, or is it that the entire theory is symmetric? Because each operator is a term in the Lagrangian, which must be Poincare-invariant. So each operator must transform in a way that, when multiplied by the coupling, their sum gives a Poincare-invariant Lagrangian.

But each individual operator must be a Poincare scalar. Since Poincare includes Lorentz and translations, each operator is both a Lorentz scalar and a translation scalar (i.e., a scalar density). So yes, each operator must be a Poincare scalar.

So the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the correct option is C, which lists 1,2,4.

But wait, another angle: in the SMEFT, the operators are written as Lorentz scalars, but do they have to be Poincare scalars? Because SMEFT is an effective theory valid below the cutoff scale. So the effective theory incorporates all possible interactions consistent with the symmetries of the original theory (Standard Model) up to higher dimensions. The original Standard Model is Poincare-invariant, so the effective theory must also be. Therefore, all operators must respect Poincare. So 1 and 2 are both needed.

Another point: the Poincare algebra includes the generators of Lorentz transformations and translations. So if the operators don't respect Poincare, the theory as a whole might not be Poincare-invariant. So the operators must each be Poincare scalars.

So the symmetries that must be respected by each operator are Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Wait, but I thought that Poincare includes Lorentz, so if an operator is a Poincare scalar, it's automatically a Lorentz scalar. So in that case, the symmetries that must be respected are Poincare and CPT. But the question lists Lorentz as a separate option.

Wait, but the options are 1 and 2. If 2 (Poincare) is a must, then 1 (Lorentz) is automatically a must as part of Poincare. So in that case, the answer would include 2, which implies 1. So which is more correct: including both or just 2?

Hmm, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if each operator must be a Poincare scalar, then Poincare symmetry (2) must be respected, which includes Lorentz. So the answer would include 2, which already includes 1. But the options are given as separate choices. So the correct answer would include 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, but another thought: the Poincare symmetry is a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz and translations. So if the operators have to respect Poincare, then they must respect both Lorentz and translations. So the answer would include 1 (Lorentz) and 2 (Poincare) as separate symmetries that must be respected. But wait, that can't be, since Poincare includes Lorentz.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is that the question is about which symmetries must be individually respected. But if an operator is Poincare invariant, then it's automatically Lorentz invariant as well. So the list of symmetries that must be respected by all operators includes Poincare (which includes Lorentz), CPT, but not necessarily CP.

Wait, but the options don't have 2 and 4 as an option. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) 1,2
B)3,4
C)1,2,4
D)1,3,4

So option C is 1,2,4. Which is Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. But does Poincare include Lorentz? If so, then why would both 1 and 2 be included? Because in reality, Poincare implies Lorentz. So perhaps the correct required symmetries are 1,2,4, but that seems a bit redundant.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that all operators must be Lorentz scalars, but not necessarily respecting Poincare symmetry? Wait, but the effective theory must be Poincare-invariant, so the operators must be such that the entire Lagrangian is Poincare-invariant. So each operator must be a Poincare scalar, so 2 must be respected.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think again.

So the SMEFT is an effective theory, which must respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model. The Standard Model respects Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT symmetries. It does not respect CP symmetry in general (since it has CP violation in the CKM matrix). So the SMEFT operators must respect the same symmetries as the SM. So the operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4) symmetries. But since Poincare includes Lorentz, maybe the question's options are structured such that 1 and 2 are both correct.

Wait, but how can both 1 and 2 be correct if 2 includes 1? Because the question lists them as separate options, perhaps the intended answer is that both Lorentz and Poincare are required. But I'm not sure if SMEFT operators are required to respect both, or just Poincare.

Alternatively, perhaps in the SMEFT, operators are written as Lorentz scalars, but not necessarily Poincare scalars. But that can't be, because the effective theory must be Lorentz-invariant and also translation-invariant.

Wait, no, because the effective theory is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so operators must be Lorentz scalars. But do they need to be Poincare scalars? Because the operators are part of the Lagrangian, and the Lagrangian must be a scalar density (so that when you integrate over spacetime, the action is a number). So each operator must be a scalar density, which is a Poincare scalar. Thus, the operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries.

Wait, but scalar densities are Poincare scalars because under Lorentz transformations they transform as scalars, and under translations they are invariant (since they are density). So the operator must be a scalar density, meaning they transform appropriately under Poincare (Lorentz + translations).

Therefore, the operators must respect Poincare (2) which includes Lorentz (1). So the symmetries that must be respected are 2 (Poincare) and 4 (CPT). But that can't be right because 2 includes 1, so the correct answer would include 2 and 4. But looking at the options, that's not an option. The options are combinations including 1 and 2, etc.

Wait, perhaps in the SMEFT, the operators are constructed as Lorentz scalars, so they must respect Lorentz symmetry, but not necessarily full Poincare? But that doesn't make sense because the Lagrangian must be Poincare-invariant. So each term in the Lagrangian must be a Poincare scalar.

Thus, the correct symmetries that must be respected by all operators are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the correct option would be C, which is 1,2,4.

Wait, but do the operators have to respect CPT?

CPT symmetry is a combination of C, P, and T. In a Lorentz-invariant theory, the CPT theorem states that if the theory is Lorentz-invariant and has a Hermitian Hamiltonian, then it must be CPT-symmetric. So if the SMEFT operators respect Lorentz (1), then they must also respect CPT (4) as a result.

So, to recap:

- Lorentz (1): Must be respected because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory.

- Poincare (2): Since the Lagrangian is a scalar density, yes, operators must respect Poincare.

- CPT (4): Must be respected because the theory is Lorentz-invariant.

- CP (3): Not necessarily respected because SMEFT can include operators that break CP.

So the correct answer includes 1, 2, and 4. Looking at the options, that's option C.

In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), operators must respect certain symmetries to ensure the theory remains consistent with the Standard Model and the principles of quantum field theory. Let us analyze the symmetries in question:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, as it extends the Standard Model, which itself is Lorentz-invariant. All operators in SMEFT must therefore respect Lorentz symmetry. This is a fundamental requirement.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since SMEFT is an effective field theory, the Lagrangian must be a scalar density, ensuring that the theory respects Poincaré symmetry. This implies that all operators must also respect Poincaré symmetry, as they are part of the Lagrangian.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). However, SMEFT allows for operators that can break CP symmetry, as CP violation is already present in the Standard Model. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry combines charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). In Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories, the CPT theorem ensures that CPT symmetry must be respected. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, all operators must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily required.
