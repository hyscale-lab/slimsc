Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about a series of reactions and determining the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, symmetry groups... I remember that's part of molecular geometry, so I need to figure out what E is first.

Let me go through the reactions step by step. The first reaction says solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. The second reaction is C reacting with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Then, C reacts with water to reform A plus two acids F and G. Oh, and F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid. Finally, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

I think I need to identify the compounds involved here. Let's start by looking at the reactions and the products.

First reaction: A + 8 B → C (bright red). I recall that when metals react with certain gases, they form compounds. For example, maybe a metal reacting with chlorine gas? Or perhaps something else.

Wait, bright red product C. That makes me think of sulfur trioxide (SO3) isn't bright red, but maybe another compound. Oh! What about lead? Lead(II,IV) oxide is bright red. But wait, another possibility: maybe sulfur dioxide isn't bright red. Wait, no, SO3 is a colorless gas, I think. Alternatively, maybe it's a metal reacting with a halogen. Like, for example, copper reacts with fluorine to form CuF2, but I'm not sure about the color.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the products when C reacts with water. When C reacts with water, it forms A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, if C plus water gives two acids, perhaps the reaction is something like:

C + H2O → A + F + G

If F is strong and G is weak, maybe F is HCl (strong) and G is something like H2SO3 (which is weak, but wait, H2SO3 is actually a moderately strong acid, but perhaps in this case, it's a weaker one compared to HCl). Alternatively, maybe F is H2SO4 (but that's a strong acid), but wait, no, sulfuric acid is strong but maybe another scenario.

Wait, another approach: when C reacts with water, it produces two acids. So perhaps C is a compound that when hydrolyzed, gives two different acids. For example, consider something like Na2SO3, which when it reacts with water might not directly give two acids, but maybe a different compound.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite or a sulfate. Wait, but let's think about the first reaction again: A reacting with B in a 8:1 ratio. If B is a diatomic gas, then 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles per mole of A. So, for example, if B is O2, then 8 O2 would mean something like a reaction forming an oxide with a high oxidation state.

Wait, but O2 is diatomic, so 8 equivalents would give 16 O atoms per A. For example, if A is sulfur (S), reacting with O2 would form SO4^2- (sulfate). Wait, but that's more about the ions. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms an oxide with B as oxygen.

Wait, maybe A is sulfur. Let's see: S (solid) reacting with O2 (gas) to form SO3 (which is a liquid or gas, but I'm not sure if it's bright red). Alternatively, if A is carbon, reacting with O2 would form CO2, which is a gas but not red.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is SO3. Because SO3 is a gas, colorless, but in some forms, maybe it's not. Alternatively, perhaps it's another compound. Wait, bright red makes me think of lead dioxide, PbO2, which is bright red. But I'm not sure about the reaction steps.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate, but nitrates are usually colorless or white. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the second reaction: C + 2 D → E, which is extremely hazardous. So D must be a reactive gas. Also, when D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents like H2O, but wait, H is a product of D and B. If B is O2, and D is something like H2 (but H2 and O2 reacting would form H2O, which is a solvent. So H is H2O in that case.

Wait, but D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio. If B is O2, then D could be something that reacts with O2 in a 1:1 ratio. Like H2, which would form H2O. So D is H2. So, that would make H as H2O, which is a solvent. That seems plausible.

So, D is H2 (gas). Then, the second reaction is C + 2 H2 → E. So, reacting C with hydrogen gas, perhaps a reduction reaction.

If C is SO3, then reacting with H2 would produce S and H2O? Or maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, if C is a sulfite, like SO2, but SO2 reacting with H2 would not make sense. Or perhaps C is a higher oxide.

Wait, if C is SO3, reacting with H2 could be something like:

SO3 + H2 → ?

Wait, but that doesn't immediately make sense. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitric oxide or something else.

Wait, let's go back. C reacting with water gives A, F, and G. If F is a strong acid and G a weak one, perhaps we're looking at a situation where C is a sulfite or a sulfate.

Wait, if C is Na2SO3, then when it reacts with water, it would hydrolyze into 2NaOH (strong base, not acid) and H2SO3, which is a weak acid. Hmm, but that would produce a base and an acid. But the question says two acids, F and G. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, if C is something like H2SO4, but when it reacts with water, it just remains as H2SO4, which is a strong acid itself, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something like SO3^2- (sulfite), which when reacted with water gives H2SO3, a weak acid. But that's only one acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed anhydride or something that when hydrolyzed produces two different acids. For example, maybe something like a nitrate and another acid.

Wait, another approach: if C is a nitrate, say NaNO3, when it reacts with water, perhaps it doesn't decompose, but that doesn't explain two acids. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a metal sulfite. Let's say A is Mg, and B is O2. Mg reacts with O2 to form MgO, but that's a 1:1 ratio, not 8:1. So that might not fit.

Wait, maybe A is sulfur (S), and B is Cl2 (chlorine gas). 8 equivalents of Cl2 would mean 8 moles per mole of S. So, S + 8 Cl2 → S8Cl16? No, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is a metal, B is Cl2, and C is a metal chloride. For example, iron reacts with chlorine gas to form FeCl3. But would that fit the 8 equivalents? Let me see: Fe (atomic weight ~56 g/mol) reacting with Cl2 (molecular weight ~71 g/mol), but I'm not sure how the stoichiometry works.

Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur (S) and B is oxygen (O2). The reaction S + O2 → SO2 or SO3. But the stoichiometry would vary. For example, S + O2 → SO3 would require 3 moles of O2 per mole of S. But the question says 8 equivalents. Hmm, that's 8 O2 per S? So perhaps S + 8 O2 → something. Wait, S has a valency of +4 or +6. So 8 O2 would be 16 O atoms. So maybe S in a +16 oxidation state? That's unlikely. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, perhaps the product C is SO3, which is a trigonal pyramidal molecule. But then when it reacts with H2 (if D is H2), maybe it reduces to S and H2O. But then E would be S. But that doesn't seem extremely hazardous.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitro compound. Like, C could be a nitrate ester or something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle. The second reaction is C + 2 D → E. If D is H2, then E is the result of C reacting with hydrogen. That could be a reduction. So if C is a nitrate, E could be an amine or something else. Alternatively, if C is a sulfite, perhaps it's reduced to S.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me see if I can think of E. The question is about its molecular symmetry group. So E must be a molecule with a certain symmetry.

The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Wait, what are these symmetry groups?

C2: has a 2-fold rotation axis. For example, H2O2 has C2 symmetry.

D4h: has a four-fold rotation axis, a horizontal mirror plane, and other elements. For example, ozone (O3) has D3h symmetry, but I'm not sure about others.

D∞h: this is the symmetry group for a linear molecule with an infinite number of symmetry operations, like CO2 (which is D∞h). But wait, CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry.

C2v: has a 2-fold rotation axis and vertical mirror planes. For example, SO2 has C2v symmetry.

Wait, wait. If E is a linear molecule, its symmetry group might be D∞h. Or if it's something like O3, it's D3h.

But to figure out what E is, I need to know what the reactions produce.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas. So, what are some extremely hazardous products? Maybe something like hydrogen cyanide (HCN), but I don't know what its symmetry is. Or phosgene (COCl2), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if C is SO3, and D is H2, then E could be H2S (but I don't think that's right because SO3 and H2 would probably not react to form H2S. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more complicated.

Wait, if C is SO3 and D is H2, maybe the reaction is SO3 + H2 → H2SO4? But then the stoichiometry would require more H2. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reduction.

Wait, another possibility: C is NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), which is a bright red-brown gas. Oh wait, that's a possibility. So if A reacts with B to form NO2, which is bright red. Let me see.

So first reaction: A + 8 B → C (NO2). Then, NO2 reacts with D (which is H2) in a 2:1 ratio to form E. So NO2 + 2 H2 → ?

What's the reaction between NO2 and H2? Maybe it forms HNO2 (nitrous acid) or something else. Or perhaps it reduces to N2 and water.

Wait, the reaction might be: 4 NO2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O + 2 N2O (but I'm not sure). Alternatively, perhaps it's 4 NO2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O + 2 N2O. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's a reduction to form NH3, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: NO2 is C, which reacts with H2 (D) in 2 equivalents to form E. Let me think about the possible product. NO2 is a strong oxidizing agent. Maybe it reacts with hydrogen to form HNO3 (nitric acid) and water. But then the reaction would be something like: 4 NO2 + 2 H2O → 4 HNO3 + 2 H2. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because H2 is a reactant.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is 4 NO2 + 2 H2 → 4 HNO + H2O? No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where NO2 is reduced to NH3. Let me think: 6 NO2 + 4 H2 → 6 NH3 + 4 H2O? Not sure.

Alternatively, if E is N2O, which has a structure similar to H2O, but with a different symmetry. Wait, N2O has a trigonal planar structure, I think. Or maybe it's linear, but that's more like CO2.

Wait, another angle: when C (NO2) reacts with water to form A, F, and G. Let's say NO2 + H2O → HNO3 (strong acid) and NO (weak acid? Wait, NO is a gas, not an acid. Hmm, maybe I'm off track here.

Wait, perhaps C is a different compound. Let's think of another possibility. Maybe C is a metal oxide.

Wait, if A is a metal, say lead, and B is oxygen, then the reaction could form PbO2, which is bright red. So, 2 Pb + 8 O2 → 2 PbO2? That would fit the 8 equivalents (since Pb has a valency of +2, so each Pb needs 4 O atoms, but 8 O2 would be 16 O atoms, so 2 Pb would need 16 O, which would form 2 PbO2. That makes sense.

So perhaps C is PbO2. Then, when C reacts with D (H2), what happens? PbO2 + H2 → ?

I think PbO2 can react with H2 in acidic conditions to produce Pb^2+ and water. Maybe the reaction is PbO2 + H2 → Pb + 2 H2O. But that would be a reduction, as PbO2 is a strong oxidizing agent.

So E would be Pb. Lead. But wait, Pb is a solid, not a gas. The question says E is extremely hazardous. Lead is toxic, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps E is Hg or another heavy metal, but I'm not certain.

But let's go back to the initial reaction where C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. If C is PbO2, and when it reacts with water, it might hydrolyze. But PbO2 is not very soluble in water. However, perhaps in acidic conditions, it can form Pb^2+ and O2. Wait, but in the reaction, it's just water. So maybe the hydrolysis of PbO2 would produce PbO and O2, but that doesn't fit the description of forming two acids.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track with C being PbO2.

Another thought: maybe C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it would hydrolyze into 2 Na+ and HSO3^- (which can further dissociate into H+ and SO3^2-, but that's not producing two acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is a different sulfite.

Wait, perhaps C is Na2CO3? No, that's a carbonate, which when hydrolyzed gives HCO3^- and OH^-, not acids.

Alternatively, maybe C is something like (NH4)2SO3. When it hydrolyzes, it would produce NH4OH (a weak acid) and H2SO3 (which is a weak acid as well). But in the problem, F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So maybe F is H2SO4 (strong) and G is H2SO3 (weak), but that would require C being a sulfate, not a sulfite.

Wait, if C is (NH4)2SO4, then when it reacts with water, it would dissociate into 2 NH4^+ and SO4^2-, but that doesn't give two acids. Unless the NH4+ hydrolyzes into NH3 and H+. Hmm, maybe that's a possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed salt, like NH4HSO4. When it reacts with water, it could dissociate into NH4^+ (which hydrolyzes into NH3 and H+) and HSO4^- (which is a weak acid).

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the second reaction again. C reacts with D (H2) to form E. If E is a highly hazardous product, and the reaction is a reduction, perhaps E is HCN (hydrogen cyanide), but I don't know what reaction would produce that.

Alternatively, perhaps E is NH3, but that's not extremely hazardous. Wait, maybe E is Cl2, but that's the starting material.

Wait, another angle: If D is H2, then E is a product of C and H2. Let's think of C as SO3. Then SO3 + H2 might produce H2SO4 and H2O? But the stoichiometry would matter. The reaction could be:

SO3 + H2 → H2SO4 (but that doesn't balance; actually, the formation of H2SO4 from SO3 and H2O, not H2. So maybe that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitro compound. Wait, maybe C is N2O5, dinitrogen pentoxide. It's a strong oxidizing agent and reacts with H2 to form HNO3 and H2O. Let's check the reaction: N2O5 + H2 → 2 HNO3 + H2O? But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Wait, the reaction given is C + 2 D → E. So if C is N2O5 and D is H2, the stoichiometry would be N2O5 + H2 → 2 HNO3 + H2O? But that would require more H2. Alternatively, perhaps it's 2 N2O5 + 4 H2 → 4 HNO3 + 4 H2O. Hmm, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is N2O5 + H2 → 2 HNO2 + H2O. But I'm not sure.

But if E is HNO3, which is a strong acid, then the symmetry group of HNO3 would be C2v because the molecule has a central N, with two O's on either side and one O in the middle. Wait, no, HNO3 structure is O=N(OH)O. Wait, no, the structure of HNO3 is O=N(OH)O. Wait, no, HNO3 is H-O-NO2. So the molecule is trigonal planar around the central nitrogen. Wait, no, the structure is more like:

H
|
O
|
N
/ \
O   O

Which makes it a trigonal planar geometry, but the molecule is bent. So the symmetry group would be C2v. Because it has a mirror plane through the N-O and H-O, and a C2 axis perpendicular to the plane.

Wait, but HNO3 has a trigonal planar structure, which is symmetric with a C3 axis, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something with a linear structure. For example, CO2 has D∞h symmetry. But then, would CO2 be formed from C and H2? Not sure.

Wait, another possibility: E is SO2, which has D∞h symmetry. But how would that form? If C is something that when reacted with H2 gives SO2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Let me think about the options again. The question asks for the molecular symmetry group of E.

The options are:

A) C2
B) D4h
C) D∞h
D) C2v

If E is a linear molecule, its symmetry group is likely D∞h, like CO2. If E is a trigonal planar molecule, like SO2, then its symmetry group is D3h, which isn't one of the options. Alternatively, if E is a bent molecule, like H2O, which has C2v symmetry.

Wait, but if E is H2O, which has C2v symmetry, then that would be option D. But does E make sense as H2O in the context?

Alternatively, if E is O3, which has D3h symmetry, but that's not an option here.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider each reaction again.

Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red). Let's suppose B is O2. So 8 moles of O2 per mole of A. A could be S, reacting to form SO3. S is solid, O2 is gas. SO3 is a liquid or gas, but I'm not sure about the color. Alternatively, if A is Fe, Fe + O2 → Fe3O4, but that doesn't fit 8 equivalents.

Wait, maybe A is S, and B is O2. The reaction S + O2 → SO3. The stoichiometry is S + 3 O2 → 2 SO3. Wait, that's 3 equivalents of O2 per S. But the question says 8 equivalents. So perhaps 8 O2 per S. That would be S + 8 O2 → 4 SO3? No, because each SO3 needs 3 O2 per S. Hmm, maybe it's a typo, but perhaps the first reaction is a different one.

Alternatively, maybe B is not O2 but Cl2. Let's see: A reacts with 8 Cl2 → C. If A is S, then S + 4 Cl2 → 4 SCl2. But that's 4 equivalents, not 8. Alternatively, S + 8 Cl2 → 8 SCl?

Wait, no, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state chloride. For example, lead (Pb) reacting with Cl2 to form PbCl4. The reaction would be Pb + 2 Cl2 → PbCl4. But that's 2 equivalents of Cl2. Not 8.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the reaction C + 2 D → E, where D is H2. So E is formed from C and H2.

If E is H2S, which is a weak acid, but I'm not sure about its symmetry. H2S has a bent structure with C2v symmetry. So its symmetry group would be C2v (option D). But is E extremely hazardous? H2S is toxic, but maybe not as extremely hazardous as some other compounds.

Alternatively, E could be NH3, but that's not extremely hazardous. Alternatively, maybe E is CO, which is a gas but not extremely hazardous in small amounts, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: If C is SO3 and D is H2, perhaps the reaction produces H2S. But I don't see a direct reaction path for that. Alternatively, maybe it's a reduction of sulfates to sulfides, but that would likely require more H2.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitro compound. Let's say C is HNO3, but that's not bright red. Alternatively, C is HNO2, which is a yellowish liquid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide that is bright red. Lead dioxide (PbO2) is bright red. So reaction 1: A + 8 B → PbO2. So A could be Pb, and B could be O2. The reaction would be 2 Pb + 8 O2 → 2 PbO2. That would fit the 8 equivalents (since each Pb requires 4 O2, so 2 Pb would need 8 O2). So C is PbO2.

Then, when C reacts with D (H2), the reaction would be PbO2 + H2 → Pb + 2 H2O. So E would be Pb, which is a solid. But the problem says E is a product, but doesn't specify its state. However, the question is about its molecular symmetry group, which implies it's a molecule. So perhaps E is a compound, not an elemental solid.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is different. PbO2 reacting with H2 in an acidic solution could produce Pb^2+ and water, but that's more of a dissolution process.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let's try to think about the possible symmetry groups and match them with possible E candidates.

Option C is D∞h, which suggests a linear molecule. So E could be something like CO2, HCN, or SO2.

If E is SO2, which is a bent molecule with D∞h symmetry? Wait, no, SO2 is bent and has C2v symmetry. D∞h is for linear molecules.

Wait, correction: D∞h symmetry is for linear molecules with a center of inversion and other elements. So CO2 is linear and has D∞h. HCN is linear and has D∞h as well.

If E is HCN, which is a linear molecule, then its symmetry group is D∞h (option C). But would HCN fit as a product of PbO2 and H2? I don't think so. PbO2 reacting with H2 would more likely produce Pb and water.

Alternatively, if E is CO2, how would that form from C and H2? I don't see a direct reaction.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with water, it forms A, F, and G. If A is Pb, then F and G are acids. So PbO2 reacting with water would produce what? PbO2 is not very soluble in water, but in strong acids, it can react. Maybe in the presence of H+ ions, PbO2 reacts to form Pb^2+ and O2. But that's more of an electrolysis reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a different compound. Let's think about the possible products when a compound reacts with water to form two acids. For example, sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) reacting with water would produce H2SO3 (a weak acid) and NaOH (a strong base, not acid). That doesn't fit. Alternatively, calcium carbide (CaC2) reacts with water to produce acetylene and calcium hydroxide (a base), which again doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a sulfonamide, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, maybe C is a peroxide, like H2O2. H2O2 reacts with water to produce O2 gas and H2O, but that doesn't fit the description of producing two acids.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of E. If E has D∞h symmetry, which is linear, then possible candidates are CO2, HCN, NO2 (but NO2 is a dimer, so maybe not), or maybe something like O3, but O3 is not linear.

Wait, maybe E is a diatomic molecule. For example, O2 has D∞h symmetry. But O2 is the reactant B, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: if E is a linear molecule like SO2, but I'm not sure about its symmetry group. Wait, SO2 has a bent structure with C2v symmetry, so that would be option D.

Alternatively, if E is H2O, which has C2v symmetry, but that's H2O, which is a solvent (H is H2O in the reaction with D and B). So D and B reacting to form H, which is a solvent, so H is H2O.

Wait, so D (H2) and B (O2) react to form H (H2O). So H is H2O. So B is O2, D is H2.

So, reaction D + B → H: H2 + O2 → H2O.

So, in that case, B is O2, D is H2.

So, first reaction: A + 8 O2 → C (bright red). So A is reacting with O2 to form C, which is bright red.

So, what reacts with O2 to form a bright red product? Sulfur trioxide isn't bright red, but perhaps a metal oxide. Lead dioxide (PbO2) is bright red. So A could be Pb (lead), and C is PbO2.

Then, when PbO2 reacts with H2 (D) in a 2:1 ratio, what happens? The reaction would be:

PbO2 + H2 → Pb + 2 H2O.

So, E is Pb (lead). But Pb is a solid, and the problem says E is a product but doesn't specify the state. However, the molecular symmetry group is about the structure of a molecule; Pb is an elemental solid with a face-centered cubic structure, which doesn't have a molecular symmetry group in the same way as a compound.

Hmm, that's conflicting. So perhaps I'm wrong about C being PbO2.

Another possibility: A is sulfur (S), and B is O2. The reaction S + 8 O2 → 4 SO3. SO3 is a liquid or gas, but I'm not sure about the color. Alternatively, maybe the product is a different oxide.

Wait, another angle: When C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. If A is S, then C reacting with water gives S, F, and G. So, perhaps C is a sulfide or a sulfate.

Wait, if C is Na2SO4 (sodium sulfate), then reacting with water (dilution) wouldn't produce two acids. Alternatively, if C is NaHSO4, then dissolving in water would give H+ (from HSO4^-) and Na+.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonic acid or something else. Alternatively, maybe C is a dimer. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitro compound, like HNO3. When it reacts with water, it just stays as HNO3, which is a strong acid, but again, only one acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed anhydride. For example, something like HSO4^- and SO4^2-.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should focus on the molecular symmetry groups and think about which option is more likely.

The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If E has D∞h symmetry, it must be a linear molecule. So possible candidates are CO2, HCN, NO2 (if it's dimerized), etc.

Wait, another thought: If E is O3, but that's not linear. Ozone is bent, with D3h symmetry.

Wait, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule like O2, but O2 has D∞h symmetry. But O2 is the reactant B, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe E is a linear molecule like CO. CO has D∞h symmetry. But how would that form from C and H2? I don't think so.

Wait, maybe E is NH3, which has a trigonal pyramidal structure (C3v symmetry), but that's not one of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each step again.

Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red). B is O2 (as per earlier reasoning with H2 and O2 forming H2O). So A is a metal that reacts with O2 to form a red oxide. PbO2 is red, so A is Pb.

Reaction 2: C (PbO2) + 2 H2 → E. What's E? Probably Pb and water. But Pb is an element, not a molecule, so symmetry group doesn't apply. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Another possibility: Maybe C is a different oxide. For example, maybe it's MnO2, which is dark brown but not bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's V2O5, which is orange. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: If C is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, which is white, not red. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe C is a different compound altogether.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitro compound. Let's say C is HNO3. When it reacts with H2, perhaps it's reduced to HNO2 or NH3. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but earlier we thought D is H2, and H is H2O. So, the reaction D + B → H is H2 + O2 → H2O.

So, B is O2, D is H2.

So, reaction 1: A + 8 O2 → C (bright red). So, A could be a metal forming a high oxidation state oxide.

Another metal that forms a bright red oxide is chromium in +6 oxidation state, like CrO3. But I'm not sure about the color. Alternatively, maybe it's a manganese compound.

Wait, if A is Cr, then Cr + O2 → CrO3 (chromium trioxide), which is bright red. The reaction would be Cr + 3 O2 → CrO3. But that's 3 equivalents, not 8. Hmm, but perhaps it's a different stoichiometry.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is 4 Cr + 8 O2 → 4 CrO4^2- (chromate ions), but that would require a basic solution. Alternatively, in acidic conditions, it would form dichromate (Cr2O7^2-). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a permanganate, like KMnO4, which is purple. But the color isn't bright red.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck again. Let me try to think about the possible products and their symmetry.

If E has D∞h symmetry, it's a linear molecule. So, possibilities include CO2, HCN, NO2 (if it's a dimer, but NO2 is dimeric, so perhaps not), or even something like CS2, which is a linear molecule.

But how would E be formed from C and H2?

Wait, if C is CO2, which is D∞h, and D is H2, perhaps E is CH4 or something else, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonyl chloride, like COCl2, which has a planar structure but not linear. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.

If C is a sulfonic acid, like RSO3H, but that's likely beyond the current context.

Alternatively, if C is a nitro compound, like HNO3. When it reacts with water, it just dissociates into H+ and NO3^-, not forming two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a peroxide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed salt. For example, (NH4)HSO4. When it reacts with water, it can dissociate into NH4+ and HSO4^-, which can further dissociate into NH3 (a weak acid, but actually a weak base) and H2SO4 (a strong acid). So F could be H2SO4 (strong), and G could be NH4OH (which is a weak acid, though it's more of a weak base as NH3 is basic). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a different compound.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes into 2NaOH (strong base) and H2SO3 (weak acid). But the question says F and G are acids, so that doesn't fit because NaOH is a base.

Hmm, perhaps C is a different sulfite or sulfate.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a metal carbonate that reacts with water to form a metal hydroxide and carbonic acid. But carbonic acid is weak, and the hydroxide would be a base, not an acid.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think about E's symmetry and possible structures.

If E is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, then CO2 is a good candidate. So how would CO2 form from C and H2?

Wait, perhaps C is CO (carbon monoxide), and D is H2. Then, CO + H2 → CH4, but that's a different product. Alternatively, CO + H2O → CH4O, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: Maybe C is a carbonate, but I don't think that's relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a dimer of CO, so C is CO2. Then, when it reacts with H2, perhaps it forms CH4O (which doesn't make sense) or something else.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the information.

From the reactions, D is H2, B is O2, so C is likely a compound formed by A (probably a metal) and O2. The bright red product suggests PbO2. Then, when C (PbO2) reacts with H2, perhaps it produces Pb and H2O, but Pb is an element, not a molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a different oxide. Maybe it's an oxide of sulfur, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is SO3. Then, when C reacts with H2, maybe it reduces to S and H2O. But that would make E as S, which is an element, not a molecule.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the third reaction: C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.

If C is PbO2, reacting with water would produce PbO and O2, but that doesn't fit the two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite. Let's say C is Na2SO3. Then, reacting with water would produce 2 NaOH (strong base) and H2SO3 (weak acid). But the problem says F and G are acids, so that's not right.

Alternatively, C could be H2SO3, but then reacting with water wouldn't change much.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a nitrate ester. For example, if C is HNO3, reacting with water doesn't produce two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a different compound.

Wait, perhaps C is a diacid. Let's say C is H2SO4. Then, reacting with water would just dissociate into 2 H+ and SO4^2-, which again doesn't fit two acids.

Hmm. I'm stuck again. Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

If E has D∞h symmetry, it's a linear molecule. So if E is CO2, then the symmetry group is D∞h. So option C.

Another possibility is if E is HCN, which is linear. So symmetry group D∞h.

But how to connect E being HCN.

Wait, if C is CH3Cl, and D is H2, but that doesn't fit the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrile, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps when C (a nitro compound) reacts with H2, it reduces to an amine. For example, nitrobenzene reduces to aniline. But that's a substitution reaction, not a molecular reaction.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitroso compound.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the information I have, I'll go with E having D∞h symmetry, so the answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the identification of the molecular symmetry group of product E. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.  
   - The bright red color suggests a compound like PbO₂ (lead dioxide) or a high oxidation state oxide.  
   - If A is lead (Pb) and B is oxygen (O₂), the reaction could be:  
     \[
     2 \, \text{Pb} + 8 \, \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \, \text{PbO}_2
     \]  
     This fits the stoichiometry and produces a bright red product.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product.  
   - Gas D is identified as H₂ (hydrogen) based on the reaction with B (O₂) to form H₂O (solvent).  
   - The reaction between PbO₂ and H₂ could involve reduction:  
     \[
     \text{PbO}_2 + 2 \, \text{H}_2 \rightarrow \text{Pb} + 2 \, \text{H}_2\text{O}
     \]  
     However, Pb is an elemental solid, not a molecule, so this does not align with the molecular symmetry requirement for E.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak).  
   - If C is PbO₂, it does not dissolve in water to produce acids, so this suggests C might be a different compound.  
   - Another possibility is that C is a sulfite or sulfate, but these do not align with the bright red color or the production of two acids.

4. **Symmetry Group of E**:  
   - The options are:  
     A) C₂  
     B) D₄h  
     C) D∞h  
     D) C₂v  
   - D∞h symmetry corresponds to linear molecules like CO₂, HCN, or SO₂.  
   - Among these, CO₂ is a plausible candidate for E, as it is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. However, the reactions do not directly support the formation of CO₂.  
   - Given the constraints and the symmetry options, the most consistent answer is that E has D∞h symmetry.

**Answer: C**
