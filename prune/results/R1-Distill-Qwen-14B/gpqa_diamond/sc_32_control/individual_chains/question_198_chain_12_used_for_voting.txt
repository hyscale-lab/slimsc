Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember stability constants (β) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So the question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in the solution.

Let me read the problem again. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and SCN- is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that's a bit confusing because β usually increases with the number of ligands, but here β4 is lower than β3. Maybe the complexes have different structures or some other factors? But I'll proceed with the given data.

The blue dithiocyanato complex is probably the one with two SCN- ligands. So I'm looking for the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^n+ (where n is the charge, but I think the exact charge might not matter for the ratio).

I remember that the distribution of metal complexes can be determined using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand. The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex form based on their stability constants and the ligand concentration.

The formula I think is something like the fraction for each complex is (β^k * L^k) / (1 + β1*L + β1β2*L^2 + ... + β1β2...βn*L^n). Or wait, maybe more accurately, each species' concentration is determined by the product of the previous β and the ligand. Let me think about the formation steps.

The formation of the complexes occurs stepwise. So the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^+, then [Co(SCN)_2]^something, and so on up to four SCN- ligands. Each step has its own stability constant.

The general approach is to model the distribution of the different complexes. Let me outline the possible complexes:

Co²+ can form [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^?, [Co(SCN)_3]^??, and [Co(SCN)_4]^{??}. Each step's stability constant is given as β1=9 (probably for the first ligand), β2=40 (second), β3=63 (third), and β4=16 (fourth). Wait, that's a bit odd because β4 is lower than β3. Maybe the fourth ligand is less stable? Or perhaps the complexes have different structures, like some being fac versus mer or something, but I think for this problem, we treat them as sequential with given βs.

The problem is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is the one with two ligands.

Wait, but the way β works is that βn is the overall stability constant for the nth complex. So β1 is the constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+? Or maybe each β is the stepwise constant for adding one ligand. Like, β1 is the formation of [CoSCN]^+ from Co²+ and SCN-, β2 is the formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ from [CoSCN]^+ and SCN-, and so on.

So the total concentration of all Co species is c_total = [Co²+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^+ + [Co(SCN)_3]^+ + [Co(SCN)_4]^+.

Wait, but the charges would vary. Let me not get stuck on the charge because the problem is about the concentration fractions.

The approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex. Let me denote the free [SCN-] as L. The concentrations of each complex can be expressed in terms of the stepwise β's and L.

Let me define:

- Let’s denote [Co²+] as C.

Then:

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 * C * L

[Co(SCN)_2]^? = β2 * [CoSCN]^+ * L = β2 * β1 * C * L²

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3]^?? = β3 * [Co(SCN)_2]^? * L = β3 * β2 * β1 * C * L^3

[Co(SCN)_4]^??? = β4 * [Co(SCN)_3]^?? * L = β4 * β3 * β2 * β1 * C * L^4

Then, the total concentration of Co is:

C_total = C + β1 C L + β1 β2 C L^2 + β1 β2 β3 C L^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 C L^4

Factoring out C:

C_total = C [ 1 + β1 L + β1 β2 L^2 + β1 β2 β3 L^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 L^4 ]

But C is the concentration of free Co²+.

Wait, but in this case, the total Co concentration is given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M. So:

C_total = c(Co) = 1e-2 M = [Co²+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^+ + ... etc.

So,

1e-2 = C [ 1 + β1 L + β1 β2 L^2 + β1 β2 β3 L^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 L^4 ]

Let me compute each term step by step.

Given:
β1 = 9
β2 = 40
β3 = 63
β4 = 16

L = [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

Compute each term:

Term0: 1
Term1: β1 L = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9
Term2: β1 β2 L^2 = 9 * 40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6
Term3: β1 β2 β3 L^3 = 9 *40 *63 * (0.1)^3 = 9*40=360; 360 *63=22680; 22680 * 0.001=22.68
Term4: β1 β2 β3 β4 L^4 =9 *40 *63 *16 * (0.1)^4. Let's compute:

9 *40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880. Then multiply by (0.1)^4=1e-4. So 362880 *1e-4 = 36.288.

Wait wait, wait. Wait, I think I might have messed up β4's position. Because, the order is β1, β2, β3, β4. So the term4 is β1 * β2 * β3 * β4 * L^4.

Wait, but in the expression, Term4 is β1 β2 β3 β4 L^4. So that's correct.

Wait, let me recompute each term:

Compute each step:

Term0 = 1

Term1 = beta1 * L = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term2 = beta1 * beta2 * L^2 =9*40=360; 360*(0.1)^2=360*0.01=3.6

Term3 = beta1 * beta2 * beta3 * L^3 =9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*(0.1)^3=22680*0.001=22.68

Term4 = beta1 * beta2 * beta3 * beta4 * L^4 =9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880; 362880*(0.1)^4=362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

Wait that's a lot. So the sum is:

Sum = 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 + 36.288 = let's compute each step.

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So Sum =64.468.

Then,

1e-2 = C * 64.468 → C= 1e-2 /64.468 ≈ 0.00015518 M.

But I'm not directly looking for C. I need the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^something.

The concentration of the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^? = beta1 * beta2 * C * L^2.

Which is 9 *40 * C * (0.1)^2.

So:

9 *40 = 360.

(0.1)^2 =0.01.

So [Co(SCN)_2] = 360 * C * 0.01 = 3.6 * C.

But C is 1e-2 /64.468 ≈0.00015518.

So 3.6 * 0.00015518 ≈ 0.00055865 M.

But the total Co concentration is 1e-2 M, so the fraction is [Co(SCN)_2]/(1e-2) * 100%.

Wait, but wait: the fraction is ( [Co(SCN)_2] ) / (total Co) ) * 100.

Because the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all Co species.

So [Co(SCN)_2] =3.6 * C =3.6*(1e-2 /64.468) ≈ (3.6 * 1e-2) /64.468.

Compute that:

3.6e-2 =0.0036.

0.0036 /64.468 ≈0.00005576.

Wait, but that seems too small. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, no: [Co(SCN)_2] is beta1 * beta2 * C * L^2.

Beta1=9, beta2=40: 9*40=360.

L^2 =0.1^2=0.01.

So beta1 * beta2 * L^2 =360 *0.01=3.6.

Thus [Co(SCN)_2] =3.6 * C.

C= (1e-2) /64.468 ≈0.00015518 M.

So 3.6 * 0.00015518 ≈0.00055865 M.

Wait, but then the fraction is [Co(SCN)_2]/(1e-2) = 0.00055865 /0.01 =0.055865.

So 5.5865%? But that's not one of the options. The options are about 16-42%. So I must have done something wrong.

Wait, maybe I messed up the way the fractions are calculated. Because sometimes, people use the formation constants in a different way. Or perhaps the way the βs are used is cumulative.

Wait, another approach is to calculate the fraction of each species, then sum them up.

The fraction f_k for each complex is (β1 β2 ...βk L^k) / (1 + β1 L + β1 β2 L^2 + ... + product up to β4 L^4 )

So for k=2 (dithiocyanate), f_2 = (β1 * beta2 * L^2) / sum_terms.

sum_terms is 64.468 as before.

So f_2 = (9 *40 * (0.1)^2 ) / 64.468.

Compute numerator: 9*40=360, 360*(0.01)=3.6.

So f_2=3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05573, or 5.573%. But that's still not in the options. So something's wrong.

Wait, the options are higher: A is 42%, C is ~38%, etc. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I swapped the βs. Wait, the problem says β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, perhaps the order is different. Maybe β1 is the first complex, β2 the second, etc., but perhaps the stepwise β is different. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the βs are for the overall complex, not stepwise. Like, β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, etc. Wait, no, that wouldn't make sense. The stepwise constants are usually multiplied for the total.

Wait, perhaps the βs are given as the overall stability constants for each complex. So [Co(SCN)]^+ has β1=9, [Co(SCN)_2]^something has β2=40, and so on. Then, the fraction for each complex is (β^k * L^k) / (sum of all terms).

Wait, that could be a different approach. Let's try that.

In this case, for each complex:

[Co] = C

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 * C * L

[Co(SCN)_2]^? = β2 * C * L^2

[Co(SCN)_3]^?? = β3 * C * L^3

[Co(SCN)_4]^??? = β4 * C * L^4

Wait, but that can't be right because the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2] would be β1 * β2. Hmm, no, that's not the same as the approach before.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that each β is the cumulative stability constant for the complex with n ligands. So β1 is the constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^3+, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^4+.

If that's the case, then the fraction for each complex is (βk * L^k) / (sum of all βk L^k +1 )

Wait, but that can't be right because you have to account for the stepwise additions.

This is getting confusing. Maybe I should refer to a standard approach for such problems.

Wait, the standard approach is to calculate the fraction of each species using the stepwise formation constants.

The fraction f_k for each species with k ligands is ( β1 β2 ... βk L^k ) / ( sum_{i=0}^n ( β1 β2 ... βi L^i ) )

In this problem, n=4.

So, for each k from 0 to4, compute the numerator as product β1...βk multiplied by L^k, and sum them all.

Wait, but in the initial approach, the denominator was sum_terms = 1 + beta1 L + beta1 beta2 L^2 + beta1 beta2 beta3 L^3 + ... etc.

Which is what I did earlier.

So, the fraction of the dithiocyanate complex (k=2) is (beta1 beta2 L^2) / sum_terms.

Sum_terms is 64.468 as calculated before.

So f_2 =3.6 /64.468 ≈0.0557, which is about 5.57%—but none of the options are that low.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of sum_terms.

Wait, let me recalculate sum_terms term by term. Maybe I messed up the multiplication somewhere.

Term0:1

Term1:9 *0.1=0.9 → 1+0.9=1.9

Term2:9*40*(0.1)^2 → 9 *40=360; 360 *0.01=3.6 →1.9 +3.6=5.5

Term3:9*40 *63 * (0.1)^3 →9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *0.001=22.68 →5.5 +22.68=28.18

Term4:9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4 →9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880; 362880 *0.0001=36.288 →28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So sum_terms=64.468. Correct.

Hmm. So then f_2=3.6 /64.468 ≈0.0557, 5.57%—but the options are way higher.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the βs. What if the βs are for the overall complexes, not stepwise?

Wait, for example, β1 is the overall stability constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^3+, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^4+.

In that case, the fraction for each complex would be (βk * [SCN-]^k ) / ( sum (βk [SCN-]^k ) + 1 )

But wait, that seems different from the stepwise approach.

Wait, let's think again. If β1 is the overall constant for [CoSCN]^+, then:

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 * [Co][SCN-]

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ = β2 * [Co][SCN-]^2.

But wait, that can't be right because each ligand addition would have its own stepwise constant.

Alternatively, perhaps the βs are for each complex in a way that the fraction for [Co(SCN)_k] is (βk * L^k ) / (sum βi L^i +1 ), but that's not the standard approach.

Alternatively, maybe the βs are given as the cumulative stability constants.

Cumulative β for [CoSCN]^+ is β1=9.

Cumulative β for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is β2=40, which would be β1 * β2_step =9 * β2_step =40 → β2_step=40/9 ≈4.444.

Wait, but that complicates it more. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I have to calculate the conditional formation constants, considering the ligand concentration.

Wait, another approach: use the formula for the fraction of each species.

The fraction f_k is:

f_k = (β1 β2 ... βk [L]^k ) / (1 + β1 [L] + β1 β2 [L]^2 + ... + β1 β2 ... β4 [L]^4 )

So, for k=2, numerator is β1 beta2 L^2.

Which is 9 *40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 *0.01=3.6.

Denominator is 64.468.

f_2 =3.6 /64.468≈0.0557, 5.57% as before.

But the options are higher. So perhaps I'm miscalculating the βs.

Wait, perhaps the βs are given in a different order, like β4 is for the first complex.

Wait, let me recheck the problem statement.

Stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, that's an unusual order because β4 is lower than β3. Could that mean that adding the fourth ligand is less favorable? Maybe, but I'm not sure if that affects the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up the order of the βs. Maybe β1 is for the four-ligand complex, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the βs are for the reverse formation, like [Co(SCN)_k] dissociating.

No, that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the dithiocyanate complex, but the one with four SCN- ligands. No, the question asks for blue dithiocyanato, which is two SCN-.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect. Maybe the blue dithiocyanato complex has four ligands, but I'm not sure about that. I thought dithiocyanato means two SCN- ligands.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem refers to the tetrathiocyanato complex as the blue one? No, the question says dithiocyanato.

Wait, what if the calculation is for the total of all species except the free Co²+? No, the question includes all Co species.

Hmm. Let me think about the possible options again. The options are:

A) 42.3%

B) 25.6%

C) 38.1%

D) 16.9%

Wait, 5.57% isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is considering the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2] in the total of all complexes except the free Co²+. So the total would be the sum of [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, etc.

In that case, the fraction would be [Co(SCN)_2]/( [CoSCN] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4] )

In this case, the denominator would be sum_terms -1 =64.468 -1=63.468.

So f_2=3.6 /63.468 ≈0.0567 or 5.67%. Still not matching options.

Hmm.

Alternative approach: perhaps the βs are not stepwise but overall, so the fraction is (βk [L]^k )/( sum (βk [L]^k ) +1 )

Wait, for each k:

f_k = (βk [L]^k ) / ( sum (βk [L]^k ) +1 )

But that's not the standard approach. Let me calculate each term:

For k=0: 1 → denominator would include 1.

k=1: β1 [L] =9 *0.1=0.9

k=2: β2 [L]^2=40 *0.01=0.4

k=3:63 *0.001=0.063

k=4:16 *0.0001=0.0016

Sum all the terms:

1 +0.9=1.9 +0.4=2.3 +0.063=2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So f_2 =0.4 /2.3646≈0.169 →16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, that's one of the options. So perhaps this is the correct approach.

But wait, why would the fraction be calculated this way? Because in this case, each βk is the overall constant for the complex with k ligands.

In that case, the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2] would be (β2 * L^2) divided by the sum of all βk L^k plus 1.

But I'm not sure if this is the correct approach, but since the answer is one of the options, perhaps this is what the problem expects.

So, according to this, f_2 =0.4/(2.3646)= approx 16.9%.

Which is option D.

But I'm a bit confused because the standard approach uses stepwise constants, but perhaps the problem uses the overall constants as given. So in that case, the correct answer is D)16.9%.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the fractions based on the overall βs, not stepwise.

Another possibility: perhaps I confused the order of the βs. Let me try using β4 as the second step.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the βs are in a different order, like β1 is for [Co(SCN)_2], but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the βs are given in the order of increasing number of ligands, but with lower β for the fourth ligand.

But that doesn't change the calculation.

Wait, let me think again about the standard approach.

In the standard approach, the fraction for each species is (product β1 to βk [L]^k) divided by the sum of all products up to k=4 plus 1.

So for [Co(SCN)_2], it's (β1 β2 [L]^2 ) / sum_terms.

Which in this case is 3.6 /64.468≈5.57%.

But that's not matching any of the options. So perhaps the initial approach is wrong.

Another approach: perhaps the cobalt can form complexes with other structures, but the problem states only the four βs, so I think that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the product terms.

Wait, let's try to compute each term again.

Compute each term:

Term0:1 → 1

Term1: β1 L =9 *0.1=0.9 → sum=1.9

Term2: β1 * β2 * L^2 → 9*40=360 →360 *0.01=3.6 → sum=5.5

Term3:9 *40*63 *0.1^3 →9*40=360; 360*63=22680 →22680 *0.001=22.68 → sum=28.18

Term4:9 *40*63 *16 *0.1^4 →9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880 →362880 *0.0001=36.288 → sum=64.468.

So all correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex as the sum of all complexes with two ligands.

Wait, perhaps the problem refers to [Co(SCN)_2] as the dithiocyanato complex, but maybe there are two isomers or something, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the sum of [Co(SCN)_2] and [Co(SCN)_4], but that's not what the question says.

Wait, perhaps the blue color is for the tetra-thiocyanato complex. Let me check.

The blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is known as the [Co(en)SCN]Cl2 type, but in this case, it's with SCN- as the ligand. Wait, but I'm not certain about the exact complexes and their colors.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the stability constants in a way where each β is for the complex with that many ligands, and the fraction is calculated as (βk [L]^k) / (sum βk [L]^k +1 )

Which is what I thought earlier.

In that case, let's compute each term:

β1 [L]^1 =9 *0.1=0.9.

β2 [L]^2=40 *0.01=0.4.

β3 [L]^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

β4 [L]^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

sum =0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 =1.3646.

Add the 1 for free Co: total denominator=1+1.3646=2.3646.

So the fraction for k=2 is 0.4 /2.3646≈0.169 →16.9%, which is option D.

But I'm still uncertain because the standard approach uses stepwise constants.

Wait, perhaps the problem is from a source that uses this alternative approach, so the answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the stability constant for [CoSCN]^+ is β1=9, and for each additional SCN-, the next β is for the next ligand.

But if that's the case, then the standard approach gives 5.57%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended approach is the alternative one.

Given that the answer must be one of the options, and 16.9% is an option, perhaps that's the intended answer.

So I'll go with option D)16.9%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants provided and the given concentrations of Co(II) and thiocyanate (SCN⁻). The stability constants are β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16, and the concentrations are [Co(II)] = 10⁻² M and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.

### Key Steps:
1. **Fraction of Each Complex**: The fraction of each cobalt complex is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   f_k = \frac{\beta_1 \beta_2 \dots \beta_k [L]^k}{1 + \beta_1 [L] + \beta_1 \beta_2 [L]^2 + \dots + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [L]^4}
   \]
   where \( [L] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \) is the concentration of SCN⁻.

2. **Numerator for Dithiocyanato Complex**: For the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)₂]²⁺), \( k = 2 \). The numerator is:
   \[
   \beta_1 \beta_2 [L]^2 = 9 \cdot 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 360 \cdot 0.01 = 3.6
   \]

3. **Denominator (Sum of All Terms)**: The denominator is the sum of all terms:
   \[
   \text{Sum} = 1 + \beta_1 [L] + \beta_1 \beta_2 [L]^2 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [L]^3 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [L]^4
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   - \( \beta_1 [L] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
   - \( \beta_1 \beta_2 [L]^2 = 3.6 \)
   - \( \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [L]^3 = 9 \cdot 40 \cdot 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 22680 \cdot 0.001 = 22.68 \)
   - \( \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [L]^4 = 9 \cdot 40 \cdot 63 \cdot 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 362880 \cdot 0.0001 = 36.288 \)

   Adding these:
   \[
   \text{Sum} = 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 + 36.288 = 64.468
   \]

4. **Fraction of Dithiocyanato Complex**: The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex is:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{3.6}{64.468} \approx 0.0557 \, \text{or} \, 5.57\%
   \]

5. **Mismatch with Options**: The calculated fraction (5.57%) does not match any of the given options. This suggests a potential alternative interpretation of the stability constants or the problem setup.

6. **Alternative Approach**: Considering the possibility that the stability constants are used differently, the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex is recalculated using:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [L]^2}{\sum \beta_k [L]^k + 1}
   \]
   Substituting:
   - \( \beta_2 [L]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \)
   - \( \sum \beta_k [L]^k = \beta_1 [L] + \beta_2 [L]^2 + \beta_3 [L]^3 + \beta_4 [L]^4 = 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 1.3646 \)
   - Denominator: \( 1 + 1.3646 = 2.3646 \)

   Thus:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169 \, \text{or} \, 16.9\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.
