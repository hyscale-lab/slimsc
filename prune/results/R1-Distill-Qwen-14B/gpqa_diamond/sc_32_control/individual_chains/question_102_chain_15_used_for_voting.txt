Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology, specifically related to gene expression constructs and their expression in a mouse model. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the setup: There's a new ligand-receptor pair found in neural crest cells. They're trying to understand their developmental roles by using a bicistronic vector. The vector has two ORFs (ligand and receptor) with specific regulatory elements and stop cassettes.

The vector details:
- Ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. It's under the CBA promoter.
- Receptor ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at its C-terminus, and upstream of the receptor is an IRES element.
- Between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP, a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

So, the vector is bicistronic, meaning it can express two proteins from a single transcript using internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) or other methods, but here it's using IRES for the receptor.

They transfected this into primary astrocyte culture, used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, and ran a Western blot. The blot showed signals proportional to actin, which makes sense as a loading control, but after that, they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice. Cre should excise the stop cassettes, allowing expression of both ligand and receptor.

After the offspring are born, they visualize under a confocal. But they didn't see a green signal. The question is why.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But if the ligand and receptor are both expressed in the same cells, could that affect expression? I'm not immediately sure how this would cause no GFP. Because if the ligand-receptor is paracrine, maybe they are secreted, but the construct would still produce the proteins. Maybe if the ligand is secreted and the receptor is on the surface, but without seeing GFP, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed. Hmm, but the problem is about the construct's expression, not necessarily if the ligand-receptor is functional.

Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. So, if the receptor is a transmembrane protein, it's usually in the cell membrane. If it's stuck in the ER or Golgi, it wouldn't reach the cell surface, so antibodies wouldn't detect it. But the Western blot detected the proteins, so unless the blot didn't pick up the GFP because it's retained in the ER. Wait, but the question says the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin, meaning the proteins are being expressed. So maybe the GFP is being made but not properly localized, but in that case, the blot would show the GFP band. But if SOX10-Cre is used, and the construct is in the right place, perhaps the expression is not happening.

Option C: The enhancer is missing. If the CBA promoter alone isn't sufficient, but wait, the construct uses CBA for the ligand and IRES for the receptor. CBA is a strong promoter, so if it's missing the enhancer, maybe the ligand isn't expressed. But the problem is in the mouse model, not in the cell culture. Wait, in the cell culture, they did a Western and saw expression, so the promoter was working. So probably not the enhancer issue.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Oh, wait, the vector has the receptor ORF at the 3' end, with the stop cassette. If the stop cassette is between the receptor and eGFP, then when Cre is introduced, it should excise the stop, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed together. If the stop cassette is in frame, then the receptor would be in frame with eGFP, but if the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP might not be expressed or might produce a nonfunctional protein. So, in this case, the Western blot uses an antibody against the overexpressed proteins. If the eGFP wasn't expressed, the blot wouldn't show a band for it. But the setup says that they used antibodies against overexpressed proteins. So perhaps in the Western, the eGFP wasn't expressed, but the question says they did observe signals proportional to actin. Wait, the blot's signal is proportional to actin, but that's just the loading control. The actual expression of the proteins would show specific bands. So if, after Cre, the eGFP is not expressed, the blot might not show it.

But wait, the mouse is homozygous for the construct, and they crossed it with SOX10-Cre. SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development. Cre would recognize the lox sites. The ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette before mCherry, and the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 before eGFP. Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different sites, right? So, when Cre is introduced, it would only excise the loxP sites, not lox2272. Because Cre recognizes loxP specifically, and other systems like FLP use different sites.

Wait, in the vector, the ligand has a loxP-stop before mCherry, and the receptor has a lox2272-stop before eGFP. So when Cre is used, it would excise the loxP site, but not the lox2272. So the ligand would be expressed (since the stop is removed), but the receptor's stop cassette is a different system (probably FLP recombinase would act on lox2272). So in this case, the receptor would still be blocked because the Cre doesn't act on lox2272.

Wait, but the question says they used SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is a Cre driver. So in the mouse, the Cre would be active in SOX10-expressing cells, which include neural crest derivatives. So in the construct, the ligand's ORF is under CBA promoter. The CBA promoter is constitutive, so the ligand would be expressed in all cells where the construct is active. But the receptor is under IRES, which is after the ligand. But the issue is whether the stop cassettes are being excised.

Ah, in the vector, the ligand is at 5' with loxP-stop-mCherry, and the receptor is at 3' with IRES upstream, then lox2272-stop-eGFP. So Cre would only remove the loxP sites, not the lox2272. So the ligand's stop would be excised, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop cassette is lox2272; Cre won't cut that. So the receptor's ORF would still have the stop cassette between it and eGFP, so the receptor wouldn't be expressed. Wait, no: the receptor is at the 3' end, after the IRES. So the transcript would have the ligand and then the receptor under the IRES. The IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor can be translated separately.

But the stop cassettes are after each ORF. So the ligand has loxP-stop, and the receptor has lox2272-stop. So, when Cre is introduced, it would only excise the loxP in the ligand's cassette, but not the lox2272 in the receptor's. So the ligand would be expressed (since the stop is gone), but the receptor's expression would not be affected because the stop is in a different site. Wait, but the lox2272 would require FLP recombinase, not Cre. So in the mouse, the Cre wouldn't remove the lox2272 stop, so the receptor's eGFP would not be expressed.

Wait, but the vector has the receptor ORF followed by a stop in lox2272. So when the Cre is introduced, it doesn't affect the receptor's stop. So the receptor's ORF is still under the IRES, but after that, the stop cassette remains. So the receptor would not be expressed because the stop is in the way. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, hence no green signal in the confocal.

But why did the Western blot show the proteins? Because in the cell culture, maybe they didn't use Cre, so the stop cassettes were in place. Wait, the question says they tested the construct expression on the Western blot after plasmid transfection. So in the plasmid, before Cre, the stop cassettes are present. So the ligand and mCherry would be expressed only if the loxP is excised. But in the plasmid, without Cre, the stop is in place, so ligand and mCherry wouldn't be expressed. Wait, no, because the plasmid is a bicistronic vector; the ligand is under its own promoter, so without the stop, perhaps the ligand is expressed. Wait, the vector setup is a bit confusing.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic, meaning one transcript. So the transcript would start with the ligand (under CBA), then the IRES for the receptor, then the receptor. The ligand is fused to mCherry. So the ligand's ORF is followed by a stop in a loxP cassette, and the receptor's ORF is followed by a stop in a lox2272 cassette. So when Cre is present, it would excise the loxP, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop remains because it's a different site.

But in the absence of Cre (like in the plasmid before transfection into the mouse model), the ligand's ORF is followed by a stop, so the ligand would be expressed, but not mCherry. The receptor's ORF is followed by a stop, so the receptor wouldn't be expressed either. But wait, the vector is designed so that each ORF is separated by a stop cassette. So in the absence of Cre, only the ligand would be expressed, with mCherry, but the stop would prevent the downstream mCherry from being expressed. Wait, no, the ligand is fused to mCherry, so the ligand is at the N-terminus, and mCherry is C-terminus. So without the stop, mCherry would be expressed, but if the stop is in a loxP cassette, perhaps the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry only when the stop is removed.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's go back to the question.

After the mouse is born, they look for GFP. But no green. So why is the GFP not expressed?

If the GFP is under the receptor ORF and requires the stop cassette to be removed, but the Cre doesn't recognize the lox2272 site. So the stop remains, so the GFP isn't expressed.

So in the mouse, the construct is in the genome, and the Cre is introduced (from SOX10-Cre). But the Cre can only cut loxP sites. The ligand's stop is a loxP, so it gets excised, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop is lox2272, which Cre doesn't cut. So the stop remains, so the receptor and eGFP are not expressed.

Wait, but the receptor is under IRES. So in the vector, the receptor's ORF is after the IRES, which is after the ligand. So the transcript is ligand, then IRES, then receptor. So the IRES allows the ribosome to translate the receptor even if a stop codon is present earlier in the transcript. Wait, no. The IRES is a way to have two separate ORFs in one transcript. So the ligand is under the promoter, then the IRES, then the receptor. So the transcript is ligand mRNA, then the IRES, then receptor. So without the stop cassette, the receptor would be expressed as part of the same transcript, but with the stop, it's blocked.

Wait, the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. So the receptor's ORF is followed by a stop in a lox2272 cassette. So without excision, the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP is not. But wait, the eGFP is at the C-terminus of the receptor. So if the stop is after the receptor, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

Wait, perhaps the way the construct is set up is that the ligand is 5', then the IRES, then the receptor, which is followed by a stop cassette. So without Cre, the stop is in place, so the receptor is not expressed. But when Cre is present, it cuts the lox2272 site, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but the loxP is for the ligand, and lox2272 is for the receptor. So in the mouse, which is homozygous for the construct, and crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre would only excise the loxP in the ligand's cassette, but not the lox2272 in the receptor's cassette. So ligand and mCherry would be expressed, but the receptor and eGFP would not. Therefore, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, so no green signal.

So which option explains this?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. If that's the case, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the ORF is disrupted. But in this case, the problem is that the Cre isn't acting on the lox2272 site. So the stop remains, preventing expression.

Wait, but in that case, the eGFP would not be expressed because the stop is there. So the Western blot would not show eGFP. But the question said the blot was done after plasmid transfection, not after the mouse was born. So when they transfected the plasmid, they probably didn't have Cre, so the stop cassettes were present. So the ligand and mCherry wouldn't be expressed, and the receptor and eGFP wouldn't either. But the question says the Western blot showed a signal proportional to actin. So maybe the actin loading is correct, but the actual proteins may or may not be expressed.

Wait, perhaps when they made the mouse, the construct was in the germline, so Cre would have acted during development. So the ligand's stop is cut, so ligand and mCherry are expressed, but the receptor's stop remains, so receptor and eGFP are not. So in the mouse, only mCherry would be expressed, but not eGFP.

But in the question, they're looking for eGFP under the confocal. So no green signal. So why? Because the eGFP wasn't expressed.

So the reason is that the stop cassette for the receptor isn't being excised because Cre doesn't recognize lox2272. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, looking at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean the fusion protein is not correctly formed, but the problem here is whether the eGFP is expressed at all. So option D is about the ORF being in frame, but the issue here is the stop cassette not being excised, which isn't one of the options.

Wait, the options don't include that. So looking again:

Option C says the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the CBA promoter is a strong constitutive promoter, so probably not. Plus, in the Western blot, when they transfected the plasmid, they should have seen expression unless the stop is in the way.

Wait, maybe in the plasmid, without Cre, the ligand and receptor stops are in place. So when they did the Western blot, they didn't see the proteins. But the question says the blot showed a signal, which suggests that the proteins were expressed. Hmm, conflicting info.

Wait, the question says: "the Western blot gives a signal proportional to the actin loading. You finally breed a mouse model homozygous for your construct in the wt background."

Wait, perhaps the Western blot was done after the plasmid was transfected into primary astrocyte culture, and the blot detected the expression. But when they made the mouse, perhaps the expression isn't happening. But why?

Alternatively, perhaps the loxP and lox2272 are on the same construct, but Cre doesn't cut lox2272. So the ligand's stop is cut, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed, but the receptor's stop remains, so receptor and eGFP aren't expressed.

But looking at the options, none of them directly state that the Cre isn't acting on the lox2272 site. So perhaps the correct answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, no. If the stop is in the way, the receptor wouldn't be expressed. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed either. So the blot would show no eGFP. But the question says the blot detected the proteins, perhaps because the construct is in the cells.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is with the expression in the mouse, not in the cell culture. So in the mouse, Cre is expressed, but it can't excise the receptor's stop because it's a different site. So the eGFP isn't expressed, leading to no green signal.

But the question asks which option explains the lack of a green signal.

Looking again at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are paracrine. So maybe the ligand is secreted and the receptor is on the cell surface. But this wouldn't prevent eGFP expression.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. If they were expressed, but not at the surface, the Western would show the protein but not the GFP. But the blot may not detect eGFP.

C) Missing enhancer. But the CBA promoter is strong.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the ORF is disrupted, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but in the vector design, the receptor is followed by a stop cassette, which uses lox2272. So unless that stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is that the stop isn't being excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

But none of the options directly state this. So perhaps the answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the ORF isn't in frame, the eGFP is not expressed, leading to no signal.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette is in the way, so the receptor isn't expressed, so eGFP isn't either. But in this case, the problem is that the stop isn't excised, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the Western blot, which detected the proteins, was done without Cre, so the stops were in place, but the blot showed signals. Wait, that doesn't make sense because stops would prevent expression.

Wait, perhaps I need to think again.

The vector is bicistronic. The ligand is at 5', with a stop in loxP. The receptor is at 3', with a stop in lox2272. Between the ligand and mCherry is the loxP stop. Between receptor and eGFP is lox2272 stop.

In the mouse, when Cre is introduced (from SOX10-Cre), it will excise the loxP sites, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed. But the lox2272 stop remains, so the receptor and eGFP are not expressed.

So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is still present. So why? Because the stop is in a lox2272 cassette, which Cre can't cut. So the eGFP remains unexpressed. Therefore, the confocal doesn't show green.

But how does that relate to the options? Looking back:

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would cause the eGFP not to be expressed. So the scenario here is similar: eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is there.

Wait, but the actual reason is that the stop isn't excised. So the correct answer is not among the options. But perhaps the correct option is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector's design has the receptor not in frame with the eGFP. So when the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP are not co-expressed.

Wait, the vector has the receptor ORF followed by a stop in the lox2272 cassette, then eGFP. So the eGFP is after the stop. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP would be expressed as a separate ORF. Wait, no. The stop is between the receptor and eGFP. So the eGFP is after the stop. So when the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP would be in the same ORF, meaning that the receptor is fused to eGFP, but only if the stop is removed and they're in frame.

Wait, perhaps the stop cassette is in the way, but if it's removed, the frames matter.

Wait, perhaps the stop is in frame, so when it's removed, the receptor is in frame with the eGFP. So the eGFP is expressed as a fusion with the receptor. If the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But in the mouse model, the stop isn't removed because it's a lox2272 site, which Cre can't cut. So the eGFP isn't expressed, hence no green.

So looking at the options, none directly address this. So perhaps the correct answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, but in reality, the frame would matter only if the stop is removed. If the stop isn't removed, then even if the ORFs are in frame, it won't matter because the stop is in the way. So the real issue is that the stop remains, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But none of the options address the stop not being cut. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's reevaluate the vector design.

The vector is a bicistronic construct with two cassettes, each with their own stop. The ligand is first, followed by a loxP stop, then mCherry. The receptor is after an IRES, followed by a lox2272 stop, then eGFP.

In the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed (because the CBA promoter is active), but the stop after it prevents mCherry from being expressed. The receptor is under an IRES, but the stop after it prevents eGFP expression.

When Cre is introduced, it only cuts loxP, so the ligand's stop is removed, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop remains, so the receptor and eGFP are not expressed.

So, in the mouse model, only ligand and mCherry should be expressed, not receptor and eGFP. So when they look for eGFP in the offspring, they don't see it.

So why is the eGFP not expressed? Because the stop cassette for the receptor isn't excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

But none of the options directly address this. The closest is option D, which is about the ORF being in frame. If the stop wasn't in the way, but the ORFs were out of frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But in this case, the problem is the stop, not the frame.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the design is that the loxP and lox2272 are on the same construct, but Cre can't cut both. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question says that the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor has IRES upstream. So perhaps the issue is that the IRES isn't allowing the receptor to be expressed.

Wait, IRES elements allow for the translation of a second ORF in the same transcript. So the ligand is translated first, then the IRES allows the receptor to be translated. But the stop after the receptor would prevent eGFP from being expressed unless the stop is removed.

But in the mouse, the stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

So the question is why no green. It's because the eGFP isn't expressed. The reason is that the stop isn't excised because the lox2272 isn't cut by Cre.

But the options don't include this. So perhaps the intended answer is D, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct was designed with the eGFP in the same frame as the receptor, but when the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. So if the stop was present and not removed, the eGFP isn't expressed, so no green signal.

So the correct answer would be D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame.

Wait, but the frame is only an issue if the stop is removed. So I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the loxP and lox2272 are on different sites, but the IRES is after the ligand and before the receptor. So when Cre is introduced, it might not affect the receptor's expression. Wait, no. The IRES is before the receptor, but the stop is after the receptor.

Wait, perhaps the IRES is between the ligand and receptor. So the transcript is ligand, then IRES, then receptor. The ligand's stop is after the ligand, but the receptor's stop is after the receptor.

So when Cre is introduced, it cuts the ligand's stop, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop remains, so the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed.

Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop remains, but the reason is that Cre can't cut lox2272. So the absence of the green signal is due to the stop not being excised.

But the options don't have this, so perhaps the intended answer is D or another.

Wait, perhaps the way the vector is set up, the IRES is in the wrong place, so the receptor isn't expressed. But then the answer would relate to the IRES not working, which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is option D. So I'll go with that.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair, with specific regulatory elements and stop cassettes. The ligand is at the 5' end, under the CBA promoter, fused to mCherry, and contains a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. The receptor is at the 3' end, under an IRES element, fused to eGFP, and contains a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. The vector was introduced into a mouse model homozygous for the construct, crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, and the offspring were analyzed for eGFP expression under confocal microscopy. No green signal was observed, and the question asks for the most likely explanation.

### Key Analysis of the Vector and Experimental Setup:
1. **Vector Design**:
   - The ligand and receptor are co-expressed from a single transcript.
   - The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is translated via an IRES element.
   - The ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, while the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

2. **Role of Cre**:
   - SOX10-Cre mice express Cre, which specifically recognizes and excises loxP sites but not lox2272 sites.
   - In the mouse model, Cre would excise the loxP stop cassette, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed.
   - The lox2272 stop cassette remains intact, preventing receptor and eGFP expression.

3. **Observed Outcome**:
   - After crossing with SOX10-Cre mice, no green signal (eGFP) was observed under confocal microscopy.
   - This indicates that eGFP is not being expressed.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship)**:
  - A paracrine relationship would not prevent eGFP expression. This option does not explain the lack of fluorescence.

- **Option B (The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi)**:
  - If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, it would still be expressed but not localized to the cell surface. However, the Western blot would detect the protein, and this does not align with the observed absence of eGFP expression.

- **Option C (The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing)**:
  - The CBA promoter is a strong constitutive promoter, so the absence of an enhancer is unlikely to prevent expression. Additionally, the Western blot showed protein expression, indicating the promoter is functional.

- **Option D (The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame)**:
  - If the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, eGFP would not be expressed. This aligns with the observed lack of fluorescence. However, the primary issue is that the lox2272 stop cassette remains unexcised, preventing eGFP expression. While this option partially explains the outcome, it does not directly address the stop cassette mechanism.

### Conclusion:
The absence of eGFP expression is due to the lox2272 stop cassette remaining intact, as Cre cannot excise lox2272 sites. This prevents receptor and eGFP expression. Among the given options, **Option D** ("the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame") is the closest explanation, as it indirectly accounts for the lack of eGFP expression.

Answer: D
