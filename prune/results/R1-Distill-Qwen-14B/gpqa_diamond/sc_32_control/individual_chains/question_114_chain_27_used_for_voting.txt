Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for each of these reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So reacting ketones with cyanide usually involves a nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, the product is a nitrile and a hydroxy group. I remember that when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. But in this case, it's NaCN. NaCN is a source of CN- ions, so maybe it's an addition reaction.

So the reaction is (CH3)2CO + NaCN → (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but looking at the product, it's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me check the structure. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CN, but with substituents.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile? Or wait, butanenitrile has four carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, butane is four carbons. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? No, perhaps it's CH2(CH2)2CN. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with HCN, it forms (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, right? Because the ketone is at position 2 in a three-carbon chain. Wait, but the product here is butanenitrile, which implies four carbons. So maybe the starting material is different. Oh wait, maybe butan-2-one is (CH2)2CO, but no, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO.

Wait, perhaps the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would have four carbons. So maybe the addition is leading to a four-carbon chain. Hmm, perhaps the starting ketone is longer. Or maybe I'm getting the structures wrong.

Wait, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Wait, but butanenitrile is four carbons in total, so maybe the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, that would be five carbons. Hmm, perhaps the product is (CH3)2CH(OH)CH2CN? No, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure. Maybe I should focus on the reaction type.

So, the first reaction is a ketone reacting with cyanide. I know that ketones can undergo addition reactions with HCN to form cyanohydrins. The general reaction is ketone + HCN → cyanohydrin. But in this case, NaCN is used. So NaCN is a source of CN- in a solution, perhaps with some acid.

Wait, but to get the addition of CN- to the ketone, you probably need some acid catalysis. Because the mechanism for HCN addition to ketones usually involves acid, which protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. So the reagent A would need to be an acid, like H3O+.

So reagent A is H3O+ (acid). That would make sense because the cyanide ion would attack the carbonyl carbon, and then the proton would be picked up from the acid to form water, leading to the hydroxy group.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+.

Now, moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it's reacting with reagent B and water to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, nitrile to carboxylic acid. How does that happen? I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions to carboxylic acids. There are different methods: one is hydrolysis with strong acid and heat, or using a strong base like KMnO4 under acidic conditions.

Wait, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So the reaction is converting the nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The reagents involved would be for nitrile hydrolysis.

The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be done in different ways. One common method is using a strong acid and water, perhaps with heat. Alternatively, using KMnO4 under acidic conditions can also do the job.

In this case, the reagent B is given as H2O. Wait, but the reaction is written as [2-hydroxybutanenitrile] + B (H2O) → [2-hydroxybutanoic acid]. So B is a reagent, and H2O is part of the reaction.

Wait, but the reagent B is given as either HCl or CH3COOH. Wait, looking back at the options, the choices for B are HCl, CH3COOH, etc.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the conditions for nitrile hydrolysis. One method is acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, which typically uses a strong acid like H2SO4, along with heat. Alternatively, under basic conditions, but that usually gives a carboxylate which can be acidified.

Wait, but the problem states that B is H2O. Or perhaps, wait, the reaction is written as:

2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, perhaps I misread that. The reagent is B, and the solvent is H2O. So B is the catalyst or the acid.

So, nitrile to carboxylic acid in presence of H2O and reagent B. So what conditions are needed here.

If B is HCl, then it's an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. Alternatively, if B is CH3COOH, that's a milder acid.

Wait, nitriles can be hydrolyzed using strong acids like HCl with H2O and heat. Alternatively, in the presence of a strong oxidizing agent like KMnO4 under acidic conditions, nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids. But in this case, the reagent is B, and the product is the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the reaction is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile → 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps this is a hydrolysis reaction. Nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylic acids under acidic conditions with H2O. So the reagent would be an acid catalyst, like H3O+ or HCl.

Looking at the options, for B, the choices are either HCl or CH3COOH.

So HCl would be a strong acid, which could protonate the nitrile and help in the hydrolysis. Alternatively, if B is CH3COOH, which is a weak acid, maybe it's enough.

Wait, but sometimes in such reactions, especially when the nitrile is in a hindered position (like next to a hydroxyl group), you might need stronger conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is done under basic conditions, but in this case, the product is a carboxylic acid, which suggests acidic conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an oxidation. But nitriles to carboxylic acids can also be done via oxidation. For example, using KMnO4 under acidic conditions.

Wait, but the reagent is B, which is either HCl or CH3COOH. So KMnO4 isn't an option. So perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction.

So, which acid is used for hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids? I think concentrated HCl with heat is a typical condition. So if B is HCl, that would make sense.

Wait, but in the product, the hydroxyl group is still present. So if the starting material has a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile, converting the nitrile to a carboxylic acid would lead to a geminal diol. Wait, no. Wait, the starting material is 2-hydroxy-2-(4-benzylphenyl)butanenitrile. So it's (Ph-C6H4-CH2-C(OH)CH2-CN). Wait, maybe it's (Ph group attached to the same carbon as the hydroxyl and nitrile groups). So when the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid, the structure becomes (Ph group) attached to a carbon which has a hydroxyl and a carboxylic acid group. Wait, that's possible?

Wait, but if the nitrile is at a certain position, the hydrolysis would add two oxygen atoms. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused about the structure. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile group is at a different position.

Wait, perhaps the second reaction is a hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. So the reaction is:

R-CN + H2O → R-COOH.

And this is typically done under acidic conditions, perhaps with HCl as the catalyst.

So for the second reaction, reagent B is HCl.

Now, looking back at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl. That would fit our analysis.

Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weaker acid. Would that be sufficient for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to carboxylic acid? I'm not sure. Maybe HCl is a stronger acid and more effective.

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl.

Hmm, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which is an acid (HSO3- is a weak acid). But why would the first reaction use that?

The first reaction was between butan-2-one and NaCN with A. So if A is NaHSO3, that would mean the reaction is in an acidic solution because HSO3- is a weak acid but can protonate.

Wait, but I thought the first reaction required H3O+ as the acid catalyst. So if A is H3O+, that would be option A or B. If A is NaHSO3, which is a source of H+ (since HSO3- can donate a proton), that could also work, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the first reaction doesn't require a strong acid. Let me think about the mechanism. The addition of CN- to a ketone requires an acid catalyst. So A must be an acid, either H3O+ or another acid like H2SO4 or NaHSO3.

In the options, the choices for A are H3O+ or NaHSO3.

So if A is NaHSO3, then the solution would be acidic enough for the cyanide attack.

So which is correct? Let's think about the conditions for cyanohydrin formation.

In the cyanohydrin formation, the ketone reacts with HCN in the presence of an acid catalyst, like H2SO4 or H3O+.

But NaHSO3 is also a source of H+ (bisulfate is a weak acid). So perhaps that could work as an acid catalyst.

So option D: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH.

Wait, but then B would be acetic acid. If B is a weak acid, would that be sufficient for nitrile hydrolysis? Because nitrile hydrolysis under weak acid might not proceed efficiently, while HCl (a strong acid) would.

So, considering this:

First reaction: requires acid (A is H3O+ or NaHSO3).

Second reaction: requires acid (B is HCl or CH3COOH).

If option A has B as HCl, which is better for nitrile hydrolysis, that would make sense.

So for the first reaction, if A is H3O+, that would be option A or B. But which one?

Wait, the first reaction uses NaCN. So in solution, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So if the solution is acidic, the CN- would be protonated to HCN, which is a weaker base and perhaps more nucleophilic? Or wait, in acidic conditions, the CN- would be protonated to HCN, which is a weaker nucleophile. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, no. Wait, in the presence of acid, the CN- would be protonated to HCN, which is a weaker base but maybe less nucleophilic. But for the addition to the carbonyl, perhaps the CN- is needed as the nucleophile.

So the initial step in the mechanism is the attack of the nucleophile (CN-) on the carbonyl carbon. To facilitate this, the carbonyl oxygen is protonated, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. But if the solution is too acidic, the CN- might not be available as a nucleophile because it's protonated to HCN.

Wait, so maybe the reaction doesn't require a strong acid. Or perhaps the reaction uses a mild acid. NaHSO3 is a weaker acid than H3O+ (which is a strong acid). So perhaps in the first reaction, NaHSO3 is the acid catalyst, making the solution mildly acidic, allowing CN- to act as a nucleophile.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is done without a strong acid because the cyanide is a strong enough nucleophile.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to think in terms of the options. Let's look at the options again.

Options are:
A) A = H3O+, B = HCl
B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH
C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl
D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

If in the first reaction, A is H3O+, that would be option A or B. If A is NaHSO3, that's option C or D.

Now, let's think about the second reaction. If in second reaction, B is HCl (option A), that would lead to a stronger acid condition for nitrile hydrolysis, which would be more effective.

So for the second reaction, using HCl (B = HCl) would be better. So that would suggest option A or C.

Wait, but the first reaction: if A is H3O+, that would be a strong acid. But in the presence of strong acid, would the cyanide stay as CN-? I'm not sure. Because in strong acid, CN- would be protonated to HCN, which is a weaker nucleophile.

Hmm, perhaps the acid used in the first reaction is not too strong. So maybe it's a weak acid like NaHSO3.

Wait, let me think about the process. The addition of HCN to ketones typically uses a mild acid as a catalyst. For example, HCN is added to ketones under acidic conditions, perhaps using HCl or H2SO4 as catalysts. Alternatively, sometimes the reaction is done without a strong acid because HCN is a weak acid and can act as the proton source.

Wait, but in this case, the reagent is NaCN. So perhaps the solution is made acidic by adding H+ to allow the CN- to attack the carbonyl. But in strong acid, CN- converts to HCN, which is less nucleophilic. So maybe a mild acid is better.

So if A is NaHSO3, which is a weaker acid than H3O+, then more CN- remains available for the nucleophilic attack.

So in the first reaction, using NaHSO3 (A) as the acid catalyst would be better for the cyanide addition.

Then, for the second reaction, using HCl (B) would provide the strong acid needed for the nitrile hydrolysis.

So looking at the options, that would be option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl.

But wait, looking back, option C is A=NaHSO3 and B=HCl.

So, does that fit?

Yes. Because in the first step, NaHSO3 provides a mild acid (HSO3- is a weak acid), so CN- can attack the ketone. In the second step, HCl provides the strong acid needed for the nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, if the first reaction uses H3O+ (strong acid), it might not work because CN- would be protonated. So that might not favor the reaction.

Wait, but wait, maybe the reaction uses excess CN- so that even if some is protonated, enough remains to do the addition. Or perhaps the solution is buffered to a certain pH.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction uses H3O+ as the acid, and that works because the NaCN provides enough CN- concentration to proceed despite some protonation.

So in that case, option A would be correct: A = H3O+, B=HCl.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

In the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. The product is a cyanohydrin, which is formed via addition of CN- to the ketone. So the reaction likely requires an acid catalyst.

If the solution is strongly acidic (H3O+), the CN- would be protonated to HCN, which is a weaker nucleophile. So the reaction might not proceed as readily. On the other hand, a mild acid (like NaHSO3) would allow some CN- to remain unprotonated, making it a better nucleophile for the attack.

Therefore, NaHSO3 (A) is a better choice for the first reaction.

So for the first reaction, A is NaHSO3.

For the second reaction, B is HCl, because it's a strong acid needed for the nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid.

So the correct option is C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

Yes. So option C is the correct answer.

Wait, but another thought: the product of the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That suggests that the cyanide added to the ketone in a way that the hydroxyl and nitrile groups are on the same carbon.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when CN- adds, you get (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. But the product is butanenitrile. Hmm, maybe butanenitrile refers to four carbons in the chain. So perhaps the starting ketone is different. Or perhaps I'm miscounting the carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is added to the carbonyl group, making a four-membered molecule. But butan-2-one has three carbons (propan-2-one is acetone), wait no. Wait butan-2-one is (CH2CH2CO), but that's not possible. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is three carbons (acetone). So the product would have three carbons plus the nitrile and hydroxyl groups. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

But regardless, the reaction is a cyanohydrin formation, requiring acid. So the key point is that the first reaction uses an acid catalyst, and the second uses HCl.

So the correct option is C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the suitable reagents for two reactions:

1. **Reaction 1**: butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.  
   - Butan-2-one ((CH₃)₂CO) undergoes nucleophilic addition with CN⁻ to form a cyanohydrin.  
   - The reaction requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic for CN⁻ to attack.  
   - Among the options, NaHSO₃ (a mild acid) is better than H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) because it allows CN⁻ to remain available for nucleophilic attack without excessive protonation to HCN.

2. **Reaction 2**: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B and water to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.  
   - This is a nitrile hydrolysis reaction, converting the nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid (-COOH).  
   - Strong acid conditions, such as HCl, are typically required for efficient hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.  
   - CH₃COOH (a weak acid) is less effective for this transformation compared to HCl.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  - H₃O⁺ is a strong acid, which may protonate CN⁻ to HCN, reducing its nucleophilicity in Reaction 1. This makes it less favorable.  
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  - CH₃COOH is a weak acid, insufficient for efficient nitrile hydrolysis in Reaction 2.  
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  - NaHSO₃ provides mild acidic conditions, allowing CN⁻ to remain available for nucleophilic attack in Reaction 1. HCl is a strong acid, making it effective for nitrile hydrolysis in Reaction 2.  
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  - While NaHSO₃ is suitable for Reaction 1, CH₃COOH is insufficient for Reaction 2 due to its weak acidity.

### Conclusion:
The best choice is **Option C**, where A = NaHSO₃ and B = HCl. NaHSO₃ provides the mild acid needed for Reaction 1, and HCl provides the strong acid needed for Reaction 2.

**Answer: C**
