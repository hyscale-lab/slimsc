Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to think it through. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator P is given with its X, Y, and Z components. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, the operator P is a vector operator, and when you go along a direction n, the operator in that direction would be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction's components.

Wait, no, actually, the operator in the arbitrary direction n would be the dot product of the vector operator P with the unit vector n. So, P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z, right?

But wait, the direction n is lying in the x-z plane. So the y-component of n would be zero. So the direction vector n can be expressed as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), I think. Because in the x-z plane, the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, perhaps. Like, polar coordinates but in x-z instead of the usual x-y.

Wait, no, wait. The direction n has components (n_x, n_y, n_z). Since it's in x-z plane, n_y must be zero. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z), and since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1. So we can write n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ? Or maybe the other way around. Wait, let me think about the standard spherical coordinates. Normally, the polar angle θ is from the z-axis, so x = sinθ cosφ, z = cosθ. Oh wait, but here, the direction is in x-z plane, so φ is zero. So yeah, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, but wait, that depends on the convention. Alternatively, maybe n_x is cosθ and n_z is sinθ. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me clarify.

Actually, for a direction in x-z plane, the angle θ could be measured from the z-axis. So, the direction vector would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, right? Or perhaps the other way around. Wait, if θ is 0, we're along the z-axis: so n_x would be 0, n_z=1. If θ is 90 degrees, then n_x is 1. So yeah, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. So the direction vector is (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

Wait, but the problem says "arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane". So the operator we're looking at is P_n = n · P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z, since n_y is zero.

Now, the operator P has components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

So, given:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Let me compute that. n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ.

So P_n = (sinθ) * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + (cosθ) * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Factor out ħ/2:

P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix inside:

The top-left element is cosθ * 1, since from [[1,0],[0,-1]] the (1,1) element is 1 multiplied by cosθ.

The top-right element is sinθ * 1 (from [[0,1]]), so that's sinθ.

Similarly, the bottom-left element is sinθ * 1.

The bottom-right element is cosθ * (-1) → -cosθ.

So the matrix becomes:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

So P_n is (ħ/2) times this matrix.

Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. Let me re-calculate:

Wait, the P_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when multiplied by sinθ, it's:

[ [0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0] ]

Similarly, P_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]] multiplied by cosθ:

[ [cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ] ]

Adding these two matrices:

Top-left: cosθ + 0? No wait, wait. Wait, the addition is element-wise. So, the top left is cosθ *1 (from P_z term) plus sinθ * 0 (from P_x term), which is just cosθ.

Top-right is sinθ *1 (from P_x) plus cosθ *0 (from P_z) → sinθ.

Bottom-left is sinθ *1 (from P_x) plus cosθ *0 → sinθ.

Bottom-right is cosθ*(-1) (from P_z) plus sinθ * 0 → -cosθ.

So the matrix is:

[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So P_n = (ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Wait, no, wait. Because P_x is (ħ/2) times that matrix, and P_z is (ħ/2) times another. So when you add them, you factor out (ħ/2):

P_n = (ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Wait, that's correct.

Now, we're looking for the eigenvector of P_n with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>.

Substituting the matrix expression:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

We can divide both sides by (ħ/2) (assuming ħ≠0, which it isn't), so:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] |ψ> = |ψ>

So, the matrix equation is:

[cosθ   sinθ] [a]   = [a]
[sinθ  -cosθ] [b]     [b]

Which gives two equations:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a

sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let me write these as:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0   → Equation (1)

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0   → Equation (2)

Hmm, solving this system.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix.

Wait, the matrix is M = [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

We can find the eigenvalues by solving det(M - λ I) =0.

So, the determinant is (cosθ - λ) (-cosθ - λ) - sinθ * sinθ = 0

Expanding:

( (cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) ) - (sin²θ) ) =0

Multiply the terms:

(cosθ)(-cosθ) + cosθ (-λ) - λ (-cosθ) + λ^2 ) - sin²θ =0

Wait, perhaps a better way is:

= (cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) - sin²θ = 0

Expanding (a - λ)(-a -λ) = -(a - λ)(a + λ) )= - (a² - λ²) )= λ² - a². So, in this case, a is cosθ.

Wait, so (cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) = (-cosθ)(cosθ - λ) - λ (cosθ - λ) )

Wait, perhaps better to compute it as (cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) = (-cosθ)(cosθ - λ) - λ (cosθ - λ) → No, maybe better to just expand:

= [cosθ * (-cosθ) ) + cosθ*(-λ) + (-λ)*(-cosθ) + (-λ)*(-λ) ]

= - cos²θ - λ cosθ + λ cosθ + λ²

Simplify: -cos²θ + λ².

So the determinant equation becomes:

( -cos²θ + λ² ) - sin²θ = 0.

So, λ² = cos²θ + sin²θ = 1.

So λ = ±1.

Ah, so the eigenvalues are +1 and -1.

So, the eigenvalue +1 corresponds to the eigenvalue equation M |ψ> = 1 |ψ>.

So, the eigenvector for λ=1.

So, substituting λ=1 into the matrix equation (M - I)|ψ>=0.

Matrix becomes:

[cosθ -1, sinθ      ]

[sinθ,    -cosθ -1 ]

So, the equations are:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0 → equation (1)

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0 → equation (2)

Let me take equation (1):

(cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ) ] b.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to express a in terms of b.

Alternatively, let's take equation (1):

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b =0 → a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ) ] b.

Because (cosθ -1) = -(1 - cosθ), so:

a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ) ] * b.

But 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So, sinθ/(1 - cosθ) = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] / [2 sin² (θ/2) ) ] = [ cos(θ/2) ] / [ sin(θ/2) ) ] = cot(θ/2).

So a = cot(θ/2) * b.

Hmm, but perhaps it's better to write the ratio a/b = cot(θ/2).

Alternatively, let me pick b as a parameter, say b=1, then a=cot(theta/2). But let's see.

Wait, so the eigen vector is [a, b] where a = [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ) ] b.

So, choosing b=1, then a = [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ) ].

Alternatively, we can represent the eigenvector in terms of theta.

But wait, perhaps the better approach is to find the normalized eigenvector.

So, the vector is proportional to [a, b] where a = [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ) ] * b.

Let me set b = t, then a = [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ) ] t.

So the vector is [ [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ) t, t ]

We can factor out t, so the vector is t [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ), 1 ]

Hmm, but to normalize it, the sum of squares must be 1.

So, the vector is proportional to [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ), 1 ].

Let me compute the normalization factor.

Compute [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ) ]^2 + 1^2.

Hmm, 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So:

sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [2 sin²(theta/2) ) ] = [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ] = cot(theta/2).

So, [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ) ]^2 = cot²(theta/2) = [ cos²(theta/2) ) / sin²(theta/2) ]

So, the sum becomes [ cos²(theta/2) / sin²(theta/2) ) ] + 1 = [ cos² + sin² ] / sin²(theta/2) ) = 1 / sin²(theta/2).

Because [cos² + sin²(theta/2)] is 1.

So sqrt( sum ) is 1 / sin(theta/2).

So the normalized vector would be [ sin(theta/2) * cot(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, because the original vector is [ a, b ] = [ [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ) * t, t ].

Wait, no, let's see. The unnormalized vector is [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ), 1 ].

The norm is sqrt( [ (sinθ/(1 - cosθ))^2 + 1 ] ) = 1 / sin(theta/2).

Wait, because (1 - cosθ) = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ=2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So:

[ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ) ]^2 = [ (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) / (2 sin²(theta/2)) ) ]^2 = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ]^2 = cot²(theta/2).

So the sum is cot²(theta/2) + 1 = csc²(theta/2).

So the norm is sqrt(csc²(theta/2)) ) = 1 / sin(theta/2).

Thus, the normalized vector is [ sin(theta/2) * cot(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ) ].

Wait, wait, no. Let me do this correctly.

The unnormalized vector is [ a, b ] = [ [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ), 1 ]

Which is [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]

So the norm squared is [ cot^2(theta/2) + 1 ] = csc^2(theta/2) → norm is 1/sin(theta/2).

So to normalize, each component is multiplied by sin(theta/2).

So the normalized vector is:

[ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), 1 * sin(theta/2) ]

But cot(theta/2) is [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ), so:

First component: [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) * sin(theta/2) ] = cos(theta/2)

Second component: sin(theta/2)

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, does this make sense? Let me think.

Wait, when theta is 0 (along z), the direction is (0,0,1). So the operator P_z has eigenstates |+> = [1,0] and |-> = [0,1]. So for theta=0, the eigenvector should be [1, 0], since eigenvalue +ħ/2 is P_z |+> = (ħ/2)(1)|+>.

Wait, but according to our result, for theta=0, the eigenvector is [cos(0/2), sin(0/2)] = [cos0, sin0] → [1, 0], which matches.

Another test: theta=90 degrees (along x). Then the eigenvector would be [cos(45), sin(45)] = [ sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ]

Which makes sense, because P_x has eigenvalues ±ħ/2, and eigenstates are [1,1]/sqrt(2) and [1,-1]/sqrt(2). So the eigenstate for +ħ/2 is [1,1]/sqrt(2), which is [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2], which matches our result.

So, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is this. So option C is a candidate.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A) (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ)

B) (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)) 

C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

D) (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2))

Hmm, so the normalized vector I found is option C.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the eigenstates can have any phase, but the components are typically real for spin-1/2 systems, but in the problem, perhaps the operator could have complex components? Wait, the operator P has real and imaginary components, but in the end, the eigenvector for spin in a direction is real and can be expressed in terms of sines and cosines.

Wait, but in our calculation, the eigenvector came out as [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], which is option C.

But looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So the answer is option C. But wait, let me think about the structure of the problem again.

Wait, the operator P is the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Because:

sigma_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
sigma_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
sigma_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, P is the vector operator (ħ/2) sigma · n.

So, the operator along direction n is (ħ/2) (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z )

Wait, but in our case, n is in x-z plane, so n_y=0.

So, the operator is (ħ/2) (n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z )

Which is the same as (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Wait, that's a familiar form. The eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, and the eigenvectors are such that for eigenvalue +ħ/2, the eigenvector is [n_z, n_x]^T, normalized.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again.

Matrix is (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

The eigenvalues are ± (ħ/2), because the trace is zero and determinant is ( (ħ/2)^2 )( -n_z^2 -n_x^2 ) ) ?

Wait, no, the determinant would be (n_z)(-n_z) - (n_x)^2 → -n_z² -n_x² → -(n_x^2 +n_z^2 ). Since n is a unit vector, n_x² +n_z²=1. So det is -1. So the eigenvalues are sqrt(det^2 - trace^2 /4 ), but wait, the trace is zero, so eigenvalues are sqrt( ( -1 )) → ±1 multiplied by (ħ/2).

Wait, perhaps another approach: the eigenvectors for eigenvalue +1 of the matrix [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] can be found by solving:

(n_z - 1) a + n_x b =0

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0

Take the first equation:

(n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [n_x/(1 -n_z ) ] b.

But 1 -n_z is 1 - cosθ, as n_z is cosθ.

Wait, but in our previous calculation, we found a = cot(theta/2) *b, but now this is a = [n_x/(1-n_z)] b.

Since n_x is sinθ, and 1-n_z = 1 - cosθ.

So a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ ) ] b.

Which is the same as before, leading to a = cot(theta/2) b.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ ), 1 ]

Which, as we saw, normalizes to [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

So, the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Looking back at the options, option C is this. So the answer should be C.

But looking at the options again, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is exactly what we found.

So the correct option is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The direction $\vec{n}$ is expressed as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ in the x-z plane, where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$
The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]
Substituting the components of $\vec{n}$ and the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right)
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \lambda \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]
The eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation:
\[
\det\left(\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - \lambda & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - \lambda \end{bmatrix}\right) = 0
\]
Expanding:
\[
(\cos\theta - \lambda)(-\cos\theta - \lambda) - \sin^2\theta = 0
\]
\[
-\cos^2\theta + \lambda^2 - \sin^2\theta = 0
\]
\[
\lambda^2 = \cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta = 1
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are $\lambda = \pm 1$. For $\lambda = +1$, the eigenvector satisfies:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = 0
\]

### Step 3: Find the eigenvector
From the first equation:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0 \implies a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b
\]
Using trigonometric identities:
\[
1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2), \quad \sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)
\]
\[
\frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} = \cot(\theta/2)
\]
Thus:
\[
a = \cot(\theta/2) b
\]
The eigenvector is proportional to:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = b \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 4: Normalize the eigenvector
The normalization condition is:
\[
a^2 + b^2 = 1
\]
Substituting $a = \cot(\theta/2) b$:
\[
\cot^2(\theta/2) b^2 + b^2 = 1 \implies b^2 = \frac{1}{1 + \cot^2(\theta/2)} = \sin^2(\theta/2)
\]
\[
b = \sin(\theta/2), \quad a = \cos(\theta/2)
\]
Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 5: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ is not consistent with the normalized eigenvector derived.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ does not match the derived eigenvector.

### Final Answer:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.

**Answer: C**
