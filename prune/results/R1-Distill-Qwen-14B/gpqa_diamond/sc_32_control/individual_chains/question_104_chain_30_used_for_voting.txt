Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I need to figure out how the orbital periods of the two planets compare. Let me think about what I know.

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The RV method detected them, which measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull.

Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms (that's 5e-3 angstroms, right?), and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the radial velocity method depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period. But wait, no. The RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is given by a formula involving the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the mass of the star.

Oh right, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is something like:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * (1/(2π)) )^(1/1)

Wait, maybe I should write it more accurately. I think the formula is:

K = ( ( ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (P) / (2π) )^(1/3) ) ) ) / c

Wait no, perhaps a better approach is to think about the relationship between the semi-amplitude (K) and the orbital period (P).

Wait, I think the formula for K is:

K = (v * sin i) = ( ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (P) / (2π) )^(1/3) ) ) ) / c

Wait, perhaps the exact formula is a bit tricky, but since the stars have masses similar to the Sun and the planets are Neptune-like, which are much less massive, M_p << M_star. So M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the denominator can be simplified.

So the formula simplifies to:

K ≈ ( ( G * M_p ) / ( M_star ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P / (2π)) )^(1/3) ) / c

Wait, solving for K, let's think in terms of the formula. Alternatively, perhaps I can express K in terms of the planet's orbital period and mass.

Wait, another approach: the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (P)^(1/3) ) * c ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so:

K ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star^(2/3)) * (P)^(1/3) ) * c )

But wait, in this case, both planets are around stars of the same mass (solar masses), and the planets' masses are similar (Neptune-like, same mass). So M_p and M_star are the same for both planets. Also, assuming the same inclination (i) since the problem doesn't state otherwise. So sin i is the same for both, but I guess it's not given, so perhaps it's the same for both, so it factors out.

So, if I have two planets, planet 1 and planet 2, with K1 and K2 being their semi-amplitudes, then the ratio K2/K1 should be related to the ratio of their periods.

Let me write the ratio:

K2/K1 = [ ( M_p2 sin i2 ) / (P2^(1/3) ) ] / [ ( M_p1 sin i1 ) / (P1^(1/3) ) ]

But M_p1 = M_p2 (since both are Neptune-like), and I think the problem says the planets have masses similar to each other. So M_p is the same, sin i is probably the same (assuming same inclination, which isn't stated, but the question doesn't mention any difference, so we'll assume i is same for both. So M_p and sin i are the same, so they cancel out.

So K2/K1 = (1) / ( (P2 / P1)^(1/3) )

Wait, but K2 is larger than K1. Wait, no. Let me check:

Wait, K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, no, because the formula is K proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the formula correctly.

The correct formula for K is:

K = ( (v) ) = ( ( (27 * pi * G ) / (c^3 * P^2) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) )

But since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So:

K ≈ ( (27 pi G )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) / ( c * P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps another approach is better. Let me look for the relation between K and P.

Since both stars have the same mass, and the planets have same mass, the ratio of K2 to K1 is inversely proportional to (P2/P1)^(1/3). Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Because K is proportional to 1/(P)^(1/3). So if K2 is bigger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1, because K increases when P decreases.

Wait, no, in the question, K1 is 5 milliangstrom, K2 is 7. So K2 > K1.

So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4

But from the formula, since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then:

K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So 7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Wait, wait, no, earlier I thought K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)). So when K increases, P decreases.

So, if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 must be smaller than P1. So the ratio (P2/P1) is less than 1.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is smaller, the ratio would be less than 1, and the answer would be something like 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let's get back. Let me write the ratio:

K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3) → (7/5) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So cube both sides: (7/5)^3 = P1/P2 → (343/125) = P1/P2 → P2 = P1 * (125/343) → P2 = (125/343) P1

So the orbital period of planet #2 is (125/343) times that of planet #1.

Compute 125/343: 125 is 5³, 343 is 7³. So 5^3/7^3 = (5/7)^3. So 125/343 is approximately 0.3636... So P2 is approximately 0.36 times P1. So the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. That is P2/P1 = 0.36, meaning it's 0.36 times as long. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1 by a factor of about 0.36.

Wait, but the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So P2 is 0.36 * P1 → So P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times longer. So the ratio is 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I got the ratio right. Because sometimes mix up P1 and P2.

Wait, K2 is larger than K1. So the formula K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3) → 7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3) → cube both sides: 343/125 = P1/P2 → P2 = (125/343) P1 ≈ 0.3636 P1.

So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So it's shorter.

So the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1 → that would be P2/P1 = 0.36, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity method measures the semi-amplitude \( K \), which is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \) when the masses of the star and planet are similar. For two planets with the same mass and inclination, the ratio of their semi-amplitudes is given by:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{7}{5} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{7}{5}\right)^3 = \frac{P_1}{P_2}
\]

\[
\frac{343}{125} = \frac{P_1}{P_2}
\]

Rearranging for \( P_2 \):

\[
P_2 = P_1 \cdot \frac{125}{343}
\]

Simplifying \( \frac{125}{343} \), we find:

\[
P_2 \approx 0.36 \, P_1
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
