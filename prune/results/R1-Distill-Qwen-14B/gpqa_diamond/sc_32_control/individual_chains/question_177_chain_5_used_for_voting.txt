Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Hmm, let's read through it again and try to break it down.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, its mass is 1.5 times larger—wait, but the mass might not be directly relevant here since the question is about luminosity, which I think depends more on radius and temperature. Oh right, wait, the problem says the astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's the peak wavelength for each star based on blackbody radiation.

So, from what I remember, the peak wavelength of a star's emission is given by Wien's Law. Wien's Law states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature of the blackbody. The formula is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.898 × 10^-3 m·K). So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Oh, wait, but that can't be right because Star_1 is larger. Wait, no, the problem says the wavelengths they appear brightest are the same. So their temperatures are the same. Because same λ_max implies same T.

Wait, but how can that be if their sizes and masses are different? Oh, maybe because they're in different stages or something else is at play. Well, the problem says to assume they radiate as black bodies. So their luminosity can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So the problem is asking by what factor is Star_1's luminosity greater than Star_2's. We know R1 = 1.5 R2, T1 = T2 (because same λ_max), so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. Since T1 = T2, that term is 1. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the factor is 2.25, which is option A.

But wait, the options have more precise numbers. Hmm, the options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23. So 2.25 is exactly option A. But wait, did I miss something else?

Wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Oh wait, but how does radial velocity affect the observed wavelength? Oh! Because when a star is moving towards or away from us, there's a Doppler shift. The observed wavelength would shift, so the peak wavelength we observe might not be the same as their actual emitted peak.

But the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, the observed λ_max is the same for both. But each star's actual λ_max (emitted) could be different because of their velocities.

Wait, but wait. The question says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So that would be the observed wavelengths, which are affected by their velocities. So, the emitted wavelengths (λ_emit) might be different, but due to Doppler shift, the observed λ is same. So I need to account for the Doppler shift.

Hmm, so the observed wavelength λ_observed is λ_emit multiplied by a Doppler factor. The Doppler shift for light is given by the relativistic formula: λ_obs/λ_emit = sqrt( (1 + v_r / c) / (1 - v_r / c) ) ), where v_r is the radial velocity. Wait, but for small velocities, the approximation λ_obs = λ_emit (1 + v_r / c) is often used. But when velocities are significant compared to the speed of light, the relativistic effect is more accurate.

Wait, but let's think. Since Star_1 has v_r = 0, its observed λ is the same as its emitted λ. Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s. So for Star_2, λ_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), where v is 700e3 m/s. Wait, but the speed of light is approximately 3e5 km/s, so 700 km/s is about 0.00233c, which is small. So the Doppler shift might be approximated as (1 + v/c). But I'm not sure if the problem expects me to consider this or not.

Wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

But λ_obs is the Doppler-shifted version of the emitted λ_max. So we have:

λ_obs1 = λ1_emit * (1 + v1_r / c)  (since v1 is 0, this is just λ1_emit)
λ_obs2 = λ2_emit * (1 + v2_r / c)
And λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So, λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v2_r / c).

But according to Wien's law, λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So:

λ1_emit / λ2_emit = T2 / T1.

Because λ_max = b / T, so λ1_emit = b / T1, λ2_emit = b / T2. So their ratio is T2 / T1.

So from the Doppler effect, (λ1_emit) = (λ2_emit) * (1 + v2_r / c)

But (λ1_emit)/(λ2_emit) = T2/T1.

So (T2)/(T1) = (1 + v2_r / c)

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2_r / c)

Wait, but then since T2 is higher than T1 because v2 is moving away? Wait, v2 is 700 km/s radial velocity. If Star_2 is moving away, then the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted. So for Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ2_emit * (1 + v2_r / c). Since v2_r is positive (assuming moving away), so λ_obs2 is longer than λ2_emit. But Star_1 has λ_obs1 = λ1_emit.

So the problem says λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So, λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v2_r / c)

But from Wien's law, λ1_emit = b / T1, λ2_emit = b / T2. So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v2_r / c )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2_r / c )

So, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2_r / c )

So T2 is higher than T1 by a factor of (1 + v2_r / c )

Wait, but how does this affect the luminosity?

Because L = 4πR²σT⁴, so L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴ )

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.

And from earlier, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2_r / c )

So T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v2_r / c )

So (T1 / T2)^4 = 1 / (1 + v2_r / c )^4

So, L1/L2 = ( (1.5)^2 ) * [ 1 / (1 + v2_r / c )^4 ]

Because L1 is Star_1, so L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)^2 σ T1^4

and L2 =4π R2^2 σ T2^4

So L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 * T2^4 )

= (1.5^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= 2.25 * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

But T2 = T1 (1 + v2_r / c )

So T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v2_r/c )

So (T1/T2)^4 = 1/(1 + v2_r/c )^4

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * [ 1 / (1 + v2_r/c )^4 ]

Now, what is v2_r? It's 700 km/s. Let's compute v2_r / c.

v2_r = 700,000 m/s.

c ≈ 3e8 m/s.

v2_r / c = 700000 / 3e8 = 0.002333...

Approximately 0.002333.

So 1 + v2_r/c ≈ 1.002333.

So (1.002333)^4 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

First, 1.002333 to the power of 4. Let's compute it step by step.

(1 + x)^4, where x = 0.002333.

We can approximate (1+x)^4 ≈ 1 + 4x + 6x² + 4x³ + x⁴; but since x is small, maybe just up to x² or x³.

x = 0.002333.

x^2 = (0.002333)^2 ≈ 5.44e-6.

x^3= ~1.26e-8.

x^4 = ~3.1e-11.

So,

(1.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.002333) + 6*(5.44e-6) + 4*(1.26e-8) + 3.1e-11.

Calculating:

4*(0.002333) = 0.009332.

6 *5.44e-6 = 3.264e-5 ≈ 0.00003264.

The next terms are negligible.

So total ≈ 1 + 0.009332 + 0.00003264 = 1.00936464.

So approximately 1.00936.

So 1/(1.00936) ≈ 0.9907.

Wait no, L1/L2 = 2.25 * [1/(1.002333)^4 ].

Wait, (1.002333)^4 is about 1.00936.

So [1/(1.00936)] ≈ 0.9907.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907.

Let me compute that: 2.25 * 0.9907 = approximately 2.228.

Hmm, 2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

So approximately 2.228.

Looking at the options: A is ~2.25, D is ~2.23.

Wait, 2.228 is about 2.23, which is option D.

So earlier, without considering Doppler shift, I thought the answer was 2.25 (A), but considering the Doppler effect, it's about 2.23, so D.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of (1.002333)^4.

Let me compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator approach:

Compute (1.002333)^4.

Compute step by step:

First, 1.002333 squared:

(1.002333)^2 = (1 + 0.002333)^2 = 1 + 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.004666 + 0.00000544 ≈ 1.00467144.

Now, square that result for (1.002333)^4.

(1.00467144)^2 = (1 + 0.00467144)^2 = 1 + 2*0.00467144 + (0.00467144)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.00934288 + 0.000021825 ≈ 1.009364705.

So (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.009365.

So 1/(1.009365) ≈ 0.9907, as before.

So 2.25 * 0.9907 = 2.227875.

Which is approximately 2.228, which is about 2.23.

So the correct factor is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

So the initial approach without considering Doppler gives 2.25, but when considering the Doppler shift, it's about 2.23.

Therefore, the correct answer should be D.

To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(R\) is the radius, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The ratio of luminosities is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Relating Temperatures Using Wien's Law
The problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (\(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\)) are the same for both stars. From Wien's law, the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

where \(b\) is Wien's displacement constant. Since the observed wavelengths are the same, we must account for the Doppler shift. The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_r/c}{1 - v_r/c}}
\]

For Star_1, \(v_{r1} = 0\), so \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,1}}\). For Star_2, \(v_{r2} = 700 \, \text{km/s}\), so:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_{r2}/c}{1 - v_{r2}/c}}
\]

Since \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\), we equate the two:

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_{r2}/c}{1 - v_{r2}/c}}
\]

Using Wien's law (\(\lambda_{\text{emit}} \propto 1/T\)), we find:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_{r2}/c}{1 - v_{r2}/c}}
\]

### Step 2: Substituting Values
The radial velocity of Star_2 is \(v_{r2} = 700 \, \text{km/s}\), and the speed of light is \(c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\). Thus:

\[
\frac{v_{r2}}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]

The Doppler factor becomes:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{1 + v_{r2}/c}{1 - v_{r2}/c}} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + 0.002333}{1 - 0.002333}} \approx \sqrt{1.004666} \approx 1.002333
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} \approx 1.002333
\]

### Step 3: Calculating the Luminosity Ratio
The radius of Star_1 is \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\), so:

\[
\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

The temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.002333}
\]

Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{1}{1.002333}\right)^4
\]

Approximating \((1.002333)^4\):

\[
(1.002333)^4 \approx 1 + 4(0.002333) + 6(0.002333)^2 + \dots \approx 1.00936
\]

So:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx \frac{1}{1.00936} \approx 0.9907
\]

Finally, the luminosity ratio is:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times 0.9907 \approx 2.228
\]

### Step 4: Comparing with Options
The calculated factor is approximately \(2.23\), which corresponds to option **D**.
