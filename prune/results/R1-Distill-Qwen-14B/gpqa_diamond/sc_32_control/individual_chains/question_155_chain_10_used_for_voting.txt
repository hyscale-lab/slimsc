Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of operators and uncertainties. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(<P_z²> - <P_z>²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared for the given state.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (−1/2, 1/√2, −1/2). Wait, but I should confirm if this vector is normalized. Let me calculate the sum of the squares of its components.

Let's see: (-1/2)^2 is 1/4, (1/√2)^2 is 1/2, and (-1/2)^2 is another 1/4. Adding them up: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25) = 1. Okay, so the vector is normalized. Good, that's a relief.

Now, I need to compute <P_z> and <P_z²> for this state.

First, let me write down the matrix for P_z. The problem states that P_z has a matrix form where the first row is (ħ, 0, 0), the second row is (0, 0, 0), and the third row is (0,0,−ħ). So P_z is a diagonal matrix:

P_z = [ [ħ, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, -ħ] ]

Wait, so each diagonal element corresponds to the eigenvalues for the basis vectors. Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. That should make things easier because when calculating <P_z>, it's just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues.

But wait, the state given is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So it's a superposition of the P_z eigenstates. So I can't directly say that it's one of the basis vectors; I need to compute the expectation values.

To find <P_z>, I need to compute the expectation value of the operator P_z in the given state. Since the state is represented as a column vector |ψ>, <P_z> is ψ† P_z ψ.

Similarly, <P_z²> is ψ† P_z^2 ψ.

Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just each diagonal element squared. So for P_z, the diagonal elements are ħ, 0, -ħ. So P_z² would have diagonal elements (ħ², 0, ħ²).

Let me write down the state vector ψ as a column:

ψ = [ -1/2,
        1/√2,
        -1/2 ]

So, let's compute <P_z> first.

The formula is ψ† P_z ψ. So I'll multiply the vector ψ with P_z and then take the inner product with ψ.

Alternatively, for a diagonal matrix, the expectation value is the sum of |ψ_i|^2 multiplied by the diagonal element at position i.

Wait, right! Because if each basis vector is an eigenstate of P_z, then the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities (|c_i|^2) multiplied by their eigenvalues.

So the state ψ is a combination of the eigenstates of P_z, which are the basis vectors here. So ψ is a linear combination of |e1>, |e2>, |e3>, where |e1> is (1,0,0), |e2> is (0,1,0), |e3> is (0,0,1).

So, the coefficients are c1 = -1/2, c2 = 1/√2, c3 = -1/2.

So, <P_z> = |c1|^2 * (eigenvalue e1) + |c2|^2 * (eigenvalue e2) + |c3|^2 * (eigenvalue e3).

Wait, but wait. The eigenvalues of P_z are in the diagonal. So for each basis vector |e1>, P_z |e1> = ħ |e1>, so the eigenvalue is ħ for e1. Similarly, e2 has eigenvalue 0, and e3 has eigenvalue -ħ.

So, let's compute |c1|^2, |c2|^2, |c3|^2.

|c1|² = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4.

|c2|² = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

|c3|² = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4.

So, <P_z> = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) 

= (1/4 ħ) - (1/4 ħ) 

= 0.

Hmm, that's interesting. The expectation value of P_z is zero.

Now, I need to compute <P_z^2>. Since P_z is diagonal, the square is straightforward.

The eigenvalues for P_z^2 are just each eigenvalue squared. So for e1, it's ħ², e2 is 0, e3 is ħ² again.

So, <P_z²> = |c1|^2 * (ħ²) + |c2|^2 * 0 + |c3|^2 * ħ² 

= (1/4) * ħ² + (1/4) * ħ²

= (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² 

= (1/2) ħ².

So, <P_z^2> = (ħ²)/2.

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of (<P_z^2> - <P_z>^2). Since <P_z> is zero, ΔP_z is sqrt( (ħ²/2) - 0 ) = (ħ)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which would be the correct answer.

Wait a minute, but let me double-check my calculations. Did I make any mistake?

Let me recap:

- The state vector components: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Norm is 1, correct.

- The basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, so the state is expressed as a linear combination of |e1>, |e2>, |e3>.

- <P_z> is sum |ci|^2 * eigenvalue.

- For the eigenvalue of e1: ħ. |c1|² is 1/4. So contribution is (1/4) ħ.

- Eigenvalue of e2 is 0, so contribution is (1/2)*0=0.

- Eigenvalue of e3 is -ħ. |c3|² is 1/4. So contribution is (1/4)*(-ħ).

Adding: (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0. So <P_z> is zero.

For <P_z^2>, the eigenvalues are ħ², 0, ħ².

Summing |ci|² * (eigenvalue squared):

(1/4) * ħ² + (1/2) * 0 + (1/4) * ħ² = (1/4 +1/4) ħ² = 1/2 ħ².

So the variance is 1/2 ħ², so sqrt is (ħ)/sqrt(2).

So the uncertainty is ħ/sqrt(2). Which is option B.

Wait, but let me think if there's another way to compute this, perhaps using the matrix multiplication. Let me try that approach to confirm.

The expectation value <P_z> is ψ† P_z ψ.

So ψ is a column vector:

ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T

P_z is [[ħ,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,-ħ]]

So P_z ψ is:

First element: ħ*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) = ħ*(-1/2)
Second element: 0*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) = 0
Third element: 0*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + (-ħ)*(-1/2) = (ħ/2)

So P_z ψ is [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T.

Now, ψ† is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]

So ψ† (P_z ψ) is (-1/2)(-ħ/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(ħ/2) 

= (ħ/4) + 0 + (-ħ/4) 

= 0.

Which matches our earlier calculation. So <P_z> is indeed zero.

Now, <P_z^2> is ψ† P_z^2 ψ.

But P_z^2 is [[(ħ)^2, 0, 0],[0, 0, 0],[0,0, (−ħ)^2]] = [[ħ²,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0, ħ²]]

So P_z^2 ψ is:

First element: ħ²*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) = - ħ²/2
Second element: 0
Third element: 0*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + ħ²*(-1/2) = - ħ²/2

So P_z^2 ψ is [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ]^T.

Now, ψ† multiplied by this gives:

(-1/2)*(-ħ²/2) + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*(-ħ²/2)

= (ħ²/4) + 0 + (ħ²/4) 

= ħ²/2.

Which again confirms that <P_z^2> is ħ²/2.

So the uncertainty is sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

Wait a second, but I thought that for the expectation of P_z, since it's zero, the uncertainty would be based solely on the spread in the P_z eigenstates. The state is a combination of e1 and e3 (since their coefficients are non-zero), so the possible outcomes are ħ and -ħ. The probabilities for each are 1/4 and 1/4, and for e2 it's 1/2, but e2's eigenvalue is zero.

So the possible outcomes are either ħ (with probability 1/4) or -ħ (with probability 1/4). The variance would be E[X²] - (E[X})², which is ( (1/4)(ħ²) + (1/4)(ħ²) ) ) - 0 = (1/2 ħ²). So the standard deviation is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = ħ/sqrt(2), same as before.

So yeah, the correct answer is option B: ħ/sqrt(2).

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the state given by the column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The operator $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi.
\]

Since $P_z$ is diagonal, this simplifies to:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |c_1|^2 \cdot \hbar + |c_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |c_3|^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where $c_1 = -\frac{1}{2}$, $c_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, and $c_3 = -\frac{1}{2}$. The probabilities are:

\[
|c_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, which is also diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |c_1|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |c_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |c_3|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$. Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**B) $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$.**
