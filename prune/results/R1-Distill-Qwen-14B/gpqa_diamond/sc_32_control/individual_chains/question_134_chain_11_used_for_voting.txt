Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem states that we have three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. They're all mixed together, and I need to find the enthalpy of neutralization. The options are given in kcal and kJ, so I should be careful about the units.

Wait, I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization is typically the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard value is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases. But this might vary based on the specific substances involved.

Let me start by figuring out how much H+ and OH- ions are present in each solution. Because HCl is a strong acid, it will dissociate completely, giving H+ ions. Similarly, H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, it's a diprotic acid. So in solution, it should dissociate into 2 H+ per molecule. But wait, I'm mixing H2SO4 with Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Ba(OH)2 will dissociate into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions.

Wait a second, so when H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 are mixed, what's the reaction? H2SO4 is H+ and SO4^2- ions. Ba(OH)2 is Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So, the acid and base will react to produce water and a salt.

But wait, the problem is about neutralization. So I need to find the moles of H+ and OH- ions from each solution and see which is in excess.

Let me calculate moles for each acid and base.

First, HCl: it's a monoprotic acid, so each mole gives one mole of H+.

Moles of HCl = Molarity * Volume (in liters)
HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 mol.

Next, H2SO4: it's a diprotic acid, so each mole gives 2 moles of H+.

Molarity is 0.3 M, volume is 0.3 L. So moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Therefore, H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, Ba(OH)2: each mole gives 2 moles of OH-.

Molarity is 0.5 M, volume is 0.2 L. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

So total H+ available: from HCl and H2SO4 is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- available: 0.2 moles.

Now, which one is in excess? H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent. All the OH- will react, and there will be some H+ left over.

The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. Each mole of H+ and OH- produces one mole of water, releasing heat (exothermic).

So the moles of H+ that react will be equal to the moles of OH-, which is 0.2 moles. So 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH- will react.

The excess H+ would be 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles, but since that's unreacted, it doesn't contribute to the enthalpy of neutralization. So the reaction's based on the limiting reagent.

Now, the enthalpy change for neutralization. For each mole of H+ and OH- reacting, the enthalpy is approximately -57 kJ (or about -28.4 kcal, since 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ). Wait, what's the exact value? I remember that the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is about -57 kJ/mol, but sometimes it's expressed as -28.4 kcal/mol because each mole produces one mole of water.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, each mole of H+ and OH- reacting produces one mole of water. So the enthalpy is per mole of H+ reacted. So if 0.2 moles of H+ react, the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ. Or is it that each mole of H+ gives -28.4 kcal? Let me make sure.

Wait, 1 cal is about 4.184 J. 1 kcal is 4184 J, which is 4.184 kJ. So 57 kJ is about 13.63 kcal. Wait, no, wait. 1 kJ is 239.006 cal, so 57 kJ is 57 * 239.006 cal ≈ 13,623 cal, which is 13.623 kcal. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the standard enthalpy is -57 kJ per mole of H2O formed. Since each mole of H+ and OH- makes a mole of H2O, that would mean each mole of H+ gives -57 kJ.

Wait, no, wait. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is the heat when 1 mole of H+ from an acid reacts with 1 mole of OH- from a base to form 1 mole of water. So the value is indeed about -57 kJ per mole of H+.

So in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ react, so the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but let me check the options. The options are:

A) -2.72 kcal
B) -11.42 kcal
C) -3.80 kcal
D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, option B is -11.42 kcal. Let me convert the -11.4 kJ I calculated into kcal to see if it matches. Since 1 kJ is approximately 0.239 kcal (because 1 kcal = 4184 J, and 1 kJ is 1000 J; so 1000 /4184 ≈ 0.239 kcal).

So 11.4 kJ = 11.4 * 0.239 = approximately 2.72 kcal. Wait, but that can't be right because 0.2 moles times 57 kJ is 11.4 kJ. So 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal? Wait no, wait, wait. Wait, no, no, wait. I think I'm getting confused between kJ and kcal. Let me clarify.

Wait, 1 kcal is 4184 J. 1 kJ is 1000 J. So 1 kJ is about 0.239 kcal.

So 11.4 kJ = 11.4 * 0.239 ≈ 2.72 kcal. Wait, that would make the enthalpy change -2.72 kcal. Which matches option A.

But wait, that can't be right because we have 0.2 moles reacting. If each mole gives -57 kJ, which is about -13.6 kcal (since 57 / 4.184 ≈ 13.6 kcal). Because 1 kJ is about 0.239 kcal, so 57 kJ is 57 * 0.239 ≈ 13.623 kcal. So 0.2 moles would give 0.2 * (-13.623 kcal) = -2.7246 kcal. So that's about -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but why then option B is -11.42 kcal? Because 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal. So the correct answer in kcal would be -2.72, which is option A. But wait, wait another point: the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of reaction. So if the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and each mole gives off -57 kJ or -13.6 kcal. So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * (-13.6) = -2.72 kcal. So yes, option A is correct.

But wait, the problem is about mixing these solutions. Does the enthalpy of neutralization account for all the H+ and OH- reacting, or just the stoichiometric amount? Because in this case, not all H+ is reacting; only the OH- is consumed.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the total H+ and OH- and see which is limiting.

Wait, let me go through the calculation again.

HCl: 500 mL * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL * 0.5 M = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH- (since each gives 2 OH-).

Total H+ is 0.28 mol; OH- is 0.2 mol. So OH- is the limiting reagent. So 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH- will react.

Therefore, the moles of H+ that react are 0.2 moles.

So enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options include -11.42 kcal and -16 kJ. Hmm, perhaps I messed up the unit conversion.

Wait, 57 kJ is per mole. So 0.2 mol gives 11.4 kJ. 11.4 kJ is how many kcal? Since 1 kJ = 0.239 kcal, 11.4 * 0.239 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, another thought: when mixing H2SO4 (a diprotic acid) and a base, the first H+ is more strong and dissociates completely, and the second H+ might not. But since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, I think all the OH- would react with the available H+ from the acids.

Wait, but H2SO4 is a strong acid, so in solution, it would dissociate completely into 2 H+ and SO4^2- ions. So the H+ from H2SO4 is definitely available for reaction.

So the earlier calculation holds: 0.28 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-.

So 0.2 mol of H+ and OH- react, giving 0.2 mol H2O, releasing 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. Since it's exothermic, it's -11.4 kJ. But the options have a B) -11.42 kcal and D) -16.0 kJ.

Wait, but 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal. So why is option B at -11.42 kcal? That's larger in magnitude than my 11.4 kJ. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the total moles of H+ from all sources, but that can't be. Because the OH- is the limiting reagent, only 0.2 mol H+ reacts.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and see which is in excess. Oh wait, yes, that's what I did.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the enthalpy per mole of reaction, but perhaps I'm miscalculating the moles.

Wait, let's recalculate the moles.

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L; 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L; 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL = 0.2 L; 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Available OH-: 0.2 mol.

So, all OH- will react, leaving 0.08 mol H+ unreacted. So 0.2 mol of H+ and OH- react, producing 0.2 mol H2O. Each mole of H2O releases 57 kJ, so 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher in magnitude. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72). So the correct answer in kcal would be about -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization of both H+ from H2SO4 and HCl with OH-.

Wait, another approach: perhaps considering the stoichiometry of the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so it can donate 2 H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, providing 2 OH- ions per formula unit.

So when they react, the reaction would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Wait, the balanced equation would be H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4↓ + 2 H2O.

So each mole of H2SO4 reacts with 1 mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce 2 moles of H2O.

So let's calculate the moles of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol.

So the mole ratio is 0.09 : 0.1. The stoichiometric ratio is 1:1, so H2SO4 is the limiting reagent here. So all 0.09 mol of H2SO4 will react with 0.09 mol of Ba(OH)2 to produce 0.18 mol of H2O.

But wait, wait. Because each mole of H2SO4 produces 2 H+ and each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces 2 OH-, the reaction would involve 2 H+ + 2 OH- → 2 H2O, which comes from 1 H2SO4 and 1 Ba(OH)2.

So in this reaction, each mole of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 produces 2 moles of H2O. So 0.09 moles of H2SO4 would react with 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, producing 0.18 moles of H2O.

Wait, but wait, the HCl is another acid, contributing H+.

So when the three solutions are mixed, all H+ from HCl and H2SO4 will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but wait, let's model the reaction correctly. The H+ from HCl and H2SO4 will react with the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So the total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 mol.

The OH- available is 0.2 mol. So 0.2 mol of H+ will react, leaving 0.08 mol H+ unreacted.

So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, releasing 57 kJ per mole.

So the total enthalpy change is 0.2 mol * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ. So that's -11,400 J.

Now, looking back at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is more than what I calculated. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Let's see what 11.4 kJ is in kcal.

Wait, 1 kJ is 1000 J, and 1 kcal is 4184 J. So 1 kJ = 1000/4184 kcal ≈ 0.239 kcal.

So 11.4 kJ is 11.4 * 0.239 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, another confusion point: sometimes the enthalpy of neutralization is given per mole of H+ or per mole of H2O. Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ reacting. So if 0.2 moles of H+ react, it's 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, or about -2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer should be option A (-2.72 kcal).

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the stoichiometric calculations. Let me check again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is expressed per mole of acid or base, but that's not the case. It's per mole of H+ or OH- reacting.

Hmm. So yes, the calculation seems correct. The answer should be option A: -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Which is about the same as the 11.4 kJ I calculated earlier. Which would be if the enthalpy is given in kcal as 11.42, which is about 11.4 kJ. But wait, no, that can't be right because 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal, not 11.42.

Wait a second, perhaps the question is asking for the enthalpy in kilocalories, not kilojoules. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem asks for the enthalpy of neutralization when these solutions are mixed. The enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal. So option A is correct.

So the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So the correct answer is A, because -2.72 kcal is approximately -11.4 kJ, which matches the calculation.

Wait, but wait, another point. The problem says 'enthalpy of neutralization', which is usually the enthalpy change when one mole of acid reacts with one mole of base. But in this case, there are three solutions, so perhaps the way they're mixing complicates things. But I think the initial approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutralization reaction should consider all the H+ and OH- and which is in excess. But that's exactly what I did.

So I think the correct answer is option B, but now I'm confused because my calculations lead me to option A.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization of the H2SO4 with Ba(OH)2, and then the HCl with the remaining OH-.

Wait, let's model that.

Ba(OH)2 has 0.2 mol of OH-. H2SO4 has 0.18 mol of H+ (since each mole gives 2 H+). So H2SO4 can donate 0.18 mol H+.

So the Ba(OH)2's OH- will first react with H+ from H2SO4.

Each OH- neutralizes one H+.

So 0.18 mol H+ (from H2SO4) reacts with 0.18 mol OH- (from Ba(OH)2), producing 0.18 mol H2O. The remaining OH- is 0.2 - 0.18 = 0.02 mol.

Then, the remaining OH- (0.02 mol) will react with H+ from HCl.

HCl provides 0.1 mol H+. So 0.02 mol OH- reacts with 0.02 mol H+ from HCl, producing 0.02 mol H2O.

So total moles of H+ reacted: 0.18 (from H2SO4) + 0.02 (from HCl) = 0.2 mol. So same as before.

So the total enthalpy change is 0.2 mol * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal.

So yes, the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we first determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions available:

1. **HCl (strong acid):**  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Since HCl dissociates completely, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

2. **H₂SO₄ (strong acid, diprotic):**  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of H₂SO₄ dissociates into 2 moles of H⁺, so it contributes \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

3. **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 moles of OH⁻, so it contributes \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

### Reaction and Limiting Reagent:
The neutralization reaction is:  
\[
\text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O}
\]  
The total moles of H⁺ available are \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \), and the total moles of OH⁻ available are \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
Since OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, only \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ and OH⁻ will react, producing \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}_2\text{O} \).

### Enthalpy of Neutralization:
The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol} \) for each mole of H⁺ and OH⁻ reacting.  
For \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of reaction:  
\[
\Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}
\]  
Converting to kcal:  
\[
1 \, \text{kJ} = 0.239 \, \text{kcal}, \quad -11.4 \, \text{kJ} = -11.4 \times 0.239 = -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **A) -2.72 kcal:** Matches the calculated value.  
- **B) -11.42 kcal:** Incorrect, as this corresponds to \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \) misinterpreted as kcal.  
- **C) -3.80 kcal:** Incorrect, as it does not match any part of the calculation.  
- **D) -16.0 kJ:** Incorrect, as the calculated value is \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \), not \( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \).

### Final Answer:
The correct answer is **A) -2.72 kcal**.  
Answer: A
