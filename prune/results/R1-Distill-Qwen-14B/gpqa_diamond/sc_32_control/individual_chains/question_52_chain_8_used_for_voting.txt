Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, and its radius is 1.5 solar radii, mass is 1.1 solar masses. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Hmm, so the spots are making the star cooler overall.

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots.

Wait, the ratio is level 1 to level 2. So when the star has spots, this ratio is lower. So the factor would be (ratio without spots)/(ratio with spots) = ?

I remember from my studies that in stellar atmospheres under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the number of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations is given by (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

Here, E_i is the energy of level i, E_j for level j. So if E_2 is higher than E_1, then the ratio n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, but the problem says when spots are present (lower T), the ratio decreases. So when T is lower, the ratio n1/n2 is lower. Let me think about that.

Let me denote the ratio R = n1/n2. Without spots, T is higher, R is higher. But when spots are present, the overall T is lower, so R is lower.

The problem says when the star has spots, the ratio R decreases. So the ratio is lower in spots case. So the factor we're to find is R_without_spots / R_with_spots.

The transition is between two specific energy levels, and the wavelength is given as 1448 Å. I think the energy difference between the two levels relates to the wavelength because E = hc/λ. So E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

But for the ratio, I think I can express the ratio in terms of the temperatures. Let me write the Boltzmann equation for both cases.

Without spots: R0 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T0) )

With spots: R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T1) )

The ratio R0/R1 would then be [exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T0) ) ] / [exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T0) )

Wait, let me compute that exponent. Let me calculate the term (1/T1 - 1/T0). T0 is 6000 K, T1 is 5500 K.

So 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818 K^-1, 1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667 K^-1. The difference is about 0.000015151 K^-1.

So the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) → but wait, the difference is 1/T1 - 1/T0 = 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151 K^-1.

Wait, no, actually 1/T1 is 1/5500, 1/T0 is 1/6000. So 1/T1 is larger than 1/T0 because T1 is smaller than T0. So 1/T1 - 1/T0 is positive.

Wait, in the exponent, it's (E2-E1)/(k) multiplied by (1/T1 - 1/T0). So the exponent is positive because (1/T1 -1/T0) is positive, and (E2-E1) is positive. So exp( positive number ), so the ratio R0/R1 is greater than 1, which makes sense because R0 is higher when T is higher.

So the factor is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T0) )

Now, substituting E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

Let me compute this.

E = hc/λ. Let's compute the value of (E)/(k), which is (hc)/(λ k).

h is Planck's constant, around 6.626e-34 J s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38e-23 J/K.

So,

E/k = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10 * 1.38e-23)

Let me compute each part.

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Denominator: 1448e-10 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1448e-10 * 1.38e-23 = let's compute that.

1448e-10 = 1.448e-7 m.

1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 = (1.448 *1.38) * 1e-30 = about 1.988e-30 J·m·K^{-1} ?

Wait, no, let me compute it properly.

Wait, the units for E/k would be J/(J/K) = K, so E/k has units of Kelvin. That makes sense because when we have (E)/(k T), it's dimensionless.

Wait, wait, no. E is in Joules, k is J/K, so E/k has units of K. So when we compute (E/k) * (1/T1 - 1/T0), which is (K) * (1/K) → dimensionless, that's correct for the exponent.

So, computation:

E/(k) = (h c) / (λ k) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10 * 1.38e-23)

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1448e-10 * 1.38e-23 = 1448 * 1.38e-33 = let's compute 1448*1.38.

1448 * 1.38 = let's see: 1448 * 1 =1448; 1448 * 0.38 = 549. So total about 1448 + 549 = 2000? Let me compute more accurately.

1448 * 1.38:

1448 * 1 = 1448.

1448 * 0.3 = 434.4.

1448 * 0.08 = 115.84.

So 1448 + 434.4 = 1882.4; 1882.4 +115.84= 1998.24.

So denominator is 1998.24e-33 → approximately 1.998e-30 J·m·K^{-1}.

Wait, no, actually, denominator is 1448e-10 m multiplied by 1.38e-23 J/K.

So 1448e-10 = 1.448e-7 m.

Multiply by 1.38e-23 → 1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 = (1.448 *1.38) * 1e-30 → approximately 1.988e-30 (since 1.448 *1.38 is about 1.998, as before).

So denominator is approximately 1.998e-30.

So E/k = (1.9878e-25) / (1.998e-30) → approximately (2e-25)/(2e-30) )= 1e5 → 100,000 K.

Wait, let me compute 1.9878e-25 / 1.998e-30 = (1.9878 / 1.998) * (1e-25 / 1e-30) )= approx (0.995) * 1e5 = 99,500 K.

So E/k ≈ ~1e5 K.

Now, the term (1/T1 -1/T0) is (1/5500 - 1/6000) K^{-1}.

Compute that:

1/5500 = approx 0.000181818.

1/6000 = 0.000166667.

Subtracting: 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151 K^{-1}.

So (E/k) * (1/T1 -1/T0) = 1e5 K * 0.000015151 K^{-1} → 1e5 * 0.000015151 = 1.5151.

So the exponent is approximately 1.515.

So the ratio R0/R1 = exp(1.515).

What's exp(1.515)? Let me think. I remember that exp(1) is about 2.718, exp(2) is about 7.389, exp(0.7) is about 2.013.

Wait, 1.515 is approximately 1.5. So exp(1.5) is around 4.48.

Wait, wait, let me compute more accurately. Let me use a calculator approach.

We can use the Taylor series or approximate values. Alternatively, I know that ln(5) is about 1.609, so ln(4.48) would be around 1.5.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Let me think: 1.515 is approximately 1.5. Let's compute e^1.5.

e^1.5 = e^(1 + 0.5) = e * sqrt(e) ≈ 2.71828 * 1.64872 ≈ 4.4817.

So approximately 4.48.

Wait, but wait, the exponent is 1.515, which is a bit more than 1.5. So e^1.515 would be a bit higher than 4.48.

Let me compute the difference. The derivative of e^x is e^x, so the approximate change for a small delta x is delta x * e^x.

At x=1.5, e^x =4.4817. The delta x is 0.015. So delta ≈ 0.015 *4.4817 ≈ 0.0672.

So e^1.515 ≈ 4.4817 + 0.0672 ≈ 4.5489.

So around 4.55.

Wait, but wait, I'm approximating. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator, but I don't have one. So perhaps the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So that would be the answer.

But wait, let me double-check my steps because sometimes factors can be tricky.

Wait, another possibility: when the star has spots, the overall temperature is lower, so perhaps I should consider the temperature as the average or something else. But the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So the entire photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K in that case.

So the effective temperature is the temperature that would give the same luminosity as the star if it were a blackbody. So the effective temperature is a kind of average, so when the star has spots, the overall T_eff is 5500 K, which is lower than 6000 K.

So the ratio R is (n1/n2) which depends on the local temperature. But wait, when some regions are cooler (spots) and others are at T0, how does that affect the overall ratio?

Wait, wait a minute. The problem says that when the star's surface is not covered by spots, its Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K.

But the question is about the ratio in the photosphere when the star has spots. Are the spots cooler, so the emission from the spots is from a lower temperature. But the photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So when evaluating the ratio, are we to take the average T, or does the ratio depend on the local T?

Wait, the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, so each region is in LTE. So if 40% of the surface is covered by spots at some lower temperature, say T_spot, and the rest is at T_no_spot, but the effective temperature is 5500 K.

Hmm, but that complicates things because the star isn't isothermal anymore. So perhaps the problem is assuming that when the spots are present, the entire photosphere is at 5500 K? Because the question says that when the surface is covered, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. Or maybe the spots are at a lower temperature, but the rest is at 6000 K. Hmm, but that complicates the analysis.

Wait, the question says when the surface is not covered by spots, T_eff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall T_eff is 5500 K. So the star is a mix of two temperatures: the non-spots at 6000 K and spots at a lower temperature, say T_spot. The overall T_eff is a blackbody average based on the area coverage.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels decreases. So that suggests that the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K, so perhaps the question is considering the star as being at 5500 K when the spots are present, and 6000 K when not.

Wait, but that's an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps the spots are much cooler, but when the majority of the surface is at 6000 K, the effective temperature is 6000 K. When 40% is covered by lower temperature spots, the effective temperature drops to 5500 K.

But the problem is about the photospheric conditions. So when spots are present, the photosphere is a mix of 60% at 6000 K and 40% at T_spot.

But the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels in the photosphere. So how does the presence of spots affect the ratio?

Wait, this complicates things because the photosphere is no longer isothermal. So the Boltzmann equation would apply locally, but the overall ratio would depend on the contributions from each region.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying and treating the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K otherwise. Because the question says, "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K."

So perhaps, we can model each case as the star having a uniform temperature of 6000 K without spots, and 5500 K with spots.

If that's the case, then the earlier approach holds. The ratio R0/R1 would be exp( (E/k) (1/T1 - 1/T0) )

Earlier calculation gave this factor as approximately 4.55, which would point to option C.

But wait, another thought: the energy levels' ratio depends on the temperature. So if the photosphere is a mix of two temperatures, the overall ratio would be a weighted average of the ratios from each region.

But that's more complicated. Let me think. Suppose the star has two regions: 60% at T1=6000 K and 40% at T_spot (which I don't know, but perhaps the problem isn't addressing this). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply treating the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K otherwise.

Wait, the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K? Or perhaps the spots are at a lower temperature, but the rest is at 6000 K, and the overall T_eff is 5500 K. But in that case, the photospheric conditions are a mix of 6000 K and lower temperatures, so the ratio would be a combination of the two.

Wait, but the problem says that when the surface is not covered by spots, the Teff is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered, Teff drops to 5500 K.

So the Teff is the effective temperature, which is the temperature of a blackbody with the same total luminosity as the star. So the star's luminosity when 40% is covered would be lower because 40% of the area emits at a lower temperature.

But the question is about the photospheric conditions in each case. When spots are present, the photosphere is a mix of spots (lower T) and non-spots (higher T). So the ratio of Ti atoms would be a combination of the two regions.

Hmm, this makes the problem more complex. Let me think about how to model this.

Suppose that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, which are at a much lower temperature T_spot, and the remaining 60% is at T0=6000 K. The effective temperature is 5500 K.

But the problem is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. Since the photosphere is no longer isothermal, the ratio would be a combination of the two regions.

But the problem says, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels... decreases when the star has spots." So the overall ratio is lower when spots are present.

So perhaps the question is implying that the star, as a whole, is at a lower effective temperature when spots are present, and thus the ratio is lower. So perhaps each region contributes to the observed ratio, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying, and treating the entire photosphere as at the effective temperature. But that might not be physically accurate, but perhaps the problem is structured that way.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with the initial approach, which gives a factor of approximately 4.5, which is option C.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculation. The exponent was (E/k) * (1/T1 -1/T0) = 1e5 K * (0.000015151 K^-1) = 1.515.

Wait, 1e5 * 0.000015151 is 1.5151.

So exp(1.5151) is approximately 4.54, as I thought earlier.

So the factor is about 4.5, which is option C.

The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when a star transitions from having no spots (effective temperature \( T_0 = 6000 \, \text{K} \)) to having spots (effective temperature \( T_1 = 5500 \, \text{K} \)). The ratio of populations in two energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \), and \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant. The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\frac{R_0}{R_1} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_0}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \)
The energy difference is \( E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). Substituting these values:

\[
E_2 - E_1 = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} = 1.348 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

The ratio \( \frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \) is then:

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} = \frac{1.348 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} = 9775 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_0} \)
The effective temperatures are \( T_0 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_1 = 5500 \, \text{K} \). The difference is:

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_0} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.0000151 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the exponent
The exponent is:

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_0}\right) = (9775)(0.0000151) = 0.1477.
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( \frac{R_0}{R_1} \)
The factor is:

\[
\frac{R_0}{R_1} = \exp(0.1477) \approx 1.16.
\]

This result indicates that the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in the two energy levels increases by a factor of approximately 1.16 when the star transitions from having spots to not having spots.

### Final Answer:
The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately **1.1**, corresponding to option **A**.

Answer: A
