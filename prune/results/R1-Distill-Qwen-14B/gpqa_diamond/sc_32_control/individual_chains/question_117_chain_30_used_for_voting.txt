Okay, so today I have this organic chemistry question to tackle. It's about optical isomerism, which I remember has something to do with molecules that can rotate plane-polarized light. Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. So, the presence of such centers would make the molecule chiral, leading to optical activity.

The question gives me four organic moieties and asks which of them show optical isomerism. The options are multiple-choice, so I need to evaluate each of the four compounds one by one.

Let me go through each one step by step.

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
   Hmm, this sounds a bit complex. Let's break it down. It's a biphenyl compound, meaning two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 6 and 2 on each ring. The groups are nitro (NO2) and ester groups (COOCH3). The structure is 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, but the ester groups are on each benzene ring at position 2. Are these positions such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry?

   Biphenyls can have different conformations, but in this case, the substituents are at positions that are symmetric. Let me imagine the structure: each benzene has a nitro group at position 6 and a carbonyl group (ester) at position 2. So, if each benzene is substituted in a mirror-like fashion, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Wait, but since it's biphenyl, the rotation about the central bond can lead to different configurations. Oh, but wait, this is about constitutional isomerism? No, this is about optical isomerism. Oh, right, optical isomerism is about stereoisomerism due to chiral centers or other forms like geometric isomerism.

   Alternatively, maybe this molecule has a structure where the substituents are arranged in a way that leads to a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe it's about the biphenyl's ability to have enantiomers. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Wait, biphenyls can have axial chirality, which is a type of stereoisomerism where the two rings are connected in a way that the configuration around the central bond can lead to different enantiomers. For this to happen, the substituents on each ring must be in such a way that the central bond's rotation leads to non-superimposable mirror images.

   So in this case, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carbonyl (ester) at 2. So, the substituents on each ring are in specific positions. Are they arranged symmetrically? Let me think. If the two rings are connected, and each has a nitro and ester group in the same relative positions, would that create a situation where the molecule is chiral? Alternatively, maybe the presence of two ester groups (on each benzene) and two nitro groups (on each) creates asymmetry.

   Wait, but biphenyls can exhibit axial chirality only if the substituents on each ring are not all in the same plane, leading to a lack of a plane of symmetry. For instance, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that don't mirror each other. So, if each ring has substituents that are opposite, then maybe there's a plane of symmetry. But if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the overall molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral.

   Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule as a whole is symmetric. Let's see: each benzene has a nitro and ester group. Are these substituents mirroring each other across the central bond? If the substituents on each ring are in positions that are mirror images, the whole molecule could have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

   Wait, the substituents are at positions 6 and 2 on each ring. So, on one ring, the nitro is at position 6, and the ester at 2. On the other ring, the nitro is at 6' and the ester at 2'. So, considering the positions relative to each other, maybe the substituents are arranged symmetrically across the central bond. Like, the nitro on one ring's 6 is across from the nitro on the other ring's 6', and the ester on 2 is across from the ester on 2'. So perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement allows for two different enantiomers.

   Alternatively, if the substituents are at positions that create a chiral center somewhere else. Wait, the question is about moieties showing optical isomerism. So, perhaps this compound has a chiral center. Let me think about the core. Each benzene is attached to the central bond, and each has substituents. Are any of the carbons attached to four different groups?

   No, because each ring is connected via the central bond, but the substituents are on the benzene rings. Benzene is sp2 hybridized, so the carbons attached to substituents are not chiral centers. So perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. But wait, biphenyls can have axial chirality, which is a different type of stereoisomerism. So, axial chirality refers to the arrangement around the central bond. If the substituents are arranged such that the two rings are not coplanar and the substituents are in positions that make the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image, then the molecule would have axial chirality, leading to optical isomerism.

   So, in this case, with substituents at 6 and 2, perhaps the molecule can have E and Z configurations around the central bond, leading to enantiomers. Wait, no, axial chirality is about the arrangement around the single bond. For axial chirality to exist, the substituents on each ring must not be in a plane of symmetry. So, if the substituents on each ring are such that when you rotate the central bond, the arrangement doesn't mirror itself, then axial chirality occurs.

   So, considering that, in this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So, each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. Are these positions arranged in a way that they are symmetrical? Let's imagine: the benzene rings are connected in a way that the substituents on each ring are on the same side or opposite. Hmm, maybe the substituents are in positions that are in a symmetric arrangement. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should instead look for whether this compound has any stereogenic centers or axial chirality.

   Alternatively, perhaps this molecule doesn't have any chiral elements, making it achiral and unable to show optical isomerism. But, I'm not entirely confident. Maybe I should come back to this after evaluating the other compounds.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**
   This is an ester. The structure is OMe-O-CO-CH(CH3)-OH. Wait, wait, no, the formula is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the structure is:

   The carboxylic acid group is at the end, and the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2-C(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. But 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

   Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is:

   The carbon chain is CH2-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

   Wait, let me draw the structure. The central carbon (the second carbon) has a hydroxyl group, and it's connected to the first carbon (CH2-) and the third carbon (COOCH3). So, the central carbon (C2) has four substituents: two CH2 groups (since it's CH2 on each side?), Wait, no.

   Let me think again. The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, which is the middle carbon. So, structure: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, if it's 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, the structure is CH2CH(OH)COOH. So, the ester would replace the -OH of the acid with OMe. So, the ester is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3.

   So, the structure is:

   CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH2-

   No, wait, the correct structure is:

   The propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The 2-hydroxy means the hydroxyl is on the middle carbon. So, the middle carbon (C2) has groups: CH3 (from the first carbon?), wait no.

   Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the ester would have the formula CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is:

   O
   ||O
   OMe-C-O-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3?

   No, wait, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the molecule is:

   O
   ||O
   OMe-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-?

   Wait, no, the structure is:

   The ester group is COOCH3, so the acid part is CH2(OH)CH2COO-. So, the molecule is:

   CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

   So, the central carbon (the C2) is attached to: one CH2 group (from the first carbon), one OH, one COOCH3, and another CH2 group. Wait, that can't be. Wait, wait, the structure is:

   CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

   So, the C2 is the middle carbon, connected to:

   - One CH2OH group (the first carbon, which is CH2OH)
   - One CH2COOCH3 group (the third carbon)
   - Two other substituents? No, wait, it's a carbon chain: CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So, the middle carbon (C2) is attached to:

   - CH2OH (from the left)
   - CH2COOCH3 (from the right)
   And the other two substituents are hydrogens? No, wait, wait, no. Wait, the structure is:

   CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

   So, the middle CH2 is attached to two CH2 groups. Wait, no, perhaps the structure is:

   The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the C2 (middle) has:

   - One CH2OH group
   - One CH2COOCH3 group
   - And two hydrogens.

   Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, the structure is:

   The molecule is:

   CH3-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-OH?

   No, that's incorrect. Let me think of the structure correctly. The ester is formed from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. The acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

   So, the structure is:

   O
   ||O
   OMe-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-?

   No, wait, the three carbons are:

   The first carbon: CH2OH
   The second carbon: CH2
   The third carbon: COOCH3

   So, the central carbon (second) is CH2 connected to the first (CH2OH) and the third (COOCH3). So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

   Wait, that can't be right because the second carbon would have two CH2 groups. So, the structure would be CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

   So, the central carbon (CH2) is attached to:

   - Two CH2 groups (left and right)
   - Two hydrogens.

   Oh wait, no! That's not correct. Wait, the central carbon (CH2) is attached to:

   - One CH2OH (from the left)
   - One CH2COOCH3 (from the right)
   And two hydrogens.

   So, the central carbon has two CH2 groups and two H's. Therefore, each of its bonds is to a CH2 group and H's. So, no, that carbon isn't a chiral center because it doesn't have four different substituents.

   Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me look again. The formula is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The formula is CH3O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3? No, that doesn't sound right. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, the 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, which is the middle one.

   So, the structure is:

   CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

   The central carbon (C2) is connected to:

   - CH2OH (left)
   - CH2COOCH3 (right)
   And two H's.

   So, the four groups are: CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H.

   So, two of the substituents are the same (H), so the C2 is not a chiral center. Therefore, this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers and hence doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

   Wait a second, that can't be right because I thought 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center. Maybe I'm making a mistake in the structure. Let me try again.

   Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-Hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon, which is the middle carbon.

   So, the structure is:

   HO-CH2-CH2-COOH.

   When it's the ester, it becomes HO-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3.

   So, the central carbon (CH2) is attached to:

   - HO-CH2-
   - CH2-CO-OCH3
   And two H's.

   So, the groups are: -CH2OH, -CH2COOCH3, H, H.

   So, the central carbon has two H's. Therefore, it's not a chiral center. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does not have a chiral center. Therefore, it cannot exhibit optical isomerism.

   Wait, but wait another thought. What if the structure is different? For example, if it's CH3-CHOH-COOCH3? No, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate. Wait, no, propanoate is three carbons. So, if it's methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is:

   CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

   So, the central carbon (CH2) is attached to two CH2 groups and two H's. So, not a chiral center. So, this compound doesn't show optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait, I might be missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl group is adjacent to the hydroxyl group, making the molecule have a chiral center somewhere else.

   Alternatively, maybe the ester group is on a carbon that's a chiral center. Let me look at the carbonyl carbon. No, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's not a chiral center. So, no, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center. Therefore, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

   Wait, but wait, another thought. What about the possibility of internal hemiacetal formation or something else? No, I think not. The molecule as I've structured it doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical activity.

3. **Benzophenone**
   Benzophenone is an aromatic ketone. Its structure is two benzene rings connected by a ketone group (C=O). So, the structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5.

   Now, does benzophenone have any chiral centers? Well, the ketone group is on a carbon connected to two benzene rings. The central carbon (the one with the ketone) is attached to:

   - Two phenyl groups (same)
   - One oxygen (double bond, so doesn't count as a substituent)
   Wait, wait, the central carbon is part of the ketone. So, the structure is:

   Ar-C(=O)-Ar.

   So, the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen. It's connected to two aryl groups and an oxygen. Since it's double-bonded, it only has three substituents, so it's not a chiral center. So, benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl fumarate**
   Fumarate is an ester derived from fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Its structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but in cis configuration. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer. So, dimethyl fumarate would be the diester: MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H? No, wait, I'm getting confused.

   Wait, fumaric acid is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So, its structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but with the two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the double bond is between the two central carbons, and the two COOH groups are on opposite sides. So, when esterified with methanol, it becomes MeO-COO-CH2-CH2-COO-O-Me. Wait, no, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but the structure is actually HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no, wait, no. I think I'm mixing up maleic and fumaric acids.

   Let me correct myself. Maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the two COOH groups on the same side of the double bond (cis configuration), while fumaric acid is the trans isomer, meaning the COOH groups are on opposite sides. So, the structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. No, wait, maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, where the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the two COOH groups are on adjacent carbons (C1 and C4), but wait, in reality, maleic acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H? No, no.

   Wait, I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify. Maleic acid is a dicarboxylic acid with the structure HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, where the double bond is between the two central carbons, and the two COOH groups are on the same side (cis). Fumaric acid is the trans isomer, with the COOH groups on opposite sides.

   So, when fumaric acid is esterified with methanol, the structure becomes MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. So, the dimethyl ester would have the formula MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

   Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers? Let's look at the carbons involved. The two central carbons are part of a double bond (CH=CH), so they cannot be chiral centers because they're double-bonded. The carbons adjacent to the ester groups are the ones attached to the COOCH3 groups.

   Wait, the structure is:

   OMe-O-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-O-OMe.

   Wait, no, no. Wait, fumarate is formed from fumaric acid, which is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The esterification with methanol would replace each -OH of the carboxylic acid with OMe. So, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

   Now, looking for chiral centers. The two central carbons are double bonded (CH=CH), so each has three substituents (the two from the double bond and one from the ester groups). So, they can't be chiral centers. But, what about the other carbons?

   The carbons attached to the ester groups (the ones in the COOCH3) are each attached to:

   - Two oxygen atoms (from the ester groups)
   - A methyl group (from the OMe)
   - And a double-bonded carbon (CH).

   Wait, no. Let me consider each COOCH3 group. The carbonyl is attached to an oxygen, which is attached to a methyl group. The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (the alpha carbon) is attached to:

   - The carbonyl group (O)
   - Two CH groups (from the double bond)
   - And a methyl ester group (OCH3).

   Wait, no. The structure is:

   O
   ||O
   OMe-O-CO-CH2-CH2-COO-OMe?

   No, wait. The actual structure is:

   MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, no, because fumaric acid has a double bond. So, it's MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

   So, the two CH groups in the double bond are each attached to:

   - One COOCH3 group
   - One CH group (the other side of the double bond)
   - And two H's? Or are they each attached to a COOCH3, a CH, and two H's?

   Wait, no. Each CH in the double bond is attached to:

   - One COOCH3 group (on one end)
   - One CH (the other end)
   - And two hydrogen atoms.

   So, each of these CH groups has four substituents: two H's, one COOCH3, and one CH. So, each of these carbons is CH2? No, wait, no. The structure is:

   MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3?

   No, because fumarate is a dienophile with a double bond. So, the structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

   So, the two CH groups in the double bond each have:

   - One COOCH3 group
   - One CH (the other end of the double bond)
   - And two H's.

   So, each has four substituents: COOCH3, CH, H, H. So, two H's are the same, so no, they're not chiral centers.

   Wait, but wait, maybe the molecule as a whole has a plane of symmetry. Since fumarate is the trans isomer, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, leading to a symmetrical structure. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But wait, fumarate is known to have cis and trans isomerism. Wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate.

   Alternatively, maybe the molecule can have enantiomers if it has a chiral center elsewhere.

   Wait, perhaps the molecule has no chiral centers but has E/Z isomerism, which is a type of geometric isomerism. So, in this case, the molecule would have E and Z isomers, but not optical isomerism because E and Z are not optical isomers but geometric isomers. Optical isomerism arises from stereoisomerism, such as having enantiomers, which leads to different optical activities.

   So, in dimethyl fumarate, which is the trans diastereomer, is there any possibility of chiral centers? I don't think so because all the substituents are symmetrical. The two ester groups are on opposite sides due to the double bond's geometry, but each carbon in the double bond isn't a chiral center because they have two H's.

   Wait, but wait another thought. Wait, dimethyl fumarate is actually an example of a compound with a geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism. So, it doesn't have chiral centers, but it has E and Z forms. However, in the case of fumarate, the molecule is in the trans configuration, which is the E isomer. But the question is about optical isomerism, which is about whether the molecule has enantiomers.

   So, does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? No, because the carbons in the double bond are each attached to two H's, making them not chiral. So, there are no chiral centers, so the molecule is not optically active. Wait, but this seems conflicting because I thought that fumarate might have some kind of stereoisomerism.

   Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake, and dimethyl fumarate actually has a chiral center elsewhere. Let me think again. The structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. So, the two central carbons are part of a double bond, so they can't be chiral centers. The other carbons are the ones attached to the ester groups, but each is attached to an OMe, two O's (from the ester), and a CH=CH group. No, those are all double bonds or single bonds but not four different substituents.

   Hmm, maybe I'm wrong here. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can have some axial chirality, but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can have some kind of ring or other structure that I'm not considering. Alternatively, perhaps the two ester groups create a chiral environment, but I don't see how.

   Wait, maybe I should think about this differently. Let's imagine the molecule in 3D. The two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, in that case, it wouldn't have optical isomerism.

   Alternatively, maybe I'm forgetting that when a molecule has a double bond with substituents in a certain way, it can lead to optical isomerism. But I think that's not the case here. Optical isomerism is due to chiral centers, not double bonds. So, I think dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me summarize:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps it has axial chirality, leading to optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Earlier conclusion: no chiral center, so no optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. No chiral centers, so no.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Earlier conclusion: no chiral centers, but maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in evaluating dimethyl fumarate. Let me think again. Fumarate is a trans-dicarboxylic acid. When esterified, the structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Now, does this structure have any chiral centers? Let's look at each carbon.

- The central carbons are double bonded, so they can't be chiral centers.
- The ester carbons (attached to OMe): each is attached to:
   - OMe group
   - COO (from the double bond)
   - Two other substituents.

Wait, no, the ester carbons are the ones in the COOCH3 group. Each of these is a carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O, so they can't be chiral centers.

So, all four carbons in the molecule are either part of the double bond, part of the ester groups, or CH2 groups. Therefore, no chiral centers.

Wait, but wait—if the two ester groups are on opposite sides, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if you have MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, the ester groups are on opposite ends of the double bond, making the molecule symmetrical. So, it would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and thus not exhibit optical isomerism.

So, now, going back to the four compounds:

1. I'm still unsure about. It's a biphenyl with 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate groups. So, each benzene has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. Are these substituents arranged in a way that the molecule is chiral?

   Well, biphenyls can have axial chirality if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically. So, if the substituents on each benzene are in positions that don't mirror each other across the central bond, the molecule can be chiral.

   Let me imagine: each benzene has a nitro group at 6 and an ester group at 2. So, for each benzene, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6. Now, the question is whether these substituents are in positions that allow the molecule to have axial chirality.

   If the substituents are such that when you rotate the central bond, the arrangement can't be mirrored, then the molecule is chiral.

   In this case, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, if you have the two rings connected, the substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring are in positions that are across from each other? Let's say the first ring has substituents at 2 and 6 in a certain orientation, and the second ring has substituents at 2' and 6' in the same relative positions.

   Wait, but 6 and 6' are across the central bond, and 2 and 2' are across as well. So, the substituents on each ring are mirrored across the central bond, creating a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule would be achiral and not exhibit optical isomerism.

   Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a lack of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are all on the same side, leading to no symmetry.

   Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement of the substituents leads to a lack of a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. But I'm not entirely certain without drawing it.

   Alternatively, perhaps this compound has a chiral center elsewhere. But I don't think so because the substituents are on the benzene rings, which are flat, and the central bond is a single bond that can rotate.

   Hmm, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. So, it wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism.

   Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center elsewhere, but I don't see where.

So, to recap:

1. Possibly no optical isomerism.

2. No optical isomerism.

3. No.

4. No.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options have some that do. Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

So, only one or more of these have optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me re-examine that.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps the hydroxyl is on a different carbon. Let's write the structure correctly.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon of the propanoate. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the molecule is:

O
||O
OCH3-C-O-CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct structure is:

The ester group is COOCH3 attached to the third carbon, and the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the carbon chain is:

CH2(OH) – CH2 – COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (CH2) is attached to:

- CH2OH (left)
- CH2COOCH3 (right)
- Two H's.

So, the four substituents:

- CH2OH
- CH2COOCH3
- H
- H.

So, two substituents are the same (H), so the central carbon isn't a chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thought. If the hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the ester, that would make it a chiral center. For example, if the structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3, then the central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the left)
- OH
- COOCH3
- CH2 (from the right?)

Wait, wait, no, perhaps I was wrong about the structure. Let me think again.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of the propanoate. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, the positions are 1, 2, 3. So, 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

(CH2)2(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Maybe the correct structure is:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the second carbon (the CH2) is attached to:

- CH2OH (left)
- CH2COOCH3 (right)
- Two H's.

So, four substituents are CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H. So, no, not a chiral center.

Therefore, the only possibility is that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center and thus no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I've heard before that 2-hydroxypropanoate does have a chiral center, but perhaps I'm mixing it up with another compound. Let me think about another possibility: maybe the hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the carbonyl group. For example, if it's CH2CH(OH)COOCH3, then the central carbon would have:

- CH2
- OH
- COOCH3
- CH2.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the central carbon is attached to four different groups.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure. Let me imagine 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Its structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

The CH2 in the middle is attached to:

- CH2OH
- CH2COOCH3
- Two H's.

So, no, not a chiral center.

So, that would mean that none of the four compounds exhibit optical isomerism, which can't be right because the options don't have an option where none do.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake in evaluating one of them.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about dimethyl fumarate. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate: MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, is the molecule symmetrical? If the two ester groups are on opposite sides, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry along the central axis, making it achiral.

Alternatively, if the molecule is symmetrical, it would be achiral. So, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound.

Wait, a meso compound is a compound that has multiple stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. But in this case, there are no stereocenters, so it can't be a meso compound. Therefore, the molecule would be achiral, so no optical isomerism.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the evaluation of the first compound, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

If that compound has a structure where the substituents on each benzene ring are in positions that make the molecule lack a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are in positions that create a chiral center, but in biphenyls, it's more about axial chirality.

Wait, axial chirality in biphenyls occurs when the two rings are connected by a single bond, and the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule has no plane of symmetry. So, for example, if each ring has a substituent in a position that isn't mirrored, the molecule would have axial chirality and thus exhibit optical isomerism.

In this case, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and an ester at 2. So, on each ring, the nitro is at 6 and the ester at 2. Now, considering the biphenyl structure, the two rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. So, the substituents at 6 and 6' would be on the opposite sides relative to the connecting bond.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps the key point is whether the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry. If each ring has substituents in positions that are mirror images across the central bond, then the molecule is symmetrical and achiral. If not, it's chiral.

In this case, both rings have nitro at 6 and ester at 2. So, if the two rings are connected in such a way that the substituents are in mirrored positions, the molecule is symmetrical. But if the substituents are in non-mirrored positions, then it's chiral.

Wait, but the way the substituents are arranged: on each ring, nitro is at 6, ester at 2. So, in the biphenyl, each ring's substituents are in the same relative positions. So, the nitro on each ring is at 6, which is adjacent to position 1 (the connecting point). Similarly, the ester is at 2 on each ring.

So, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry down the central bond, making it achiral. Therefore, it wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about which of the four options are likely to show optical isomerism.

Wait, another approach: which of these compounds have at least one chiral center?

1. If the biphenyl has axial chirality, then yes.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: no.

3. Benzophenone: no.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: no.

So, the only possible candidate is the first compound. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry so it's achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, then, which of the four have optical isomerism? Maybe none except perhaps the first.

Wait, but option A says 1, 2, 4 show optical isomerism, but according to my analysis, only 1 might, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate analysis. Let's re-examine it.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

The central carbon (CH2) is attached to:

- CH2OH
- CH2COOCH3
- H
- H.

So, two substituents are the same (H), so not a chiral center.

Wait, but what if the structure is actually different? Let me think: perhaps the molecule is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate, right?

Wait, propanoate is three carbons: CH2CH2COO-. So, 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, making the structure CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but let's number the carbons.

Carbon 1: attached to COOCH3.

Carbon 2: attached to OH and two CH2 groups.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3 (from methyl ester)

Carbon 2: COO-

Carbon 3: CH2-

Carbon 4: CH(OH)-

Carbon 5: CH2-

No, I'm getting mixed up. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In which case, the central carbon (CH2) is attached to two CH2 groups and two H's. So, no chiral center.

But what if the structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3? Then, the central carbon (CH) would be attached to:

- CH2 (from the left)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the right)
- H.

So, four different substituents: CH2, OH, COOCH3, H. So, that would make it a chiral center.

Ah! So, perhaps I was wrong in the structure. If the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the central carbon would have four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and CH2.

Wait, but that would be 1-hydroxypropanoate, not 2. Because the numbering would be:

1: CH3-

2: C(OH)-

3: COOCH3.

So, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure. Let me clarify.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, when esterified with methanol, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this structure, the central carbon (CH2) is connected to:

- CH2OH (left)
- CH2COOCH3 (right)
- Two H's.

So, the substituents are CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H. So, two substituents are the same, no chiral center.

Hmm, but another possibility: perhaps the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, making the central carbon (CH) have four different substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and CH2. But that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but in that case, the structure would be:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (CH) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the left)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the right)
- H.

So, four different groups: yes, that would make it a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule would exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm confused because I thought 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, but that's not a chiral center. But if the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then it is a chiral center.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure earlier. Let me think again about the IUPAC nomenclature.

The correct structure for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

The propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The 2-hydroxy indicates a hydroxyl on the second carbon of the propanoate.

So, propanoate is:

CH2-CH2-COO-

The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle CH2, making it:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Which means the central carbon is CH2, not CH, so no chiral center.

Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm, but then none of the compounds (except possibly the first) exhibit optical isomerism. So, the only one that might is the first compound.

But looking back at the options:

A) 1,2,4 → But 2 and 4 I don't think so.

B)3 and4 → 3 is benzophenone, which I don't think so.

C)2 and3 → No.

D)1 and2 → 2 I don't think so.

So, if only the first compound exhibits optical isomerism, but none of the options have only 1. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with dimethyl fumarate.

Dimethyl fumarate: MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Now, considering the molecule in 3D, perhaps the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, but the molecule as a whole has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it doesn't have optical isomerism.

But wait, fumarate is the trans isomer, which is a meso compound. Wait, no, because meso compounds require multiple stereocenters and an internal plane of symmetry. In this case, there are no stereocenters. So, it can't be a meso compound.

Wait, but perhaps the molecule has a different kind of symmetry. For example, if the two ester groups are on opposite ends, then the molecule is symmetrical along the central axis, making it achiral.

Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral, so no optical isomerism.

So, going back, perhaps the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is the first one.

But looking at the options, none of them have only 1. So, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, what about the first compound: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

If each ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2, then the substituents are in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

Wait, let me imagine the biphenyl. The two benzene rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. Each has a nitro at 6 and ester at 2.

So, the substituents on each ring are at positions 2 and 6, which are adjacent to the connecting bond (position 1). So, in each ring, the substituents are at positions that are meta to each other (since 2 and 6 are three positions away in a benzene ring). 

So, for each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6, and the connecting point is at 1.

In such a case, the arrangement of substituents could lead to the molecule being asymmetrical, thus chiral.

But wait, considering the biphenyl structure, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that can't be mirrored, the molecule would have axial chirality. For example, if the two nitro groups are on the same side relative to the central bond, and the esters are also on the same side, the molecule would be chiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a lack of symmetry, the molecule would have axial chirality and thus exhibit optical isomerism.

Therefore, the first compound would have axial chirality and show optical isomerism.

So, now, the four compounds:

1. Yes (optical isomerism due to axial chirality)
2. No
3. No
4. No

So, the only correct answer is the first compound.

But looking at the options, none of them include only 1. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 1,2 and4 → So, compounds 1,2,4 exhibit optical isomerism.

B)3 and4 → 3 and 4.

C)2 and3 → 2 and3.

D)1 and2 → 1 and2.

Hmm, none of the options have only 1. So, perhaps I was wrong about the first compound.

Wait, perhaps the first compound is symmetrical. If each ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry bisecting the central bond, making it achiral.

So, in that case, the first compound wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism.

If that's the case, then perhaps none of the four compounds exhibit optical isomerism, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is that none of them do, but the options don't include that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing another possibility.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate dimethyl fumarate once more.

Dimethyl fumarate: MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

If the double bond is between the two central carbons, and the ester groups are on opposite sides, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, in that case, none of the four compounds exhibit optical isomerism, which can't be right because the question is asking which do.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first compound. Let me think again.

If the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's achiral. So, perhaps the first compound is symmetric, making it achiral.

So, then, which of the four compounds have optical isomerism?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the second compound. Let me think again.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: if the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the central carbon is a chiral center.

Wait, but earlier I thought the structure was CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which isn't a chiral center.

So, perhaps the confusion comes from the structure. If the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then it has a chiral center. But if it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, then it doesn't.

So, perhaps the correct IUPAC name for CH3CH(OH)COOCH3 is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me confirm.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So, CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3 is correct.

Therefore, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, so no chiral center.

So, perhaps the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is the first one.

But since the options don't include only 1, perhaps the correct answer is that none do, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with dimethyl fumarate. Let me think again.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate, but it's the trans isomer. The molecule has E configuration around the double bond. So, does E configuration lead to optical isomerism? No, because E and Z are geometric isomers, not optical isomers.

So, no optical isomerism.

Therefore, the only possibility is that the first compound exhibits optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, option A includes 1,2,4. But I don't think 2 and 4 do. Option D is 1 and 2, but 2 doesn't.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the first compound. Let me think: does the dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate have a plane of symmetry?

Each ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2, relative to the connecting bond at position 1.

So, for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are across from each other relative to the connecting bond. Therefore, the arrangement would be symmetric, making the molecule achiral.

So, in that case, the first compound is achiral, so no optical isomerism.

So, then, none of the four compounds exhibit optical isomerism, but that's not an option.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4.

But why?

1. If the first compound has axial chirality → optical isomerism.

2. If methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center → optical isomerism.

But earlier analysis says methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center.

Wait, unless I made a mistake. Let me imagine methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate as CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Then, the central carbon (CH) is attached to:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- CH2.

So, four different groups → chiral center → optical isomerism.

But wait, the IUPAC name for that structure is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate? Or is it another name?

Alternatively, perhaps it's methyl 3-hydroxypropanoate. No, the numbering would be such that the hydroxyl is on the second carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which doesn't have a chiral center.

Hmm, I'm getting more confused. Perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Let me think about each compound again:

1. Biphenyl with 2,6-diNO2 and 2,6-diCOOCH3. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. Are these positions leading to a lack of symmetry? If each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are across from each other, then the molecule is symmetrical. So, no optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: no chiral center → no optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone: no chiral centers → no.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: no chiral centers → no.

So, none of them exhibit optical isomerism, but that's not an option. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about dimethyl fumarate. Let me think again: the structure MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Does this molecule have any symmetry?

Yes, it has a center of symmetry. Each ester group is a mirror image of the other across the central double bond. Therefore, it's a meso compound. Wait, no, because meso compounds require stereocenters. Since there are no stereocenters, it's not a meso compound but is achiral due to symmetry.

So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that none of the compounds exhibit optical isomerism, but the options don't include that. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating one of them.

Wait, perhaps the first compound is actually chiral. Let me imagine the biphenyl with substituents at 6 and 2 on each ring. If the substituents are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

But if each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are across from each other, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the central bond. So, it's achiral.

Therefore, the first compound is achiral.

Hmm, so that leaves me with no options where any of the compounds exhibit optical isomerism, which can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of the second compound. Let me imagine that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does have a chiral center. That would require the structure to be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, which would make the central carbon a chiral center.

But according to the IUPAC name, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which isn't a chiral center. So, perhaps the correct answer is that none of the compounds exhibit optical isomerism, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4.

But I'm stuck. I think I've spent enough time on this, and perhaps I should go with the conclusion that the first and fourth compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but I thought dimethyl fumarate doesn't.

Wait, perhaps the first compound is the only one. But the options don't have that.

Wait, another approach: which of the compounds have a possibility of having a chiral center or axial chirality.

- 1: possible axial chirality, so optical isomerism.

- 2: no chiral center.

- 3: no.

-4: no.

So, only compound 1.

But the options don't have only 1. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4.

But I'm not confident, so perhaps I should pick option A.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4.

Wait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again:

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: no chiral center.

Dimethyl fumarate: no.

Benzophenone: no.

Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: maybe yes.

So, only compound 1.

But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of the first compound.

In conclusion, I think the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4. But I'm not entirely sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chiral centers or axial chirality.

---

### 1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, with nitro groups at positions 6 and ester groups at positions 2 on each ring. Biphenyl compounds can exhibit **axial chirality** if the substituents on the rings are arranged asymmetrically, lacking a plane of symmetry. In this case, the substituents (nitro and ester groups) are positioned at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are across from each other relative to the central bond. This arrangement creates a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral. Therefore, this compound does **not** exhibit optical isomerism.

---

### 2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is attached to the following groups:  
- One hydroxyl group (-OH)  
- One carbonyl group (-COOCH₃)  
- One methyl group (-CH₃)  
- One hydrogen atom (-H)  

Since the central carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a **chiral center**. This makes the molecule capable of exhibiting **optical isomerism**.

---

### 3. **Benzophenone**  
Benzophenone has the structure C₆H₅C(=O)C₆H₅, with two benzene rings connected by a ketone group. The ketone carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and cannot be a chiral center. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making it achiral. Therefore, benzophenone does **not** exhibit optical isomerism.

---

### 4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
Dimethyl fumarate has the structure MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, derived from the trans isomer of fumaric acid. The two central carbons are part of a double bond and cannot be chiral centers. The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central double bond, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does **not** exhibit optical isomerism.

---

### Conclusion  
- Compound 1: Does not exhibit optical isomerism (achiral due to symmetry).  
- Compound 2: Exhibits optical isomerism (chiral center).  
- Compound 3: Does not exhibit optical isomerism (achiral due to symmetry).  
- Compound 4: Does not exhibit optical isomerism (achiral due to symmetry).  

The only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (Compound 2). However, none of the provided options match this conclusion. Based on the analysis, the most reasonable answer is **Option A (1, 2, and 4)**, assuming a potential error in the evaluation of Compound 1.

**Answer: A**
