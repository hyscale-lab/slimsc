Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. The question is about identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me visualize its structure. So, it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached. Wait, no, maybe it's a cyclohexyl group connected to a CH(OH) group, which is also attached to another cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that there's a cyclohexane ring with a -CH(OH-Cyclohexyl) group and a formyl (aldehyde) group.

Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally. The compound is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. That means a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group attached. Then, at the 1-position (so adjacent to the aldehyde), there's a substituent which is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. So, it's -CH(OH-Cyclohexyl) attached to the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl). Wait, maybe it's a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group that has a hydroxyl group. So the substituent is a CH2-OH group attached to a cyclohexyl group, but wait, that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is in turn attached to another cyclohexane ring with a formyl group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the synthesis steps. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

So, the target is to form a molecule that has both a formyl group (aldehyde) and a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl group. So, perhaps the synthesis involves adding these groups in a specific way.

Let me consider possible reagents that can perform the necessary transformations. Ethynylcyclohexane is a sp-hybridized carbon attached to the cyclohexane. So, what can I do with an alkyne like this?

One approach might be to perform a hydration reaction. Alkyne hydration can give ketones or aldehydes depending on conditions. For example, using H2SO4 and HgSO4 (which is a hydration catalyst) would typically convert an internal alkyne into a ketone, but ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne, so I think it would form an aldehyde upon catalytic hydration. Wait, no, wait—terminal alkynes under acidic conditions tend to form ketones because the triple bond is at the end, so when they add water, they can form either aldehydes (with HgSO4 in H2SO4 and H2O) or ketones (if the conditions are different). Wait, no, wait: I think the hydration of a terminal alkyne with H2SO4, HgSO4, and water typically gives a ketone because of the addition of two water molecules: the triple bond adds one water to give a ketone. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. For a terminal alkyne like HC≡C-R, acid-catalyzed hydration would typically lead to the formation of a ketone: R-CO-CH3? No, wait, maybe not. Wait, no, the hydration of a terminal alkyne (like ethyne) would form an aldehyde. Hmm, maybe I should double-check. Oh wait, no—terminal alkynes upon acid-catalyzed hydration (like with H2SO4 and HgSO4) typically give ketones because the alkyne adds two water molecules in a way that forms a carbonyl group with a methyl group. So, for ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH), when we hydrate it, perhaps the triple bond converts to a ketone. Wait, but that's a terminal alkyne. Alternatively, perhaps it would go to a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps using a different method. For example, using a strong base like NaNH2. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used to deprotonate compounds. But wait, ethynylcyclohexane has a terminal alkyne, which is acidic. The terminal proton on the alkyne is quite acidic, pKa around 25. So, NaNH2 (which is a strong base, NH2^- is a strong base) can deprotonate the alkyne to form a cyclohexylacetylide ion.

Once we have the acetylide, what reactions can we perform? Acetylides can undergo alkylation. So, treating with methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate the acetylide, giving cyclohexylacetylide with a methyl group added. Wait, but in what way? The acetylide is a strong base and would attack an alkyl halide. So, if we have CH3Cl, the acetylide (which is a strong base) would abstract a methyl group from CH3Cl, leading to the alkyne getting a methyl substitution.

Wait, let me think. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. After deprotonation with NaNH2, we have cyclohexylacetylide. Then, adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate it, so we'd get cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH3? Wait, no, because the acetylide is cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-^–, and adding CH3Cl would lead to cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH2Cl? No, wait, no, wait. Wait, acetylide is CH2-C≡C–, and methyl chloride is CH3Cl. The acetylide's carbon is nucleophilic and would attack the methyl chloride, giving CH2-C≡C-CH2Cl, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is at the end, so when you add methyl chloride, it would add a methyl group to the sp carbon, making the alkyne longer.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me outline the possible steps. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and another substituent that includes a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps the synthesis involves adding a methyl group, then some kind of oxidation, and maybe an aldoxymerization or something else.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve forming a diol, then oxidizing it to a carbonyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the target structure has a branching point where a cyclohexyl group is attached via a CH(OH) group to the main cyclohexane ring and an aldehyde group.

Wait, another approach: Let's look at the options and see what reagents are involved.

Looking at the options, they each have a series of reagents. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd
3. Ba(OH)2
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O

So reagent 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. That suggests deprotonation of the alkyne to form acetylide, then alkylation with CH3Cl. That would add a methyl group to the alkyne. Then, H2/Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond. So, triple bond to single bond, adding two hydrogens. So, the alkyne becomes an alkane. Then Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, maybe for elimination or for epoxide opening, but not sure. Then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O: that's a typical setup for the oxidation of a secondary alcohol to a ketone, or perhaps for the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but I'm not sure.

Option B:
1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3, H2O
4. NH4OH

So first, deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form the acetylide, then alkylate with ethyl chloride to get a longer alkyne. Then Li in liquid NH3: that's a strong base for elimination, perhaps forming a more substituted alkyne, but wait, Li and NH3 is used for deprotonation and elimination, maybe for forming a more substituted triple bond or for directing the position of substitution. Then O3 in H2O: ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. But wait, we're dealing with an alkyne here, not a double bond. Unless after some steps, a double bond is formed. Hmm.

Option C:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate
3. O3/(CH3)2S
4. Ba(OH)2

So step 1: same as option A, form a methyl-substituted alkyne. Step 2: hydrogenate with H2 and Pd, but in presence of CaCO3, which is a catalyst support. So, hydrogenating the alkyne to a single bond. Then O3 and (CH3)2S: ozonolysis followed by reductive workup (since (CH3)2S is a reductant). Ozonolysis typically breaks double bonds, but in this case, after hydrogenation, the alkyne is now a single bond, so perhaps this isn't applicable. Alternatively, maybe the Pd-CaCO3 is for partial hydrogenation, but I'm not sure.

Option D:
1. NaNH2, methanol
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/(CH3)2S
4. NH4OH

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Wait, methanol is CH3OH. Deprotonating the alkyne with NaNH2 would form the acetylide, but then adding methanol would perhaps lead to alkylation with a methyl group from methanol? Or maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, NaNH2 is used to deprotonate, then perhaps methanol acts as an alkylating agent. But CH3OH is not a good alkylating agent unless activated. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydration step. I'm a bit confused about this step.

Wait, maybe I should think about the target molecule's structure again. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, it's a cyclohexane ring (let's say ring A) with a substituent at position 1. The substituent is -(cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, so that's a CH(OH) group attached to a cyclohexyl group. And ring A also has a formyl group (CHO) at position 1, but wait, no, because the substituent is at position 1. Wait, perhaps ring A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (a cyclohexane with a CHO group), and at position 1 (adjacent to the aldehyde), there's a substituent which is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH(OH) group. So, the substituent is -(CH(OH)-cyclohexyl).

Hmm, so perhaps the substituent is a CH(OH) group connected to a cyclohexyl group, and that substituent is attached to the main cyclohexane ring, which also has the aldehyde group.

So, how do we get that structure from ethynylcyclohexane?

Let me think about the possible steps.

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane (structure: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH).

First, perhaps deprotonate the terminal alkyne with NaNH2 to form the acetylide ion: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C^- + NH2^-.

Then, treating with methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate the acetylide, adding a methyl group to the alkyne. So, the alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3 (but attached to cyclohexane). Wait, no, the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3. Hmm, but that's an internal alkyne now?

Wait, perhaps another approach: perhaps we need to form a cyclopropane ring or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve forming a gem-dimethyl group, which upon elimination would form a double bond, then undergoing some kind of dihydroxylation or oxidation. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene, which is then epoxidized, and so on.

Wait, another thought: the target has an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. So perhaps the synthesis involves introducing a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group connected to a cyclohexane ring.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into an aldehyde. So, using the hydration of the terminal alkyne with HgSO4 and H2SO4 would give an aldehyde. So, ethynylcyclohexane would become cyclohexane-CH2-CHO. Wait, but that's a straight aldehyde. But then, how do we get the substituent with the cyclohexyl group and hydroxymethyl?

Alternatively, perhaps after forming the aldehyde, we need to introduce a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, maybe the starting material undergoes deprotonation and alkylation to add a methyl group, then hydrogenation, then some kind of oxidation or dihydroxylation.

Wait, let's look at the options again.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2 and methyl chloride, then H2/Pd-calcium carbonate (hydrogenation of alkyne to alkane?), then O3 with (CH3)2S (ozonolysis?), then Ba(OH)2.

Wait, after step 1, the alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane. Then, hydrogenation would turn the triple bond into a single bond, giving cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the alkyne is CH2-C≡C-CH3, so hydrogenation would turn it into CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the triple bond would become a single bond with two CH2 groups. So cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Hmm, that doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond. Wait, but H2 and Pd would typically hydrogenate triple bonds all the way to single bonds, not stopping at double bonds. Unless it's Lindlar's catalyst, which would hydrogenate to cis double bonds, but that's not the case here.

So, perhaps after hydrogenation, we have a single bond, and then ozonolysis wouldn't do anything because there's no double bond. Hmm, so maybe option C isn't the right path.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2 and methanol, then Li in NH3, then O3 with (CH3)2S, then NH4OH.

Wait, step 1 in D: NaNH2 and methanol. So, the alkyne is deprotonated to the acetylide, which is then treated with methanol. Methanol is a methylating agent, but acetylides are strong bases and may deprotonate the methanol. However, perhaps the acetylide can undergo alkylation with methanol as a methyl source, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydration step. Wait, but in the presence of NaNH2, which is a strong base, perhaps the reaction is deprotonation only. Methanol could be acting as a proton source? Or maybe it's a quench step after deprotonation. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step in option D is simply deprotonation of the alkyne to form the acetylide, then adding methanol would lead to a substitution reaction. But I'm not certain.

Looking back at the target, perhaps the steps involve adding a methyl group to the alkyne, then hydrogenating to form a CH2 group, then introducing an epoxide or some diol, which upon treatment gives the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence involves adding a methyl group to the alkyne, then hydrogenating the alkyne to form a CH2 group, then oxidizing to introduce a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the target's structure requires the formation of a vicinal diol, which upon oxidation would give a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about each reagent's role.

Looking at option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol: Probably deprotonating the alkyne to form the acetylide. Then, perhaps quenching with methanol would give a product where the acetylide is protonated by methanol, leading to a methyl group addition. So, the alkyne becomes CH2-O-Me? Or perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is treated with methanol, which acts as an electrophile, leading to substitution and forming a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps the first step is deprotonation to form the acetylide, then treatment with CH3OH leads to alkylation, giving cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to form a larger alkyne, then hydrogenate it, then perform some kind of oxidation.

Alternatively, considering the target has a cyclohexane ring attached via a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps an epoxide is formed, which upon opening would give a diol, and then further reaction would form the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, maybe the correct sequence is:

1. Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form acetylide.

2. Alkylate with methyl chloride to form a longer alkyne.

3. Hydrogenate to form an alkane.

4. Perform oxidation to form a carbonyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via hydration, then undergoes some addition reactions.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C. Let's see:

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → forms a methyl-substituted alkyne.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond, so the triple bond becomes a single bond with two CH2 groups.

So the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Or wait, perhaps it's cyclohexane-CH(CH2CH3), but that doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck.

Another angle: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the main cyclohexane ring. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming that CH(OH)-cyclohexyl substituent.

How can we form that substituent? One possibility is through a Grignard reaction or similar. Alternatively, perhaps via a hydroxymethylation.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps the ethynyl group is used in a [2+2] cycloaddition or some other reaction to form a cyclopropane ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence involves adding a methyl group, then hydrogenating the alkyne to an alkene, which is then epoxidized and opened to form a diol, which upon treatment gives the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, but looking at the options, none have an epoxidation step. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 in option A is for forming an epoxide, but I'm not certain.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Maybe it's used for elimination reactions. If there's an alcohol present, Ba(OH)2 could help in forming an epoxide, but I'm not clear on that.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for the oxidation of alcohols. Wait, but I'm more familiar with KMnO4 or other oxidizing agents for that.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for the reagents that would form the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, the target has a formyl group. So perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group. For that, acid-catalyzed hydration of the terminal alkyne would give an aldehyde. So, using H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O would convert the terminal alkyne into an aldehyde.

Wait, but option A has that as the last step. So let's see.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → forms a methyl-substituted acetylide.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond, with two CH2 groups. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2 → strong base; perhaps elimination to form a double bond.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → hydration of a triple bond? But wait, if we've already hydrogenated the alkyne to a single bond, then step 4 would not have a triple bond to work on. Hmm, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order. Let me think again. Option A: step 4 is the hydration. But the alkyne was hydrogenated in step 2. So step 4 would not have an alkyne anymore. So that's probably not correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to first perform the alkylation, then hydrogenate, and then do something else. But I'm not making progress.

Another approach: Let's consider the target molecule and think about the possible steps to reach it.

1. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane.

2. We need to add a methyl group to the alkyne, perhaps via deprotonation and alkylation (NaNH2 and CH3Cl).

3. Then, hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene or an alkane. Wait, but for an aldehyde, maybe we need to stop at an alkene and perform an oxidation.

Wait, if after alkylation, the alkyne is now CH2-C≡C-CH3 (but attached to cyclohexane), perhaps hydrogenation would turn it into CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps after alkylation, we have cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3. Then, partial hydrogenation with H2 and Lindlar's catalyst (but the options don't specify that) would yield a cis double bond, but without Lindlar's, the hydrogenation would go all the way to single bond.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Once the alkyne is hydrogenated to a single bond, maybe we can oxidize it to form a carbonyl group. Wait, but oxidizing a single bond (alkane) wouldn't form a carbonyl, unless adjacent to an alcohol.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the Ba(OH)2 in option A is for a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → deprotonate alkyne to form acetylide, then treat with methanol. Maybe the acetylide attacks CH3OH, leading to substitution, giving cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-OCH3? Or perhaps it's a different reaction.

2. Li in liquid NH3 → this is a strong base, maybe for elimination. If we have an ether group, perhaps it eliminates to form an alkene.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S → ozonolysis of the alkene, which would cleave it into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → workup after ozonolysis, perhaps to form aldehydes or ketones.

Wait, but I'm not sure how this would lead to the target structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

- Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate to acetylide, alkylate to add a methyl group.

- Hydrogenate to form a single bond.

- Then, perform some kind of epoxidation, but I don't see that in any options.

Wait, perhaps the target's structure is formed via a two-step alkylation and then oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → form a methyl-substituted alkyne.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S → ozonolysis. But wait, if the alkyne is hydrogenated to a single bond, there's no double bond to ozonolyze. So that doesn't make sense. Hence, option C might not be correct.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the target again.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and a substituent that has a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl group. So, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction or some kind of addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, then subjected to some addition to form the hydroxymethyl group attached to the cyclohexyl.

Wait, perhaps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate with NaNH2 and methyl chloride → form a longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenate to form an alkane.

3. Then, perform some oxidation to form an aldehyde.

But I'm not seeing how the substituent is added.

Wait, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 in option A is for creating a diol, then oxidizing to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is for epoxidation, but that's not typical. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could be used for elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, if we have ethynylcyclohexane, after deprotonation and alkylation, we have a longer alkyne. Then, hydrogenate to a single bond. Then, Ba(OH)2 could cause elimination to form a double bond at that position. Then, perhaps ozonolysis would cleave that double bond.

Wait, but none of the options have ozonolysis except B and C.

Wait, option A's steps:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride → alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → alkyne becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2 → elimination to form a double bond (if possible)?

Wait, but CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 is a single bond, so elimination would require adjacent H's. Perhaps Ba(OH)2 could deprotonate and cause elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after hydrogenation, Ba(OH)2 would cause some oxidation or elimination, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck and should try to think about the synthesis pathway differently.

Another approach: The target has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. So perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into the aldehyde, and then some kind of addition reaction forms the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, so step 1: hydrate the alkyne to form an aldehyde.

Then, perhaps introduce a substituent via some reaction.

But where would that substituent come from? Maybe via a substitution reaction.

Wait, so perhaps the steps are:

1. Hydrate ethynylcyclohexane to get cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

2. Then, some reaction to add a substituent with a cyclohexyl group and hydroxymethyl.

But how? Maybe via a Grignard reaction, but that would require an organometallic reagent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is introduced via a nucleophilic attack on a carbonyl group.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D. Let's see.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2 and methanol → deprotonate the alkyne to form acetylide, then perhaps treat with methanol to form a methyl ether. But I'm not sure how that helps.

2. Li in liquid NH3 → strong base, possibly for elimination. If the previous step formed an ether, elimination could form a double bond.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S → ozonolysis of the double bond, which would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → workup, maybe to form aldehydes.

But I'm not seeing how this leads to the target structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkyne becomes longer with an ethyl group.

2. Li in liquid NH3 → elimination to form a more substituted alkyne.

3. O3, H2O → ozonolysis of the alkyne? Wait, no, ozonolysis is for alkenes, not alkynes. Unless the alkyne is converted into a diene, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the alkyne is converted into an alkene via elimination, then ozonolysis would cleave it.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option A.

Option A's steps:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and alkylation with methyl chloride.

2. Hydrogenation to single bond.

3. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps elimination to form a double bond.

4. Hydration with H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → convert the double bond into a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, if after step 3, we have a double bond, then step 4 would add water across it to form a carbonyl group.

So, let's outline this:

Start with ethynylcyclohexane.

Step 1: NaNH2 and CH3Cl → forms cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenates the triple bond to single bond: cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Unless the hydrogenation is partial, but with H2 and Pd, it would go all the way.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation isn't of the alkyne but another part. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond, but without specific catalysts, it's unlikely.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the options again. Let me consider each step in each option and see which makes sense.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride → H2/Pd → Ba(OH)2 → H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

So after step 1, the alkyne is longer. Step 2, H2/Pd converts the triple bond to a single bond.

So, structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2 → perhaps elimination to form a double bond. But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. If the molecule is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, where would elimination occur? Maybe not possible, as there's no adjacent H for elimination.

Hmm, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol → Li/liq. NH3 → O3/(CH3)2S → NH4OH.

After step 1: Perhaps the alkyne is converted to a methyl ether or another group.

Step 2: Li in NH3 is a strong base, perhaps causing elimination to form a double bond.

So, after step 2, we have an alkene.

Step 3: Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups. So, for example, if we have a cyclohexane ring with a CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 group (from step 1), and step 2 forms a double bond, say CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 becomes CH2=CH-CH2-CH3? Wait, but ozonolysis would break the double bond into two aldehydes. So, if the structure after step 2 is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond in the middle, ozonolysis would cleave it into two aldehydes. But I'm not sure how that leads to the target structure.

Another thought: The target molecule has two cyclohexane rings. One as the main ring with the aldehyde, and another as the substituent. So perhaps the substituent is added via some kind of coupling reaction or alkylation.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D because after ozonolysis, we get aldehyde groups which could form the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps after ozonolysis and workup, the aldehyde groups could undergo some addition reactions to form the hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about each option's outcome.

Let me think about option D again:

If step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol, perhaps the alkyne is deprotonated, and then treated with methanol, which could lead to the formation of a methyl ester or some substitution. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps NaNH2 in methanol would lead to the formation of a gem-dimethyl group, which upon elimination would form an alkene, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps in option D are designed to form the substituent via a Grignard-like addition.

But I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should look for the correct answer based on the reagents.

The target molecule has an aldehyde group, which suggests that the alkyne was converted into a carbonyl group. The reagent for that is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O (hydration of the alkyne to form an aldehyde). So, that's step 4 in option A.

In option A, step 4 is the aldehyde formation. So, the sequence would be:

1. Alkyne → alkyne with methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate alkyne to single bond.

3. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps elimination to form a double bond.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → hydration to form aldehyde.

But wait, after step 2, the alkyne is hydrogenated to a single bond, so step 4's reagents wouldn't affect anything, as there's no triple bond left. So perhaps option A is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is not hydrogenated but instead converted into a carbonyl group in step 4.

Wait, if the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate and alkylate to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate to a single bond.

3. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps oxidation or elimination.

4. Hydration to form aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Option C's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → add methyl group to alkyne.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate alkyne to single bond.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S → ozonolysis. Wait, but if the alkyne is hydrogenated to a single bond, there's no double bond for ozonolysis. So this doesn't make sense.

So maybe option C is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → deprotonate to form acetylide, then perhaps quench with methanol to form a methyl group.

2. Li in NH3 → strong base, perhaps elimination to form a double bond.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S → ozonolysis of the double bond, which would cleave it into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → workup, perhaps to form aldehydes.

But how would this produce the target? If the initial structure after step 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. So, maybe after ozonolysis, one end becomes an aldehyde, and the other becomes a ketone or another aldehyde.

But the target has a single aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D because the first step adds a methyl group and then the Li in NH3 leads to elimination, creating a more substituted double bond, then ozonolysis forms two carbonyls, which upon workup gives the desired substituents.

But I'm not certain. I'm getting stuck.

Wait, maybe the correct option is option C.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, considering that the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane, which in turn is attached to another cyclohexane with an aldehyde.

Perhaps the substituent is formed via a hydroxymethylation reaction. That could involve a Grignard reagent or some kind of addition to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a cyanohydrin formation, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D because the steps involve forming a double bond, which upon ozonolysis would give aldehyde groups, which could then form the substituent.

Alternatively, after ozonolysis, each carbonyl could add a hydroxymethyl group, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

But I'm not confident. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the possible steps.

Wait, let me think again about the steps in option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol: forms acetylide, then perhaps methylates it, giving a longer alkyne.

2. Li in NH3: strong base, perhaps causes dehydrohalogenation or elimination to form a more substituted alkyne.

Wait, but Li in NH3 is often used for eliminations, maybe converting an alkyne into a more substituted one. But I'm not certain.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S: ozonolysis, but if the alkyne is now a more substituted one, perhaps the alkyne isn't reacting. Wait, no, ozonolysis is for alkenes, not alkynes. So maybe step 2 converts the alkyne into an alkene, which is then ozonolyzed.

But I'm not sure how that would form the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option A, as it uses the hydration reagents as the last step to form the aldehyde.

But I'm not certain.

After thinking through all the possibilities, I think the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. How can that be formed? Perhaps via a substitution reaction where a hydroxymethyl group replaces a leaving group.

But I don't see any reagents in the options that would introduce a hydroxymethyl group directly.

Wait, perhaps the hydroxymethyl group is formed via a Grignard reaction. But Grignard reagents are typically RMgX, which aren't mentioned in any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxymethyl group is formed via an oxymercuration or similar reaction, but that typically involves adding an -OH group in a specific way.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is option D.

But I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll make a choice.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) and a substituent at the 1-position, which is a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the terminal alkyne to form an acetylide, which is then alkylated with methyl chloride to add a methyl group.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, resulting in a saturated compound.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly used for elimination or oxidation, but the exact role here is unclear.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Hydration reagents typically used to convert alkynes to carbonyl compounds. However, since the alkyne was already hydrogenated in step 2, this step would not affect the alkyne, making the sequence inconsistent.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with ethyl chloride to form a longer alkyne.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly used for elimination to form a more substituted alkyne.
3. **O₃, H₂O**: Ozonolysis is typically used to cleave double bonds, not alkynes. This step does not align with the alkyne structure.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup after ozonolysis, but the earlier steps do not clearly lead to the target structure.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates and alkylates the alkyne, adding a methyl group.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but the alkyne was fully hydrogenated in step 2, leaving no double bond to cleave. This makes the sequence inconsistent.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, but its role here is unclear without a double bond or alkyne to act on.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which may react with methanol to add a methyl group or form a methyl ether.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly used for elimination to form a double bond.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. If a double bond was formed in step 2, this step could produce aldehyde or ketone groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup after ozonolysis, potentially forming the hydroxymethyl group.

### Conclusion:
Option D provides a plausible sequence for forming the target molecule. The steps involve deprotonation and alkylation, elimination to form a double bond, ozonolysis to cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups, and subsequent workup to form the hydroxymethyl group. While some uncertainties exist, this option aligns most closely with the transformations needed to synthesize the target compound.
