Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two reactions, and we need to find the suitable reagents A and B from the options given. Let me break it down step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O) to produce 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's usually a substitution or addition reaction. Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone. I think the reaction of ketones with CN- (from NaCN) typically leads to the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh right, cyanohydrin formation! So the ketone reacts with a cyanide ion to form a secondary alcohol and a nitrile group.

But wait, how does that happen? The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion on the carbonyl carbon. Since the carbonyl is in a ketone, the attack would form a new carbon-carbon bond with the CN group. Then, probably some proton transfer steps and maybe tautomerism or something.

But looking at the product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts, the CN adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen gets a proton. Wait, but the product has two hydroxyl groups? No, wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or is it (CH2) something else? Wait, but butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile. So the product should be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)C(OH)(CN)CH2CH3? No, wait, butanone is (CH3)2CO. So adding CN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is four carbons, nitrile at the end. So the substituents would be on the second carbon.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is CH2(C(OH)(CH3)CN)CH2? Or wait, maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but wait, butane is four carbons. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but wait, that's actually pentanenitrile. Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but that would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, not butane. Hmm, perhaps I need to rethink the structure.

But regardless, the key point is that the reaction forms a cyanohydrin. For the formation of a cyanohydrin, the reaction conditions are important. The reaction is usually done under acidic conditions. Because the cyanide ion is a good nucleophile, but the ketone is not very reactive towards nucleophilic attack unless the carbonyl is activated. So, I think an acid catalyst is used to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, which helps the CN- attack.

So in the first reaction, butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A. Since NaCN provides the CN-, the A must be the acid catalyst. Which options have A as H3O+? Let's look at the options.

Options:

A) A=H3O+, B=HCl

B) A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH

C) A=NaHSO3, B=HCl

D) A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH

So for the first reaction, A is the acid. So options A and B have A as H3O+, which is a strong acid. Options C and D have NaHSO3, which is a weaker acid, but maybe acting as a source of H+.

Wait, but for cyanohydrin formation, is a strong acid like H3O+ necessary? I think H+ is needed, but it could be provided by other sources as well. But I'm more confident that H3O+ is a common catalyst for such reactions.

So the first step is likely using H3O+ as the acid, which narrows it down to options A and B.

Now, the second reaction. 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. The product is a carboxylic acid. So how does a nitrile become a carboxylic acid? I think this involves hydrolysis. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions to form carboxylic acids or amines, depending on the conditions. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, it's likely that the hydrolysis is done under acidic conditions.

But wait, the reactant is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. Let me think. So, the structure is something like R-O-C≡N, where R is the 4-benzylphenyl group and another substituent.

Wait, no, the structure is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the nitrile is on carbon 4, and the hydroxyl is on carbon 2. Wait, but butane is four carbons, so butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. So 2-hydroxybutanenitrile would be CH2(OH)CH2CH2CN? Or perhaps it's (CH2)2CN with a hydroxyl on the second carbon.

Wait, maybe it's (CH2)2C(OH)CN. No, but wait, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, which implies that the nitrile is on carbon 4, hydroxyl and the benzyl group are on carbon 2.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The main chain is four carbons. The nitrile is on carbon 4 (butanenitrile is R-C≡N where R is CH2CH2CH2-). So the structure would be:

CH2-CH(PhCH2Ph)-CH2-CN? No, wait, but butanenitrile is four carbons: positions 1, 2, 3, 4. Nitrile is on position 4. The hydroxyl group is on position 2, and the 4-benzylphenyl group is also on position 2.

So the structure is CH2-C(OH)(PhCH2Ph)-CH2-CN? Or perhaps:

CH2-CH(OH)(PhCH2Ph)-CH2-CN? Hmm, maybe. But I'm not entirely sure about the structure, but I think that's the gist.

In any case, the key is that the nitrile group is being hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. So the reaction is nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid. The typical conditions for this are either strong acidic or strong basic conditions. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, it's likely that the hydrolysis is done under acidic conditions.

Wait, but I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids using H2O in the presence of an acid catalyst. So, for the second reaction, B is H2O and the reagent is acid.

Looking at the options, when the nitrile is hydrolyzed using H2O and an acid, the acid would be the reagent B. Wait, no. The second reaction says B is H2O, so the other component would be the acid. Wait, the reaction is written as:

[compound] + B (H2O) → product.

So reagent B is H2O, but perhaps the reaction requires another acid or base. Hmm, wait, the reaction is written as the hydrolysis, so perhaps the acid is a catalyst.

Wait, no, the reaction is written as: the reactant plus B, which is H2O. So the reagent is H2O, but the reaction might require another acid or base as a catalyst.

Wait, but in the options, B is the reagent. So in the second reaction, the reagent is H2O, but what else is present? Because the reagent is B, which is H2O. So the other component (like acid or base) is probably part of the conditions.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the notation. Let me read the second reaction again.

The second reaction is written as:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So the reagent is H2O, but perhaps it's part of a hydrolysis reaction that requires an acid or base as a catalyst.

Wait, but for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid, you typically use H2O with an acid catalyst. For example, using H2O under acidic conditions (like H2SO4) or under basic conditions (like with NaOH), but the product would be different. Under acidic conditions, you get the carboxylic acid, under basic you get the carboxylate, which you can then acidify.

So if the reaction is using H2O and an acid, the acid would be the other reagent. So in the options, what is reagent B? Wait, no, in the second reaction, B is the reagent. So the reagent is H2O, but perhaps the condition is acidic.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the question.

The question says, "Select the suitable reagents for the following mentioned reactions."

Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product.

Reaction 2: [compound] + B (H2O) → product.

So for reaction 1, A is the reagent.

For reaction 2, the reagent is B, which is H2O. But perhaps H2O is the solvent, and the actual reagent is an acid or base.

Wait, perhaps in the second reaction, the reagent is H2O, but the reaction is carried out in acidic or basic conditions. So, perhaps the reagent B is H2O, and the acid or base is part of the reaction conditions.

But according to the problem statement, the reagent is B, which is H2O. So maybe the reaction is simply the hydrolysis of the nitrile in water, possibly with an acid or base as a catalyst. But the options give B as either HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, no, looking back, the options are for reagents A and B. The first reaction uses reagent A. The second reaction uses reagent B, which is given as H2O.

Wait, the problem is a bit ambiguous. Let me read the question again.

The question says:

Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product.

Reaction 2: [compound] + B (H2O) → product.

So for reaction 2, the reagent is H2O, but the options list B as either HCl or CH3COOH. Wait, no, looking at the options:

Options:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So for reaction 2, the reagent is B, which in the question is H2O. But in the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH. Hmm, that's confusing. Or perhaps in reaction 2, B is the catalyst. Wait, perhaps the reagents are H2O and another reagent.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the reactions. Let me parse them again.

Reaction 1:

butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product.

So A is the third reagent. So for the cyanohydrin formation, which requires acid (like H+), A is the acid.

Reaction 2:

[compound] + B (H2O) → product.

So the reagent B is H2O, but the reaction also requires an acid or base as a catalyst. But the options give B as HCl or CH3COOH, which are acids. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the second reaction's reagent is B, which is H2O, and the catalyst is something else. Or perhaps the B in the options refers to the catalyst used in reaction 2. But the way the question is phrased, the reagents are A and B for the two reactions.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what each reagent does.

Looking at reaction 2, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. The product is a carboxylic acid. So the reaction is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.

Nitrile hydrolysis can be done in acidic or basic conditions. For acidic hydrolysis, typically H2SO4 is used, and you get the carboxylic acid. For basic conditions, you get the carboxylate, which you can then acidify.

In this case, the product is a carboxylic acid, so the hydrolysis is probably done under acidic conditions. So the reagent in reaction 2 would be an acid, like HCl or CH3COOH.

But in the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH. So reagent B is H2O, but what about the acid? Or perhaps the reaction uses H2O with an acid as a catalyst.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagent for reaction 2 is B, which is H2O plus an acid. But the options give B as HCl or CH3COOH. So perhaps in reaction 2, B is the acid, and H2O is the solvent.

Wait, but the way the question is written is a bit confusing. Let me think again.

The first reaction uses NaCN and A (the reagent), which is the acid catalyst. So for that, A is H3O+ as in options A and B.

The second reaction's reagent is B, which is H2O. But the product is a carboxylic acid, so the hydrolysis must be under acidic conditions. Therefore, the reaction probably uses H2O and an acid. But how does that fit into the options?

Wait, the options list B as HCl or CH3COOH. So in reaction 2, the reagent B is HCl or CH3COOH, and perhaps H2O is the solvent. Then the reaction is hydrolysis of the nitrile to acid using H2O and an acid catalyst.

So for the second reaction, the reagent is B (either HCl or CH3COOH), and the solvent is H2O.

So, for the second reaction to form a carboxylic acid, the hydrolysis must be under acidic conditions. So B must be an acid. Both HCl and CH3COOH are acids, but in different strengths.

But wait, sometimes in hydrolysis reactions, the catalyst is H2SO4, but in the options, the available B are HCl and CH3COOH. So which one would be suitable?

Wait, another thought: the starting material for reaction 2 is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The product is 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile is being converted into a carboxylic acid. But the hydroxyl group is adjacent to the nitrile. So perhaps the reaction isn't a straightforward hydrolysis but involves some kind of oxidation or maybe an intramolecular reaction.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxyl group is part of the structure that could lead to a better leaving group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis where the nitrile is converted into a carboxylic acid, and the hydroxyl group remains as is.

So, it's a nitrile hydrolysis reaction. For that, the conditions would be H2O with acid or base. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, it's likely acid-catalyzed.

So, the reagent would be H2O in the presence of an acid like HCl (B = HCl) or CH3COOH (B = CH3COOH). So options A and C have B = HCl and B = HCl. No, looking back, option A has B = HCl, option C has B=HCl? Let me check the options.

Options:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So for reaction 2, if B is HCl (acid), then the reaction conditions are H2O and HCl, which would provide the acidic environment needed for the hydrolysis.

Alternatively, if B is CH3COOH, that's a weaker acid, but perhaps it's sufficient.

So which acid would be more suitable for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids?

I think that hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be done under acidic conditions, often using H2SO4 as the acid. But since HCl is a strong acid and CH3COOH is a weak acid, which one would work better?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction uses H2O with HCl as a catalyst. So in that case, B would be HCl.

Putting it all together:

Reaction 1 uses H3O+ (A) as the acid catalyst for cyanohydrin formation.

Reaction 2 uses H2O and HCl (B) as the acid for nitrile hydrolysis.

Looking at the options, option A has A=H3O+ and B=HCl. So that would fit.

Wait, but let me double-check the first reaction. If A is H3O+, that would protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic, allowing CN- to attack. So yes, that should form the cyanohydrin.

But wait, another thought: I've read that sometimes, when the ketone is not very reactive, a stronger acid might be needed. But H3O+ is a strong acid, so that should work.

So in reaction 1, the correct reagent A is H3O+. Reaction 2 uses HCl as the acid (reagent B). So option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. Option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl.

But wait, the second reaction's product is a hydroxybutanoic acid. If the hydroxyl group is adjacent to the carboxylic acid, would that cause any issue? I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the second reaction requires a different condition. Wait, another approach: what if in reaction 2, the nitrile is converted to an amide first, then hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid? No, that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the second reaction is a hydrolysis of a secondary nitrile. Wait, but I think the conditions are still acidic H2O.

So, putting it all together, the correct reagents are A=H3O+ and B=HCl, which is option A.

Wait, but wait another point: in the second reaction, is there any other functional group that could interfere? The compound has a hydroxyl group and a nitrile. When hydrolyzing the nitrile, do we need to consider the acidity of the hydroxyl group? Hmm, perhaps the hydroxyl is deprotonated, but in acidic conditions, it would be protonated. Alternatively, maybe the hydroxyl is part of the structure that might not react under these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxyl is part of a more complex structure, but in any case, the nitrile is being hydrolyzed.

So, the options point to option A being the correct choice.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves two reactions, and the goal is to identify the suitable reagents (A and B) from the given options. Let us analyze each reaction and the options systematically.

### Reaction 1:
**butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**

This reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin, which typically occurs via nucleophilic addition of cyanide (CN⁻) to the carbonyl group of a ketone. For this reaction to proceed efficiently, an acid catalyst is required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic and facilitating the attack by CN⁻. Among the options, the acid catalyst for reaction 1 is **A**, which must be a strong acid like H₃O⁺. Options A and B (where A = H₃O⁺) are therefore viable candidates.

### Reaction 2:
**2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**

This reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH) in the presence of water (H₂O). Nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid typically requires acidic or basic conditions. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, the reaction must proceed under acidic conditions. The reagent **B** in this reaction is explicitly stated to be H₂O, but the acidic catalyst must also be considered. Among the options, **B** can be either HCl or CH₃COOH. Strong acids like HCl are generally more effective for this type of hydrolysis compared to weaker acids like CH₃COOH.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  - Reaction 1: H₃O⁺ is a suitable acid catalyst for cyanohydrin formation.  
  - Reaction 2: HCl is a strong acid, making it suitable for nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.  
  - This option is valid.

- **Option B:** A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  - Reaction 1: H₃O⁺ is suitable for cyanohydrin formation.  
  - Reaction 2: CH₃COOH is a weaker acid and less effective for nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid compared to HCl.  
  - This option is less favorable.

- **Option C:** A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  - Reaction 1: NaHSO₃ is not a strong acid and is not suitable for cyanohydrin formation.  
  - Reaction 2: HCl is suitable for nitrile hydrolysis.  
  - This option is invalid due to the unsuitability of A.

- **Option D:** A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  - Reaction 1: NaHSO₃ is not a strong acid and is not suitable for cyanohydrin formation.  
  - Reaction 2: CH₃COOH is a weaker acid and less effective for nitrile hydrolysis.  
  - This option is invalid.

### Conclusion:
The most suitable reagents are **A = H₃O⁺** for reaction 1 and **B = HCl** for reaction 2, which corresponds to **Option A**.
