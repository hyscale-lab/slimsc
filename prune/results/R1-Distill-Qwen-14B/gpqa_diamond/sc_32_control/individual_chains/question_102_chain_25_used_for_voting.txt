Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about a genetic construct and why the eGFP isn't showing up in the mice. Let me read through the problem again and take it step by step.

So, the setup is that there's a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets for binding.

The construct is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two genes in one vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter. The receptor has an IRES upstream of it. 

Between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop cassette with loxP. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP is a stop cassette with lox2272. So I'm thinking that the stop cassettes are used to control expression. 

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested expression via Western blot. Total proteins proportional to actin, so loading is correct. But when they breed the mouse model, which is homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background, and cross them with SOX10-Cre mice, the offspring don't show a green signal under the microscope. The green would come from eGFP, so the receptor-eGFP isn't expressed or isn't fluorescent.

Wait, but the construct is in a lox-Cre system. SOX10-Cre is probably a tissue-specific Cre line. SOX10 is important in neural crest development, so the Cre would be active in neural crest cells. The Cre would recombine the lox sites. 

Looking at the vector, the ligand is first, with a stop in a loxP cassette, followed by the receptor with a stop in lox2272. I think the loxP and lox2272 are different sites, so maybe they're used for different recombination events. 

In a bicistronic vector with IRES, I remember that the IRES allows the second gene (receptor) to be expressed from the same promoter as the first (ligand), but in a separate reading frame. The IRES drives internal ribosome entry, so the second gene (receptor) can be expressed after the first. But wait, the ligand is under CBA promoter, so that's a promoter for the ligand. The receptor is under the same promoter but via the IRES. 

But wait, the vector is bicistronic, so both ligand and receptor are expressed from the same promoter, with the IRES allowing for the receptor's expression after the ligand's. So, the ligand is under CBA promoter, followed by the IRES, then the receptor. 

But the stop cassettes complicate this. The ligand's ORF is followed by a stop with loxP. So, without recombination, the presence of that stop would prevent the ligand from being expressed with mCherry? Or is it the other way around? Wait, the ligand ORF is fused to mCherry. So, the ligand is followed by a stop. So the construct is: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> stop (loxP) -> mCherry.

Wait, perhaps the setup is that mCherry is under the same promoter as the ligand, but with a stop cassette. Similarly, the receptor is followed by eGFP, but also a stop cassette. So the idea is that in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed as ligand-mCherry, and the receptor is expressed as receptor-eGFP. But with Cre, which recombines the stop cassettes, then the expression can change.

Alternatively, maybe the stop cassettes are used to prevent expression unless Cre is present. So, if there's no Cre, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop, so the ligand isn't expressed. Similarly, the receptor ORF is followed by a stop, so the receptor isn't expressed. But when Cre is introduced, it recombines the lox sites, removing the stops. 

Wait, but in the problem, they have the mouse model homozygous for the construct, so maybe the Cre is introduced into the mice to activate the constructs. They crossed the mice with SOX10-Cre, so the Cre is expressed in neural crest cells (since SOX10 is involved in neural crest development).

So, in the offspring, the Cre would recombine the lox sites. Let's see, the ligand is between CBA promoter and a loxP stop. So if Cre is present, the loxP sites are recombined, and the stop cassette is removed, allowing the ligand to be expressed, and perhaps the mCherry would be expressed as a separate thing? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the ligand and receptor are each in separate cassettes. The bicistronic vector has two cassettes: one for ligand with a stop, and another for receptor with a stop. When Cre is present, it recombines the lox sites, allowing expression of the ligand and receptor.

But in the mouse model, the Cre is SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest cells. So in the neural crest cells, Cre would remove the stops, allowing expression of the ligand (fused to mCherry) and the receptor (fused to eGFP). 

But in the question, they don't see any green signal. So the eGFP isn't being expressed. Why? Possible options are either the construct isn't working, or the expression isn't happening.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Hmm, paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression in the same cells, not signaling between cells. I don't think this explains why eGFP isn't expressed.

Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. Stuck in Golgi would mean it's not trafficked to the cell surface. So, even if it's expressed, maybe it doesn't fluoresce. But the question is about the presence of the construct at all. The western blot would show the presence of the protein regardless of trafficking. Wait, but the question says that the Western blot was done after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture. So perhaps the construct is being expressed in astrocytes, but when they use the mouse model, which is crossed with SOX10-Cre, the expression is in neural crest derivatives.

Wait, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. So the construct is present in all cells. Then, when crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre is active in the neural crest cells, which might become, say, astrocytes or other derivatives.

But the problem is that in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed. So perhaps the construct isn't being recombined correctly, so the receptor isn't expressed.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. That would mean they aren't expressed because the promoter isn't sufficient. But the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter. Unless the enhancer is needed for proper expression, but the CBA promoter is constitutive. So maybe this isn't the case.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. So the ORF for receptor is followed by eGFP, but if the stop cassette isn't removed correctly, perhaps the eGFP isn't expressed. Or, if the ORF is not in frame, then the receptor-eGFP might not be expressed correctly. Alternatively, if the frame is wrong, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the stop codon would come before.

Wait, the vector has the receptor ORF at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. So the construct is receptor-eGFP. If there's a stop cassette before eGFP, and the stop is in lox2272, then Cre would remove the stop, allowing eGFP to be expressed. But if the stop isn't removed, then eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

In the mouse, they crossed to SOX10-Cre, which would express Cre in neural crest cells. So, the Cre should recombine the lox sites. However, the lox sites are different between ligand and receptor: ligand has loxP, receptor has lox2272. So, when Cre is present, it would only recombine the loxP and lox2272 sites.

Wait, maybe the vector has the ligand in a loxP cassette and the receptor in a lox2272 cassette. So, perhaps the presence of Cre would remove the stop cassettes, allowing expression of both ligand and receptor.

But in the mouse, they're not seeing green. So why is the receptor-eGFP not expressed? Maybe the Cre isn't active, or the lox sites aren't recombined correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector's expression is such that only one of the two ORFs is expressed.

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic construct. The ligand is at 5', under CBA promoter, and the receptor is at 3' after an IRES. So, the CBA promoter drives the expression of the ligand, and the IRES allows for internal initiation of the receptor's translation.

But between ligand and mCherry is a stop in a loxP cassette, and between receptor and eGFP is a stop in lox2272.

So, without Cre, the ligand is expressed as ligand-mCherry? Or not? Because the stop is after ligand. Wait, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop in loxP. So, without Cre, the ligand would be expressed as ligand, and mCherry would not because the stop is in place. Similarly, the receptor would be expressed as receptor and then a stop, so eGFP wouldn't be expressed. 

But when Cre is present, it would remove the stop cassettes. So ligand would be expressed as ligand, and mCherry would be expressed as a separate thing? Or ligand-mCherry as a fusion? Wait, the ligand ORF is fused to mCherry. So the stop is after the ligand ORF. So in the absence of Cre, the mCherry would not be expressed because the stop is in place. When Cre recombines the loxP, the stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, the receptor's stop is removed, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

But in the experiment, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct, meaning the construct is present in all cells. They cross with SOX10-Cre, which should activate Cre in SOX10-expressing cells (neural crest derivatives). So in those cells, Cre would remove the loxP and lox2272 stops, allowing mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

But the experiment shows no green signal. So the eGFP isn't being expressed. Why?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the ORF for the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, then the eGFP might not be expressed. Alternatively, the stop cassette removal may not have happened correctly because of incorrect lox sites, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the ligand is at 5', with a loxP stop before mCherry. The receptor is at 3', with a lox2272 stop before eGFP. Cre can recombine loxP and lox2272 sites. So, in the presence of Cre, the stops are removed.

But in the mouse, the construct is in a homozygous state. So Cre is active, so the stops should be removed. If the stops weren't removed, then eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But why wouldn't the stops be removed?

Wait, perhaps the vector isn't correctly set up. Like, the lox sites are in the wrong orientation. Or perhaps the vector uses loxP sites that require Cre for removal, but the design is such that the stops can't be removed, leading to no expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed so that the ligand and receptor are in separate cassettes, each with their own stop. So, in the absence of Cre, both stops are present, so no expression. When Cre is present, it would remove the stops, allowing expression.

But in the case of the mouse, the construct is homozygous, but the Cre is only present in the SOX10-Cre mice. So perhaps the mouse's own Cre isn't active in the cells being looked at. Wait, but the SOX10-Cre is hemizygous. So the offspring would be heterozygous for the Cre, but Cre is active in the same cells as SOX10.

Wait, but the problem says that the mouse model is homozygous for the construct, so the construct is present. The cross is with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. So the offspring would have the construct and one copy of SOX10-Cre. Therefore, in the neural crest cells, SOX10 is expressed, so Cre is active, leading to recombination.

But perhaps the construct isn't being recombined because Cre isn't active in the right cells, or the vector's design is flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop cassette isn't removed. So the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. But the Western blot after transfecting the plasmid showed expression. Wait, the Western blot was done in primary astrocyte culture. So perhaps in astrocytes, the construct isn't recombined, but in the mouse, it should be. Alternatively, the Western blot was only for the plasmid construct, not the mouse.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working correctly. The receptor is under the IRES, which requires that the ribosome can translate it. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor wouldn't be expressed. But that would have shown up in the Western blot as well.

Wait, the Western blot was after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocytes. So in that case, the construct is in astrocytes, which probably don't have Cre. So the stops are in place, so only the ligand is expressed as ligand, and the receptor as receptor. Then, the Western blot would show ligand and receptor, but not mCherry or eGFP.

But in the mouse, which has Cre, the stops should be removed, allowing eGFP and mCherry to be expressed. But in the question, the mouse's offspring are visualized under confocal, and no green is observed. So why no eGFP?

Wait, another possibility: The vector's bicistronic construct uses the IRES, which allows the receptor to be expressed after the ligand. But the IRES is after the ligand ORF. So, if the ligand is expressed, the IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed as well. But if the stop cassettes are in place, maybe the IRES isn't functional.

Alternatively, perhaps the way the vector is set up, the receptor is not being expressed because the stop cassette isn't removed.

Wait, looking at the options again, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would cause a frameshift, so the eGFP isn't expressed because the ORF is messed up. But the way the vector is described, the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. So if the stop is between them, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed unless the stop is removed. So if the stop isn't removed, eGFP isn't expressed. But in the mouse, which has Cre, the stop should be removed, so eGFP should be expressed.

Wait, but what if the lox sites are in the wrong orientation? For example, if the lox sites are in a way that when Cre is added, the stop isn't removed but maybe another configuration happens. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is not being translated because the stop is after the receptor ORF. So, without the stop being removed, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, the vector is ligand (with loxP stop) followed by mCherry, and receptor (with lox2272 stop) followed by eGFP. So, I'm thinking that the ligand and mCherry are on one cassette, and the receptor and eGFP on another. So when Cre is present, it would remove both stops, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

But in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed. So maybe the stop cassette for the receptor-eGFP wasn't removed. Why?

Looking at the options:

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the ORF is not in frame, meaning the eGFP is not correctly fused, then maybe the eGFP isn't expressed. But how would that happen? Only if the stop wasn't removed, but the presence of a frame shift would prevent proper expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't functioning correctly, so the receptor isn't expressed. But then why would the eGFP not be expressed? Because the receptor isn't being made.

Wait, another angle: the vector is designed in such a way that without Cre, the ligand and receptor are expressed, but without the fluorescent proteins. With Cre, the fluorescent proteins are expressed. So in the mouse, which has Cre, the fluorescent proteins should be expressed.

But the problem says that when they cross the mouse with SOX10-Cre, they don't see green. So it's possible that the stop wasn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Why wouldn't the stop be removed? Maybe because the Cre isn't active, but the SOX10-Cre should be active in neural crest cells.

Wait, another thought: the vector might have the lox sites in the wrong orientation. For example, lox2272 is a variant of loxP, but it requires Cre to recombine. So perhaps the vector has lox2272 in a way that it's not recognized, or it's in the same orientation as loxP. If the lox sites are in the same orientation, perhaps the stop isn't removed because the recombination isn't happening.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct isn't correctly excised. For example, the presence of lox2272 requires a different Cre variant, but standard Cre should work with lox2272 as well.

Wait, another possibility: the presence of two different lox sites (loxP and lox2272) in the same vector could complicate recombination. Maybe the Cre isn't able to efficiently recombine both sites, leading to incomplete removal of the stops.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's think about the possible options again.

Option A: The ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Not sure how this would affect the eGFP expression.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If it's stuck, maybe the protein isn't on the cell surface, but the western blot would still show the protein. But the question is about fluorescence under the microscope, which depends on proper trafficking. However, the western blot was done on transfected cells, which showed expression. So in the mouse, the eGFP would be expressed but not on the surface. But why wouldn't it traffic? Maybe the eGFP is not correctly processed. But I think this is less likely.

Option C: Enhancer missing. If the enhancer isn't present, the promoter (CBA) might not drive expression. But CBA is a strong constitutive promoter, so this might not be the issue.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP might not be expressed. For example, the stop is before eGFP, or the ORF is shifted. If the stop isn't removed, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But why would the stop not be removed? Because the Cre didn't recombine the lox2272 site.

Wait, perhaps the vector has the receptor followed by lox2272 and then eGFP. So the eGFP is after the lox2272. So when Cre is present, it would remove the lox2272, allowing eGFP to be expressed. But if the lox2272 isn't correctly recombined, the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed.

So why wouldn't the lox2272 be recombined? Maybe the vector wasn't designed correctly, or the Cre isn't active. Alternatively, perhaps the lox sites are in the same orientation, leading to a deletion rather than removal of the stop.

Wait, but in the vector, the stop is between the receptor ORF and eGFP. So the construct is receptor ORF --- stop cassette (lox2272) --- eGFP. So when Cre recombines the lox2272 sites, it would remove the stop, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

But if the lox sites are in a way that when Cre recombines, the stop isn't removed but the eGFP is excluded. For example, if the lox sites are in the same orientation, the region between them would be deleted. So if the stop is in between, deleting that would leave receptor ORF next to eGFP. But that would actually bring them together, possibly in frame. Hmm, but that depends on the exact setup.

Alternatively, if the lox sites are in opposite orientations, the recombination would cause the surrounding sequences to be excised. So if the stop is between the lox sites, its removal would allow the eGFP to be expressed.

But if for some reason the lox sites aren't recognized, the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem might be that the lox2272 sites aren't recombining, perhaps because of incorrect recognition by Cre.

But I'm not sure. Another angle: The bicistronic vector uses the IRES to allow the receptor to be expressed. But if the ligand's stop is in place, perhaps the IRES isn't functional. Wait, but in the presence of Cre, the stops are removed, so the IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed.

Wait, perhaps the stop cassette between the ligand and mCherry is loxP, and the stop between the receptor and eGFP is lox2272. So, SOX10-Cre would only recombine the lox2272 site, not the loxP. Or vice versa. Or maybe it can't recombine both.

Wait, no, Cre can recombine both loxP and lox2272 sites. So both stops should be removed when Cre is present.

But perhaps the lox sites are arranged in a way that the recombination doesn't remove the stop, but instead causes some other change. For example, if the lox sites are in the same orientation, the region between them is deleted. So if the stop is in the middle, the deletion would remove it, allowing the eGFP to be expressed.

Alternatively, if the lox sites are in opposite orientation, the recombination would result in inversion of the intervening sequence. But that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has a configuration where the stops can't be removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, another thought: the vector is designed as ligand (with loxP stop) and receptor (with lox2272 stop) in separate cassettes. So, the ligand is expressed as ligand, and mCherry is only expressed when the loxP is recombined. Similarly, the receptor is expressed as receptor, and eGFP only when lox2272 is recombined.

But when you have a bicistronic vector, perhaps the expression of the second gene (receptor) is dependent on the IRES. So if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor isn't expressed, regardless of the stop.

Wait, but the IRES is after the ligand. So when the ligand is expressed, the IRES should allow the receptor to be expressed as well. But if the stop is present, perhaps the IRES isn't functional. So, the presence of the stop (before mCherry and eGFP) might interfere with the IRES function.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassettes are in the way of the IRES, preventing the receptor from being expressed.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to think about each option again.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. So maybe the eGFP isn't being expressed because the ORF is not in frame. So even if the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't correctly translated.

But how would the frame be off? The eGFP is fused to the receptor's C-terminus. So the ORF would be receptor followed by eGFP in frame.

Wait, perhaps the vector has the receptor ORF followed by a stop in a lox2272 cassette, then eGFP. So in the absence of Cre, the eGFP isn't expressed. When Cre is present, the stop is removed, and eGFP is expressed. But if the ORF of the receptor and eGFP are not in the same frame, then the eGFP wouldn't be correctly expressed.

So if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. If the stop is removed but the ORF isn't in frame, the eGFP might not be expressed either.

But why would the ORF not be in frame? Perhaps during the cloning process, the eGFP was inserted without maintaining the correct reading frame, leading to a frameshift. So even after the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't correctly expressed, leading to no green signal.

That seems plausible. So the most likely option is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question revolves around a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand and receptor pair in neural crest cells. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, followed by a stop cassette with loxP, and fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, preceded by an IRES element and followed by a stop cassette with lox2272, and fused to eGFP. The construct is introduced into a mouse model homozygous for the vector, which is then crossed with SOX10-Cre mice to activate Cre recombinase in neural crest-derived cells. Despite this, no green signal from eGFP is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on neighboring cells. However, the question focuses on the expression of the receptor-eGFP construct within the same cells, not on signaling between cells. This does not explain why eGFP is not expressed.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi apparatus, it would still be synthesized but not trafficked to the cell surface. However, the Western blot performed after plasmid transfection showed expression of the proteins, indicating that the receptor and eGFP are being synthesized. This makes it unlikely that the issue is with trafficking to the Golgi.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. The absence of an enhancer would typically reduce expression, but the Western blot showed expression of the proteins after transfection, suggesting that the promoter is functional. This makes this option less likely.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   The vector design places the receptor ORF followed by a stop cassette (lox2272), which is removed by Cre to allow eGFP expression. If the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, the eGFP would not be correctly translated, even if the stop cassette is removed. This could explain the lack of green signal, as the eGFP would not be properly expressed. This is the most plausible explanation.

### Conclusion:
The most likely reason for the absence of the green signal is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, leading to improper translation of eGFP even after the stop cassette is removed by Cre recombinase.

**Answer: D**
