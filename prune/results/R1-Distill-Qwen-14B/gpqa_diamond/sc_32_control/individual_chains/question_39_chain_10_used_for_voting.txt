Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try.

The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, and the particle was only found between x=1 and x=3 when measured. So the wave function must be non-zero (or have a significant probability) only in that region.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So the probability of finding the particle in a region is the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx over that region. Since the measurements didn't find any particles outside x=1 to x=3, that suggests that the wave function is zero outside this region. But wait, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that seems to be a complex function.

Wait, but the wave function should be zero outside the region where the particle exists, right? Because the particle isn't found elsewhere. So maybe the wave function is given as zero for x <1 and x>3, but it's given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i between 1 and 3? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The question states that each particle's wave function in the part of space where it can exist is given as that expression. So maybe that's the entire wave function, but we have to normalize it so that the probability is 1 between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me note that i is the imaginary unit. So ψ(x) is a complex function. The modulus squared is |ψ|² = (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2. Because when you take the absolute value squared of a complex number a + ib, it's a² + b². So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, the wave function must be normalized. The integral of |ψ|² from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. Because the particle is found only in that interval, the probability outside is zero. So that's the normalization condition.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Wait, but if I'm integrating this, I'll have to split it into two terms. Let me write that out.

Integral from 1 to 3 of (a²)/(1+x) dx + integral from 1 to 3 of 0.25 dx = 1.

Let me compute each integral separately.

First integral: ∫ (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. Let me make substitution u = 1+x, du = dx. When x=1, u=2; x=3, u=4.

So that becomes a² ∫(1/u) du from 2 to 4. The integral of 1/u is ln(u), so a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Wait, because ln(4) is 2 ln(2) and ln(2) is ln(2), so subtracting gives ln(2).

So the first integral is a² * ln(2).

The second integral is ∫0.25 dx from 1 to 3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So adding the two integrals: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Wait, what's ln(2) approximately? ln(2) is about 0.6931. So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.72. So a² ≈ 0.72, so a would be sqrt(0.72) ≈ 0.8485. Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So is this the entire wave function only between x=1 and x=3? Because if it's zero outside, then the normalization is correct. But wait, the question says the wave function in the part of space where it can exist is given as that expression. So perhaps the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So the integral would be correct.

Alternatively, maybe the wave function is non-zero only within 1<x<3, so that the normalization is just the integral I computed.

So calculating a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.72. Square root of 0.72 is approximately 0.8485, which is about 0.85. So option B is 0.85.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: perhaps the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) multiplied by some function that is 1 between 1 and 3 and 0 elsewhere. But the way the question is phrased, it says the wave function is that expression in the part of space where it can exist. So maybe the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i for x between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise. So the normalization is over that interval.

So yeah, I think my initial approach is correct. So a should be approximately 0.85, so option B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \). The particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), meaning the wave function is zero outside this interval. The probability density is proportional to \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), which is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The wave function must be normalized, so the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over the interval \( [1, 3] \) must equal 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \):  
   Using the substitution \( u = 1+x \), \( du = dx \), the limits change from \( x=1 \) (\( u=2 \)) to \( x=3 \) (\( u=4 \)).  
   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_2^4 \frac{1}{u} du = a^2 \left[\ln(u)\right]_2^4 = a^2 (\ln(4) - \ln(2)) = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \):  
   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
   \]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.72 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.72} \approx 0.8485.
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 0.85 \), so the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
