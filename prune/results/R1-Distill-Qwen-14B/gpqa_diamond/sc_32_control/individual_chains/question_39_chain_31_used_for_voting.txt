Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again and try to understand what it's asking.

The problem says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. The i here is the imaginary unit, right? So the wave function is complex. And when they measure the position of the particles, none are found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So all the particles are confined between x=1 and x=3.

The question is asking for the value of 'a'. The options are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

Hmm, I remember that for a wave function to be physically valid, it must satisfy a few conditions. One of them is that it must be normalizable, meaning the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Because the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, that's the region we need to consider.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. That's a complex function. Oh wait, maybe I should express it as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse that again. The wave function is (a divided by the square root of (1 + x)) minus 0.5 times i. So ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x)))] - 0.5i. Is that correct? Or maybe it's a/(sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by (1 -0.5i), but the way it's written might be a minus. Hmm, the way it's written, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] - 0.5i. But wait, that can't be right because a is a constant, so the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. Wait, no, that's not correct because the way it's written, the entire expression would be a complex number. So if we have ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, that would be a function where the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. But that would mean that the wave function is the same everywhere except for the imaginary part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because if the wave function is ψ(x) = real part plus (i times imaginary part), and here, the real part depends on x, while the imaginary part is a constant. Hmm, but when you have a wave function, the real and imaginary parts can vary with x. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the expression. Let me read it again.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by (-0.5i). So ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) * (-0.5i) = -0.5i a / sqrt(1+x). That would make ψ purely imaginary. But the question says the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) minus 0.5i. Wait, that would mean ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] - 0.5i. So ψ(x) has a real part that depends on x and an imaginary part that's constant. But that seems a bit odd because the modulus squared (which we use for probability) would involve both. But wait, maybe this is a typo, and the wave function is actually a multiplied by (1/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i). So ψ(x) = a [1/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i]. That would make more sense, perhaps. But the way it's written is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is a/(sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i). So ψ(x) = a (1 - 0.5i) / sqrt(1+x). That would make it a complex function where both real and imaginary parts vary with x. But the way the question is written, it's a bit unclear. Wait, perhaps the correct expression is ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i), which would make the wave function a complex function where the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is (-0.5a)/(sqrt(1+x)). But I'm not sure; maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5i), which would have the real part varying with x and the imaginary part being a constant. But that seems a bit unusual, so perhaps I need to clarify that.

Well, perhaps the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, meaning ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1+x)] + (-0.5i). So the real part is a / sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So in any case, this wave function is valid only between x=1 and x=3. But wait, if the wave function is zero outside this region, that's the case here because when x is less than 1 or greater than 3, the probability is zero. But the given wave function is defined as this expression in the region where the particles can exist, which is between 1 and 3.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So if x is between 1 and 3, 1 + x is between 2 and 4. So sqrt(1+x) is between sqrt(2) and 2. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), which depends on x, and the imaginary part is -0.5, a constant. So the wave function is a complex function, but the imaginary part is a constant, so the entire function is ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] - 0.5i.

But for the wave function to be normalizable, the integral of |ψ|^2 dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. Because the wave function is zero outside that region.

So |ψ(x)|² is [ (a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2 + (0.5)^2 ], because the modulus squared of a complex number a + ib is a² + b².

Wait, no: ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + (-0.5i), so the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So |ψ(x)|² is [ a²/(1+x) ) ] + (0.5)^2. Because (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx equals 1.

So the integral ∫ (a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ) dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Let me compute this integral.

First, split the integral into two parts:

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 + integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3.

Compute each part separately.

The first integral: ∫ a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x) + C.

So the first integral becomes a² [ ln(1+3) - ln(1+1) ) ] = a² ( ln(4) - ln(2) ) = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

The second integral: ∫ 0.25 dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1) )= 0.25*2=0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So set up the equation: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Solving for a²: a² = (1 - 0.5) / ln(2) = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute 0.5 / ln(2). Let me compute ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849. Let me compute this more accurately. 0.85 squared is 0.7225, which is just a bit higher than 0.7213. So sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking back at the options:

Option B is 0.85.

So the correct answer should be B) 0.85.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

This is a complex function, where the real part is \( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} \) and the imaginary part is constant (\(-0.5\)). For the wave function to be physically valid, it must be normalizable, meaning the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over the region \( x \in [1, 3] \) must equal 1. The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. **First term**: \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \)

   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Therefore:

   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3 = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second term**: \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \)

   This is straightforward:

   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
   \]

Combining both terms, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{1 - 0.5}{\ln(2)} = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

This value is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
