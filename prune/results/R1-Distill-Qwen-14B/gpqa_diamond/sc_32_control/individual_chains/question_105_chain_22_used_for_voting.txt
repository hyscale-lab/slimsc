Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's read through the question again and break it down. Hmm, the question is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of spots on it affects the observed brightness variations. The scenario is similar to an exoplanet causing a transit, so I need to figure out what size a planet would need to be to produce the same brightness change as the spots.

The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, right? So R_star is the same as R_sun. The star's effective temperature is 6000K. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. Oh wait, filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered, so 20% of one hemisphere is spotted. Wait, no, actually the question says one hemisphere is covered, so the filling factor is 20% for that hemisphere. So total area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere.

Each spot is cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000K. So the spot temperature is 6000 - 1000 = 5000K? Or maybe the spot is 1000K hotter? Wait, dark spots are cooler, so probably the spot is at 5000K.

The question says that when the star isn't covered by spots, what planet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve. So, I think they are comparing two scenarios: one where spots are present and causing the brightness variation, and another where the same variation is caused by a planet transiting the star.

Wait, but wait. When a planet transits, it blocks some light, causing a dip in brightness. The dip's amplitude depends on the area blocked, which is the area of the planet divided by the area of the star. But in this case, the spots are causing a variation because as the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, changing the observed flux.

So the star's brightness fluctuates because the spots are on one hemisphere, and when that side is facing us (as the star rotates), the brightness is lower. The amplitude of this variation is what we'd compare to a planet's transit.

Hmm, I think I need to calculate the change in flux due to the spots and then find what planet area would cause the same change.

First, let's model the star as a blackbody. The total flux from the star is the sum of flux from all its surface elements. The spots are cooler, so they contribute less flux.

The star's total surface area is 4πR². The hemisphere that has spots is 2πR². The filling factor is 20%, so the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². Wait no, wait. If it's one hemisphere, and the filling factor is 20% for that hemisphere, then the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². That's the total area of the spots.

The rest of the hemisphere (80%) is normal, so that's 0.8 * 2πR² = 1.6πR². And the other hemisphere (2πR²) is completely normal.

So when the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is the sum of the flux from the spots and the flux from the rest of the star.

Flux from the spots: area of spots (0.4πR²) times their flux per unit area. The flux per unit area for a blackbody is σT^4. Spots are at 5000K, so flux from spots is 0.4πR² * σ*(5000)^4.

The rest of the star's surface (normal areas): the non-spotty parts of the spotty hemisphere (1.6πR²) plus the entire other hemisphere (2πR²). So total normal area is 1.6πR² + 2πR² = 3.6πR². Their flux is 3.6πR² * σ*(6000)^4.

So the total flux when the spotty side is visible is F_spotty = [3.6πR² * (6000)^4 + 0.4πR² * (5000)^4 ] * σ.

When the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_clean = [3.6πR² * (6000)^4 + 2πR² * (6000)^4 ] * σ. Wait no, wait, when the star rotates, the spotty hemisphere is on the other side. So in that case, the entire star's surface is at 6000K except the spots which are hidden. Wait, no, that's not correct. The spots are on the hemisphere, so when the hemisphere is not facing us, the spots are on the far side. So the flux in that case would be all the star's surface except the spots. Wait no, because the spots are on the facing hemisphere. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, when the star's spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots are visible, contributing less flux. When it's not facing us, the spots are on the far side, so we see the rest of the star's surface, which is all at 6000K except for the spots that are not visible. Wait no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the star's surface is divided into two hemispheres: one with spots (20% of its area) and one without. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots. When the other hemisphere is facing us, we don't see the spots, but the spots are on the far side. So the observed flux in that case is the entire star's surface at 6000K minus the spots, which are on the other side and hence not affecting our view. Wait, no— when the other hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the back, so their flux isn't seen. So the flux when clean is the total flux without the spots, which would be the same as the star's total flux without any spots.

Wait, I think I need to model the star's flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible and when it's not.

The total flux without any spots would be F_total = 4πR² * σ * (6000)^4.

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotty = (3.6πR² * (6000)^4) + (0.4πR² * (5000)^4). Because in this hemisphere, 20% is spots and 80% is normal. The other hemisphere is all normal, but since it's the same as the spotty hemisphere, wait no—the entire star is split into two hemispheres, one with spots covering 20% of its area, and the other without. So the total surface area is 4πR².

Wait, no. The star's surface area is 4πR². One hemisphere (so 2πR²) has spots covering 20% of its area, which is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the spotty hemisphere has 0.4πR² of spots and 1.6πR² of normal surface. The other hemisphere has no spots, so it's 2πR² of normal surface.

So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the observed flux is (1.6πR² + 2πR²) * (6000)^4 * σ + 0.4πR² * (5000)^4 * σ. Wait, no. Because the spotty hemisphere's 1.6πR² is the non-spotted part. So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

Flux = (1.6πR² * (6000)^4) + (0.4πR² * (5000)^4) + (2πR² * (6000)^4)) * σ.

Wait, no, because the 2πR² is the other hemisphere, which is entirely normal. So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

Flux = [ (1.6πR² + 2πR²) * (6000)^4 ) + (0.4πR² * (5000)^4) ] * σ.

Wait, that's 3.6πR² * (6000)^4 + 0.4πR² * (5000)^4.

When the spotty hemisphere is not facing us (i.e., the other hemisphere is facing us), the flux is:

Flux = [2πR² * (6000)^4 (from the non-spotty hemisphere) ) + (because the spotty hemisphere is on the other side, but the spots are on that side. However, since we can't see them, their flux isn't part of the total observed flux. So the observed flux is the flux of the non-spotted parts of the visible hemisphere, but the visible hemisphere is the one without spots. So in this case, the visible hemisphere is entirely normal, so 2πR² * (6000)^4, plus the other hemisphere which is the spotty one, but since it's not visible, its flux isn't counted. So no—wait, no. No, when the other hemisphere is facing us, the spotted hemisphere is on the back, so we don't see any of its surface. So the observed flux is just the 2πR² (the visible hemisphere) times (6000)^4, plus the flux from the back hemisphere's normal parts, but wait, no—because the back hemisphere's surface isn't visible, so we don't see any of it. Wait, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the star as having a certain fraction of its surface at a lower temperature. The total flux is the sum of the flux from all visible parts.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the star as having a certain average flux. The presence of spots will cause the flux to dip when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

So when the star is in the state where the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotty. When it's the other way, the flux is F_clean.

The difference between F_spotty and F_clean would be the variation in brightness we observe.

Wait, let's compute F_clean and F_spotty.

F_clean is when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us. So the visible area is 2πR², all at 6000K. So F_clean = 2πR² * σ*(6000)^4.

Wait, no. Wait, the total flux from the star is when all areas are visible. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the total flux when the star is viewed from a particular side.

Wait, another approach: The star has a total surface area of 4πR². The spots cover 0.2 of one hemisphere (2πR²), so the area of spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the rest of the star's surface is 4πR² - 0.4πR² = 3.6πR², which is at 6000K. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the spots are only on one hemisphere. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, we see 0.4πR² of spots and 1.6πR² of normal plus the other hemisphere (2πR²) of normal.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Another way: think of the star as having a fraction f of its surface covered by spots. f is 0.2 for one hemisphere, which is 0.1 of the entire star's surface. Because one hemisphere is half the surface area, and 20% of that is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 of the total area. So the filling factor for the entire star is 20% of one hemisphere, which is 10% (0.1) of the total surface.

Hmm, maybe that's a better approach. Let me think.

Total surface area = 4πR².

Filling factor f = 0.2 for the spotty hemisphere, which is 2πR². So spots cover 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the fraction of the total surface area covered by spots is (0.4πR²)/(4πR²) ) = 0.1, so 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots.

So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the visible surface is 2πR² of which 0.4πR² is spots, and 1.6πR² is normal. The other 2πR² is the far side, all at 6000K.

So the total flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is:

F_spotty = [ (1.6πR² + 2πR²) * (6000)^4 + 0.4πR² * (5000)^4 ] * σ

= [3.6πR² * (6000^4) + 0.4πR²*(5000^4)] * σ

When the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, the visible surface is 2πR², all at 6000K, and the other hemisphere (spotty) is on the far side. So the flux from the visible side is 2πR²*(6000^4) * σ. The far side (spotty) is not visible, so its flux isn't contributing. Wait, no—no. Because the star is a sphere, when you look at the star, you see all the light from the surface that is facing you, regardless of the other side. Wait, no, that's not right. No, when the star is viewed from Earth, you see only the hemisphere facing us, the other side is obscured. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, we see its flux. When the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, we see that hemisphere's flux.

Wait, that's correct. So the flux when the spotty hemisphere is facing us is F_spotty = (1.6πR² + 2πR²) * (6000)^4 σ + 0.4πR² * (5000)^4 σ.

Wait, let me compute F_spotty and F_clean.

F_spotty = (3.6πR²) * (6000^4) * σ + 0.4πR²*(5000^4)*σ.

F_clean = when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us. So the visible area is 2πR², all at 6000K. So F_clean = 2πR² * (6000^4) * σ.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the other hemisphere is the spotty one, but when the non-spotty is facing us, we don't see the spotty hemisphere's spots because they're on the back. So the flux from the spotty hemisphere is not seen, but the front is all normal. So F_clean is 2πR² * (6000^4) * σ. Because the other hemisphere (spotty) is not visible. So the total flux when clean is that.

But wait, when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, we see 1.6πR² (normal) in that hemisphere, plus 2πR² (other hemisphere, all normal), and 0.4πR² (spots) in the front. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused again. Let me think: the front hemisphere is the spotty one. So front hemisphere area is 2πR². Spot area in front: 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So front has 0.4πR² spots and 1.6πR² normal. The back hemisphere is 2πR², all normal, but when the front is facing us, we don't see the back. So when the front is facing us, the flux is (1.6πR² + 0.4πR² spotted) from the front, and 0 from the back? No, because the back is not visible. So when front is facing, the flux is (normal areas on front) + (spotted areas on front). The back is not visible, so their fluxes are not part of what we observe. Wait, no! Because the front is all that's visible, so the flux is just the front's contribution.

Wait, I'm getting tangled here. Let me try to visualize: when the spotty hemisphere is facing the observer, the observer sees the entire front hemisphere's flux. The back hemisphere's flux is not seen because it's on the other side. So in this case, the front has 0.4πR² spots and 1.6πR² normal. So the observed flux is:

F_spotty = (1.6πR² * 6000^4) + (0.4πR² * 5000^4) ) * σ.

When the non-spotty hemisphere is facing the observer, the front is 2πR² normal, so F_clean = (2πR² * 6000^4 ) * σ.

So the difference between F_clean and F_spotty is the brightness variation. The amplitude is (F_clean - F_spotty) / F_clean.

So let's compute F_clean and F_spotty.

F_clean = 2πR²*(6000^4) * σ.

F_spotty = [1.6πR²*(6000^4) + 0.4πR²*(5000^4)] * σ.

Compute F_spotty:

= πR² [1.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(5000^4) ] * σ.

So the variation amplitude is (F_clean - F_spotty)/F_clean.

Let me compute this:

(F_clean - F_spotty) = [2πR²*(6000^4) * σ ] - [ πR²*(1.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(5000^4)) * σ ]

= πR² * σ [ 2*(6000^4) - 1.6*(6000^4) - 0.4*(5000^4) ]

= πR² σ [ (2 - 1.6) * 6000^4 - 0.4*(5000^4) ]

= πR² σ [ 0.4 * 6000^4 - 0.4 * 5000^4 ]

= 0.4 π R² σ [6000^4 - 5000^4 ].

So the variation is this value. The amplitude as a fraction of F_clean is:

Amplitude = (0.4 πR² σ (6000^4 -5000^4)) / (2πR² σ 6000^4 )

Simplify:

= (0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / (2 * 6000^4 )

= (0.2 (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / (6000^4 )

= 0.2 * [ 1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

Compute (5000/6000) = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(0.8333)^4 ≈ let's compute.

0.8333 squared is approximately (5/6)^2 = 25/36 ≈ 0.6944.

Squared again: (25/36)^2 = 625/1296 ≈ 0.48225.

So (5000/6000)^4 ≈ 0.482.

So [1 - 0.482 ] = 0.518.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.518 ≈ 0.1036.

So the amplitude is about 10.36% of F_clean.

Wait, but wait. The amplitude is the difference between F_clean and F_spotty. So when the star is in the spotty phase, its brightness is lower, so the observed dip is 10.36% of F_clean. But when the star isn't spotted, the dip would come from a planet blocking some of the light. So a planet with radius Rp would block an area of π Rp².

The fraction of the star's area blocked is (π Rp²) / (π Rstar²) ) = (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So the amplitude of the dip caused by the planet would be (Rp/Rstar)^2.

We want this amplitude to be the same as the one caused by the spots, which is approximately 0.1036 (10.36%).

So:

(Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1036.

Take square root:

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1036) ≈ 0.322.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, which is close.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the calculations because I might have made a mistake. Let me compute (5000/6000)^4 more accurately.

Compute 5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333333.

(5/6)^2 = 25/36 ≈ 0.6944444.

(5/6)^4 = (25/36)^2 = 625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1-0.482253 ≈ 0.517747.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.517747 = 0.103549.

So the amplitude is about 10.35% of the clean flux.

So the planet's radius is such that (Rp/Rstar)^2 ≈ 0.1035.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217, which is approximately 0.32. So option D is 0.32.

Wait, but wait another thing. The calculation I did assumed that the amplitude was (F_clean - F_spotty)/F_clean. But in reality, when the star is viewed with the spotty hemisphere, the flux is F_spotty, which is less than F_clean. So the amplitude is the difference compared to the star's normal flux. Alternatively, perhaps I should be comparing to the star's total flux without any spots.

Wait, that's another consideration. Let me think: the star's actual total flux without any spots would be F_total = 4πR² σ (6000^4). But when the spots are present, the flux varies depending on which hemisphere is visible. So when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_clean = 2πR² (6000^4) * σ.

Wait, no. Because when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, we're seeing 2πR² of the star, which is part of the star. The other side (the spotty hemisphere) is not visible, so the star's total flux is F_clean = 2πR² * 6000^4 * σ.

But the star's total flux without spots would have been 4πR² * 6000^4 * σ. So F_clean is only half of the star's total flux without spots. Wait, that can't be right. Because the star's total flux is the sum of all the light it emits, regardless of which side you're viewing. Wait, no—when you view a star, you see the light from the hemisphere facing you. So the star's total emitted light is 4πR² * sigma T^4, but when observed from a distance, you only see the light from the hemisphere facing you, which is 2πR² * sigma T^4, so the observed flux is half of the total emitted flux.

Wait, perhaps I should model the star as having a certain average flux. So when the star is fully unspotted, the observed flux is F0 = 2πR² σ (6000)^4.

But when the star has spots, the observed flux when the spotty side is facing us is F_spotty, which is less than F0. The variation is the difference between F0 and F_spotty.

Wait, but the problem says the star is covered with spots, and we're comparing to the same amplitude as a planet. So perhaps the way I did it before was correct.

Wait, the situation is that the star has spots, and when it rotates, the brightness varies because the spotted hemisphere comes into view. The amplitude of this variation is the same as if a planet were transiting, blocking a certain area.

So in the case of the spot, the dip is (F_clean - F_spotty)/F_clean = 10.35% as I calculated earlier. For the planet, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. We set them equal.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035, so Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.322. So the closest option is D, which is 0.32.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the dip from the planet would be (Rp/Rstar)^2. Let me confirm: when a planet transits, it blocks an area of π Rp², so the fraction is π Rp^2 / (π Rstar^2) ) = (Rp/Rstar)^2. So yes, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should consider the fact that the star's total flux is different when it's spotted. But I think the way I did it, comparing the amplitude to the same as a planet's, is correct.

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with dark spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Parameters and Setup:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The area of the spots is \( 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), and the remaining area of the spotty hemisphere is \( 1.6\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( 1000 \, \text{K} \), so their temperature is \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the total observed flux is:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotty}} = \left( 1.6\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma (6000)^4 + 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma (5000)^4 \right).
     \]
   - When the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, the total observed flux is:
     \[
     F_{\text{clean}} = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma (6000)^4.
     \]
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between \( F_{\text{clean}} \) and \( F_{\text{spotty}} \), normalized by \( F_{\text{clean}} \):
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{F_{\text{clean}} - F_{\text{spotty}}}{F_{\text{clean}}}.
     \]

3. **Calculation of Amplitude**:
   - Substituting the expressions for \( F_{\text{clean}} \) and \( F_{\text{spotty}} \):
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma (6000)^4 - \left( 1.6\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma (6000)^4 + 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma (5000)^4 \right)}{2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma (6000)^4}.
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma \left( 6000^4 - 5000^4 \right)}{2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma (6000)^4}.
     \]
   - Canceling terms:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{0.4 \cdot \left( 6000^4 - 5000^4 \right)}{2 \cdot 6000^4}.
     \]
   - Compute \( (6000/5000)^4 \approx 2.56 \), so \( 6000^4 - 5000^4 = 6000^4 (1 - 1/2.56) \approx 6000^4 \cdot 0.6016 \).
   - Substituting:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 6000^4 \cdot 0.6016}{2 \cdot 6000^4} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.6016}{2} \approx 0.1203 \, (12.03\%).
     \]

4. **Comparison to Exoplanet**:
   - The brightness variation caused by an exoplanet transiting the star is proportional to the area blocked by the planet:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude}_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2.
     \]
   - Setting \( \text{Amplitude}_{\text{planet}} = \text{Amplitude}_{\text{spot}} \):
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1203.
     \]
   - Solving for \( R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1203} \approx 0.347.
     \]

### Final Answer:
The closest option to the calculated value is **0.32**, which corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D
