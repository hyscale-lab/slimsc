Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it properly.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. So, the main structure is a cyclohexane ring, and attached to it is a carbonyl group (the -carbaldehyde part) and another substituent. The substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH group. So, the molecule looks like a cyclohexane ring with a CH2 group that's connected to both a hydroxyl group (OH) and another cyclohexane ring. And then, there's an aldehyde group on the same carbon as the CH2, I think.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So that's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group attached. The ethynyl is a triple bond between two carbons, so it's like -C≡CH attached to the cyclohexane.

I need to figure out the steps to go from ethynylcyclohexane to the target molecule. Let me think about the possible reactions and reagents that can achieve this.

First, ethynylcyclohexane. I remember that alkyne groups can undergo various reactions. One thought is that maybe I can perform a reduction. But wait, what's the goal? The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the formation of a benzyl-type structure. Another idea: maybe the ethynyl group can be converted into an alcohol. Let me think about each option's reagents.

Looking at the options, all of them start with NaNH2 and some chloride. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. When used with alkyl halides, it might be for alkylation, like in an elimination or substitution reaction.

Option A: NaNH2, methyl chloride first. Then H2/Pd, which is hydrogenation. Then Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, and then H2SO4 with HgSO4 and H2O. I'm not too sure about that last part. H2SO4 with HgSO4 sounds like the conditions for a sulfonation, but HgSO4 is also used in oxidation reactions, like in the Jones oxidation. Wait, but the target has an aldehyde group, so maybe oxidation is involved.

Option B: Starts with NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. Then Li and liquid NH3. That's a Birch reduction condition, maybe? Or perhaps it's for alkyne additions. Then O3 and H2O, which is ozonolysis. Then NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent, perhaps for reductive workup.

Option C: First reagent is NaNH2 and methyl chloride again. Then H2 with Pd on calcium carbonate, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation. Then O3 with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup because (CH3)2S is used to prevent over-oxidation. Finally, Ba(OH)2, a strong base.

Option D: Starts with NaNH2 and methanol. Then Li and liquid NH3, which might be for a coupling reaction. Then O3 and (CH3)2S, followed by NH4OH.

Hmm, let's think about the reaction steps needed. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with both a carbonyl group and a CH2OH-cyclohexyl substituent. So, perhaps I need to introduce both substituents into the cyclohexane.

Wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, if I can first functionalize the triple bond, perhaps via a substitution or addition, then proceed to form the necessary groups.

Step 1: Using NaNH2 and a methyl chloride. NaNH2 is a strong base, so maybe this is a deprotonation followed by alkylation. Ethynylcyclohexane has acidic protons on the alkyne. Deprotonating the alkyne would give a cyclohexyl acetylide. Then, methyl chloride would alkylate it. So, the acetylide would attack the methyl chloride, adding a methyl group to the alkyne. Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne (since it's -C≡CH attached to cyclohexane). Deprotonation would give the acetylide, which would then react with methyl chloride (CH3Cl) in an alkylation, leading to a longer alkyne, perhaps (CH3)C≡C-cyclohexane? Or wait, the structure after alkylation would be CH2CH2C≡C. Wait, no, perhaps the acetylide is the cyclohexyl end. So, when methyl chloride is added, the acetylide (nucleophile) would attack the methyl chloride, giving cyclohexylidene methyl or something. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the product.

Alternatively, maybe after alkylation, the ethynyl group becomes a propargyl group. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again: the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached.

Deprotonating with NaNH2 would give the acetylide: cyclohexylacetylide (-C≡C^- Na+ ). Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would react in an SN2 reaction, so the acetylide attacks CH3Cl, adding a methyl group. So, the product would be CH2Cl-C≡C-CH2-cyclohexane? No, wait, no. Wait, the acetylide is at the terminal end.

Wait, no, the acetylide would have the structure [cyclohexane]-C≡C^− Na^+.

Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would react, so the acetylide would attack the methyl, giving [cyclohexane]-C≡C-CH2Cl.

Wait, but that would not be correct because the acetylide has a negative charge on the sp carbon; when it attacks CH3Cl, you get an addition of methyl to the triple bond. So, the product after alkylation would be (cyclohexyl)ethynylmethyl chloride, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it forms a longer alkyne, but perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps this step is for adding a methyl group via a substitution reaction. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is being converted into a vinyl group or something else.

Wait, another possibility: NaNH2 can also be used in elimination reactions. If I have ethynylcyclohexane and treat it with NaNH2, perhaps it deprotonates to form the acetylide, which is a strong base. Then, when methyl chloride is added, the acetylide attacks, leading to an alkylation. So, the product would have a CH2CH3 group attached to the triple bond.

Wait, but the starting material is cyclohexyl-ethynyl. If I add a methyl group to the alkyne, perhaps it becomes cyclohexyl-propynyl?

Wait, perhaps I need to think about other reactions. Maybe the alkyne can be hydrogenated. But let's see the next steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a deprotonation and alkylation to form a longer alkyne, which then undergoes hydrogenation, followed by some functional group transformations.

Let me think about the target: it has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH, which is attached to another cyclohexane ring (the main ring?), and also an aldehyde group.

Wait, maybe the synthesis involves forming a benzyl alcohol group and then oxidizing it. Oh wait, I'm getting a bit lost here.

Another approach: Let's think about each reagent and what they do.

First reagent in all options is NaNH2 and some chloride. So, that's likely an alkylation of the acetylide.

Step 2 in option A is H2/Pd, which is hydrogenation. So, that would reduce the alkyne to an alkane. But wait, H2/Pd usually hydrogenates triple bonds to single bonds. So, if we have an alkyne, it would become an alkane. But wait, if the alkyne is between two carbons, hydrogenation would make it a single bond, so perhaps a cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2- group.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde group. So, perhaps that comes from oxidation of a secondary alcohol.

So, maybe the process is: alkyne → alkene via some reaction → alcohol via addition of water → oxidation to aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to make a longer alkyne, then hydrogenate it to a diol, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first steps are to add two substituents to the cyclohexane. Let me think: the target has two substituents on the main cyclohexane: a carbonyl group and a CH2OH-cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a cyclohexane with a C≡CH group. So, the first step is to add a methyl group to the triple bond.

Wait, if I deprotonate the ethynyl group to form the acetylide, then treat with methyl chloride, the acetylide (strong base) would attack the methyl chloride, giving a longer alkyne. So, the product would be [cyclohexyl]ethynylmethyl chloride, which is (cyclohexyl)propynyl chloride?

Wait, maybe not. Let's think: the alkyne is -C≡CH. Deprotonate to form -C≡C^- Na^+.

Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would react, so the acetylide attacks CH3Cl, leading to -C≡C-CH3, but wait, that would be propargyl group. So, the product would be cyclohexylpropargyl something? Hmm, wait, maybe the product after step 1 is CH2Cl added to the triple bond, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to form a benzyl chloride. Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, not benzyl chloride.

Let me try to think of the steps needed to reach the target. The target has a cyclohexane ring with a CH2-OH group (from a cyclohexyl group) and an aldehyde group. So, perhaps the aldehyde comes from oxidation of a secondary alcohol, and the CH2-OH comes from a substitution or addition.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group can be converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation. But wait, ethynyl oxidation would typically give a ketone or carboxylic acid, depending on conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond can be hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond, then undergo hydroxylation, and then maybe some other steps.

Let me think about the reagents in the options again. Option C's steps: first NaNH2 and methyl chloride, then H2/Pd-calcium carbonate (hydrogenation), then ozonolysis (O3 and (CH3)2S), then Ba(OH)2.

Wait, ozonolysis is used to cleave double bonds. So if after the first two steps, the molecule has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. But the target doesn't have two carbonyls; it has one aldehyde and a hydroxyl group.

Hmm, perhaps another approach: Let's think of the target molecule as having two substituents on a cyclohexane ring. One substituent is an aldehyde group (R-CO-H), and the other is a CH2-OH group attached to another cyclohexane. So, the molecule is:

cyclohexane-C(CH2OH-cyclohexyl)(CHO)

So, perhaps the synthesis involves adding these substituents step by step.

Wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, perhaps the first step is to add a methyl group to the triple bond, making it a longer alkyne. Then, reduce the alkyne to a diol, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans alkene. Then, perform some addition to introduce a hydroxyl group.

Wait, another thought: maybe the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group. For that, oxidation of the alkyne to a ketone would be needed. But I'm not sure which reagents do that.

Wait, the target has a carbonyl group. So, perhaps the starting alkyne is oxidized to a ketone.

Wait, I think that the oxidation of a terminal alkyne (like ethynylcyclohexane) can be done using strong oxidizing agents like O3 (ozone) followed by workup. Or perhaps using a different reagent.

Alternatively, the alkyne can be converted into a ketone via a two-step process: hydrogenation to cis-alkene, then epoxidation, but that doesn't directly give a ketone.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each step in the options.

Looking at option D: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. Wait, methanol is a good nucleophile. But NaNH2 is a strong base. So, perhaps deprotonating the alkyne and then reacting with methanol. But methanol isn't a good electrophile. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a deprotonation followed by alkylation, but with methanol as the electrophile. Hmm, but methanol is not a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the alkyne attacks methanol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to add a methyl group via alkylation. Let's go back to the options.

Option C: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, after alkylation, the alkyne becomes longer. Then, step 2 is H2/Pd-c. So, hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkane. Wait, that would make it a single bond, so the product would be a cyclohexane with a CH2-CH2- group attached. But I'm not sure how that helps.

Wait, perhaps the first two steps are to add a methyl group and then hydrogenate to a single bond.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the target structure again.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main ring is cyclohexane, and one of its carbons is attached to a CH2 group. This CH2 has two substituents: a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. Additionally, the same carbon has a carbonyl group (aldehyde).

Wait, wait, that might not be possible because a carbon can't have four bonds if it's attached to three substituents plus a carbonyl group. Oh wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the structure. Let me parse the name again.

The name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

The main chain is cyclohexane (the parent). The substituents are at position 1 (the first carbon). The substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, the substituent is a CH2 group attached to hydroxy and cyclohexyl.

And the cyclohexane also has a carbaldehyde group, which is an aldehyde (-CHO). So, the main ring has two substituents: the CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl) group and the aldehyde group, both on the same carbon?

Wait, that can't be right because a carbon can't have four bonds if it's attached to three substituents plus a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-OH connected to a cyclohexane, and the aldehyde is on the same carbon.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The main ring is cyclohexane. One carbon (position 1) has two substituents: a CH2OH group (which is connected to a cyclohexane) and an aldehyde group (CHO). So, the carbon in position 1 would be attached to these two groups and two other bonds (to the ring).

Wait, but a carbon in a cyclohexane ring has two bonds to the ring and two substituents. So, in this case, the substituents are a CH2OH-cyclohexyl group and a CHO group. So, the carbon is attached to:

- Two cyclohexane rings (positions in the ring)
- CHO group
- CH2-OH (which is connected to another cyclohexane)

Wait, that makes four bonds, which is possible because it's a tetrahedral carbon.

So, the main steps would involve:

1. Introducing a substituent that would become the aldehyde group.
2. Introducing the CH2-OH-cyclohexyl group.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which has a triple bond attached to the cyclohexane. So, perhaps the triple bond will be used to form the aldehyde group.

One approach is to functionalize the triple bond to become a carbonyl group. To do that, perhaps we can hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis-alkene, then oxidize it to a ketone.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde, not a ketone. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted to a propargyl alcohol, which can then be oxidized.

Wait, another idea: The alkyne could be hydrogenated to a cis or trans alkene. Then, that alkene could be converted into a diol via hydroxylation (like with O3 and then H2O and a workup), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the alkene could be epoxidized and then opened to form diols.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the steps as:

1. Alkyne → alkene via hydrogenation.
2. Alkene → diol via ozonolysis (but that would break the double bond into two carbonyls).
Wait, but ozonolysis usually cleaves double bonds into carbonyls. So maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is first converted into an enol ether or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation.

Wait, another approach: The alkyne can be converted into a benzyl chloride via alkylation, then undergo some kind of substitution or elimination.

Alternatively, let's think about the possible reagents in each option and see which sequence makes sense for the target.

Option C's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation of the acetylide. So, the product would be ethynylcyclohexane with a methyl group added to the triple bond, making it longer. So, perhaps propargylcyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd-c → hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond, so propargyl becomes CH2CH2. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond, so the structure becomes cyclohexane with a CH2CH2 group attached.

Wait, but that would not form any rings. Hmm, maybe that's not the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation adds a methyl group to the triple bond, making a longer alkyne. Then the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkane, but that would just make a longer chain without any functional group.

Hmm. Another approach: Perhaps the first step is to add a methyl group to the alkyne, making the structure CH2Cl-C≡C-cyclohexane. Then, step 2 is hydrogenation, which would convert the triple bond into a single bond, so CH2Cl-CH2-cyclohexane.

Wait, but I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps after alkylation, the alkyne is converted into a ketone. But that might require a different reagent.

Wait, another thought: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to the CH2OH. So, perhaps the ethynyl group can be converted into a cyclohexyl group via some cycloaddition or ring-forming reaction. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into an epoxide, but that's not directly obvious.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne undergoes alkylation to add a methyl group, making a longer alkyne.
2. The alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene.
3. The alkene is then subjected to ozonolysis to form a carbonyl group.
4. Then, some workup to form the alcohol.

Wait, let's see. If the alkyne becomes an alkene after hydrogenation, and then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. But the target only has one aldehyde and a hydroxyl group, so maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene, which is then epoxidized, then opened to form a diol. But again, not sure.

Let me look at option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. Deprotonating the ethynylcyclohexane would form the acetylide. Then, adding methanol. But methanol is a weak electrophile. So, the acetylide would attack the methanol, but methanol isn't a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the acetylide attacks the methyl group from methanol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps this step is for adding a methyl group via alkylation. So, the product after step 1 would be (cyclohexyl)propynyl-methanol or something else. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/Li NH3; then O3/H2O; then NH4OH.

Wait, Li and liquid NH3 is a common condition for Birch reductions, but more importantly, it's used for deprotonation in alkyne chemistry. Alternatively, perhaps it's for alkane to alkyne transformations, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the second step is for a cyclopropanation or some other reaction.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to add an ethyl group, making a longer alkyne.
2. Then, using Li and NH3, perhaps an alkylation or a coupling.
3. Ozonolysis to cleave the alkyne into carbonyl groups.
4. NH4OH for workup.

But I'm not certain.

Let me think of the target again. It has an aldehyde group and a CH2OH group attached to a cyclohexane ring. Maybe the aldehyde comes from oxidizing an alkyne or an alkene.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group can be converted into a carbonyl group. For that, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then oxidized to a ketone. But the target has an aldehyde, not a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is partially hydrogenated to an internal alkyne, then subjected to a hydration reaction to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl via oxymercuration or some other reaction. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Option C:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride: alkylation of the acetylide.
2. H2/Pd-c: hydrogenate alkyne to single bond.
3. O3 and (CH3)2S: ozonolysis with reductive workup.
4. Ba(OH)2: a base, possibly for elimination.

After step 1: the alkyne becomes longer, perhaps CH2Cl attached? Or maybe a longer alkyne. Then, hydrogenation would make a single bond. Then ozonolysis would cleave the single bond, but that doesn't make sense since ozonolysis is for alkenes.

Wait, no. Ozonolysis is for breaking double bonds into carbonyls. So if after step 2, the molecule has a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it. So how would the molecule have a double bond after step 2?

Hmm, if step 1 is alkylation, perhaps the alkyne becomes a longer alkyne, and step 2 is partial hydrogenation to a cis-alkene. Then, step 3, ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. Then, step 4, Ba(OH)2, which is a base, could cause elimination.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde. So, perhaps this sequence is adding carbonyl groups but I'm not sure how that leads to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the steps needed to get the substituents in the right places.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH, which is attached to the main cyclohexane ring. So, perhaps I need to perform a Grignard reaction or some kind of alkylation to add the cyclohexyl group to the main ring.

Wait, but the main ring already exists as cyclohexane. How would adding a cyclohexyl group work?

Wait, maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a benzyl-type group, which can then undergo some coupling or substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group can be converted into an aldehyde. Then, the aldehyde can undergo some kind of addition reaction.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne → alkene via hydrogenation.
2. Alkene → diol via ozonolysis and workup.
3. Diol → aldehyde via oxidation.

But I'm not sure.

Another approach: Let's think of each option's reagents and see which logically leads to the target.

Option C:

After step 1 (alkylation), the alkyne becomes longer. Step 2: hydrogenate to single bond. Now we have a longer chain attached to cyclohexane. Then, step 3: ozonolysis would require a double bond, but step 2 gives a single bond. So, maybe the hydrogenation isn't complete, or perhaps it's a different kind of hydrogenation.

Wait, perhaps step 2 doesn't hydrogenate the alkyne but instead adds hydrogen in a different way. For example, H2 and Pd might hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond. That way, step 3 (ozonolysis) would act on the double bond.

Let me reevaluate step 2 in option C. It's H2/Pd-c. So, that's usually for hydrogenation of triple bonds to single bonds. But if the alkyne was hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, that would require a different catalyst, like Lindlar's catalyst (Pd with quinoline), which gives cis addition. But if the catalyst is Pd without any poison, it would hydrogenate the alkyne all the way to a single bond.

Hmm, so perhaps step 2 in option C is hydrogenating the alkyne to a single bond, which doesn't have a double bond for ozonolysis in step 3. That would be a problem because ozonolysis cleaves double bonds.

Wait, that suggests that option C's step 3 may not make sense because there's no double bond. So, perhaps option C isn't correct.

Looking at option D: Steps are NaNH2 and methanol, then Li and NH3, then O3 and (CH3)2S, then NH4OH.

Methanol as the electrophile in the first step: perhaps the acetylide reacts with methanol to form an aldehyde. Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where the acetylide attacks a methyl group from methanol, but that's not a typical reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a deprotonation and alkylation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is forming a benzyl-type alcohol.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the target and how to get the aldehyde and the CH2OH groups.

The aldehyde group is likely derived from oxidation of a primary alcohol. So, perhaps one of the steps involves introducing a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

The CH2OH group attached to a cyclohexane suggests that perhaps a cyclopropane ring is formed, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the ethynyl group is first converted into a benzyl alcohol via some addition, then the alcohol is oxidized to an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a propargyl alcohol, which is then oxidized.

Wait, but I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should consider each option's steps and see which leads to the target.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride → Li/NH3 → O3/H2O → NH4OH.

So, step 1: ethynylcyclohexane reacts with NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So, the acetylide forms, then reacts with ethyl chloride to add an ethyl group, making a longer alkyne.

Step 2: Li/NH3 is a strong base, used in deprotonation, perhaps for Birch reductions or for alkyne reactions. Alternatively, it might be used for elimination.

Step 3: Ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyls. So, the molecule must have a double bond at this point.

Step 4: NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent, perhaps for breaking ozonides into carbonyls.

But how does this lead to the target?

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are: alkyne → alkylated alkyne → alkene via some reaction → ozonolysis to form carbonyls → workup to form aldehyde and other groups.

Hmm.

Another possibility: Let's consider that the alkyne is first alkylated to a longer alkyne, then hydrogenated to a cis-alkene (using a different catalyst), then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyls. Then, the workup would form the aldehyde and other groups.

But I'm not sure which option fits that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne → benzyl chloride via alkylation.
2. Benzyl chloride → benzyl alcohol via hydrolysis.
3. Benzyl alcohol → oxidation to benzaldehyde.

But I don't see that in the options.

Wait, perhaps after alkylation and hydrogenation, the molecule has a structure that can be ozonolyzed to form a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C. Let's see:

Option C: Step 1 → alkylation, step 2 → hydrogenate alkyne to single bond, step 3 → ozonolysis (but without a double bond, maybe I'm missing something), step 4 → Ba(OH)2.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and can cause elimination reactions. So perhaps after ozonolysis, which under (CH3)2S would form aldehydes, then Ba(OH)2 would cause some elimination to form the desired structure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting too stuck. Another approach is to think about the target as a combination of two rings: the main cyclohexane with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde. And the same carbon where the alkyne was becomes the site for the aldehyde and the CH2OH group.

But I'm not making progress. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because:

Option C's steps:

1. Alkylation to add methyl group.
2. Hydrogenation to single bond.
3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup, giving aldehydes.
4. Ba(OH)2, a strong base, perhaps for elimination or forming rings.

Wait, but ozonolysis requires a double bond, which wouldn't be present if step 2 hydrogenated the alkyne to a single bond. So, this seems contradictory. So, perhaps option C isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding step 2. Maybe step 2 is not complete hydrogenation but partial hydrogenation to an alkene.

Wait, if step 2 is H2/Pd-c, which might hydrogenate the triple bond into a cis double bond (if using a poisoned catalyst), then step 3 (ozonolysis) would break the double bond into two carbonyls.

After ozonolysis, we'd have two carbonyl groups adjacent to each other. Then, step 4, Ba(OH)2 could cause some condensation or elimination to form a ring.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option D: NaNH2 and methanol, which forms a benzyl alcohol, then Li/NH3 for some reaction, then ozonolysis, then NH4OH.

Wait, perhaps the first step forms a benzyl alcohol. So, the alkyne becomes a CH2OH group, attached to the cyclohexane.

Then, Li/NH3 (Birch conditions) might reduce the benzyl alcohol to a benzyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is introducing a hydroxyl group, which then is oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, I'm not making progress here. Another approach: perhaps the correct answer is option C, because after ozonolysis, an aldehyde is formed, and Ba(OH)2 could facilitate the formation of the cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkyne → alkylated to longer alkyne.
2. Alkyne → hydrogenated to cis-alkene.
3. Alkene → ozonolysis to two carbonyls.
4. Workup and base for elimination to form rings.

But I'm not certain.

After considering all options, I think the correct sequence is option C, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct.

Wait, another thought: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group. How can that be formed? Maybe via a Grignard reaction, but I don't see any Grignard reagents in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a benzyl chloride, which is then hydrolyzed to benzyl alcohol, and then oxidized to benzaldehyde. But I don't see that in the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to form a longer alkyne.
2. Hydrogenate to a cis-alkene.
3. Ozonolysis to form two carbonyls.
4. Oxidize one carbonyl to an aldehyde and the other to a carboxylic acid, but that doesn't fit the target.

Alternatively, perhaps after ozonolysis, the two carbonyls are adjacent, and Ba(OH)2 causes them to form a ring.

Hmm. I think I've thought through all the possibilities and the correct sequence is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The target molecule, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, has a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (aldehyde) and a CH2OH group attached to another cyclohexane. Starting from ethynylcyclohexane, the synthesis involves functionalizing the alkyne and introducing the necessary substituents.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - Step 1 involves NaNH2 and methyl chloride, likely alkylating the acetylide.  
   - Step 2 (H2/Pd) reduces the alkyne to a single bond.  
   - Step 3 (Ba(OH)2) and Step 4 (H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O) suggest oxidation or elimination.  
   However, the sequence does not clearly lead to the formation of the aldehyde and CH2OH group.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Step 1 alkylates the acetylide with ethyl chloride.  
   - Step 2 (Li/liq. NH3) could deprotonate or reduce the alkyne.  
   - Step 3 (O3/H2O) cleaves double bonds, and Step 4 (NH4OH) neutralizes.  
   This sequence does not clearly explain the formation of the cyclohexyl group or the aldehyde.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Step 1 alkylates the acetylide with methyl chloride.  
   - Step 2 (H2/Pd-c) reduces the alkyne to a single bond.  
   - Step 3 (O3/(CH3)2S) cleaves double bonds reductively.  
   - Step 4 (Ba(OH)2) facilitates elimination or ring formation.  
   This sequence aligns with the formation of the aldehyde and CH2OH group, though the exact pathway is unclear.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Step 1 involves NaNH2 and methanol, potentially forming a benzyl alcohol.  
   - Step 2 (Li/liq. NH3) could reduce or modify the structure.  
   - Step 3 (O3/(CH3)2S) cleaves double bonds, and Step 4 (NH4OH) neutralizes.  
   This sequence does not clearly explain the introduction of the cyclohexyl group.

### Conclusion:
Option C provides the most plausible sequence for synthesizing the target molecule. The alkylation, hydrogenation, ozonolysis, and base treatment steps collectively lead to the formation of the aldehyde and CH2OH group on the cyclohexane ring. While some steps are ambiguous, this option aligns best with the required transformations.
