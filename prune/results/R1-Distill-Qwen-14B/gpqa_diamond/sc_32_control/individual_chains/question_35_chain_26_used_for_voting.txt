Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to break this down.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, denoted as A_y = c·S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So I guess I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix.

Wait, wait. So first, maybe I should write out the matrix A_y explicitly. Let me compute that. Since c is h/(4π), and S is given, A_y would be c multiplied by each element of S. So the first row is (0, -i c), and the second row is (i c, 0).

So putting it together, A_y is:
[ 0,      -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π)),  0 ]

Wait, but h is Planck's constant. I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are related to the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Oh wait, because the Pauli matrices are usually σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, and the spin matrices S are (ħ/2)σ. So maybe that's relevant here.

Wait, the problem gives S as a matrix, and A_y is c times S. Let me compute the matrix elements. So S is:

0  -i
i   0

Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right! The Pauli Y matrix is usually written as:
[0, -i]
[i, 0]

So S must be the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by something. Wait, because the Pauli matrices are 2x2 and used for spin-1/2 systems. So if S is the Pauli Y matrix, then S = i * σ_y? Or wait, perhaps the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, and their Y is [0, -i; i, 0]. So yes, that's exactly what S is here.

So, the operator A_y is c times the Pauli Y matrix. So A_y = c * σ_y.

Wait, but the standard spin operators are S = (ħ/2) σ, so S_y would be (ħ/2) σ_y. So in this case, A_y is c * σ_y. And c is given as h/(4π). Let's compute that.

Wait, h is Planck's constant, and ħ is h/(2π). So h/(4π) is ħ/2. Oh wait, so c = h/(4π) = ħ/(2π) * 2π? No, wait: ħ is h/(2π), so h = 2π ħ. So c is (2π ħ) / (4π) ) = (2 ħ π)/(4 π) ) = ħ/2. So c = ħ/2.

So A_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y. Which is exactly the standard spin-y operator S_y, because S = (ħ/2) σ. So A_y = S_y.

Wait, but the problem says A_y = c·S, and here c is ħ/2, and S is σ_y. So yes, exactly. So the operator is S_y, the spin y-component.

So the eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. Because for spin-1/2 particles, the eigenvalues of the spin components are ± ħ/2.

Wait, but wait. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So when multiplied by (ħ/2), the eigenvalues become ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues of A_y (which is S_y) are ± ħ/2. But wait, the question asks about the eigenvalues of A_y. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/(2).

Now, looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh or something. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Because eigenvalues are real? Wait, wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, the angular momentum operators are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues are real. So all options with complex eigenvalues are wrong, except I thought the question is about an operator that may or may not be Hermitian. Wait, let me check.

Wait, A_y is an angular momentum component, which should be Hermitian. So its eigenvalues should be real. Let me look at the given matrix A_y to confirm.

A_y is [0, -i c; i c, 0]. Let's compute its Hermitian conjugate. The conjugate transpose would swap the off-diagonal elements and take their complex conjugates. So the (2,1) element is i c, so conjugate is -i c. So the Hermitian conjugate would have (1,2) element as i c, and (2,1) as -i c. Comparing to A_y, which has (1,2) as -i c and (2,1) as i c. The Hermitian conjugate is not the same as A_y unless c is zero, which it's not. So wait, that suggests that A_y is not Hermitian. But that's impossible because angular momentum operators are Hermitian.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the matrix. Let me re-express A_y correctly. The matrix S is given as first row 0 -i, second row i 0.

So S is:
[0   -i]
[i    0 ]

So the operator A_y is c multiplied by this matrix, so:

A_y = c * S = [0, -i c; i c, 0 ]

Now, the transpose of A_y is [0, i c; -i c, 0], and the complex conjugate would flip the sign of the i terms. So the conjugate transpose (dagger) would be [0, -i c; i c, 0], which is the same as the original matrix A_y. So A_y is Hermitian. Because (A_y)† = A_y.

So eigenvalues are real, which means all options that suggest complex eigenvalues are incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Imaginary part ±2πh or ±... So eigenvalues are complex. Not possible. So option A is wrong.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Again, eigenvalues are complex. So this is wrong.

Option C: The eigenfunction can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Well, since A is the angular momentum operator, its square should commute with A_y. So if φ is an eigenfunction of A_y, it should also be an eigenfunction of A². Because for angular momentum, L² and L_x, L_y, L_z commute with each other in pairs (except for the ladder operators, which have [L+, L-]=2L_z etc.), but in this case, A is the Y component, and assuming A is part of a vector operator, then A² would commute with A_y. So φ would be an eigenfunction of A² as well.

But what about Az? A and Az are different components. So A_y and A_z don't commute. So if φ is an eigenstate of A_y, it cannot be an eigenstate of A_z, unless the system has maximal symmetry, but generally they don't. So the statement in option C is correct. So option C may be correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, the basis functions are probably the eigenvectors of Ay. So the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors of Ay. So this statement is correct, but let me think again.

Wait, the basis functions of the matrix are the eigenvectors, which form a basis for the space. So yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. So option D is correct.

Wait, but wait. Both options C and D could be correct. So I need to check which statements are correct.

Wait, let's go back to the problem. The question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

So first, the eigenvalues of Ay are ± ħ/2, which is real. So options A and B are wrong because they suggest complex eigenvalues.

Now, option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

As A² is the square of the angular momentum, which commutes with Ay, so their eigenfunctions are shared. But since Ay and Az don't commute, an eigenfunction of Ay cannot be an eigenfunction of Az. So option C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay. Well, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, but the basis functions are the eigenvectors. So for a 2x2 matrix, the two eigenvectors (with possible some multiplicities) form a basis. So statement D is correct.

Wait, but wait. Are the eigenvectors of Ay the same as the basis functions of Ay? The matrix is 2x2, so it has two eigenvectors (assuming they are distinct, which they are for spin ½ systems). So yes, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the space. So D is correct.

But wait, the question says which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct? But looking at the options, each option is a choice.

Wait, but the problem is which statements are correct. So perhaps both statements C and D are correct. But let me look again.

Wait, the question says, "which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation?" So perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, looking at the options, let's reevaluate.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. That's correct because [A^2, Ay] =0, but [Ay, Az] ≠0.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So the eigenvectors are the basis for the space. So yes, that's correct.

Hmm. So both C and D seem correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is which statement is correct. So I have to pick the correct statement.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator.

Wait, perhaps statement D is not necessarily correct. Because the basis functions for the matrix operator may refer to the standard basis, not the eigenvectors.

Wait, no. The eigenfunctions are the vectors that the operator acts on. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors form a basis (assuming they are distinct, which they are for spin ½). So statement D is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because both C and D seem correct. But perhaps the question allows for only one correct option.

Let me think again. The matrix A_y is a 2x2 matrix, so it's in a two-dimensional space. The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) must form a basis for this space. So statement D is correct.

So in the options, both C and D could be correct, but looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Let me think about statement D again. It says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So the matrix operator is 2x2, and the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors (since any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenvectors). So D is correct.

But let's see the possible options. Let me see: the problem is about which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So during the calculation, which statement is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. That's correct because the eigenvectors form the basis.

Wait, but maybe the question refers to the standard basis, not the eigenbasis. I'm a bit confused.

Another approach: let's calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

A_y is a 2x2 matrix with elements [0, -i c; i c, 0].

The eigenvalues are found by solving det(A_y - λ I) =0.

So determinant of ( -λ, -i c; i c, -λ ) = ( -λ )^2 - ( -i c)(i c ) = λ² - ( (-i)(i) c^2 ) = λ² - ( ( (-i)(i) ) c^2 ).

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) =1. So determinant is λ² - (1 * c²) =0.

So λ² = c² => λ = ± c.

So the eigenvalues are ±c. Now, c is h/(4π), but wait earlier I thought c=ħ/2. Let me check.

c = h/(4 π) = (2 π ħ )/(4 π) )= (2 ħ )/(4 )= ħ/2.

So c=ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ±(ħ/2).

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly state this. Let me look again.

Option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. But the eigenvalues are real, so they have zero imaginary part. So option B is incorrect.

So the eigenvalues are real and equal to ±c, which is ±ħ/2.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me re-examine the options.

Option A: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh or –2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Since eigenvalues are real, the imaginary part is zero. So A is wrong.

Option B: same issue, eigenvalues real, so B is wrong.

Options C and D are still in play.

So the correct eigenvalues are ±c = ±ħ/2.

Now, the eigenvectors: for each eigenvalue λ= c and λ= -c.

For λ= c:

(A_y - c I) v =0.

So the matrix becomes:

[ -c,  -i c ]

[ i c, -c ]

Which is:

Row1: -c v1 - i c v2 =0 => -v1 -i v2 =0 → v1 = -i v2.

But since it's a 2D space, the eigenvector can be written as v2 (1, -i)^T multiplied by a normalization factor.

Similarly for λ= -c:

Equation becomes:

[ c,  -i c ]

[ i c, c ]

So row1: c v1 -i c v2 =0 → v1 = i v2.

Eigenvectors are (1, i)^T.

So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are proportional to (1, -i) and (1, i).

Now, looking at the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A^2.

Because A^2 is (A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2) multiplied by something? Wait, no. Wait, wait, in this context, what is A?

Wait, the operator in question is A_y, which is the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum. So A is the vector operator (A_x, A_y, A_z). So A^2 would be A_x² + A_y² + A_z².

But wait, perhaps the question is talking about A² being the square of the Y-component. Or perhaps it's A squared, the sum of squares.

In the problem statement, the operator is A_y, but the question says 'eigenfunctions of A²'—so probably the square of the vector, which is the total angular momentum squared, A² = A_x² + A_y² + A_z².

But since A² commutes with A_y, any eigenfunction of A_y is also an eigenfunction of A². So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Since the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis, this is correct.

Wait, but the question is about the statements that are correct during calculation. So both C and D could be correct. But perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the options.

Wait, looking at the question, the options are:

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

So both C and D are correct. But looking at the given options, only one can be correct.

Wait, but I need to choose which of the options is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Well, the given matrix is 2x2, and its eigenvectors form a basis. So statement D is correct.

But which of the options is correct?

Wait, the options are given, so let's perhaps read the problem again.

Ah, wait, the question is about the Y-component, and the matrix S is given. So the operator A_y is 2x2, and we have found its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Since A² and A_y commute, any eigenvector of A_y is also an eigenvector of A². So option C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

Well, the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So statement D is correct.

But both C and D are correct.

Wait, but the given options are A, B, C, D. So perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the problem.

The question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation.

So during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

So which statements are correct.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

So, the calculation would involve finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and during this process, do we consider that the eigenfunctions form the basis?

So D seems correct.

But perhaps the question is not about whether the eigenvectors form a basis, but whether the eigenfunctions are the same as the basis functions that the matrix is defined in.

Wait, perhaps the basis functions of the matrix operator are the standard basis vectors, not the eigenvectors. So if the eigenfunctions are written in terms of the standard basis, then the eigenvectors are linear combinations of the standard basis. So perhaps Option D is not correct.

Alternatively, the matrix operator is represented in terms of the standard basis, but the eigenvectors form a different basis. So I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about which statements are correct about the eigenfunctions.

So, Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

I think this is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis, so any vector can be expressed in terms of them. So D is correct.

But wait, looking at the options, perhaps only option C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct statement is C.

Wait, but considering that the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors of the operator, which is a 2x2 matrix, so yes, they form a basis.

Hmm. It's tricky. Let me think again.

In quantum mechanics, the eigenfunctions of an operator form a basis for the space if they are complete and orthogonal. For a 2x2 matrix, they should form a basis, assuming they're not degenerate.

So, in this case, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator, so option D is correct.

Additionally, option C is correct because the eigenfunctions of A_y are eigenfunctions of A².

But the given options don't have both C and D as options. So perhaps the problem expects only one correct option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the Y-component of the angular momentum. For spin-½ particles, the eigenfunctions of S_y are not the same as the eigenfunctions of S² and S_z. But eigenfunctions of S_y are eigenfunctions of S² because S² commutes with all components.

So, yes, option C is correct.

But I'm a bit stuck on whether D is correct or not. But the statement in D is about the eigenfunctions being the basis functions of the matrix operator. So the matrix operates in the space spanned by the eigenfunctions. So yes, they are the basis functions.

So both statements C and D are correct, which can't be the case given the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the options.

Option D says, "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

Wait, the matrix operator is given in a certain basis. The eigenfunctions are in that same basis, right? So perhaps the statement is that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions, which would mean that they are orthonormal basis vectors.

So in this case, since the eigenvectors are (1, -i) and (1, i), when normalized, they form an orthonormal basis. So yes, they are the basis functions for the operator. So D is correct.

Wait, but the matrix is already expressed in terms of the standard basis. So the eigenfunctions are expressed in the same basis. So, the eigenvectors themselves form a basis, which is the correct statement.

So, both C and D are correct statements, but only one is in the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in looking at the options. Let me check again.

The options are:

A) Imaginary parts ±2πh etc. → wrong.

B) Same issue → wrong.

C) Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az → correct.

D) Eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator → correct.

So, the problem says 'which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation'. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but in the given options, only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because during the calculation, when finding the eigenfunctions, you realize that they form a basis for the operator's matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, because the problem is about the statements during the calculation, which would include the commutation relations.

Hmm.

Wait, the problem is a multiple-choice question, and the options are given. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but according to our analysis, C is correct. So the correct answer is C.

But also, D is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

Hmm, but I'm a bit stuck. Let me try another approach.

If the eigenfunctions are the basis, then any vector can be written as a combination of them. So when you diagonalize the matrix, you're changing the basis to the eigenbasis. So yes, the eigenfunctions form a basis, making D correct.

But option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Since A² and A_y commute, their eigenfunctions are shared. But Az does not commute with A_y, so you cannot have a common eigenfunction.

Thus, option C is correct.

But the question is which statement is correct.

Wait, let me think about the options again.

The problem is in the calculation process. So what would I consider correct when calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

When I compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, I realize that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator (statement D), and also that the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² (statement C). So both statements are correct. But since it's a multiple-choice, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me recompute the eigenvalues.

Wait, the matrix A_y is:

[ 0   -i c ]
[ i c   0 ]

The eigenvalues are found by solving det(A_y - λ I) = 0.

Which gives λ² = (c)^2 → λ = ±c.

So eigenvalues are ±c. c= ħ/2. So eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

Which is real, as expected.

So, the eigenvalues are real, so statements A and B are incorrect.

Now, the eigenvectors for λ = c:

(A_y - c I) v = 0:

The matrix becomes:

[ -c , -i c ]

[ i c, -c ]

Solving for v=(v1, v2)^T.

Equation 1: -c v1 -i c v2 =0 → v1 = (-i) v2.

Equation 2: i c v1 -c v2 =0 → substitute v1: i c (-i v2) -c v2 = 0 → i*(-i) =1, so (1) * c v2 - c v2 =0 → 0=0.

So the eigenvector can be taken as v2*(1, -i)^T, where v2 is a scalar.

Similarly, for λ = -c, the eigenvector is (1, i)^T.

So, the eigenfunctions are proportional to (1, -i) and (1, i).

So, the eigenvectors are orthogonal? Let me check their dot product:

(1)(1) + (-i)(i) = 1 + (-i)(i) = 1 - (i^2) = 1 - (-1) = 2. Wait, not zero. So they are not orthogonal? Wait, but I thought for Hermitian matrices, eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the inner product. The inner product for complex vectors is the conjugate transpose.

So, the inner product of (1, -i) and (1, i) is (1)(1) + (-i)(i)* → 1 + (-i)(-i) )= 1 + (i^2) = 1 + (-1) = 0.

Wait, no. Let me compute it correctly.

The first vector is (1, -i), and the second is (1, i).

Conjugate the second vector: (1, -i).

Then take the dot product:

(1)(1) + (-i)(-i) )= 1 + (i^2) → 1 + (-1) = 0.

So they are orthogonal.

Therefore, they form an orthonormal basis when normalized.

So statement D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

Now, which statement is correct.

Looking back, the options are:

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. → Correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. → Correct.

But, the options don't allow for both to be correct. So perhaps in the context of the question, which asks which statement is correct during the calculation, the correct answer is C, because it's a statement about the properties of the operator and its eigenfunctions, whereas D is more about the basis.

Wait, but I think that both C and D are correct, but the options don't allow for that. So perhaps the intended correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator is a 2x2 matrix, so its eigenvectors are the basis. So D is correct.

I think I'm going in circles here. Perhaps I should look for which option is correct as per standard quantum mechanics principles.

In quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of a component of angular momentum (like S_y) are eigenstates of S² but not of S_z. So statement C is correct.

So the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), represented by a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Matrix Form of \( A_y \):**
   Substituting \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the operator \( A_y \) becomes:
   \[
   A_y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i c \\ i c & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   This is equivalent to \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli Y matrix.

2. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are determined by solving \( \det(A_y - \lambda I) = 0 \). This gives:
   \[
   \lambda^2 = c^2 \implies \lambda = \pm c.
   \]
   Since \( c = \frac{\hbar}{2} \), the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), which are real, as expected for a Hermitian operator.

3. **Eigenvectors of \( A_y \):**
   For \( \lambda = c \), the eigenvector satisfies:
   \[
   (A_y - c I) \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = 0 \implies v_1 = -i v_2.
   \]
   The eigenvector is proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -i \end{bmatrix} \).  
   For \( \lambda = -c \), the eigenvector is proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ i \end{bmatrix} \).  
   These eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis for the \( 2 \times 2 \) space.

4. **Analysis of Options:**
   - **Option A:** Suggests complex eigenvalues, which is incorrect because \( A_y \) is Hermitian, and its eigenvalues are real.
   - **Option B:** Also suggests complex eigenvalues, which is incorrect for the same reason as Option A.
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), but \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute.
   - **Option D:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is also correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the \( 2 \times 2 \) space.

5. **Final Decision:**
   Both Options C and D are correct based on the analysis. However, since the question asks for the statement considered correct **during the calculation**, Option C is more relevant because it highlights the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), which is a key aspect of angular momentum algebra in quantum mechanics.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option C**.

Answer: C
