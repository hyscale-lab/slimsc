Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. Parallax is a measure of distance—right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is much closer than one with 2 parsecs, right? Parallax is inversely proportional to distance.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. So, uniform in what sense? I think it means that the number density (number per volume) is the same everywhere. So, more stars would be in the nearby regions because as you go further, each shell of volume contains more stars but the volume increases. Or wait, no, if they're uniformly distributed, the number per unit volume is the same everywhere. So the number of stars in a volume is proportional to the volume.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, how does the number of stars in a certain parallax interval (like between plx and plx + d) depend on plx?

I remember that distance is related to parallax. The formula is distance d = 1/plx, where plx is in parsecs and d is in parsecs. So, plx = 1/d.

If stars are uniformly distributed in space, then the number density n is constant. The number of stars in a small volume dV is n * dV.

But dV in terms of distance (d) would be a spherical shell. The volume of a shell from d to d+dd is approximately 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4πd² dd.

But we want this in terms of parallax. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, let's substitute d in terms of plx. So, the number of stars in a shell at parallax plx would be N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx).

Wait, because dd is the change in d. Since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx^2) d plx. Hmm, the negative just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But for the number of stars, we take the absolute value, so the number is proportional to plx^{-2} multiplied by d plx.

So N = n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (d plx) * (1/plx^2) ? Wait, no, let me clarify. The volume element is 4πd² dd. Since d = 1/plx, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. So substituting, 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx² d plx) )? Wait, no. If d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. So, 4π d² |dd| is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx²)) d plx. So that's 4π/(plx^4) d plx. So the number of stars in a small parallax interval d plx would be N = n * (4π / plx^4) d plx.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if plx increases (distance decreases), there would be more stars in each unit plx. But according to this, for a given d plx, N is proportional to 1/plx^4. Hmm.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in substitution. Let's go back.

The number of stars in a spherical shell of radius d and thickness dd is N = n * 4π d² dd.

But d is 1/plx, so d = 1/(plx). So d² = 1/(plx)^2.

And dd is the change in d, which is (d(d plx)) = derivative of d with respect to plx times d plx. The derivative of d with respect to plx is d/d plx (1/plx) = -1/(plx^2). So dd = (-1/plx^2) d plx. But since we're considering a small positive increase in plx, the thickness would be |dd|, which is (1/plx^2) d plx.

Substituting, N = n *4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx² d plx) ) = n *4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So N is proportional to 1/plx^4. Hmm, but that's option A: ~1/plx^4.

But wait, that seems counterintuitive. Because if you have a larger parallax (smaller distance), you'd expect more stars in a given range. Let's see: if plx is small (like 0.1 pc), then the number of stars in d plx would be higher compared to a large plx. Wait, but according to this, N is proportional to 1/plx^4, which means higher plx (further away) would have fewer stars.

Wait, but wait—this seems to suggest that for a given change in plx (like 0.1 to 0.2 parsecs), the number of stars is proportional to 1/(plx)^4. So as plx increases, the number per unit plx goes down as 1/(plx^4). That makes sense because the volume of the shell increases with d^2, and each shell has more stars, but the plx interval depends on 1/d. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the number per unit plx (like how many stars per parsec of plx), so the number per unit plx would be dN/d plx. From N = n *4π d² dd, and substituting d = 1/plx, and dd = - (1/plx²) d plx, so N = n *4π (1/plx^2) (1/plx²) d plx = n *4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So dN/d plx is n *4π (1/plx^4). So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit parallax interval decreases with 1/plx^4 as plx increases.

But wait, that can't be right because when plx is small (close stars), you would expect a lot more stars in a small plx interval. Like, if plx is 0.1, how many stars are between 0.1 and 0.2? But according to this, the number would be proportional to 1/(0.1)^4 = 1e4, so 10,000 per unit plx? That seems high, but perhaps it's correct.

Wait, but wait—another approach: The number of stars per unit volume is n. So, the number of stars per unit distance is 4π d² n. Because each shell at distance d has area 4π d² and thickness dd, so the number in that shell is n * 4π d² dd. So the number per unit distance is (n *4π d²) per parsec.

But we want the number per unit parallax. Since d = 1/plx, d² = 1/(plx)^2. So number per unit plx would be (n *4π (1/(plx)^2)) * (dd/d plx). Wait, because the number per unit plx is the number per unit distance multiplied by (dd/d plx), which is the factor converting from dd to d plx.

Wait, earlier, we saw that dd = - (1/plx^2) d plx. So dd/d plx = -1/(plx^2). So the number per unit plx is (n *4π d²) * ( -1/(plx^2) ), but since we take the absolute value, it's (n *4π d²) * (1/(plx^2)).

But d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/(plx)^2. Substituting, the number per unit plx is (n *4π (1/(plx)^2 )) * (1/(plx^2)) ) = n 4π (1/(plx)^4).

So yeah, that gives the same result as before. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/(plx)^4, which is option A.

But wait, I thought the number of stars in a shell increases with 1/(plx)^4. So when plx increases, the number per unit plx decreases as 1/(plx)^4.

Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in thinking about the units. Let me think: the number of stars in a shell at distance d is proportional to d². Because the volume element is 4π d² dd. So the number of stars in a shell is proportional to d² * dd. If you change variables to plx, which is 1/d, then d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/(plx^2), and dd = -1/(plx^2) d plx. So the number is proportional to (1/(plx^2)) * (1/(plx^2)) ) * d plx = 1/(plx^4) d plx.

So the number of stars between plx and plx + d plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number per unit plx is 1/plx^4. So the answer should be option A.

But wait, wait. The question says "number of stars per unit range of plx". So it's per unit plx. So the number N is proportional to 1/plx^4. So as plx increases, N decreases. So the correct option is A) ~1/plx^4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The question assumes stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning the number density \( n \) is constant.

The number of stars in a spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is given by:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 \, dd
\]

Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find \( d^2 = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} \). The number of stars in terms of parallax becomes:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \, d\text{plx}
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). As parallax increases (distance decreases), the number of stars per unit parallax decreases more steeply than with any other power of \( \text{plx} \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
