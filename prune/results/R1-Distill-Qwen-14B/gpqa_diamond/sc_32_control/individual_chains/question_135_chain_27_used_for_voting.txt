Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λf ψ_f_bar ψ_f (y)(υ + X(y)). Wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation here. Oh right, in particle physics, the Lagrangian terms usually tell us about the interactions. The boson X is interacting with fermions. The fermion part is written as ψ_f_bar ψ_f, so that's probably the fermion field part. 

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So, I need to find out what particles it can decay into. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different possible fermion-antifermion pairs. 

I remember that for a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the energy (which comes from the mass of the boson) must be enough to create the pair. The mass of the boson has to be at least twice the mass of the fermion because each fermion has mass m, and the pair would have a combined energy of 2m. 

So the first thing I need to do is figure out the masses of the various fermions. Let me list what I remember:

- Electron (e^-): mass around 0.0005 GeV (negligible)
- Muon (μ^-): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ^-): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~0.003 GeV
- Down quark (d): ~0.003 GeV (though a bit heavier than u)
- Strange (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm (c): ~1.275 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.13 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, like ~173 GeV

Wait, but the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. So any fermion pair that sums to less than or equal to 6 GeV is possible. Let's see: 

First, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So the possible fermion pairs would have to have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. 

Let's think about the possible pairs:

1. b quark pair (b bbar): each b is about 4.13 GeV, so two would be 8.26 GeV. That's more than 6 GeV, so this shouldn't be allowed. Wait, but wait—wait, that's a problem. Because if X is 6 GeV, and each b quark is ~4 GeV, then X can't decay into b bbar because 2*4.13 is ~8.26, which is larger than 6. So X→bb̄ is not possible. 

But wait, looking at the options, option A includes bb̄, option D includes bb̄ as well. Hmm, but if X is 6 GeV, then it can't decay into b's because 4*2 =8 >6. So that suggests that options A and D are incorrect. 

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the mass. Let me double-check. Oh wait, the top quark is around 173 GeV, but the bottom is about 4.7 GeV maybe? Or is it 4.13? I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact numbers, but the point is, it's about 4 GeV. So 6 GeV is less than 8 GeV, so b quarks are out. So any decay channel that includes b's can't be allowed. 

So options A and D can be eliminated because both include bb̄. So that leaves options B and C. 

Next, let's look at other fermions. 

Option B: c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Let me check the masses:

c: ~1.275 GeV. So 2c would be 2.55 GeV. 6 GeV is plenty for that. 

s: ~0.095 GeV. 2s is ~0.19 GeV. Well under 6 GeV. 

u, d: almost 0 mass, so their pairs are allowed. 

tau: 1.777 GeV each. 2*1.777 is ~3.55 GeV. So that's allowed. 

mu: ~0.105 GeV. 2*0.105 is 0.21 GeV. 

e: negligible. 

So all the pairs in option B are allowed because their combined masses are much less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into any of these. 

Option C includes t tbar, but X is 6 GeV and t is 173 GeV. 2t would be 346 GeV, which is way beyond X's mass. So option C is invalid. 

But wait, another thing: the interaction term given in the Lagrangian. Let me look again: L(y) = -λf f bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps I misread the term. Oh wait, the term is more like λ times the sum of maybe Yukawa coupling terms. Wait, the term is written as -λ f f_bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y), which is a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is something like λ f ψ_f† (y) X(y) ψ_f (y), where f is the Yukawa coupling. 

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the general Yukawa interaction is something like L = y ψ ψ X, where y is the Yukawa coupling. So in this case, the interaction would be between the boson X and the fermion ψ_f. So for X to decay into fermions f and fbar, the Yukawa coupling must be non-zero. 

So the allowed decays would depend on which fermions have a non-zero Yukawa coupling with X. But the question doesn't give us any info about which fermions are coupled. Wait, but the problem statement just gives the interaction term as involving ψ_f. So perhaps the fermion ψ_f is a specific type, and the possible decay products are into that fermion. 

Wait, no, perhaps the problem is that the interaction is with a fermion field ψ_f, which could be any fermion as long as they have the corresponding coupling. So the possible decay products of X would be any fermion-antifermion pair where the fermion has a non-zero coupling to X. But without knowing which fermions are involved, perhaps the problem is assuming that X can decay into any possible fermion that has a mass less than 3 GeV (since X is 6 GeV, so each fermion must be less than 3 GeV). 

Wait, but in reality, the Yukawa coupling depends on the specific fermions. For example, the Higgs boson couples to all fermions, but their couplings vary. But perhaps in this problem, X can decay into any fermion pair as long as their combined mass is less than 6 GeV. 

Wait, but the problem says that the interaction is given by that Lagrangian. So perhaps the fermions ψ_f are all the possible types, implying that X can interact with any fermion. So in that case, the allowed decays are any where the fermion pair's mass is ≤6 GeV.

So going back, X can decay into any f fbar where m_f*2 ≤6 GeV. So what's the maximum mass a fermion can have to be allowed? 3 GeV each. 

So let's list the fermions:

- e, mu, tau: all have masses <<3 GeV. So their pairs are allowed.

- u, d: way below.

- s: ~0.1 GeV. So 2s is 0.2 GeV.

- c: ~1.275 GeV. 2c is ~2.55 GeV. Which is less than 6 GeV.

- b: ~4.13 GeV. 2b is ~8.26 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So b is excluded.

- t: 173 GeV, way too heavy.

So the allowed fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So the possible decay channels are:

X → e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option B has c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. So that's all the allowed ones except for the bottom quarks, which are excluded because 2mb is more than 6 GeV.

Option C includes t tbar, which isn't allowed. So option B is correct.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option B is: c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's exactly the list I came up with. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but I'm going back to the initial problem statement. The boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. So the maximum mass each fermion in the pair can have is 3 GeV. So the charm quark is about 1.275 GeV, so that's fine. But what about the strange quark, which is about 0.095 GeV, so that's way under.

So the possible decay modes are all the fermion pairs except for b and t quarks. So the options are:

Option B includes all these except for the bottom quarks, which it doesn't have. So option B is correct.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction term provided in the Lagrangian indicates that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, but the decay is only possible if the combined mass of the fermion-antifermion pair is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \). 

The mass of \( X \) is 6 GeV, so the maximum mass for a single fermion in the pair is \( 6 \, \text{GeV} / 2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \). The masses of known fermions are as follows:

- Electron (\( e^- \)): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu^- \)): \( \sim 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau^- \)): \( \sim 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 0.003 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 0.003 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( \sim 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.275 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.13 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

From these masses, the fermion-antifermion pairs that satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) are:

- \( e^+ e^- \)
- \( \mu^+ \mu^- \)
- \( \tau^+ \tau^- \)
- \( u \bar{u} \)
- \( d \bar{d} \)
- \( s \bar{s} \)
- \( c \bar{c} \)

The bottom quark (\( b \)) and top quark (\( t \)) are excluded because their masses are too large (\( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 2m_t > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Eliminated**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), and \( e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Valid**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. **Eliminated**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Eliminated**.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \).

Answer: B
