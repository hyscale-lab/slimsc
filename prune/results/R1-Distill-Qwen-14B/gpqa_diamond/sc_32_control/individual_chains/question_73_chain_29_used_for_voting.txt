Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic speeds, so I guess I should use special relativity equations. Let me try to break this down.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses of 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So, astronaut A is 2m moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is 3m moving at 0.5c. I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy.

First, the relative speed. I remember that when two objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed isn't just the difference of their speeds because of relativity. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Wait, but wait, which one is moving faster? Oh, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, which is faster than B's 0.5c. So from B's frame, what's A's speed?

Wait, no. Wait, in relativity, the relative speed isn't just a straightforward subtraction. Let me get the formula right. The velocity of object A as observed from object B's frame is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²), where u is A's speed and v is B's speed, both from the rest frame. Oh wait, or is it the other way around? Let me think. Let me define the frame: the rest frame is, say, the lab frame where both are moving. So from the lab frame, A is moving at 0.6c, B at 0.5c. But if I want the speed of A relative to B, that's the speed of A minus B's speed, but adjusted for relativity.

So u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. So v_rel would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that. Numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel is (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857 c, which is approximately 0.143c. So looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that narrows it down.

Now for the total energy. The total energy of the system would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Wait, but wait! Are they in the same rest frame? Or do I need to consider something else? Oh, no, the problem is probably asking for the total energy as measured in the lab frame, which is the same frame where both are moving. So each has their own relativistic energy.

So the energy of each is gamma * m c². So for astronaut A, mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So v² is (0.6c)^2 = 0.36 c². So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Square root is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E_A = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. v² = 0.25 c². 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. Square root is about 0.8660, so gamma is 1/0.866 ≈ 1.1547. So E_B = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E_A + E_B ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². Hmm, looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and option B's E is 4.96. So if the calculation is correct, the total energy is approximately 5.96, which matches option C.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. The problem says "the total energy of the system." But in relativity, when you have two objects in a system, their energies add, yes. But is the system's total energy just the sum of their individual energies in the same frame? I think so because from the lab frame, each has their own energy, so adding them makes sense.

So putting it together, the relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C is v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the relative speed calculation. Let me recompute it.

v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/(c²)).

Which is (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) → (0.1c)/0.7 → approximately 0.142857c, which is 0.142857, so about 0.143c. Rounded to two decimal places, that's 0.14c. So yes, option C has 0.14c.

So, the correct answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system using relativistic formulas.

### Relative Speed
The formula for the relative velocity between two objects moving in the same direction is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) (Astronaut A's speed) and \( v = 0.5c \) (Astronaut B's speed). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.143c
\]

Rounded to two decimal places, \( v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For **Astronaut A** (\( m = 2m \), \( v = 0.6c \)):

\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For **Astronaut B** (\( m = 3m \), \( v = 0.5c \)):

\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5.96m c^2 \)**.
