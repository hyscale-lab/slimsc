Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let's read it again. The question is about identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Let me break down the given data step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H groups. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids? Oh wait, but wait, a very broad peak is more typical of an alcohol or maybe an amide, but I don't see any info about amides here. Also, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, I remember that carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes, esters, etc.) absorb around 1700 cm⁻¹. The 1650 might be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds or maybe a conjugated carbonyl group. Alternatively, the 1650 could be an amide or another type of carbonyl.

Wait, but the FTIR has a very broad peak at 3000. That's probably an O-H stretch. So maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But I'm not sure yet. But then, the presence of peaks at 1700 and 1650 might suggest another functional group. Let's think: 1700 is a strong peak for a carbonyl. The 1650 could be an aromatic ring (maybe C=C stretching) or a conjugated carbonyl. Wait, maybe it's an ester? Or perhaps a ketone and an aromatic ring?

Now the ¹H NMR data: it includes peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond, maybe an aromatic ring or an alkene.

Mass spec shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. I need to think about what that could be. Common fragments at 45 include maybe CH₂CO (like from a ketone) or something else. Let me think, 45 is the mass of a methyl group plus something else. Wait, 45 is the mass of (CH3O) or maybe (CH3CO). Oh, wait, the molecular ion for (CH3)2CO (acetone) is 58, but that's the molecular ion. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like CH₂CO would be 45? Or perhaps a CH2CH2 group? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, 45 could be a carbonyl-containing fragment. Another thought: the fragment might come from a ketone or an ester.

Putting this together: the compound has an O-H group (from the broad IR peak), a carbonyl group (from 1700 cm⁻¹), a conjugated system (1650 cm⁻¹), and some vinyl hydrogens (from NMR). Let me think about possible functional groups. Maybe an ester with an alcohol? No, because esters are O-C-O. Wait, but if the compound has both an alcohol and an ester, that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid ester? Or maybe a beta-keto ester or something like that.

Wait, another angle: Let's consider each functional group.

Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹: O-H (alcohol or carboxylic acid). But if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be even broader and possibly wider. But the data just says a very broad absorption, so perhaps it's an alcohol.

The 1700 cm⁻¹ is a carbonyl. So maybe an ester or a ketone. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring. Alternatively, if it's an ester, the carbonyl would be around 1740-1710 cm⁻¹. Wait, but the question says 1700 and 1650. So 1700 is a carbonyl, maybe an ester or ketone. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, but that's less likely. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic ring or conjugated double bonds.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's an aromatic ring with a ketone group. For example, acetophenone. Acetophenone has a carbonyl at around 1700 cm⁻¹ and C=C in the ring around 1600-1680 cm⁻¹. But wait, the 1650 is a bit higher than typical benzene. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone, which would have conjugated double bonds, leading to a lower carbonyl stretch (maybe around 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹).

Wait, if the compound has a carbonyl group and an adjacent double bond (like a conjugated system), then the NMR would show vinyl hydrogens. So maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone or ester.

Alternatively, the compound could be a benzoate ester. For example, methyl benzoate has a carbonyl around 1700 cm⁻¹, and the ring might show C=C around 1600s. But the IR here has 1650, which could fit.

Another thought: the presence of a carbonyl group and O-H group. So maybe it's a phenol with a ketone or ester group. But phenol O-H is usually broader than an alcohol's, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the IR data: two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, maybe two different carbonyl groups? But that's less common. Another possibility is that the 1700 is a carbonyl and the 1650 is an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. So, perhaps the compound has both a carbonyl and an aromatic ring.

The NMR shows vinyl protons, which are the H's attached to a double bond. So that suggests either an alkene or an aromatic ring. So if the compound has an aromatic ring, the NMR would show signals for the aromatic H's. But the question only mentions peaks for vinyl H's, so maybe the structure is such that the aromatic H's are not observed, like in a substituted benzene where the H's are deshielded or in a particular coupling that's difficult to see. Alternatively, the structure isn't aromatic but has an isolated double bond.

Wait, the mass spec shows a fragment at m/z=45. Let's think about possible fragments. 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CO (acetone is 58, so that's not it). Wait, 45 could be the fragment for CH2CH2O or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CO fragment, which would be 45 (12*2 + 1*2 +16 = 44? Wait, 12*2=24, 1*2=2, 16=16, sum is 42. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's CH3CO (45?), let's calculate: CH3CO+ would be 12*2 + 1*4 + 16 = 24 +4 +16=44. So m/z 44? Close but not 45. Maybe it's a fragment where oxygen is part of it.

Wait, maybe it's a ketone. If the compound is something like 3-pentanone, but that wouldn't have O-H. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ketone with an ester group?

Alternatively, 45 could be the mass of a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, perhaps the fragment is CH2CH2O, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the (CH2O) group, which is 30. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait another thought: The molecular formula options are all C6H??O and O2. So the molecular weight of the compound could be calculated based on the options. Let's see: for each option:

A) C6H12O2: 6*12=72, 12*1=12, 2*16=32 → 72+12+32=116.

B) C6H10O: 72 +10 +16=98.

C) C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114.

D) C6H12O:72 +12 +16=100.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z=45. So perhaps the molecular ion breaks into a fragment of 45 and another part. Let's think about which of these options would produce a 45 fragment.

If the molecular formula is C6H12O2 (A), the molecular weight is 116. So a fragment of 45 would imply another fragment of 71 (116-45=71). Is that plausible? Alternatively, if the molecular weight is 114 (option C), then 114-45=69. Hmm.

Wait, if the compound is an ester, for example, like methyl something. Esters typically have the structure R-O-CO-R'. The mass of the ester group is (O-CO-O), but perhaps a fragment could break off. Alternatively, if the compound is something like methyl acrylate, which has a structure with a double bond adjacent to the ester. Maybe the fragment would be from the ester group.

Alternatively, the fragment at 45 could come from a ketone. For example, if the molecule undergoes cleavage to form a smaller fragment.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the 45 fragment is a small group. Let's think of possible groups with a molecular weight of 45. That would be, for example, (CH3)2CH-O- (but that's 44?), or maybe a ketone group like CH3CO (43), but I'm not getting 45.

Wait, another possibility is a fragment like O-CO-OCH3. Wait, that's more than 45. Maybe the fragment is a methyl group attached to a carbonyl. Wait, methyl ketone would be (CH3)CO-. So, the (CH3)CO+ ion would be (12*2 + 1*3 +16) = 24 +3 +16=43. Hmm, not 45.

Wait, perhaps it's the fragment from the ester group. For example, an ester like R-O-CO-R' might break into R-O-CO and R'. The fragment R-O-CO could be a certain mass. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the 45 comes from a benzene ring loss. Wait, benzene is 78, which is higher than 45. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula. Let's consider each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degree of unsaturation? For C6H12O2:

Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. No X or N here. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree, which could be a ring or a double bond. But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, implying a double bond. So with one degree, perhaps a ring plus a double bond? Or just a double bond.

Wait, but wait: for C6H12O2, the calculation is (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree. So either a ring and a double bond, or a triple bond, etc. But the NMR shows vinyl H, so a double bond is present. So if the compound has a double bond and a ring, that accounts for two degrees, but wait, the calculation says only one. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate. For C6H12O2:

DOU = (2*6 +2 -12 +0 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1.

So only one degree. So either a ring and a double bond (which would be two) or a triple bond (one), but that's unlikely. Alternatively, an aromatic ring with two double bonds (so that's two degrees, but the calculation only shows one. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: each ring or double bond is one degree. So for benzene (C6H6), DOU is (2*6 +2 -6)/2 = (14-6)/2=4. So four degrees (three from the ring, one from the double bonds? No, wait, a benzene ring has three double bonds, so that's three degrees, plus a ring? No, a ring is one degree. So benzene has three double bonds (three degrees) plus the ring is a single degree, but wait... No, each ring is one degree, each double bond is another. So benzene has three double bonds (each is one, so three) plus a ring (but each ring is already counted as a double bond if it's a cyclic structure. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, the formula C6H12O2 has a DOU of 1, which could be a ring plus a double bond (two degrees), but that would sum to two. Hmm, perhaps the formula is more accurately for a compound with one double bond and no rings. Or, maybe a ring and a double bond elsewhere.

But this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think about the options again and try to match the data.

The FTIR suggests the presence of an O-H group (from the broad peak), a carbonyl group (1700), and possibly an aromatic ring or conjugated double bonds (1650). The NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. The mass spec has a fragment at 45.

Looking back, another approach: the fragment at 45 could be a ketone. Let's think about the possible options. 

If the compound is a benzaldehyde derivative, would that produce a 45 fragment? Benzaldehyde is C7H6O, so the molecular weight is 106. But that's not matching any of the options here.

Wait, another thought: the 45 fragment could be the loss of a group. For example, if the compound loses a fragment of 45, the remaining part would have a mass equal to molecular weight minus 45. So let's see for each option:

Option A: C6H12O2 → molecular weight 116. 116 -45=71. Is 71 a plausible mass? For example, it could be something like a benzene ring (78) minus 7, but I'm not sure.

Option B: C6H10O → molecular weight 98. 98-45=53. 53 could be C3H7O? Not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2 → molecular weight 114. 114-45=69. 69 is C4H9O perhaps?

Option D: C6H12O → molecular weight 100. 100-45=55. 55 could be C3H5O2 or similar.

I'm not sure if any of these add up. Maybe I should think about the functional groups again.

The presence of a carbonyl (1700) and a broad O-H suggests it's an ester with an alcohol group? Or maybe a carboxylic ester. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a beta-keto ester, which would have two carbonyl groups. Wait, but the IR shows two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Beta-keto esters have two carbonyl groups, the ketone around 1700 and the ester around 1730. So the 1700 might be the ester, but the 1650 would be the ketone. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a conjugated double bond adjacent to a carbonyl, making it an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. That would fit with the IR peaks at 1700 and 1650. In such compounds, the conjugated system leads to a lower wavenumber for the carbonyl. Wait, no, the carbonyl is usually higher when conjugated. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ester. Like phenyl acetate. Phenyl acetate has a structure OAc-O-Ph. The carbonyl in the ester is around 1740 cm⁻¹, which is higher than the 1700 given. Hmm, but perhaps in some cases it can be lower.

But the 1650 peak is another issue. If the compound has an aromatic ring, the C=C in the ring would show around 1450-1600 cm⁻¹. 1650 is a bit on the higher side, but possible for conjugated double bonds.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is a diethyl acetyl something? Or perhaps a cyclic ester, like a lactone.

Alternatively, considering the possibility of a six-membered ring with substituents. Maybe an aromatic ring with a substituent that has a carbonyl group.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options, let's consider each one's possible structure.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures: ester, like methyl cyclopentanecarboxylate. Alternatively, an aromatic ester, but I'm not sure. If it's an ester, then the IR would show the ester carbonyl at around 1700-1750. The 1700 cm⁻¹ fits. The 1650 could be the ring's C=C. The O-H group would be from the alcohol. Wait, but if it's an ester, where is the O-H? Esters don't have O-H groups, unless it's a hemiacetal or something. Oh, wait—maybe the compound is a diol ester, but that's more complicated.

Wait, maybe it's a beta-keto ester. The structure would be something like CH2(COOR)COOR. But I'm not very confident.

Option B: C6H10O. That's a molecular formula of C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. Could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. If it's a cyclic ether with a double bond. But not sure. Doesn't explain the O-H and carbonyl.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. Two degrees. Could be a ring and a double bond, or two rings, etc.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6+2 -12)/2=(14-12)/2=1. So one degree: a ring or a double bond.

Back to the mass spec. If the fragment is at 45, perhaps it's a CH2CO group. CH2CO has a molecular weight of 44. Hmm, but 45 is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3COO group (45?), let's calculate: CH3COO is 12*2 + 1*3 +16*2=24 +3 +32=59. Hmm, which is higher than 45.

Wait, another angle: For the mass spec, the fragment at 45 could be the acylium ion (RCO+). The acylium ion would have a mass equal to RCO. So if the RCO is 45, the R would be (45-16-12)=17? That doesn't make much sense. Wait, RCO+ would have a mass of (R) + 44 (for CO). So 45 would mean R is 1 (CH3? Wait, CH3 is 15. 15 + 44=59. Not matching 45. So perhaps that's not the case.

Another possibility is that the fragment is from an ester group. For example, the ester oxygen could break, leading to a fragment with a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment comes from a small aldehyde. For example, formaldehyde is 30, acetaldehyde is 44 (CH3CHO), but 45 is close. Wait, maybe it's a ketone like acetone (43). Hmm.

Wait, could the fragment be from the loss of a group? For example, if the compound is a larger molecule that loses a fragment of 45, then the remaining would be another part. Let's think about each option:

If the formula is C6H12O2 (Option A), molecular weight 116. If a fragment of 45 is lost, the remaining would be 71. What's a 71 fragment? 71 could be C5H11O or something. Not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2 → molecular weight 114. 114-45=69. 69 could be C5H11O? Or C3H7O2? Not sure.

Wait, another thought: the presence of a carbonyl and an O-H group suggests an ester and an alcohol. But that would mean the compound is a hemiacetal or something similar, which is less likely. Alternatively, the compound could be a beta-keto alcohol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester, a lactone. Lactones have a cyclic ester structure. For example, gamma-butyrolactone is a five-membered ring. The IR would show the ester carbonyl around 1750 cm⁻¹, but our data is 1700, which is a bit lower. Hmm.

Alternatively, if the compound is an aromatic ester, like methyl benzoate. Methyl benzoate has the structure OMe-CO-O-benzene. Its IR would show the ester carbonyl around 1700. The O-H would come from where? Oh wait, methyl benzoate doesn't have an O-H group, so that can't be. So the O-H must be part of the compound.

So maybe the compound is a phenyl ester with an alcohol group elsewhere. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a diol with a ketone group, but that doesn't fit the O-H and carbonyl.

Alternatively, the compound is a beta-keto ester. Let's think about that. A beta-keto ester would have two carbonyl groups. One from the ketone (around 1700) and one from the ester (maybe around 1750, but in some cases, it could be lower). But our data shows 1700 and 1650. So maybe the ester is lower due to conjugation.

Wait, the IR shows two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. If the compound is a beta-keto ester, the ketone's carbonyl is around 1700, and the ester's carbonyl would be around 1750-1720. But in the data, the next peak is at 1650, which is lower. Hmm, that might not fit. Unless the ester is conjugated with another group, lowering its carbonyl.

Alternatively, the 1650 peak is from an aromatic ring, assuming the compound has a benzene ring.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the options again.

Suppose the formula is C6H10O2 (option C). The molecular weight is 114. The degrees of unsaturation are 2, which could be a ring and a double bond or two double bonds.

If the compound is an aromatic ester with an alcohol group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. If the compound has a double bond and a ring, that would account for two degrees of unsaturation. So how does that fit with the formulas.

Option C: C6H10O2. 2 degrees. So a ring and a double bond, for example.

Putting it together: a benzene ring (3 degrees) but with substituents that reduce the count? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, a five-membered ring with a double bond, which would be two degrees.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is an ester with a conjugated double bond. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. The structure would be something like CH2=CHCOOR. The IR would show the ester carbonyl around 1700 and the conjugated double bond around 1650. That fits the IR data. The NMR would show vinyl hydrogens (from the CH2=CH group). The O-H from where? Oh wait, wait, if the compound is an ester (RCOOR'), then there's no O-H. So unless there's another functional group, like an alcohol elsewhere. Hmm, but that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond. Its structure would be something like CH2=CHCOOH. The IR would show the O-H stretch (broad around 3000), the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid (around 1700), and the conjugated double bond (1650). The NMR would have vinyl H's. The molecular formula would be C3H4O2. But that doesn't match any of the options, which are all C6.

Wait, but the options are all C6. So maybe the compound is a larger molecule, like a substituted version. For example, a benzene ring with an ester and a conjugated double bond.

Wait, but the molecular formula options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, etc. Let me see:

If the formula is C6H10O2, that's 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, and two oxygens. Degrees of unsaturation: 2. So if it's a benzene ring (3 degrees) but with another substituent that reduces the count? Or perhaps no benzene, but a double bond and a ring.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the mass spec again. If the fragment is 45, perhaps it's the methyl group plus something else. For instance, if the compound is methyl something, the loss of the methyl group (15) would leave a fragment of 45. Wait, but 45 is higher than 15.

Alternatively, acetate group (OAc-) is 60, but that's higher.

Wait, another idea: if the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a substituent that can break off. For example, a six-membered ring lactone. Breaking at the ester might produce a fragment.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from a ketone group. If the compound is a methyl ketone, like pentan-2-one, the fragment could be (CH3)CO+ which is 43. But 45 is 2 higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a (CH2)CO group. (CH2CO) is 12*2 + 1*2 +16= 24+2+16=42. Not 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a (CH2CH2O) group. That would be 48 (12*2 + 2 + 16). Hmm, no.

Wait, another angle: the molecular formula options. Let me calculate their molecular weights.

A) C6H12O2: 6*12=72, 12*1=12, 2*16=32 → 72+12+32=116.

B) C6H10O: 72 +10 +16=98.

C) C6H10O2:72 +10 +32=114.

D) C6H12O:72 +12 +16=100.

So, the molecular ion would be one of these weights. The mass spec shows a fragment at 45, which is 45. So, for each option:

If the molecular ion is 116 (A), possible to have a fragment at 45. So, 116-45=71. 71 is an odd mass, perhaps a fragment with a double bond or something.

Similarly, for option C (114), 114-45=69, which is also odd.

Option B (98) → 98-45=53.

Option D (100) → 100-45=55.

Not sure, but perhaps the presence of an ester group could lead to a fragment at 45.

Wait, another thought: the 45 fragment could be a CH3CO group. The mass of CH3CO is 43 (12*2 +1*3 +16= 24+3+16=43). Maybe it's a (CH3CO) group attached somewhere, and when it breaks off, it leaves the fragment at 43, but the question says 45. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe it's a CH2CO group. CH2CO is 12*2 +1*2 +16=24+2+16=42. Still not 45.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH2O group. 12*2 +2 +16=44. Again, close but not 45.

Wait, another thought: the fragment could be the loss of a water molecule (18) from a larger fragment. But without knowing more, it's hard to say.

Maybe I should think about the functional groups again. The O-H and the two carbonyls. If the compound has both a ketone and an ester group, or a ketone and a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. The IR has a broad O-H, so maybe an alcohol and a conjugated ester.

Alternatively, the compound could be a di-substituted benzene with an ester group and an alcohol group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, considering the molecular formula options, which one includes two oxygen atoms. That would be options A and C.

If the IR has a broad O-H, which suggests an alcohol group, and a carbonyl, which could be an ester, then the compound would have two oxygen atoms—so either A or C.

Option A: C6H12O2.

Option C: C6H10O2.

Looking at the degrees of unsaturation:

Option A: 1 degree → could be a ring or a double bond.

But NMR shows vinyl H, so a double bond must be present. So for option A, with one degree, it must be a double bond (and no rings). But then, how does the O-H fit in?

Alternatively, if it's a double bond and a ring, but that would require two degrees, which option A doesn't have.

So, perhaps option C is more likely because it has two degrees of unsaturation, which could account for a ring and a double bond.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to summarize:

FTIR: O-H (broad), carbonyl (1700), and something else (1650—possibly conjugated double bond or aromatic C=C).

¹H NMR: vinyl H's → double bond.

Mass spec: fragment at 45.

Options with two O's: A and C.

If it's option C (C6H10O2):

Degrees of unsaturation: 2 → could be a ring and a double bond.

So perhaps a six-membered ring with an ester group and a double bond. For example, a benzene ring with a vinyl ester group. But that would require conjugation, which might fit the IR data.

Alternatively, it's a cyclopentane ring with an ester and a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is methyl vinyl ketone, but that's only four carbons. Not matching the C6.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a six-carbon compound with an ester group and a conjugated double bond, like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. But that's getting complicated.

Wait, the presence of both an O-H and an ester group would mean the compound is an alcohol ester, which is possible but less common. Alternatively, maybe it's a beta-keto ester with an O-H group.

Hmm, I think I'm going in circles. Perhaps it's better to try to relate the mass spec fragment to the options.

If the fragment is 45, and the molecular weight is for option C (114), then 114-45=69. 69 could be a fragment that includes a benzene ring (78) minus 9? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the ester group. For example, if the ester breaks, the R-O-CO- part could be a fragment. Let's see, for example, in an ester like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3. The fragment might lose the R group (CH2CH2CH3) and retain the COOCH2CH2 part. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, the fragment could be from the alcohol part. For example, if the compound is an alcohol with an ester group, the alcohol (R-OH) could lose a fragment. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the compound is an aromatic ester with a substituent that has a double bond. Like phenyl propenoate. But that's getting too speculative.

Wait, considering the options again. The presence of O-H and two carbonyl groups might suggest a structure with two carbonyls, like a beta-keto ester. Let's say the structure is something like CH2(COOR)COOR. But that would be a five-carbon compound. Not matching C6.

Alternatively, the structure could be a six-membered ring with an ester and a ketone group. For example, a cyclic diketone, but not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should think that the correct answer is option C) C6H10O2. Because:

- Two oxygen atoms suggest two functional groups, like an ester and an alcohol, but I'm not sure.

- Degrees of unsaturation: 2 for option C, which could be a ring and a double bond.

Wait, but earlier I thought the O-H and carbonyl would require at least two O's. So, options A and C have two O's.

The mass fragment at 45: If the formula is C6H10O2 (114), then a fragment of 45 would imply another part of 69. Not sure, but let's think.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment at 45 comes from a CH2CH2O group. But that doesn't add up.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the loss of a COO group. But COO is 44, so 114-44=70. Not 45.

I think I'll have to make an educated guess here. The presence of O-H and two carbonyls (from IR) suggests two oxygen-containing groups, so the formula must have two O's. So options A and C.

The NMR shows vinyl H's, which means a double bond. The IR shows a conjugated system (maybe double bond near a carbonyl) or an aromatic ring.

Option C has two degrees of unsaturation, allowing for a ring and a double bond. So perhaps it's a cyclohexene with an ester group and an O-H group. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, the answer could be option A, but the degrees of unsaturation are only 1, which might not account for the double bond and the O-H.

Wait, but the degrees of unsaturation for option A is 1, which is either a ring or a double bond. But the presence of a double bond (from NMR) and a ring (from IR?) would require two degrees. So option A isn't possible, which leaves option C as the only one with two degrees.

Thus, I think the correct answer is option C) C6H10O2.

The question involves identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### FTIR Data:
- A **very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
- A **strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹** suggests a carbonyl group (C=O), possibly from an ester, ketone, or carboxylic acid.
- A **strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹** could correspond to a conjugated carbonyl group or aromatic C=C stretching.

### ¹H NMR Data:
- Peaks corresponding to **vinyl hydrogens** (H attached to a double bond) indicate the presence of a double bond, likely in an alkene or aromatic ring.

### Mass Spectrometry Data:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** suggests a small, stable fragment, possibly from a carbonyl-containing group or a simple organic fragment.

### Molecular Formula Options:
1. **C6H12O2**: Molecular weight = 116, degrees of unsaturation = 1 (one ring or double bond).
2. **C6H10O**: Molecular weight = 98, degrees of unsaturation = 2 (a ring and a double bond or two double bonds).
3. **C6H10O2**: Molecular weight = 114, degrees of unsaturation = 2 (a ring and a double bond or two double bonds).
4. **C6H12O**: Molecular weight = 100, degrees of unsaturation = 1 (one ring or double bond).

### Analysis:
- The **broad O-H stretch** and the presence of a carbonyl group suggest the compound contains at least two oxygen atoms, narrowing the options to **C6H12O2** (A) and **C6H10O2** (C).
- The **vinyl hydrogens** in the NMR indicate a double bond, requiring at least one degree of unsaturation. The **1650 cm⁻¹** IR peak further supports the presence of a conjugated system, such as a double bond adjacent to a carbonyl group.
- The **fragment at m/z = 45** in the mass spectrum is consistent with a small, stable fragment, possibly from a carbonyl-containing group.

### Degrees of Unsaturation:
- **C6H12O2** has 1 degree of unsaturation, which is insufficient to account for both a double bond and a ring.
- **C6H10O2** has 2 degrees of unsaturation, which can account for a ring and a double bond, fitting the data better.

### Conclusion:
The compound must have two oxygen atoms, a double bond, and a ring, making **C6H10O2** the most plausible formula. This aligns with the IR, NMR, and mass spectrometry data.
