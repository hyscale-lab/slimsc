Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (i.e., a statistical mixture of states) rather than pure.

The question asks about the geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm. I think when they say qubits space, they're referring to the Bloch sphere representation. Because qubits can be represented as points on a unit sphere, right? So each qubit state corresponds to a point on the Bloch sphere.

Wait, but wait. The density matrix given is for a mixed state. How does that translate to the Bloch sphere? I remember that for a pure state |ψ>, the density matrix is |ψ><ψ|, and it's represented as a vector on the Bloch sphere. But for mixed states, the density matrix is a statistical mixture, so like a convex combination of projectors.

In this case, our ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|) multiplied by 1/2. So that's a 50% mixture of |0> and |1>. Each of these is a pure state. The |0> state is at (1,0,0) on the Bloch sphere, and |1> is at (–1,0,0), wait no, maybe I'm mixing up the axes. No, wait, the Bloch sphere uses the standard basis where |0> is (1,0,0) and |1> is (−1,0,0)? Or wait, no, maybe I have that reversed. Let me think: the Bloch vector for |0> is (1,0,0) because that's the positive x-axis. And |1> is (−1,0,0), because that's the negative x-axis when using the standard convention where the Pauli matrices correspond to the x, y, z axes.

But wait, the density matrix ρ given here is an equal mixture of |0> and |1>. So how does that look on the Bloch sphere? I think the density matrix for a mixed state ρ = pρ₁ + (1-p)ρ₂ corresponds to a point that's the weighted average of the Bloch vectors of the pure states. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about that. Another approach: Maybe the density matrix ρ can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector r, and then we can find r.

I remember that any density matrix for a single qubit can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ represents the Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector. So the general form is ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2.

So let's compute this for the given ρ. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let's compute |0><0| and |1><1| in terms of the Pauli matrices.

Wait, I know that |0><0| can be written as (I + σ_z)/2. Similarly, |1><1| is (I - σ_z)/2. Let me verify that:

σ_z is [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. So (I + σ_z)/2 would be [[1,0],[0,1]] + [[1,0],[0,-1]] divided by 2. So that gives [[1,0],[0,1]] when added, then divided by 2: [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5 + ( -0.5?) Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recalculate.

Wait, |0> is [1,0]^T. So |0><0| is a matrix with 1s where the outer product is. So |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]].

But I remember that |0><0| can be written as (I + σ_z)/2. Let's see: (I + σ_z) is [[1+1,0],[0,1-1]] which is [[2,0],[0,0]]. Divided by 2, that becomes [[1,0],[0,0]], yes, exactly |0><0|. Similarly, (I - σ_z)/2 is [[1-1,0],[0,1+1]]/2 → [[0,0],[0,1]], which is |1><1|. So that's correct.

So the given ρ is [ |0><0| + |1><1| ] / 2. Substituting each term:

|0><0| = (I + σ_z)/2
|1><1| = (I - σ_z)/2

So together, |0><0| + |1><1| = [ (I + σ_z)/2 + (I - σ_z)/2 ] = (2I)/2 = I.

Wait, that's interesting. So ρ = (I)/2. Because |0><0| + |1><1| equals I. So ρ = I/2.

So the density matrix is (I/2), which is the completely mixed state for a single qubit. The completely mixed state is the maximally mixed state, which corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere. Because in Bloch sphere terms, the density matrix is (I + r·σ)/2. If r is zero, then ρ is I/2. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0).

So looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). That must be the correct answer.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state that is an equal statistical mixture of the pure states \(\left|0\right\rangle\) and \(\left|1\right\rangle\). To analyze its geometrical position in the qubits space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, any density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma},
\]

where \(\mathbf{r}\) is the Bloch vector, \(I\) is the identity matrix, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. The Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) determines the position of the state on the Bloch sphere.

For the given \(\rho\), substituting \(\left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| = \frac{I + \sigma_z}{2}\) and \(\left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| = \frac{I - \sigma_z}{2}\), we find:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{I + \sigma_z}{2} + \frac{I - \sigma_z}{2} \right) = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is represented by the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), as there is no directional preference in the Bloch sphere. Thus, the geometrical position of \(\rho\) in the qubits space is at the center of the Bloch sphere.

From the options provided:

- **A) \(r = (1,1,0)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state on the Bloch sphere.
- **B) \(r = (0,0,1)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state along the \(z\)-axis.
- **C) \(r = (0,0,0)\):** Correct, as this represents the completely mixed state at the center of the Bloch sphere.
- **D) \(r = (1,1,1):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to any valid qubit state.
