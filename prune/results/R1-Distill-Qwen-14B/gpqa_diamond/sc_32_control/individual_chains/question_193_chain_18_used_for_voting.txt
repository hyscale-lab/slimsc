Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says.

The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance. The specific information given is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 divided by parallax to the fifth power, so N ∝ 1/parallax^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. The options are A to D, with various exponents on r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d) in parsecs. So, plx = 1/d. Wait, or is it the other way around? Oh right, because closer stars have larger parallaxes. So if d is larger, plx is smaller.

So plx = 1/d. Or wait, maybe I should write it as d = 1/plx, since parallax is in arcseconds. So when plx increases, d decreases. That makes sense because if a star is closer (smaller d), its parallax is larger.

But in the problem, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. So N ∝ (1/plx)^5, which would be the same as d^5 because d is 1/plx. Wait, no, because if plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 would be d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So I think this is about the number density or the count in a given volume. But wait, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think again. If N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and since plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So N ∝ d^5. But that would imply that as distance increases, the number of stars increases as d^5. But that can't be right because stars are less dense at larger distances. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no. The number of stars per unit area (or in a given part of the sky) is what's given here. So N is the number of stars in a region, and it's proportional to 1/plx^5. So as plx decreases (because d increases), 1/plx^5 would increase, so N would increase. But that doesn't make sense because when you're looking further away, you should see fewer stars, not more. Or wait, maybe it's the opposite.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think: In astronomy, the number of stars you observe in a certain direction depends on the density of stars along that line of sight. So if you have a higher density of stars at some distance, you might see more in that direction. But when you move further away, the volume you're looking at increases, but the density of stars might change.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d. So the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r (I think here, since the question refers to distance r), would depend on the volume of that shell and the density of stars at that distance.

Wait, but the question says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so plx = 1/d (if d is in parsecs). So 1/plx = d. So N ∝ (1/plx)^5 = d^5.

So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, that suggests that as distance increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power. That doesn't make sense because in reality, the number of stars in a given volume (like a shell) would depend on the density. If the number per unit volume decreases with distance, perhaps due to the Galaxy's structure, then the total number could have a certain dependence.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering a region where the density of stars doesn't change with distance, but the number observed depends on how much volume we're looking into.

Wait, another approach: The number of stars observed in a direction is N = n × volume, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume). But if n is constant, then N would be proportional to the volume. But the volume depends on the solid angle and the distance. Wait, solid angle is a two-dimensional measure, so for a given solid angle, the volume of a shell at distance r with thickness dr is approximately 4π (r^2) × dr × solid angle. But perhaps the problem is assuming that the number of stars per unit volume is constant. So N ∝ volume ∝ r^2 dr.

Wait, but the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is N ∝ (d)^5. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars increases as d^5. But that's not matching with the earlier thought about volume. So maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps the key is to connect parallax to distance, then find how N depends on r.

Given N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, 1/(plx) = d. So 1/(plx)^5 is d^5. Thus, N ∝ d^5.

So as d increases, N increases as d^5.

But the question is, how does the number of stars change with distance (per unit range of distance, r). So perhaps they are asking about the rate of change of N with respect to r. That is, dN/dr.

Wait, because the number of stars per unit distance would be the derivative of N with respect to r. But the question says 'per unit range of distance, r'—so maybe it's the differential, the change in N as r increases by a unit.

Wait, if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr is proportional to r^4. Because derivative of r^5 is 5 r^4. So dN/dr ∝ r^4.

But looking at the options, option C is r^4. So the change in number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the question again.

The question states: How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?

Wait, perhaps they're not considering the change, but the total number as a function of r. So N ∝ r^5. But the options have B) ~ r^5 as one of them.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the number of stars per unit volume, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's think about the relation again. The number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to d (because plx = 1/d), N is proportional to d^5. So as d increases, N increases as d^5.

Therefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky increases as r^5. So the correct answer would be option B) ~ r^5.

Wait, but wait another thing. The number of stars in a region of the sky would increase with distance only if the density of stars is increasing, but that's not the case. Typically, the number of stars in a given volume doesn't increase with distance, but perhaps in this specific scenario, it's given that N is proportional to 1/plx^5, which would mean N increases with d^5.

So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait—another perspective. Maybe the number of stars is observed per unit area. So when you look further away, the same number density would mean fewer stars per unit area, but perhaps in this case, the number of stars actually increases with distance.

Wait, the relation given is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Parallax is in arcseconds, so for a star at distance d (in parsecs), plx = 1/d. So 1/plx = d, so N ∝ d^5.

Thus, N increases as d^5. So for each unit increase in d, the number of stars in that region increases by d^5. So the correct answer would be option B, ~r^5.

The question involves determining how the number of stars in a specific region of the sky changes with distance, given that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\(\text{plx}\)) is inversely related to distance (\(d\)), such that \(\text{plx} = \frac{1}{d}\). Substituting this into the given relation, \( N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{d}\right)^5} = d^5 \). This means the number of stars increases as \(d^5\), or equivalently \(r^5\), where \(r\) represents distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. Since \(N \propto r^5\), the number of stars grows proportionally to \(r^5\). Among the options provided, the correct answer is therefore:

**A) ~ \(r^3\):** Incorrect, as the dependence is not cubic.  
**B) ~ \(r^5\):** Correct, as derived from the given relation \(N \propto r^5\).  
**C) ~ \(r^4\):** Incorrect, as this would imply a different dependence.  
**D) ~ \(r^2\):** Incorrect, as this does not match the given relation.

Thus, the number of stars in the region increases as \(r^5\).
