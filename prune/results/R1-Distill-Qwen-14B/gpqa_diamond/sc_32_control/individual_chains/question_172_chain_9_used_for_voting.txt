Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me start by recalling what I know about stellar atmospheres and LTE.

So, the question says that in star 1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star 2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the population of energy levels in atoms depends on temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

I think the Boltzmann equation comes into play here. The Boltzmann distribution tells us the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is something like n_upper/n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights, ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the problem says that the excitation is twice as much in star 1. So, the ratio for star 1 would be (n_upper1/n_lower1) = 2 times that of star 2, which is (n_upper2/n_lower2). Let me denote the ratios as R1 and R2. So R1 = 2 * R2.

Let me write the Boltzmann equations for both stars. For star 1: R1 = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)). Similarly for star 2: R2 = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)). Wait, wait, but wait—assuming that the ions are the same in both stars, the statistical weights g_upper and g_lower would be the same for both, so the ratio g1/g2 would be the same in both equations. So when I take the ratio of R1 to R2, those g factors would cancel out.

So R1/R2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))]. Simplify that, the exponents subtract: exp[ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1)]. Because when you divide exponents with the same base, you subtract them. So it's exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1)).

But wait, R1 is 2 * R2. So R1/R2 = 2. So 2 = exp[ ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ].

Taking the natural logarithm on both sides: ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1).

Let me rearrange that: ΔE/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2). Or,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) * k / ΔE.

Wait, but the question is about finding the correct equation relating T1 and T2. So, looking at the options, which one matches this form?

Let me see. The left side is (1/T2 - 1/T1). Hmm. Let's factor that to see if any option can be manipulated into this form.

Let me factor the left side: 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = (ln 2) * k / ΔE.

Wait, but the question only gives us the relation between T1 and T2 via the equation, without the constants. Because the problem is giving us an energy difference, but the options don't involve ΔE or k. So perhaps the equation we get is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = [ln(2)] * (k / ΔE).

But the options are about the equation for ln(2) in terms of T1 and T2. Let me look again.

Wait, the equation we have is ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1). Alternatively, that can be written as ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ). Rearranged, that's ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) * ΔE ] / (k T1 T2 ).

But wait the options don't include ΔE, so perhaps it's just about the structure of the equation in terms of T1 and T2.

Looking at the options:

Option D: ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ]

Hmm, that's the same as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2), but according to our equation, it's [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ] multiplied by (ΔE/k) equals ln(2). So the option would be ln(2) equals that fraction times (ΔE/k). But the options don't give any constants, so perhaps the key is the structure.

Wait, maybe the given energy difference is a specific value, but the problem is only about the form of the equation. So the correct equation is ln(2) equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) multiplied by (ΔE/k). But since the options don't include ΔE or k, perhaps the question is considering only the ratio of the temperatures, assuming that ΔE/k is a constant, but the options don't include that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the arrangement. Let me think again.

We have:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1).

Which is the same as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * ( (T1 - T2) )/(T1 T2) )

But the options don't include ΔE or k, so perhaps the equation is being presented in terms of T1 and T2 without the energy term, so the equation without the multiplier. So the equation in the options would have ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which is option D.

Wait, but option D is ln(2) equals (T1-T2)/(T1 T2). So that's exactly what we have, except for the constants. But maybe in the problem, the energy difference and constants are such that it's simplified, but in the options, the correct structure is option D.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because when I rearranged the equation, I had:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

But none of the options have ΔE or k. So perhaps the problem is not considering the constants and only the form of the equation in terms of T1 and T2.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Which would match if the equation I derived is correct, but only if the other terms are incorporated into the equation as given. So perhaps the correct equation is option D.

Another way: Let me think about the original setup. The excitation in star 1 is twice that of star 2. So R1 = 2 R2.

From Boltzmann, R1/R2 = exp[ (ΔE/k)(1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ]

So 2 = exp(ΔE/k [1/T2 - 1/T1])

Take ln: ln2 = (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1)

Which is the same as ln2 = (ΔE/k)( (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) )

But since the question is about the equation for T1 and T2, perhaps they are considering that the energy difference and the constant (k) are known, so the equation simplifies to ln2 equals (T1-T2)/(T1 T2). Hence, option D.

Alternatively, maybe I messed up the sign. Because 1/T2 -1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So if T1 is hotter than T2, then T1-T2 is positive. So if star_1 has higher excitation, that would imply higher temperature, because higher temps make more excitation.

Wait, but the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So star_1's photosphere is hotter. So T1 > T2.

So (T1 - T2) is positive, and so (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) would be positive. Ln(2) is positive. So the equation would have a positive value.

So the equation ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) would make sense. So that's option D.

To determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of the two stars, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the relative populations of energy levels in a system in LTE. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_{\text{upper}} \) and \( g_{\text{lower}} \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

For star 1 and star 2, the excitation ratio is given as \( R_1 = 2 R_2 \), where \( R_1 = \frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} \) for star 1 and \( R_2 = \frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} \) for star 2. Assuming the statistical weights \( g_{\text{upper}}/g_{\text{lower}} \) are the same for both stars, the ratio of the excitation ratios becomes:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Since \( R_1/R_2 = 2 \), we have:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rearranging the terms:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

The problem asks for the equation relating \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \), and the options do not include constants like \( \Delta E \) or \( k \). Therefore, we focus on the structure of the equation. The correct form is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
