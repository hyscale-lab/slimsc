Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me see... The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function given some conditions. Hmm, I remember that the wave function must be normalized because probabilities have to add up to 1.

The wave function provided is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, or is it a/(sqrt(1 +x)) minus 0.5i? Oh, right, the way it's written in the question, that's what it is. So it's a complex function because there's an 'i' which is the square root of -1.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave function can be complex, right? But normalization requires the integral of the absolute square of the wave function to be 1. Oh, but looking at the problem, the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this interval. But in the given function, when x is less than 1 or greater than 3, the wave function isn't zero. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, the question says that when they measured the position, all particles were found between x=1 and x=3, so the wave function must be zero outside this range. But the given function doesn't show that. Hmm, maybe the given wave function is only valid between x=1 and x=3. So perhaps the wave function is zero elsewhere, but the part we're given is the non-zero part.

So the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

Let me compute |ψ(x)|². Since ψ is a complex function, its absolute square is ψ*(x) * ψ(x). So ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1+x)] - 0.5i. So ψ*(x) would be [a / sqrt(1+x)] + 0.5i.

Multiplying them together: [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5i)(-0.5i) + [a/(sqrt(1+x)) * 0.5i + a/(sqrt(1+x)) * (-0.5i)]. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two complex numbers, it's (a + ib)(a - ib) = a² + b². Wait wait, no, wait. Let me think. The given ψ is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ* is (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So the product is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2, because the imaginary parts multiply to (i)(-i) = 1. So yeah, |ψ(x)|² is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me compute that again. Let me denote ψ = A + B i, where A is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and B is -0.5. Then ψ* is A - B i. So ψ*ψ is (A + Bi)(A - Bi) = A² + B². So yes, that's right. So |ψ(x)|² is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx equals 1.

Let me separate this into two integrals: a² ∫ [1/(1+x)] dx from 1 to 3 plus ∫ 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

Compute each integral.

First integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(x+1) dx is ln(x+1). Evaluated from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3. The integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So putting it all together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Therefore, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a squared is approximately 0.7213, so a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.8495. Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which seems close.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the setup.

Wait, the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i.

So ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i.

Then ψ*(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i.

Multiplying together:

[ a^2/(1+x) ) + (a/(sqrt(1+x)))(0.5i) - (0.5i)(a/(sqrt(1+x))) ) + (0.5i)(-0.5i) ]

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to remember that for ψ = a + bi, the absolute square is a² + b².

So in this case, a is (a/sqrt(1+x)), and b is -0.5. So ψ*ψ = a²/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Yes, that's correct.

So the integral becomes the sum of a²*(ln(2)) + 0.25*(2) = 1.

Which simplifies to a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

a squared is 0.5 / ln(2). Let me calculate that.

ln(2) is approximately 0.69314718056.

So 0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.721347.

So a is sqrt(0.721347) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which would be the closest. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me check.

Wait, the integral is from x=1 to x=3. Let me recheck the integrals.

First integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

That's ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2), correct.

Second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5, correct.

So the calculation seems correct. So a would be approximately 0.849, which is around 0.85, so option B.

Wait, but why the wave function includes the term -0.5i? Does that affect the normalization? Because when I took the absolute square, the imaginary part contributed 0.25. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but if the wave function was purely real, the absolute square would be (a^2)/(1+x). But here, because it's complex, the absolute square is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. So the integral is a sum of two terms.

So yes, the calculation stands. So the value of 'a' is sqrt(0.7213) approximately 0.849, so 0.85 when rounded to two decimal places. So the correct answer is option B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function, which requires that the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space equals 1. The given wave function is:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The absolute square of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The particle is confined to the region \( x \in [1, 3] \), so the normalization condition is:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two separate integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 1
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Rearranging for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \), we calculate:

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, \( a \approx 0.85 \). Comparing this to the options, the closest value is **B) 0.85**.
