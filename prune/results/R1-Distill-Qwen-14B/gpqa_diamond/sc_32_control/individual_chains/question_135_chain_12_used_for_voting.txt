Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Hmm, it's about particle physics and decay modes of a boson. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions is given by a Lagrangian term. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf f-bar ψ_f (y)(υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think maybe I'm misreading that. Oh right, the standard form for a Yukawa interaction is something like L = -g ψ ψ X, where X is the boson field. So in this case, the term would be λ times some fermion fields multiplied by X. Maybe it's a Yukawa coupling term.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. I'm supposed to find the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, the possible decay products have to have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because, for a decay to happen, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle.

So X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. But which fermions are possible? The fermions must have a mass small enough such that twice their mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because each fermion in the pair has mass m, so 2m ≤ 6 GeV gives m ≤ 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait, what about particles like top quarks? Oh no, the top quark is way heavier. Its mass is around 173 GeV, so way above 3 GeV. So top quarks can't be decay products. Same with particles like the B quark, which I think is about 5 GeV or so. Wait, but let me check the masses of the fermions.

Let me list the known fermions and their masses (approximate):

Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
Up quark (u): ~2.2 MeV (so ~0.0022 GeV)
Down quark (d): ~4.7 MeV (~0.0047 GeV)
Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
Strange quark (s): ~100 MeV (~0.1 GeV)
Bottom quark (b): ~4.7 GeV
Top quark (t): ~173 GeV
For leptons, the charged ones are e, μ, τ, and their anti-particles. For quarks, they come in pairs like uū, dđ, etc. But each quark has a color, but since the decay is into a pair, perhaps color isn't an issue here.

Wait, but when X decays into fermions, it would produce a pair of a fermion and its antifermion, right? So for each possible fermion species, as long as 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So m_X is 6 GeV, so m_f must be ≤3 GeV.

Let's see:

Electron: m=0.0005 GeV → allowed. So e+ e- is possible.
Muon: m=0.105 GeV → allowed. μ+ μ- possible.
Tau: m=1.78 GeV → 2*1.78 = 3.56 GeV >6 GeV? Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, the mass of tau is about 1.78 GeV. So 2*1.78 = 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau pair is allowed.

Charm quark: m=1.5 GeV → 3 GeV total. So c c-bar is allowed.

Strange quark: m=0.1 GeV → 0.2 GeV, so s s-bar allowed.

Up quark: 0.0022 → 0.0044, so u ū allowed.

Down quark: 0.0047 → 0.0094, so d đ allowed.

What about bottom quark? m=4.7 GeV. So 2*4.7=9.4 GeV >6 GeV. So b b-bar is not allowed. So X can't decay into b b-bar because the mass is too high.

What about other fermions, like the right-handed neutrinos? But the problem doesn't mention those, and I think the standard model doesn't have right-handed neutrinos in the Lagrangian for such interactions. So probably, the decay would only consider the charged leptons and quarks.

So the possible decay channels would include:

e+ e-,

mu+ mu-,

tau+ tau-,

u ū,

d đ,

s s̄,

c c̄.

Wait, but wait. For the tau lepton, 2*m_tau is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV, so yes, allowed.

But what about the charged bosons, like W or Z? No, because the problem is about the interaction with fermions, not other bosons. So X can't decay into W+W- or something; it's just fermion pairs.

So looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b-bar, s s̄, u ū, d đ, τ+ τ-, e+ e-.

But wait, the b quark is 4.7 GeV, so 4.7*2 is 9.4 GeV >6 GeV. So b b-bar is not allowed. So option A is wrong.

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

So the fermions allowed would be e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c. Their masses are all ≤3 GeV (since 2m ≤6). So this seems correct.

Option C: X→c c̄, etc., plus t t̄. No, because t's mass is ~173 GeV, way too big. So C is wrong.

Option D: X→b b-bar, etc. But b is too heavy. So D is wrong.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the quark masses. For the c quark, I thought it's about 1.5 GeV. So 2m_c is 3 GeV, which is within 6 GeV. So c c̄ is allowed.

The s quark is about 100 MeV, so 2m is 0.2 GeV, allowed.

So option B includes all the allowed fermion pairs except the b quark. So the correct decay modes would include:

c c̄,

s s̄,

u ū,

d đ,

tau+ tau-,

mu+ mu-,

e+ e-.

Which matches option B.

Wait, but wait another point: the interaction term given is λ f f-bar X. So the coupling is to all the fermions in the term, which would mean that X can decay into any of the fermions that have this coupling. So if the interaction term is written as λ f f-bar X, it implies that X couples to all fermions f. So the fermions that can be produced are all the ones present in the interaction term.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the interaction is written as L(y) = -λ f f-bar ψ_f(y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting that. Maybe it's more like a Yukawa term where X couples to a specific type of fermion. Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the Lagrangian is written as -λ f ψ_f (y) X(y) ψ_f(y), but I'm not entirely sure. Because the given expression seems a bit unclear. Or perhaps it's a typo, and it's supposed to be something like -λ X ψ ψ, which is the standard Yukawa coupling term.

Assuming that the X boson is coupled to all fermions, then any fermion pair with 2m_f ≤6 GeV can be produced. So that includes all the leptons (e, mu, tau) and the lighter quarks (u, d, s, c). So that's exactly what option B lists.

So the correct answer should be option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction term provided. The decays are governed by the requirement that the combined rest mass of the decay products must not exceed the mass of \( X \). The interaction term suggests that \( X \) couples to fermions, and the possible decay products are fermion-antifermion pairs.

To determine the allowed decays, the masses of the fermions are considered:

- **Electron (\( e \))**: \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_e = 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
- **Muon (\( \mu \))**: \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\mu = 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
- **Tau (\( \tau \))**: \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau = 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
- **Up quark (\( u \))**: \( m_u \approx 0.0022 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_u = 0.0044 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
- **Down quark (\( d \))**: \( m_d \approx 0.0047 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_d = 0.0094 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
- **Strange quark (\( s \))**: \( m_s \approx 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_s = 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
- **Charm quark (\( c \))**: \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c = 3.0 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
- **Bottom quark (\( b \))**: \( m_b \approx 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b = 9.4 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed (exceeds \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
- **Top quark (\( t \))**: \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed (far exceeds \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).

From this analysis, the allowed decays of \( X \) are:

\[
X \rightarrow e^+ e^-, \, \mu^+ \mu^-, \, \tau^+ \tau^-, \, u \bar{u}, \, d \bar{d}, \, s \bar{s}, \, c \bar{c}.
\]

Now, evaluating the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed due to the high mass of the \( b \)-quark. **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Lists all allowed decays (\( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \)) and excludes \( b \bar{b} \). **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed due to the extremely high mass of the \( t \)-quark. **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
