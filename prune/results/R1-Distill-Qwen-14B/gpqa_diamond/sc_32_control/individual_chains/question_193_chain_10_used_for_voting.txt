Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So the equation is N = 1 / (plx)^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r. The options are various powers of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (p) is the reciprocal of distance (d) in parsecs, right? So p = 1/d. So if the parallax is smaller, the distance is larger.

Wait, the given relation is N ‚àù 1/(p^5). So N is inversely proportional to p^5. But since p is 1/d, substituting that in, so N would be proportional to d^5, because 1/( (1/d)^5 ) is d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So I'm thinking about the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r, with thickness dr. That's like the number density as a function of distance.

So if N is proportional to d^5, but to find how the number changes with distance, I think I need to find dN/dr, the derivative. Because dN/dr would give the change in number with distance.

So if N = k * d^5, where k is some constant, then taking the derivative with respect to d:

dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the change in number per unit distance is proportional to d^4.

Wait, but looking at the options, one of them is r^4. So option C is ~r^4. So the number of stars increases with r^4 as distance increases.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check. The initial statement says the number varies with parallax as 1/p^5. So N = 1/p^5. Since p = 1/d, then N = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So for a thin shell between r and r+dr, the number of stars is proportional to d^5. So the number per unit distance is d^4 as the derivative. So yes, the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) increases as r^4.

So the correct answer should be option C: ~r^4.

The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax, \( \text{plx} \), as \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \). Parallax is related to distance \( r \) by \( \text{plx} = 1/r \), so substituting this into the relation gives \( N \propto r^5 \). 

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range, we consider the derivative \( dN/dr \), which represents the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto r^5 \), we find \( dN/dr \propto r^4 \). This means the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
