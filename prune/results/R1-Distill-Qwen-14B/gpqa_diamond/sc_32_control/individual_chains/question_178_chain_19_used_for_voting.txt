Okay, so I've got this question about the Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that in quantum field theory, the renormalizability depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constant. If the dimension is too negative, the theory might not be renormalizable.

Wait, so first I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should look at the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to be dimensionless because when you integrate it over spacetime (which has dimension 4), you get an action that's dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

Each field has its own mass dimension. Fermion fields ψ have dimension 3/2 each because, in four dimensions, the action for a Dirac field is ∫ψ̄ iγμ ∂μ ψ d^4x, which is dimensionless. So ψ̄ and ψ each have dimension 3/2.

What about F^{μν}? That's the field strength tensor for electromagnetism or something similar. The field strength is the derivative of the gauge field A. The gauge field A has dimension 1, because the covariant derivative is ∂ + i e A, and ∂ has dimension 1. So F^{μν}, being ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, would have dimension 2. Wait, because each derivative is dimension 1, and A is 1, so F is 1+1=2? Or wait, does F have dimension 2? Because for a photon field A, its dimension is 1, so each derivative brings in one, so F is 2.

Now, the term σ_{μν} is made from the gamma matrices and the commutator. The structure σ_{μν} is a Lorentz tensor, and each γ matrix is dimensionless. The commutator [γ_μ, γ_ν] is dimensionless because the gammas are matrices, no mass dimension. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless. So the product ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would have dimensions (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Because each ψ is 3/2, and σ is 0. So ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension 3.

So putting it all together: L_int = κ [ψ̄ σ F] would have each part's dimensions. Wait, wait, F is dimension 2, right? So the whole term ψ̄ σ F would be 3 (from ψ̄σψ) plus 2 from F? Wait no, wait, wait. Because the term is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, which is a product of four objects: ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}.

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-express the term. The term is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ multiplied by F^{μν}. So the term is (ψ̄ σ ψ) * F. So the dimensions would be (3) for the ψ terms plus 2 for F. So 3 + 2 =5? Wait, but the Lagrangian has to have dimension 4.

So the entire term in the Lagrangian is L_int = κ * (ψ̄ σ ψ F). So the dimension of this term is [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ] + [F]. So [κ] + 3 +2 = [κ] +5.

But each term in the Lagrangian must be dimension 4, because the Lagrangian density has dimension 4 (since action is dimensionless, and integrating over 4 dimensions). So  [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]= -1. So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Wait, but wait. Oh wait, wait. No, no. Because the term is κ multiplied by the product of those fields. So the dimension of L is [κ] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [σ] + [F]. Wait, no, the term is ψ̄ σ ψ F. So the dimensions are [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [σ] + [F].

Wait, no. Each ψ is 3/2, ψ̄ is 3/2 as well. σ is dimensionless, and F is 2. So [ψ̄] is 3/2, [ψ] is 3/2, [σ] is 0, [F] is 2. So total is (3/2)+(3/2)+0+2 = 3 +2=5. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimension 5. Hence, the entire term in the Lagrangian is κ multiplied by this, so the dimension of the term is [κ] +5. Since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]=-1.

So κ has a mass dimension of -1. Now, the next question: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling. In four dimensions, a coupling is renormalizable if its mass dimension is ≥0. Because, I think, the superficial degree of divergence is determined by the Feynman diagrams, and if the coupling has dimension d, then the superficial degree is D = 4 - (L × d), where L is the number of loops or something like that. Wait, no, maybe it's better to think in terms of the scaling of the coupling.

Wait, another approach. In a renormalizable theory, the coupling has a mass dimension ≥0. Here, [κ]=-1, which is negative. So that suggests that the theory is not renormalizable because the coupling has a dimension that's too negative. Because when you have a coupling with negative mass dimension, each vertex in a Feynman diagram would add a factor of κ, which has dimension -1. So as the number of vertices increases (like in higher-order terms), the dimension becomes more negative, leading to non-renormalizable interactions that require infinite renormalization.

So since [κ] is -1, which is less than zero, the theory is not renormalizable.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: dim -1, renormalizable → No, because dim is -1, so not ren.

Option B: dim 1, ren → No, because dim isn't 1.

Option C: dim -1, not ren → Yes, this fits.

Option D: dim 1, not ren → No.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless, and integration over spacetime (dimension 4) requires the Lagrangian to be dimensionless. Each term in the Lagrangian must therefore have mass dimension 4.

- The fermion fields $\bar{\psi}$ and $\psi$ each have mass dimension $\frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension 2.
- The object $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is dimensionless because it is constructed from the dimensionless $\gamma$ matrices and their commutator.

The product $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has the following mass dimension:
\[
[\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + 2 = 5.
\]

Since the Lagrangian term is proportional to $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$, the mass dimension of $\kappa$ must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

Thus, the mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$.

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. In this case, $[\kappa] = -1$, which is negative. A negative mass dimension implies that the theory is not renormalizable because the coupling constant becomes increasingly irrelevant at higher energy scales, leading to non-renormalizable interactions that require infinite renormalization.

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: $\left[\kappa\right]_M = -1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as $\kappa$ has a negative mass dimension, making the theory non-renormalizable.
- **Option B**: $\left[\kappa\right]_M = 1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the mass dimension of $\kappa$ is not 1.
- **Option C**: $\left[\kappa\right]_M = -1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Correct**, as $\kappa$ has a negative mass dimension, and the theory is not renormalizable.
- **Option D**: $\left[\kappa\right]_M = 1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the mass dimension of $\kappa$ is not 1.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
