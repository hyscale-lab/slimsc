Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. Inside this conductor, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, and there's an angle theta between l and s.

Hmm. I remember that when dealing with conductors and charges inside cavities, there's some induced charge behavior. Since the conductor is uncharged initially, when we put a charge +q in the cavity, the conductor must redistribute charges to maintain electrostatic conditions.

Wait, right. So the conductor being a conductor means the charges will move freely. The presence of +q inside the cavity will induce equal and opposite charges on the inner surface of the conductor. But since the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge equal to +q. Wait, no. Let me think again. The total charge of the conductor is zero. So the inner surface will have an induced charge of -q. Because the +q in the cavity attracts negative charges to the inner surface. Then, to keep the conductor neutral, the outer surface must have +q charge because the inner is -q, and the conductor's total is zero.

So, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So when looking at a point outside the conductor, the electric field should be the same as if all the charge +q were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Wait, no, because the outer charge distribution depends on the shape, but for a spherical conductor, the charges on the outer surface would arrange themselves spherically symmetrically. So the electric field outside would be as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor, but wait, no, because the charge on the outer surface is uniformly distributed. So the field outside is the same as that of a point charge +q at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface has a charge +q, so the field outside is due to that. So, for any point outside, the electric field is as if all the charge were at the center of the conductor. So the electric field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L², since L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but let me make sure. I'm getting a bit mixed up with the setup. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity is offset by s. The charge is inside the cavity. So the induced charges are on the inner surface of the conductor. Then, the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner -q.

Wait, no. The conductor was initially uncharged, so when +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q. Because the +q in the cavity induces -q on the inner surface. Then, since the conductor's total charge is zero (originally uncharged), the outer surface must have +q. Because inner is -q, outer is +q, so overall zero (since conductor's initial charge is zero). Or wait, conductor's initial charge is zero, so after placing +q in the cavity, the conductor's charge remains zero, so the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So the total charge on the conductor is (-q) + (+q) = 0, which is correct.

So when I'm looking for the electric field outside the conductor, it's due to the outer charge, which is +q. So the field outside is as if that +q is a point charge located at the center of the conductor. So, the electric field at point P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / (L)^2, right? Because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but the point P is at a distance l from the center of the cavity. The center of the cavity is s away from the center of the conductor. So, the displacement from the conductor's center to P is L, and l is the distance from the cavity's center. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since the outer charge distribution is spherically symmetric, the position of the charge inside the cavity (its offset) doesn't affect the external field. Because the conductor's outer charge is symmetric around its own center, regardless of the cavity's position.

Wait, but in reality, the conductor's inner surface charge is induced, and the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed only if the conductor is a perfect sphere and the inner cavity is also spherical. But in this problem, the cavity is spherical as well, so regardless of its position inside, the outer charge would still be spherically symmetric. So the electric field outside depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q, and the distance from the conductor's center.

So, the electric field at P would be the same as if a point charge q was located at the center of the conductor, and the distance from the center is L. So E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²).

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that expression. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me look at the other options to make sure I haven't missed anything.

Option A: E = (1/4πε₀) q/(l - s cosθ)^2. That looks like something considering the position of the charge's source, but in reality, the charge on the conductor's outer surface is symmetric, so the position of the cavity's center shouldn't matter. So this option might be incorrect.

Option C: E = (1/4πε₀) q/(l + s cosθ)^2. Similar reasoning, but adding. I don't think that's right either.

Option D: E = (1/4πε₀) q/(l²). That would imply that the field depends on l, which is the distance from the cavity's center, but since the conductor's outer charge is at the conductor's center, the distance should be L, not l. So D is not correct.

So, I think option B is correct.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity's center is separated by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor, and a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and a distance $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor to maintain electrostatic equilibrium. Since the conductor is initially uncharged, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge $+q$ to balance the total charge. The outer surface charge is uniformly distributed due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor.

For a point outside the conductor, the electric field is determined by the total charge on the outer surface, which is $+q$, and the distance from the center of the conductor. By the shell theorem, the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution depends only on the total charge and the distance from the center. Thus, the electric field at point $P$ is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
\]

This matches the expression in option B. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** and **Option C** involve terms like $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$ or $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which are not relevant for the electric field outside the conductor. The position of the cavity's center or the angle $\theta$ does not affect the external field due to the spherical symmetry of the outer charge distribution.
- **Option D** incorrectly uses $l$ (the distance from the cavity's center) instead of $L$ (the distance from the conductor's center), which is the correct distance for calculating the external electric field.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
