Alright, so I've got this question here about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that extends the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators are classified by their dimension, like dimension 6 operators, which are the most commonly studied.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, let me think about each symmetry. 

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think that in any relativistic theory, the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. Because the Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and SMEFT is an effective theory built from it. So all the operators should transform appropriately under the Lorentz group. That makes sense, so Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. But wait, isn't Poincare symmetry automatically satisfied in the context of effective field theories because the theory is formulated in a Lorentz-invariant way with translation invariance built in? Or does SMEFT specifically require Poincare symmetry? I'm a bit confused here. Or maybe in SMEFT, the operators are constructed such that they are Poincare invariant? Because Poincare includes translations, which are about shifting the spacetime coordinates, and in field theories, the fields are usually assumed to transform covariantly under Poincare. So maybe all operators must respect Poincare symmetry as well. So options 1 and 2 would be correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain. Because sometimes people mention only Lorentz symmetry when discussing SMEFT. Let me think again. Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz and translational symmetries. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it should include Poincare symmetry. So are both Lorentz and Poincare required?

Wait, but I think that in the SMEFT, the operators are written in a way that respects Poincare symmetry. Because the effective theory is constructed by adding higher-dimensional terms that are part of a renormalizable theory, so they have to have the same symmetries as the Standard Model, which includes Poincare. So both Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2) must be respected. So options 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, what about CP symmetry (3)? The Standard Model is CP-symmetric, but SMEFT can include operators that break CP. For example, certain dimension-6 operators can involve terms that are not CP-symmetric. So in SMEFT, operators don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. Therefore, I don't think all operators must respect CP. So 3 is not a required symmetry.

Then, CPT symmetry (4). I remember that in any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry must hold. Because the combination of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T) is a symmetry that arises from the principles of quantum field theory. Lorentz invariance implies CPT symmetry. So if all operators in SMEFT respect Lorentz symmetry, which they must, then they must also respect CPT symmetry. So 4 is a must.

So putting it together, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait a second. Or is Poincare symmetry automatically included when Lorentz is? Because Poincare is a broader symmetry that includes translations. But in the SMEFT, the operators are written in terms of fields that transform under Lorentz transformations and translations, so Poincare is respected.

Wait, but sometimes when people talk about the symmetries of individual operators, they might only specify Lorentz. But I think in this context, since the theory as a whole must have Poincare symmetry, all the operators must be built in a way that maintains that. So 1 and 2 are both required.

So the correct symmetries are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT).

Looking back at the options, option C is 1,2,4. That would be the correct choice.

To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a relativistic effective field theory, and all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. This is a fundamental requirement for consistency with the principles of relativity.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. Since SMEFT is formulated as a field theory, it inherently respects Poincaré symmetry. Therefore, all operators must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: While the Standard Model is CP-symmetric, SMEFT allows for operators that explicitly break CP symmetry. Thus, CP symmetry is not a requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental requirement in any Lorentz-invariant theory, as it arises from the principles of quantum field theory. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct combination is given by option C.
