Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the SMEFT. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The options are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare Symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, let me start by recalling what SMEFT is about. SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model (SM) by including higher-dimensional operators, which are suppressed by some high energy scale, like the Planck scale. These operators are organized by their dimension, with the Standard Model being the renormalizable part (dimension 4) and the higher-dimension terms being corrections.

Now, symmetries are crucial because they dictate which operators are allowed. The SM respects certain symmetries, and SMEFT should maintain those unless the interactions beyond the SM explicitly break them. But the question is about which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect.

Let's go through each symmetry:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: The Standard Model is Lorentz invariant. In SMEFT, the operators are constructed from the SM fields. Since the SM fields transform under Lorentz transformations, any operator built from them should respect Lorentz symmetry. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like spatial and temporal shifts). Since Lorentz symmetry is part of Poincare, but Poincare also includes things like momentum conservation. Wait, but in the SMEFT, the operators are local, so they should respect local symmetries. But wait, the question is about whether all operators must respect Poincare symmetry. Because SMEFT is built in a way that maintains the same symmetries as the SM, which includes Poincare. So I think Poincare symmetry is also a must. Hmm, but wait, Poincare includes things like translation symmetry, which relates to momentum. In effective field theories, you often have operators that are non-renormalizable, but they still respect the underlying symmetries. So SMEFT operators should respect Poincare as well.

Wait, but another thought: the SM is a Poincare-invariant theory. So when you add higher-dimensional operators, they must also be Poincare-invariant. So yes, all SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So option 2 is correct.

3. CP symmetry: The Standard Model isn't CP-symmetric. For example, the CKM matrix has CP violation. So the SMEFT doesn't require operators to respect CP symmetry. In fact, operators that violate CP (like those with higher-dimension terms leading to new CP phases) are allowed. So not all operators must respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is out.

4. CPT symmetry: The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, as far as we know. CPT is Charge, Parity, Time reversal. Since the SMEFT extends the SM, it must also respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must preserve CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

Wait, but wait. Are there any cases where an operator could violate CPT? I think in the SM, CPT is a fundamental symmetry, and for the theory to make sense, especially in quantum field theory, CPT must hold. So any extension, including SMEFT, must also respect CPT. So yes, all operators respect CPT.

Putting it together:

Which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect? Let's list the symmetries:

- Lorentz: yes (1)
- Poincare: yes (2)
- CP: no (3)
- CPT: yes (4)

So the correct options are 1, 2, and 4. Looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. So the correct answer is C) 1,2,4.

Wait, but wait again. Do all SMEFT operators have to respect Poincare symmetry? Because I'm a bit confused about whether that's a given or not. Let me think again. The Poincare group includes translations, which are connected to momentum conservation. In an effective theory, the operators are local, so they should respect the Poincare symmetry. Because each operator is a local operator in the SM field content, which transforms appropriately.

Yes, so 1 and 2 are correct. So the correct answer should include 1,2,4. That's option C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) extends the Standard Model (SM) by including higher-dimensional operators, which are suppressed by a high energy scale. These operators must respect the symmetries of the SM unless explicitly broken by the interactions beyond the SM. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SM is Lorentz-invariant, and SMEFT operators are constructed from SM fields. Since these fields transform under Lorentz transformations, all SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT operators are local and maintain the same symmetries as the SM, they must respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM is not CP-symmetric, as seen in phenomena like CP violation in the CKM matrix. SMEFT does not require operators to respect CP symmetry, and CP-violating operators are allowed. Thus, CP symmetry is not a must for all SMEFT operators.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM respects CPT symmetry, and any extension of the SM, including SMEFT, must preserve CPT symmetry. Therefore, all SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all SMEFT operators are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
