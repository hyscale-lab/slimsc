Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about energy levels and their lifetimes, and figuring out the energy difference needed to clearly distinguish between them.

Alright, the question says we have two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh wait, the energy-time uncertainty principle. It states that the uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is approximately equal to ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, I think the exact form is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/(2π) or something like that. Or maybe it's just ħ, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, right, the uncertainty principle is ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2. So for a state with a certain lifetime (Δt), the uncertainty in energy is ħ/(2Δt). So if the lifetime is shorter, the uncertainty is larger. That makes sense because if you know the time more precisely (shorter Δt), you can't know the energy as precisely.

So the idea is that to resolve two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you wouldn't be able to tell them apart. So the energy difference ΔE must be greater than the uncertainty for both states. Or wait, is it that the difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties? Hmm, maybe not. Because each state has its own uncertainty.

Wait, maybe each state's energy uncertainty is based on their own lifetimes. So for E1 with a lifetime τ1 =1e-9 sec, the uncertainty ΔE1 is ħ/(2 τ1). Similarly for E2, ΔE2 is ħ/(2 τ2).

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1, right? So the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1. For them to be distinguishable, ΔE must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. Or perhaps each uncertainty? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe each state's energy uncertainty is ΔE1 and ΔE2. But when you're trying to resolve two lines in a spectrum, the condition is that the separation between the lines (ΔE) should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of each line. Because each line has a certain width, so if the separation is larger than the sum, they don't overlap. That makes sense.

So, the formula I should use is ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s.

Let me calculate ΔE1: ħ/(2 τ1) = (1.05457e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) = 1.05457e-34 / 2e-9 = approximately 5.27e-26 J.

Wait, but the options are in electron volts, so I need to convert J to eV. I remember that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to convert from J to eV, divide by 1.602e-19.

So 5.27e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.29e-7 eV. So ΔE1 is about 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 is ħ/(2 τ2) where τ2 is 1e-8 s. So 1.05457e-34 / (2e-8) = 5.27e-27 J. Convert to eV: 5.27e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check these calculations.

Wait, τ1 is 1e-9 s, so for ΔE1: ħ/(2τ1) = (1.05457e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) = (1.05457e-34) / (2e-9) = 5.27285e-26 J.

Convert 5.27285e-26 J to eV: 5.27285e-26 / 1.602e-19 = approx 3.29e-7 eV. So yeah, that's correct.

For τ2 =1e-8 s, ΔE2 is (1.05457e-34)/(2e-8) = 5.27e-27 J. Convert to eV: 5.27e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV. Right.

So the sum of the uncertainties is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E1 and E2 needs to be greater than this sum to be distinguishable.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → 0.001 n eV, which is way smaller than 3.6e-7 eV. So no.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller, way too small.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → 1e-4 is way bigger than 3.6e-7. So this would work.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV → 1e-8 is smaller than 3.6e-7. So it's 0.01 times 3.6e-7. So even this is not enough.

Wait, 1e-8 is 0.00000001 eV, which is 1e-8 eV. The sum is 3.6e-7 eV, which is 3.6e-7 is 0.36e-6. So 3.6e-7 is larger than 1e-8, right.

But wait, 1e-8 is 0.00000001 eV, and 3.6e-7 is 0.00000036 eV. So the sum is 0.00000036 eV. The energy difference needs to be larger than that.

So for option C, 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is 100 times larger than 3.6e-7 (since 0.0001 is 1e-4, 3.6e-7 is 0.00000036). So 1e-4 is much bigger than the required sum. So that would work.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is less than the sum. So it's not sufficient.

So the correct answer should be C) 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think if there's another approach. Alternatively, the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy of each state individually. Because the uncertainty in energy for each state is ΔE1 and ΔE2. So perhaps the energy difference needs to be greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties?

Wait, no. Because the energy difference is between E1 and E2. Each has their own uncertainty. So the combined effect would be that the total uncertainty in the difference is the sum of the individual uncertainties.

Wait, no, actually, the energy uncertainty for each is the standard deviation. So when you have two separate uncertainties, the combined uncertainty in their difference would be sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ). But perhaps, for a rough estimate, it's approximated as the sum. But I'm not entirely sure about the proper way to combine them.

Alternatively, another approach: the lifetime of a state is the time over which its energy is measured. The uncertainty in energy is ΔE = ħ/(2τ). So for a state to have a well-defined energy, the lifetime must be long enough.

But when considering two different states, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in each state's energy. Because if the energy difference is on the order of the uncertainty, you can't distinguish them.

So perhaps, the condition is that (E2 - E1) > max(ΔE1, ΔE2). Or perhaps the sum.

Wait, earlier I thought the sum. Because each state has a line with a certain width. If their separation is larger than the sum of the half-widths, then the lines don't overlap. The half-width is the ΔE, perhaps. So for two lines, the separation must be greater than the sum of their half-widths.

So yes, ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

In that case, as I calculated earlier, the sum is 3.6e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be larger than that.

Looking back at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger than 3.6e-7 eV.

Wait, 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV.

Wait, let me recheck the numbers.

ΔE1 is 3.29e-7 eV.

ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV.

Sum is about 3.619e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than 3.619e-7 eV.

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger, so it's acceptable.

Other options:

A: 1e-9 = 0.001e-6 → 0.001e-6 eV is 1e-9, which is much smaller than 3.6e-7.

B: 1e-11 → even smaller.

D: 1e-8 → 0.00000001 eV, which is 1e-8, which is less than 3.6e-7.

So only option C satisfies ΔE > sum(ΔE1, ΔE2).

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy and \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state. For each state, the uncertainty in energy is given by:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_2},
\]

where \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). The reduced Planck's constant is \( \hbar \approx 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), and converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.05457 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}, \quad \Delta E_1 \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.05457 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}, \quad \Delta E_2 \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

The total uncertainty in energy is the sum of the individual uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \). Evaluating the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 1 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so this is also insufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**.
