Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by this Lagrangian: L(y) = -λf ψ_f̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to find the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

Wait, okay. I remember that when a particle decays, the energy (or mass) has to be at least the sum of the rest masses of the decay products. So X can decay into particles if its mass is greater than or equal to the combined rest mass of those particles.

Looking at the Lagrangian, the interaction term is proportional to X(y), right? So the X field couples to the fermions. That suggests that X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. Because in the Lagrangian, the interaction is like X ψ ψ, which looks like a Yukawa coupling. So X can decay into any fermions that it couples to.

Wait, but what fermions are involved here? The problem mentions λf, so I think λ is a coupling constant and f is the fermion type. So X can interact with any fermion f.

But the question is about the allowed decays kinematically. So I need to look at which fermion pairs have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let me list the masses of the known fermions. The up and down quarks are the lightest. Their masses are around a few MeV. Then comes the strange quark, maybe 50-100 MeV. The charm quark is about 1.5 GeV. The bottom quark is around 4.5-5 GeV. The top quark is way heavier, around 173 GeV. The electron is about 0.0005 GeV, muon ~0.1 GeV, tau ~1.777 GeV.

So each decay channel X → f f̄ requires that 2m_f ≤ M_X. M_X is 6 GeV.

Let me go through each option.

Option A: X→ b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ-, e+e−.

Wait, the bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV each. So 2m_b would be ~9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄. So option A is incorrect because it includes b b̄.

Option B: X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ-, μ+μ−, e+e−.

Check the masses. c is about 1.5 GeV, so 2m_c=3 GeV ≤6, so that's allowed. s is ~100 MeV, so 2m_s ~200 MeV. Also allowed. u and d are negligible, so their pair is allowed. The tau is ~1.77 GeV each, so 2m_tau would be ~3.54 GeV ≤6, allowed. For leptons: mu is 0.1 GeV, 2m_mu=0.2, which is okay. e is even lighter. So all these decays are allowed. So option B might be correct.

Option C: Includes t t̄. Top quark is 173 GeV, way more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into top quarks. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: Includes b b̄ again. As discussed earlier, 2m_b ~9 GeV >6 GeV. So D is incorrect.

So the correct option should be B because it includes all the fermions whose combined mass is ≤6 GeV, except for the top quark and bottom quark.

Wait wait, but wait. Let me think about the bottom quark again. The bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV. So 2 * 4.5 is 9 GeV, which is more than 6. So X can't decay into b b̄. So any option including b b̄ is out. So option D, which includes b, is wrong.

So the correct answer is option B. Let me check the options again.

Option B: c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+e−. All these have 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

Wait wait, wait. The tau pair is 2 * 1.777 GeV = 3.554 GeV. So that's allowed. The mu pair is 0.2 GeV, and e pair is negligible. So yes, all are allowed.

So the allowed decays are into c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau pair, mu pair, and e pair.

So the correct answer should be option B. So the answer is B.

To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we analyze the interaction Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (v + X(y)) \psi_f(y),
\]

which indicates that \( X \) couples to fermions \( f \). The decay \( X \rightarrow f \bar{f} \) is allowed if the combined rest mass of the fermion-antifermion pair satisfies \( 2m_f \leq M_X \), where \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses
- Up (\( u \)) and down (\( d \)) quarks: \( m_u, m_d \sim 1-5 \, \text{MeV} \) (negligible compared to 6 GeV).
- Strange (\( s \)) quark: \( m_s \sim 50-100 \, \text{MeV} \), so \( 2m_s \sim 100-200 \, \text{MeV} \), which is allowed.
- Charm (\( c \)) quark: \( m_c \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_c \sim 3 \, \text{GeV} \), which is allowed.
- Bottom (\( b \)) quark: \( m_b \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_b \sim 9 \, \text{GeV} \), which exceeds 6 GeV and is not allowed.
- Top (\( t \)) quark: \( m_t \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \), which is far greater than 6 GeV and not allowed.
- Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_e \sim 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \), which is allowed.
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_\mu \sim 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \), which is allowed.
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \sim 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_\tau \sim 3.554 \, \text{GeV} \), which is allowed.

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( X \rightarrow b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( X \rightarrow c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \). All these decays satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), so this option is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( X \rightarrow t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( X \rightarrow b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \rightarrow c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
