Okay, so I've got this question about a rhombohedral crystal and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on crystallography, but let me try to think this through.

First, I remember that in crystallography, interplanar distances are calculated using the Miller indices and the lattice parameters. Oh wait, the structure here is rhombohedral, which is a type of crystal system. So the unit cell is a rhombohedron, meaning all edges are equal and all angles are the same. The problem gives the interatomic distance as 10 Angstrom, but wait, interatomic distance is the distance between two adjacent atoms, right? So that would be the lattice parameter 'a' in a simple cubic structure. But in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters are a bit different. Oh wait, no—rhombohedral is a type of cubic system where all sides are equal but the angles are not necessarily 90 degrees. So in this case, the lattice parameter 'a' is 10 Angstrom.

The angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. Oh wait, but in a rhombohedral system, all three angles are equal, so that's correct.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by:

d_hkl = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + (2hk cos α) + (2hl cos β) + (2kl cos γ) )

Wait, but wait, no, that's not right. Oh, wait, the general formula for interplanar distance when the lattice is not necessarily cubic is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 (1/a^2) ) + (k^2 (1/b^2) ) + (l^2 (1/c^2) ) + ( ... some cross terms involving cosines of angles ... ) )

But in a rhombohedral system, all edges are equal, so a = b = c. Also, all the angles are equal, so α = β = γ = 30 degrees. So maybe there's a simpler formula here.

Wait, I think for a rhombohedral system, the formula simplifies because a = b = c and all angles are equal. So perhaps the interplanar distance formula becomes:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hk + hl) cos α )

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because in the general case of a cubic system (where angles are 90 degrees), the formula becomes d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). So in the cubic case, the cross terms vanish because cos 90 is zero. But for rhombohedral, the angles are not 90, so cos terms are non-zero.

Wait, let me think again. The general formula for interplanar distance in a non-cubic system is:

1/d² = (h²/(a²) + k²/(b²) + l²/(c²)) ) + (2hk cos γ)/(a b) + (2hl cos β)/(a c) + (2kl cos α)/(b c)

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0, and α = β = γ = θ (say, 30 degrees). So substituting:

1/d² = [h² + k² + l²]/a0² + [2hk cos θ + 2h l cos θ + 2k l cos θ]/(a0²)

Because each term like (2hk cos γ)/(a*b) becomes (2hk cos θ)/(a0^2), since a = b = a0.

So simplifying:

1/d² = [h² + k² + l² + 2hk cosθ + 2hl cosθ + 2kl cosθ ] / a0²

Which can be written as:

d = a0 / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cosθ + 2hl cosθ + 2kl cosθ )

But wait, that seems a bit complicated, but perhaps there's a way to factor this expression. Let me see.

The denominator inside the square root is [h² + k² + l² + 2hk cosθ + 2hl cosθ + 2kl cosθ ]

Hmm, if I factor that, perhaps as (h + k + l)^2, but no, because that would be h² +k² + l² + 2hk + 2hl + 2kl, which is different. Because the cross terms have cosθ, not 1.

Alternatively, perhaps we can factor it as (h + k + l)^2 but with cosθ. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe it's better to plug in the specific Miller indices given in the problem. The plane is (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1.

So substituting h=1, k=1, l=1:

d = a0 / sqrt( 1 + 1 + 1 + 2*1*1*cos30 + 2*1*1*cos30 + 2*1*1*cos30 )

Because each of the cross terms is 2 * h * k * cosθ, and all are cos30 since θ=30.

So let's compute the denominator:

1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Each cross term is 2 * 1 * 1 * cos30. There are three such terms (hk, hl, kl) each contributes 2 cosθ.

Wait no, wait the cross terms are 2hk cosθ, 2hl cosθ, 2kl cosθ. So for h=k=l=1, each of these is 2 * 1 * 1 * cos30.

So there are three cross terms, each 2 cos30. So 3 * 2 cos30 is 6 cos30.

So the denominator's numerator inside the sqrt is 3 + 6 cos30.

Compute that:

cos30 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660

So 6 * 0.8660 ≈ 5.196

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) is approximately sqrt(8.196). Let me calculate that.

Hmm, sqrt(9)=3, sqrt(8.196) is a bit less than 2.866. Wait, wait, let's compute it more accurately.

Wait 2.866 squared is (2.866)^2 = 8.211, so 2.866^2 is about 8.211, which is a bit higher than 8.196. So 2.866 is a bit bigger than the actual value.

Let me compute 2.86^2: 2.86 * 2.86 = 8.1796. Hmm, 2.86^2=8.1796. So 8.196 is a bit higher. So 2.86^2=8.1796, 2.87^2=8.2369.

So 8.196 is between 2.86 and 2.87. Let's compute the exact value.

Let me compute 2.865^2: (2.86 + 0.005)^2 = (2.86)^2 + 2*2.86*0.005 + (0.005)^2 = 8.1796 + 0.0286 + 0.000025 ≈ 8.208225. Hmm, 8.208 is higher than 8.196, so the square root is less than 2.865.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it more precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator approach. Let me think: 2.86^2 = 8.1796, 2.86^2 is 8.1796, and 8.196 is 0.0164 higher. So the difference is 0.0164. The derivative of x^2 is 2x, so the delta x is approximately 0.0164 / (2*2.86) ) ≈ 0.0164/(5.72) ≈ 0.002867. So sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.86 + 0.002867 ≈ 2.862867. So approximately 2.863.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

So the denominator is 2.863.

So d = a0 / 2.863. a0 is 10 Angstrom.

So d≈10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.49 Angstrom? Wait, no, wait, 10 / 2.863 is approximately 3.49? No, wait, 2.863 * 3 = 8.589, 2.863 * 3.49= approximately 2.863 *3=8.589, 2.863 *0.49=1.403, total 9.992, which is about 10. So 2.863 * 3.49 ≈10. So 10/2.863 ≈3.49. Wait, but that can't be right because the options are around 9 Angstrom.

Wait, I must have made a mistake. Hmm, wait a0 is 10 Angstrom. So 10 divided by 2.863 is around 3.49? But the options are all around 9 Angstrom. So I must have messed up the calculation somewhere.

Wait, no, I think I messed up the initial substitution in the formula. Let me think again about the formula.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Another approach: the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 / a^2) + (k^2 / b^2) + (l^2 / c^2) + ... cross terms ... )

But for a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0, and angles are the same.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²) / a0² + 2 (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) / a0²

Wait, since a = b = c, and α=β=γ=30 degrees, then:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos30 + 2hl cos30 + 2kl cos30) / a0²

Wait, that's what I used earlier. So for (111) plane, h=k=l=1, so:

1/d² = (1 + 1 + 1 + 2*1*1* cos30 + 2*1*1 * cos30 + 2*1*1 * cos30 ) / (10^2)

Which is (3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2)) / 100.

Wait, sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.8660, so 6*0.8660=5.196.

So 3 +5.196=8.196.

So 1/d² = 8.196 / 100 → 8.196e-2.

Wait, no, wait the denominator is a0 squared, which is 10^2 =100.

So 1/d² = 8.196 / 100 → 0.08196.

So d^2 = 1 / 0.08196 → approximately 12.205.

So d = sqrt(12.205) ≈ 3.49 Angstroms.

Wait, but that's about 3.49 Angstrom, but the options are around 9 Angstrom. So something's wrong here. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I confused a0 with something else. Wait, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. In a simple cubic structure, a0 would be 10 Angstrom. But in a rhombohedral structure, is a0 the same as the interatomic distance? Or is the interatomic distance different?

Wait, in a rhombohedral lattice, the interatomic distance refers to the distance between nearest neighbors. So if the structure is simple, say each atom is at the corners of the rhombohedron, then the nearest neighbor distance is the same as the edge length a0. So if the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, then a0=10 Angstrom.

So that part is correct.

Wait, but the interplanar distance can't be 3.49 Angstrom because all the options are about 9 Angstrom. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the equation.

Wait, maybe the formula I used is wrong. Let me check my notes. Oh wait, perhaps I forgot that in the formula, the denominator is the reciprocal of d squared, but perhaps I should have used a different approach.

Another way to think: the interplanar distance for (hkl) in a cubic system is a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). But in a non-cubic system, it's more complicated.

Wait, maybe I should use the Miller indices and the reciprocal lattice vectors. Oh, I might be overcomplicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the structure factor and Bragg's law, but that's not directly helpful here.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance is given by the formula d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hk + hl) cosθ ), but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up terms.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for rhombohedral is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, for (111), this would be:

d = 10 / sqrt(3 + 2*(1+1+1) cos30 )

Wait, because (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) is 3, and 2*(hk + hl + kl) would be 2*(1+1+1) =6, since each hk, hl, kl is 1*1=1.

So cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So 6 * 0.866 =5.196.

So denominator inside the sqrt is 3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)=approx 2.863.

So d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

Wait, but the options are A)9.08, B)8.95, C)9.54, D)10.05.

So 3.49 is nowhere near those. So I must have made a mistake in applying the formula.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is not a0. Maybe in rhombohedral, a0 is the edge length, but the interatomic distance is different, especially if it's not a simple cubic structure. Hmm, but the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps a0 is 10, but maybe the formula uses a different parameter.

Wait, perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in rhombohedral is different.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should find another approach. Let me think about the volume of the unit cell.

The volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos θ + 2 cos^3 θ ), where θ is the angle between edges. Or wait, perhaps it's a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos α + 2 cos^3 α ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relation between d and the reciprocal lattice. The interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector projected onto the plane.

The reciprocal lattice vector components are h, k, l, so the magnitude is sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ). Wait, but no, I think I'm mixing it up.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vector for (hkl) is (h, k, l) in reciprocal space. The magnitude of this vector is given by sqrt( (h/a)^2 + (k/b)^2 + (l/c)^2 + ... cross terms ) ), but for rhombohedral, perhaps it simplifies.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look for a formula specific to rhombohedral systems.

Wait, I found online that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, so that's the same formula I used earlier. So if that's the case, for (111):

d = 10 / sqrt(3 + 6 cos30 )

Which comes out to 3.49 Angstrom. But that's not matching any of the options.

Hmm, but the given options are all around 9 Angstrom. So perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula I should use is different. Another approach: The interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hkl)(1 - cosθ) )

Wait, I'm not sure, but perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps in a rhombohedral system, when all the angles are equal, the formula simplifies.

Wait, I might have to think differently. Let me consider that the interplanar distance for (111) in a cubic system would be a / sqrt(3). But in this case, the angles are 30 degrees, which would change the distance.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a general hexagonal system, but rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal? No, wait, hexagonal is different. Rhombohedral is a cubic system with non-right angles.

Wait, maybe I can use the formula for the interatomic distance in a cubic system, but adjusted for the angles.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the math.

Wait, for d = 10 / sqrt(8.196) → sqrt(8.196) is approximately 2.863.

So 10/2.863 ≈ 3.49 Angstrom.

But that's not matching the options. So perhaps I've made a wrong assumption about the formula.

Wait, maybe the correct formula uses (hkl) in a different way. Another approach: the interplanar distance is given by 1/d = (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) * a0^2 + ... something involving cosines.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a formula that's applicable to rhombohedral in terms of the unit cell parameters. Another resource I found suggests that for a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance is given by:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) * (a^2)/ (1 - 3 cos α + 2 cos^3 α) ) )

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

Which is the same as before.

Hmm, perhaps I should try plugging in the numbers again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula uses (h, k, l) in a different way, such as considering the plane's orientation. Hmm, that might not be the case.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the assumption that a0 is 10 Angstrom. Because in a simple cubic system, the interatomic distance is a0, but in a rhombohedral system, if the atoms are at the corners, the interatomic distance could be a0 multiplied by sqrt(3)/2, because in a face diagonal, the distance would be sqrt(2) a0, and body diagonal is sqrt(3) a0. But wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbors might be along the edges, so a0 is the interatomic distance. Hmm, but maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the edge length a0, which is 10 Angstrom. So that part is correct.

Wait, but then why the calculation gives a d of around 3.49, which is way off the given options. So I must have the formula wrong.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hkl)(1 - cosθ) )

I'm not sure, but perhaps. Let me try that.

For (111), hkl=1, so (hkl)=1.

So denominator inside sqrt: 3 - [1*(1 - cos30)] = 3 - (1 - 0.8660 ) = 3 - 0.134 = 2.866.

So sqrt(2.866)= approx 1.693.

So d =10 / 1.693 ≈5.927 Angstrom. Still not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should try another approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a0 * sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2 ) ) / ( ... something ... )

Wait, perhaps in the case of a cubic system with angles, the formula is d = a0 * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) ) / sqrt( (1 + 2 cos α) )

Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps for a face-centered cubic or something, but no, it's rhombohedral.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the volume of the unit cell and the relation to d-spacing. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the interplanar distance formula for rhombohedral is d = a0 / (sqrt( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )) ), which is the same as before. So with h=k=l=1, d=10/sqrt(3+6 cos30 )=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.49.

But the options are all around 9 Angstrom. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the edge length a0, and I should use that. No, that's what I did.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal, so d = 1 / (sqrt( ... ) * a0 ), but that would make d smaller, which is not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor in the formula. Another approach: maybe the formula should be d = a0 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, let me try that. For (111):

Denominator: 3 - 6 * cos30.

cos30 is approx 0.866, so 6*0.866=5.196.

3-5.196= -2.196. Can't square root a negative number. That's impossible, so the formula must not be this.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me try to recall from another perspective. In a cubic system (angles 90), d = a0 / sqrt(h² +k² +l²).

But in a rhombohedral, the angle is 30 degrees, so the formula changes to account for the angles.

Wait, I found a formula from a crystallography resource that says:

d = a0 / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 + l^2 + 2hk cosα + 2hl cosβ + 2kl cosγ )

Which is the same as what I used before. So for (111), it's 10 / sqrt(3 +6 cos30 )=10/ sqrt(8.196)=3.49.

But the options don't match that. So perhaps the question's options are incorrect, or I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the given angles are not the angles between the edges (as in the unit cell), but something else. But the question says α=β=γ=30 degrees, which are the angles of the crystal.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the reciprocal of the interplanar distance. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is different when the system is primitive or not. Hmm, but the (111) plane is probably in a primitive unit cell.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I should use the Laue equations or the structure factor, but I don't think that's necessary here.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a0 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) (1 - cosθ) )

Wait, let me try that. For (111), h=k=l=1.

Denominator: 3 - 2*(3) (1 - cos30 )

=3 -6*(1 -0.8660)

=3 -6*(0.134)=3 -0.804=2.196.

sqrt(2.196)≈1.481.

d=10 /1.481≈6.75 Angstrom. Still not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck on the wrong approach. Let me think about the possible values.

The options are around 9 Angstrom, which is close to the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom. So perhaps for the (111) plane, the interplanar distance is longer than the interatomic distance, which seems unlikely. Wait, no, in a cubic system, for example, the (111) plane has a d-spacing of a/sqrt(3) ≈0.577a. So if a=10, then d=5.77. That's less than a. So why are the options so much higher?

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the inverse. No, that can't be, because d is supposed to be the interplanar distance, which is smaller than the lattice parameter.

Alternatively, perhaps I should take the reciprocal of the denominator.

Wait, if I compute 1/sqrt(8.196) as 0.349, then 10 * 0.349=3.49.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a0 * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But that would give d=10 * sqrt(8.196) ≈10 *2.863=28.63, which is way too big.

No, that's not making sense.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the formula wrong because I'm using the wrong reciprocal. Let me think again about the formula.

Wait, in a general orthorhombic system, the interplanar distance is:

d = 1/ sqrt( (h^2/a^2) + (k^2/b^2) + (l^2/c^2) )

But in a rhombohedral, a=b=c, and all angles are the same. So perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 + l^2 + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ )

Which brings me back to the same calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me recheck.

Wait, 3 + 6 * cos30 =3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2 )=3 +3*sqrt(3). Because 6*(sqrt(3)/2)=3*sqrt(3).

So 3 +3*sqrt(3) =3(1 + sqrt(3)).

So sqrt(3)= approx 1.732. So 1 +1.732≈2.732.

So 3*2.732=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)= about 2.863.

So d=10 /2.863≈3.49.

But again, this doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not a0, but the distance between atoms in a different position. For example, in a body-centered or face-centered arrangement, the interatomic distance might be different.

Wait, but the question states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So in a simple cubic structure, a0 would be 10, but in a BCC, the interatomic distance is a0√3/2, so a0= (interatomic distance)*2/sqrt(3). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance in a rhombohedral structure is different. Maybe it's not simply a0. Let's think: in a rhombohedral structure, the atoms are at the corners. The nearest neighbors are along the edges, so the interatomic distance is a0. So a0=10.

Hmm, but then the calculation stays the same.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the question is about hexagonal close-packed or another structure, but no, it's rhombohedral.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the inverse of the denominator, but that would give a larger d. Wait, 10 * sqrt(8.196) ≈28.63. Not matching options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of something else, like the number of atoms per unit cell. But that shouldn't affect the interplanar distance.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance is for a different plane. The question says (111), but perhaps I should calculate for (200) or something else. No, the question clearly states (111).

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of 3.49, which is approx 0.286, but that's in reciprocal Angstrom, which doesn't make sense here.

Wait, I'm stuck. The calculation I'm confident in gives me approximately 3.49 Angstrom, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is d = a0 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hkl)(1 - cosθ) )

For (111), this would be:

sqrt(3 - 1*(1 - cos30) ) → sqrt(3 - (1-0.866)) → sqrt(3 -0.134)=sqrt(2.866)=1.693.

So d=10/1.693≈5.927 Angstrom, but still not matching the options.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Let me think of another approach. Maybe I can compute using vectors.

The interplanar distance can be found by finding the distance between two adjacent lattice planes. The (111) plane in a rhombohedral lattice can be determined using vectors.

Rhombohedral lattice vectors can be represented as:

a = a0 (1, 0, 0)

b = a0 (cosα, sinα, 0 )

c = a0 (cosβ, (cosγ - cosα cosβ)/(sinα), sinβ )

But in this case, α=β=γ=30 degrees.

So substituting:

a = (a0, 0, 0 )

b = a0 (cos30, sin30, 0) = a0*(sqrt(3)/2, 0.5, 0 )

c = a0 (cos30, [cos30 - cos30 * cos30 * cos30 ] / sin30, sin30 )

Wait, let's compute each component:

cos30 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660,

sin30=0.5.

So for the z-component of c:

sinβ = sin30=0.5.

The middle term is [cosγ - cosα cosβ cosγ ] / sinα.

Wait, no, general formula for c is:

c_x = cosβ,

c_y = [ cos γ - cos α cos β ] / sin α,

c_z = sin β.

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is more accurately:

c_x = cos β,

c_y = (cos γ - cos α cos β) / sin α,

c_z = sin β.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check. The third vector c in a rhombohedral system can be found using the following components:

c_x = cos β,

c_y = (cos γ - cos α cos β) / sin α,

c_z = sin β.

But since α=β=γ=30 degrees, let's substitute:

c_x = cos(30) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660,

c_y = [ cos(30) - cos(30) cos(30) ] / sin(30 )

= [ (sqrt(3)/2) - (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ] / (0.5 )

= [ (sqrt(3)/2) - (3/4) ] / (0.5 )

= [ (2 sqrt(3) -3 ) /4 ] / 0.5

= [ (2 sqrt(3) -3 ) /4 ] * 2 

= (2 sqrt(3) -3 ) / 2 ≈ (3.464 -3)/2 ≈0.464/2=0.232.

c_z = sin(30) = 0.5.

So vector c is (0.8660 a0, 0.232 a0, 0.5 a0 ).

Now, the (111) plane's normal vector is in the direction of the reciprocal lattice vector (1,1,1). The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

a* = (1, 0, 0 ),

b* = (0, 1, 0 ),

c* = (0, 0, 1 ).

But in rhombohedral coordinates, the reciprocal vectors are more complex. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the plane equation and find the distance.

The (111) plane equation is h a + k b + l c = (a + b + c) · r = 0.

Wait, more precisely, the plane can be represented as (1,1,1) · (x, y, z) = d, but in the lattice vectors.

But perhaps a better approach is to find the interplanar distance using the volume of the unit cell and the area of the plane.

The volume V of the unit cell is given by the scalar triple product of a, b, c vectors.

So V = | a · (b × c) |.

Compute b × c first.

b = a0*(sqrt(3)/2, 0.5, 0 )

c = a0*(sqrt(3)/2, 0.232, 0.5 )

So compute the cross product b × c.

Let me compute each component:

i (b_y c_z - b_z c_y ) - j (b_x c_z - b_z c_x ) + k (b_x c_y - b_y c_x )

But b_z=0, c_z=0.5 a0.

So,

i: (0.5 * 0.5) - (0 * 0.232) )=0.25 → 0.25 a0^2.

j: -( (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 ) - (0 * sqrt(3)/2 ) )= -( sqrt(3)/4 ) → -sqrt(3)/4 a0^2.

k: ( sqrt(3)/2 * 0.232 ) - (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 ) = ( sqrt(3)/2 * (0.232 - 0.5 ) )= ( sqrt(3)/2 ) * (-0.268 ) → -0.134 sqrt(3) a0^2.

So:

b × c = (0.25, -sqrt(3)/4, -0.134 sqrt(3) ) a0^2.

Now, a · (b × c) is the dot product of a with this vector.

a is (a0, 0, 0 ), so the dot product is a0 * 0.25 a0^2 =0.25 a0^3.

So V= |0.25 a0^3 | =0.25 a0^3.

Wait, but the volume of a rhombohedral unit cell is generally a0^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos α + 2 cos^3 α ) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, the cross product calculation may have mistakes. Let me recompute.

Compute b × c:

b = (a0 * sqrt(3)/2, a0 * 0.5, 0 )

c = (a0 * sqrt(3)/2, a0 * 0.232, a0 * 0.5 )

So:

Cross product components:

i: b_y c_z - b_z c_y = (a0 * 0.5)(a0 * 0.5 ) - (0)(a0 * 0.232 )= (0.25 a0² )

j: -(b_x c_z - b_z c_x )= -[ (a0 * sqrt(3)/2)(a0 * 0.5 ) - (0)(a0 * sqrt(3)/2 ) ]= -[ (sqrt(3)/4 a0² ) ] 

k: b_x c_y - b_y c_x = (a0 sqrt(3)/2)(a0 * 0.232) - (a0 * 0.5)(a0 sqrt(3)/2 )

= a0² ( sqrt(3)/2 * 0.232 ) - a0² ( 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 )

= a0² sqrt(3)/2 ( 0.232 - 0.25 )

= a0² sqrt(3)/2 * (-0.018 )

≈ a0² sqrt(3) (-0.009 )

So the cross product vector is:

(0.25 a0², - sqrt(3)/4 a0², -0.009 sqrt(3) a0² )

Then, a · (b × c) = a_x * (b × c)_x + a_y*(b × c)_y + a_z*(b × c)_z.

a is (a0, 0, 0 ), so:

a · (b × c) = a0 * 0.25 a0² + 0 + 0 = 0.25 a0^3.

So volume V= |0.25 a0^3 | =0.25 a0^3.

Now, the area of the (111) plane can be found by the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors lying on the plane. For the (111) plane, two vectors could be (1,1,1) and (1,0,0), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find the area of the parallelogram formed by vectors in the plane, then the area of the unit cell's face, and then find the interplanar distance as height divided by area.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to find the distance between two adjacent planes (111). The formula for the interplanar distance is:

d = (a0^3) / ( V ) * (1/ sqrt( h^2 +k^2 +l^2 + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ ) )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance can be found as:

d = 1 / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ) ) * a0.

Wait, but I'm back to the same formula as before.

Hmm, perhaps I should accept that I can't find a way to get the options provided and look for an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a0 / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) (1 + 2 cos α) )

But for (111), that would be:

d = 10 / sqrt(3*(1 + 2*(sqrt(3)/2 )) )

=10 / sqrt(3*(1 + sqrt(3)) )

=10 / sqrt(3 +3 sqrt(3) )

Compute denominator inside sqrt: 3 +3*1.732=3 +5.196=8.196, same as before. So same result.

Wait, if I compute 10 / sqrt(8.196) =3.49, but options are higher.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses (hkl) as (222) instead of (111), but the question says (111).

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the formula is incorrect, and the interplanar distance is simply a0 multiplied by some factor, but I can't see it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed with a different formula, and the correct option is not present. But since I have to choose from the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1/d = sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2 ) + 2 (hk + hl + kl ) cos α ) / a0.

So 1/d = sqrt(3 +6 cos30 ) /10 = sqrt(8.196)/10 ≈2.863/10=0.2863.

So d=1/0.2863≈3.49. Same as before.

Wait, but the options are way higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the angles given are 30 degrees, but I should have used 60 degrees. Let me try that.

If α=60 degrees, cos60=0.5.

So denominator inside sqrt:3 +6*(0.5)=3+3=6.

sqrt(6)=2.449.

d=10/2.449≈4.082. Still not matching options.

Hmm, perhaps a0 is not 10 Angstrom, but something else. Let me think, perhaps the interatomic distance is related to a0 via another parameter.

Wait, in a simple cubic structure, a0 is the interatomic distance. In a face-centered cubic (FCC), the interatomic distance is a0 * sqrt(2)/2. In a body-centered cubic (BCC), it's a0 * sqrt(3)/2. But in rhombohedral, perhaps the interatomic distance is a0 * something else.

Wait, perhaps for a rhombohedral system with angles 30 degrees, the interatomic distance d is given by d = a0 * sin(30), because the nearest atoms are along the edges. Wait, no, because in a simple cubic, the edge is the interatomic distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is a0 multiplied by cos(30/2), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should take a step back. The calculation I've done gives me d≈3.49, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in applying the formula. But I can't find an alternative formula that gives an option in the 9 Angstrom range.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is d = a0 * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / sqrt( (1 + 2 cosθ) )

Wait, for (111), h² +k² +l²=3.

So denominator: sqrt(1 +2*(0.866))=sqrt(1 +1.732)=sqrt(2.732)=1.652.

So d=10 * sqrt(3)/1.652 → sqrt(3)=1.732 → 1.732 *10=17.32 /1.652≈10.48. Not matching exactly, but option D is 10.05. Close, but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a0 * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) / (sqrt(1 - 3 cosθ + 2 cos^3θ ) )

But that's getting too complicated.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is option C)9.54, but I can't see how to get that.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3 +6 cos30=8.196, but instead of taking the square root, perhaps I should take the cube root or something.

Wait, cube root of 8.196 is about 2.02, so 10/2.02≈4.95, which is still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses (hkl)=222, but the question says (111).

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a0 * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) / ( sqrt( (1 - 3 cosθ ) ) )

So for (111):

sqrt(3) / sqrt(1 - 3 cos30 )

cos30=0.866 →1-3*0.866=1-2.598= -1.598. Negative, so can't take sqrt. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps another approach: Compute the reciprocal of the reciprocal lattice vector.

The reciprocal lattice vector for (111) is (1,1,1) in reciprocal space. The magnitude is sqrt(1^2 +1^2 +1^2 )=sqrt(3).

But in real space, the reciprocal lattice vector is given by (a*, b*, c*), where a* = 1/a.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance is 1/(sqrt(3) a ), which would be 1/(sqrt(3)*10) → ~0.0577, which is way too small. Not matching.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. I think I'll have to go with the initial calculation, even though it doesn't match the options. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct answer is one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the denominator.

Wait, 3 +6 cos30=3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2)=3 +3*sqrt(3).

sqrt(3)=1.732, so 3*1.732=5.196. 3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So 10/2.863=3.49 Angstrom.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a0 * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) / ( sqrt( (1 - cosθ ) ) )

So for (111):

d=10*sqrt(3)/sqrt(1 -0.866)=10*1.732/sqrt(0.134) → sqrt(0.134)=0.366.

So 10*1.732=17.32 → 17.32/0.366≈47.3. No, that's way too high.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C)9.54, which would be approximately 10/sqrt(1.048) → sqrt(1.048)=1.023 → 10/1.023≈9.77. Not matching exactly.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. I've tried multiple approaches and can't get any of the options. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest one is A)9.08, which is about 3.49 *2.6. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the denominator. Wait, 3 +6 cos30 is 8.196. But perhaps I should have used 3 + 6 cos(60), which would be 3+3=6. So sqrt(6)=2.449, d=10/2.449≈4.08, which is closer to option B)8.95, but not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that I made a mistake in the formula and that the correct answer is option C)9.54, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the formula is using (hkl)= (1,1,1), but the reciprocal is different. Let me think of the plane as h=1, k=1, l=1, and the formula is d = a0 * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) / ( sqrt( (1 + 2 cosθ ) ) )

So:

sqrt(3)/sqrt(1 +2*cos30 )= sqrt(3)/sqrt(1+1.732)=sqrt(3)/sqrt(2.732)=1.732/1.652≈1.048.

So d=10 *1.048=10.48 Angstrom, which is close to option D)10.05.

Hmm, not quite matching, but perhaps the approximation leads to option D.

But I'm not confident. Another approach: perhaps the correct formula is d = a0 * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) / ( sqrt( (1 - cosθ ) ) )

Which would be sqrt(3)/sqrt(1-0.866)=sqrt(3)/sqrt(0.134)=1.732/0.366≈4.73, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a0 / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) * (1 - cosθ) )

Which would be 10/(sqrt(3) * (1 -0.866 ))=10/(1.732 * 0.134 )=10/(0.232)=43.1, which is way too high.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but since I have to choose, I'll go with the initial calculation, but since it's not an option, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait a moment. I think I found the mistake. I was using the formula for the interplanar distance in a cubic system, but perhaps the correct formula for rhombohedral is different. I found a reference that says for rhombohedral systems, the interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ )

Which is the same as what I used. So if that's the case, the calculation is correct, and the options are wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses 2 cos α, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a0 / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) (1 + 2 cosθ) )

So for (111), 3*(1 + 2*0.866)=3*(2.732)=8.196. So same as before, leading to d=3.49.

No, same result.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps the intended answer is option C)9.54, based on some miscalculation.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d_{111} \) for a rhombohedral crystal with lattice parameter \( a_0 = 10 \, \text{\AA} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is used:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a_0}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma)}}
\]

For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \). Substituting the values:

\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2(1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ)}}
\]

### Step 1: Simplify the denominator
- \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \)
- The terms inside the square root become:
  \[
  1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3
  \]
  \[
  2(1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ) = 6 \cdot \cos 30^\circ = 6 \cdot 0.866 = 5.196
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total} = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196
  \]

### Step 2: Compute the square root
\[
\sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( d_{111} \)
\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.49 \, \text{\AA}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated value \( d_{111} \approx 3.49 \, \text{\AA} \) does not match any of the provided options, which are all around 9 Angstrom. This discrepancy suggests either an issue with the formula or the interpretation of the problem. However, based on the given options and the closest plausible reasoning, the answer is selected as:
