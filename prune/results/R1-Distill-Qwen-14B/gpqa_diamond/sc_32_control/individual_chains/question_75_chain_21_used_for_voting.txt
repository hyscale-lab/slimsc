Okay, so I've got this question about a genetics experiment gone wrong. Let me try to think through it step by step. So, the setup is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're using a plasmid to overexpress this protein and then purify it to find its binding partners.

They modified the GADD45G gene to add a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. HA tags are usually used for protein detection, right? So they inserted this into a plasmid and transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. But when they checked, the protein wasn't overexpressed as expected. They looked at the construct's sequence and found this long DNA strand.

The question is why they can't express the protein. The options are A to D.

Looking at the plus strand sequence, I notice it's the coding strand because it starts with ATG, which is the start codon. The sequence goes through the gene, including the HA tag. Wait, HA is a peptide from influenza virus, so the tag's DNA sequence should code for the HA epitope.

But the construct isn't working. So possible issues could be in the DNA sequence, which is preventing proper translation or expression.

Option A says the HA sequence has a missense mutation. So, if the HA tag's DNA has a mutation leading to an incorrect amino acid, it might not function as a tag. But wait, the HA tag is for detection, not function. If the HA tag is messed up, maybe the detection antibodies won't work, but the protein should still be made. Unless the mutation is in a critical site. Alternatively, maybe the HA tag is inserted correctly, but perhaps the sequencing shows it's wrong.

Option B suggests the ribosome stops early due to a stop codon. So maybe the sequence has a UAA, UAG, or UGA in frame. Let me look for these in the coding sequence. The coding sequence is the plus strand, so let me scan for those triplets.

Looking through the sequence: TAC is Tyr, then CGA is Arg, etc. Wait, looking for the stop codons. Let's see:

Looking for UAA, UAG, UGA. Since the plus strand is coding, any in-frame TAA, TAG, or TGA on the complementary strand would be stop codons here.

Wait, wait. Wait, the coding strand is the same as the mRNA, except T instead of U. So the coding sequence is the same as mRNA. So in the plus strand, the mRNA would be same as coding strand, so any TAA would be UAA in mRNA, which is a stop.

Looking through the sequence:

I'll scan for TAA, TAG, TGA in the DNA sequence. Let's see:

Looking for "TAA":
- The sequence starts 5' ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA...
Wait, the first part: ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA in triplets. Let me go through the sequence:

Looking at the first part: ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Hmm. Let me look for any TGA, TAG, or TAA.

Looking at around the middle: ...GCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, in the latter part: ...GACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Looking for TGA: Let's see, in the sequence, any 'TGA' triplet? Let's see:

Looking in the middle again. Hmm, I see "TCT" (which is Ser), "GCT" (Ala), "GTC" (Val), etc. Wait, the last part: ...GACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Looking for TGA: So any triplet T-G-A in the sequence? The part just before the end: ...CAGTGA. So the last three nucleotides are TGA. Wait, CAG is Gln, then TGA. So the last three bases are TGA.

Wait, the very end is ...GAGTGA. So the last part is GAG TGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. Oh wait! The coding sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop codon.

So the plus strand ends with TGA. So in the mRNA, which is same as plus strand except T to U, it would be UGA, which is a stop codon. So the gene ends with a stop codon. So the gene is correctly terminated.

But wait, why would that be a problem? Because the HA tag is at the beginning. Let me think, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the stop codon is at the end. So the HA is correctly expressed, but the GADD45G is also expressed, but perhaps the HA is causing a problem.

Wait, no. The problem is that the HA is being added to the N-terminus. So the construct is HA-GADD45G. So the HA tag is at the beginning.

But wait, the stop codon is at the end. So the entire coding sequence for HA and GADD45G is present, and the stop is at the end.

Wait, but if the stop codon is present, the ribosome should terminate correctly. So why isn't the protein being expressed?

Option B says ribosome terminated early. So perhaps there's an in-frame stop codon before the end.

Wait, but the last codon is TGA, which is correct. But maybe there's an earlier one.

Let me check earlier parts of the sequence for any in-frame stop codons.

Looking for TGA, TAG, TAA.

Going through the sequence again:

Starts with ATG (start). Then TAC (Tyr), CCC (Pro), ATA (Ile), CGA (Arg), TGT (Cys), TCC (Ser), AGA (Arg), TTA (Leu), GCG (Ala), CCA (Pro), ATG (start again?), etc.

Wait, right after the initial ATG, which is the start codon, the sequence is TAC, which is Tyr. Then CCC, Pro, etc.

Wait, looking for if any triplet is TAG, TGA, or TAA.

Looking for TAG: Any T-A-G triplet in the sequence? Let's see:

Looking through the sequence:

- The sequence includes ...GCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, looking for TGA or TAG or TAA in triplets. Let's go step by step.

First part:

ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA ... etc.

Wait, the first few codons: ATG (start), TAC (Tyr), CCC (Pro), ATA (Ile), CGA (Arg), TGT (Cys), TCC (Ser), AGA (Arg), TTA (Leu), GCG (Ala), CCA (Pro), ATG (start again? No, that can't be. Wait, that's the coding sequence, which is supposed to be a single ORF. Oh wait, ATG is the start codon, so the next codon is TAC, then CCC, and so on. So the ATG is only once at the beginning.

Looking for any TAG, TGA, or TAA in the codons.

Looking further:

Looking at the part where it says ...TCGTCGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, I see "TGA" in the middle: ...TGAACGTGGAC... So that's TGA, which is a stop codon. So the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop. So that's a problem because it's in the middle of the coding sequence.

Wait, does this TGA come after the HA tag? Because if the coding starts with ATG, and then after HA, this TGA is somewhere in the middle, the ribosome would stop there, resulting in a truncated protein.

Wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus. So the HA coding is before this TGA. So if the TGA is in frame, then the ribosome would terminate early, producing a truncated protein or nothing.

So that's a problem. So the construct has a premature stop codon in the middle of the coding sequence.

So the reason the protein isn't overexpressed is that the ribosome is terminating early because there's a TGA codon in the middle.

Looking back at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. So that would be the reason.

Alternatively, option D says the tRNA for UAA doesn't exist in the mouse. But in this case, the stop codon is UGA (from TGA in DNA), which is recognized by the release factor. All cells have tRNAs for the stop codons, but they don't have tRNAs that match them because they're stop signals. So option D is not correct.

Option C: lack of linker causing proteolysis. The HA tag is a small peptide; maybe the linker between HA and GADD45G is missing, causing the protein to be degraded. But the question doesn't mention anything about a linker being omitted. The problem is the DNA sequence, according to the user, and in this case, the DNA has a premature stop.

Option A: HA has a missense mutation. If the HA's DNA is mutated, it would affect the epitope, but the protein would still be made. However, the problem is that the protein isn't expressed at all, so it's more likely a problem with the coding sequence causing the ribosome to stop.

So the correct answer should be B: the ribosome terminated early because there's a stop codon in the middle.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying why a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein, tagged with an HA determinant at the N-terminus, fails to express the protein. The provided DNA sequence of the plus strand reveals that the coding sequence ends with a premature stop codon, TGA, in the middle of the sequence. This stop codon is in frame and would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early, resulting in a truncated or non-functional protein. 

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A:** A missense mutation in the HA sequence could affect the detection of the tag but would not prevent the protein from being synthesized. The issue here is the lack of protein expression, so this is unlikely to be the cause.
- **Option B:** The presence of a premature stop codon (TGA) in the middle of the coding sequence explains why the ribosome terminates translation early, preventing the full-length protein from being expressed. This aligns with the observed failure to overexpress the protein.
- **Option C:** The lack of a linker sequence could lead to proteolysis, but the question focuses on the DNA sequence, and no evidence of proteolysis is provided. The issue is more likely due to the premature stop codon.
- **Option D:** The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse, but this is irrelevant here because the stop codon in the sequence is TGA, which is universally recognized by release factors.

The most plausible explanation is that the premature stop codon (TGA) in the coding sequence causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing proper expression of the GADD45G protein.

**Answer: B**
