Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic speeds... that means I can't just use classical mechanics; I have to consider special relativity. 

The problem states that the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m and are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question asks for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just subtracting the two velocities. Oh right, because velocities don't add like that when they're a significant fraction of the speed of light. So I remember there's this formula for the relative velocity. Let me think... I think it's (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²), where u and v are the two velocities. Oh wait, but wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's frame, what's B's speed?

Wait, no. Wait, astronaut A is 2m mass moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is 3m moving at 0.5c. So from the perspective of the rest frame (where the problem is probably being considered), what is the relative velocity between them? Or is the question asking for the speed of one relative to the other?

Wait, the question says "relative speed". So if I'm astronaut A, what speed do I measure for astronaut B? Or vice versa? Because in relativity, the relative speed isn't just 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. That's what I thought initially, but I remember that's not correct because of the Lorentz factor.

So the correct formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). Let me plug in the numbers. So u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c.

So (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)) = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) = (0.1c) / 0.7 = approximately 0.142857c. So about 0.14c. Oh wait, looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c. So that's the relative speed.

Now for the total energy. The total energy in relativity is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy is given by gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but wait: each astronaut's energy is their respective gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy. So for astronaut A (2m, 0.6c):

Gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy A is 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut B (3m, 0.5c):

Gamma_B = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.25)) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So approximately 1.1547.

Energy B is 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy E is 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches. Option D says E=5 mc², which is less.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says "the total energy of the system." So in the rest frame, the system's total energy would be the sum of the energies of both astronauts. So yes, as I calculated.

So putting it together, the relative speed is about 0.14c and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C has v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². So that should be the correct choice.

Wait, let me double-check the relative velocity calculation to make sure I didn't mess up the formula. The formula for relative velocity when both are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). So u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c.

(0.6c - 0.5c) = 0.1c. Denominator is (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²) → 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 = (1/7) c ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So yes, that's correct.

So the answers are relative speed 0.14c and energy 5.96 mc². So option C.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system, considering relativistic effects.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) (velocity of the first astronaut) and \( v = 0.5c \) (velocity of the second astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1429c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of the First Astronaut
For the first astronaut with mass \( 2m \) and velocity \( 0.6c \):

\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of the Second Astronaut
For the second astronaut with mass \( 3m \) and velocity \( 0.5c \):

\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
