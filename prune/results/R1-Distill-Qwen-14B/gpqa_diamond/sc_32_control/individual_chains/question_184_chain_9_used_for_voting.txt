Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene, and I need to choose the correct sequence of reactions from the given options. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me try to visualize what that structure looks like.

First, I need to figure out the substituents on the benzene ring. The positions are numbered 1, 2, and 3. So, 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, and 3 is nitro. Let me draw this out mentally. The benzene ring has three substituents: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, their positions are adjacent—like positions 1, 2, and 3 in a row. Wait, or are they meta or para? Wait, 1, 2, 3 positions would be adjacent to each other in a way that they are in a row, but benzene is a ring. So positions 1, 2, and 3 would form a sort of 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene with each substituent adjacent.

But wait, wait, maybe I got the numbering wrong. Let me think again. The IUPAC name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So substituents are in positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So on the benzene ring, these are in positions 1, 2, and 3. So the substituents are adjacent in a sort of order around the ring.

Now, the question is about the synthesis pathway. The starting material is benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence of reactions would lead to the target molecule.

Let me first think about the substituents we're adding. There are three groups: ethoxy (ethoxy group), tert-butyl, and nitro. The order in which we add these substituents matters because of the directing effects of the groups. Electrophilic substitution reactions are influenced by the substituents already present on the ring.

Nitro groups are meta directors, so if we add nitro after another group, it will direct incoming substituents to specific positions. Ethoxy is an activating group (ortho/para director), and tert-butyl is a bulky activating group (also ortho/para, but bulky so tends to direct more to para? Or maybe it's more like para for bulky groups due to steric hindrance).

Wait, tert-butyl is a strong activating group because it's an alkyl group, so it should be an activating (electron donating) group. So, it should direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions relative to itself.

But wait, the nitro group is a deactivating (meta) director. So when introducing nitro groups, they should be added after activating groups because nitro is a strong deactivating group. If you add nitro early, it would deactivate the ring, making subsequent substitutions harder.

So, the strategy should be to add activating groups first, then deactivating ones. So, perhaps we should add tert-butyl and ethoxy first, and then add nitro.

Wait, but ethoxy is a good activating group, and tert-butyl is as well. However, the order in which we add them would determine where the next substituent goes.

Let me think about the positions in the target molecule. The substituents are at 1, 2, and 3. So, let's see: position 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, 3 is nitro. So in the ring, they are in a 1,2,3 arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the benzene ring looks like this:

Positions:
1: ethoxy (OCH2CH2CH3)
2: tert-butyl (C(CH3)3)
3: nitro (NO2)

So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, 3, making a meta arrangement relative to each other but adjacent in the numbering. So, the positions are adjacent in a way that each substituent is next to the others.

Wait, perhaps it's a meta arrangement for some and ortho for others. Hmm, maybe I should think about the directing effects when adding each substituent.

Let me think of the synthesis steps:

1. Adding the first substituent: perhaps tert-butyl or ethoxy.

2. Then adding another substituent, considering the directing effect of the first.

3. Then adding the third substituent.

But wait, the target has three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. So, three steps of electrophilic substitution.

The problem is each substituent's position. Let me think of each substitution step.

First substitution: Let's consider adding the ethoxy group. If I add ethoxy first, the ring is activated, so the next substitution will go ortho or para to ethoxy. But then adding tert-butyl may go ortho or para to ethoxy, but where?

Wait, but the target has ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So if I add ethoxy first at position 1, then the next substituent (tert-butyl) would be added ortho or para to ethoxy. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to add the tert-butyl group first.

Wait, let me consider adding the tert-butyl group first. So, benzene reacts with tert-butyl chloride in presence of AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts alkylation). Then, the ring has a tert-butyl group at position 1 (let's say). Then, the next substituent could be ethoxy. Since the tert-butyl is an activating group, the ethoxy will be introduced ortho or para to it.

Wait, but in the target, the ethoxy is at position 1 and tert-butyl at 2. So, perhaps the ethoxy was added before the tert-butyl? Or vice versa.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the substituents in the order they are added. Let's think about which substituents are added after which.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, substituents at 1, 2, 3. Let me consider each possible order of addition.

Option 1: Add ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

Option 2: Add tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Option 3: Add nitro first (unlikely, since nitro is deactivating and would complicate further substitutions).

Option 4: Maybe nitro is added last, as the last substituent, since it's a deactivating group.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is at position 3. So, when adding nitro, it should be directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, perhaps let me think about the positions. If I have benzene, first add tert-butyl at position 2. Then, add ethoxy, which would be directed ortho or para to the tert-butyl. So, if the tert-butyl is at position 2, then ethoxy could be at position 1 or 3. Then, adding nitro next would have to be directed by the existing substituents.

Alternatively, maybe the first substituent is ethoxy. Then, tert-butyl is added ortho or para to that. Let's say ethoxy is at position 1, then tert-butyl could go to position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). Then, when adding nitro, it would be directed by both substituents.

Wait, but the nitro is at position 3 in the target. So, if I have ethoxy at 1 and tert-butyl at 2, then the next substituent (nitro) should go into a position that's directed by both groups.

But wait, nitro is a meta director. So, let's see. After adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the ring is activated by both groups, but if one substituent is meta and the other is ortho, it can get complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced as a meta director, but it's better to add nitro after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the order. Let's think about the order of adding nitro.

Nitro groups are usually introduced via nitration, which is a strong electrophile. But because nitro is deactivating, it's better to add it when the ring is still activated. So, perhaps nitro is added last, after the two activating groups are in place.

So the order would be: first tert-butyl (using Friedel-Crafts alkylation), then ethoxy (another electrophilic substitution, perhaps via ether synthesis?), and then nitro.

Wait, but adding ethoxy would require a good activating group. If the ring has a tert-butyl group, which is activating, so that's fine.

Wait, but how do you add an ethoxy group via electrophilic substitution? Alternatively, perhaps it's better to do it via a nucleophilic substitution, but more likely, it's an electrophilic substitution.

Wait, adding an ethoxy group via electrophilic substitution requires converting the ethyl group into a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps using a tosylate or something. But I think in practice, the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's usually with strong activating groups, like when the ring is strongly deactivating (like nitro groups), but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds an alkyl group. But Friedel-Crafts acylation adds an acyl group. To add an ethoxy group, perhaps we can perform an etherification. Alternatively, maybe we can form a good leaving group on ethyl chloride and use a directing group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution, but that typically requires a strongly activated ring, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps we can add the ethoxy group via a substitution reaction, but I'm not remembering the exact method. Another approach: perhaps using a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that requires the ring to be activated towards nucleophilic attack, which is usually when the ring has strong electron-withdrawing groups like nitro. Hmm, but in this case, the ring is being activated by substituents like tert-butyl and ethoxy, which are electron-donating.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to think about each step in the reaction sequences provided in the options.

Looking at the options, each has a series of steps. Let me try to parse one option.

Option A:
i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation → benzene gets tert-butyl group → product is tert-butylbenzene.
ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Since tert-butyl is activating, nitration would occur at either ortho or para position. But where? Let's say the nitro group would add either ortho or para to the tert-butyl. Then, step iii is SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation, which is another activating group. Then iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. Wait, but after sulfonation, the ring is more activated, but wait, benzene derivatives with activating groups are more reactive. But I'm not sure where the substituents would add. This seems a bit complicated, but perhaps I should think about each option step by step.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to see which options correctly sequence the introduction of the substituents in the correct order. Let's think about each substituent and their nature.

The target molecule has three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. The ethoxy and tert-butyl are both activating groups, while nitro is a deactivating group.

The order of adding substituents would influence where each group goes. So, perhaps the correct order is to add tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Wait, but let me think about this. If I add tert-butyl first, then the ring is activated. Then, adding ethoxy would go to ortho or para to the tert-butyl. Let's say it goes to the para position. Then, when adding nitro, it would be directed by both substituents.

Alternatively, maybe adding ethoxy first, then tert-butyl. Let's see: after ethoxy is added, the ring is activated. Then, adding tert-butyl would go ortho or para to ethoxy. But I'm not sure if that leads to the correct positions.

Wait, but the target has ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, their positions are 1, 2, 3. So, ethoxy and tert-butyl are in adjacent positions (1 and 2), and nitro is in the next (3), which is adjacent to both. Hmm, but that would mean that the nitro is in a position that's meta to one group and ortho to another.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added in the meta position relative to the ethoxy and ortho to the tert-butyl.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about each reaction step in the options.

Looking at the options, each has a series of steps. Let me try to see which option correctly adds substituents in the right order.

For example, looking at Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene
ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction? Wait, Fe/HCl is a reducing condition. Wait, nitrobenzene can be reduced with Fe and HCl to produce phenylamine. But that would be a different substituent. Hmm, but after nitration, adding Fe/HCl would reduce the nitro group, which doesn't make sense because the target has nitro group. So perhaps Option D is not correct.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride (Friedel-Crafts alkylation) → ring has tert-butyl.
ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. So nitro would add, but where? It could go ortho or para to tert-butyl. Let's say para is position 4. But in the target, nitro is at 3. So perhaps this step isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps the nitro is added in a different position because of the existing substituent.

Alternatively, maybe the order is different. Let's think about how substituents influence each other.

In the target, ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

So, if I have benzene, first add ethoxy. Then, tert-butyl would be added ortho or para to ethoxy.

Let's say ethoxy is at position 1. Adding tert-butyl would go to position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). Let's assume it goes to 2. Then, when adding nitro, which substituent will direct it? The nitro is a strong deactivating group, but when adding it, the existing groups are ethoxy (activating, ortho/para director) and tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para).

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is at position 3. So, maybe the nitro is added in the meta position relative to the tert-butyl.

Wait, but let's think about the positions. Ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2. So, the positions adjacent to both would be 3, 4, 5, 6. Wait, benzene is a ring, so after 6 comes 1 again.

If ethoxy is at 1 and tert-butyl at 2, then the positions are:

1: OCH2CH2CH3 (ethoxy)
2: C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl)
3: ?

If we add nitro next, where would it go? The existing substituents are both activating, so the ring is activated. The nitro group is added during nitration, which is an electrophilic substitution.

The nitro group will be directed by the existing substituents. Let's see: the ethoxy group is at 1, which is an activating group, so nitration would prefer ortho or para to ethoxy. The tert-butyl is at 2, also activating, so nitration would prefer ortho or para to it.

So, possible positions for nitro could be:

- Ortho to ethoxy (positions 2 or 6)
- Para to ethoxy (position 4)
- Ortho to tert-butyl (positions 1 or 3)
- Para to tert-butyl (position 6, which is already occupied by ethoxy if the tert-butyl is at 2?)

Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me try to number the ring again.

Let's imagine the benzene ring with ethoxy at position 1. Then, tert-butyl is at position 2. So, the ring is numbered clockwise:

1: ethoxy
2: tert-butyl
3: (empty)
4: (empty)
5: (empty)
6: (empty)

Now, when adding nitro, the substituents are at 1 and 2. Nitro will be directed by both.

Looking at possible positions:

- Position 3: is it ortho to tert-butyl at 2 (since position 3 is next to 2, which is ortho). So, position 3 is ortho to 2. Also, position 3 is meta to ethoxy at 1 (since 1,3 are two positions apart, so meta).

Wait, but ethoxy is activating (ortho/para director), so nitration would prefer ortho (positions 2 and 6) or para (position 4) to ethoxy. However, position 2 is already occupied by tert-butyl, so the possible ortho positions are 2 (occupied) and 6 (empty). Para to ethoxy is position 4 (since 1 and 4 are opposite).

But tert-butyl is at 2, which is an activating group, so nitration will also prefer ortho (positions 1 and 3) and para (position 5) relative to tert-butyl.

So, when considering both substituents:

Ethoxy directs to 2 (occupied), 6, and 4.
Tert-butyl directs to 1 (occupied by ethoxy), 3, and 5.

So, the available positions that are directed by either substituent are 3,4,5,6.

But where will the nitro group go? It's about the relative directing strengths and the activation of the ring.

In the target, the nitro is at position 3. So, perhaps the nitro is added ortho to the tert-butyl (position 3) and meta to the ethoxy.

So, if the order is: add ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro, then the nitro would go to position 3 as per the directing effects.

So, the steps would be:

1. Add ethoxy group via Friedel-Crafts? But wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation is for alkyl groups; for ethers, perhaps it's done via a different method. Alternatively, maybe it's introduced via a nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps adding ethoxy via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution would require a strongly activated ring. But benzene doesn't undergo that easily. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via an ether-forming reaction, such as using benzene, ethyl chloride, and a Lewis acid like AlCl3, but I'm not sure if that's a standard method.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced as a nitration followed by another step. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the ring is nitrated. Wait, but the nitro group is meta to the ethoxy in the target. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added after nitration, but that would require nitro being present.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to look at the options again.

Looking at option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → benzene gets tert-butyl group → position 2 (say)
ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration → nitro group added, where? Since the ring has tert-butyl (activating), nitro would add ortho or para to it. Let's say para is position 6. But in the target, nitro is at position 3, so perhaps this isn't correct.

Then, step iii: Fe/HCl → this is a reduction condition. Maybe it's used to reduce a nitro group to an amine. But the target has a nitro group, so reducing it doesn't make sense. So maybe option B is incorrect.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride → adds tert-butyl group to benzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Sulfonic acid groups are strong activating, but they are usually meta directors. Wait, but adding a sulfonic acid group would complicate things. Also, in the target, we don't have a sulfonic acid group. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to NH2 → aniline.

iii) tert-butyl chloride → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But aniline is a strong activating group (ortho/para), so the tert-butyl would add there.

Wait, but in the target, the substituents are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. So, after nitration, reduction, and alkylation, perhaps the nitro would be converted to NH2, then tert-butyl added. But I'm not sure if this leads to the correct substituents.

Alternatively, this approach would lead to a nitro group being present as an amine, which isn't desired. So perhaps option D is incorrect.

Option A: Let's look at option A's steps:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → benzene → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. The ring is activated by tert-butyl, so nitration occurs at ortho or para. Let's say para is position 4.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Add a sulfonic acid group. But the target doesn't have this, so perhaps this is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the steps needed.

We need to add ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups in some order. The correct order would be to add the activating groups first, then the deactivating group.

So, the steps would be:

1. Add tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts to benzene. Now, the ring has tert-butyl.

2. Add ethoxy group. Since the ring is activated by tert-butyl, ethoxy can be added via electrophilic substitution, perhaps via a tosylate or another method. Wait, but how do you add an ethoxy group via electrophilic substitution? Because benzene doesn't react with ethyl chloride under normal conditions. Perhaps it's done via forming an ethyl chloride as an electrophile in presence of a Lewis acid.

Alternatively, perhaps it's done via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe using a directing group. Hmm, this part is confusing me.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via an etherification reaction, such as using Williamson synthesis, but that usually requires an alkoxide and an alkyl halide, which might not directly apply here.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a Friedel-Crafts type reaction, but that's typically for alkylation (alkyl groups) and acylation (acyl groups). For ethers, perhaps we'd use something else.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an electrophilic substitution using an ethyl tosylate or similar, but I'm not certain about the exact conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after a nitro group is present, but that would require activating the ring towards nucleophilic attack, which usually requires strong electron-withdrawing groups like nitro.

Wait, but the target has both ethoxy and tert-butyl as activating groups, so maybe the nitro is added last. So, steps would be:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add ethoxy.

3. Add nitro.

But how to add ethoxy? Let me think. Maybe the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution, but that requires the ring to be activated. Since the ring already has a tert-butyl group, which is activating, perhaps that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is added via a coupling reaction, but I'm not familiar with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced as a tosylate, but again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via another electrophilic substitution. For that, perhaps we can generate an ethyl electrophile. For example, using an ethyl chloride with a strong Lewis acid like AlCl3. So, benzene with a tert-butyl group would react with ethyl chloride in presence of AlCl3 to add ethoxy.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation usually adds alkyl groups, not ether groups. So perhaps that's not the method. Alternatively, perhaps using an ethyl bromide with AlCl3 to add the ethoxy group.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing alkylation (which adds -R) with ether formation. Alternatively, perhaps it's done via a different mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via an SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution), which requires a strongly activated ring. But with a tert-butyl group present, maybe it's possible.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on how to introduce the ethoxy group. Let's think about the options again.

Looking at the options, each has a series of steps. Let me see which options include adding an ethoxy group.

Looking at option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → adds tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration → adds nitro.

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction of nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again? That doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps option B doesn't add the ethoxy group, so it's incorrect.

Looking at option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride → add tert-butyl.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation → adds sulfonic acid group. But the target doesn't have that, so this may not be correct.

Option D:

i) nitration → nitro group.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) tert-butyl chloride → alkylation. But aniline is more reactive than benzene, so tert-butyl would add to the amine. But that doesn't align with the target.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) nitration → adds nitro.

iii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → makes diazonium salt.

v) H3O+/H2O/heat → hydrolysis of diazonium salt to phenol? But the target has ethoxy, not phenol.

Hmm, perhaps option A is incorrect.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I should focus on the steps that introduce the ethoxy group. Looking at the options, I notice that some steps involve NaOH and EtBr (ethanol and Br). For example, in option D, step ix is NaOH and EtBr. That sounds like an SN2 reaction, perhaps for introducing an ethoxy group via substitution.

Wait, NaOH and EtBr would generate ethoxide ions, which could perform a nucleophilic substitution if the ring is activated. But for that, the ring needs a good leaving group, which is usually a nitro group. Hmm, but in the target, the nitro is present, so perhaps that's used in a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, but in this case, the target has nitro, so perhaps the substitution is happening elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve introducing a nitro group, then a leaving group, then substituting with ethoxy.

Hmm, maybe I should think about each option's steps again.

Looking at option B:

i) tert-butyl → benzene has tert-butyl.

ii) nitration → adds nitro. Let's say it goes para to tert-butyl, position 4.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine at position 4.

iv) HNO3 again → nitration again. But that doesn't make sense because the ring is now more activated (amine is strongly activating), so nitration would be easy, but I'm not sure why you'd nitrate again.

This seems incorrect.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) SO3 → adds a sulfonic acid group (meta to tert-butyl).

iii) HNO3 → nitrates, perhaps in a position directed by both substituents.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3 again → another nitration. Hmm, not sure.

Option D:

i) nitrate → nitro group.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to amine.

iii) tert-butyl → adds via Friedel-Crafts to the amine. But that's unlikely because amine is a strong activating group, but AlCl3 might not work with aniline.

Alternatively, maybe the steps are adding substituents in a way that generates the correct positions.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add tert-butyl first.

2. Add ethoxy group.

3. Add nitro group last.

But how?

Let me think about option B again.

Option B's steps:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3 → adds nitro.

But then, where would the ethoxy come from? Oh, looking at option B's steps, I don't see any step that introduces an ethoxy group. So option B doesn't include adding ethoxy, so it's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check each option for the presence of steps that add ethoxy.

Looking at the options:

Option A:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3.

iii) SO3.

iv) NaNO2.

v) dilute H2SO4.

vi) H3O+/H2O.

vii) NaOH and EtBr.

viii) Fe/HCl.

ix) HNO3.

So, step vii is NaOH and EtBr. That could be a substitution reaction where a good leaving group is replaced by ethoxy.

Similarly, in option D, step ix is NaOH and EtBr.

So, perhaps in the correct sequence, the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution, which requires a good leaving group, like a nitro group.

Wait, but nitro groups are not good leaving groups. Alternatively, perhaps a nitro group is converted into a better leaving group, like through diazotization and then hydrolysis to form a phenol, which can then undergo substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is replaced by ethoxy via a nucleophilic substitution. Hmm, but nitro is a meta director and would require specific conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve adding a nitro group, then converting it into a leaving group, and then substituting with ethoxy.

Wait, that might be a possibility. Let's think: benzene → nitro group → then convert nitro to a good leaving group → substitute with ethoxy.

But in the target, the nitro group is present, so that approach may not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after adding a nitro group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the nitro group being added last. So, the first two substituents are tert-butyl and ethoxy, then nitro is added.

But how to add ethoxy? Maybe via a substitution after nitration. Let's see.

Wait, but if nitro is present, it's a deactivating group, making the ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. So, adding ethoxy after nitro would be difficult.

Hmm, perhaps the correct order is to add tert-butyl, then nitro, then ethoxy. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the steps in option B again. It doesn't include adding ethoxy, so I can eliminate it.

Looking at option C:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3 → nitrate again?

This seems complicated, and I don't see an ethoxy group being added.

Looking at option D:

i) nitrate → nitro group.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to amine.

iii) add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts. But aniline (if nitro was reduced) is more reactive, so the tert-butyl would add ortho or para to the amine.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → make diazonium.

vi) SO3 → sulfonate.

vii) dilute H2SO4.

viii) H3O+/H2O.

ix) NaOH and EtBr → substitute.

So, perhaps this is a way to substitute a group with ethoxy.

Wait, but in the target, there are three substituents, and I'm not sure this sequence adds all of them correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the order of adding the substituents and the reaction conditions.

If the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, the substituents are in positions 1,2,3.

So, perhaps the nitro is added at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy and ortho to tert-butyl.

Wait, but how to get that arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are added in the order: tert-butyl, nitro, ethoxy.

But for that to happen, the nitro would be added after tert-butyl, directing the ethoxy to a specific position.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about each reaction step in each option.

Option B: Let me look again.

Option B's steps:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3 → nitro.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis to phenol.

vii) NaOH and EtBr → substitution with ethoxy.

viii) SO3 → sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

Hmm, perhaps during step vii, the phenol group is substituted with ethoxy. But the target doesn't have a sulfonate group, so option B's step viii adds that, which is incorrect.

So, perhaps the correct option is none of these. Wait, no, the options must have the correct one.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add nitro via nitration, which goes ortho to tert-butyl (position 2+1=3? Not sure).

3. Then, add ethoxy via substitution.

Wait, but without a leaving group, how? Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced, then converted into a leaving group, and then substituted with ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after the nitro group is present.

But in that case, the order would be: tert-butyl, nitro, ethoxy.

But let me think about the directing effects.

If I have benzene with a tert-butyl group in position 2, and a nitro group in position 3 (meta to tert-butyl), then adding ethoxy would be directed by both groups.

Wait, but the nitro is a deactivating group, so it would deactivate the ring in its vicinity. So, the ethoxy would likely go ortho or para to the tert-butyl, but how?

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is added via a substitution reaction, replacing a nitro group that's been converted into a better leaving group. But that seems a bit involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

Wait, adding ethoxy first: benzene + ethoxy via some method → ethoxybenzene.

Then, add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Since ethoxy is an activating group, the tert-butyl would add ortho or para to ethoxy.

If ethoxy is at position 1, the tert-butyl could be at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para).

Then, add nitro via nitration. The nitro would be directed by both ethoxy and tert-butyl.

If ethoxy is at 1 and tert-butyl at 2, then the nitro would go to position 3 (meta to ethoxy and ortho to tert-butyl).

That would give the desired structure.

So, the steps would be:

1. Add ethoxy to benzene.

2. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

3. Add nitro via nitration.

But how to add ethoxy to benzene via electrophilic substitution?

Ah, perhaps through a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that’s usually only feasible with a strongly activated ring, like with a nitro group present. But ethoxy is an activating group, so in the first step, if I don't have any deactivating groups, maybe it's not possible.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. I think I'm stuck. But perhaps I should look for an option that adds tert-butyl first, then nitro, then ethoxy via substitution.

Looking at option B again, step vii is NaOH and EtBr, which would allow substitution. So, perhaps after adding nitro and other groups, the ethoxy is introduced via substitution.

Wait, perhaps in option B, the steps are:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) nitration adds nitro, perhaps at position 4 (para to tert-butyl).

iii) Fe/HCl reduces nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again → perhaps adds another nitro group, but that's not in the target.

Hmm, perhaps option B isn't correct.

Alternatively, maybe the correct order is: add ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

But I'm not seeing an option that does that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the sequence of steps leading to the target molecule.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So, substituents are at 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro).

Let me imagine the order of adding these substituents as:

1. Add ethoxy to benzene → ethoxybenzene.

2. Add tert-butyl → ortho or para to ethoxy.

Assuming it's para, but not sure.

Wait, but the target has tert-butyl at 2 and ethoxy at 1, which are adjacent. So, perhaps the tert-butyl is added ortho to ethoxy.

So, ethoxy is added first, then tert-butyl is added ortho to it.

Then, nitro is added meta to ethoxy and ortho to tert-butyl.

So, the steps are:

1. Add ethoxy → via electrophilic substitution. How?

Perhaps using a method like the Wurtz reaction, but that’s for coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps using an ethyl halide with a Lewis acid. But I'm not sure.

Assuming it's possible to add ethoxy first, the next step is to add tert-butyl ortho to ethoxy.

Then, nitration would add nitro at position 3.

So, the order of reactions would be: ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

Now, looking at the options, which option follows this sequence?

Option B's steps: tert-butyl, nitro, reduction, nitro again, etc. No, that doesn't fit.

Option D: nitro, reduction, tert-butyl, etc. Doesn't fit.

Option A: tert-butyl, nitro, sulfonate, etc. No.

Option C: tert-butyl, sulfonate, nitro, etc. No.

Hmm, perhaps none of the options directly follow this order, but looking more carefully.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve adding the tert-butyl first, then nitro, then ethoxy via substitution.

Looking at option B, after adding tert-butyl and nitro, steps iii and iv involve Fe/HCl (reduction), then another nitration. Doesn't fit.

Looking at option D, after nitration and reduction, adds tert-butyl, then another nitration. Doesn't fit.

Looking at option C, after adding tert-butyl and sulfonate, then nitro. Doesn't seem to fit.

Looking at option A: after adding tert-butyl and nitro, then sulfonate, and then various steps, including H3O+ and heat. Could this lead to substitution?

Wait, in option A, step vii is NaOH and EtBr. So, perhaps it's an SN2 substitution, where a leaving group is replaced by ethoxy.

So, perhaps the nitro group is converted into a leaving group, then substituted with ethoxy.

Wait, but nitro groups aren't good leaving groups. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is converted into a diazonium salt, which can be hydrolyzed to a phenol, which can then undergo substitution.

So, perhaps the steps in option A are:

i) add tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate → nitro added.

iii) sulfonate → adds sulfonic acid group, which is a strong activating group.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → form diazonium salt from nitro group.

v) H3O+ and heat → hydrolyze to phenol.

vi) NaOH and EtBr → substitute phenol with ethoxy.

But wait, the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so option A's step ii introduces it, which would mean the target has four substituents, which it doesn't. So, option A is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again about the correct order.

The correct order should be:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add ethoxy.

3. Add nitro.

But how? Because adding ethoxy via electrophilic substitution is tricky without a directing group.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added last, directed by the ethoxy and tert-butyl substituents.

So, the steps would be:

i) add tert-butyl → position 2.

ii) add ethoxy → position 1.

iii) add nitro → position 3.

But how to add ethoxy? Maybe via a nucleophilic substitution, but that requires a good leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, let me think about the steps in option B again.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate → nitro added.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again → another nitro group? Doesn't fit target.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think that option B is correct, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to add the nitro first, but that would deactivate the ring, making further substitutions difficult.

Wait, another angle: the target has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let's count the number of steps each option has.

Looking at option B:

i) Add tert-butyl (1 step).

ii) Nitrate (2).

iii) Reduce (3).

iv) Nitrate again (4).

v) NaNO2 (5).

vi) H3O+ (6).

vii) NaOH and EtBr (7).

viii) SO3 (8).

ix) H2SO4 (9).

That's nine steps, which seems excessive.

Alternatively, option D:

i) Nitrate.

ii) Reduce.

iii) Add tert-butyl.

iv) Nitrate again.

v) NaNO2.

vi) SO3.

vii) H2SO4.

viii) H3O+.

ix) NaOH and EtBr.

Hmm, also multiple steps.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B. But I'm really not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B. But I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the nitro group being added in the correct position.

If the nitro is added after ethoxy and tert-butyl, it would be directed by both groups. So, the nitro would go to position 3.

But how to add ethoxy. Maybe via a substitution.

Wait, perhaps the steps in option B are:

i) Add tert-butyl.

ii) Nitrate → nitro at position 4 (para to tert-butyl).

iii) Reduce nitro to amine.

iv) Nitrate again → another nitro group, but that doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm not certain.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should go with option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. The analysis focuses on the order of adding these substituents and the directing effects of the groups during electrophilic substitution.

### Key Considerations:
1. **Substituent Effects**:
   - **tert-butyl**: Activating, ortho/para-directing.
   - **ethoxy**: Activating, ortho/para-directing.
   - **nitro**: Deactivating, meta-directing.
2. **Order of Addition**:
   - Activating groups (tert-butyl and ethoxy) should be added before the deactivating nitro group to maintain ring reactivity.
   - The nitro group must be added last to avoid deactivating the ring prematurely.

### Analysis of Options:
#### **Option A**:
1. **Steps**:
   - i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → Adds tert-butyl to benzene.
   - ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrates the ring. Nitro could add ortho or para to tert-butyl.
   - iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ → Sulfonates the ring. Introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is not part of the target molecule.
   - Subsequent steps involve reduction, diazotization, and substitution, but the sulfonic acid group makes this sequence incorrect for the target.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Steps**:
   - i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → Adds tert-butyl to benzene.
   - ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrates the ring. Nitro could add ortho or para to tert-butyl.
   - iii) Fe/HCl → Reduces the nitro group to an amine.
   - iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrates again. This step is unnecessary and inconsistent with the target.
   - This sequence does not align with the target molecule and is therefore incorrect.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Steps**:
   - i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → Adds tert-butyl to benzene.
   - ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ → Sulfonates the ring. Introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is not part of the target molecule.
   - iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrates the ring. The sulfonic acid group complicates the directing effects.
   - Subsequent steps involve reduction, diazotization, and substitution, but the sulfonic acid group makes this sequence incorrect for the target.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Steps**:
   - i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrates benzene to form nitrobenzene.
   - ii) Fe/HCl → Reduces the nitro group to an amine.
   - iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → Adds tert-butyl to the amine. However, aniline is strongly activating, and the tert-butyl group would likely add ortho or para to the amine, not in the correct position for the target.
   - Subsequent steps involve further nitration, diazotization, and substitution, but the initial nitration disrupts the desired order of substitution.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence must involve adding tert-butyl and ethoxy first, followed by nitro. However, none of the options perfectly align with this order. Among the given options, **Option B** comes closest, as it includes the addition of tert-butyl and nitro, but the inclusion of reduction and re-nitration steps makes it inconsistent with the target molecule.

Answer: B
