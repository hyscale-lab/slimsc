Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with buffer solutions and all that. But let me take it step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with 200.00 cm³ (so that's 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. We're supposed to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, HPO4^2-.

Hmm, I remember that KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, and Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate. Wait, but wait—no, Na2HPO4 is disodium hydrogen phosphate, right? So when you dissolve them, they dissociate into ions.

KH2PO4 would dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. And Na2HPO4 would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. Oh wait, but the Na2HPO4 is in the dihydrate form, so maybe the formula has two water molecules attached, but when it dissolves, those waters would just go into solution, so the main ions are Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So, putting both of these salts into solution, they'll contribute H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Since H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, it can donate three protons, but in solution, these salts will form a buffer. I think they're in adjacent forms, so maybe they'll buffer around the pKa2 or something like that.

Wait, the problem gives the Ka values: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So, H3PO4 is a weak acid, and loses protons stepwise. The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (with Ka1). The second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2), and the third HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3).

So, the solution contains H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4). That makes sense because the two salts are adjacent in the dissociation series. So this solution is a buffer solution between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

I remember that for buffer solutions, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is useful. The equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The acid is the protonated form, and the base is the deprotonated form. So H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, so H2PO4^- is the acid, and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base.

So, the Henderson equation would be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But wait, the problem isn't asking for pH, it's asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which are HPO4^2-. Oh wait, no. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but I think in this context, the question refers to HPO4^2- as orthophosphate? Or maybe not. Wait, HPO4^2- is the hydrogen phosphate ion. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but perhaps in this case, the question refers to the phosphate ions, which would include HPO4^2- as well as other species.

Wait, the question says "concentration of orthophosphate ions." Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but when it dissociates, it becomes H2PO4^- and so on. Hmm, maybe the question is referring to all the phosphate species, but I think more likely, they're asking about the HPO4^2- concentration because that's one of the species present.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says "orthophosphate ions," which is HPO4^2-? Or is that the hydrogen phosphate. Alternatively, perhaps the term is being used to refer to PO4^3- and HPO4^2-, but I'm a bit confused. But looking back, the problem explicitly says "orthophosphate ions." I think orthophosphate is H3PO4, but that's the neutral molecule. So in solution, it's dissociated into ions. But the solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, so the phosphate species present are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- ions. But maybe I should focus on the buffer first.

So, the molar amounts of each salt will determine the concentrations of the acid and base in the Henderson equation.

First, I need to calculate the moles of each salt.

Molar mass (Mw) of KH2PO4 is given as 136.09 g/mol. So moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007354 mol. Since each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^- ions, the concentration in solution is [H2PO4^-] = 0.007354 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03677 M.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O has a Mw of 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005613 mol. Each mole of Na2HPO4 gives one mole of HPO4^2- ions. So [HPO4^2-] = 0.005613 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02807 M.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O. So when it dissolves, each mole gives one mole of HPO4^2- (because Na2HPO4 dissociates into 2Na+ and HPO4^2-). So yes, each mole of the salt gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So now, the Henderson equation would be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate. I'm getting a bit confused about what exactly is being asked. Oh wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's mostly dissociated. However, in the presence of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, perhaps the concentration of HPO4^2- is part of what contributes to the orthophosphate ion concentration. Alternatively, maybe the problem is looking for the sum of all phosphate species, but I'm not sure. But looking at the options, the numbers are all in the 1e-7 M range, which is much lower than the concentrations I've calculated for H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- (which are about 0.036 M and 0.028 M). Hmm, that doesn't add up. Wait, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I've made a mistake here. Let me double-check. Wait, wait, the solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. But when they dissolve, the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. So the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base), with Ka2 being the relevant pKa.

Wait, wait, but the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- and H3PO4, but perhaps in this case, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so maybe the question is looking for the concentration of HPO4^2-.

But if I'm using the Henderson equation, I can calculate the pH, but the question isn't asking for pH. Oh wait, but maybe the concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the ratio of the two salts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the phosphate ions, which would be the sum of all phosphate species, but that's not what the question says. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the question is about the concentration of HPO4^2- ions, which we can call [HPO4^2-].

Wait, but given that the solution is a buffer, perhaps the concentration of HPO4^2- can be determined via the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, but how?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, perhaps the dominant ion is HPO4^2- because the solution is buffered around pKa2, but that's not the case.

Wait, no. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, which is a weak acid. But in solution, it dissociates into H2PO4^- and H+. However, in the presence of other phosphate species, perhaps the solution's pH affects the concentration of H3PO4.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the total concentration of phosphate ions in the solution, which would be the sum of [H2PO4^-], [HPO4^2-], and [PO4^3-], but that's probably not the case given the options.

Wait, but the options are all around 1e-7 M, which is much lower than the concentrations I calculated earlier for H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- (about 0.036 M and 0.028 M). So maybe I'm missing something here. Perhaps the problem is not about the concentration in solution but about the orthophosphate ion in another form.

Wait, another thought: perhaps in the solution, the phosphate ions are in equilibrium, and the orthophosphate (H3PO4) is in very low concentration because it's a weak acid. So maybe the question is not about HPO4^2- but about H3PO4, but that seems unlikely given the context.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions, which would be the result of the third dissociation. But the third Ka is 1.8e-12, which is very small, so [PO4^3-] would be negligible.

Wait, but I'm getting more confused. Let me think again. The problem gives the volume as 200 cm³ (0.2 L) and two masses. So I calculated the moles correctly. So perhaps the question is about the concentration of HPO4^2-, which is 0.02807 M, but that's way higher than the options given. So that can't be right. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles. Let me recalculate.

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = approximately 1 / 136.09 = 0.007354 mol.

Volume is 0.2 L, so concentration is 0.007354 / 0.2 = 0.03677 M. Which is 3.677e-2 M.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = approx 0.005613 mol.

Concentration: 0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.02806 M.

Hmm, so both of these concentrations are around 0.03 M and 0.028 M, but the options are 1e-7 M, which is way off. So perhaps I misunderstood the problem.

Wait, I think I'm getting this all wrong. Maybe the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which are HPO4^2-, but under certain conditions, perhaps it's considering the activity or the equilibrium.

Wait, but the Henderson equation gives the pH, but perhaps the concentration of HPO4^2- can be determined by the ratio of the two concentrations.

Wait, wait. The Henderson equation is pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But without the pH, how do I find [HPO4^2-]? Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of the two concentrations and then compute the exact concentration based on that.

Wait, the problem is that I have [H2PO4^-] and [HPO4^2-], so I can compute the pH. But the question isn't about pH, it's about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I thought is [HPO4^2-], but that doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the orthophosphate ion refers to H3PO4, which is the uncharged molecule. But how much of that is in solution?

Wait, in the solution, we have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, so the dominant species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but H3PO4 may be present as well, but in what concentration?

But given that the solution is at 25°C, and the pH is determined by the buffer, we can find the pH, and then find the concentration of H3PO4 using the first dissociation.

Wait, that's a possibility. Let me think: H3PO4 can dissociate into H+ and H2PO4^-.

If I know the pH of the solution, I can calculate the concentration of H3PO4.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Calculate the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution.

2. Use the Henderson equation to find the pH.

3. Then, using the first dissociation of H3PO4, calculate the concentration of H3PO4, which is the orthophosphate ion.

Hmm, that makes sense. Let's proceed.

Step 1: I already did this. [H2PO4^-] = 0.03677 M, [HPO4^2-] = 0.02807 M.

Step 2: Using Henderson equation, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) = around 7.207 (since 1e-7 is pH7, 6.2e-8 is about 1e-7.2, so pKa2 is approximately 7.207).

Wait, wait no. Wait, pKa is the negative log of Ka. So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207.

Then, [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02807 / 0.03677 ≈ 0.7636.

So log(0.7636) is approximately -0.116.

So pH = 7.207 - 0.116 ≈ 7.091.

So pH is about 7.09.

Step 3: Now, we can find [H3PO4].

The first dissociation of H3PO4 is H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^-.

The Ka1 is 7.5e-3, so pKa1 = 2.12 (since log(7.5e-3) ≈ 2.12).

At pH 7.09, which is much higher than pKa1, so the solution is in the region where H3PO4 is mostly deprotonated to H2PO4^- and beyond.

The concentration of H3PO4 can be found using the first dissociation. The expression is Ka1 = [H+][H2PO4^-] / [H3PO4].

We can rearrange this to solve for [H3PO4] = [H+][H2PO4^-] / Ka1.

We know [H2PO4^-] is 0.03677 M, and [H+] is 10^-pH ≈ 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

So plugging in:

[H3PO4] = (8.23e-8) * (0.03677) / (7.5e-3).

Let me compute that:

8.23e-8 * 0.03677 = approx 3.03e-9.

Then divide by 7.5e-3: 3.03e-9 / 7.5e-3 = approx 4.04e-7 M.

Wait, but wait, [H2PO4^-] comes from both the initial KH2PO4 and the dissociation of H3PO4. Hmm, but perhaps at this pH, the contribution from H3PO4 dissociation is negligible compared to the initial concentration from KH2PO4. So I can approximate [H2PO4^-] as 0.03677 M.

So [H3PO4] ≈ (8.23e-8) * 0.03677 / 7.5e-3 ≈ (3.03e-9) / 7.5e-3 ≈ 4.04e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option D is 3.97e-7, which is close. Option B is 5.48e-7, but that's higher. Option A is 6.24e-7, which is higher. Option C is 2.81e-7, which is lower.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a calculation mistake. Let me compute the numbers more accurately.

First, compute [H+]: pH = 7.091 → [H+] = 10^-7.091.

Let me compute 10^-7.091.

10^-7 = 1e-7.

10^0.091 ≈ 1.23.

So 10^-7.091 = 1e-7 / 1.23 ≈ 8.13e-8.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 10^0.091 is approximately 1.23, so 10^7.091 is 1e7 * 1.23 = 1.23e7, so 10^-7.091 is 1 / (1.23e7) ≈ 8.13e-8.

So [H+] = 8.13e-8 M.

Now, [H2PO4^-] is 0.03677 M.

So [H3PO4] = (8.13e-8) * 0.03677 / 7.5e-3.

Compute numerator: 8.13e-8 * 0.03677 = ?

8.13e-8 * 0.03677 ≈ (8.13 * 0.03677) * 1e-8.

8.13 * 0.03677 ≈ 0.2987.

So 0.2987e-8 = 2.987e-9.

Divide by 7.5e-3: 2.987e-9 / 7.5e-3 = (2.987 / 7.5) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.3983 * 1e-6 = 3.983e-7 M.

Which is approximately 3.98e-7 M.

Looking at the options, D is 3.97e-7 M. That's very close.

So the answer should be D.

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (H₃PO₄) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄) and HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄), which are adjacent species in the dissociation series of H₃PO₄. The relevant equilibrium is governed by the second dissociation constant, \( K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \), and the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is applied to find the pH of the buffer.

### Step 1: Calculate moles and concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
1. **Moles of KH₂PO₄**:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of KH₂PO₄} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007354 \, \text{mol}
   \]  
   Since each mole of KH₂PO₄ dissociates into one mole of H₂PO₄⁻, the concentration is:  
   \[
   [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{0.007354 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.03677 \, \text{M}.
   \]

2. **Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005613 \, \text{mol}
   \]  
   Each mole of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissociates into one mole of HPO₄²⁻, so the concentration is:  
   \[
   [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{0.005613 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.02807 \, \text{M}.
   \]

### Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to calculate pH
The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right).
\]  
Given \( K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \), we calculate:  
\[
\text{p}K_a2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207.
\]  
The ratio of concentrations is:  
\[
\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} = \frac{0.02807}{0.03677} \approx 0.7636.
\]  
Thus:  
\[
\log(0.7636) \approx -0.116.
\]  
Substituting into the equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 - 0.116 \approx 7.091.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the concentration of H₃PO₄
The first dissociation of H₃PO₄ is:  
\[
\text{H₃PO₄} \leftrightarrow \text{H⁺} + \text{H₂PO₄⁻}.
\]  
The equilibrium expression is:  
\[
K_a1 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}{[\text{H₃PO₄}]}.
\]  
Rearranging for \([\text{H₃PO₄}]\):  
\[
[\text{H₃PO₄}] = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}{K_a1}.
\]  
From the pH, \([\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.091} \approx 8.13 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\). Substituting:  
\[
[\text{H₃PO₄}] = \frac{(8.13 \times 10^{-8})(0.03677)}{7.5 \times 10^{-3}}.
\]  
First, calculate the numerator:  
\[
(8.13 \times 10^{-8})(0.03677) \approx 2.987 \times 10^{-9}.
\]  
Then divide by \( 7.5 \times 10^{-3} \):  
\[
[\text{H₃PO₄}] = \frac{2.987 \times 10^{-9}}{7.5 \times 10^{-3}} \approx 3.98 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Final Answer
The concentration of orthophosphate ions (H₃PO₄) in the solution is approximately \( 3.98 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option **D**.  
**Answer: D**
