Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? So I need to calculate how much of that is in the solution after mixing these two compounds.

The solution volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters because 1 liter is 1000 cm³. So that's 0.2 L. The solution contains 1.00 grams each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. I remember that KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate with some water of crystallization. 

The molecular weights (Mw) are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. I think I need to find the moles of each of these compounds first. 

So for KH2PO4, moles would be mass divided by Mw. So 1.00 g divided by 136.09 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 1 / 136.09 is approximately 0.007337 mol. Similarly for Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. 1 / 177.99 is roughly 0.005606 mol.

Wait, but these are salts of phosphoric acid. Phosphoric acid is H3PO4, which is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons. So the species in solution would depend on the pH, which is determined by the buffer system here.

KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- (the dihydrogen phosphate ion), and Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (the hydrogen phosphate ion). So in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But wait, the question is about orthophosphate ions, which are PO4^3-. So I need to find the concentration of PO4^3- in this solution. Hmm, but how?

Orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form of phosphoric acid. But in solution, I think H3PO4 can lose protons stepwise. So the species present are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. Because the solution is a buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, perhaps some of it will hydrolyze to form PO4^3-.

I think I need to consider the hydrolysis reactions. Let me recall, for each step:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So each subsequent deprotonation is much less likely because the Ka values get smaller. Since the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, it's a buffer system. But the presence of these two will affect the pH, which in turn affects the hydrolysis of HPO4^2- to PO4^3-.

Wait, so the HPO4^2- can further deprotonate to form PO4^3- according to the third dissociation. So the concentration of PO4^3- will depend on the pH of the solution.

But how do I find the pH first? Well, the solution is made by mixing equal moles (if that's the case) of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. Wait, let me check the moles.

Wait, no. Let's compute the moles again. 

KH2PO4 (Mw 136.09) is K+ and H2PO4^-.
So 1g / 136.09 g/mol = approximately 0.007337 mol H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O (Mw 177.99) is 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus 2 H2O. So 1g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005606 mol HPO4^2-.

Wait, so the solution contains 0.007337 mol of H2PO4^- and 0.005606 mol of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the solution is made by mixing these two, so the total volume is 0.2 L.

So the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007337 mol / 0.2 L = 0.036685 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005606 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02803 M.

Wait, so these are the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution. Since the solution is a buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

In this case, the buffer is between H2PO4^- (HA) and HPO4^2- (A^-). So the relevant pKa is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.209.

So pH = 7.209 + log( [HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-] )

Plugging the concentrations in:

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02803 M, [H2PO4^-] = 0.036685 M.

So 0.02803 / 0.036685 ≈ 0.764.

Log(0.764) is approximately -0.115.

So pH = 7.209 - 0.115 = 7.094.

Hmm, around 7.09. Okay, so pH is about 7.1.

Now, knowing the pH, I can find the concentration of PO4^3-.

PO4^3- comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8e-12. Since pH is 7.09, the concentration of H+ is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.09) ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

The expression for Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.

We can rearrange this to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02803 M.

[H+] is 8.23e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02803) / (8.23e-8).

Let me compute numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.02803 ≈ 5.0454e-14.

Divide by 8.23e-8: 5.0454e-14 / 8.23e-8 = approximately 6.128e-7 M.

Wait, so PO4^3- concentration is about 6.13e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, option D is 3.97e-7. Hmm, wait, my calculation got around 6.13e-7, which is closer to option A.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me double-check.

First, calculating moles:

KH2PO4: 1g / 136.09 g/mol.

Let me compute that accurately: 1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007337 mol. Correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1g / 177.99 ≈ 0.005606 mol. Correct.

Concentrations in 0.2 L: 0.036685 M and 0.02803 M, respectively. Correct.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) → pKa = 7.209.

Ratio [A-]/[HA] = 0.02803 / 0.036685 ≈ 0.764. Log(0.764) is about -0.115, so pH=7.094. Correct.

Then, Ka3=1.8e-12.

[H+]=1e-7.09≈8.23e-8. Correct.

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02803) / (8.23e-8) → let me compute that again.

1.8e-12 * 0.02803 = 5.0454e-14.

5.0454e-14 / 8.23e-8 ≈ 6.128e-7. 

So approximately 6.13e-7 M. The closest option is A) 6.24e-7, but wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculations.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the ratio more accurately. Let me redo the Henderson-Hasselbalch part.

Calculate [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02803 / 0.036685.

0.02803 divided by 0.036685:

0.02803 / 0.036685 ≈ 0.764.

Log(0.764) = log(7.64e-1) → log(7.64) is about 0.8838, so log(0.764)=0.8838 -1 = -0.1162.

So pH=7.209 - 0.1162=7.0928.

[H+] is 10^(-7.0928)= ?

Let me compute that.

10^(-7.0928) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0928).

10^(-0.0928) ≈ 0.821.

So [H+]=8.21e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02803) / (8.21e-8) = (5.0454e-14) / (8.21e-8) ≈ 6.145e-7 M.

Hmm, perhaps more precise calculation. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so it's the second dissociation, but perhaps the pH is determined by that buffer.

Wait, but the presence of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- is in a buffer, so their ratio affects the pH, and that pH then affects the third dissociation to form PO4^3-.

Wait, perhaps I can model this with the third dissociation.

The reaction is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-; Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

The H+ concentration is determined by the pH we found earlier, which is 7.09, so [H+]=1e-7.09 ≈8.23e-8.

So, let's plug into the expression.

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange to find [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]

Plugging numbers:

Ka3=1.8e-12

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02803 M.

[H+]=8.23e-8.

So:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02803) / 8.23e-8.

Calculating numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02803 = 5.0454e-14.

Divide by 8.23e-8: 5.0454e-14 / 8.23e-8 = (5.0454 / 8.23) ) * 1e-6.

5.0454 / 8.23 ≈ 0.6128. So 0.6128e-6 → 6.128e-7 M.

So approximately 6.13e-7 M. The options given are:

A) 6.24e-7

B)5.48e-7 

C)2.81e-7 

D)3.97e-7 

So the closest is A.

But wait, why isn't there an option for 6.13e-7? Option A is 6.24e-7. Maybe I did a miscalculation in the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] more accurately.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005606 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02803 M.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007337 mol / 0.2 L = 0.036685 M.

0.02803 / 0.036685 = ?

Let me compute that accurately.

0.02803 / 0.036685 = 0.764 approximately.

But let me compute it as 2803 / 3668.5.

2803 ÷ 3668.5 = ?

Let me do this division: 3668.5 × 0.764 = ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 2803 / 3668.5.

Wait, 3668.5 × 0.764 = 3668 * 0.764 ≈ 2800.

So 2803 / 3668.5 ≈ 0.764.

So, log(0.764) ≈ -0.115.

So pH=7.209-0.115=7.094.

Wait, perhaps more precise calculation of log(0.764).

Log(0.764) = log(7.64 × 10^-1) = log(7.64) + log(10^-1) = 0.8838 -1 = -0.1162.

So pH=7.209 - 0.1162=7.0928.

So [H+]=10^(-7.0928)= ?

Compute 10^(-7.0928):

We can write this as 10^(-7) × 10^(-0.0928).

10^(-7)=1e-7=0.0000001.

10^(-0.0928)= about 0.821.

So [H+]=8.21e-8 M.

Then, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02803) / 8.21e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02803 = 1.8 *0.02803 = 0.050454 → 5.0454e-14.

Divide by 8.21e-8 → 5.0454e-14 /8.21e-8 = (5.0454 /8.21) )e-6.

5.0454 ÷8.21 ≈ 0.6143.

So 0.6143e-6 → 6.143e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 6.14e-7 M.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A) 6.24e-7, which is a bit higher. Maybe I need to calculate more precisely.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value of ([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005606 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02803 M.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007337 mol / 0.2 L = 0.036685 M.

Ratio = 0.02803 / 0.036685 = 0.764 approximately.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute exactly:

0.02803 / 0.036685 = (2803/36685) = 2803 ÷36685.

Hmm, let me compute that.

36685 = 3.6685e4.

2803 /36685 = 2803 ÷36685.

Let me compute 2803 ÷36685:

36685 × 0.0764 = 36685 × 0.07 = 2568, 36685 ×0.006=220, 36685×0.0004=14.674. So 2568+220=2788, +14.674=2802.674. So 36685 ×0.0764 ≈ 2802.674 which is very close to 2803. So the ratio is approximately 0.0764.

Wait, wait, no. 0.0764 ×36685=2803. So 0.0764 is the ratio.

Wait, wait, no. 0.0764 ×36685 is 2803. So the ratio is 0.0764. Because 0.0764 ×36685 = 2803.

Wait, no: 36685 × 0.0764 = 36685 * 764e-4 = 36685 * 764 / 10000.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me instead compute 2803 ÷36685 = ?

I can write this as (2803 × 10000) ÷ (36685 × 10000) = 28,030,000 ÷ 366,850,000.

Hmm, that's not helpful. Alternatively, using a calculator approach:

Compute 2803 ÷36685.

36685 × 0.07 = 2568. So 2803 -2568=235 left.

Now, 36685 ×0.006 = 220.11.

So 0.07 + 0.006 is 0.076, which gives 2568 +220.11=2788.11.

Leftover: 2803 -2788.11=14.89.

Now, 14.89 ÷36685 = approx 0.000405.

So total is 0.076 +0.000405=0.076405.

So the ratio is approximately 0.0764.

Wait, wait, no: wait, the ratio is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02803 / 0.036685 = 0.764.

Wait, wait, I think I have a miscalculation here. Because 0.02803 ÷0.036685 is 0.764. Because 0.02803 is approximately 0.764 times 0.036685.

Because 0.036685 ×0.764 ≈0.02803.

So the ratio is 0.764, not 0.0764. So the previous calculations were correct.

So the pH is 7.09, [H+]=8.23e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02803)/8.23e-8= 5.0454e-14 /8.23e-8= approx 6.13e-7 M.

But the options don't have exactly that. Option A is 6.24e-7. Maybe I should check if I used the correct Ka3 value. The problem states Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which I used.

Another possibility: perhaps I should consider that the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is determined by their ratio, but when they're mixed, the solution's pH affects the third dissociation. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the exact expression for all species, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is determined by their ratio, and then that pH affects the formation of PO4^3-.

Wait, but perhaps I can use the expression for the third dissociation:

[HPO4^2-] = [H+][PO4^3-] + [H2PO4^-]

No, wait, the correct expression is from the third dissociation:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Which is what I did earlier.

So I think the calculation is correct, and the concentration is approximately 6.13e-7 M, which is closest to option A, 6.24e-7, but perhaps I'm missing some precise step.

Wait another thought: maybe I should calculate the exact pH using more precise values.

pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) → exact value.

6.2e-8 is 6.2 ×10^-8. Log(6.2)=0.7924, so pKa2=7.209.

Ratio is 0.02803 / 0.036685=0.764.

Log(0.764) is approximately -0.115.

So pH=7.209-0.115=7.094.

Compute [H+] =10^(-7.094)= approx 8.23e-8.

Then, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02803) / 8.23e-8.

Computing that precisely:

1.8e-12 *0.02803=5.0454e-14.

5.0454e-14 /8.23e-8 = 6.128e-7.

So 6.128e-7 M.

Looking at the options, the closest is A)6.24e-7, but perhaps I should recompute the ratio.

Wait, let's compute 0.02803 /0.036685 exactly.

0.02803 ÷0.036685.

Let me set it up as a division:

2803 ÷ 36685.

We can compute this as:

2803 ÷36685 ≈ 0.0764.

Wait, no, 0.02803 is 28.03 mM, 0.036685 is 36.685 mM.

28.03 /36.685 ≈ 0.764.

So pH=7.209 + log(0.764)=7.209 -0.115=7.094.

Hmm, perhaps I should check if the actual ratio is exactly 0.764, causing the pH to be exactly 7.094.

Wait, perhaps using the exact value for log(0.764).

Let me compute log(0.764) more accurately.

Log(0.764) = log(7.64 ×1e-1) = log(7.64) -1.

Log(7.64)=0.8838 (because log(7)=0.8451, log(8)=0.9031. 7.64 is closer to 8.

Wait, using a calculator approach:

Log(7.64) ≈ 0.8838.

So log(0.764) = 0.8838 -1= -0.1162.

So pH=7.209 -0.1162=7.0928.

Compute [H+]=10^(-7.0928)=?

7.0928 = 7 + 0.0928.

10^(-7.0928)=1e-7 ×10^(-0.0928).

10^(-0.0928)= antilog(-0.0928)= 1/(10^0.0928).

Compute 10^0.0928:

We know that 10^0.07918 =0.8 (since log(0.8)= -0.09691, which is approximately 0.09691). Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 10^0.0928.

Alternatively, using the approximation:

ln(10^0.0928) = 0.0928 * ln(10) ≈ 0.0928 *2.3026≈0.2134.

e^0.2134≈ 1.237.

So 10^0.0928= approx 1.237.

So 10^(-0.0928)=1/1.237≈0.808.

So [H+]=1e-7 *0.808=8.08e-8 M.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave 8.23e-8. Hmmm, perhaps more precise.

Wait, 10^0.0928.

We can compute it as:

We know that 10^0.09 ≈ 1.230, 10^0.0928 would be a bit higher.

Using taylor series:

Let me consider x=0.0928.

We can write 10^x = e^(x ln 10)= e^(0.0928 *2.302585)= e^(0.2133).

Compute e^0.2133.

e^0.2=1.2214, e^0.2133≈ let's compute using taylor expansion around 0.2.

f(x)=e^x, f'(x)=e^x.

e^0.2133 = e^(0.2 +0.0133) = e^0.2 * e^0.0133.

e^0.0133≈1 +0.0133 + (0.0133)^2/2 + (0.0133)^3/6.

0.0133^2=0.00017689, divided by 2 is 8.84e-5.

0.0133^3= 2.35e-6, divided by 6≈3.92e-7.

So e^0.0133≈ 1.0133 +0.0000884 +0.000000392 ≈1.0133888.

So e^0.2133≈1.2214 *1.0133888≈1.2214 *1.0134.

1.2214 *1.0134 ≈ 1.2214 + (1.2214 *0.0134)=1.2214 + 0.01636=1.2378.

So 10^0.0928=1.2378.

Thus, 10^(-0.0928)=1/1.2378≈0.808.

So [H+]=8.08e-8 M.

Then, [PO4^3-]= (1.8e-12 *0.02803)/8.08e-8.

Compute numerator:1.8e-12 *0.02803=5.0454e-14.

Divide by 8.08e-8: 5.0454e-14 /8.08e-8= (5.0454/8.08 )e-6.

5.0454/8.08= approx 0.6246.

So [PO4^3-]=0.6246e-6=6.246e-7 M.

Ah, so that's approximately 6.246e-7 M, which rounds to 6.25e-7.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which matches this value.

So the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we start by analyzing the given data. The solution contains 1.00 g each of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, with molecular weights of 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. The solution volume is 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). 

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each compound
- Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molecular Weight}} = \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007337 \, \text{mol}
  \]
- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molecular Weight}} = \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005606 \, \text{mol}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations in the solution
- Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄):  
  \[
  [\text{H₂PO₄}^-] = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.007337}{0.2} \approx 0.036685 \, \text{M}
  \]
- Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O):  
  \[
  [\text{HPO₄}^{2-}] = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.005606}{0.2} \approx 0.02803 \, \text{M}
  \]

### Step 3: Determine the pH of the solution
The solution is a buffer system involving H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. The relevant equilibrium constant is \( K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \), and its \( pK_a \) is:  
\[
pK_a = -\log(K_a2) = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.209
\]
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = pK_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄}^-]}\right)
\]
Substitute the concentrations:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.209 + \log\left(\frac{0.02803}{0.036685}\right)
\]
\[
\frac{0.02803}{0.036685} \approx 0.764, \quad \log(0.764) \approx -0.115
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.209 - 0.115 = 7.094
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the concentration of PO₄³⁻
The formation of PO₄³⁻ occurs via the reaction:  
\[
\text{HPO₄}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{PO₄}^{3-}
\]
The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \). Using the expression for \( K_a3 \):  
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{PO₄}^{3-}]}{[\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}
\]
Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄}^{3-}]\):  
\[
[\text{PO₄}^{3-}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄}^{2-}]}{[\text{H}^+]}
\]
From the pH, \([\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.094} \approx 8.08 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\). Substituting the values:  
\[
[\text{PO₄}^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02803)}{8.08 \times 10^{-8}}
\]
\[
[\text{PO₄}^{3-}] = \frac{5.0454 \times 10^{-14}}{8.08 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.246 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Final Answer
The concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution is approximately \( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
