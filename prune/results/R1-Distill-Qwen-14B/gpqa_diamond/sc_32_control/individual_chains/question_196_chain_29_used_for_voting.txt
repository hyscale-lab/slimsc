Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: Consider a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. What's the maximum speed v_max of the mass? The options are given as A to D.

Wait, okay, so first I need to recall what a harmonic oscillator is. In classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. The force is F = -kx, which is Hooke's law. The motion is periodic, like a mass on a spring.

But this question is about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Oh right, relativistic implies that we need to consider effects from Einstein's theory of relativity, probably using the relativistic expressions for momentum and energy instead of the classical ones.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of the oscillator can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy is (1/2)kA² at maximum displacement, and this converts into kinetic energy at the equilibrium point. So (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA², leading to v_max = sqrt(kA²/m) = (A sqrt(k/m)).

Wait, looking at the options, option C is v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which matches the non-relativistic case. But since the question is relativistic, that can't be the correct answer. So we can probably eliminate option C.

But wait, the question is about maximum speed, so in relativity, we have to account for the fact that as speed approaches the speed of light c, relativistic effects become significant. So the momentum isn't simply mv, but gamma times mv, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So in a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy isn't just kinetic plus potential as in the classical case. Instead, the total energy is the sum of relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy from the spring.

Let me think about the energies. The total energy E of the oscillator is the sum of the rest mass energy (mc²) plus the kinetic energy (which is relativistic) and the potential energy from the spring.

Wait, no, actually, in the case of a harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) is conserved. So in the non-relativistic case, it's (1/2)mv² + (1/2)kx². But in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², and the potential energy is (1/2)kx². So the sum of these should equal the total energy at any point.

At maximum displacement x = A, the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. So E_total = (1/2)kA² + mc². Wait, no, actually, wait. Because in relativity, the rest mass energy is mc², and the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So the total energy when x=A would be mc² + (1/2)kA².

But wait, is that correct? Or does the total energy include the rest mass plus the potential energy? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

In the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², and this equals (1/2)mv_max² at x=0. But when including relativity, the kinetic energy is different, and the total energy would be the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy plus the potential energy.

Wait, no—actually, in the relativistic case, the total energy includes the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy. Wait, but the potential energy is part of the mechanical energy. Hmm, perhaps the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energy and the mechanical energy? Or is the rest mass energy part of the mechanical energy?

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by considering that the system's total energy is conserved, including rest mass energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy.

So at maximum displacement x = A, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero (if we're not considering relativistic kinetic energy, but wait—the rest mass is always there. Wait, no, wait. In relativity, the total energy is gamma mc², which includes the rest mass energy. So perhaps the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy.

Wait, maybe I should model the energy conservation between the two extreme points. At x = A, the velocity is zero, so the total energy is E = mc² + (1/2)kA². Because the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the rest mass energy is mc².

But wait, does the potential energy include the rest mass? Or is it considered separately? I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think. In the classical case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So E = (1/2)kA².

But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc², so the total energy is mc² + (gamma -1) mc² = gamma mc². So the total energy E would be gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA². Wait, that can't be right because when x=0, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy would be maximum. So at x=0, E should be equal to the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy.

Wait, perhaps E is the sum of the rest mass energy and the mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential). So E = mc² + (kinetic + potential). But when x = A, kinetic is zero, so E = mc² + (1/2)kA². But when x = 0, potential is zero, so E = mc² + (relativistic kinetic energy) = gamma mc².

So setting them equal, at x=A: E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At x=0: E = gamma mc².

So equate the two: gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Divide both sides by mc²:

gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²).

Wait, but gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So let's write that equation:

1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²).

Hmm, okay. So then, solving for v_max. Let me denote (kA²)/(2 mc²) as a term to simplify. Let me call that term 'a' for a moment. So:

gamma = 1 + a,

where a = (kA²)/(2 mc²).

So,

gamma = 1 + a.

But gamma is also 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + a.

Take reciprocal of both sides:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + a).

Then square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + a)^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2.

So,

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + a)^2 ].

Simplify the RHS:

1 - [1/(1 + a)^2] = [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2.

Compute numerator: (1 + a)^2 -1 = 1 + 2a + a² -1 = 2a + a².

So,

v² = c² [ (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2 ) ].

But wait, the denominator is (1 + a)^2 = 1 + 2a + a², so this fraction is (2a + a²)/(1 + 2a + a²) = [a(2 + a)] / (a + 1)^2.

But perhaps this isn't simplifying to anything obvious. Let me plug back in 'a' in terms of k, m, A, c.

Remember that a = (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So,

v² = c² [ (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2 ) ]

Let me compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2a + a² = a(2 + a).

Denominator: (1 + a)^2 = 1 + 2a + a².

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to express v.

Wait, another approach. Let's re-express gamma:

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) = [ 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ] / (2 m c^2 )

Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, solving for v in terms of gamma.

But perhaps I should look at the answer options to see which one matches.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2m))^2 )

Wait, let me compute the expression I derived. I have:

v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + a)^2 ), where a = (kA^2)/(2 mc^2).

So,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2 mc^2 ))^2 )

That expression can be rewritten as:

v = c sqrt( [ (1 + (kA^2)/(2 mc^2 ))^2 - 1 ] / (1 + (kA^2)/(2 mc^2 ))^2 )

The numerator inside the sqrt is (1 + 2a + a² - 1) = 2a + a².

Hmm, let me compute that fraction again. Let me define a = (kA²)/(2 mc²).

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ (2a + a^2) ] / (1 + a)^2.

Factor numerator: a(2 + a) = a(a + 2) = a(a + 2).

Denominator: (1 + a)^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ a(a + 2) ] / (1 + a)^2.

Hmm, can I factor this more? Let's see:

(a + 2) = (a +1) +1.

Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor a/(1+a).

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ a(a + 2) ] / (a+1)^2 = c^2 [ a (a + 2) ) / (a+1)^2 ]

Let me compute a+2 in terms of a:

a = (kA^2)/(2 m c²)

a + 2 = (kA^2)/(2 m c²) + 2 = [kA² + 4 m c^2 ] / (2 m c^2 )

Hmm, but I'm not seeing a clear simplification. Maybe I should express everything in terms of (kA^2)/(2 m c^2) being a small term, but I don't think that's necessarily the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should rearrange the equation I had earlier.

Going back:

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)

Which is,

gamma = [ 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ] / (2 m c^2 )

So,

gamma = [ 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ] / (2 m c^2 )

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Let me invert both sides:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / [ 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) ]

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1 / [ 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) ]^2

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/[1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)]^2

Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 m c^2)^2 to see if any simplification occurs, but perhaps it's not helpful.

Alternatively, let me factor 1/(1 + a)^2, where a is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2). So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + a)^2 ].

Which is,

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2 ]

= c² [ ( (1 + a)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + a)^2 )

(1 + a)^2 -1 = 2a + a^2.

So,

v² = c² (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2.

Substituting a = (k A^2)/(2 m c²):

v² = c² [ 2*(k A^2)/(2 m c²) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ] / [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) ]^2

Simplify numerator:

2*(k A^2)/(2 m c²) = (k A^2)/(m c²).

So,

numerator: (k A²)/(m c²) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4) )

Factor out (k A^2)/(4 m² c^4):

Wait, perhaps better to factor:

= (k A^2)/(m c^2) [ 1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2) ) ]

Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

But perhaps I can factor the denominator.

Denominator is [ (2 m c² + k A^2) / (2 m c^2) ) ]^2.

Wait, because 1 + a = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) = [2 m c² + k A^2 ]/(2 m c²)

So,

Denominator = [ (2 m c² + k A^2) / (2 m c²) ) ]^2 = (2 m c² + k A^2)^2 / (4 m² c^4 )

So, the whole expression for v² becomes:

v² = c² * [ (k A^2)/(m c^2) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ] / [ (2 m c² + k A^2)^2 / (4 m² c^4) ) ]

This seems complicated, but perhaps I can multiply numerator and denominator by 4 m² c^4 to simplify.

Numerator after multiplication:

c² * [ (k A^2)/(m c^2) * 4 m² c^4 + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4) *4 m² c^4 ) ]

= c² * [ 4 m k A² c² + k² A^4 ]

Denominator after multiplication:

[ (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 ]

So,

v² = [ c² (4 m k A² c² + k^2 A^4) ] / (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2

Factor numerator: c² k A² (4 m c² + k A² )

Wait, let me see:

4 m k A² c^2 + k² A^4 = k A² (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )

So,

v² = c^2 * [ k A² (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, let me factor the denominator as (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2. In the numerator, 4 m c² + k A^2 is 2*(2 m c²) + k A^2. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me check:

The denominator after substitution is (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2. The numerator inside the brackets is:

4 m k A^2 c^2 + k^2 A^4 = k A^2 [ 4 m c^2 + k A^2 ]

So,

v² = c² * [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2

Hmm, perhaps I can split the denominator.

Let me write (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

If the numerator has (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ), which is 2*(2 m c^2) + k A^2. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor 4 m c^2 + k A^2 = 2*(2 m c^2) + k A^2 = 2*(something) + another term.

Not seeing a clear path here, but perhaps I can factor 2 m c^2 as a common term. Let me try to factor the numerator.

Numerator inside the big fraction:

k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) = k A^2 [ 4 m c^2 + k A^2 ]

Denominator: (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, not sure. Maybe I need to look back at the answer options.

Looking again:

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2m))^2 )

Hmm, let's compute 1/(1 - (kA^2)/(2m))^2 inside the sqrt. That would make it sqrt(1 + something), which might be larger than 1. But in our expression, v is less than c, as sqrt of something less than 1.

Wait, but in the options, some have 1/(1 - ... )^2, others have sqrt(1 + ... ), etc.

Alternatively, perhaps I can rearrange the equation for v.

We had:

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Let me take reciprocal:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1 / [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ]

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/[ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ]

= [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 - 1 ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2*(k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4 ) ) - 1

= ( 2*(k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

= (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

So,

v² = c^2 [ (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4 ) ) ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2

Factor out (k A^2)/(4 m² c^4 ) from numerator:

= c^2 [ ( (k A^2)/(4 m² c^4 ) ) * (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) ] / [ ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 ]

Wait, denominator is (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 = ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) ) )^2.

So,

v² = c^2 * [ (k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ))/(4 m² c^4 ) ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 / (4 m^2 c^4 ) ) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator:

= c^2 * [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) * 4 m^2 c^4 ) ] / [ (4 m² c^4 ) (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ) ]

Wait, no, that's not accurate. Let me compute it correctly.

Numerator:

c^2 * [ (k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) / (4 m² c^4 ) ) ]

Denominator:

[ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 / (4 m² c^4 ) ) ]

So, when you divide, the denominator becomes:

(2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 / (4 m² c^4 ) )

So,

v² = [ c^2 * k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / (4 m² c^4 ) ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 / (4 m² c^4 ) ) ]

The 4 m² c^4 terms cancel.

So,

v² = [ c^2 * k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )

Hmm, perhaps factor out 2 m c^2:

4 m c^2 = 2*(2 m c^2 )

So,

4 m c^2 + k A^2 = 2*(2 m c^2 ) + k A^2 = (2 m c^2 ) *2 + k A^2.

Not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps factor denominator:

(2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 = [2 m c^2 (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ]^2

But that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps write the numerator as (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) = (2 m c^2 ) * 2 + k A^2 = 2 (2 m c^2) + k A^2.

Hmm, not seeing a clear path to match the options.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the options again.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, let's compute that.

sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + a)^2 ) = sqrt( [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2 )

Which is sqrt( (2a + a^2 )/(1 +a)^2 ) ) = sqrt( a (2 + a ) ) / (1 + a )

But in our expression, v^2 = c^2 [ (2a + a^2 ) ] / (1 + a )^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2a + a^2) ) / (1 + a )

= c * sqrt( a (2 + a) ) / (1 + a )

Hmm, but this doesn't directly match any of the options.

Wait, let me compute each option's expression for v_max and see which one matches our equation.

Option A: v = c sqrt( 1 + [1/(1 - (kA^2)/(2m))^2 ] )

That would be sqrt(1 + [some term]) which would be larger than 1, implying v > c, which is impossible. So Option A is probably incorrect.

Option B: v = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2)/(2m c^2 )) )

Again, the term inside the sqrt is 1 + something positive, so v > c. Not possible. So B is wrong.

Option C: v = sqrt( kA^2/m ), which is the non-relativistic case. So since the question is relativistic, C is probably incorrect.

Option D: v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

So, let's compute inside the sqrt:

1 - [1/(1 + a )^2 ] where a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Which is exactly what I derived earlier. So,

v^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 ]

So the expression for v is c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 )

Which matches option D.

Wait no, looking at option D, the expression is:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I have here. So the correct answer should be option D.

Wait, but let me just double-check.

The way I derived it, the velocity is:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which is exactly option D. So the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy conservation principles. The total energy of the system is conserved and includes the rest mass energy, relativistic kinetic energy, and potential energy.

At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the velocity is zero, and the total energy is purely potential:  
\[
E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

At equilibrium (\( x = 0 \)), the velocity is maximum, and the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energy and the relativistic kinetic energy:  
\[
E = \gamma mc^2,
\]
where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

Equating the two expressions for \( E \), we get:  
\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Dividing through by \( mc^2 \):  
\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \):  
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:  
\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}},
\]
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):  
\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Thus, the maximum speed is:  
\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, it matches **Option D**. The other options are incorrect because:  
- **Option A** and **Option B** imply \( v > c \), which is unphysical.  
- **Option C** corresponds to the non-relativistic case and does not account for relativistic effects.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
