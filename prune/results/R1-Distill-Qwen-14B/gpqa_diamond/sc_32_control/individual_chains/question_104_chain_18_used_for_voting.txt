Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The question is about comparing the orbital periods of the two planets based on the detected shifts in the spectral lines.

The RV method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. When the star moves towards us, the spectral lines shift to a shorter wavelength (blue shift), and when it moves away, they shift to a longer wavelength (red shift). The size of this shift depends on the velocity of the star caused by the orbiting planet.

So, each planet causes its star to move, and the shift in the spectral lines tells us about the velocity. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the RV method's signal (the velocity semi-amplitude) depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Oh right, the formula is something like K = (v) = (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ) )... Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the exact formula, but perhaps a better approach is to think about the relation between the velocity semi-amplitude and the orbital period.

The RV method's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )^(1/2) )

Wait, maybe that's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, I remember that for two planets around the same star, the velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. But wait, maybe the formula is K ∝ (M_p / M_star^(1/3)) / P^(1/3)}? Hmm, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the formula for the RV semi-amplitude.

The formula for K (the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity) is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, but since both planets have circular orbits, e is zero, so that term is 1. Also, if M_p << M_star, which is the case here because Neptune is much less massive than the Sun, then M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies a bit.

So simplifying, K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( P )^(1/3) ) )

Wait, let me get the correct formula. I think the correct formula is:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ] * (1 / ( (P * (1 - e^2))^(1/2) )) )

But since e=0, and M_p << M_star, this reduces to:

K ≈ (G * M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/2)) ) * (1/(1)) )

Wait, no, maybe I should think about the formula more correctly. I think I might be mixing up the terms. Let me look it up mentally. Another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (2 π G ) / (c P ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

Hmm, perhaps I should instead remember that for a given star and planet mass, the RV signal K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Wait, no, I think K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ). Wait, perhaps I should find a relation between K and P.

If I have two planets with the same mass (both Neptune-like), and same star mass (solar), then the K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)). So if K doubles, P would be 1/(2^(3)) times as much? Wait, no, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3). Therefore, (K1/K2)^3 = (P2/P1).

Wait, let's think in terms of K1 and K2. Let me write the ratio:

K1 / K2 = ( (P2 / P1) )^(1/3) )

So, if I can find the ratio K1/K2, then I can cube it to find (P2/P1), and then take the cube root to get (P2/P1) itself.

Wait, wait, let's make this clear. Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), when P increases, K decreases. So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), which implies that P ∝ 1/K^(3).

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's say K = constant / P^(1/3). So if K1 and K2 are the velocities for two planets, then:

K1 = C / P1^(1/3)

K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

So taking the ratio K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) ) / (C / P2^(1/3)) ) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Therefore, (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

So, the ratio of P2 to P1 is (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, no, because (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3), so (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

So, P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3.

So the question is, what is the ratio P2/P1, given that K1 is 5 mA and K2 is 7 mA.

Wait, wait, the problem says that the shift for planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7. So K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

So (K1/K2) = 5/7.

Then (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, but that would mean P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Let me make sure I got the ratio right.

Wait, K1 is the velocity for planet #1, K2 is the velocity for planet #2.

From the formula, K1 = C / P1^(1/3)

Similarly, K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

So the ratio K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) ) / (C / P2^(1/3)) ) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So to get P2/P1, cube both sides:

(K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

So in this problem, K1 is 5, K2 is7.

So (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

5/7 is approximately 0.7143. 0.7143^3 ≈ let's compute that.

0.7143 * 0.7143 = approx 0.5102. Then multiply by 0.7143 again: 0.5102 * 0.7143 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 is approximately 0.364. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter.

But the question is asking, how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. So if P2 is 0.364 * P1, then P2 is 0.364 times as long as P1. So it's shorter, not longer. So the question is probably worded such that it's asking the ratio P2/P1, but the options are presented as how many times longer.

Wait, let me read the question again. The question says, "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So it's asking for P2 / P1.

Wait, we found P2 / P1 is approximately 0.364. That is, P2 is about 0.364 times P1, meaning P2 is shorter. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let me think again because maybe I got the ratio backwards. Because if K is higher, does that mean a shorter period?

Yes, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So a higher K would imply a smaller P. So planet #2 has a higher K (7 mA) compared to planet #1 (5 mA), so planet #2 has a shorter period. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.364, which is option A.

So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter, meaning that the answer is approximately 0.36 times as long. So the correct option is A) ~0.36.

The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity signal, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, \( P \), for planets with similar masses and around stars of the same mass. Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

For two planets, the ratio of their orbital periods can be derived from the ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

In this problem, Planet #1 has an RV semi-amplitude \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), and Planet #2 has \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

First, calculate \( \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.7143 \). Then, cube this value:

\[
\left(0.7143\right)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately \( 0.364 \) times the orbital period of Planet #1. This means Planet #2's orbital period is shorter than Planet #1's. Since the question asks how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1's, the answer is approximately \( 0.36 \).

**Critical Analysis of Options:**
- **A) ~0.36**: Matches the calculated value of \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \).
- **B) ~1.40**: Incorrect, as it suggests Planet #2's period is longer, which contradicts the relationship between \( K \) and \( P \).
- **C) ~1.96**: Incorrect, as it also suggests a longer period for Planet #2.
- **D) ~0.85**: Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value.

The correct answer is **A**, as Planet #2's orbital period is approximately \( 0.36 \) times that of Planet #1.
