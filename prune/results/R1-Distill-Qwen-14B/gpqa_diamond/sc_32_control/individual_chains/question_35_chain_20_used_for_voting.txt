Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, muons are elementary particles, right? So I'm dealing with angular momentum here, which reminds me of spin operators. 

The question says that the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Right, for any matrix operator, the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0. Since Ay is 2x2, this should be manageable.

Let me first write down S. So S is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Then, c is h/(4π), so Ay = c * S. But wait, the eigenvalues of Ay would be c times the eigenvalues of S, because if S has eigenvalues λ, then cS has eigenvalues cλ. So maybe I can find the eigenvalues of S first.

The eigenvalues of S can be found by solving det(S - λI) = 0. The determinant is (0-λ)(0-λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - ( (-i)(i) ). Let's compute that: (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant is λ² -1. Setting this to zero: λ² -1 =0 → λ=±1.

So the eigenvalues of S are 1 and -1. Then, the eigenvalues of Ay would be c times these, so c*1 and c*(-1). So c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues a (since the problem calls the eigenvalue a) are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). 

Wait, but the options mention other possibilities. Looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because eigenvalues are real or complex. Oh wait, wait—angular momentum operators usually have real eigenvalues when considering their components because they're Hermitian. Let me check if Ay is Hermitian.

Ay is c·S, and c is a real constant. What about S? Let's see. The matrix S is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. The conjugate transpose of S would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is the same as S. Because if you swap rows and columns and take complex conjugates, you end up with the same matrix. So S is Hermitian. Then, Ay is also Hermitian because it's a real multiple of a Hermitian matrix. So eigenvalues of Ay should be real, not complex. 

So the eigenvalues a are ±h/(4π). That would mean that any option suggesting complex eigenvalues is wrong. Looking at the options, option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh, which would mean the eigenvalues are complex, which can't be. Option B has eigenvalues with real and imaginary parts, also implying complex eigenvalues which is wrong. So options A and B can't be correct because the eigenvalues are real.

Now, looking at the options C and D. Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Wait, in quantum mechanics, for angular momentum, the eigenfunctions of a component (like Ay) are also eigenfunctions of the square of the angular momentum. Because A² commutes with each component, so their eigenstates are shared. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's also an eigenfunction of A². But Az is another component, and since [Ay, Az] = iħ A something (I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact commutator, but I think it's non-zero). So Ay and Az don't commute, so their eigenfunctions are different. So the eigenfunctions of Ay can't be eigenfunctions of Az. So option C says that φ can be an eigenfunction of A² but not Az. That seems correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Hmm, I'm not sure I quite get that. The basis functions of a matrix operator are usually the eigenvectors if the operator is diagonal in that basis. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, it will have two eigenvectors, which form a basis for the space. So the eigenfunctions φ form a basis for the matrix operator. I think that's correct as well. Because any matrix can be diagonalized in its eigenbasis. So D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. So that would be correct.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is, during the calculation, which statement is correct. So, in the calculation process, what would be correct.

Option D is about the basis. If the matrix operator is 2x2, then any set of two linearly independent eigenvectors would form a basis. Since Ay is 2x2 and has two eigenvalues (assuming they are non-degenerate), the eigenvectors are a basis. So statement D is correct.

So now between options C and D. Let me re-express the statements.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. As I thought, since A² commutes with Ay, their eigenfunctions are same. But Az doesn't commute, so eigenfunctions are different. Thus, eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay. So the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator. Since the operator is 2x2, yes, any two eigenvectors (assuming they are linearly independent) form a basis. So statement D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about what you would consider correct during the calculation. So both C and D might have correct aspects, but perhaps only one is correct.

Let me think about the options again.

Looking back at the problem statement: the matrix S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. And c is h/(4π). So Ay = c * S.

Wait, let's compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

The eigenvalues are c * (1 and -1), so eigenvalues a are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So real, as we thought.

Now, the eigenvectors of Ay would be the same as those of S, scaled by the same factor. So let's find the eigenvectors of S.

For S, eigenvalue λ =1: solve (S - I)v=0.

S - I = [[-1, -i], [i, -1]].

The equations are:

-1*v1 -i*v2 =0 → v1 = (-i v2)/(-1) → v1 = i v2.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [i, 1] (since v2 can be 1). So [i, 1] is an eigenvector for λ=1.

Similarly for λ=-1: (S + I)v=0.

S + I = [[1, -i], [i, 1]].

Equations: v1 -i v2 =0 → v1 = i v2.

So the eigenvector is [i, 1], same as before? Wait, no, because when λ=-1, S - (-1)I = S + I. So the equations are v1 -i v2=0 and i v1 + v2=0.

Wait, let me recompute: S + I is [[1, -i], [i, 1]]. So the equations are:

1*v1 -i*v2 =0 → v1 = i v2.

i*v1 +1*v2 =0 → substituting v1 =i v2: i*(i v2) + v2 = (-1 v2) + v2 = 0 → 0=0.

So the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of [i, 1].

Wait, same as when λ=1. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, for λ=1, S - I is [[-1, -i], [i, -1]]. The equations are -v1 -i v2=0 → v1 = -i v2.

So for v2 =1, v1= -i.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [ -i, 1].

Wait, maybe I should do it properly.

For λ=1:

(S - I) = [[-1, -i], [i, -1]]

So each row:

Row 1: -1 * v1 -i * v2 = 0 → v1 = (-i v2)/ (-1) → v1 = i v2.

Row 2: i v1 -1 v2 = 0 → substituting v1= i v2 → i*(i v2) - v2 = (i^2 v2) -v2 → (-v2) -v2 = -2 v2 =0 → v2=0. But if v2=0, then v1=0, which is trivial. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvectors.

Wait no, perhaps I should compute the null space of S - I.

The matrix S - I is [[-1, -i], [i, -1]].

Let me write it as:

[-1  -i]
[ i  -1 ]

So the determinant is (-1)(-1) - (-i)(i) = 1 - ( (-i)(i) ) = 1 - ( (-i^2) ) → i squared is -1, so (-i)(i)= -i² = 1. So determinant is 1 -1=0, which it must be because we have eigenvalues.

To find the eigenvectors, we can set up the equations.

From row 1: (-1) v1 + (-i) v2 =0 → v1 = (-i v2)/ (-1) → v1 = i v2.

So any vector [v1, v2] = [i v2, v2] is an eigenvector. So taking v2=1, the eigenvector is [i, 1].

Similarly, for λ=-1: S + I = [[1, -i], [i, 1]]

Equations: v1 -i v2 =0 → v1= i v2.

From row 2: i v1 + v2 =0 → i (i v2) + v2 = (i^2 v2) + v2 = (-1 v2) + v2 =0 → 0=0.

So eigenvectors are [i v2, v2], same as [i, 1], but wait, no—when v2=1, the vector is [i, 1], but for λ=-1, isn't the vector the same? That can't be right because eigenvectors for different eigenvalues should be different.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the matrices. Let me recompute for λ=-1.

Wait, when λ=-1, S - (-1)I = S + I.

The matrix is [[1, -i], [i, 1]]

Equations from row 1: v1 -i v2 =0 → v1 = i v2.

Equations from row 2: i v1 +v2 =0 → substituting v1 =i v2: i*(i v2) + v2 = (i^2 v2) +v2 = (-v2) +v2 =0 → 0=0.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [i, 1].

Wait, so both eigenvalues have the same eigenvectors? That can't be. Because if a matrix has two distinct eigenvalues, the eigenvectors should be different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think about the matrix S.

S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

It's a 2x2 matrix. The trace is 0, determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i²) → 0 - (1) = -1. Wait, no, wait: (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is 0*0 - (-i)(i) = 0 - (1) = -1.

Wait, wait. So determinant of S is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - [ (-i)(i) ].

Let me compute (-i)(i) = -i^2 = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is 0 - 1 = -1.

But earlier when I computed the eigenvalues for S, I got λ^2 =1 → λ=±1. So the product of eigenvalues is 1, but the determinant is -1. Hmm, that can't be. Because for a 2x2 matrix, the product of the eigenvalues equals the determinant. So my earlier calculation must have been wrong.

So, let me recalculate the eigenvalues.

The characteristic equation is det(S - λ I) =0.

(S - λ I) is [[-λ, -i], [i, -λ]]

Determinant: (-λ)(-λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - [ (-i)(i) ]

Compute (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

So determinant = λ² -1 =0 → λ²=1 → λ=±1.

But the product of eigenvalues (1)(-1)= -1, which equals the determinant. So that's correct.

Wait, okay, so the eigenvalues are 1 and -1.

So for λ=1, the eigenvectors are found from (S - I)v=0.

Which as we saw, leads to v1 =i v2. So the eigenvectors are multiples of [i, 1].

For λ=-1, (S + I)v=0 → v1 =i v2.

Wait, same eigenvectors? That can't be right because S is diagonalizable only if the eigenvectors are distinct.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the approach. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, S can be written as i times σ_y, where σ_y is the Pauli Y matrix. The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, and their eigenvalues are ±1.

Wait, the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is the same as i * σ_y.

So, S = i σ_y.

The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So S = i σ_y → the eigenvalues of S are i*(±1) → ±i.

Wait, wait! Oh, that's a mistake I made earlier. Because if S is i times σ_y, then the eigenvalues of S would be i times the eigenvalues of σ_y. Since σ_y has eigenvalues ±1, S has eigenvalues ±i.

Wait, wait, but earlier I thought S has eigenvalues 1 and -1. That was wrong because I forgot that S = i * σ_y. So S's eigenvalues are i and -i.

Wait, so let me correct that. So when I was calculating the eigenvalues of S earlier, I thought it had ±1, but that's incorrect. So the correct eigenvalues are ±i.

Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay are c times the eigenvalues of S. So Ay's eigenvalues are c*(i) and c*(-i).

Since c is h/(4π), that leads to eigenvalues (h/(4π))*i and -(h/(4π))i. So the eigenvalues are purely imaginary.

Wait, but earlier I thought S had eigenvalues ±1. So I must have made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, let me recompute. The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me compute S^2.

S^2 = [[0, -i],[i, 0]] multiplied by [[0, -i],[i, 0]].

First element (1,1): (0)(0) + (-i)(i) = 0 + (-i^2) = 0 +1 =1.

(1,2): (0)(-i) + (-i)(0) =0.

(2,1): (i)(0) + (0)(i) =0.

(2,2): (i)(-i) + (0)(0) = -i² +0 = 1.

So S^2 is [[1,0],[0,1]] = I. So S squared is identity matrix. Therefore, S^2 = I → (S - λ I)(S + λ I) =0 → λ^2 =1 → λ=±1. So wait, that's conflicting with the earlier conclusion that S is iσ_y.

Wait, no, because σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so S is the same as σ_y. So σ_y squared is I, so S^2 = I → eigenvalues are ±1. So that would imply that S has eigenvalues ±1. Then why did I think S was iσ_y earlier?

Wait, S is same as σ_y. So σ_y is Hermitian, has eigenvalues ±1. So S has eigenvalues ±1.

Wait, but I thought S was iσ_y. Hmm, no, because S is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which is the same as σ_y. Because σ_y is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. So S = σ_y.

So then, the eigenvalues are ±1, which I initially thought. So the eigenvalues of Ay are c*(±1) → ±c → ±h/(4π).

So that makes the eigenvalues of Ay real numbers, h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real.

So looking back at the options, only options C and D are about properties of the eigenfunctions, because A and B suggest complex eigenvalues which are wrong.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

As I thought earlier, A² commutes with Ay, so their eigenfunctions are the same. But Az doesn't commute with Ay, so their eigenfunctions are different. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is, which statement is correct during the calculation.

So the question is about what you would consider correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Both C and D seem correct. But let's re-examine the options.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Yes, because the matrix operator is 2x2 and has two eigenvectors. So any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of these eigenvectors. Thus, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator, so D is correct.

So both C and D seem correct. But wait, let me check the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay.

Wait, perhaps only one is correct, but I thought both are correct.

Wait, but let's think about the problem.

When you diagonalize Ay, the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

As for C, A² is the square of the angular momentum operator, which would have eigenvalues related to the magnitude squared. A² is proportional to the identity matrix in spin-1/2 systems, because for spin 1/2, A² has eigenvalue (ħ^2) s(s+1), where s=1/2. So A² would have the same eigenvalue for all states. Thus, any eigenstate of Ay would also be an eigenstate of A².

Since A² is a scalar multiple of identity, any vector is an eigenstate. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are indeed eigenfunctions of A². So C is correct.

So both C and D seem correct. But perhaps the options are mutually exclusive.

Wait, looking again, the options are:

C) The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

D) The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So, both statements are correct. But the question is which is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options don't allow for that.

Wait, but looking at the problem statement, the matrix S is given, and Ay is c*S. So the eigenvectors of Ay are the same as those of S, which are the same as those of σ_y. And since σ_y and A² commute, their eigenfunctions are shared.

Wait, but wait, A² is (c S)^2, because A = c S. So A^2 = c² S^2. Since S^2 is identity, A^2 = c² I. So A² is a multiple of identity, so any vector is an eigenstate.

Therefore, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So C is correct.

As for D, the eigenvectors of Ay form a basis for the space. So D is correct.

Hmm. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But the options only allow one correct answer. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct statements again.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. That's correct because A² is a multiple of identity, so any state is an eigenstate. So C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Which is true because any matrix can be diagonalized in its eigenbasis.

So both C and D seem correct. But perhaps the question is about what you would consider correct during the process.

Wait, looking back at the question: the question is, during the calculation, which statement will you consider correct.

So perhaps D is a statement about the basis of the matrix operator. Since the eigenvectors form the basis, D is correct.

But perhaps the question is which of the options is correct.

Wait, but the way the options are written, perhaps only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that D is correct. Let me think. The matrix operator's basis functions are the eigenvectors. So when you have a matrix, its basis is formed by the eigenvectors. So D is correct.

So both C and D are correct, but perhaps only one is. Wait, but the problem is presented as a multiple-choice with four options, presumably only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvalues.

Wait, I think the confusion comes from the matrix S. Let me recompute the eigenvalues properly.

Given S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

We can compute its eigenvalues by finding det(S - λ I) =0.

So determinant is:

| -λ      -i      |
| i      -λ      |

= λ^2 - ( (-i)(i) ) → λ^2 - ( (-i^2) ) → λ^2 - (1) → λ^2 =1 → λ=1 and λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues are 1 and -1, which are real. So Ay's eigenvalues are c*1 and c*(-1) → h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real. So option A and B are incorrect.

So the correct statements must be either C or D.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

As A² is (c S)^2 = c² S². Since S² is identity (as S^2 = I), A² is c² I. So any state is an eigenstate of A². So yes, C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Since Ay is 2x2 and has two eigenvectors, which form a basis, D is correct.

So both C and D are correct? But the options only allow one correct answer. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options again. Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Since A² is identity, any state is an eigenstate of A². So yes, C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Since the eigenvectors form a basis, D is correct.

But the problem gives four options and only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, and option D is incorrect. Why?

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. But the matrix operator is 2x2. The basis functions of the operator are the eigenvectors, which are the eigenfunctions. So D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the basis functions in the sense of the matrix representation. The matrix is given in the standard basis, but the eigenvectors form a different basis. So D is correct.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. But given the options, I think both C and D are correct statements. However, looking at the problem, perhaps the correct answer is option C because the other option (D) is a tautology, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the eigenfunctions of Ay are the same as the eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So C is correct.

So, the statements that are correct during the calculation are C and D. But since the options are mutually exclusive, perhaps only C is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should read the options again.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Yes, because the matrix operator is represented in some basis, and the eigenvectors form a basis (orthonormal) for the space. So D is correct.

So, I think both C and D are correct, but perhaps the only correct option given is C.

Wait, but looking at the options, the answer is probably C.

Wait, perhaps the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So, during the calculation, when finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement holds.

Wait, the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So, perhaps during the calculation, it's correct that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions (D), but that might not directly relate to the properties of A² or Az.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C because it's about the relation between operators, whereas D is a statement about the basis, which is a more general mathematical fact.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Since the eigenvalues are real, and the eigenfunctions are the same as those of A², and not of Az, I think option C is correct. So the correct answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( S \):**
   - The eigenvalues of \( S \) are determined by solving \( \det(S - \lambda I) = 0 \). The characteristic equation is:
     \[
     \lambda^2 - 1 = 0 \implies \lambda = \pm 1.
     \]
   - Thus, the eigenvalues of \( S \) are \( \lambda = 1 \) and \( \lambda = -1 \).

2. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( c \cdot \lambda \), where \( \lambda \) are the eigenvalues of \( S \). Substituting \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are:
     \[
     a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
     \]
   - These eigenvalues are real, as \( A_y \) is Hermitian.

3. **Eigenvectors of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvectors of \( A_y \) are the same as those of \( S \), as \( A_y \) is a scalar multiple of \( S \). For \( \lambda = 1 \), the eigenvector is proportional to \( [i, 1] \), and for \( \lambda = -1 \), it is proportional to \( [-i, 1] \).

4. **Analysis of Options:**
   - **Option A:** Suggests complex eigenvalues for \( A_y \), which is incorrect because \( A_y \) is Hermitian and its eigenvalues are real.
   - **Option B:** Also suggests complex eigenvalues, which is incorrect for the same reason as Option A.
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so their eigenfunctions are shared. However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so their eigenfunctions are different.
   - **Option D:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is correct because the eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2-dimensional space.

5. **Final Decision:**
   - Both Options C and D are correct. However, since the question asks for the statement considered correct **during the calculation**, Option C is more relevant because it directly addresses the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), which is a key aspect of the calculation.

### Conclusion:

The correct answer is **C**, as it accurately reflects the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \) during the calculation.

**Answer: C**
