Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Wait, right, the parallax (plx) of a star is the reciprocal of its distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance. That's something like 1 AU thing or something.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributed, so same number per unit volume, I guess. Oh wait, no, wait. If they're uniformly distributed in space, then the number density is constant. So in any volume, the number of stars depends on the size of that volume.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So I think we're looking at how the number of stars changes as you look at different ranges of parallax. Parallax increases as the distance decreases because plx = 1/d. So higher parallax means closer stars.

Wait, the problem is asking how the number of stars per unit plx range changes with plx. So for a given range of plx (like from plx to plx + dplx), how many stars are there?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number should depend on the volume of the spherical shell at that distance. Because as you look at stars with a certain parallax, you're effectively looking at a shell at a specific distance.

But wait, how does the volume of a shell relate to parallax? Let's think. The shell at distance d has a thickness dd, so its volume is the surface area of the sphere (4π d²) multiplied by the thickness (dd). So Volume = 4π d² dd.

But since plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that in. So Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd). But wait, wait, wait. The shell's thickness in distance is dd, but the corresponding change in parallax would be dplx. Because plx = 1/d, so dplx = -d/d² = -1/(d²) dd. Oh, so dplx = -(1/d²) dd.

Wait, but I'm interested in the change in plx, dplx. Let me rearrange that. So dd = -d² dplx. Substituting d = 1/plx, so dd = -(1/plx)^2 dplx.

Hmm, but I'm trying to express the volume in terms of plx. So Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * [ - (1/(plx)^2) dplx ) ]

Wait, that would be 4π (1/plx²) * ( -1/plx² dplx ). So Volume = -4π (1/plx^4) dplx. But the number of stars is proportional to the volume, so N = n * Volume, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume). Since n is constant, N ∝ Volume.

Wait, but the number of stars per unit plx range is the number per dplx. So for a given dplx, the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^4. But wait, the options are in terms of 1/plx to some power. So the number per unit plx is ~ 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that seems higher than I expected. Let me think again. So the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² n dd. Since n is stars per volume.

But we need to express this in terms of plx. So plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Substitute that in:

Number of stars = 4π (1/plx)^2 * n * ( thickness in d )

But the thickness in d is dd = (change in d) when plx changes by dplx. Since plx =1/d, so d = 1/plx. The derivative dd/dplx = -1/(plx²). So dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

Putting it all together:

N = 4π (1/plx²) * n * (-1/plx² dplx )

So N = -4π n (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars per unit dplx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx range decreases as 1/plx^4. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but I thought the number of stars in a shell depends on d², but when you account for the change in plx, it's (1/plx^4). Because the shell's volume is proportional to d², which is 1/plx², but the change in plx is related to 1/d². So when you take the derivative, it leads to higher power.

Alternatively, another approach: The number of stars in a given range of parallax (dplx) is the number of stars in the corresponding spherical shell. The volume of the shell is 4π (d)^2 dd. But since d = 1/plx, and dd = (dd/dplx) dplx. The derivative dd/dplx is -1/(plx)^2.

So the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/plx^2 dplx ) = -4π (1/plx^4) dplx. Since the number of stars is proportional to the volume, it's proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number per unit dplx is 1/plx^4.

So the answer must be option A, which is ~1/plx^4.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely related to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). For uniformly distributed stars, the number of stars in a spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). 

Since \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), we can express \( d \) as \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). Substituting this into the volume expression gives:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 dd = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} dd.
\]

The change in distance \( dd \) corresponding to a change in parallax \( d\text{plx} \) is related by \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Substituting this into the volume expression:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = -4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this volume is proportional to the volume, so the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). This means the number of stars per unit parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
