Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope, right? He's using an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, which is pretty high. He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, like less than 10^-9 Torr. The goal is to have as few gas molecules as possible because that helps with the electron microscopy by reducing scattering, I guess.

But even with that ultra-high vacuum, some gas particles are still there. The mass spectrometer detected them, so Mike knows they're present. He calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules, which is λ1. The mean free path, I remember, is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. It depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the size of the compartment.

Then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices something odd. The mean free path changes—it's now λ2, which is different from λ1. But wait, the temperature in the compartment is the same. So why would the mean free path change?

Hmm. I'm trying to recall what affects the mean free path. The main factors are pressure, temperature, and the size of the container. Oh wait, but here the pressure is already super low. So the mean free path is usually longer when the pressure is lower because the molecules don't collide as often.

Wait, but in this scenario, the pressure hasn't changed, right? Because the vacuum state is the same. So why would the mean free path change? Oh wait, but when the electron beam is on, maybe the gas molecules are getting excited or ionized? Or maybe the electron beam is causing some other effect.

Oh! Right, when high-energy electrons pass through the gas, they can cause the gas molecules to ionize. So the gas molecules might become charged. Charged particles in a vacuum might behave differently. They could stick to the walls of the compartment or get accelerated by the electric fields in the microscope.

Wait, but the mean free path is about how far a molecule travels before colliding with another molecule or a wall. If the gas is neutral, they collide with each other. But if they're ionized, perhaps they interact with the electron beam or the walls more frequently.

Ah, so when Mike turns on the electron beam, the gas molecules could become ionized. Ionized particles would have a different behavior. They might have a shorter mean free path because they might interact more with the walls or other charged particles, or maybe the ions are more likely to stick to surfaces, reducing their movement.

Wait, another thought: in a vacuum, the mean free path is longer because there's not much to collide with. But if the electrons are scattering off the gas molecules, that could increase the effective pressure or change the dynamics. Wait, but the pressure is still the same, just the presence of the electron beam causing some change.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas to heat up. Oh, but the question says the temperature remained the same. So that's not it.

Wait, another angle: The mean free path λ is given by λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*p), where d is the diameter of the molecule, p is pressure, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature. But if the pressure is constant, and T is same, then λ1 and λ2 should be same. But in the question, it's different. So why?

Wait, maybe there's another factor. Oh, wait, I think when the electron beam is on, it might cause the gas molecules to have more energy. So the mean free path depends on the speed of the molecules. If the molecules are moving faster, the mean free path increases. But wait, if the temperature is the same, the average kinetic energy remains the same, so the speed shouldn't change. Unless the beam is causing some local heating, but the problem states the temperature is same, so that's not it.

Wait, but perhaps the presence of the electron beam introduces additional forces. For instance, charged particles (like electrons) could cause the gas molecules to ionize, and then those ions might have a different effective diameter or might interact more with the walls. Alternatively, the ions could be accelerated by the electric fields in the microscope, which would cause them to move more quickly, effectively increasing their velocity and thus the mean free path.

Wait, but if the ions are moving faster, that would increase the mean free path. But the problem says that after starting the beam, the mean free path becomes λ2. So if λ2 is less than λ1, that would mean the mean free path is shorter, which implies that the effective pressure is higher or the molecule interactions are more frequent.

Wait, but why would the mean free path decrease? Under the same pressure and temperature, λ should remain same. So perhaps something else is at play.

Another thought: the electron beam is a column of electrons that the gas molecules might interact with. So perhaps the gas molecules are being scattered by the electrons in the beam, leading to more collisions. But wait, the mean free path is about collisions between gas molecules, not with other particles (like electrons). Oh, but wait, the question says that the mean free path is based on electron scattering with gas molecules. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, the question says that Mike observed a change in the mean free path based on electron scattering. So when he turned on the beam, he noticed that the mean free path for the gas molecules changed. So perhaps the process of electron scattering affects the gas molecules in a way that alters their behavior.

So, when the electron beam is off, the gas molecules are neutral and perhaps have a certain mean free path. When the beam is on, the electrons might strip electrons from the gas molecules, ionizing them. Now, the gas is a plasma or contains ions. How does that affect the mean free path?

In a plasma, the mean free path can be longer because the ions are heavier and might have less frequent collisions. Wait, no, ions can have different interactions. Or perhaps, if the gas becomes partially ionized, the effective pressure changes. Wait, but the physical pressure hasn't changed, it's the same ultra-high vacuum.

But wait, if the gas is ionized, the effective pressure might not be the same. Or perhaps, the ionized particles have different ways of interacting. Alternatively, the presence of charged particles could cause them to stick to the walls of the compartment, effectively reducing the number of particles in the compartment, which would increase the mean free path. Because if there are fewer particles, each travels further before a collision.

Wait, that makes sense. If the gas molecules are neutral, their mean free path is λ1. When the electron beam is on, some of them get ionized. Now, the ions might be more likely to stick to the walls of the vacuum chamber. So the effective pressure decreases because some particles are lost from the gas phase. So the number density decreases, which would increase the mean free path.

Wait, but in the problem statement, Mike found that the mean free path was no longer λ1 but λ2. So if ionization causes the effective number of gas particles to decrease, the mean free path λ would increase. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

But wait, the options include A) λ2 >= 1.22λ1, C) λ2 < λ1, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the ions have a shorter mean free path because they can interact with the electric fields in the electron beam, causing them to collide more frequently. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the mean free path for electrons is different from that of the gas molecules. But the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path.

Wait, another angle: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are being bombarded by electrons, causing them to move. The gas molecules might be accelerated by the beam, causing them to move faster, increasing their mean free path. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam introduces a current, and the gas becomes a conductor, altering the mean free path. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to become a plasma. In a plasma, the mean free path can be longer because the ions are more massive and might have lower collision rates. Or perhaps the plasma has a different behavior.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the beam increases the temperature locally, but the problem says the sample compartment's temperature remained the same. So that's not it.

Hmm, perhaps the key is that when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are being ionized, which increases the effective charge. Now, charged particles are more likely to interact with the walls of the vacuum chamber because of electrostatic attraction or repulsion. So the ions would stick to the walls, effectively reducing the number of gas particles in the compartment.

If the number density of the gas decreases (because some ions are stuck on the walls), then the mean free path λ would increase. Because λ is inversely proportional to the number density. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

But the options don't have an option where λ2 > λ1, except option A (λ2 >= 1.22 λ1) and D (λ2 between λ1 and 1.22 λ1). Wait, let me check the options again.

Wait the options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1

Hmm. So if λ2 is larger than λ1, then the only options that could be correct are A and D. But earlier I thought that it's possible for λ2 to be longer than λ1, but the question says that upon initiating the beam, the mean free path is now λ2, not λ1.

So, if the presence of the beam increases the mean free path, then λ2 would be larger than λ1. So options A or D.

But why would it be exactly 1.22 times? Where does that number come from?

Wait, 1.22 is approximately sqrt(2/pi), which is about 0.797, but wait, 1.22 is about 1/(sqrt(2/pi)) which is around 1.25, but that's close. Maybe that's a factor related to the collision integral or something else in the mean free path formula.

Alternatively, perhaps when the gas becomes ionized, the effective cross-section for collisions changes. The mean free path formula is λ = 1/(n * σ * sqrt(2)), where σ is the collision cross-section. If the gas becomes ionized, perhaps the effective cross-section increases, which would decrease λ. But if the cross-section decreases, λ would increase.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

In a perfect vacuum with no electric fields, the mean free path is determined by the gas's pressure, temperature, and molecular size. When the electron beam is on, the gas may ionize, leading to charged particles. These charged particles (ions) might have a different effective diameter, but I don't think that's the main factor here.

Alternatively, the ions might interact with the electron beam, which is a high-energy beam. But how does that affect the mean free path of the gas molecules?

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes a change in the way the gas molecules move. For example, the beam could exert a force on the ions, causing them to move in a way that affects their mean free path. But I'm not certain about the specifics.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more likely to collide with other structures in the microscope, like the walls or the sample. If the ions are attracted to the walls, they would hit the walls more often, which would reduce their mean free path.

Wait, that makes sense. If the ions are more likely to collide with the walls because they're charged, then the mean free path would decrease. Because the ions stick to the walls more, effectively, the number of gas particles in the compartment is lower. Wait, no, the number would be the same because the ions are still in the compartment but stuck on the walls.

Wait, no. If they stick to the walls, the number of gas particles in the vapor phase decreases, which would increase the mean free path because the density is lower. So that would lead to a higher mean free path, meaning λ2 is larger.

But that contradicts what I thought earlier. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. The mean free path is inversely proportional to the pressure. So if the pressure remains the same, λ should remain the same. But in this case, the pressure is the same, but the mean free path changes. So why? Because when the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas is ionized, and the ionized gas behaves differently.

Wait, perhaps the ionized gas has a lower effective pressure. Because the ions might stick to the walls. So the effective pressure would decrease, leading to a higher mean free path. So λ2 would be greater than λ1. So option A or D.

But which one? The question says that the mean free path changed, but the options don't all allow for that. Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path becomes shorter.

Wait, perhaps when the beam is on, the gas molecules are more likely to interact with the electron beam, causing more frequent collisions, thus a shorter mean free path. But why would that be?

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam introduces additional scattering mechanisms. For example, the gas molecules could be scattering off the electrons in the beam. So now, the mean free path accounts for collisions between gas molecules and the electrons in the beam as well as collisions between gas molecules themselves.

In that case, the effective cross-section (for collisions) would be larger because the gas molecules are colliding not just with each other but also with the electrons. So the mean free path would be shorter because they collide more often.

But wait, the mean free path is about collisions between gas molecules. Or does it include collisions with other particles, like the electron beam?

Wait, the question says Mike observed that the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. So perhaps the presence of the beam affects the scattering, leading to a shorter mean free path.

Wait, maybe the gas molecules, when hit by the electron beam, become excited or ionized, causing them to have more interactions. So the mean free path for the gas molecules (or the electrons) would be shorter because they collide more.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam provides a pathway for the gas molecules to move, effectively increasing their speed, thus increasing their mean free path.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about what the mean free path represents. It's the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. So if the gas density is the same, and temperature is same, the mean free path should be same. But in this scenario, the presence of the electron beam changes something else.

Wait, another angle: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might have a higher velocity because they are bombarded by the electrons. So their speed increases, leading to a longer mean free path. But since the temperature is same, the thermal velocity of the gas molecules isn't changing. Unless the beam is providing energy, but the temperature is same, so that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the beam is causing the gas to expand, effectively lowering the pressure, which would increase the mean free path. But the problem states that the sample compartment's pressure is the same because the vacuum pumps are maintaining it.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas molecules to ionize, and the ions have a different mean free path. For example, ions might have a longer mean free path because they're heavier and collide less frequently. So if the gas is more ionized, the mean free path would be longer. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

But in that case, why would the mean free path increase? Because the ions are heavier, collisions are less frequent, so the mean free path increases.

Wait, but when a gas becomes partially ionized, the number of neutral molecules decreases, and the number of ions increases. Ions have a longer mean free path because they're bigger and because they don't collide as often. So the overall mean free path would increase. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

So looking at the options, option A says λ2 is >= 1.22 * λ1. So if λ2 is bigger, option A or D is possible.

But I'm not sure why it would be exactly 1.22 times. Maybe because in the presence of the beam, the effective cross-section changes, perhaps due to ionization.

Wait, perhaps the mean free path for the ions is longer. So the overall λ2 would be longer than λ1.

So if that's the case, then λ2 is greater than λ1. So the options that have λ2 > λ1 are A and D. But the question says that upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path is no longer λ1 but λ2. So the correct conclusion is that the mean free path increased, so λ2 > λ1.

But looking at the options, option A is >=1.22 λ1, and option D is between λ1 and 1.22 λ1. So which is it?

Wait, perhaps the factor is that the mean free path for the ions is only a certain multiple of λ1. If the gas is a mix of neutral and ionized particles, the mean free path could change.

But without knowing the exact factors, perhaps the best conclusion is that λ2 is longer than λ1, so the answer would be either A or D.

Wait, wait. Another thought: the presence of the electron beam might cause the gas to become more ionized, which could cause the ions to have a longer mean free path because they're heavier. But the neutral molecules' mean free path is the same as before. So the overall mean free path of the system would be a combination of the neutral and ion contributions.

Alternatively, perhaps the ionization causes the gas to behave more like a conductor, but I'm not sure how that affects the mean free path.

Wait, perhaps the mean free path is calculated using the same formula, but with a different effective pressure if the gas has changed. But wait, the pressure hasn't changed. So λ should remain same. But according to Mike's observation, it's different.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the key point is that when the electron beam is on, the gas becomes ionized, which changes the effective pressure—perhaps not in terms of actual pressure but in terms of the behavior of the gas.

Wait, another approach: the mean free path of the electrons in the beam would be different than that of the gas molecules, but the question is about the gas's mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam causes the gas to expand, but the pressure is kept constant by the vacuum pumps, so the mean free path would increase. But no, the problem says the compartment's vacuum state remains under 1e-9 Torr.

Wait, perhaps when the electron beam is on, gas particles are being knocked out of the compartment, reducing the effective number, which increases the mean free path. But that's similar to what I thought earlier—so λ2 would be bigger than λ1.

So if λ2 is larger than λ1, which options are available?

Options A and D.

But the question says that upon initiating the beam, the mean free path is now λ2. So in that case, λ2 must be greater than λ1. So the answer would be either A or D.

But the options say A is λ2 >= 1.22 λ1, and D is λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 λ1.

So without knowing the exact factor, perhaps the answer is A.

Wait, but why 1.22? Oh, that's the factor for the mean free path when considering the collision integral. The mean free path formula is λ = 1/(n σ sqrt(2)), where σ is the collision cross-section. So if the presence of the electron beam changes σ, perhaps due to ionization, the mean free path changes by a factor of 1.22.

But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps when the gas becomes ionized, the cross-section for collisions increases, which reduces the mean free path. Because σ is in the denominator, so if σ increases, λ decreases.

Wait, if gas is ionized, maybe the cross-section increases because ions are bigger or have more charge. So higher σ leads to lower λ. So λ2 would be less than λ1. That would mean option C.

But earlier I thought that ionization would lead to a longer mean free path. So I'm getting conflicting ideas here.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas molecules to have a shorter mean free path because the electrons cause them to move more, increasing the frequency of collisions.

Wait, but if the gas molecules are moving faster, their mean free path would be longer. So that's conflicting.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to summarize:

- Vacuum state is same, so pressure same.

- Temperature same.

- When beam on, gas becomes ionized.

- Does ionization make the mean free path longer or shorter?

I think in a plasma, the mean free path can be longer because the ions are heavier and less frequent collisions. So λ increases.

But I'm not 100% sure.

If λ increases, then λ2 > λ1. So options A or D.

But the problem states that Mike accurately determined λ1 based on sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. Then, when the beam is on, the mean free path is λ2, which is different.

So, perhaps the correct answer is C) λ2 < λ1.

Wait, no, when he turns on the beam, the gas becomes ionized, and the ions' mean free path is longer. But if the number of ions is small, perhaps the overall effect is that the mean free path is longer.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam introduces a significant source of scattering, effectively increasing the effective pressure, which would decrease the mean free path. So λ2 < λ1.

Wait, but the actual pressure hasn't changed. So how could the effective pressure increase?

Maybe because the electrons are causing the gas molecules to collide more frequently, perhaps with the electrons or the walls.

Wait, but the mean free path is about gas-gas collisions. If the beam introduces more gas-wall collisions, that would decrease the mean free path.

Ah, because when the gas molecules are ionized, they stick more to the walls. So the effective number of gas particles in the compartment is lower, because some are stuck on the walls. So the density n decreases. Since λ = 1/(n σ sqrt(2)), lower n would lead to higher λ.

So if n decreases, λ increases. So λ2 > λ1.

So in that case, the correct answer would be either A or D.

But without knowing the exact factor, perhaps the answer is C) λ2 < λ1, but that's conflicting with the earlier reasoning.

Wait, perhaps another angle: the presence of the electron beam causes gas molecules to be more likely to collide with each other because the beam provides energy. But that would increase the collision rate, leading to a shorter mean free path.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct reasoning is that when the gas is ionized, the ions have a longer mean free path because they're heavier, but the overall effect depends on the dominant species.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas molecules, upon ionization, have a shorter mean free path because they're more likely to interact with the walls or the beam.

Wait, I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about what the question says: when the electron beam is on, the mean free path changes. The question is, does λ2 become larger or smaller than λ1?

In the case of a charged gas (plasma), the mean free path can be longer because ions are less likely to collide. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

But the options don't have a 'greater than' option except A and D.

Wait, the options are:

A) λ2 >=1.22 λ1

B) λ2=λ1 (so discrepancy)

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 <1.22 λ1

So, if λ2 increases beyond λ1 but not reaching 1.22 λ1, then D would be correct. But if it's beyond 1.22, A would be correct.

But I'm not sure why 1.22 is the cutoff. Maybe it's a specific factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam causes the gas pressure to effectively increase, which would decrease the mean free path. But the question says the pressure is the same, so that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the beam increases the effective pressure due to the scattering of electrons with the gas. But I'm not certain.

I'm going to have to make an educated guess here. I think that when the electron beam is on, the gas becomes ionized, which leads to a longer mean free path because the ions have less frequent collisions. So λ2 > λ1, which would make the answer either A or D.

But without more information, I'm not certain whether it's greater than 1.22 times or between λ1 and 1.22 λ1.

Wait, perhaps the mean free path of the ions is about 1.22 times longer than the neutral molecules. So the overall λ2 would be around that. So the answer would be D.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path increases by a factor of 1.22, hence option A.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the presence of the beam causes the gas to have a higher effective pressure, making the mean free path shorter. But that would be option C.

This is getting too confusing. I think the correct answer is C) λ2 < λ1 because when the beam is on, the gas molecules are more likely to interact with the beam or the walls, leading to more frequent collisions and a shorter mean free path.

But earlier reasoning suggested the opposite. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the electron beam provides a pathway for the gas to escape. So the effective pressure in the compartment decreases, which would increase the mean free path. So λ2 increases.

But the question says that the vacuum pumps are active, so the pressure remains the same. So perhaps the mean free path remains same, which is option B. But Mike observed a change, so B is incorrect.

So, back to considering that ionization increases the mean free path.

Thus, the correct answer would be A or D.

But since the question says that the mean free path is now λ2, and it's different, I think the answer is C) λ2 < λ1 because when the beam is on, the gas is more dense in the sense of interactions, leading to shorter mean free path.

Wait, I'm getting myself tied in knots. I think I'll have to go with the initial intuition that the presence of the beam ionizes the gas, leading to a longer mean free path.

So, λ2 > λ1, so options A or D.

But without knowing the exact factor, perhaps the answer is C) λ2 < λ1, because the beam causes increased scattering.

I think I'll have to make a best guess. Given the options, I'm going to say that the mean free path decreases, so the answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves analyzing the change in the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in a high-resolution transmission electron microscope when the electron beam is initiated. Initially, Mike determines the mean free path as λ1 under ultra-high vacuum conditions. However, upon turning on the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ2. The key task is to determine the relationship between λ2 and λ1 based on the described scenario.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup**: The vacuum state is maintained at ultra-high pressure (<10⁻⁹ Torr), and the temperature remains constant. The mean free path λ1 is calculated based on these conditions.

2. **Effect of the Electron Beam**: When the electron beam is turned on, the gas molecules may become ionized. Ionized particles (ions) behave differently from neutral molecules:
   - **Ionization and Wall Adhesion**: Ionized molecules are more likely to interact with the walls of the vacuum chamber due to electrostatic forces, effectively reducing the number of gas particles in the vapor phase. This reduction in effective density would increase the mean free path (λ2 > λ1).
   - **Collision Dynamics**: Ions are heavier and may collide less frequently than neutral molecules, further contributing to a longer mean free path.

3. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A (λ2 ≥ 1.22λ1)**: This suggests a significant increase in the mean free path. While ionization could increase λ2, there is no specific justification for the exact factor of 1.22 in this context.
   - **Option B (λ2 = λ1)**: This implies no change in the mean free path, which contradicts Mike's observation of a change in λ.
   - **Option C (λ2 < λ1)**: This suggests a shorter mean free path, which would occur if the electron beam caused increased scattering or collisions. However, ionization typically leads to a longer mean free path due to reduced density and less frequent collisions.
   - **Option D (λ1 < λ2 < 1.22λ1)**: This suggests a moderate increase in the mean free path. While plausible, it does not align with the reasoning that ionization could lead to a more substantial increase in λ2.

4. **Conclusion**: The presence of the electron beam likely ionizes the gas molecules, reducing their effective density and increasing the mean free path. This reasoning supports λ2 > λ1. However, without specific data on the exact factor, the most reasonable interpretation is that λ2 increases but not necessarily beyond 1.22λ1.

ANSWER: C
