Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with enthalpy calculations, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. The volumes and concentrations are given for each solution. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions typically involve an acid reacting with a base to produce water and a salt. The enthalpy change for such reactions is usually exothermic, so the sign will probably be negative.

First, I should figure out the moles of each acid and base involved. Because when you mix them, the acid and base will neutralize each other. But wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. HCl is also a strong acid. So, all of these are strong, so they should completely dissociate.

Now, the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2: H2SO4 is diprotic, meaning it can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2, I think, is a strong base and gives two OH- ions per formula unit. So when they react, the neutralization should produce water and a sulfate salt with barium.

Wait, the general reaction should be: H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2H2O. Or maybe the balanced equation is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2H2O. Let me check that. Yes, the balanced equation is 1:1 ratio because H2SO4 gives 2 H+ and Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so combining gives 2 H2O.

But wait, I have three solutions here: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. So how do they all react together? Hmm, perhaps the HCl and H2SO4 will react with the Ba(OH)2. Because both are acids, but HCl is monoprotic and H2SO4 is diprotic.

Wait, but the problem is when you mix them all together. So I need to calculate the total moles of H+ from the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base, and see which one is in excess, if any.

So first, let's compute the moles of each substance.

For HCl: volume is 500 mL (which is 0.5 L) and concentration is 0.2 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume (L). So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives one H+. So moles of H+ from HCl = 0.1.

Next, H2SO4: volume is 300 mL (0.3 L), concentration 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+ ions, so total H+ is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, Ba(OH)2: volume is 200 mL (0.2 L), concentration 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. So OH- moles = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Now, the total H+ from acids is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

The OH- from the base is 0.2 moles.

Wait, but neutralization requires H+ + OH- → H2O. So the available H+ is 0.28, and OH- is 0.2. So which is in excess?

Total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So H+ is more by 0.08 moles. So all the OH- will react, using up 0.2 moles of H+, leaving 0.08 moles of H+ unreacted.

Wait, but wait. Hmm, I think I need to think about how the neutralization works. Because the strong base Ba(OH)2 will first react with the stronger acid, perhaps H2SO4, which is a diprotic strong acid. Then any remaining OH- would react with HCl.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of net H+ and OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

First, H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 react. Since H2SO4 is diprotic, each mole gives 2 H+. Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- per mole. So the 0.09 moles H2SO4 can donate 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2 has 0.2 moles OH-.

So when H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 react, the neutralization would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

The mole ratio is 1:1. So 0.09 moles H2SO4 can neutralize 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2, producing 0.09 moles BaSO4 and 0.18 moles H2O.

But Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 moles. So after reacting with 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, there's 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 moles of Ba(OH)2 left. Wait, no, wait. No, because in the reaction, each mole of H2SO4 neutralizes one mole of Ba(OH)2. So 0.09 H2SO4 neutralizes 0.09 Ba(OH)2. That leaves 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 moles of Ba(OH)2 unreacted. Hmm, but wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it can accept H+ in two steps. Wait, but H2SO4 is diprotic, so perhaps the first H+ is neutralized first, then the second.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me approach it differently.

The total H+ from both acids: 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 moles.

So the neutralization would be H+ + OH- → H2O. So the limiting reagent is OH- (0.2 moles).

So the reaction would consume 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles OH- to produce 0.2 moles H2O.

So the moles of H+ remaining after reaction: 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08.

So the total reaction would produce 0.2 moles of H2O, and leave 0.08 moles of H+ (from HCl and H2SO4), which would not be neutralized.

Wait, but neutralization usually refers to the reaction between acids and bases. So perhaps the problem is to find the enthalpy change for the entire neutralization process, considering all the H+ and OH- reacting.

But in this case, the OH- is 0.2 moles, and H+ is 0.28. So 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- will react, producing 0.2 moles H2O. The rest of the H+ (0.08 moles) remains, but since it's in excess, perhaps it's just part of the solution and doesn't contribute to further neutralization.

Wait, but the question is about the enthalpy of neutralization when these are mixed. So the neutralization would proceed until either the acid or the base is exhausted, whichever is in lesser quantity. So in this case, the OH- is 0.2 moles, H+ is 0.28. So all the OH- will react, and some H+ will remain.

Now, the enthalpy of neutralization (ΔH) is usually calculated per mole of H+ neutralized. The standard value is about -57 kJ/mol (or sometimes -55.8, but that's close enough) for strong acid-strong base neutralization. But wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, and when it's a strong acid, the enthalpy per mole of H+ is a bit different.

Wait, wait. For strong acids and strong bases, each mole of H+ neutralized releases about 57 kJ. But H2SO4 is a diprotic strong acid, so its first dissociation is complete, but the second (HSO4^- → SO4^2- + H+) is also strong, but I think the enthalpy per H+ is about the same as for other strong acids.

But wait, when you have H2SO4, the first H+ is as strong as HCl, but the second H+ is weaker, but still considered a strong acid. So for each mole of H2SO4, you get two H+ ions, each reacting with OH- to form water, each releasing around 57 kJ.

So the total enthalpy change would be the sum of all H+ neutralized multiplied by the enthalpy per mole.

But wait, in this problem, the H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4, and the OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

The reaction is: H+ (from acids) + OH- → H2O. So for each mole of H+ and OH- that react, the enthalpy change is -57 kJ (assuming it's exothermic).

So in this case, the amount of H+ neutralized is 0.2 moles (since OH- is 0.2 moles and it's the limiting reagent). So the total enthalpy change is 0.2 moles × (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, and option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, the units are mixed here. Because some options are in kcal and some in kJ.

Wait, the problem says "Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization", but the options are a mix of kcal and kJ. That's confusing. Let me make sure.

The options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Hmm, so the question is expecting either kcal or kJ as the answer. But I think that the standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually given in kJ/mol. But looking at the options, B is in kcal and D is in kJ.

Wait, wait, but I just calculated 0.2 moles × (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ. But option D is -16.0 kJ. So that's not matching. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the neutralization of all H+ from all acids, but that's not possible since OH- is only 0.2 moles.

Wait, but maybe I should consider the stoichiometry correctly. Let me re-examine the moles.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles.

H+ from H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH- → 0.2 moles.

So the H+ + OH- → H2O will be 0.2 moles of each, producing 0.2 moles H2O. So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmmm. So perhaps my assumption about the enthalpy per mole is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I'm forgetting that H2SO4 is diprotic, and each mole contributes two H+; perhaps each H+ contributes half the enthalpy? No, that doesn't make sense because each H+ is neutralized by OH-.

Wait another approach: the neutralization of 1 mole of H+ gives off 57 kJ. So for 0.2 moles, it's 0.2 × 57 = 11.4 kJ, but since it's exothermic, it's -11.4 kJ.

So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ. But none of the options exactly match that. Option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the moles calculation. Let me double-check.

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L. 0.2 M → 0.2 *0.5=0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL =0.3 L. 0.3 M → 0.3 *0.3 = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL=0.2 L. 0.5 M →0.5 *0.2=0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 OH-.

So yes, the H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So H+ in excess is 0.08.

So the neutralization reaction uses 0.2 moles of H+ and OH-.

So calculation for enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But none of the options have -11.4 kJ. Wait, the options are A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

So 11.4 kJ is approximately 11.4 × 1 kJ. Which isn't exactly any of the options, but option D is -16.0 kJ, which is much larger.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong enthalpy value. Maybe the enthalpy per mole of reaction is different.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction includes the neutralization of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 first, then the remaining H+ from HCl.

Wait, H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole gives two H+. Ba(OH)2 is diprotic as well, giving two OH- per mole. So the reaction is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So moles of H2SO4: 0.09, Ba(OH)2: 0.1.

So H2SO4 is the limiting reagent here. So 0.09 moles of H2SO4 will react with 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, producing 0.09 moles of BaSO4 and 0.18 moles of H2O.

After that, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 moles. Which gives 0.02 moles of OH-.

Then, the HCl (0.1 moles H+) and any remaining OH- (0.02) will react.

So H+ from HCl is 0.1. OH- is 0.02.

So 0.02 moles of H+ and OH- will react, producing 0.02 moles H2O.

The remaining H+ is 0.1 - 0.02 = 0.08.

So the total moles of H2O produced from both reactions: 0.18 (from H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2) + 0.02 (from HCl and Ba(OH)2) = 0.20 moles.

So total neutralization is 0.20 moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait, but H2SO4 contributes two H+ per mole, so each mole produces two H+.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy should be calculated based on the moles of H+ neutralized.

So how many H+ are neutralized in total?

In the first reaction, 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 H+.

In the second reaction, 0.02 moles H+.

Total H+ neutralized: 0.20 moles.

So the total enthalpy change is 0.20 mol × (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

So again, -11.4 kJ. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the enthalpy per mole of each acid and base, but perhaps each H2SO4 contributes two equivalents. So maybe the calculation should sum up the equivalents for each acid and base and find the neutralization.

Let me think in terms of equivalents.

Equivalents of H+ from HCl: 0.1 mol × 1 = 0.1 eq.

From H2SO4: 0.09 mol × 2 = 0.18 eq.

Total H+ equivalents: 0.28 eq.

Equivalents of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol × 2 = 0.2 eq.

So, the neutralization is 0.2 eq H+ and OH- → 0.2 eq H2O.

So the same as before, 0.2 moles.

Hmm. So the same calculation as before.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that for H2SO4, the second H+ is weaker, so the enthalpy per mole is different. But I thought both H+ from H2SO4 are strong. Wait, no. The first dissociation of H2SO4 is strong, but the second (HSO4^- → SO4^2- + H+) is weak, but in aqueous solution, it's considered a strong acid because it's fully deprotonated. Hmm, but for the purpose of enthalpy calculation, maybe the first H+ has a higher enthalpy change than the second.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization for the first H+ is about -57 kJ/mol, and the second H+ is around -50 kJ/mol or something like that. So maybe for H2SO4, the first H+ gives off 57 kJ, and the second gives off less.

If that's the case, then the total enthalpy would be (0.09 mol H2SO4 × 2) × enthalpy per H+. But if each H+ has different ΔH.

Wait, maybe I should look for the standard enthalpy of neutralization for H2SO4. From what I remember, the first H+ is about -57 kJ/mol, and the second is about -50 or -55 kJ/mol. Let's say approximately -50 kJ/mol.

So, the neutralization of H+ from H2SO4 would be:

First H+ (0.18 mol from H2SO4) × (-57 kJ/mol) = -10.26 kJ.

Second H+ (0.18 mol) × (-50 kJ/mol) = -9 kJ.

Wait, but wait, no. Because in the reaction, all H+ from H2SO4 (0.18) are available, but the OH- is 0.2 mol. So only 0.2 mol of H+ will react. So which H+ reacts first?

The strong acid H+ (like from HCl and H2SO4's first H+) will react first. So the H+ from HCl (0.1 mol) and the first H+ from H2SO4 (0.09 × 2 = 0.18 mol) are all strong. So the total H+ available is 0.28.

But the OH- is 0.2 mol.

So the neutralization will use 0.2 mol of H+, which can come from any source.

But perhaps the strongest H+ (from HCl and H2SO4) will react first.

Wait, but HCl is a stronger acid than H2SO4's second H+.

Hmm, perhaps the H+ comes from HCl (strongest) and then H2SO4's first H+.

Wait, but in any case, it's perhaps easier to assume that each H+ contributes about the same amount, so 0.2 × 57 = 11.4 kJ. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy is given as per mole of acid or per mole of base.

Wait, another approach: maybe the problem is asking for the total enthalpy change from the mixing, which includes all the neutralizations.

But if the neutralization is 0.2 moles of H+/OH-, then 0.2 × 57 = 11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. So that's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, and each mole contributes two H+, but the first H+ has a larger enthalpy change than the second. So maybe the first 0.2 moles of H+ have higher enthalpy.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about another approach. Maybe calculate the total equivalents of acid and base and see which is in excess.

Equivalents of H+ = 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28 eq.

Equivalents of OH- = 0.2 eq.

So, the neutralization will go to 0.2 eq. The excess is 0.08 eq of H+.

So the total enthalpy is 0.2 × (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy per mole of H2O formed as -57 kJ per mole. So for 0.2 moles, it's -11.4 kJ. So why isn't this an option?

Looking again at the options:

Option B is -11.42 kcal. Oh, because they converted kJ to kcal.

Wait, wait, 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So 57 kJ is about 57 / 4.184 ≈ 13.616 kcal.

So if 0.2 moles × 57 kJ/mol = 11.4 kJ, which is 11.4 / 4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy would be -2.72 kcal. Which is option A.

But earlier I thought the enthalpy per mole of H+ is 57 kJ/mol. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, wait a second. I think I made a mistake. Because the enthalpy of neutralization is often given as per mole of reaction, which for H+ and OH- → H2O is -57 kJ per mole of H2O, but wait, the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and that releases about 57 kJ per mole of H2O.

So for 0.2 moles, it's 0.2 × (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But if the options are in kcal, let me convert that to kcal.

11.4 kJ * (1 kcal / 4.184 kJ) ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the total H+ neutralized is 0.2 moles. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ or about -2.72 kcal.

So option A is -2.72 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ.

But wait, I'm getting conflicting possibilities here. Because the calculation for -11.4 kJ (option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately -11.4 kJ converted to kcal). Wait, no, if 11.4 kJ is 2.72 kcal, then 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between per mole of H+ and per mole of H2O. Because each mole of H2O corresponds to one mole of H+ neutralized.

Wait, let me think again. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So each mole of H+ neutralized produces one mole of H2O, releasing 57 kJ. So for 0.2 moles, it's 0.2 × 57 = 11.4 kJ.

But if the problem is asking for the answer in kcal, then 11.4 kJ is about 11.4 / 4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the answer would be -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, the options don't have this for exactly 0.2 moles. Let me calculate it precisely.

0.2 moles × 57,000 J/mol = 11,400 J. Which is 11.4 kJ.

Converting to kcal: 11,400 J ÷ 4184 J/kcal ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But earlier I thought that the moles of H+ neutralized are 0.2, so why does option B say -11.42 kcal, which is close to 11.4 kJ?

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think: 11.4 kJ is 11,400 J. Converting to kcal: 11,400 / 4184 = approximately 2.72 kcal, so -2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer would be option A.

But wait, perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization of all the H+ and OH- in the solution, including any excess. No, because OH- is the limiting reagent, so only 0.2 moles react.

I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the answer would be -11.4 kJ, but the options don't have that. However, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is 16,000 J.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles.

Wait, HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 mol → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 mol → 0.2 OH-.

So the neutralization is 0.2 moles H+ and OH-.

So the calculation is 0.2 × 57 = 11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't considering the enthalpy per mole of H+ but per mole of H2O.

Wait, each mole of H2O is formed from one mole of H+ and one OH-, releasing 57 kJ. So for 0.2 moles H2O, it's 0.2 × 57 = 11.4 kJ.

But again, this doesn't match any of the options except perhaps option B if it's in kJ. But option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about the same as -11.4 kJ converted to kcal.

Wait, no. 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal, but 11.42 kcal is about 48.3 kJ. So option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 48.3 kJ. But our calculation is 11.4 kJ, which is 2.72 kcal.

So if the question expects the answer in kcal, then option A is correct. But if it's in kJ, then none of the options match.

Wait, but the options also have D as -16.0 kJ. Hmmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the stoichiometry when considering H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

Wait, because Ba(OH)2 has two OH- per formula unit, and H2SO4 has two H+.

So when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2, the reaction is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So each mole of H2SO4 neutralizes one mole of Ba(OH)2, producing two moles of H2O.

So, moles of H2SO4: 0.09.

Moles of Ba(OH)2:0.1.

So H2SO4 is limiting, and after reaction, 0.09 moles H2SO4 and 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2 are consumed, leaving 0.01 moles Ba(OH)2.

Now, the H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles. The remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.01 moles → 0.02 moles OH-.

So the remaining OH- will react with HCl's H+.

So the total moles of H+ neutralized are 0.09 × 2 (from H2SO4) + 0.02 (from HCl).

Wait, no. Let me think again.

The H2SO4 provides 0.18 H+ (0.09 × 2), which reacts with 0.09 × 2 OH- from Ba(OH)2 → 0.18 moles OH-.

Wait, no, each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-.

So when 0.09 moles H2SO4 react with 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2, the OH- consumed is 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 moles, giving 0.2 OH-.

So after reacting 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2 with H2SO4, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 -0.09=0.01 moles, which gives 0.02 OH-.

Now, the H+ available is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28. But when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2, the H+ from H2SO4 is consumed in the reaction.

Wait, no, the H+ from H2SO4 is released into solution, regardless of whether it reacts with OH-.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let's think in terms of equivalents.

The total H+ available is 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28 eq.

The OH- available is 0.2 eq.

So, the neutralization uses 0.2 eq, leaving 0.08 eq of H+.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have that, so perhaps I should look again.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ, but option D is -16.0 kJ. How did we get that?

Wait, 0.2 moles × 80 kJ/mol =16 kJ. But why 80 kJ?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recalculate the moles.

Wait, wait, HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L, 0.2 M → 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles.

H2SO4: 300 mL=0.3 L, 0.3 M →0.3 *0.3=0.09 moles. Each gives 2 H+ → 0.18.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL=0.2 L, 0.5 M →0.5 *0.2=0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH- →0.2.

So H+ total=0.28, OH- total=0.2.

So neutralization is 0.2 × (-57) =-11.4 kJ.

So the answer must be -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 kJ ≈ 2.72 kcal).

But looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but why is option D -16.0 kJ? Maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering each mole of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 as contributing two equivalents each, leading to a higher total.

Wait, another approach: find the total equivalents of acid and base.

HCl: 0.1 mol → 0.1 eq.

H2SO4: 0.09 mol → 0.18 eq.

Total acid equivalents: 0.28.

Base equivalents: Ba(OH)2 → 0.1 mol → 0.2 eq.

So neutralization is min(0.28, 0.2) =0.2 eq.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57) =-11.4 kJ.

So the correct answer is -11.4 kJ, but since none of the options have this, and option A is -2.72 kcal, which is approximately 11.4 kJ in kcal, that's the right choice.

So the answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from acids**:
   - **HCl**:  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since HCl is monoprotic, moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **H₂SO₄**:  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since H₂SO₄ is diprotic, moles of H⁺ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **Total H⁺ from acids**:  
     \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:
   - Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since Ba(OH)₂ is diprotic, moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Determine the limiting reagent**:
   - The reaction \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \) requires 1 mole of H⁺ and 1 mole of OH⁻.  
   - Total H⁺ available = \( 0.28 \, \text{mol} \), and total OH⁻ available = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, as it is present in smaller quantity.

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change**:
   - The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) per mole of H⁺ neutralized.  
   - Moles of H⁺ neutralized = moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Enthalpy change = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

5. **Convert to kcal if necessary**:
   - \( 1 \, \text{kJ} = 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \).  
   - \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \times 0.239 = -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

6. **Analyze the options**:
   - **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**: Matches the calculated value when converted to kcal.  
   - **Option B (-11.42 kcal)**: Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value.  
   - **Option C (-3.80 kcal)**: Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value.  
   - **Option D (-16.0 kJ)**: Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value in kJ.

The correct answer is **-2.72 kcal**, which corresponds to **Option A**.
