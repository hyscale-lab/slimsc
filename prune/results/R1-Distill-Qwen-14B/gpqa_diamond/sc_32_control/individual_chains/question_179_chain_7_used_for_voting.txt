Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. It's about matrices and some properties they might have. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question presents four matrices: W, X, Y, and Z. Each is a 3x3 matrix. The options are statements about these matrices, and I need to pick the correct one.

Let me first list the matrices as given:

W:
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

X:
i  -1  2i
1   0   1
2i -1  -i

Y:
0.5 0.1 0.2
0.1 0.25 0.1
0.2 0.1 0.25

Z:
3    2i    5
-2i  -2   -4i
5   4i    4

The options are A, B, C, D. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the evolution operator (like e^{-iHt/ħ}) must be unitary. Unitary matrices preserve the norm of vectors because their conjugate transpose is their inverse. So if e^X is not unitary, multiplying by it would change the vector's norm.

Wait, but what about the properties of matrix exponentials? For e^A to be unitary, A must be skew-Hermitian (i.e., A† = -A). So let's check if X is skew-Hermitian.

Skew-Hermitian means X† = -X.

Compute X†:
The conjugate transpose of X.

Original X:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

X† will have the columns as rows, each element conjugated.

So X†:
Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: 2i, -1, i

Wait, let me compute each element. Let's see, the (1,1) element of X is i, so (1,1) in X† is i*. i* is -i.

Similarly, (1,2) of X is -1, so (2,1) of X† is -1.

(1,3) of X is 2i, so (3,1) of X† is -2i. Wait, because conjugation of 2i is -2i.

Wait, perhaps I should write the entire X†:

X is:

Row 1: i   -1    2i
Row 2: 1    0     1
Row 3: 2i  -1    -i

So X† is the conjugate transpose:

Each element (i,j) becomes (j,i)*.

So:

X†:
Column 1 of X becomes row 1 of X†, conjugated.

Original column 1:
i
1
2i

Conjugate each:
-i
1
-2i

So row 1 of X†: -i, 1, -2i

Column 2 of X:
-1, 0, -1

Conjugate: -1, 0, -1

So row 2 of X†: -1, 0, -1

Column 3 of X:
2i, 1, -i

Conjugate: -2i, 1, i

So row 3 of X† is -2i, 1, i.

Wait wait, let me correct that: Column 3 of X is 2i, 1, -i. So conjugating each: (-2i), 1*, (-i)* → (-2i), 1, i.

So X† matrix is:

Row 1: -i   1   -2i
Row 2: -1   0   -1
Row 3: -2i  1    i

Now, let's compute -X:

-X is just negative each element of X.

X is:

Row 1: i   -1    2i
Row 2: 1    0     1
Row 3: 2i  -1    -i

So -X is:

Row 1: -i   1   -2i
Row 2: -1   0   -1
Row 3: -2i  1    i

Wait a minute! That's exactly the same as X†.

So X is skew-Hermitian because X† = -X.

Ah, right, so if X is skew-Hermitian, then e^X is unitary. Because for a skew-Hermitian matrix A (A† = -A), e^A is unitary. Because (e^A)† = e^{A†} = e^{-A} = e^A inverse. So unitary.

Therefore, e^X is unitary, meaning it preserves the norm of any vector it's multiplied by. So option A says that there exists a vector where the norm changes when multiplied by e^X. But since e^X is unitary, it's not possible. So A is false.

Option B: (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) represents a quantum state.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, operators are often represented by matrices. The expression e^X Y e^{-X} would be similar to a similarity transformation. But e^X is unitary, so e^{-X} is its inverse, (e^X)^†.

So e^X Y e^{-X} is a conjugated matrix of Y under the transformation e^X. But a quantum state is a vector, not an operator. Wait, no: wait, in quantum mechanics, the state is a vector, and operators are matrices. So if this expression is a matrix, it would be an operator, not a state.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to whether the result is a density matrix, which represents a state. But for a density matrix, it must be Hermitian, positive semi-definite, and trace 1.

But let's think: Y is given. What's Y? Let me compute Y:

Y's elements are:

Row 1: 0.5, 0.1, 0.2

Row 2: 0.1, 0.25, 0.1

Row 3: 0.2, 0.1, 0.25

It looks symmetric (0.1 in (1,2) and (2,1), etc.), so Y is Hermitian because it's real and symmetric. So Y is Hermitian.

Now, when you conjugate Y with a unitary matrix U, like e^X, then U Y U† is also Hermitian. Because (U Y U†)† = U Y† U† = U Y U†, assuming Y is Hermitian. So e^X Y e^{-X} is Hermitian.

But is it a density matrix? A density matrix must have trace 1. Let's compute the trace of Y.

Trace of Y: 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1. So trace is 1.

But what about after the similarity transform? The trace remains the same because trace is invariant under similarity transformations. So the transformed matrix still has trace 1.

But the transformed matrix is also positive semi-definite? Wait, Y is a positive semi-definite matrix because all its eigenvalues are non-negative? Looking at Y's elements, it's a symmetric matrix. Let me check if it's positive definite.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a valid density matrix. But after the conjugation, it's still a valid density matrix because similarity transforms preserve positive semi-definiteness and trace.

Wait, but the question is whether (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) represents a quantum state. A quantum state can be a pure state (a unit vector) or a mixed state (density matrix). But the expression here is an operator, a matrix, so it would represent a mixed state, i.e., a density matrix.

So if Y is a density matrix, then the transformed version would also be a density matrix, hence representing a valid quantum state. So option B is correct? Or wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Because the expression is (e^X) Y (e^{-X}), which is a similarity transform. Y is a density matrix, so after the transform, it's another density matrix, hence a valid quantum state. So option B is correct. Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me come back to this after checking other options.

Option C: Z and X represent observables.

In quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. So I need to check if Z and X are Hermitian.

First, check X. Earlier, I found that X is skew-Hermitian, so X† = -X. That implies X is not Hermitian because Hermitian matrices satisfy A = A†. So X is not Hermitian, so it can't represent an observable. Therefore, option C is incorrect because X is not Hermitian.

What about Z? Let's compute Z† and see if Z equals Z†.

Z matrix:
Row 1: 3, 2i, 5
Row 2: -2i, -2, -4i
Row 3:5,4i,4

Compute Z†:

Conjugate each element and transpose.

The conjugate of Z is:

Row 1:3, -2i,5
Row 2:2i, -2,4i
Row 3:5, -4i,4

Wait, no: actually, Z† is the conjugate transpose. So Z^dagger would be:

Rows become columns, with each element conjugated.

So:

Z is:

Row 1: 3    2i     5
Row 2: -2i  -2    -4i
Row 3:5     4i     4

So Z†:

Column 1: 3, -2i,5. Conjugate each: 3*, (-2i)* → 2i,5* →5. So first row is 3, 2i,5.

Wait, no, wait. Each element is conjugated. So:

Z†:

Row 1:3*, (-2i)*,5* → 3, 2i,5.

Row 2: 2i*, (-4i)*,4* → -2i,4i,4. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute each element.

Z is:

[3, 2i,5;

-2i, -2, -4i;

5,4i,4]

So Z† is:

[3*, (-2i)*,5*;

2i*, (-4i)*,4*;

5*,4i*,4*]

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the transpose would swap rows and columns. So the first column of Z becomes the first row of Z†, conjugated.

Column 1 of Z is [3; -2i;5]. Conjugate: [3; 2i;5].

So row 1 of Z† is 3, 2i,5.

Column 2 of Z is [2i; -2;4i]. Conjugate: (-2i), -2, (-4i).

So row 2 of Z† is (-2i), -2, (-4i).

Column 3 of Z is [5; -4i;4]. Conjugate:5,4i,4.

So row 3 of Z† is 5,4i,4.

So Z† is:

Row 1: 3, 2i,5

Row 2: -2i, -2, -4i

Row 3:5,4i,4

Wait, compare that to the original Z:

Z is:

Row 1:3, 2i,5

Row 2: -2i, -2, -4i

Row 3:5,4i,4

Wait, that's exactly the same as Z. So Z is Hermitian because Z† equals Z.

So Z is Hermitian, but X is not. So option C says Z and X are observables. But since X is not Hermitian, option C is incorrect.

Option D: W and X represent the evolution operator of some quantum system.

In quantum mechanics, the evolution operator is usually of the form e^{-iHt}, where H is Hermitian (so that the operator is unitary). The evolution operator must be unitary.

So W is given. Let me check if W is unitary. A unitary matrix U satisfies U† U = I.

Compute W† and multiply by W.

W:

Row 1:0 0 1

Row 2:0 1 0

Row 3:1 0 0

W† is the conjugate transpose. Since W is real and symmetric (because W is its own transpose; W is a permutation matrix), W† = W^T = W, because all elements are real.

So W† is same as W.

Compute W† W = W^2.

W squared:

W * W = ?

Let me compute each element.

W is:

0 0 1

0 1 0

1 0 0

Multiply W by W.

Element (1,1): (0)(0) + (0)(0) + (1)(1) = 1

(1,2): (0)(0)+(0)(1)+(1)(0) =0

(1,3): (0)(1)+(0)(0)+(1)(0)=0

So first row of W^2 is [1,0,0].

Second row:

(2,1): (0)(0)+(1)(0)+(0)(1)=0

(2,2): (0)(0)+(1)(1)+(0)(0)=1

(2,3): (0)(1)+(1)(0)+(0)(0)=0

So second row [0,1,0].

Third row:

(3,1): (1)(0)+(0)(0)+(0)(1)=0

(3,2): (1)(0)+(0)(1)+(0)(0)=0

(3,3): (1)(1)+(0)(0)+(0)(0)=1

So third row [0,0,1].

Wait, no. Wait, actually, W squared is the identity matrix.

Because when you multiply W by W, you get:

Row 1: [0 0 1] * columns.

Wait, more accurately, let's compute W^2:

W is:

Row 1:0,0,1

Row 2:0,1,0

Row 3:1,0,0

So when you multiply W * W:

The (i,j) element is the sum over k of W_ik * W_kj.

Compute (1,1): W_11*W_11 + W_12*W_21 + W_13*W_31.

W_11=0, W_12=0, W_13=1.

W_11=0 → 0*0=0

W_21=0 → 0*0=0

W_31=1 →1*1=1.

So sum is 1. So (1,1)=1.

(1,2): W_11*W_12 + W_12*W_22 + W_13*W_32.

W_12=0, W_22=1, W_32=0.

So 0 + 0*1 + 1*0 = 0.

Similarly, (1,3)=0.

Second row:

(2,1): W_21*W_11 + W_22*W_21 + W_23*W_31.

W_21=0, W_22=1, W_23=0.

So 0*0 +1*0 +0*1 =0.

(2,2): W_21*W_12 + W_22*W_22 + W_23*W_32.

0*0 +1*1 +0*0=1.

(2,3): W_21*W_13 + W_22*W_23 + W_23*W_33.

0*1 +1*0 +0*0=0.

Third row:

(3,1): W_31*W_11 + W_32*W_21 + W_33*W_31.

W_31=1, W_11=0 →1*0=0.

W_32=0, W_21=0 →0*0=0.

W_33=0, W_31=1 →0*1=0.

So (3,1)=0.

(3,2): W_31*W_12 + W_32*W_22 + W_33*W_32.

1*0 + 0*1 +0*0=0.

(3,3): W_31*W_13 + W_32*W_23 + W_33*W_33.

1*1 +0*0 +0*0=1.

So W^2 is the identity matrix:

1 0 0

0 1 0

0 0 1

So W is unitary because W† W = I.

So W is a unitary matrix.

Earlier, we saw that X is skew-Hermitian, so e^X is unitary. Wait, but option D says W and X represent the evolution operator. Evolution operators are unitary, yes. But more specifically, they usually are of the form e^{-iH} where H is Hermitian. So W would be an evolution operator only if it can be written as e^{-iH}.

But W is a permutation matrix. Let's think about its eigenvalues. The matrix W is a permutation matrix; it's a 3x3 matrix that swaps rows. Let me find its eigenvalues.

The matrix W is:

0 0 1

0 1 0

1 0 0

It's a permutation of the basis vectors. Specifically, it swaps basis vector 1 and 3, leaving 2 untouched.

The eigenvalues of a permutation matrix are on the unit circle in the complex plane. For a 3x3 matrix that swaps 1 and 3, the eigenvalues are 1 and e^{2πi/3}, e^{-2πi/3} or something like that.

But for the evolution operator, which is of the form e^{-iH t}, H being Hermitian, the eigenvalues are of the form e^{-i E t}, where E is real (since H is Hermitian, E is real). So for W to be an evolution operator, its eigenvalues must be on the unit circle and can be written in that exponential form.

But W is a real, orthogonal matrix (since W^T = W† = W^{-1}), so it can be expressed as e^{-iH} only if it's in the special unitary group. Wait, W is in O(3) (since it's orthogonal), but SU(3) requires determinant 1 and traceless. W's determinant: let's compute it.

W is a permutation matrix. The determinant is the sign of the permutation. The permutation here is (1 3), which is a transposition, so it's sign is -1. So determinant of W is -1.

The determinant of e^{-iH} is the product of e^{-i E_j}, where E_j are eigenvalues of H. Since H is Hermitian, E_j are real. So determinant of e^{-iH} would be e^{-i sum E_j}.

But if W has determinant -1, then e^{-i sum E_j} = -1. That implies that sum E_j = (2m +1) π for some integer m. So that's possible, but W itself is in O(3), not SU(3), since determinant is -1.

But the question is whether W and X can be the evolution operators. Since W is unitary, it could be an evolution operator. But X is skew-Hermitian, so e^X is unitary, so X could be part of an evolution operator construction, like e^{-X} perhaps? Wait, but X is skew-Hermitian, which makes e^X unitary, but let's think about the form.

Wait, the standard form is e^{-i H t}, where H is Hermitian. So if X is skew-Hermitian, then H = i X is Hermitian. So e^{-i H t} = e^{-i (i X) t} = e^{X t}.

So if the evolution operator is e^{X t}, then X must be skew-Hermitian. So yes, X can be part of an evolution operator.

Wait, but the option says W and X represent the evolution operator. So each of them is an evolution operator? Or perhaps they are possible evolution operators.

Wait, I think the question is whether both W and X can be evolution operators. Since W is unitary, it can be an evolution operator. Similarly, X is skew-Hermitian, so e^X is unitary. Wait, no, X itself is not the evolution operator. The evolution operator is e^{X} or e^{-X}, since X is skew-Hermitian.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

In quantum mechanics, the time evolution operator is U = e^{-i H t}, where H is Hermitian. So H must be Hermitian. So if H is Hermitian, then i H is skew-Hermitian. So e^{i H} is unitary.

Wait, let me think: let's say H is Hermitian, so H† = H. Then i H is skew-Hermitian because (i H)† = -i H† = -i H. So yes, i H is skew-Hermitian. So e^{i H} is unitary because if A is skew-Hermitian, e^A is unitary.

But the time evolution operator is usually written as e^{-i H t}, which is the same as (e^{i H})^t. So if X is skew-Hermitian, say X = i H, then e^X = e^{i H} is unitary. So e^X can be an evolution operator.

Wait, but the question is whether W and X are evolution operators. W is a 3x3 matrix. Evolution operators are unitary, and W is unitary, so W can be an evolution operator. Similarly, X is skew-Hermitian, so e^X is unitary, but X itself is not a valid evolution operator because it's not unitary (its magnitude would change). Wait, no. The evolution operator is the exponential, not X itself.

Wait, no. The matrix X is not unitary. Let me compute the norm of X. The Frobenius norm is the sum of absolute squares of elements.

Compute ||X||_F^2 = |i|^2 + |-1|^2 + |2i|^2 + |1|^2 + |0|^2 + |1|^2 + |2i|^2 + |-1|^2 + |-i|^2.

Each term:

|i|^2 =1

|-1|²=1

|2i|²=4

|1|²=1

0 →0

|1|²=1

|2i|²=4

|-1|²=1

| -i |²=1.

Adding them up: 1 +1 +4 +1 +0 +1 +4 +1 +1 = Let's compute:

1+1=2; +4=6; +1=7; +1=8; +4=12; +1=13; +1=14. So norm squared is 14, so norm is sqrt(14) ≈3.7417.

Since X is not unitary (because ||X|| is not 1), it's not a valid evolution operator. Only its exponential is.

So option D says W and X represent the evolution operator. But X isn't an evolution operator itself; only e^X would be. So W can be an evolution operator, but X cannot. So D is incorrect because both W and X are not evolution operators. So only W is.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is whether W and X represent the evolution operator. So perhaps each of them can be an evolution operator for some system.

Since W is unitary, it can be an evolution operator, yes. X is not unitary, but as a matrix, perhaps it's used in the exponent. But the question refers to whether X is an evolution operator. So I think D is incorrect because X itself is not an evolution operator.

So now, going back to the options:

A is wrong because e^X is unitary, so no vector's norm changes.

B: e^X Y e^{-X} is a density matrix, so it's a valid quantum state.

C is wrong because X is not Hermitian.

D is wrong because X is not an evolution operator.

So the correct statement is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves analyzing the properties of four given matrices (W, X, Y, Z) in the context of quantum mechanics. The goal is to determine which statement among the options A, B, C, and D is correct.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:  
The statement claims that there exists a vector to which if one multiplies \( e^X \), the norm of the vector changes. For \( e^X \) to change the norm of a vector, \( e^X \) must not be unitary. However, \( X \) is skew-Hermitian (\( X^\dagger = -X \)), and the exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix (\( e^X \)) is unitary. Unitary matrices preserve the norm of any vector they act on. Therefore, this statement is **false**.

#### **Option B**:  
The statement claims that \( (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) \) represents a quantum state. A quantum state can be represented by a density matrix, which must be Hermitian, positive semi-definite, and have trace 1. The matrix \( Y \) is real, symmetric, and has a trace of 1, making it a valid density matrix. The expression \( (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) \) is a similarity transformation by the unitary matrix \( e^X \), which preserves the Hermiticity, positive semi-definiteness, and trace of \( Y \). Thus, \( (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) \) is also a valid density matrix, representing a quantum state. This statement is **true**.

#### **Option C**:  
The statement claims that \( Z \) and \( X \) represent observables. Observables in quantum mechanics are represented by Hermitian matrices. Matrix \( X \) is skew-Hermitian (\( X^\dagger = -X \)), not Hermitian, so it cannot represent an observable. Matrix \( Z \), however, is Hermitian (\( Z^\dagger = Z \)), so it can represent an observable. Since \( X \) is not Hermitian, this statement is **false**.

#### **Option D**:  
The statement claims that \( W \) and \( X \) represent the evolution operator of some quantum system. The evolution operator in quantum mechanics is typically of the form \( e^{-iH} \), where \( H \) is Hermitian. \( W \) is a permutation matrix and is unitary (\( W^\dagger W = I \)), so it can represent an evolution operator. However, \( X \) is skew-Hermitian, and while \( e^X \) is unitary, \( X \) itself is not unitary and cannot directly represent the evolution operator. Thus, this statement is **false**.

### Conclusion:
The only correct statement is **Option B**, as \( (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) \) is a valid density matrix representing a quantum state.

**Answer: B**
