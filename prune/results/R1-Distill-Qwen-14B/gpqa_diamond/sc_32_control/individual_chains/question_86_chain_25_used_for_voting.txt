Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying the starting materials A and B for two different reactions that both produce the same product but with different configurations. The product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reactions use LiBH4 and BH3 as reducing agents, respectively.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually used for ketones, esters, etc. BH3 is more commonly used in the formation of alcohols from ketones through hydroboration-oxidation. Oh wait, but both reactions are producing a ketone. Wait, the product is a tetrahydro pyranone, which is a cyclic ketone. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I got it wrong. Let me think again. The product is a ketone, but the starting material is an ester or something else. Because LiBH4 is used to reduce esters to alcohols, but in some cases, it can also reduce ketones, but that might not be applicable here.

Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let me think about the structure of that. Pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. Tetrahydro means it's fully saturated, so it's a six-membered ring with one oxygen (like a cyclic ether) but all single bonds. 2H-pyran-2-one implies that the ketone is at position 2. So the structure is a six-membered ring with an oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

So the product is a cyclic ketone, a cyclohexenone derivative, I think. Now, how would you get that from the reactions given?

LiBH4 and BH3 are both used as reducing agents, but in different contexts. Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, commonly used to reduce carbonyl groups to alcohols. BH3 is usually used in hydroboration reactions, which add boron and hydrogen across double bonds, with anti-Markovnikov addition. Oh wait, but in this case, the product is a ketone, so maybe the starting materials are esters or other carbonyl-containing compounds.

Wait, if the product is a cyclic ketone, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones) or something else. Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are diethyl acetals or some kind of hemiacetals. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think about the reagents. So reaction A uses LiBH4 and H+, and reaction B uses BH3 and H+. What could they be reducing?

LiBH4 is often used to reduce esters to alcohols. For example, an ester group RCOOR' would be reduced to RCH2OH and R'OH. Wait, but in that case, LiBH4 would reduce the ester to an alcohol. But the product here is a ketone. Hmm, maybe the starting material is a ketone? But that would just reduce it further to an alcohol, which isn't what the product is.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an acetal or something else. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals or acetals, which upon reduction would open up to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, the product is a tetrahydropyranone, which is a cyclic ketone with five carbons from the oxygen. Oh wait, pyran is a six-membered ring. So the ring is O-C-C-C-C-C-O? No, wait, pyran is O-C-C-C-C-C with one double bond typically, but in the tetrahydro form, it's all single bonds.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are cyclic acetals. Let me think: if the starting material is an acetal, and upon reduction, it breaks to form the ketone.

Wait, acetals are formed from ketones or aldehydes and alcohols. When you reduce an acetal, what happens? Acetals are typically resistant to most reductions because they're already in a reduced form. Wait, maybe using a strong reducing agent like LiBH4 or BH3 can cleave them.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the starting materials are ketals or acetals, and when treated with a reducing agent, they undergo ring-opening to form a ketone. But I'm not entirely certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters, which upon reduction give alcohols. But that doesn't lead to a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the product is a cyclic ketone, which suggests that it's formed from a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal that's been opened. So the starting material might be a cyclic hemiacetal, which upon reduction would form the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are 5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid derivatives. Let me look at the options. The options are A and B as 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid with different configurations.

Wait, 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. That structure would have a pentanoic acid chain, with an ethyl group on carbon 3, an isobutoxy group on carbon 5, and a ketone (oxo) group on carbon 5 as well. Wait, but wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So 5-oxo would be the same as the carboxylic acid group. That can't be right. Oh maybe I miscounted.

Wait, the formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So pentanoic acid: positions are 1 (COOH), 2, 3, 4, 5. So position 5 would be the end, but wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So the 5 position would be the methyl group adjacent to COOH. Hmm, but 5-oxo would imply a carbonyl group at position 5, which is the same as the COOH. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misinterpreting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a pentanoate ester or something else. Wait, the options are all 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the substituents are at position 5: isobutoxy and oxo (keto), so that would be a geminal di-substituted carbon. Wait, that would be a possible structure if the molecule is:

CH2-CH(Et)-C(Ox)-O(i-Bu)-COOH ?

Wait, wait, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is pentanoic acid, so five carbons, with COOH at the end. So positions are 1 (COOH), 2, 3, 4, 5. So substituents are at 3 (ethyl) and 5 (isobutoxy and oxo). So the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O)(O-i-Bu)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, perhaps it's:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O-O-i-Bu)-CH2- ?

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O)-O-i-Bu.

But that would require the 5 position to have both an O-i-Bu and a ketone, which would be a geminal di-substitution. But that's possible. So that's the starting material.

Now, when treated with LiBH4 and H+, what happens? Well, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. Maybe it reduces the ester group? But wait, the starting material is a carboxylic acid. Oh wait, unless it's an ester. Wait, the options say A and B are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So it's a carboxylic acid, not an ester. Hmm.

Wait, LiBH4 can reduce carboxylic acids to alcohols, but under what conditions? Typically, LiBH4 doesn't reduce carboxylic acids directly; they need to be activated, like as esters or amides. So maybe the starting material is an ester, but the options list it as a carboxylic acid. Hmm, that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an acetal or another type of protecting group.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals. For example, a cyclic hemiacetal, which upon opening would form a ketone. Because LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, maybe it can cleave certain bonds.

Wait, another thought: the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is an open-chain ketone or ester that, upon treatment with a reducing agent, forms a cyclic product.

Wait, let's think about the formation of cyclic ketones via reduction. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, a lactone, which upon reduction would form a diol, but that doesn't seem to fit the product.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketal. For example, an acetal derived from a ketone and a diol. If you reduce such a ketal, perhaps it breaks down into the original ketone and some alcohol.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to think about the specific reagents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters to alcohols, but not sure about acetals. BH3 is used in hydroboration, which is for adding boron to double bonds.

Wait, another approach: The product is a cyclohexenone. How is cyclohexenone formed? Maybe from a cyclic hemiacetal which undergoes reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic acetals, and the reduction breaks the acetal to form the ketone.

Wait, acetals are generally resistant to reduction, but maybe LiBH4 can break them. Acetals are typically made from ketones, so if you reduce an acetal, perhaps you get the ketone back.

Wait, for example, if you have an acetal like (R)-something, and when you treat it with LiBH4, you break the acetal to form a ketone.

So, if the starting material is an acetal, the reduction would break it into a diol and a ketone. But in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone, which suggests that the acetal was part of a ring.

Let me imagine the starting material as a cyclic acetal. Upon reduction with LiBH4, the acetal breaks, and the ketone is formed.

But wait, the product is a six-membered ring. So the starting acetal would be a six-membered ring as well, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a five-membered ring acetal. Wait, but the product is a six-membered ring.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should think about the stereochemistry involved. The product has (R) configuration for one reaction and (S) for the other. So the starting materials must have opposite configurations, or same, depending on how the reaction proceeds.

Wait, the starting materials are A and B, and they produce the product as R and S respectively. So when A is treated with LiBH4, it gives R. When B is treated with BH3, it gives S.

So the reagents and the starting material's configuration would influence the product's configuration.

Hmm, but BH3 is a reagent used in hydroboration, which is an anti-Markovnikov addition and follows the BH3's approach (like in the BH3-THF method, which gives the less substituted alcohol, but that's for alkenes).

Wait, but if the starting material is an acetal, and the reaction is a reduction, then the stereochemistry of the starting acetal would determine the configuration of the product.

But I'm not entirely clear on that. Let me think of the possible mechanisms.

If the starting material is an acetal, say, (R)-configured, and upon reduction (with LiBH4 or BH3), the acetal breaks and forms a ketone. The configuration of the ketone would depend on whether the acetal was R or S.

Wait, but wait, acetals are generally not chiral centers if they're symmetric. So if the starting material is a cyclic acetal with a chiral center, then upon reduction, it would form a ketone with a specific configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal. But acetals are more commonly used in protecting carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals. For example, if the starting material is a cyclic ketone protected as an acetal.

Wait, but if you reduce an acetal, what happens? Let me think: an acetal is R-O-C-O-R. If you reduce that, perhaps you break the C-O bonds. But I'm not quite sure about the actual reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters, and the reducing agents are converting them into alcohols, but then cyclizing to form the cyclic ketone. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal of a ketone. When the acetal is reduced, the ethoxy groups are removed, and the ketone is released.

Wait, but then the product would be a ketone, which is what we have. So if the starting material is a diethyl acetal of a ketone, upon treatment with LiBH4, which is a strong reducing agent, perhaps it can break the acetal.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a hydride source. It can reduce esters, amides, nitriles, etc. But can it reduce acetals? I'm not entirely sure, but I think that LiBH4 can cleave certain acetals.

If the starting material is an acetal, then LiBH4 could reduce it by breaking the C-O bonds, releasing the alcohol and forming the ketone. But I'm not certain about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester. For example, a cyclic ester (lactone), which upon reduction would form a diol.

Wait, but the product isn't a diol, it's a ketone. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the starting materials are α,β-epoxy ketones. When treated with a reducing agent, the epoxide is opened to form a diol, which then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters of a ketone. When reduced, the ester becomes an alcohol, and the ketone is released.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options given. The options for A and B are both 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, but with different configurations.

So the starting compounds are enantiomers, perhaps. So when reduced with different reagents, LiBH4 and BH3, they form the products with R and S configurations.

Wait, but how does the reagent affect the configuration? Let me think about the reaction.

If the starting material is a carboxylic acid with an isobutoxy and a ketone group on the same carbon (5-oxo and 5-isobutoxy), then perhaps that's a hemiacetal or acetal structure.

Wait, 5-oxo would be a carbonyl, and 5-isobutoxy would be an O-R group. So that would imply that carbon 5 has both a carbonyl and an O-R group attached, making it a geminal di-substitution. That's possible, but how is that structure formed?

Oh wait, perhaps that's a cyclic hemiacetal. For example, the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal where the carbonyl is part of a ring. So when you reduce it, the ring opens to form the ketone.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, which upon reduction with LiBH4 or BH3, would form the corresponding ketone.

Now, the starting materials are A and B, which are enantiomers. So when each is treated with a different reducing agent, the product's configuration depends on the starting material's configuration and the reaction's mechanism.

Wait, but how does the reagent affect the configuration? Since the product is a ketone, which is a planar sp² hybridized carbon, the configuration arises from the starting material's structure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal with a chiral center. When the cyclic hemiacetal is opened, the configuration of the chiral center is retained or inverted, leading to the product's configuration.

Wait, but the product is a ketone, which is a planar structure. So maybe the configuration comes from a different chiral center.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of the reduction of a cyclic hemiacetal.

Suppose the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal with a configuration R. When reduced, the hemiacetal ring opens, and the hydroxyl groups are converted to alcohols. But wait, in that case, the product would be a diol with a ketone, but in our case, the product is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the reduction leads to the formation of a new ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, and upon reduction, it becomes a diol, which then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone. Hmm, that could be possible.

Wait, I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should think about the reaction conditions. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, often used in acidic conditions. BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions, which are done in a solvent like THF and under certain conditions.

Wait, if the starting material is a cyclic acetal, and when treated with LiBH4 (which is a hydride source), perhaps the acetal breaks, releasing the ketone. The configuration of the starting acetal would dictate the configuration of the product.

Similarly, BH3 is not a reducing agent in the same sense as LiBH4. Unless the reaction is a hydroboration reaction, but that's for alkenes. So maybe in this case, BH3 is acting as a reducing agent in a different way.

Wait, perhaps both reagents are used for reducing acetals. But I'm not certain about that. Alternatively, maybe the reactions are hydrolysis followed by reduction.

Wait, another angle: the product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one. So that's a six-membered ring with an oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl at position 4.

So, how would that form from the starting material? The starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let's imagine that when this is treated with a reducing agent, the ester (if it were an ester) would be reduced. But since it's a carboxylic acid, perhaps it's converted into a carboxylic acid derivative.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a hemiacetal ester. Let me think: the 5-oxo and 5-isobutoxy groups would form a cyclic structure. So, maybe the molecule forms a five-membered ring when the oxygen from the isobutoxy group attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, the structure would look like:

The acid is pentanoic acid (five carbons). So position 5 is the end, but with substituents. If the 5th carbon has an isobutoxy and a ketone, that's the same carbon as the carboxylic acid? That can't be, because the carboxylic acid is at position 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think again. The compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the chain is:

1 (COOH), 2, 3 (CH2CH2CH3), 4, 5 (O-i-Bu and O=C-OH? No, because it's 5-oxo is a ketone, so O=C-.

Wait, but 5-oxopentanoic acid would have the ketone on the same carbon as the COOH, which isn't possible. So perhaps the structure is:

The five-carbon chain is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CO-O-i-Bu ?

Wait, that would make the 5 position the same as the COOH, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-pentan-5-oic acid. Oh wait, no, the name is 5-oxopentanoic acid, which would mean a ketone at position 5, but that's the same as the COOH group. That's not possible. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the structure.

Wait, maybe the molecule is an ester. Like, pentanoic acid with an ester group on carbon 5. But the options say it's a carboxylic acid. Hmm.

This is getting a bit too confusing. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about the product and how it's formed. The product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal of a ketone. When the acetal is reduced, it breaks down to form the ketone.

So, for example, if the starting material is a diethyl acetal of some ketone, treating it with LiBH4 would reduce it to form the ketone.

But wait, LiBH4 is a hydride donor, so it would attack the carbonyl. Wait, but acetals don't have a carbonyl group. They have an OR group attached to the carbon. So perhaps the reducing agent is breaking the acetal.

Wait, but acetals are generally not easily reduced with LiBH4. Maybe in this case, the starting material isn't an acetal but another type of protecting group.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone). When LiBH4 is used, it reduces the ester to a diol, which could then cyclize to form the cyclic ketone. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is an α,β-epoxy ketone. When treated with LiBH4, the epoxide opens, forming an alcohol which then could cyclize. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are enantiomers, and when treated with different reagents, they form different diastereomers, but that would lead to different products, not enantiomers.

Wait, the product is (R) and (S), so they are enantiomers. So the starting materials must have the opposite configurations to produce the opposite configurations in the product.

But wait, if the starting materials are enantiomers and the reaction leads to inversion or retention of configuration, then the product would be the same or opposite.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again. The options are A and B, and each is a 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid with R or S configuration.

So the only difference between A and B is their configuration at the chiral center. So when A is treated with LiBH4, the product is (R), and when B is treated with BH3, the product is (S).

So perhaps the configuration of the starting material determines the product's configuration. And the reagent's effect might influence the direction of the reduction.

Wait, but why would LiBH4 and BH3 give different products? They're both reducing agents, but for different types of reactions.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers, and the choice of reagent leads to the formation of the respective enantiomer in the product. But why would that be?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting materials are esters, and the reducing agents are used to reduce them to alcohols. Then, the alcohols could undergo ring-forming reactions to produce the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but how would an alcohol form a cyclic ketone? Maybe through elimination followed by cyclization. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals. Let's think: a cyclic acetal, which upon reduction with LiBH4 would break the acetal to form a diol and a ketone.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting material is an acetal that, upon reduction, forms the ketone in a ring.

Wait, perhaps the acetal is part of a six-membered ring. So when the acetal is reduced, it breaks to form a diol and releases the ketone into the ring.

Wait, but I'm not clear on the exact mechanism. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone substituent. Upon reduction, the ketone is reduced to an alcohol, but that doesn't form a cyclic ketone.

Hmm, I'm not getting anywhere. Let's think about the options again. The options are for A and B, and each is either R or S configuration.

In the product, when A is treated with LiBH4, it gives R. When B is treated with BH3, it gives S. So the reagents influence the configuration based on the starting material's configuration.

So perhaps the reagents' approach determines whether the configuration is retained or inverted.

Wait, but BH3 is used in hydroboration, which is a concerted reaction. The boron adds to the less substituted end (anti-Markovnikov) and the hydrogen to the more substituted. But that's for alkenes.

Wait, in this problem, perhaps the starting materials are alkenes, and the reagents are adding to form alcohols, which then cyclize to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, that's a thought. Suppose the starting materials are alkenes with specific configurations. Then, reaction with BH3 would add in a certain way, leading to the formation of an alcohol with a specific configuration, which upon cyclization forms the cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are epoxides, and the reduction leads to diols that cyclize.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Another approach: perhaps the starting materials are esters, and when reduced, they form alcohols which then undergo elimination to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, for example, if the ester is a cyclic structure, reduction would break it into a diol, which then cyclizes into a ketone.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic acetals, and when reduced, they form the ketone. Let's say the starting material is a cyclic acetal of a ketone. When reduced, the acetal breaks, and the ketone is released, forming the product.

But then, the configuration of the product would depend on the configuration of the starting acetal. So if the starting acetal is R, the product would be R, and if it's S, the product would be S.

So, in this case, A is (R) configuration, so when treated with LiBH4, it gives R-product. B is (S) configuration, when treated with BH3, gives S-product.

Wait, but why would the reagent matter? If both reagents are reducing the same type of starting material, why would they give different products?

Oh, wait, perhaps the reagents are affecting the stereochemistry of the reduction. For example, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that could cause different stereochemical outcomes compared to BH3, which is used in hydroboration.

Wait, but in hydroboration, the stereochemistry is determined by the addition of BH3 to the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are alkenes, and when treated with BH3, they undergo hydroboration to form alcohols with specific configurations, which then cyclize to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, that's a possibility. Let me think: the starting materials are alkenes with R and S configurations. When treated with BH3, they add boron and hydrogen in a certain way, forming alcohols with specific stereochemistry. Then, these alcohols undergo cyclization to form the cyclic ketone.

But the options given are for 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Hmm, perhaps I'm not on the right track.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are amides or other functional groups that upon reduction with LiBH4 or BH3 form the ketone.

Another thought: the starting materials are esters, and when reduced, they form diols, which then undergo elimination to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, for example, the ester is a cyclic ester (lactone), and upon reduction, it becomes a diol, which then cyclizes to form a cyclic ketone. But I'm not sure about the exact mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals, and the reducing agents break them down to form the ketone. The configuration of the starting material would affect the product's configuration.

In this case, if the starting material is (R)-configured, the product would be (R), and if (S), the product would be (S).

So, looking back at the options, the possible pairs are:

Option D: A is R, B is S.

So when A (R) is treated with LiBH4, it gives R-product. When B (S) is treated with BH3, it gives S-product.

But why would the reagent matter? Because perhaps LiBH4 and BH3 have different selectivities in breaking the acetal.

Alternatively, maybe the reagents are affecting the way the acetal is opened, leading to different configurations.

Wait, perhaps the stereoselectivity of the reduction depends on the reagent. For example, LiBH4 may open the acetal in a way that retains the configuration, while BH3 may cause inversion, or vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps the reducing agents are acting on different parts of the molecule, such as reducing an ester to an alcohol, which then cyclizes to form the ketone.

But without knowing the exact mechanisms, it's hard to say. However, given the options, the correct starting materials must be enantiomers, leading to the respective R and S products based on the reagent used.

Looking at the options, the only pair that has A and B as enantiomers is option D: A is R, B is S.

So I think the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying the proper starting materials (A and B) for two reactions that produce enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reactions use different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The key is to determine how the starting materials' configurations influence the stereochemistry of the products.

The product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, is a cyclic ketone. The starting materials are given as 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, with the only difference being their configurations (R or S). The stereochemistry of the product depends on the configuration of the starting material and the reaction conditions.

1. **Reagents and Their Roles**:  
   - LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce esters or other carbonyl-containing compounds.  
   - BH3 is commonly used in hydroboration reactions, which add boron and hydrogen across double bonds in a specific stereochemical manner (anti-Markovnikov addition).  

2. **Starting Materials**:  
   The starting materials, A and B, are enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Their configurations (R or S) determine the stereochemistry of the products.  

3. **Reaction Mechanism**:  
   The starting materials likely form cyclic intermediates (e.g., acetals or hemiacetals) that, upon reduction, yield the cyclic ketone. The stereochemistry of the starting material dictates the configuration of the product.  

4. **Key Observations**:  
   - When A (R-configuration) is treated with LiBH4, it produces the (R)-enantiomer of the product.  
   - When B (S-configuration) is treated with BH3, it produces the (S)-enantiomer of the product.  
   - The reagents influence the stereochemical outcome based on the starting material's configuration.  

5. **Correct Pairing**:  
   The starting materials must be enantiomers to produce the enantiomeric products. Among the options, only **Option D** pairs A as (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B as (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, ensuring the correct stereochemical relationship between the starting materials and products.

**Answer: D**
