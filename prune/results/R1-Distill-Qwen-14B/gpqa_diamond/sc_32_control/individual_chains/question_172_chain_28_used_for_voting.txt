Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when atoms are in different energy levels, it has something to do with temperature and maybe the Boltzmann distribution. Let me think through this.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in different energy states to temperature. The equation is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), right? Because higher energy states have fewer particles unless the temperature is really high.

Wait, in this case, star_1 has twice as excited atoms as star_2. So if I consider the ratio of excited atoms in star_1 to star_2, it's 2. Let me denote the number of excited atoms in star_1 as n1 and star_2 as n2. So n1/n2 = 2. But according to the Boltzmann factor, n1/n2 = exp( -(ΔE)/(k T1) ) / exp( -(ΔE)/(k T2) ). Wait, no, because the energy difference is the same for both stars. Wait, the energy difference between the levels is given, so ΔE is same for both. So the ratio would be [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ].

Wait, let me write it correctly. The ratio n1/n2 is [ (g1 / g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1' / g2') * exp( -(E1' - E2')/(k T2) ) ) ]? No, maybe I'm complicating it. Wait, the problem says the atoms are in a specific energy level. So perhaps the ground state and an excited state. Let me think: each star has two energy levels, say lower and higher. For each, the ratio of higher to lower is (n_high)/(n_low) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is positive for higher energy (since E_high > E_low).

Wait, no. Wait, for star 1, the ratio n1_high / n1_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star 2, it's n2_high / n2_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). But the question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So n1_high is twice n2_high? Or is it that the ratio of n1_high to n1_low is twice the ratio of n2_high to n2_low? Hmm, the wording is a bit tricky.

Wait the question states: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps, for each star, you have two energy levels. Let me assume that 'excited' refers to the higher energy level. So for star_1, the number of atoms in the excited state is twice that in star_2: n1_excited = 2 * n2_excited.

Wait, but that might not be the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is higher in star_1. That is, the excitation is higher. So n1_excited/(n1_ground) = 2 * (n2_excited/(n2_ground)). But wait, no, the question says the atoms are twice as excited, so perhaps the total number of excited atoms is twice as much. Or perhaps the ratio of the excited level to another level is twice.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me restate: The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So perhaps the number of atoms in an excited state (let's say level 2) is twice that in star_2. So n1_2 = 2 * n2_2.

But each has their own excitation. So using the Boltzmann factor, for star_1: n1_2 / n1_1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star_2: n2_2 / n2_1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). But wait, we don't know n1_1 or n2_1, but perhaps we can take the ratio of n1_2 to n2_2.

Wait, perhaps take the ratio of (n1_2 / n1_1) to (n2_2 / n2_1). That would be [n1_2/n2_2] = [ (n1_2/n1_1) * (n2_1/n2_2) ) ].

Because n1_2 = 2 n2_2, so (n1_2 / n2_2) = 2.

So 2 = (n1_2 / n1_1) * (n2_1 / n2_2 )

But (n1_2/n1_1) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

And (n2_2/n2_1) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So (n2_1 / n2_2 ) = 1 / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) = exp( ΔE/(k T2) )

Putting it together:

2 = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] * [ exp( ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Which simplifies to:

2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Take natural log on both sides:

ln(2) = [ (-ΔE/(k T1)) + (ΔE/(k T2)) ]

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ]

Hmm, okay. So grouping terms:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) [ (T1 - T2) / ( T1 T2 ) ) ]

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So,

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

But the question gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but the equation we have is about ln(2) in terms of T1 and T2.

Wait, but looking at the options, they don't have any terms with ΔE or k. So perhaps the equation can be rewritten in terms of temperatures. Alternatively, maybe we can assume that T1 and T2 are such that the (ΔE/(k)) term is accounted for in the options.

Wait, let me think. Let me denote (ΔE)/(k) = some value. But perhaps in the options, the expression is independent of ΔE. So perhaps the equation ln(2) relates to (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), scaled by some factor.

Wait, but none of the options have any factors with ΔE or k. So perhaps the question expects us to ignore the ΔE term, assuming that it's incorporated into the equation.

Wait, but I'm probably overcomplicating. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / ( T1 T2 )

Wait, but in our equation, ln(2) equals (ΔE/(k)) multiplied by (T1-T2)/(T1 T2 )

So that would imply that the equation is ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But the options don't have ΔE or k. So perhaps the correct equation is D, because the form matches, and the other options don't seem to fit.

Wait, but looking back, the question states that the energy difference is given, but perhaps the multiple-choice expects us to set (ΔE)/(k) as a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that (ΔE)/(k) is equal to 1, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, but wait, let me think about the form of the equation. The equation we derived is:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So, if we can factor out (ΔE/(k)), which is a constant, then the equation becomes ln(2) = some constant multiplied by (T1-T2)/(T1 T2 )

But the options don't have any constants. So perhaps the correct option is D, but only if the ΔE/(k) term is part of the given data.

Wait, but the question is giving the energy difference as 1.38e-23 J. So perhaps the equation is more involved. Let me compute (ΔE)/(k) with these numbers.

The Boltzmann constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Wait, yes, exactly. So ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. So (ΔE)/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Ah! Oh, that's a crucial point. So (ΔE)/(k) equals 1 K.

So substituting back into our equation:

ln(2) = [ (1 K) * (T1 - T2) ] / ( T1 T2 )

Which simplifies to:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Which is exactly the form of option D.

So the correct equation is option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

The question involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The key insight is that the excitation of atoms follows the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the ratio of atoms in different energy levels to temperature. The Boltzmann equation is given by:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of two energy levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

For star_1, the number of excited atoms is twice that of star_2, so:

\[
\frac{n_{1,\text{excited}}}{n_{2,\text{excited}}} = 2.
\]

Using the Boltzmann equation, the ratio of excited to ground-state populations for each star is:

\[
\frac{n_{1,\text{excited}}}{n_{1,\text{ground}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{2,\text{excited}}}{n_{2,\text{ground}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the ratio of these two equations:

\[
\frac{n_{1,\text{excited}}}{n_{2,\text{excited}}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k}\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting \(\frac{n_{1,\text{excited}}}{n_{2,\text{excited}}} = 2\):

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k}\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k}\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Simplifying \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\):

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Substituting this back:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is given as \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), and the Boltzmann constant \(k\) is \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\). Thus:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.38 \times 10^{-23}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} = 1.
\]

The equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. The other options do not align with the derived equation.
