Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll take it slow.

So the setup is an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is twice that, so 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs. But maybe I don't need the exact value right away.

12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, the point P has a charge, and the other 12 are arranged around it at a distance of 2 meters. Okay, so it's like the 13th charge is at the center, and the 12 others are on a sphere of radius 2 meters around it.

The question is about the minimum energy of the system. Oh wait, I remember that in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of point charges is the work done to assemble them. But since this is an isolated system, maybe we just consider the potential energy between all pairs.

Wait, but since the charges are fixed in place (except the one at P?), wait, noâ€”the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, so their positions are fixed relative to P. Hmm. So the 13th charge is fixed at P, so I think all the charges are fixed in position. So the system's potential energy is the sum of the potential energies between each pair.

Wait, but wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So the 12 charges are each at 2 meters from P. So each of those 12 is at 2 meters from the fixed charge. So the potential energy would come from two sources: the energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and also the energy between each pair of the 12 charges themselves.

But wait, do I need to consider all possible pairs? Because the problem is about the total potential energy of the system. So the potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies between every pair of charges.

Let me break it down. The potential energy for a pair of charges is given by Coulomb's law: U = (k * q1 * q2) / r. Since all charges are identical, each pair contributes the same amount, but I have to count how many pairs there are.

Wait, but wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th. So the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12 is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m). So 12 terms of that.

Additionally, the 12 charges are all at the same distance from each other? No, because they're all at 2 meters from P, but they could be arranged in a sphere. So the distance between any two of the 12 charges would be the chord length of a sphere with radius 2 meters. Wait, but wait, the problem doesn't specify how they are arranged, just that each is 2m from P. So for the 12 charges, each is on the surface of a sphere of radius 2 m. So the distance between any two charges would be sqrt( (2)^2 + (2)^2 - 2 * 2 * 2 * cos(theta) ), but wait theta is the angle between them as seen from P. But without knowing the arrangement, maybe the problem is assuming they are all at the same distance from each other? Or perhaps because the system is isolated and in equilibrium, but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I can't assume that. Hmm, this complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy between the 12 charges is not considered, but wait no, they are all part of the system, so their mutual interactions contribute to the total energy.

Wait, but wait, no, because if all 12 are constrained to be at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P, then the 12 are arranged at the surface of a sphere. But their relative distances vary. So the potential energy between each pair of these 12 would depend on their separation. But without knowing their exact positions, perhaps the problem is set up in such a way that the 12 are arranged symmetrically, so perhaps we can compute the average or some other simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating each of the 12 as being only in interaction with the 13th charge, and not with each other. That would make the problem easier, but I don't think that's the case, because the problem is asking for the minimum energy, which would likely involve all interactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that each is equally spaced from the others. But that might not be the case unless it's a regular polyhedron or something. Hmm. Maybe the problem is only considering the energy between the 13th and each of the 12, and not the energies between the 12 themselves. But that seems unlikely because the question is asking for the minimum energy of the entire system, which would include all interactions.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy cancels out or is zero. But that doesn't make sense because all are positive charges. If all charges are positive, then each pair would repel and thus have a positive potential energy. So the mutual interactions would add to the total energy.

Wait, but why would the mutual interactions of the 12 charges be considered? Because the system is isolated, so the potential energy is the sum over all pairs.

So, the total potential energy U is the sum of two parts:

1) The potential energy between the 13th charge (at P) and each of the 12 charges (at 2 m from P).

2) The potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges (each pair is at a certain distance from each other, which we'll have to figure out or perhaps assume to be 2 m in some arrangement, but that's not correct because they are on a sphere of radius 2 m; their separation would be more than 2 m for some pairs and less for others. Wait, no, in a regular arrangement, the distance between adjacent charges on a sphere would be the same, but perhaps that's beyond the scope here. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the setup is that each of the 12 charges is at 2 m from P, meaning that each is on the surface of a sphere of radius 2 m. But the distance between any two of them would be determined by the angle between their positions as viewed from P. But without knowing the arrangement, maybe the problem is simplifying by considering that the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that the distance between any two is 2 m. But that's not possible for 12 points on a sphere of radius 2 m because the maximum number of equidistant points on a sphere is limited. For example, in a regular icosahedron, you can have 12 points with equal distances, but perhaps that's the assumption here. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is 2 m from each other as well. But that's not possible unless they are arranged in a regular dodecahedron or something, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and not the mutual interactions among the 12. Because if that's the case, then the calculation becomes straightforward.

But that's a big assumption. Let me think again. The problem states that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. The 13th is fixed at P. So perhaps the 12 are all at 2 m from P, but their positions relative to each other aren't fixed. So they could be anywhere on the surface of the sphere. But in that case, their mutual distances vary, so the potential energy between any two of them would depend on where they are placed.

But the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So perhaps the minimum potential energy would occur when the mutual repulsions are minimized. How? Well, since all charges are positive, bringing them closer together would decrease the potential energy, but in this case, their positions are constrained to 2 m from P. Wait, but perhaps the arrangement that minimizes the mutual potential energy is when all are as close as possible to each other, but that would require them to be as close as possible on the sphere, perhaps all at the same point. But that's impossible because the charges are identical and would repel each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered to be zero because they're in a configuration that doesn't contribute to the energy. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the 13th charge and the others, and not their mutual interactions. But that's unclear.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, it says "the minimum energy of this system." So perhaps the minimum occurs when the 12 charges are as close as possible to each other, but given that they're constrained to be 2 m from P, their positions are fixed, so their mutual distances are fixed as well. Wait, but no, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but their positions relative to each other can vary as long as they're on the sphere. So perhaps the mutual potential energy could be minimized when they are arranged in a way that the sum of their mutual potentials is the smallest possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the others, and not the mutual interactions. Because that's the only way to make the problem manageable, perhaps. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the potential energy formula. For a system of charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So:

U_total = U_13 + U_12_13 + U_23_13 + ... + U_12_13 (twelve terms) + U_12_13 (all pairs among the 12 charges).

Wait, no. Let me clarify: each charge in the 12 interacts with the 13th charge, and each pair of the 12 charges also interact.

So the total potential energy U is:

U = sum over all pairs.

Each pair is either the 13th with one of the 12, or a pair among the 12.

So number of terms:

- The 13th charge interacts with each of the 12: 12 terms.

- The 12 charges each interact with 11 others, but each pair is counted twice in that approach, so the number is (12 * 11)/2 = 66 terms for the mutual interactions.

So total U is the sum of 12 terms (13th charge and each 12) plus 66 terms (all pairs among the 12).

But calculating the mutual interactions among the 12 would require knowing the distance between each pair, which depends on their arrangement. Without knowing the exact positions, the problem might be making an assumption, perhaps that all the 12 are equally spaced on the sphere, so the distance between any two is the same.

Wait, but if there are 12 charges on a sphere, perhaps they're arranged as vertices of an icosahedron, which has 12 vertices. In that case, each pair of adjacent vertices is the same distance apart. But wait, an icosahedron has 12 vertices, each connected to 5 others. But wait, for each vertex, how many other vertices are adjacent? Hmm, perhaps but it's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged such that each is at the vertex of a regular icosahedron inscribed in the sphere of radius 2 m, so the distance between adjacent charges is the same. But even so, the distance would be less than 4 m, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying and assuming that each of the 12 charges is 2 m from every other charge, which would make the problem manageable. But that's not physically possible because on a sphere of radius 2 m, the maximum number of points that can be all equidistant from each other is limited, and 12 is more than that (like for a regular tetrahedron, you can have 4 points all equidistant, etc.).

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that would require them to be at a single location, which would cause them to be at zero distance from each other, leading to infinite potential energy. That's not feasible, so the problem must be assuming a particular arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that the distance between any two is 2 m. Wait, but if two points are 2 m from P, the distance between them would be d = 2 * 2 * sin(theta/2), where theta is the angle at P. Hmm, but to get d=2 m, sin(theta/2) would have to be sqrt( (2^2 + 2^2 - 2^2) ) / (2 * 2) ) Wait, that's not correct. Let me think. The distance between two points on a sphere of radius r separated by angle theta at the center is d = 2 r sin(theta/2).

So if I want d=2 m, and r=2 m, then:

2 = 2 * 2 * sin(theta/2)
=> 2 = 4 sin(theta/2)
=> sin(theta/2) = 0.5
=> theta/2 = 30 degrees
=> theta = 60 degrees.

So the angle between any two points is 60 degrees. But with 12 points, it's impossible for all pairs to have the same angle because the number of pairs exceeds the possible arrangements.

So perhaps the problem is assuming that all the 12 charges are at the same distance from each other, which would only be possible in a regular polyhedron with a specific number of vertices. For 12 points, that's a regular icosahedron. Wait, but in an icosahedron, each vertex is connected to 5 others, but the distance between non-adjacent vertices is longer. So perhaps the problem is only considering the adjacent pairs, but that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and not the mutual interactions among the 12. That would make the problem solvable, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.

But if the problem is only considering the central charge's interactions, then the calculation is straightforward. Let's proceed under that assumption, but I'm a bit uncertain. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual interactions are considered to be zero, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, let me re-read the question to see if I missed any clues. "What is the minimum energy of this system correct to three decimals?" Hmm, the term 'minimum' suggests that perhaps the system is in a state of lowest possible energy, which would mean the charges are arranged in a way that the potential energy is minimized.

Wait, in electrostatics, the potential energy is minimized when the charges are as close as possible, but in this case, the 12 are constrained to stay 2 m away from P. So perhaps their mutual arrangement would cause their mutual potential energy to be as low as possible, but since all are positive, bringing them closer would lower potential energy, but their positions are fixed on the sphere. So perhaps the minimum mutual potential energy occurs when the 12 are arranged in the most compact way possible on the sphere.

But without specific information on their arrangement, perhaps the problem is considering only the energy between the 13th and each of the 12 charges, and not the mutual interactions. Because otherwise, the problem would require more information, which it doesn't provide.

So let's proceed with that assumption: that the mutual interactions among the 12 are negligible or not considered, and that the total potential energy is just the sum of the interactions between the 13th and each of the 12.

So each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P. Each has charge 2e.

The potential energy for each pair between the 13th and a 12th charge is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r.

So q1 = 2e, q2 = 2e, r = 2 m.

So U_one = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2 m) )

Which simplifies to U_one = (k * (4 e^2)) / 2 m = (2 k e^2) / m.

Wait, no, wait:

(2e) * (2e) = 4 e^2.

Divided by 2 m: 4 e^2 / (2 m) = 2 e^2 / m. Then multiplied by k.

So U_one = k * (4 e^2) / (2 m) ) = 2 k e^2 / m.

But wait, wait, no: 4eÂ²/(2 m) is (2 eÂ²)/m, multiplied by k gives 2 k eÂ²/m.

So each of the 12 pairs contributes this U_one. So total U is 12 * U_one.

So U_total = 12 * (2 k eÂ² / (2 m )) ) ? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula is U = k q1 q2 / r.

So for each of the 12, it's (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m) ) = [k * 4 eÂ² ] / (2 m) ) = [ 2 k eÂ² ] / m.

So each of the 12 contributes 2 k eÂ² / m.

Thus, total U is 12 * (2 k eÂ² / m ) = 24 k eÂ² / m.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure.

Wait, k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N mÂ²/CÂ².

e is elementary charge, about 1.602 x 10^-19 C.

So plugging in the numbers:

k = 8.988e9 N mÂ²/CÂ²

e = 1.602e-19 C

m = 2 meters.

So U_total = 24 * k * e^2 / m.

Wait, let's compute that.

Calculating e^2: (1.602e-19 C)^2 â‰ˆ 2.566e-38 CÂ².

So U_total = 24 * (8.988e9) * (2.566e-38) / 2.

Wait, the denominator is 2 m, so 2 m is the distance between the 13th charge and each of the 12.

Wait, no, the distance is 2 m, so the denominator is 2 m.

Wait, no, wait, the expression I had was (2e)(2e) / (2 m). So that's correct.

But when I calculated the U_one, I have 2 k eÂ² / m. So the U_one is (k * 4 eÂ²) / (2 m) ) = (2 k eÂ²) / m.

So 12 * U_one would be 12 * 2 k eÂ² / m = 24 k eÂ² / m.

Wait, but wait, 24 is 12 * 2, yes.

So let me compute this step by step.

Compute k eÂ²: 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, (1.602e-19)^2 = (approx) 2.566e-38.

So 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = let's compute that.

Multiply 8.988e9 by 2.566e-38:

8.988e9 = 8.988 x 10^9

2.566e-38 = 2.566 x 10^-38

Multiplying these gives approx 8.988 * 2.566 = about 23. (Well, 8.988 * 2.5 is 22.47, 8.988 * 0.066 is about 0.594, so total about 23.06. So 23.06 x 10^(9-38) )= 23.06e-29.

So 23.06e-29 = 2.306e-28.

Then, U_total = 24 * (2.306e-28) / 2.

Wait, wait, no, because k eÂ² is part of the term, and then we have 24 * (k eÂ²) / m.

Wait, m is 2 m, so denominator is 2.

So U_total = 24 * (k eÂ²) / 2 = 12 * (k eÂ²) * (2) ?

Wait, no. Let me re-express:

U_total = 24 * (k eÂ²) / (2 m) )? No, because each U_one is 2 k eÂ² / m. So U_total is 24 * (k eÂ² ) / m.

Wait, no, no, no. Let me re-examine.

Wait, U_one is (k * (2e)^2) / (2 m) ).

So that's (k * 4 eÂ²) / (2 m) ) = (4 k eÂ² )/(2 m) ) = (2 k eÂ² ) / m.

So each of the 12 contributes 2 k eÂ²/m.

Hence, total U = 12 * ( 2 k eÂ² / m ) = 24 k eÂ² / m.

Wait, but m is 2 m. So the denominator is 2 m.

Wait, no, wait, m is 2 meters. So the denominator is 2 m.

So U_total = 24 * k eÂ² / (2 m) ) ?

Wait, no. Because each term is (2 k eÂ²) / m, so:

U_total = 12 * (2 k eÂ² / m ) = 24 k eÂ² / m.

Wait, but m is 2 meters here.

So substituting:

U_total = 24 * (k eÂ²) / 2.

Because m=2.

So that's 12 * (k eÂ²) * (2 / 2) â†’ 12 * 2 * (k eÂ²)/2 â†’ no, wait:

Wait, m=2, so the denominator is 2.

So 24 k eÂ² / m â†’ 24 k eÂ² / 2 = 12 k eÂ².

So U_total = 12 * k * eÂ².

Wait, but let me re-calculate that.

Wait, U_total=24 k e^2 / m, with m=2 m.

So 24 * k eÂ² / 2 = 12 k eÂ².

So U_total = 12 * k eÂ².

Wait, but wait, earlier step:

Each U_one is 2 k eÂ²/(2 m) )? No, no, wait.

Wait, no, the initial formula was U_one = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2 m) )= (4 k eÂ²)/(2 m) )= (2 k eÂ²)/m.

So each of the 12 charges contributes 2 k eÂ²/m.

So U_total = 12 * (2 k eÂ²/m ) = 24 k eÂ²/m.

But m is 2 m, so 24 k eÂ² / 2 = 12 k eÂ².

So U_total = 12 k eÂ².

Wait, is that correct?

But that would be 12 multiplied by Coulomb's constant multiplied by e squared.

Wait, so U_total = 12 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, but earlier calculation: 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 â‰ˆ 2.306e-28 J.

So U_total = 12 * 2.306e-28 â‰ˆ 27.67e-28 J.

Wait, 12 * 2.306e-28 = 27.672e-28 J.

Which is 2.7672e-27 J.

But looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is about three times higher than this.

Hmm, so perhaps I missed a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the initial step: Each pair between the 13th and each of the 12 is (k * q1 * q2) / r.

q1 is 2e, q2 is 2e, r is 2 m.

So U_one = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m) ) = (4 k eÂ²) / (2 m) ) = (2 k eÂ²)/m.

So each pair contributes 2 k eÂ²/m.

12 pairs â†’ 12 * (2 k eÂ²/m ) = 24 k eÂ²/m.

m is 2 â†’ 24 k eÂ² / 2 = 12 k eÂ².

So U_total = 12 k eÂ².

Wait, but 12 * k * eÂ² is 12 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, let me compute that.

Compute e^2: (1.602e-19)^2 â‰ˆ 2.566e-38 CÂ².

k is 8.988e9 N mÂ²/CÂ².

So k * eÂ² = 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 â‰ˆ 2.306e-28 (as before).

Then, U_total = 12 * 2.306e-28 â‰ˆ 27.67e-28 J = 2.767e-27 J.

Wait, but that's about 2.767e-27 J. None of the options match exactly, but let's look again:

Options are:

A) 5.645e-26

B) 2.822e-26

C) 7.056e-27

D) 122.330

Wait, 2.767e-27 is approximately 0.277e-26, which is not matching any of the options.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, let me compute k * eÂ² again.

k = 8.988e9 N mÂ²/CÂ²

eÂ² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 CÂ².

So k * eÂ² = 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = let's calculate this.

8.988e9 = 8.988 Ã— 1e9.

2.566e-38 = 2.566 Ã— 1e-38.

Multiplying: 8.988 * 2.566 â‰ˆ 23.06.

Exponents: 1e9 * 1e-38 = 1e-29.

So 23.06e-29 = 2.306e-28 JÂ·mÂ²/CÂ² * CÂ² â†’ units are JÂ·mÂ², but we'll handle that later.

So U_total = 12 * (2.306e-28) = 27.672e-28 = 2.7672e-27 J.

Hmm, 2.767e-27 J is about 2.77e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher. So perhaps I missed a factor of 3 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the 13th charge's interactions, but that can't be right because the question is about the system, which includes all charges. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs.

Wait, the 13th charge interacts with each of the 12, so 12 terms.

Each term is (k * (2e)^2) / (2 m).

So 12 * (4 k eÂ²) / (2 m) ) â†’ 12 * (2 k eÂ²)/m â†’ 24 k eÂ² / m.

Wait, m=2, so 24 k eÂ² / 2 = 12 k eÂ².

Which brings us back to the same result.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mutual interactions among the 12 charges are considered, which I previously ignored. So perhaps the problem requires calculating both the interactions between the 13th and the 12, and between each pair of the 12.

But then, to calculate that, I need to know the distances between each pair of the 12, which depends on their arrangement. Without knowing that, perhaps the problem is making an assumption that each pair is 2 m apart, but that's not possible for more than a few charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that all the 12 charges are arranged in a regular dodecahedron, but that's a 12-faced polyhedron with 20 vertices, which isn't matching 12 charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the 12 charges as being at points on a regular icosahedron, which has 12 vertices.

In that case, each charge would be at a distance from its adjacent charges. But I'm not sure of the exact distance. Alternatively, perhaps all the mutual distances are the same, so each pair is separated by a distance d.

But without more information, perhaps the problem is treating the mutual potential energy as zero, which is not correct, but maybe it's the intended approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and not the mutual interactions. In that case, the total U is 2.767e-27 J.

But the options don't have that. The closest option is C) 7.056e-27, which is about 3 times our calculated value.

Hmm, 3 times suggests that perhaps each charge is 2e, and perhaps I forgot to consider that each pair contributes twice (e.g., considering both q1 and q2), but no, because in Coulomb's law, each pair is counted once.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, k * eÂ² = 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Let me compute (1.602e-19)^2 again: 1.602^2 is about 2.566, and 1e-38.

So 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

8.988e9 = 8.988 Ã— 1e9.

2.566e-38 = 2.566 Ã— 1e-38.

Multiply 8.988 Ã— 2.566: let me compute that.

8 * 2.566 = 20.528.

0.988 * 2.566 â‰ˆ approximately 2.535.

So total is about 20.528 + 2.535 = 23.063.

So 23.063 Ã— 1e9 Ã— 1e-38 = 23.063e-29 = 2.3063e-28.

Then, 12 * 2.3063e-28 = 27.6756e-28 = 2.76756e-27 J.

Which is approximately 2.768e-27 J.

But option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is about 2.55 times higher.

Wait, 2.768e-27 * 2.55 â‰ˆ 7.05e-27.

Hmm, where could I have gone wrong?

Ah! Wait a minute. I think I made a mistake in the number of terms. Because the 13th charge is at P, and each of the 12 is at 2 m from P, but the 13th charge is fixed. So, for each of the 12 charges, their potential energy with the 13th is (k * 2e * 2e)/2 m. So 12 terms, each giving 2 keÂ²/m.

Wait, but wait, the formula is U = (k q1 q2)/r. So for each pair, that's correct.

But wait, when you have multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum over all pairs. But in this case, the 13th charge is interacting with each of the 12, which is 12 terms. But the 12 charges are also interacting with each other, which is (12 choose 2) = 66 terms. So perhaps the problem wants me to include all these terms.

But without knowing the distance between each pair, it's impossible to calculate. So perhaps the problem is making an assumption that the mutual distances between the 12 charges are the same as the distance from P, which is 2 m.

But that's physically impossible because if all the 12 charges are at 2 m from P, their mutual distances canâ€™t all be 2 m. For example, in a regular tetrahedron, you can have 4 points where each pair is at the same distance, but 12 points would require a more complex arrangement, and mutual distances would vary.

So perhaps the problem is not considering the mutual interactions among the 12, as that would require more information. But then, the calculated value of 2.767e-27 J isn't matching any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of terms. Let me check again.

Wait, each of the 12 charges interacts with the 13th charge, giving 12 terms. So perhaps I should calculate each of those. But that's all I did.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each of the 12 charges has a potential due to the 13th charge and also to the other 11 charges. But without knowing the distances, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual distance between any two of the 12 is 2 m as well. So for each pair among the 12, the distance is 2 m.

But that's not possible for more than a few charges. For example, in a regular tetrahedron, each pair is equidistant, but with 12 points, it's not possible. However, perhaps for the sake of the problem, we're to assume that the mutual distances are 2 m. But that would be an approximation.

So if that's the case, then each pair of the 12 charges is 2 m apart.

So the mutual potential energy between each pair of the 12 is U = k * (2e)^2 / 2 m.

Each such pair contributes U = (4 k eÂ²)/(2 m) ) = 2 k eÂ²/m.

There are (12 choose 2) = 66 such pairs.

So the mutual energy would be 66 * (2 k eÂ²/m ) = 132 k eÂ²/m.

Plus the 12 interactions with the 13th charge, each contributing 2 k eÂ²/m, so 24 k eÂ²/m.

So total U = 24 k eÂ²/m + 132 k eÂ²/m = 156 k eÂ²/m.

Since m=2, that becomes 156 k eÂ²/(2) )=78 k eÂ².

So U_total = 78 k eÂ².

Wait, that would be 78 multiplied by 8.988e9 multiplied by (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, but earlier we found that k eÂ² â‰ˆ 2.306e-28 J.

So 78 * 2.306e-28 = let's calculate.

78 * 2.306 â‰ˆ 78 * 2 = 156, 78 * 0.306 = approx 23.868. So total about 179.868.

So 179.868e-28 = 1.79868e-26 J.

Hmm, but the options don't have this value either.

Wait, let's compute more accurately.

78 * 2.306e-28 = 78 * 2.306 = ?

78 * 2 = 156.

78 * 0.306 = 78 * 0.3 =23.4; 78 *0.006=0.468 â†’ total 23.868.

So 156 +23.868=179.868.

So 179.868e-28 J = 1.79868e-26 J.

Which is approximately 1.799e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is higher than this.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the mutual interactions. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the 12 interactions with the 13th charge, and not the mutual ones. But then the value I calculated earlier is about 2.767e-27 J, which isn't among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from the 13th charge, but the mutual interactions are being counted as well, but perhaps each pair of the 12 is 2 m apart. But that's not physically possible beyond a few points.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are 2 m, forming a regular icosahedron. But wait, an icosahedron doesn't have all mutual distances equal; only adjacent vertices are the same distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual potential energy among the 12 is zero, which is not correct, but maybe it's an oversight.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

The problem says that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So the potential energy is the sum of all pairs:

- 13th with each of the 12.

- Each pair among the 12.

But without knowing the arrangement, perhaps the problem is only considering the 13th charge's interactions, which gives the U we calculated earlier. But that doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of terms. Let me recheck.

Wait, each of the 12 charges interacts with the 13th charge, so 12 terms.

Each of the 12 charges also interacts with the other 11, but each pair is counted once. So the number of mutual terms is (12 * 11)/2 = 66.

So the total U is 12 * (2 k eÂ²/m) + 66 * (2 k eÂ²/m ) = (12 + 66) * (2 k eÂ²/m ) = 78 * 2 k eÂ²/m )= 156 k eÂ²/m.

With m=2, it's 78 k eÂ².

Which is 78 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 â†’ 78 * 2.306e-28 â†’ 1.799e-26 J.

But the options don't have this either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from the 13th charge, but the mutual distances are 4 m. No, that can't be right because the 12 are on a sphere of 2 m radius, so their mutual distances would be at least 0 (if coinciding) and up to 4 m (diametrically opposite).

But that's too broad, and without knowing the exact arrangement, it's impossible to calculate.

So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th and the 12, leading to U = 2.767e-27 J.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each of the 12 charges as being at a distance of 2 m from each other, which would be the same as from the 13th charge. But that's not possible beyond a few points, but perhaps the problem is making that assumption.

In that case, each pair among the 12 charges is 2 m apart. So each pair contributes U = (k * (2e)^2 ) / 2 m = 2 k eÂ²/m.

There are 66 such pairs.

So the mutual potential energy would be 66 * (2 k eÂ²/m ) = 132 k eÂ²/m.

Plus the 12 terms for the 13th charge: 12 * 2 k eÂ²/m = 24 k eÂ²/m.

Total U = (132 + 24) k eÂ²/m = 156 k eÂ²/m.

m=2 â†’ 156 k eÂ²/(2) = 78 k eÂ².

Which is 78 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 = 78 * 2.306e-28 = 1.799e-26 J.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is a distance of 2 m from each of the other 11 charges, which would require a regular polyhedron arrangement, but that's impossible for 12 points. So perhaps it's best to proceed under the assumption that the mutual interactions are zero, but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, which gives 2.767e-27 J, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of terms. Let me recalculate the number of pairs.

Wait, the 13th charge interacts with each of the 12: 12 terms.

The 12 charges interact among themselves as (12 choose 2) = 66 terms.

So the total U is 12 * (2 k eÂ²/m ) + 66 * (2 k eÂ²/m ) = (12 + 66) * 2 k eÂ²/m = 78 * 2 k eÂ²/m = 156 k eÂ²/m.

Which with m=2 is 78 k eÂ².

So U = 78 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Calculate 78 * 8.988e9: 78 *8.988â‰ˆ 702.624 â†’ 702.624e9 =7.02624e11.

Then multiply by eÂ²: (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

So 7.02624e11 * 2.566e-38 = ?

7.02624e11 * 2.566e-38 = (7.02624 * 2.566) Ã— 1e(11-38) ) â†’ 17.99 Ã— 1e-27 â†’ 1.799e-26 J.

Hmm, still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering each charge as having a charge of e, not 2e. Let me recheck the question.

Question says: each with charge 2e. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Coulomb's constant. Let me verify Coulomb's constant: approximately 8.988e9 NÂ·mÂ²/CÂ².

Yes.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12, which gives 2.767e-27 J. But the closest option is C)7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times larger. 2.767e-27 * 3 =8.3e-27, which is still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, 2e is 2 Ã— 1.602e-19 C =3.204e-19 C.

So (2e)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 = approximately 1.027e-37 CÂ².

So k * eÂ² = 8.988e9 * 1.027e-37 = approx 9.25Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me read it carefully. Hmm, it's about electric potential energy in an isolated system. I remember that electric potential energy is related to the work done to assemble charges, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas. Let me think.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about gravitational effects or kinetic energy or anything like that. 

Out of these 13 charges, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th is fixed at P. So point P has one charge, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. I guess they form a sort of spherical arrangement around P, but the exact positions don't matter as much for the potential energy, since it's a function of distance.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Wait, why minimum? Oh, because when you arrange charges, the potential energy depends on their configuration. But wait, in this case, the 12 charges are fixed at 2 m from P, so their positions are fixed. So the potential energy is fixed as well. So the minimum energy would be the potential energy of this configuration. So I just need to calculate the electric potential energy of this setup.

Wait, but how is the potential energy calculated when you have multiple charges? I remember that the electric potential energy of a system of charges is the work required to bring each charge from infinity to their positions. Since all the charges are identical and placed symmetrically, maybe the calculations can be simplified.

Let me think about the formula. The electric potential energy U between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant approximately 8.988 x 10^9 NÂ·mÂ²/CÂ².

But when there are multiple charges, the potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for N charges, each pair contributes to the total. But wait, in this case, we have 13 charges. The 12 at 2 m are all identical, so each of them is at the same distance from the central charge.

Wait, no. Because the 13th is at P, and the others are at 2 m from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from the 13th charge. So the potential energy between each of these 12 and the central charge is the same. So I can calculate the energy for one pair and multiply by 12.

Wait, but that's only part of the story. Because the 12 charges are also interacting with each other. So their mutual potential energy must be considered as well. Oh right! The potential energy of the entire system isn't just the energy between each pair involving the central charge, but also between every pair of the 12 charges.

That complicates things a bit. So the total potential energy U_total is the sum of the potential energies between each of the 12 charges and the central charge, plus the potential energies between each pair of the 12 charges.

Let me break it down. Let me denote each of the 12 charges as q_i, each with charge 2e, and the central charge as q_c, which is also 2e.

First, calculate the energy between each q_i and q_c. There are 12 such pairs. Each contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2 m). Wait, wait, the distance between q_i and q_c is 2 m. So each pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2). So for 12 pairs, that's 12 * [k*(4 eÂ²)/(2)].

Wait no, let me correct that. The charge of each is 2e, so q1 = q2 = 2e. So each pair (q_i and q_c) has U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(r), where r =2 m. So that's (k *4 eÂ²)/2 = 2 k eÂ².

So for 12 pairs, that's 12 * 2 k eÂ² = 24 k eÂ².

Now, the other part is the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges. Since they're all at the same distance from each other? Wait, no. If they're all at 2 m from P, but what about their positions relative to each other? Are they arranged in a sphere of radius 2 m, so each is at a distance from every other charge?

Wait, if all 12 charges are on a sphere of radius 2 m, then the distance between any two charges on the sphere is... Hmm, actually, the distance between two points on a sphere depends on their positions. But since the system is symmetric, perhaps each pair is equidistant on average, but I'm not sure. Wait, but for an exact calculation, this might be complicated.

Wait, but the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So each is 2 m away from P, but the distance between any two charges isn't given. Hmm. Oh, but waitâ€”the problem says that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but they can move on the surface of a sphere of radius 2 m. So their mutual distances vary, but each is 2 m from P.

Wait a second, but the potential energy for the system of 12 charges would be the sum of the potential energies of each pair. The number of pairs is C(12,2) = 66. Each pair has a certain distance between them, but I don't know the exact positions. So how can I calculate the potential energy between each pair?

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem might be assuming that all the 12 charges are at the same point, but that can't be right because they're constrained to be at 2 m from P. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. If all 12 were at 2 m, but in the same location, that would be a different scenario, but in reality, they must be arranged in some way on the sphere.

But for the purpose of calculating the minimum potential energy, perhaps the charges arrange themselves in a way that minimizes the system's potential energy. Wait, but wait, the potential energy can be positive or negative. For like charges, the potential energy is negative when they are close together, but systems tend to have lower (more negative) potential energy when the charges are closer.

Wait, but in this case, since all the 12 charges are identical and positive (assuming e is positive), their mutual repulsion would try to make them as far apart as possible. But the system is constrained such that each is at 2 m from P. So the minimal potential energy would be when they are arranged in the most stable configuration, which for point charges on a sphere would be equally spaced, but perhaps the exact arrangement doesn't matter because all the mutual distances are the same on average.

Wait, but that's not correct. The charges are identical and repel each other, but their positions are constrained to lie on a sphere of radius 2 m. So the potential energy between any two charges would be k*(2e)^2/(d), where d is the distance between them. But since all the 12 charges are on the sphere, the average distance between two points on the sphere can be found.

Wait, but I don't remember the exact formula for the average distance between two points on a sphere. Alternatively, perhaps assuming that each pair is at the same distance from each other as the sphere's diameter? No, that can't be right because the diameter would be 4 m (radius 2 m), but the maximum distance between two points on the sphere would be 4 m (if opposite ends). But that's just one possible pair. Most pairs would be at a shorter distance.

Wait, perhaps I should model the system as the 12 charges being at the vertices of a regular icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius 2 m. Then, the distance between any two adjacent vertices is a fixed value, but some are further apart. But this seems complicated, and I'm not sure if it's necessary.

Wait, but maybe the problem is only considering the energy due to the central charge and the 12 charges, but not the mutual energy between the 12. Let me read the question again. It says, "the minimum energy of this system." Hmm, perhaps the minimum occurs when the 12 charges are as far apart as possible, which would minimize the repulsion between them and thus the potential energy. Wait, no, because repelling charges have negative potential energy. Wait, wait, potential energy for two like charges is positive if they are positive. Because U = k q1 q2 / r, and since q1 and q2 are positive, U is positive. Wait, no, for two like charges, the potential energy is positive because you have to do work to bring them closer. So if they are farther apart, the potential energy is higher. So to minimize the total potential energy (make it as small as possible), you want the charges to be as close as possible. But in this problem, the 12 charges are constrained to a sphere of radius 2 m. So perhaps the minimum mutual potential energy occurs when the 12 charges are arranged in a way that minimizes the sum of 1/r for all pairs. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the other 12. Because the mutual potential energy of the 12 charges may be neglected or maybe the problem is designed to not include that term. Let me think again about the problem statement.

The question says, "the minimum energy of this system." Since the 12 charges are constrained to be at 2 m from P and the 13th is fixed at P. So the system's potential energy would include the energy between each of the 12 and the central charge, plus the energy between all pairs of the 12. But without knowing the exact distances between the 12 charges, perhaps the mutual potential energy can't be calculated and is therefore considered zero, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no. Another approach: the potential energy of the entire system is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So that includes all possible pairs. So the total number of pairs is (13 choose 2) = 78. Wait, no, because the 13th is fixed at P. So each of the 12 charges forms a pair with the 13th. And each of the 12 charges forms a pair with each other.

So the total potential energy is the sum of all these.

So U = sum_{i=1 to 12} [ U between q_i and q_c ] + sum_{i<j} [ U between q_i and q_j ]

Where q_c is the charge at P, and q_i are the other 12.

Now, each U between q_i and q_c is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m) ) = (4 k eÂ²)/(2) = 2 k eÂ².

There are 12 such terms, so first part is 12 * 2 k eÂ² = 24 k eÂ².

Now, the second part is the sum of U between each pair of the 12 charges. Each pair is two charges each with 2e, separated by some distance d_ij.

But what is d_ij? Since each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from P, but their mutual distances vary. For a sphere of radius r, the average distance between two points might be something like (4/3) r. Wait, no, perhaps the average chord length.

Wait, the average distance between two points on a sphere of radius R is (3R)/(Ï€) ). Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think. The chord length between two points on a sphere is 2R sin(theta/2), where theta is the angle between them. The average theta is over the sphere's surface.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the average of 1/d_ij for all pairs. But this seems complicated.

Wait, but wait. Maybe the problem is assuming that the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is zero. But that can't be right because each charge is positive and they repel, so their mutual potential energy would be positive as well.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the mutual potential energy is zero. Or perhaps the question only considers the potential energy between the central charge and the other 12, not their mutual interactions. Then, the mutual energy would contribute a term, but perhaps it's not considered because the problem is designed that way.

Wait, but the options given are all very small numbers, like 1e-26 J, which makes sense because we're dealing with charges on the order of e, which is about 1.6e-19 C. So Coulomb's constant times (e)^2 terms would give something in the order of 1e-28 J, but multiplied by 12 or so.

But let's think: if the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is considered, that would add another term. But without knowing the exact distances, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy between each of the 12 and the central charge. Let me check the options and the numbers.

Wait, let's compute the potential energy without considering the mutual energy between the 12.

Each pair between the 12 and the central charge contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2 m) = (4 k eÂ²)/(2) = 2 k eÂ².

So 12 pairs contribute 12 * 2 k eÂ² = 24 k eÂ².

k is 8.988e9 N mÂ²/CÂ², e is 1.602e-19 C.

So plugging in the numbers:

24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 / (2 m) ?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula for each U between a pair is (k q1 q2)/r. So for each pair involving the central charge, q1 is 2e, q2 is 2e, and r is 2 m. So each U is (k (2e)(2e)) / 2.

So 24 k eÂ² [because 12 * 2 = 24, and 2e *2e is 4 eÂ², divided by 2 gives 2 eÂ² per pair].

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute each term correctly.

Each such pair contributes U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / 2.

Which is (4 k eÂ²) / 2 = 2 k eÂ².

Multiply by 12, so 24 k eÂ².

So U1 = 24 * k * eÂ².

Wait, but wait, k is 8.988e9 NÂ·mÂ²/CÂ², and e is 1.602e-19 C.

So U1 =24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Let me compute that.

First, compute (1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2 x 1e-38 = approx 2.566 x1e-38.

So 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = (8.988 * 2.566) x 1e-29.

Compute 8.988 * 2.566: 8 * 2.5 is 20, 0.988*2.5â‰ˆ 2.47, so â‰ˆ 22.47, but let me compute more accurately.

2.566 * 8 = 20.528

2.566 * 0.988 = approximately 2.566*(1-0.012) = 2.566 - 0.030792 = 2.5352.

So 20.528 + 2.5352 = 23.0632.

So 23.0632e-29 J.

Multiply by 24: 23.0632 *24 = 553.5168e-29 J.

So 5.535168e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, B is 2.822e-26, etc.

But this is only considering the contribution from the central charge and the 12 others.

Now, the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges. Each pair contributes (k (2e)^2 ) / d_ij, but we don't know d_ij for each pair.

Wait, but maybe the 12 charges are arranged in a regular dodecahedron or some other symmetric arrangement on the sphere, and the average distance between any two charges can be determined.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the energy between the central charge and the 12, and not the mutual energy between the 12. Let me think why that might be.

Wait, perhaps the system is isolated, and when considering the system's potential energy, you have to include all pairs. So if we neglect the mutual energy, the answer would be approximately 5.535e-27 J, which is close to option C (7.056e-27) but not exactly.

Hmm, but maybe I made a calculation error. Let me recheck.

Wait, 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Let me compute each step more accurately.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2 = 2.566404, so 2.566404e-38 CÂ².

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 2.566404e-38 = 8.988 * 2.566404 = let's compute that.

8 * 2.566404 = 20.531232

0.988 * 2.566404 = approximately 2.5291.

So total 20.531232 + 2.5291 = 23.060332.

So 23.060332e-29 J.

Multiply by 24: 23.060332 *24 = 553.448. So 553.448e-29 J = 5.53448e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:7.056e-27. No, wait, option C is 7.056e-27, which is larger by about 27% than our value. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute:

Wait, 24 * (k * (2e)^2 ) / 2.

Wait, wait, (2e)^2 is 4eÂ². So each pair contributes 4eÂ²/(2) = 2eÂ².

So 24 * k * 2eÂ². Wait no, 24 * (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2 m) )?

Wait, no, the 2m is the distance. So for each of the 12 pairs, it's (k*(2e)^2)/(2 m).

Wait, k is 8.988e9 NÂ·mÂ²/CÂ².

So each U is 8.988e9 * (4 eÂ²) / 2.

Which is 8.988e9 * (4 * (1.602e-19)^2) / 2.

Wait, 4*(1.602e-19)^2 is 4 * 2.566e-38 = 1.0264e-37.

Divide by 2: 5.132e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 *5.132e-38 = (8.988 *5.132) x 1e-29.

Compute 8.988 *5.132: 

8 *5 =40.

8 *0.132=1.056.

0.988 *5=4.94.

0.988 *0.132â‰ˆ0.130.

So 40 + 1.056 +4.94 +0.130 = approx 46.126.

Wait, but precise calculation: 5.132 *8.988.

Let me compute 5 *8.988 =44.94.

0.132 *8.988= 1.187.

So total 44.94 + 1.187=46.127.

So 46.127e-29 J.

Multiply by 12: 46.127 *12 = 553.524e-29 J =5.53524e-27 J.

Which matches what I got earlier. So 5.535e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 27% higher. So where am I going wrong?

Oh wait, perhaps I forgot that the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is also part of the total. Because if I only consider the central charge and the 12, I'm missing the energy between the 12 themselves.

So I need to calculate the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges as well. But without knowing their exact arrangement, perhaps there's an assumption that their mutual distances are 2 m, but that's not possible since all can't be at the same point.

Wait, but if all 12 charges are at the same distance from each other, say 2 m, but that's not possible because you can't have 12 points on a sphere all separated by 2 m. So perhaps the problem is neglecting the mutual energy between the 12 charges, but that would be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is zero because the charges are arranged symmetrically, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the mutual potential energy is not considered because the problem states that the 12 charges are fixed, so their configuration doesn't change, and thus their mutual potential energy is a constant (but it still contributes to the total energy).

But without knowing the mutual distances, perhaps I can't compute the mutual potential energy. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem says "isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e." So the system's energy includes all interactions.

Wait, perhaps another approach: when the 13th charge is fixed at P, the initial state is all charges at P, and you have to bring the 12 charges to their positions. But that would involve both the energy between the central charge and each of the 12, and the energy between the 12 themselves as they're being brought in.

But if the 12 charges are being placed at 2 m from P, and their mutual distances are some d, then the total energy would be the sum of the work done to bring each charge to its place, considering the existing charges.

Wait, perhaps the proper way to compute the potential energy is to calculate the sum for all pairs. So for each pair of charges, regardless of whether they're the central one or one of the 12, you include their interaction.

So number of pairs is (13 choose 2) =78.

But wait, the central charge is fixed, so each of the 12 charges is at 2 m from it, and the distance between any two of the 12 is d_ij.

But without knowing d_ij, we can't compute exactly, so the problem might not require that term. Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are all 2 m, but that's not feasible for 12 points on a sphere.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energy is zero, but that's not correct. Alternatively, the problem might only consider the potential energy due to the central charge and the 12, and ignore the mutual energy between the 12.

But that would be incorrect because all interactions contribute. So perhaps the problem expects me to only compute the energy between the central charge and the 12, and not include the mutual energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered as part of the system, but without knowing the exact distances, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual energy is zero, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me recompute the energy considering all pairs.

So, the total number of pairs is 78. Each pair contributes k*(2e)^2 / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between the i-th and j-th charge.

But for the 12 charges, each is at 2 m from the central charge (r=2 m). So 12 pairs (central charge and each of the 12) contribute 12 * [k*(2e)(2e)/2].

Which is 12 * (4 k eÂ²)/(2) = 12 * 2 k eÂ²=24 k eÂ².

The remaining pairs are among the 12 charges. There are C(12,2)=66 such pairs.

Each of these 66 pairs has a distance r_ij between them. But what is r_ij? Without knowing their exact positions, we can't compute each r_ij. So perhaps the problem considers that all 12 are at the same distance from each other as from the central charge, which is 2 m. But that's impossible because you can't have 12 points all 2 m apart from each other and from a central point. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual distances are 2 m, which is not realistic but perhaps an approximation.

If that's the case, then each of the 66 pairs contributes (k * (2e)^2)/2 m = (4 k eÂ²)/(2) = 2 k eÂ².

So the mutual energy would be 66 *2 k eÂ² =132 k eÂ².

Adding that to the 24 k eÂ² from the central charge and the 12, the total would be 156 k eÂ².

Wait, but that would give a much larger energy.

156 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, (1.602e-19)^2 is 2.566e-38.

8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =2.306e-28.

Multiply by 156: 156 *2.306e-28 = ~3.6e-26 J.

Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 5.645e-26, which is about 5 times higher. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the mutual energy calculation. If each of the 66 pairs is at 2 m, which would mean the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that's impossible because they're constrained to be 2 m from P. So this approach is incorrect. Therefore, the mutual energy between the 12 can't be calculated without knowing their exact separation, so perhaps the problem expects me to ignore it.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual energy is zero because the charges are arranged in a way that their potential energy cancels out, but I don't think that's the case for identical charges.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a regular icosahedron around the central charge, each at 2 m from P. Then the average distance between two charges can be computed as the average chord length. The formula for the average distance between two points on a sphere of radius R is (3R/Ï€). So R=2 m, so average distance is (3*2)/(Ï€)=6/(3.1416)â‰ˆ1.9098 m. 

Wait, but the exact average distance might not be necessary because each pair contributes 1/d. Hmm, but without knowing each d_ij, perhaps the problem doesn't consider the mutual energy and only asks for the energy from the central charge and the 12.

If that's the case, then the answer would be 5.535e-27 J, which is approximately 5.535e-27. But looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is a bit higher. Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error in the initial step.

Wait, let me compute 24 * k * (2e)^2/(2), but wait, 2e times 2e is 4eÂ², divided by 2 m.

Wait, no, the formula is U = k (q1 q2)/r. So each pair between the 12 and the central is 2e *2e / 2 m.

Which is (4 eÂ²)/(2) = 2 eÂ². Multiply by k for each pair, so 24 *k *2 eÂ²?

Wait, no, wait: each pair has U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / 2. So that's (4 k eÂ²)/2 = 2 k eÂ².

So 12 pairs contribute 12 *2 k eÂ² =24 k eÂ².

Wait, but wait, 2e * 2e is 4eÂ², yes.

So 24 * k * (4 eÂ²) / 2 =24 *k*(2 eÂ²) =48 k eÂ².

Wait, no, wait, no: (2e)(2e)=4 eÂ². Divided by 2 gives 2 eÂ². So each pair U is 2 k eÂ². 12 pairs: 24 k eÂ².

Wait, no, 2e multiplied by 2e is 4eÂ². Divided by 2 gives 2eÂ². So U per pair is 2 k eÂ². 12 pairs: 24 k eÂ².

So 24 *k * eÂ² *2 ?

Wait, no, wait: each pair is (k * (2e)^2 ) / r, where r=2. So (k *4 eÂ²)/(2) =2 k eÂ².

So 12 *2 k eÂ²=24 k eÂ².

So 24 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, (1.602e-19)^2 is 2.566e-38.

8.988e9 *2.566e-38 = 2.306e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 *2.306e-28 =5.534e-27 J.

Which matches my previous calculation.

So the total energy would be 5.534e-27 J, which is approximately 5.53e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:7.056e-27, which is higher. None of the options match exactly. But wait, perhaps the mutual energy between the 12 charges is also considered, but I don't know it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12, and not including the mutual energy between the 12. Then the answer would be approximately 5.53e-27 J, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that's not possible because they're constrained to be 2 m from P. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that each of the 12 charges is at the same distance from each other as from the central charge, which would be 2 m. So each mutual pair of the 12 is also 2 m apart. But that's not possible for 12 charges; they can't all be 2 m apart from each other and from the center. Unless they are arranged on a regular polyhedron where each is 2 m from the center and 2 m from every other charge. But such a polyhedron doesn't exist; the mutual distances would vary.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that all the 12 charges are at the same point. But that would violate the constraint of being 2 m from P. So that can't be.

I'm a bit stuck. Since the options don't match the 5.5e-27 number I calculated, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the initial part.

Each pair between the central charge and a satellite charge contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2) = (4 k eÂ²)/(2) = 2 k eÂ².

So 12 pairs: 12 *2 k eÂ²=24 k eÂ².

Now, k=8.988e9 NÂ·mÂ²/CÂ², e=1.602e-19 C.

So 24 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2=2.566, so 2.566e-38.

8.988e9 *2.566e-38 = (8.988 *2.566) x 1e-29.

Compute 8.988 *2.566:

8 *2.566 =20.528.

0.988 *2.566 = approx 2.535.

Total 20.528 +2.535=23.063.

So 23.063e-29.

Multiply by 24: 23.063 *24=553.512.

So 553.512e-29 J =5.53512e-27 J.

So 5.535e-27 J.

But the options don't have this. The closest is C:7.056e-27.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the mutual energy is included, but perhaps the mutual energy is (66) * [k*(2e)^2/(d)], but what is d?

Wait, perhaps the average distance between the 12 charges is 2 m as well, but that would imply they are all at the same point, which is impossible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual distances are all 2 m, which would make the mutual energy 66 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2) =66 * (4 k eÂ²)/(2) =66 *2 k eÂ²=132 k eÂ².

Adding to the 24 k eÂ² from the central charge, the total is 156 k eÂ².

So 156 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

We have 8.988e9 * (2.566e-38) =2.306e-28.

Multiply by 156: 156 *2.306e-28 = 3.602e-26 J.

Which is about 3.6e-26 J. None of the options match that either.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances average to 2.828 m (2âˆš2), but that's a guess.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the energy between the central charge and the 12, which gives 5.53e-27 J. But the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for Coulomb's constant. Sometimes, k is approximated as 9e9 instead of 8.988e9.

Let me try that.

k=9e9.

So 24 *9e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute:

(1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

9e9 *2.566e-38 =2.3094e-28.

Multiply by 24:24 *2.3094e-28=5.54256e-27 J.

Still around 5.54e-27 J.

Options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A)5.645e-26

B)2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330

Wait, option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 5 times larger than my initial calculation (5.5e-27). Hmm. How?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the formula is U = k * (q1 q2)/r, so for each pair, that's 8.988e9 * (2e)(2e) / 2.

Which is 8.988e9 * (4 eÂ²) / 2 = 8.988e9 * 2 eÂ².

Wait, but e is 1.6e-19, so 2e^2 is 2*(1.6e-19)^2 = 2*(2.56e-38) =5.12e-38.

So 8.988e9 *5.12e-38 = (8.988 *5.12) x1e-29.

8 *5=40, 0.988*5=4.94, 8*0.12=0.96, 0.988*0.12=0.11856.

So 40 +4.94 =44.94, plus 0.96=45.9, plus 0.11856â‰ˆ46.01856.

So 46.01856e-29 J per pair.

Wait, no. Because each pair contributes (2e)(2e)/(2 m) = (4 eÂ²)/(2) = 2 eÂ².

Wait, so per pair, it's k * 2 eÂ².

So for 12 pairs, it's 12 * k * 2 eÂ².

So 12 *8.988e9 * 2*(1.602e-19)^2.

Compute 2*(1.602e-19)^2=2*(2.566e-38)=5.132e-38.

So 8.988e9 *5.132e-38= (8.988 *5.132) e-29.

8.988 *5=44.94, 8.988 *0.132â‰ˆ1.187.

So 44.94 +1.187=46.127.

So 46.127e-29 per pair.

Multiply by 12: 46.127 *12=553.524.

So 553.524e-29 =5.53524e-27 J.

So back to the same number.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy of the entire system, including the mutual energy between the 12. But without knowing the exact distances between them, perhaps the mutual energy is zero, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual energy is negligible compared to the central charge's contribution, but in reality, it's not because the number of pairs is high.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12, and not including the mutual energy. Then the answer would be around 5.5e-27 J, but this isn't an option. Hmm.

Looking again at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J.

Wait, 7.056e-27 is about 1.275 times 5.535e-27.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponent.

Wait, 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 =8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 =2.3e-28 J.

Wait, no, 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 = (8.988 *2.566) * 1e9 *1e-38 =23.06 *1e-29 =2.306e-28 J.

Then, 24 *2.306e-28 =5.534e-27 J.

So that's correct.

But looking at the options, the only option in the same ballpark is C)7.056e-27. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for e. For example, sometimes e is taken as 1.6e-19, but perhaps it's taken as 1.602176634e-19, but that shouldn't change much.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Wait, the central charge is fixed, so each of the 12 pairs contributes once. So 12 pairs is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges not only interacts with the central charge but also with each of the other 11 charges. So the mutual energy is 12 * (each charge contributing (11 * k (2e)^2)/d_ij).

But without knowing d_ij, perhaps the problem is making an assumption that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is at the same distance from each other as from the central charge, which I know is not possible, but perhaps the problem does that.

Assuming each mutual pair is 2 m apart, then the mutual energy would be 66 * (k*(2e)^2 )/2.

Which is 66 * (4 k eÂ²)/(2) =66 *2 k eÂ²=132 k eÂ².

So total energy would be 24 k eÂ² +132 k eÂ²=156 k eÂ².

So 156 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute 8.988e9 *2.566e-38=2.306e-28.

156 *2.306e-28=3.6e-26 J.

Which is option A:5.645e-26 is higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distance is 4 m, the diameter. So each pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/4.

So mutual energy:66 * (4 k eÂ²)/(4) )=66 *k eÂ².

So total energy:24 k eÂ² +66 k eÂ²=90 k eÂ².

Compute 90 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

90 *2.306e-29=2.0754e-27 J.

Which is approximately 2.075e-27 J. Not matching any options.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered, but each of the 12 charges is assumed to be equidistant from each other as 2 m. But as I thought earlier, it's impossible for 12 points on a sphere all to be 2 m apart. So this can't be the case. Thus, perhaps the mutual energy isn't considered, and the problem only asks for the contribution from the central charge and the 12.

Thus, the correct answer would be approximately 5.53e-27 J.

But none of the options match. The closest is option C:7.056e-27 J.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 24 *k * (2e)^2/(2).

Wait, 2e times 2e is 4eÂ², divided by 2 gives 2eÂ².

So 24 *k *2eÂ²=48 k eÂ².

Wait, that's a mistake! No, wait: each pair contributes (k*(2e)^2 )/(2) = (4 k eÂ²)/2=2k eÂ². So 12 pairs contribute 24 k eÂ².

Ah, no, wait, 24 k eÂ².

Wait, but 24 * k * (2e)^2 / (2) =24 *k *4 eÂ²/(2)=24 *2 k eÂ²=48 k eÂ².

Wait, no, that's not correct. Each pair is (k*(2e)^2 )/(2) =2k eÂ².

12 * 2 k eÂ²=24 k eÂ².

So 24 * k *2 eÂ²=48 k eÂ²?

Wait, no, because (2e)^2=4eÂ². Divided by 2 gives 2eÂ².

So each pair contributes 2k eÂ².

12 * 2k eÂ²=24 k eÂ².

Ah, right. So 24 k eÂ².

So 24 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9:2.566e-38 *8.988e9=2.306e-28.

Multiply by 24:24 *2.306e-28=5.534e-27 J.

So yes, 5.534e-27 J.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem expects the mutual energy to be considered as zero. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy is zero. For example, if they're arranged symmetrically, their contributions might cancel out. But that's only possible if the charges are arranged in a way that every pair has an opposite pair, which might not be the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered to be negligible compared to the central charge's contribution. But in reality, with 66 pairs, it's significant.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge and the 12, and not including any mutual energy. Then the answer is 5.53e-27, but it's not an option. The only option close is C)7.056e-27.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exponents. Let me compute 24 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

(1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9:2.566e-38 *8.988e9=2.306e-28.

Multiply by 24:24 *2.306e-28=5.534e-27.

So again, 5.534e-27 J.

So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but among the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 27% higher. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of pairs.

Wait, the central charge is fixed, so the number of pairs involving it is 12, correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps each of the 12 charges is not only interacting with the central charge but also with each of the other 11. So the total number of mutual pairs is 12*11/2=66. But without knowing their distances, perhaps the problem is using the same distance as for the central charge. But this isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy between the central charge and the 12, not the mutual energy. So the answer would be 5.53e-27 J, but it's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 3 somewhere. For example, if the mutual energy is considered as 36 k eÂ², which would make the total 24+36=60 k eÂ².

60 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =60 *2.306e-29=1.3836e-27 J.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged such that each is at a distance of 2âˆš2 m from each other, which is 2.828 m. So for each mutual pair, r=2.828 m.

So each mutual pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2.828)= (4 k eÂ²)/(2.828)= (4/2.828) k eÂ²â‰ˆ1.4142 k eÂ².

So 66 pairs contribute 66 *1.4142 k eÂ²â‰ˆ93.33 k eÂ².

Adding the 24 k eÂ² from the central charge, total is 117.33 k eÂ².

So 117.33 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 *2.566e-38=2.306e-28.

Multiply by 117.33:117.33 *2.306e-28â‰ˆ2.705e-26 J.

Which is close to option A:5.645e-26 J. No, it's about 2.7e-26 J, which is closer to option B:2.822e-26.

Hmm, perhaps. But this is speculative because I don't know the actual mutual distances.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual energy is considered as 36 k eÂ² (for 12*11/2=66 pairs, but perhaps each contributes 0.56 k eÂ²), but this is just a guess.

But this is getting too complicated. Since the options don't include my calculated value, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the mutual energy, and the correct answer is around 5.53e-27, but the options don't have it.

Alternatively, perhaps the charges are arranged in a way that the mutual energy is zero, but that's only possible if the charges are symmetrically placed and opposite in some way, but since they're all positive, that's not possible.

Another possibility: perhaps I should only calculate the potential energy per pair once, but I multiplied by 12.

Wait, no, each of the 12 charges contributes a pair with the central charge, so 12 pairs.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using e instead of 2e, but that would change everything.

Wait, each charge is 2e. So q=2e.

So each pair's contribution is (k * (2e)(2e))/r =4k eÂ²/r.

So for the 12 central pairs, each is 2 m away, so 4k eÂ²/(2)=2k eÂ² per pair. 12 pairs:24k eÂ².

If I messed up the number of pairs, perhaps I thought it was 24 instead of 12. But no, 12 pairs.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered each of the 12 charges as fixed, and the 13th as moving, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is 2 m from P, and the mutual distance is 2 m. So each mutual pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/2=2k eÂ².

But with 66 pairs, that would make the mutual energy 66 *2k eÂ²=132 k eÂ².

Total energy:24 k eÂ² +132 k eÂ²=156 k eÂ².

156 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 *2.566e-38=2.306e-28.

Multiply by 156: 156 *2.306e-28=3.602e-26 J.

Which is option A:5.645e-26. Not matching.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps I should go with the initial calculation, assuming the mutual energy isn't considered, leading to 5.53e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct approach is to include the mutual energy, leading to a higher value.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier, and the correct answer is option C:7.056e-27 J.

Wait, let's compute 24 *k * (2e)^2/(2).

Which is 24 *8.988e9 * (4 eÂ²)/(2).

Which is 24 *8.988e9 * 2 eÂ².

So 24 * 2 =48.

So 48 *8.988e9=4.31424e11.

Multiply by eÂ²: (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

So 4.31424e11 *2.566e-38= 4.31424 *2.566e-27.

4.31424 *2.566 â‰ˆ11.05.

So 11.05e-27=1.105e-26 J.

But this isn't matching any option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 24 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2) =24 * (4 k eÂ²)/(2)=24 *2 k eÂ²=48 k eÂ².

So 48 *8.988e9=4.31424e11.

Multiply by (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

4.31424e11 *2.566e-38=1.106e-26 J.

Which is 1.106e-26 J, which is option B:2.822e-26?

No, option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 2.5 times higher.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents in the calculation. Let me recompute:

24 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 2.566e-38 *8.988e9= 2.306e-28.

Multiply by24:24 *2.306e-28=5.534e-27 J.

So the correct calculation is 5.534e-27 J, which isn't an option.

But looking at the options again, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 27% higher. Perhaps the problem is using a different value for k, like 9e9 instead of 8.988e9.

Let me try that.

24 *9e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

9e9 *2.566e-38=2.309e-28.

24 *2.309e-28=5.542e-27 J.

Still not matching option C.

Wait, perhaps the problem used a different value for e, like 1.6e-19 instead of 1.602e-19.

Let me try e=1.6e-19.

So (1.6e-19)^2=2.56e-38.

24 *8.988e9 *2.56e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 *2.56e-38=2.303e-28.

Multiply by24:24 *2.303e-28=5.527e-27 J.

Still no match.

Hmm. I'm not sure. But given the options, perhaps the correct answer is option C:7.056e-27 J.

But I'm not confident. Another possibility is that I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Perhaps the problem is only considering one charge, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is equidistant from the others, but I'm not sure. Without knowing the exact configuration, I can't compute the mutual energy. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects me to only consider the energy between the central charge and the 12, which gives 5.53e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option B:2.822e-26.

Wait, 2.822e-26 is about 5.1 times larger than 5.53e-27.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 5.12.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that each pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2), which is (4 k eÂ²)/(2)=2k eÂ² per pair. For 12 pairs, 24 k eÂ².

But if instead, I use (k*(2e)^2)/(2 m), which is (4 k eÂ²)/(2)=2k eÂ².

So 12 pairs contribute 24 k eÂ².

Hmm. I think I've exhausted all possibilities. The correct calculation based on the given information, assuming only the central charge's contribution, gives 5.53e-27 J, which isn't an option. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects the inclusion of the mutual energy, leading to a higher value. But without knowing the mutual distances, I can't compute it accurately. Given the options, the closest higher value is option C:7.056e-27 J.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the minimum potential energy of a system of 13 identical charges, each with charge \( 2e \), where 12 charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 m from a central charge fixed at point \( P \). The total potential energy of the system includes contributions from the interactions between the central charge and the 12 charges, as well as the mutual interactions between the 12 charges themselves.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Energy Between the Central Charge and the 12 Charges**:
   - Each of the 12 charges interacts with the central charge. The potential energy for each pair is given by:
     \[
     U = \frac{k (2e)(2e)}{2} = \frac{4 k e^2}{2} = 2 k e^2
     \]
   - There are 12 such pairs, so the total energy contribution is:
     \[
     U_{\text{central}} = 12 \cdot 2 k e^2 = 24 k e^2
     \]

2. **Mutual Energy Between the 12 Charges**:
   - The 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from the central charge, but their mutual distances are not explicitly provided. If the mutual distances are assumed to be the same as the distance from the central charge (2 m), the potential energy for each mutual pair is:
     \[
     U_{\text{mutual pair}} = \frac{k (2e)(2e)}{2} = 2 k e^2
     \]
   - There are \( \binom{12}{2} = 66 \) mutual pairs, so the total mutual energy contribution is:
     \[
     U_{\text{mutual}} = 66 \cdot 2 k e^2 = 132 k e^2
     \]

3. **Total Potential Energy**:
   - The total potential energy of the system is the sum of the energy between the central charge and the 12 charges, and the mutual energy between the 12 charges:
     \[
     U_{\text{total}} = U_{\text{central}} + U_{\text{mutual}} = 24 k e^2 + 132 k e^2 = 156 k e^2
     \]

4. **Numerical Calculation**:
   - Coulomb's constant \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{NÂ·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \), and the elementary charge \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \).
   - Substituting values:
     \[
     U_{\text{total}} = 156 \cdot 8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2
     \]
   - Compute \( (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \).
   - Compute \( 8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.566 \times 10^{-38} = 2.306 \times 10^{-28} \).
   - Multiply by 156:
     \[
     U_{\text{total}} = 156 \cdot 2.306 \times 10^{-28} = 3.602 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
     \]

5. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated total potential energy \( 3.602 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \) does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, the closest option is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, which is smaller by a factor of approximately 5.1. This discrepancy suggests that the mutual energy between the 12 charges may not have been intended to be included in the problem.

6. **Assumption**:
   - If the mutual energy is neglected, the total energy would be dominated by the energy between the central charge and the 12 charges:
     \[
     U_{\text{central}} = 24 k e^2 = 5.534 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - This value is still not listed among the options, but the closest higher value is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**.

### Conclusion:
Given the ambiguity in whether the mutual energy is included and the lack of an exact match to the calculated value, the most reasonable choice based on the provided options is:

**Answer: C**
