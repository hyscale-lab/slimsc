Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish these two states. The options are A through D.

Hmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. It relates the uncertainty in energy to the lifetime of the state. The formula I think is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy and Δt is the lifetime (or the time during which the state exists). 

Wait, but wait. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time is at least ħ/2. So if the lifetime of a state is the time it exists, then that's Δt. So for each state, we can calculate the uncertainty in energy. But how does this help us find the energy difference between E2 and E1?

Wait, the question is about being able to clearly distinguish the two energy levels. So I think that the energy difference between them must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is bigger than the uncertainties, then we can tell them apart. Otherwise, the lines would overlap, and we can't resolve them.

Let me think. Each state has its own lifetime. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE_i = ħ/(2Δt_i). But wait, when you have two states, the energy difference between them is ΔE = E2 - E1. To resolve them, this ΔE must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe just larger than each individual uncertainty. Or perhaps the uncertainty in the difference?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the maximum uncertainty from either state. Let me try to clarify.

Each state has an uncertainty in its energy. For E1, ΔE1 = ħ/(2Δt1). Similarly, for E2, ΔE2 = ħ/(2Δt2).

Wait, but when you're measuring the energy difference between the two states, what's the uncertainty in that difference? I think the uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the individual uncertainties because the two uncertainties are independent. So ΔΔE = ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but maybe not. Because if you have two states with their own lifetimes, the energy difference's uncertainty would be based on the time over which you're observing both. Or perhaps the energy difference's uncertainty is determined by the longer lifetime, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard approach is to calculate the uncertainty for each state and then ensure that the energy difference is larger than the maximum of the individual uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is bigger than both individual uncertainties, then you can distinguish between them.

Let me calculate the uncertainties for each state.

Given:
Δt1 = 1e-9 seconds
Δt2 = 1e-8 seconds

Using ħ = reduced Planck's constant, which is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

So for E1:
ΔE1 = ħ/(2Δt1) = (1.05e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) = 1.05e-34 / 2e-9 = approximately 5.25e-26 J.

Wait, but we usually talk about energy in electronvolts. So I should convert that. 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 joules. So to convert from J to eV, divide by 1.602e-19.

So 5.25e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.28e-7 eV.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me compute that again. Wait, 5.25e-26 / 1.602e-19 = (5.25 / 1.602) * 1e-7 ≈ 3.28 * 1e-7 eV ≈ 3.28e-7 eV. So ΔE1 is about 3.28e-7 eV.

For E2, Δt2 = 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = ħ/(2Δt2) = (1.05e-34) / (2e-8) = 5.25e-27 J. Converting to eV: 5.25e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.28e-8 eV.

So the uncertainties are ΔE1 ≈ 3.28e-7 eV and ΔE2 ≈ 3.28e-8 eV.

Wait, but wait. Because when considering the energy difference between the two states, we have ΔE = E2 - E1. The uncertainty in ΔE would be the sum of the uncertainties in E1 and E2, assuming they are uncorrelated. So ΔΔE = sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ). But since ΔE2 is smaller than ΔE1, it might be negligible.

So ΔΔE ≈ ΔE1 ≈ 3.28e-7 eV.

Wait, but wait. So to distinguish the two states, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in their energy difference. So ΔE > ΔΔE.

Looking at the options, let's see which option is larger than 3.28e-7 eV.

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → 1e-9 is way smaller than 3e-7. So no.

Option B: 1e-11 eV → even smaller, no.

Option C: 1e-4 eV → that's 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 3e-7 eV. 3e-7 is 0.0000003 eV. So 0.0001 is bigger. So option C would be larger than the uncertainty.

Option D: 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 3e-7. So no.

So the only option where ΔE is larger than the uncertainty is option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Because maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me redo the calculations more accurately.

Compute ΔE for each state:

ΔE1: ħ/(2*Δt1) = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-9 = 5.272859e-26 J.

Convert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J. So divide by that.

5.272859e-26 J / 1.602176634e-19 J/eV ≈ (5.272859 / 1.602176634) * 1e-7 eV.

5.272859 / 1.602176634 ≈ approx 3.29. So 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2: (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-8) = 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-8 = 5.272859e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.272859e-27 / 1.602176634e-19 ≈ (5.272859 / 1.602176634) * 1e-8 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So the uncertainties are 3.29e-7 eV and 3.29e-8 eV.

The uncertainty in the energy difference ΔE is approximately the sum of each uncertainty. So sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ) = sqrt( (3.29e-7)^2 + (3.29e-8)^2 ) ≈ 3.29e-7 eV, since (3.29e-8)^2 is much smaller.

So the total uncertainty is roughly 3.29e-7 eV.

Therefore, the energy difference must be greater than this to be resolved. Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 → 0.001e-6 → 1e-9 is less than 3.29e-7 → no.

B) 1e-11 → way too small → no.

C) 1e-4 → 0.0001 eV → that's 1e-4, which is 1e-4 / 3.29e-7 ≈ 304 times larger → yes, bigger.

D) 1e-8 → 0.00000001 → smaller than 3.29e-7 → no.

So the only option that is larger is C.

Wait, but wait another thing. Because in the problem, the states have energies E1 and E2. The energy difference is ΔE = E2 - E1. But how is this related to the lifetimes? Oh, I think the reasoning is correct because the uncertainty in the energy of each state is determined by their respective lifetimes. The energy difference's uncertainty is the sum in quadrature of each uncertainty, but since one is much bigger than the other, the main uncertainty comes from the shorter-lived state (E1, Δt1=1e-9 s, which has a larger ΔE).

So if the energy difference is bigger than the sum of the uncertainties, it can be resolved.

So the correct answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) that can be clearly resolved, we use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy for each state is given by:

\[
\Delta E_i = \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t_i},
\]

where \( \Delta t_i \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). The energy difference between the two states, \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \), must be larger than the uncertainty in the energy difference to ensure distinguishability. The uncertainty in the energy difference is approximately the sum of the individual uncertainties:

\[
\Delta \Delta E \approx \sqrt{(\Delta E_1)^2 + (\Delta E_2)^2}.
\]

### Calculations:
1. For \( E_1 \) with \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 5.272859 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electronvolts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{5.272859 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For \( E_2 \) with \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 5.272859 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electronvolts:
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{5.272859 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

3. The uncertainty in the energy difference is dominated by the larger uncertainty:
   \[
   \Delta \Delta E \approx \Delta E_1 = 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must satisfy:
\[
\Delta E > \Delta \Delta E.
\]

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

### Conclusion:
The only energy difference that satisfies the condition for distinguishability is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
