Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, it's about a star with some spots and the effect on the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in different energy levels. Hmm, I remember that when stars have spots, it affects their overall temperature and maybe the spectrum they emit.

So the star's parameters are: radius 1.5 solar radii, mass 1.1 solar masses. When no spots, Teff is 6000 K. But when 40% surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Oh wait, wait. Wait, I thought that when a star has spots, it's not just the temperature that changes, but I'm a bit confused here. Wait, spots are cooler regions, so when the spots are present, the star's overall brightness as seen from afar would decrease. But the question says the effective temperature of the photosphere decreases. Hmm, I think that's because when spots cover a part of the surface, the overall average temperature goes down.

Now, the main point is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. Wait, the ratio is n1/n2, where n1 is the number of atoms in level 1 and n2 in level 2. So when spots are present, n1/n2 is lower. And we're to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. So factor = (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Wait, but why does the ratio change? Oh, because the temperature affects the ionization state and the excitation of atoms. Since the star's overall Teff decreases, the photosphere is cooler, so the atoms are less likely to be in higher energy levels. Hmm, or maybe it's about the Boltzmann equation for population of energy levels.

Right, the Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of populations (n1/n2) is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where E2 > E1 because it's a higher energy level. Since the transition is between two levels, the energy levels are E1 and E2, and the wavelength is 1448 Å, which is in the near UV. So I think this is about the excitation of Ti atoms.

When the temperature decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller, so the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Because as T goes down, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) is a positive number because E2>E1. So exp(-x) gets smaller as x increases, which happens when T decreases because denominator k T is smaller. So n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), wait no: wait, the ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). Oh right, because the higher energy level has lower population. So when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the exp term is smaller. So n1/n2 would decrease as T decreases.

Wait, but in the problem, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So when the star has spots, the photospheric temperature is lower. So in that case, the n1/n2 ratio is lower than when the star is spotless. So the ratio when no spots is higher than when spots are present.

So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Which is [ (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T_spotless)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T_spotted)) ].

The g1/g2 cancels out since they are same in numerator and denominator. So the factor becomes exp( [ -ΔE/(k T_spotless) + ΔE/(k T_spotted) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T_spotted) - 1/(T_spotless) ] ).

Hmm, but wait, let's compute it step by step. Let me write it again.

Factor = [n1/n2]_no_spots / [n1/n2]_with_spots
= [ (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T_spotless)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T_spotted)) ]
= exp[ (-ΔE/(k T_spotless) ) - ( -ΔE/(k T_spotted) ) ) ]
= exp[ ΔE/(k) (1/(T_spotted) - 1/(T_spotless)) ) ]

Wait no, wait. Let me compute the exponents correctly.

The exponent in the first term is -ΔE/(k T_spotless). The exponent in the denominator's term is -ΔE/(k T_spotted). So when we take the ratio, the exponents subtract.

So:

exp[ (-ΔE/(k T_spotless)) - (-ΔE/(k T_spotted)) ) ]
= exp[ ΔE/(k) (1/(T_spotted) - 1/(T_spotless)) ) ]

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the first term is -ΔE/(k T_spotless), the denominator is exp(-ΔE/(k T_spotted)), so the denominator is in the denominator, becomes exp(ΔE/(k T_spotted)). So overall, the exponents are (-ΔE/(k T_spotless)) + (ΔE/(k T_spotted)).

Factor = exp( [ΔE/(k)] ( 1/(T_spotted) - 1/(T_spotless) ) ) )

Wait no, because:

[exp(a)]/[exp(b)] = exp(a - b).

So, a is (-ΔE)/(k T_spotless), b is (-ΔE)/(k T_spotted).

So a - b is [ (-ΔE)/(k T_spotless) ] - [ (-ΔE)/(k T_spotted) ) ].

Which simplifies to (ΔE /k) [ 1/(T_spotted) - 1/(T_spotless) ].

So the factor is exp( [ΔE/(k)] [ 1/T_spotted - 1/T_spotless ] )

Wait, but T_spotted is 5500 K, T_spotless is 6000 K.

So 1/5500 is about 0.0001818, 1/6000 is about 0.0001667.

Subtracting, 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.0000151.

So the term inside the exp is [ΔE/(k)] * 0.0000151.

But wait, delta E is the energy difference between level 2 and level 1. The transition corresponds to wavelength 1448 Å, which is 1448 Angstroms, or 1.448e-7 meters.

The energy of a photon is E = hc / λ.

So ΔE = hc / λ.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J s.

c is speed of light, about 3e8 m/s.

λ is 1448 Å, which is 1.448e-7 meters.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) ) 

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.373e-18 J.

But I need to convert this to eV because k (Boltzmann constant) is in eV/K terms.

Wait, 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So to convert J to eV, divide by 1.602e-19.

So ΔE = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ) ≈ 8.57 eV.

So ΔE ≈8.57 eV.

But wait, perhaps I should double-check that calculation.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 6.626e-34 * 3e8.

6.626e-34 *3 =1.9878e-33; times 1e8 gives 1.9878e-25 J m.

Divided by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = 

Let me compute that: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18.

1.9878 / 1.448 ≈ 1.373.

So 1.373e-18 J. Now, converting to eV:

1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = (1.373 / 1.602) * 10^( -18 +19 ) eV = approximately 0.857 *10^1 = 8.57 eV. So yes, about 8.57 eV.

So, ΔE =8.57 eV.

Now, k is Boltzmann's constant, which is about 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So [ΔE/(k)] = 8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 100,000 (since 8.617e-5 is 0.00008617, so 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ 100,000).

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

8.57 / 8.617e-5 = 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ 8.57 * (1 / 0.00008617) .

1 / 0.00008617 is approximately 11,600 (since 0.0001 is 10,000, 0.000086 is about 11,627? Let's see: 1 / 0.000086 ≈ 11,627.9 ). So 8.57 * 11,627.9 ≈ 8.57 * 11.6 thousand.

8 * 11.6k is 92.8k, 0.57 *11.6k≈ 6.6k. So total about 99.4k. So approximately 99,400 K.

Wait, wait, so [ΔE/(k)] ≈ 99,400 K.

So then, the term inside the exp is [99400 K] * [1/5500 - 1/6000] K^-1.

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818, and 1/6000≈0.000166667.

So 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 ≈ 0.000015151.

So 99400 * 0.000015151 ≈ approx 99400 * 1.5151e-5.

99400 * 1.5151e-5 = (99400) * (approx 0.000015151) = let's compute.

99400 * 0.000015151.

Let me compute 99400 * 0.000015151.

Multiply 99400 by 1.5151e-5.

Which is the same as 99400 * (1.5151 * 1e-5) ) = 99400 * 1.5151 * 1e-5.

Compute 99400 * 1.5151 = let me calculate:

99400 * 1.5 = 149,100.

99400 * 0.0151 = 99400 * 0.01 = 994; 0.0051 *99400 = 506.94; total 994 +506.94 = 1500.94.

So total is approximately 149,100 + 1500.94 = 150,600.94.

Multiply by 1e-5: 150,600.94e-5 = 15.060094.

So approximately 15.06.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a miscalculation here because 99400 * 1.5151e-5 is:

Let me think, 1e-5 is 0.00001. 99400 * 0.000015151.

Compute 99400 * 0.00001 = 0.994.

99400 * 0.000005151 = 99400 * 5.151e-6.

5.151e-6 is 0.000005151.

99400 * 5.151e-6 = (99400 *5.151) * 1e-6.

99400 *5 =497,000; 99400 *0.151=15,003.4. So total 512,003.4.

Multiply by 1e-6: 512,003.4e-6 = 0.5120034.

So adding 0.994 and 0.5120034 gives approximately 1.506.

So the term inside the exp is approximately 1.506.

So factor = exp(1.506) ≈ e^1.506.

I know that e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817. 1.506 is close to 1.5, so approx 4.48.

Wait, but let me compute e^1.506 more accurately.

e^1.506: since e^1.5 is approx 4.4817. Now, 1.506 is 1.5 + 0.006.

The derivative of e^x at x=1.5 is e^1.5 ≈4.4817.

So the linear approximation: e^(1.5 + 0.006) ≈ e^1.5 + 0.006 * e^1.5.

Which is 4.4817 + 0.006 * 4.4817 ≈4.4817 + 0.0269 ≈4.5086.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach:

1.506 = ln(4.5086) ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of known e^x.

Another approach: e^0.5 is about 1.6487. So e^1.5 is e^1 * e^0.5 ≈ 2.718 * 1.6487 ≈4.4817, which matches what I thought earlier.

But 1.506 is 0.006 above 1.5. So e^1.506 = e^1.5 * e^0.006.

e^0.006 ≈ 1 + 0.006 + (0.006)^2/2 ≈1.006018.

So 4.4817 * 1.006018 ≈4.4817 * 1.006 ≈4.510.

So the factor is approximately 4.51.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5 and option D is ~2.9, which is lower.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, wait, when the spots are present, the Teff is 5500 K. So in the denominator, the exponent is [ΔE/(k T_spotted)], which is higher than [ΔE/(k T_spotless)], because T is lower. So the ratio [n1/n2]_no_spots / [n1/n2]_with_spots is exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/T_spotted -1/T_spotless) ), which I computed as 1.506, leading to a factor of about 4.5.

So the factor is around 4.5, which is option C.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratio. When the star has spots, the Teff is 5500 K. So when the star has spots, the temperature is lower. So the ratio n1/n2 is lower for the spotted case. So when comparing (n1/n2)_no_spots to (n1/n2)_with_spots, the ratio is higher, which is why the factor is about 4.5.

So the correct answer would be option C, ~4.5.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from having no spots to having spots, we use the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{with spots}}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann equation into the factor expression, we find:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spotted}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{spotless}}}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Energy difference (\( \Delta E \))
The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). Using the relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Temperature terms
The effective temperatures are \( T_{\text{spotless}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spotted}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \). Compute the terms \( \frac{1}{T_{\text{spotted}}} \) and \( \frac{1}{T_{\text{spotless}}} \):

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{spotted}}} = \frac{1}{5500} \approx 0.0001818 \, \text{K}^{-1}, \quad \frac{1}{T_{\text{spotless}}} = \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001667 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

The difference is:

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{spotted}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{spotless}}} \approx 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.0000151 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 3: Boltzmann constant (\( k \))
The Boltzmann constant is \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \). The ratio \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} \) is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99,400 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the factor
Substitute into the factor expression:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(99,400 \times 0.0000151\right).
\]

Simplify the exponent:

\[
99,400 \times 0.0000151 \approx 1.506.
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.506) \approx 4.51.
\]

### Conclusion
The factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels changes is approximately **4.5**. This corresponds to option **C**.
