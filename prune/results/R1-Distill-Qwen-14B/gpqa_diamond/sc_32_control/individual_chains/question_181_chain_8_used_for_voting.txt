Okay, so I've got this physics question here about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino stuff, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. All other reactions are the same. We need to find the ratio of flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). Options are from A to D, with various ratios.

Wait, I remember that the pp chain is a major source of energy in the Sun. The pp-III branch is one of the steps. Oh right, the pp chain consists of several reactions. The main branches are pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. The pp-III branch is the dominant one, I think, producing a lot of helium-4 and some boron.

But if pp-III stops, what does that mean for neutrino production? Neutrinos are produced in specific reactions. In the Sun, the main neutrinos come from the decay of beryllium-7, which is part of the CNO cycle, but also from the pp chain. Specifically, the pp-I branch produces some neutrinos via the reaction where a boron-8 nucleus emits a positron and two neutrinos (I think that's the reaction: Beryllium-7 captures a proton to become Boron-8, which then decays into two protons and a positron, emitting neutrinos).

Wait, no, wait. The pp chain produces neutrinos in the pp-I branch. Let me get this right. Oh wait, the pp chain's main neutrino production is in the pp-I branch. Because the pp-III branch produces Beryllium-7, which then can go on to the CNO cycle or back to the pp chain. So if the pp-III branch stops, maybe that affects the flow of the pp chain reactions.

But the question says the pp-III branch stopped, not the entire pp chain. So let me think: the pp-III branch is part of the main energy producing cycle in the Sun. It produces helium-4 through a series of reactions, one of which is the capture of a proton by a helium-3 nucleus. So stopping this branch would reduce the production of helium, but more importantly, how does it affect the neutrino flux?

Wait, neutrinos in the Sun are mainly from the decay of Beryllium-7. So the production of Be-7 comes from the pp chain. If the pp-III branch stops, does that reduce the production of Be-7? Because Be-7 is formed in the pp chain, and the pp-III branch is the dominant one.

So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of Be-7 would drop. But wait, Be-7 is created in the pp chain reactions. So if pp-III is stopped, the production of Be-7 would be lower. But Be-7 has a half-life of around 53 days, I think. So if the production stopped 8.5 minutes ago, but the existing Be-7 would still decay. But since 8.5 minutes is much less than a day, perhaps the immediate effect is that the production of Be-7 stops, but the existing inventory might still be decaying.

Wait, but the question is about the neutrino flux. So neutrinos from Be-7 decay have a certain energy spectrum. The energy bands given are 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. So perhaps the flux in each band depends on the number of neutrinos emitted in those energy ranges.

Wait, but neutrinos from the pp chain—specifically, the pp-I branch—produce neutrinos with a certain energy. Let me recall: the pp-I branch involves the reaction 2H + 3H → 3He + ν. Wait, no, I think that's the wrong reaction. Let me think again. The pp-I reaction is: 

p + p → 2p + ν (but that's not quite right. Oh wait, it's the reaction where two protons collide, one emits a neutrino, and produces a deuteron (2H). Then the deuteron captures a proton to form 3H (tritium), which then undergoes beta decay. Or wait, the actual process is:

p + p → 2p + ν_e + e^+ ?

Wait, no, the correct reaction is that two protons (each a proton) collide, one emits a positron and a neutrino, and they form a deuteron. So the reaction is:

p + p → d + e+ + ν_e.

So that's the pp-I branch. This reaction produces neutrinos with a specific energy. The energy of the neutrino is determined by the Q-value of the reaction. The Q-value for this reaction is about 0.418 MeV. Because the mass of the deuteron is about 2.014 atomic mass units, and two protons are about 2.016 each. Wait, the exact calculation might be needed, but I think the neutrinos from the pp-I branch have energies on the order of 0.4 MeV, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no, let's clarify. The pp-I branch produces low-energy neutrinos, around ~0.4 MeV. The next branch, pp-II, produces higher energy neutrinos, and pp-III, even higher? Or is it the opposite?

Wait, the pp chain has three main branches:

1. pp-I: p + p → d + e+ + ν. This produces low-energy neutrinos (~0.4 MeV).
2. pp-II: p + p → d + e+ + ν, but then the d captures a proton to become 3H (tritium), which beta decays to 3He. Then 3He + p → 4He + gamma.
3. pp-III: This is the dominant branch, where 3He captures two protons in a series of reactions to form 4He. I'm not exactly sure about the neutrino production in the pp-III branch, but I think the dominant neutrinos come from the pp-I branch.

Wait, but I thought that the majority of solar neutrinos come from the CNO cycle via the decay of Be-7. Oh wait, no. Wait, the main neutrino flux from the Sun comes from the decay of Beryllium-7, which is part of the CNO cycle. The CNO cycle is responsible for about 91% of the Sun's energy production, and the pp chain for about 8%. But the pp chain is where the majority of the low-energy neutrinos come from (the so-called "pep" neutrinos from the pp-I branch), while the CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos via the decay of Be-7.

Wait, no. No, actually, I'm getting mixed up. The CNO cycle produces carbon-12 and nitrogen-14, and Be-7 is produced in the CNO cycle as part of the cycle. Be-7 then captures a proton to become Boron-8, which quickly decays into two protons and a positron, emitting two neutrinos. So the neutrinos from Be-7 decay are higher energy, around 1 MeV or more.

Wait, but the neutrinos from the pp chain (pp-I) are much lower energy (~0.4 MeV), and are called "pep" neutrinos. The CNO neutrinos are higher energy, around a few MeV. So if the pp-III branch stops, which part of the neutrino production is affected?

Wait, the pp-III branch is part of the pp chain, and if it stops, perhaps the production of Be-7 is affected? Or is the Be-7 production part of the CNO cycle, which is separate?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the two processes. The CNO cycle is a separate process from the proton-proton chain. The CNO cycle produces Be-7, which then decays into other isotopes, producing neutrinos. So the pp-III branch stopping would affect the pp chain, but not the CNO cycle. So the CNO neutrinos would continue unaffected.

Wait, but the question says that "all other reactions remained as they were." So if the pp-III branch stops, the pp chain's other branches might still proceed. So the pp-I and pp-II branches are still active, but the pp-III is not.

So neutrino production from the pp-I branch would still happen, but perhaps the pp-III branch contributes to other parts of the neutrino flux. Or perhaps the pp-III branch affects the overall abundance of certain isotopes, which in turn affects the neutrino production.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is the main one for producing He-4, so stopping it would affect the overall fusion rate. But I'm not sure how that would directly affect the neutrino flux in specific energy bands.

Wait, the question is about the flux ratio between two specific bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So both bands are in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range. If the pp chain's pp-III branch stops, which part of the neutrino spectrum is affected.

If the pp chain is producing neutrinos around 0.4 MeV (pp-I), and the CNO cycle produces higher energy neutrinos (like around 1.4 MeV or so?), then stopping the pp-III branch wouldn't directly affect the CNO neutrinos. So perhaps the neutrino flux in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range is due to the pp chain's pp-II branch.

Wait, the pp-II branch: let me think. The pp-II branch involves the deuteron capturing a proton to become a triton (3H), which then undergoes beta decay to 3He. Then, the 3He can capture a proton to form 4He. The neutrinos in this process would come from the beta decay of 3H, which is part of the pp-II branch. The energy of these neutrinos might be higher than the pep neutrinos from pp-I.

The pep neutrinos (pp-I) are about 0.4 MeV. The pp-II branch's neutrinos would have a higher energy. Or maybe the same? Because the beta decay is the same reaction as in pp-I. So perhaps the neutrinos from pp-II would have similar energies to those from pp-I.

Wait, but if the pp-III branch stops, the main pp chain is affected. But I'm not entirely sure how that impacts the production of Be-7 or the CNO neutrinos.

Wait, but if the pp-III branch is stopped, the production of He-4 via that branch would stop. But Be-7 is part of the CNO cycle, which is a separate process. So perhaps the CNO neutrinos are not affected. But the question is about neutrino flux in the 700-800 and 800-900 keV ranges. Let me think about the energy spectra.

The CNO neutrinos (from Be-7 decay) have higher energies, around 1.5-2 MeV or so. So the bands in question (0.7-0.9 MeV) are lower than that. So perhaps the neutrinos in those bands are from the pp chain, specifically pp-I or pp-II.

Wait, but the pp-I neutrinos are about 0.4 MeV. So 0.7-0.9 MeV is higher than that. So perhaps it's from the pp-II branch. Let me think about the neutrino energies from the pp-II branch.

The pp-II branch involves reactions where a deuteron (2H) captures a proton to form 3H (tritium). The beta decay of 3H (which is part of the pp-II branch) would emit a neutrino. The beta decay of 3H to 3He + e+ + ν. The Q-value for this reaction is the mass difference between 3H and 3He. 3H has a mass of about 3.01605 u, and 3He is about 3.01603 u. So the mass difference is about 0.00002 u, which is about 23 keV. So the maximum energy of the neutrino would be about 23 keV. But wait, that's way lower than the 0.7-0.9 MeV range. So that can't be.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range are from another process. Or perhaps the question is about the overall neutrino flux, which includes both CNO and pp chain contributions.

Wait, but the CNO neutrinos are higher energy, around 1.4 MeV (the neutrinos from Be-7 decay), so the 0.7-0.9 MeV range would be dominated by pp chain neutrinos. But the pp-I neutrinos are at ~0.4 MeV. So how do we get neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Another source of neutrinos is the decay of 7Be, which is part of the CNO cycle. So 7Be captures a proton to form 8B, which then decays into two protons and a positron, emitting two neutrinos. Each neutrino has an energy around 1.4 MeV. So perhaps that's the main source of higher-energy neutrinos.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio when the pp-III branch is stopped. If the pp-III branch stops, what happens to the pp chain's overall production?

If the pp-III branch is the dominant part of the pp chain, stopping it would reduce the production of He-4, but perhaps the pp-I and pp-II branches can still proceed. So the neutrinos from pp-I and pp-II would continue, but the overall rate might change.

Wait, but the question is about the flux ratio between two specific energy bands. If the pp-III branch stops, perhaps the production of He-4 is reduced, but not directly affecting the neutrino flux in those specific bands. Alternatively, maybe the flux in higher energy bands is more affected than lower ones.

Wait, but the pp-I neutrinos are at ~0.4 MeV, and the pp-II maybe a bit higher. Let me think again: the pp-I reaction produces a neutrino with energy about 0.4 MeV. The pp-II branch, which involves 3H beta decay, produces a neutrino with about 23 keV. So these are much lower energy. But the 0.7-0.9 MeV range is higher than both, so perhaps the only explanation is that these neutrinos come from another source.

Wait, wait, so perhaps the pp-III branch contributes to the neutrino flux in higher energy bands. Let's think. The pp-III branch leads to the production of 3He, then captures a proton to form 4He. But in that process, does it produce any neutrinos? Or are all the neutrinos from the pp chain's pp-I and pp-II branches?

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the neutrino flux from the Sun. The main sources are the pep (pp-I) neutrinos (~0.4 MeV) and the CNO neutrinos (~1.4 MeV). But are there any other neutrino sources?

Wait, there's also the Boron neutrinos from the CNO cycle. The 8B decay produces two neutrinos, each around 1.4 MeV. So the main neutrino energies are around 0.4 MeV and 1.4 MeV.

So the flux in the 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV) and 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV) bands must be caused by some other process.

Wait, but 0.7 MeV is higher than the pep neutrinos. Could it be due to the presence of other reactions, like the decay of other isotopes?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that the pp chain produces a continuous spectrum of neutrinos, not just a single energy. But wait, the pp-I reaction produces a mono-energetic neutrino, or a distribution?

Wait, the pp-I reaction: p + p → d + e+ + ν. The Q-value is about 0.418 MeV. So the maximum energy of the neutrino is 0.418 MeV. But since the neutrino has a small energy compared to the rest mass, the neutrino's energy is actually a small fraction of the Q-value. So the neutrinos from the pp-I branch have a spectrum peaking around 0.4 MeV, but with a spread.

Similarly, the pp-II branch's neutrinos (from 3H decay) have a much lower energy, around 23 keV, as I thought earlier.

Wait, but then where does the 0.7-0.9 MeV neutrino flux come from? It's higher than the pp-I neutrinos but lower than the CNO neutrinos. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch produces some high-energy neutrinos. Let me think about the reactions in the pp-III branch. The pp-III branch starts with 3He capturing two protons to form 5Li, which then decays into 4He and a deuteron. But I don't think any neutrinos are emitted in that process. So perhaps the pp-III branch doesn't produce neutrinos directly.

Hmm, maybe the question is more about the overall neutrino flux from different sources. If the pp-III branch stops, then the production of 3He via the pp chain is reduced. But 3He can also be produced via other means, like in the CNO cycle. But I'm not sure how that affects the neutrino flux in the specified bands.

Wait, but if the pp-III branch stopped, that would mean that less 3He is produced via the pp chain. But the CNO cycle produces 3He as part of its cycle, so maybe the overall 3He abundance isn't immediately affected. But if the question is about the neutrino production, perhaps the CNO neutrinos are unaffected, but the pp chain's neutrinos are affected.

Wait, but the CNO neutrinos are produced via the decay of 8B, which is part of the CNO cycle. So if the pp-III branch stops, but the CNO cycle continues, then the CNO neutrinos would continue as before. So the neutrino flux in the 1.4 MeV range (CNO) would remain the same, but the lower-energy neutrinos from the pp chain would be affected.

But the question is about the ratio of two bands, 700-800 and 800-900 keV. So these are in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range. If the main source of neutrinos in this range is the pp chain, then perhaps the ratio depends on whether the pp chain's production is affected.

Wait, but I'm still not clear on why the 0.7-0.9 MeV range would have neutrinos. The pp chain's main neutrinos are at ~0.4 MeV (pep) and ~23 keV (from pp-II). The CNO neutrinos are at ~1.4 MeV. So I'm confused about the origin of neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick question because the neutrinos in those bands are from somewhere else. Or maybe I'm missing a point about the flux ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the solar neutrino flux in general. If the pp-III branch stops, the overall fusion rate in the pp chain decreases, which would affect the production of Be-7? Wait, no, Be-7 is part of the CNO cycle. So if the pp chain stops, it doesn't directly affect the CNO production. So the CNO neutrinos would remain the same.

Wait, but the pp chain's neutrinos would decrease. So the lower-energy neutrinos (0.4 MeV) would decrease in flux, but the higher-energy (1.4 MeV) would remain the same. Therefore, in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range, which is between the two main neutrino energies, the flux would be dominated by the pp chain's contribution. But wait, the pp chain's neutrinos are at 0.4 MeV and 23 keV, so in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range, they might not contribute much.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the neutrino flux in the Sun's spectrum. The solar neutrino spectrum has a peak around 0.4 MeV (pep), then another peak around 1.4 MeV (CNO). So between 0.7 and 1.4 MeV, the flux is lower. So the 0.7-0.9 MeV range is a region where the flux is minimal, perhaps more from the pp chain's higher-energy tails.

Wait, but the pp chain's neutrinos are around 0.4 MeV and 23 keV, so the 0.7-0.9 MeV range would have very few neutrinos from the pp chain. So perhaps the main neutrino flux in that range is from the CNO cycle, but that's at 1.4 MeV.

Wait, perhaps the question is implying that the CNO neutrinos are the main contributors beyond 1 MeV, and the pp chain's neutrinos are below 0.5 MeV. Therefore, the flux in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range is much lower than in the CNO range.

But the question is about the ratio after the pp-III branch stops. If the pp-III branch stops, but the CNO cycle continues, then the CNO neutrinos are unaffected, but the pp chain's neutrinos are reduced.

Wait, but the bands are 700-800 and 800-900 keV. So both are between 0.7 and 0.9 MeV. If the pp-III branch stops, which affects the pp chain's production, but not the CNO, then perhaps the neutrinos in those bands are from the pp chain's higher-energy reactions, which would be reduced.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is responsible for producing higher-energy neutrinos beyond 0.4 MeV. But I'm not certain about that.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch produces neutrinos via the 3He + p → 4He + gamma reaction, but I don't think that process emits any neutrinos. So that might not contribute to the neutrino flux.

Another approach: If the pp-III branch stops, what fraction of the total neutrino flux is affected?

Assuming that the majority of the neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range come from the pp chain, and the pp-III branch is a major contributor to the pp chain's neutrinos, then stopping it would significantly reduce the flux in band 1 and band 2.

But wait, in the scenario where the pp-III branch stops, the pp chain's overall production decreases. So the number of neutrinos from the pp chain would decrease, but the CNO neutrinos would stay the same.

So if band 1 is 700-800 keV and band 2 is 800-900 keV, and both are in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range, which is higher than the 0.4 MeV of the pep neutrinos, perhaps the flux in these bands is from a different source, perhaps not affected by the pp chain.

Wait, but if the pp chain's neutrinos are mostly around 0.4 MeV, then the 0.7-0.9 MeV bands would have negligible contribution from the pp chain. Therefore, the flux in those bands would be due to the CNO neutrinos, which are unaffected by the pp chain's status. So the ratio would be 1, because both bands are dominated by CNO neutrinos, which are unchanged.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the CNO neutrinos are at 1.4 MeV, so the 0.7-0.9 MeV bands are in the region where there are very few neutrinos. So the flux in these bands would be very low.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of flux between these two bands. If both bands are in a region where the flux is low but similar, then the ratio would be about 1.

So, in that case, the ratio would be approximately 1, so option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrino flux in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range is zero, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, but the question specifies that the pp-III branch stopped, but all others remained the same. So if the CNO neutrinos are unaffected, and the pp chain's neutrinos are reduced, but their main contribution is at lower energies, then the flux in 0.7-0.9 MeV would be dominated by CNO, which is the same.

But I'm getting stuck. Another angle: the solar neutrino flux has a peak at ~0.4 MeV (pep), then much lower in the 0.7 MeV region, then a peak at ~1.4 MeV (CNO). So the flux in 0.7-0.9 MeV is lower than both.

If the pp-III branch stops, the pp chain's neutrino production goes down. So the flux in the ~0.4 MeV region would drop, but the 0.7-0.9 MeV bands would be affected only if that region is mostly from the pp chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the 0.7-0.9 MeV neutrinos are from the pp chain's higher-energy processes. If the pp-III branch stops, those would stop, leading to a lower flux in that region.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact energy distribution. Alternatively, let's think about the relative contributions of the pp chain and CNO cycle to the solar neutrino flux.

The CNO cycle contributes about 90% of the Sun's energy, so their neutrinos make up a significant part of the flux. The pp chain contributes about 8%, so their neutrinos are fewer. So if the pp-III branch stops, the pp chain's contribution is reduced, but the CNO neutrinos remain the same.

So, in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range, which is between the 0.4 MeV and 1.4 MeV, the flux would be dominated by the CNO neutrinos. So the ratio of flux between band 1 and band 2 would be close to 1.

But wait, in reality, the neutrino spectrum in that mid-energy range isn't that high. Let me think about the actual solar neutrino flux. From what I remember, the flux has a peak at around 0.4 MeV, then it decreases until about 1 MeV, and then increases again at 1.4 MeV. So the flux in 0.7-0.9 MeV is lower than at 0.4, but higher than at higher energies beyond 1.4 MeV.

But if the CNO neutrinos are at 1.4 MeV, then the neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range are from the pp chain, but due to the tail of their distribution.

If the pp-III branch stops, the pp chain's neutrino flux would decrease. So the neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 MeV bands, which are part of the pp chain's spectrum, would decrease. But wait, the CNO neutrinos are at higher energy, so they wouldn't be affected. So the 0.7-0.9 MeV flux would be from the pp chain, which is reduced.

But the question is about the ratio of the two bands. Since both are in the same energy range, perhaps the ratio remains about the same as before, which was a ratio of 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp chain's neutrinos have a harder spectrum, meaning higher average energy, so the ratio could be something else.

Wait, but I'm getting too stuck. Let me try to think of another approach. Let's consider that the pp chain's neutrinos are only in the lower energy part (pep) and the higher energy part perhaps via other processes.

If the pp-III branch stopped, which is a major part of the pp chain, then the production of neutrinos from the pp chain would drop.

So, the neutrino flux in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range would be from the pp chain. If the pp chain is producing less, then the flux in both bands would drop proportionally. So the ratio would stay the same.

But I'm not sure about the energy distribution of the pp chain's neutrinos. Alternatively, perhaps the 0.7-0.9 MeV range is part of the pp chain's spectrum, and if the pp-III branch stops, the flux in this range is reduced, but the same proportionally in both bands.

In that case, the ratio would stay the same, which would be option C, 1.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another possibility is that the pp-III branch doesn't contribute to neutrino production, so stopping it doesn't affect the neutrino flux. In that case, the flux ratio would remain the same, which would be 1.

Alternatively, maybe the flux in the 0.7-0.9 MeV bands is entirely from the pp chain, and stopping the pp-III branch would reduce it. But since both bands are in the same range, the ratio would remain 1.

So perhaps the answer is C) 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves analyzing the ratio of neutrino flux between two energy bands, 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2), under the hypothetical scenario where the pp-III branch of the proton-proton (pp) chain in the Sun's core suddenly stops, while all other reactions remain unchanged. The key points of analysis are as follows:

1. **Neutrino Sources in the Sun**:  
   - The Sun's neutrino flux is primarily composed of two types:  
     - **Low-energy neutrinos (~0.4 MeV)** from the pp-I branch of the pp chain (pep neutrinos).  
     - **High-energy neutrinos (~1.4 MeV)** from the CNO cycle, specifically the decay of $^{8}\text{B}$ in the $^{7}\text{Be} + p \rightarrow ^{8}\text{B} \rightarrow 2p + e^+ + \nu$ process.  

2. **Energy Bands in Question**:  
   - The bands 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV) and 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV) fall between the energy ranges of the pep neutrinos (~0.4 MeV) and the CNO neutrinos (~1.4 MeV). This intermediate energy range is not directly associated with either the pep neutrinos or the CNO neutrinos.  

3. **Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch**:  
   - The pp-III branch is a major contributor to the pp chain's energy production and helium-4 synthesis. However, the neutrino flux from the pp chain is primarily associated with the pp-I branch (pep neutrinos) at ~0.4 MeV. The pp-II branch contributes neutrinos at much lower energies (~23 keV).  
   - Since the pp-III branch does not directly produce neutrinos, its sudden stoppage would not significantly affect the neutrino flux in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range.  

4. **Flux Ratio Analysis**:  
   - The neutrino flux in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range is already very low compared to the pep and CNO neutrinos. The pp-III branch's stoppage would not alter the flux in this range, as it is not a major source of neutrinos.  
   - Therefore, the ratio of flux between the two bands (0.7-0.8 MeV and 0.8-0.9 MeV) would remain approximately 1, as both bands are similarly affected (or unaffected) by the stoppage of the pp-III branch.  

5. **Conclusion**:  
   - The flux ratio between the two energy bands is dominated by the neutrino spectrum in the Sun, which is unaffected by the stoppage of the pp-III branch in the given energy range. Thus, the ratio is approximately 1.

Answer: C
