Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says there's an operator P with components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these has a matrix form given. The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The explicit state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). And the question is asking for the uncertainty ΔPz of the Pz operator.

Hmm. Right, the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So for Pz, I need to find ⟨Pz⟩ and ⟨Pz²⟩, then take the square root of their difference.

Wait, but wait. Since the system is in an eigenstate of Px, it's not necessarily an eigenstate of Pz. So measuring Pz will have some uncertainty. 

First, I should probably find the expectation value of Pz, ⟨Pz⟩. To do that, I need to compute the state vector multiplied by Pz matrix, then take the inner product. Or, more formally, ⟨ψ| Pz |ψ⟩.

The state vector ψ is given as a column vector:

ψ = [ -1/2
       1/√2
       -1/2 ]

So, I need to compute ψ† Pz ψ.

Looking at the Pz matrix:

Pz is a 3x3 matrix where the first row is [ħ, 0, 0], second row [0, 0, 0], third row [0, 0, -ħ].

So the matrix is diagonal, right? So to compute Pz times ψ, it's straightforward because each component just multiplies the corresponding component of ψ.

Wait, so let's compute ψ† Pz ψ.

Each component of ψ is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of Pz.

So, the first component is (-1/2) * ħ, the second component is (1/sqrt(2)) * 0, and the third component is (-1/2) * (-ħ).

So adding them up: (-1/2 ħ) + 0 + (1/2 ħ) = 0. Wait, that can't be right. Because (-1/2 ħ) + (1/2 ħ) is zero. So ⟨Pz⟩ is zero?

But wait a minute, let me make sure I did that correctly. The state vector is ( -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ). Pz is diagonal with elements ħ, 0, -ħ.

So when you multiply Pz by ψ, each component is:

First component: (ħ)(-1/2) = -ħ/2

Second component: 0 * (1/√2) = 0

Third component: (-ħ) * (-1/2) = ħ/2

So the product Pzψ is a vector ( -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 )

Now, the expectation value ⟨Pz⟩ is ψ† Pz ψ. So take the conjugate transpose of ψ (which is the same as ψ since the elements are real?), dot product with Pzψ.

Wait, ψ is a column vector with real elements, so the conjugate transpose is just the transpose, [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]

So the inner product would be:

( -1/2 ) * ( -ħ/2 ) + (1/√2) * 0 + ( -1/2 ) * ( ħ/2 )

Let's compute each term:

First term: (-1/2)(-ħ/2) = ħ/4

Second term: 0

Third term: (-1/2)(ħ/2) = -ħ/4

Adding them together: ħ/4 + 0 - ħ/4 = 0.

So yes, ⟨Pz⟩ is zero. That's interesting.

Now, I need ⟨Pz²⟩. Since Pz is diagonal, Pz squared will have the squares of the diagonal elements. So the diagonal entries are (ħ)^2, 0^2, (-ħ)^2 → ħ², 0, ħ².

So Pz² matrix is:

[ ħ², 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, ħ² ]

So, to find ⟨Pz²⟩, it's ψ† Pz² ψ.

Again, compute Pz² multiplied by ψ, then take the inner product with ψ.

Calculating Pz² ψ:

First component: ħ² * (-1/2)
Second component: 0 * (1/√2) = 0
Third component: ħ² * (-1/2)

So, Pz² ψ is [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ]

Now, the inner product ψ† Pz² ψ is:

( -1/2 ) * (-ħ²/2 ) + (1/√2)(0) + ( -1/2 ) * (-ħ²/2 )

Each term:

First term: (1/2)(1/2) ħ² = ħ²/4

Third term: (1/2)(1/2) ħ² = ħ²/4

Adding them: ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So ⟨Pz²⟩ is ħ²/2.

Now, the uncertainty formula is sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²).

⟨Pz⟩ is zero, so ⟨Pz⟩² is zero. So uncertainty ΔPz is sqrt(ħ²/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) sqrt(2)ħ → which is about 1.414 ħ.

B) ħ / sqrt(2) → approx 0.707 ħ.

C) ħ/2 → 0.5 ħ.

D) ħ → 1 ħ.

So option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which would be our answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.

Let me double-check the steps:

1. ⟨Pz⟩ = 0 → Correct.

2. Pz² matrix is diagonal with elements (ħ², 0, ħ²). So when multiplied by ψ, the components are (-ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ). 

Wait wait! Wait a second, this seems off. Because the third component of ψ is -1/2, and Pz squared's third component is ħ². So Pz² ψ's third component is (ħ²)*(-1/2) = -ħ²/2. So the vector is [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ].

But when you take the inner product with ψ (which is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]), each component is multiplied by the corresponding component of Pz²ψ.

So, ψ is [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]

So:

-1/2 * (-ħ²/2) = (1/2)(1/2) ħ² = ħ²/4

1/sqrt(2) * 0 = 0

-1/2 * (-ħ²/2) = (1/2)(1/2) ħ² = ħ²/4

Adding these, ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2 → correct.

So yes, ⟨Pz²⟩ is ħ²/2, and since ⟨Pz⟩ is zero, the uncertainty is sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

So the answer should be option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state vector is given as:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The $P_z$ matrix is diagonal with elements $(\hbar, 0, -\hbar)$:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute $\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi$, we calculate:

\[
P_z \psi = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 0 \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, take the inner product $\langle \psi | P_z \psi \rangle$:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(-\frac{\hbar}{2}) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} + 0 - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The $P_z^2$ matrix is diagonal with elements $(\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2)$:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi$, we calculate:

\[
P_z^2 \psi = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \\ 0 \\ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, take the inner product $\langle \psi | P_z^2 \psi \rangle$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\right).
\]

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the uncertainty formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, we have:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
