Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian L(y) = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think I remember that the Lagrangian describes the interaction terms in the Standard Model. So, the boson X is interacting with fermions f through this term.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to find the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different possible fermion pairs.

Wait, kinematically allowed means that the decay products have to have enough energy to satisfy energy and momentum conservation, and also that the rest mass of the products is less than the mass of X. Because for a decay to happen, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the decaying particle. So, X can decay into particles whose combined rest mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Looking at the fermions, I think fermions come in pairs because the decay would produce a particle and its antiparticle. So for each decay channel, like X→f f̄, the rest mass of f must be less than or equal to 6 GeV/2, since two particles are being created.

Wait, no, wait. Because when the boson X decays, it's at rest (assuming it's the rest frame), so the energy available is its mass. For the decay into two particles, each fermion would have a mass m_f. So each fermion's mass must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Wait, no, because the total mass for the pair would be 2m_f, but since the X is at rest, the energy available is 6 GeV. So the maximum possible mass for each fermion is 6 GeV, but realistically, since each fermion has mass m_f, 2m_f <= 6 GeV → m_f <= 3 GeV. Hmm, wait, no, that's not right. Because each particle and antiparticle have the same mass. So for a decay into a pair, each must be less than or equal to 3 GeV, because 2 times 3 is 6.

Wait, but wait another thought. If X is at rest, and it decays into two particles, each must have energy. But the rest mass of each is m_f. The total energy of each is E = sqrt(p²c^4 + m_f^2 c^4). But the sum of the energies is the mass of X, which is 6 GeV. So when X decays into two fermions, each must have E_f >= m_f. So for decay to be possible, the sum of their rest masses must be <= 6 GeV. But for two particles, each has mass m_f, so 2m_f <= 6 GeV → m_f <= 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait, that's only if the fermions are non-relativistic, but in reality, when a particle decays, the energy can be distributed as needed as long as conservation laws are satisfied. To create a pair, each must have energy at least their rest mass. So the sum of their rest masses must be ≤ the mass of X. So, for X→f f̄, 2m_f ≤ m_X. Since m_X is 6 GeV, each fermion must have m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So I need to list all fermions with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait, the fermions in the Standard Model include quarks and leptons. Let me think about their masses. 

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. Their masses are (approximate):

Up: ~2 MeV
Down: ~4 MeV
Strange: ~100 MeV
Charm: ~1.5 GeV
Bottom: ~4.5 GeV
Top: ~173 GeV

Leptons: electron, muon, tau, and their neutrinos. Neutrinos have very tiny masses, but for charged leptons:

Electron: ~0.5 MeV
Muon: ~105 MeV
Tau: ~1.78 GeV

So, the fermions with mass ≤ 3 GeV are:

Quarks: u, d, s, c. Because charm is about 1.5 GeV, which is under 3 GeV. Bottom is 4.5, which is over.

Leptons: e, mu, tau. Tau is about 1.78 GeV, which is under 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait, neutrinos are also fermions, but their masses are negligible. So, can X decay into neutrinos? The problem gives the interaction Lagrangian, which includes (v + X(y)) times psi_f. So, if the fermion is a neutrino, they would have to be part of the interaction. But since the Lagrangian is written in terms of ψ_f, which I think refers to Dirac spinors, including charged leptons and quarks. But wait, neutrinos are left-handed in the Standard Model, and they don't have a right-handed counterpart, so the interaction term might not include them unless there's a Majorana mass term, which isn't part of the Standard Model. So perhaps the interaction here doesn't involve neutrinos, because in the Standard Model, neutrinos don't have a mass term from the Higgs.

So, the possible decay products are quarks (u, d, s, c, maybe b if its possible) and leptons (e, mu, tau) and their antiparticles.

Wait, but wait, the mass of the X is 6 GeV. So for each decay into a fermion-antifermion pair:

Each fermion's mass must be ≤ 3 GeV. So let's list which fermions have m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

Quarks:
u: 2 MeV → yes
d: 4 MeV → yes
s: ~100 MeV → yes
c: ~1.5 GeV → yes
b: ~4.5 GeV → no (since 4.5 >3)
t: way beyond, but irrelevant.

Leptons:
e: 0.5 MeV → yes
mu: 105 MeV → yes (~0.105 GeV)
tau: 1.78 GeV → yes (since 1.78 ≤3)

So X can decay into any of these fermion pairs. So possible decay channels are:

uū, dđ, sš, cč, e+e-, mu+mu-, tau+tau-, and same for quarks.

Wait, but in the options, the decay options are listed, and I need to see which include the correct possible pairs.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

But wait, the b quark has a mass of 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar, because each b is 4.5 GeV, so 2*4.5=9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So option A includes b bbar, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So c is 1.5 GeV, which is allowed. Tau is 1.78 GeV, allowed. Mu is 0.105 GeV, allowed. So all these fermions are allowed. So B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So these are all possible fermions with m_f ≤3 GeV.

Option C: X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, the top quark has a mass of about 173 GeV, so that's way above 3 GeV. So X can't decay into t tbar. So option C is wrong because it includes t.

Option D: X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Again, includes b, which is too heavy.

So the correct option is B. Because B includes all the allowed fermions: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e, and their antiparticles.

Wait, but wait a minute. What about the charm quark? Its mass is about 1.5 GeV, which is less than 3, so allowed. So the decay X→c cbar is allowed. So option B is correct.

But let me double-check: option B includes c cbar, which is allowed, and all the others.

Wait, option B: "X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-"

Yes, all these fermion pairs have masses under 3 GeV, so allowed.

So the correct answer should be option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction between \( X \) and fermions is described by the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y).
\]

For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the rest mass of each fermion \( f \) must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq m_X \), where \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This implies \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). The fermion masses in the Standard Model are as follows:

- Quarks: \( u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV}, \, d \approx 4 \, \text{MeV}, \, s \approx 100 \, \text{MeV}, \, c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV}, \, b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV}, \, t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \),
- Leptons: \( e \approx 0.5 \, \text{MeV}, \, \mu \approx 105 \, \text{MeV}, \, \tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \).

From these, the fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are \( u, d, s, c, e, \mu, \tau \). Neutrinos are excluded because their masses are negligible, and the interaction Lagrangian does not include neutrinos in the Standard Model.

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden because \( m_b = 4.5 \, \text{GeV} > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, A is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which have \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is forbidden because \( m_t = 173 \, \text{GeV} \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, C is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden for the same reason as in A. Hence, D is incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decay channels for \( X \) at the lowest order.
