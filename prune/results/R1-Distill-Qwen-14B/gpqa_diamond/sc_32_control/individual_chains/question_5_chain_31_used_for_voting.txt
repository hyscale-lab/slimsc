Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator P is given with its X, Y, and Z components. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, these look familiar. I think they're the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. Let me write them down:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator P is along some arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Wait, the x-z plane means the direction vector n has components (nx, 0, nz), right? Because y-component is zero. So the direction is arbitrary but in x-z.

The operator P is given as a vector operator, so P = nx P_x + nz P_z + 0*P_y, since n is in x-z. So the operator along n is P = n·σ * (ħ/2), where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices. 

Wait, the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P.

Alternatively, since P is (n·σ)(ħ/2), the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. So the eigenvector we want is the one with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

I remember that the eigenstates of a Pauli matrix along a direction n are |+> and |->, which are given by specific superpositions of the basis vectors.

Wait, the general formula for the eigenstates: For a direction n with unit vector (a, b, c), the eigenstates are |+> = (a + i b, c + ...). Wait, perhaps I should think about the explicit form. 

Wait, the eigenvectors for the spin operator in direction (n_x, n_y, n_z) are given by:

|+> = ( (n_x + i n_y), n_z + 1 )^(1/2) ) ... wait, maybe not. Alternatively, I think the eigenvectors can be written in terms of the angles theta and phi. Oh, because n is in the x-z plane, so phi is zero? Or wait, no, in the x-z plane, the direction has zero y-component, so phi is 90 degrees or something?

Wait, no, when the direction is in the x-z plane, the polar angle theta is measured from the z-axis, and phi is zero because it's in the x-z plane (azimuthal angle is zero). So phi = 0. 

So the unit vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

So the spin-up state (eigenvalue +ħ/2) along this direction would be:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |↑> - i sin(θ/2) |↓>

Wait, no. Let me think again. The standard eigenstates for spin-1/2 along a direction (n_x, n_y, n_z) are given by:

|+> = [ [n_x + i n_y], n_z + 1 ]^(1/2) ]^T multiplied by some normalization factor.

Wait, let's get back to basics. The operator P is (n · σ) * (ħ/2), so the matrix is (n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]]) ) * (ħ/2). So the matrix P is ( (n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]]) + (n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]]) ) * (ħ/2).

But since the direction is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero, so P simplifies to [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] * (ħ/2).

Wait, because n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1. So n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, perhaps? Because for a direction in the x-z plane, the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis. So n_z = cosθ, n_x = sinθ.

So P becomes (ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ].

Wait, but maybe I should write the matrix more precisely. The matrix for P would be:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Which, substituting n_z = cosθ and n_x = sinθ, becomes:

(ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

The eigenvalues of this matrix are ±(ħ/2), as expected.

To find the eigenvectors, I'll solve (P - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0, for the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So (P - (ħ/2) I) would be:

(ħ/2) * [ [cosθ - 1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

Wait, no: P is (ħ/2) * the matrix, so when subtracting (ħ/2) I, each diagonal element is (ħ/2)*(cosθ) - (ħ/2) * 1 = (ħ/2)(cosθ -1), and similarly for the others.

So the matrix becomes:

[[ (ħ/2)(cosθ -1), (ħ/2) sinθ ],
[ (ħ/2) sinθ, (ħ/2)(-cosθ -1) ] ]

But since (ħ/2) is a common factor, I can factor it out:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ -1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

So the equation (P - (ħ/2) I)|v> = 0 is:

[ [cosθ -1, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ] * [v1; v2] = 0

So we have the equations:

(cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0

sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 = 0

Let me write the first equation:

(cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0

I can solve for v2 in terms of v1.

v2 = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] v1

Hmm, wait, let me compute (cosθ -1) = - (1 - cosθ), so:

- (1 - cosθ) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0 → sinθ v2 = (1 - cosθ) v1 → v2 = [ (1 - cosθ)/sinθ ] v1

Wait, (1 - cosθ)/sinθ is equal to tan(θ/2). Because I remember that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] ) = tan(θ/2).

So v2 = tan(θ/2) v1.

So the eigenvector can be written as [v1; tan(θ/2) v1 ] = v1 [1; tan(θ/2) ]

We can choose v1 = 1 for simplicity, but we'll need to normalize the vector.

So the vector is [1, tan(theta/2)].

Wait, but let me compute the normalization factor.

The vector is |v> = [1; tan(theta/2)].

The norm squared is 1^2 + [tan(theta/2)]^2 = 1 + tan²(theta/2) ) = sec²(theta/2) ) = 1 / cos²(theta/2)

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(1 + tan²(theta/2)) ) = cos(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, because when you compute [1; tan(theta/2)] multiplied by cos(theta/2), you get [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, let me see: 1 * cos(theta/2) = cos(theta/2), and tan(theta/2) * cos(theta/2) = [ sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2) ] * cos(theta/2) = sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T.

Wait, but wait! The question gives the operator P as nx P_x + nz P_z, right?

Alternatively, another approach: since the eigenvector is along the direction n, which is in the x-z plane. So for spin-1/2, the spin-up state in direction n is given by:

|+> = [ e^{-i phi/2} cos(theta/2), e^{i phi/2} sin(theta/2) ]

But since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is zero. Because phi is the azimuthal angle, which is the angle around the z-axis. If the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is 0. So e^{-i phi/2} = 1, and e^{i phi/2} =1.

So the eigenvector simplifies to [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

Wait, the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D: sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2) → but wait, no hbar in the eigenvectors, because eigenvectors are dimensionless.

Wait, no, the vectors given in the options A and D have hbar, but eigenvectors shouldn't have units like hbar. So perhaps that's a mistake in the options. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) hbar, sqrt(1/3) hbar )

But eigenvectors are dimensionless, but maybe the options have a typo, perhaps the hbar is a mistake, or perhaps it's part of the vector's components? That seems unlikely. So probably, the correct normalized vector would have components without hbar. So perhaps the options have a mistake, but looking again, I think the correct answer is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which seems to match.

Wait, but let me think again. Because in the problem statement, the components are given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So for the operator P, which is (n·σ)(ħ/2). So the eigenvectors are spinors, which are vectors in a 2D Hilbert space. So their components are complex numbers (possibly zero imaginary parts in this case), but the options C and others don't have any imaginary components, so maybe that's correct.

Wait, but I should also consider the form of the eigenvectors. The eigenvector we found is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T. So the components are real, which matches option C.

Wait, but option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which looks like spherical harmonics but for a vector; but since phi is zero in our case, it would be (cos(theta), sin(theta)), but that's the vector on the Bloch sphere, but the eigenvector for spin-up is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the parametrization confused.

Wait, another approach: the eigenstates of S·n are (|+> and |->), where |+> is the spin-up along n. The state can be expressed as:

|+> = e^{-i phi/2} cos(theta/2) |↑> + e^{i phi/2} sin(theta/2) |↓>

Since in our case, phi is zero (because n is in the x-z plane), this simplifies to:

|+> = cos(theta/2) |↑> + sin(theta/2) |↓>

Which in component form (using |↑> = [1, 0]^T and |↓> = [0, 1]^T) becomes:

|+> = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T

So that's the normalized eigenvector. Therefore, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, the question says the eigenvector is normalized. So the options should present the normalized version. So option C is the correct one.

The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices scaled by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ is in the x-z plane, so $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle measured from the z-axis.

The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is expressed as:

\[
\vec{P} = \vec{n} \cdot \vec{\sigma} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where $\vec{\sigma}$ represents the Pauli matrices. Substituting $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, the matrix form of $\vec{P}$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation $\vec{P} | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle$ is solved to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The normalized eigenvector for spin-up along $\vec{n}$ is given by:

\[
|+\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This result is derived from the standard eigenstates of the spin operator along an arbitrary direction, simplified for the case where $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane (azimuthal angle $\phi = 0$). The eigenvector is normalized, as the components $\cos(\theta/2)$ and $\sin(\theta/2)$ satisfy the normalization condition.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ includes $\hbar$, which is inconsistent with the normalization of eigenvectors (dimensionless quantities). This is incorrect.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ corresponds to spherical harmonics but does not match the spin-up eigenvector for $\phi = 0$. This is incorrect.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived normalized eigenvector for spin-up along $\vec{n}$. This is correct.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ includes $\hbar$ and incorrect normalization coefficients. This is incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**.
