Okay, so I need to figure out what Compound X is and then determine what it becomes after reacting with red phosphorus and HI. Let's start by analyzing the given spectroscopic data.

First, looking at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which might indicate an -OH stretch or possibly an alkyne (but that's usually around 3300). The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl (C=O), so maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. However, the absence of a broad peak around 2500-3000 for -OH might suggest it's not a carboxylic acid. Wait, no, the first peak is a broad region, maybe an -OH or an amine? Or maybe an aromatic ring with some substituents.

Then there are peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those are typical for aromatic C=C stretches. The 1610 is probably the ring's stretching, and 1450 could be a substituted ring, maybe with electron-withdrawing groups. Hmm.

Looking at the NMR data, starting with the 10.5 ppm peak as a broad singlet, integrating for 1H. That's quite high, so it's probably an aldehyde proton (but those are usually around 9-10 ppm) or maybe an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. Wait, if it's an aldehyde, the aldehyde proton is usually a triplet or something, but here it's a broad singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH proton, but the IR might not show a broad peak there. Wait, the IR has a strong 3400–2500, which could be O-H stretching. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid? But carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches around 2500-3000 and a C=O around 1700. Alternatively, maybe an alcohol? But the IR doesn't show a strong absorption at around 1050 for ethers, which I don't think is relevant here.

Wait, the NMR shows 10.5 as a singlet, maybe a benzylic proton? Or an alpha proton next to a carbonyl. Alternatively, it's a hydroxyl proton, but it's a singlet, which doesn't fit with coupling. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol proton, but that's probably less likely.

Looking at the rest of the NMR: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. The two doublets probably indicate a substituent on the benzene ring that's para, so each H is split into a doublet. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with two sets of Hs, like in a para-substituted acetophenone or similar.

Then, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH adjacent to something, maybe a CH2 or CH that's part of a substituent. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be a CH2 group next to a carbonyl or something. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to something, maybe an oxygen or a carbon adjacent to a CH. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3, probably part of an ethyl or propyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a ketone (since we have a carbonyl in IR) and an ethyl group or something similar.

Wait, let me think about the NMR again. The 10.5 ppm peak could be an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically have sharp singlets around 9-10 ppm. But if it's a broad peak, maybe it's something else. Another possibility is an acidic proton like in a phenol. But if it's a phenol, the O-H would appear as a broad peak, but the IR would show a strong absorption around 3400, which it does. So maybe it's a phenol group.

Wait, but then where is the carbonyl? Because the IR has a peak at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl—maybe an ester or a ketone. If it's a ketone, perhaps the structure is something like a benzophenone derivative.

Alternatively, considering the substituents: the aromatic ring with a group that includes a carbonyl and an ethyl chain.

Wait, the 8.0 and 7.2 ppm are doublets, so perhaps the substituent is in the para position. So if the benzene ring has a substituent that's a carbonyl group (like an acetophenone), but then other substituents.

Wait, looking at the 1H NMR: the 8.0 and 7.2 ppm are for the aromatic protons, which are para. So the substituent is at the para position, and perhaps the substituent is a propyl group or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a ketone with a side chain. Let's think about the downfield peaks. The 10.5 ppm is a singlet, which could be the aldehyde proton. If that's the case, perhaps it's an aldehyde group attached to the benzene ring. But then, the IR at 1720 would fit with an aldehyde (since aldehydes have C=O around 1720). But wait, aldehydes are usually 1710–1740, but 1720 is right in that range. However, the 10.5 ppm is a bit high for an aldehyde, but sometimes they can be higher.

If it's an aldehyde, then the benzene ring would have an aldehyde group. But then, the IR also shows peaks at 1610 and 1450, which are aromatic. So the structure would be something like p-ethyphenal (but I'm not sure if that's a real term).

But looking at the NMR, there's also a 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which could be a CH next to a carbonyl. For example, if the substituent is a propyl group attached to the ring, perhaps via a ketone. So maybe it's something like benzene with a (CH2)COCH2CH2CH3 group? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is a terminal methyl group, so probably an ethyl group. So maybe there's a CH2CH3 group somewhere. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl attached to something, perhaps a CH group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to the CH.

Putting that together, maybe we have a structure with a benzene ring, a substituent that's a carbonyl group (like ketone), and an isopropyl group. Or perhaps a secondary alcohol or something else.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) being a methyl group adjacent to a CH. Maybe it's a CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the ring, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, the IR has peaks at 3400–2500, which is a broad range. This could suggest an -OH group, but if the compound has an -OH, the NMR should show a broad peak. The NMR does have a 10.5 ppm peak, which is a singlet. If that's an -OH, maybe it's an acidic proton, like in a carboxylic acid.

Wait, if the compound is a benzoic acid derivative, the IR would have the C=O around 1700, which matches the 1720 cm-1 peak. The O-H stretch would be strong and broad around 2500-3000, which matches the 3400–2500 region. So maybe the structure is a benzoic acid with substituents.

In the NMR, the 10.5 ppm would be the -COOH proton, which is typically a broad peak. But wait, in the case of benzoic acid, the OH is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm, but sometimes it's a singlet if it's exchange broadened. So that fits.

So, assuming it's a benzoic acid, the substituent on the benzene ring would be a carboxylic acid group. But where are the other substituents? The aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, which are doublets, so they're in a para arrangement. So, the ring has another substituent in the para position relative to the COOH group.

Wait, but the other substituent in the para position would have its own protons. Hmm, perhaps it's a substituent that's an ethyl group or something else. Let me think about the other NMR signals.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the CH2 group adjacent to the COOH group. Wait, but that's getting a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of an isopropyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet integrating for 2H. That might be a CH2 next to a CH group. The 1.4 ppm is a d (doublet) for 3H, which is a CH3 attached to a CH. The 0.9 ppm is a triplet for 3H, which is a CH2CH3 group.

Putting that all together, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the ring. So, the structure would be something like 4-(propyl)benzoic acid. But wait, the NMR shows 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t,3H). So that's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group? Or perhaps a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group?

Wait, considering the 1.4 ppm as a d (doublet) for 3H, that's a methyl group attached to a CH. The 0.9 triplet is a CH2CH3, so perhaps it's a propyl group where the middle CH has a methyl and a propyl chain.

Wait, maybe it's an isobutyl group. Let me think: isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. Or maybe a sec-butyl group, which is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-? Wait, no. Let me think again.

The substituent on the benzene ring is a group that has a chain ending with a CH2CH3. Let's consider the structure:

Suppose the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the ring. But I'm not getting the exact structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isopropyl group. Let's see: isopropyl is CH(CH3)2. But then the NMR would have a CH(CH3)2 group, which would have a triplet for the CH3 groups, but in the data, we have 1.4 ppm as a d (3H), which is a single methyl group attached to a CH. So perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, that would be a longer chain. Alternatively, the substituent could be a pentyl group, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, think about the integration. The 10.5 is 1H, the aromatic signals total to 4H (2H each), and the rest are 1H, 2H, 3H, 3H. So 1+4+1+2+3+3 = 14 H? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the integration is 1H for 10.5, 2H for 8.0, 2H for 7.2. Then 1H for 2.9, 2H for 1.7, 3H for 1.4, 3H for 0.9. Total is 1+2+2+1+2+3+3 = 14 H? That seems high. But perhaps the structure has a benzene ring (5 H?), but that doesn't add up. Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, benzene has 6 H, but in the NMR, the aromatic region has 4 H (two doublets, each 2H), so perhaps the substituent is in the para position, making two sets of 2 H each.

So, the substituent is in the para position. What's the substituent? Let's think about the other groups.

The 10.5 ppm is the COOH proton. The substituent is a COOH group in the para position. Then, the other substituent would be on the same ring.

Wait, but then the other peaks don't make sense. Because the other substituent would have protons that are part of a chain. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

An example structure could be 4-(2-propyl)benzoic acid. But the NMR doesn't have enough protons for that. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached to the ring, with a branching, perhaps a sec-butyl group.

Wait, another approach: the reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI typically perform a substitution reaction, such as a dehydrohalogenation or a substitution. Wait, no, more accurately, red phosphorus is used in the presence of HI to convert alcohols to alkenes via the HWE (Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons) reaction? Or is it used for elimination reactions? Alternatively, when alcohols are treated with HI and red phosphorus, it's a common method to convert alcohols to alkyl halides. Wait, yes, red phosphorus reacts with HI to produce H3P=I, which is a good reagent for converting alcohols to alkyl iodides via substitution.

Wait, but in this case, what is the starting material? So, if I can figure out what Compound X is, perhaps I can predict the product.

So if Compound X has a benzoic acid group (from IR and NMR), and a substituent that is an alcohol, then treating it with HI and red phosphorus would convert the alcohol to a better leaving group, perhaps turning it into an iodide.

Wait, for example, if the structure is 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, but then upon reaction with HI and P, the -OH is replaced by -I, giving 4-iodobenzoic acid. But looking at the options, I don't see such a compound.

Wait, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me think again about the structure of Compound X.

If the IR indicates a carbonyl, and the NMR includes a singlet at 10.5, maybe it's a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester or another carbonyl-containing group.

Wait, another thought: the IR shows 3400–2500 cm^-1, which could be an O-H stretch. But if the compound is an ester, the O-H would be absent. Alternatively, if it's an acid chloride, but the IR would show a different carbonyl. The presence of a broad peak in IR around 2500–3000 suggests either O-H (like alcohol or carboxylic acid) or maybe an amine. But the 1720 is more likely a carbonyl, so O-H is more probable.

If it's a carboxylic acid, then the 10.5 ppm is the -OH. But then, in the NMR, the 8.0 and 7.2 are the aromatic protons. So the structure would be a substituted benzoic acid.

The substituent would have a chain that includes a CH, CH2, and a terminal CH3. Let me think about the substituent. Let's say the substituent is a propyl group attached to the ring, but with some branching. For example, a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, but that may not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a butyl group. The 0.9 ppm is a triplet, which is a CH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, triplet would come from a CH2 adjacent to a CH2. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, but I'm not sure. Let me approach this differently.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm: 1H, broad singlet → likely -COOH.
- 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H): para-substituted benzene.
- 2.9 (m, 1H): probably a CH adjacent to something.
- 1.7 (m, 2H): likely a CH2 adjacent to a CH or another group.
- 1.4 (d, 3H): a methyl attached to a CH.
- 0.9 (t, 3H): a terminal methyl, part of an ethyl group.

So, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene ring. But wait, 1.4 ppm for a methyl attached to a CH, and 1.7 for a CH2 adjacent to the CH. And 0.9 for a terminal CH2CH3. So that would make a group like -CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- attached to the ring?

Wait, maybe it's a 3-pentyl group. Let's see: the structure would be benzene ring with a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached. But I'm not quite getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached to the ring. Then, the CH3 would be at 1.4 ppm as a doublet, the CH2 would be at 1.7 (multiplet), and the terminal CH2CH3 would be at 0.9 (triplet). That seems to fit.

So, the substituent would be a propyl group with a branch. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, the substituent is an isopropyl group. But isopropyl would have a CH(CH3)2. Then the NMR would have a singlet for the CH3 groups. But in this case, the 1.4 is a doublet for 3H, which would be a single CH3 attached to a CH.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So, the structure would be benzene ring with a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) substituent, and a COOH group in the para position. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group. Then, the CH2CH(CH2CH3) would have the 2.9 (CH), 1.7 (CH2), 1.4 (CH3), and 0.9 (CH2CH3). Hmm, that could fit.

So, the substituent would be a propyl group attached via a CH. Let me try to write this out.

The structure would be benzene ring with COOH in the para position and a substituent that's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Wait, but that would make the substituent a 3-methylbutyl group or something else?

Wait, perhaps it's a 4-pentyl group. Let me think about the chain. The substituent is attached to the ring, then there's a CH, then a CH2, then a CH2CH3. So, substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Then, the CH2 would be at 1.7, the CH would be at 2.9, the CH2CH3 would be at 0.9, and the CH3 attached to the CH would be at 1.4. That fits. So, the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, but that would be a 3-pentyl group? Or maybe a butyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Then, the substituent is a secondary carbon attached to the ring, with a CH2CH2CH3 group.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a -CH(CH2CH2CH3), which would have a CH2CH2CH3 chain. So the structure would be:

Benzene ring with a COOH group in the para position and a substituent of -CH(CH2CH2CH3) in another position. But wait, the aromatic H NMR shows only four H, implying that the substituent is in the para position, but that would only leave four aromatic H. Hmm, perhaps the substituent is in the para position, making the structure 4-(something)benzoic acid.

Wait, but the substituent is in the para position relative to the COOH group, so the substituent is at position 4.

So, the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group? Or perhaps a longer chain. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH2CH3 (a butyl group), but that wouldn't explain the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) which is a methyl attached to a CH.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)2 group, but that would have two CH2CH3 groups attached to a CH.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So, the structure is 4-(1-propyl-1-methyl)benzoic acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. Isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. But that would have two CH3 groups attached to the CH.

Wait, the NMR shows a 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which is a CH3 attached to a CH. That would fit an isobutyl group. So the substituent is an isobutyl group attached to the ring. Let me see.

So, 4-isobutylbenzoic acid. Let me check the NMR.

In this structure, the aromatic ring would have a COOH group at position 1 and an isobutyl group at position 4. The isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, but I'm not sure about the NMR signals.

Wait, the isobutyl group would have a CH2 connected to the ring, then a CH connected to two CH3 groups. So the H on the CH would be split into a triplet, and the CH3 groups would be singlets. But in our NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H), which could be the CH group. The 1.4 ppm is a d (3H), which would be a CH3 attached to the CH. The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) could be the terminal CH2CH3 group.

Wait, but isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. The CH2 is connected to the ring, then the CH is connected to two CH3 groups. So that would give the CH (at 2.9 ppm, m) and the two CH3 groups as singlets. But our NMR doesn't show a triplet for the CH2. Hmm, maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3). Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, that's not correct. Let me think about the correct structure.

Butyl groups can be primary, secondary, or tertiary. The substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. No, that's not correct. Wait, the correct structure for sec-butyl is -CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group. But I'm not making progress here.

Wait, maybe it's better to look at the options given. The options are A, B, C, D. Let's read them again.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So that would be a phenyl group with an ethyl substituent in the para position, attached to a propanoic acid. So the structure would be CH2CH2-COOH attached to a benzene ring? Not sure.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with an isobutyl group and a methyl group. But the IR of Compound X has a carbonyl, which this product doesn't have, so perhaps this is not the case.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Again, no carbonyl, so probably not.

So, looking at the options, the product after reaction with red phosphorus and HI is likely an alkyl iodide, but let's see.

Wait, the reaction is between Compound X and red phosphorus and HI. So, if X has an alcohol group, the reaction would replace the -OH with -I.

Wait, but let me think again. If X is a benzoic acid with a substituent that is an alcohol, then reacting with HI and red phosphorus would convert the alcohol to an iodide.

But looking at the options, the products don't show any iodide. So perhaps X is an alcohol, and upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus, it becomes an alkyl iodide.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester or another carbonyl compound.

Wait, perhaps X is an aryl ether, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, X could be a benzyl alcohol derivative.

Wait, maybe I should reevaluate the initial assumption. Let me think about the IR and NMR again.

The IR has a 1720 cm-1 peak, which is a strong carbonyl. So, it's a carbonyl-containing compound. The 3400–2500 suggests O-H, which could be an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

In the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a singlet, which could be a carbonyl group adjacent to a CH. For example, an aldehyde. But the 1720 is more typical of a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, another thought: maybe the compound is a benzophenone derivative. For example, benzophenone has a ketone group. The substituents would be on the benzene rings. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a methyl benzoate, but then the IR would show ester carbonyl around 1740, which matches, but the NMR would have an ester group.

Wait, but the NMR has a 10.5 ppm, which would be a carbonyl adjacent proton, like an aldehyde. Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cinnamic acid derivative, but that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps it's a phenyl acetate. But again, not matching the NMR.

Alternatively, the compound could be a benzaldehyde derivative with a substituent. The IR would have the aldehyde C=O around 1720, and the aldehyde proton around 9-10 ppm.

In the NMR, 10.5 ppm as a singlet would fit an aldehyde proton. Then, the substituent would have a chain producing the other signals.

So, if the structure is benzaldehyde with a substituent that's a propyl group, for example.

But then, looking at the substituent's NMR: 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 (m,2H), 1.4 (d,3H), 0.9 (t,3H). This suggests a chain like -CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, that would be a substituent like -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. But then the aldehyde is at another position. Alternatively, the substituent is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. Hmm.

Alternatively, the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3) group. Then, the NMR would show the CH at 2.9 (m), the CH2CH3 at 0.9 (t), and the CH3 attached to the CH at 1.4 (d). That fits.

So, the structure would be benzaldehyde with a substituent of -CH(CH2CH3) in the para position. That would make the structure 4-(1-ethylpropyl)benzaldehyde? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's 4-(1-methylethyl) benzaldehyde. That would be 4-isopropylbenzaldehyde. But then, the NMR would have a singlet for the isopropyl protons, but in this case, the 1.4 is a d, which is a single CH3 attached to a CH.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So, the substituent is a 3-pentyl group. Then, the CH would be at 2.9, the CH2 would be at 1.7, the CH3 at 1.4, and the CH2CH3 at 0.9.

Putting it all together, the structure would be 4-(3-pentyl)benzaldehyde. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different substituent.

But then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI. If the substituent is an alcohol, then it would become an iodide. But I'm not seeing the alcohol in the structure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction. Red phosphorus and HI is used to convert alcohols to alkyl halides. So if the starting compound has an -OH group, the reaction would replace it with -I.

Looking at the options, the products are various substituted benzenes. For example, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group. But that doesn't have any carbonyl, so perhaps X is a benzyl alcohol derivative.

Wait, but X's IR has a carbonyl, so X must have a carbonyl group.

Hmm. Another possibility: X is a benzaldehyde with an alcohol substituent. So, the structure would be something like 4-(hydroxyethyl)benzaldehyde. But then, reacting with HI and red phosphorus would convert the -OH to -I, giving 4-(iodoethyl)benzaldehyde.

But looking at the options, I don't see such a compound. The options are either benzoic acids or substituted benzenes without carbonyls. So maybe I'm on the wrong path.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a phenol derivative. Let me see: if X is a phenol with a carbonyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the reaction of X with red phosphorus and HI produces an alkyl iodide. So, the product would have an -I group. Looking at the options, none of them have iodine, so perhaps the reaction is elimination or substitution without iodide.

Alternatively, maybe X is an alcohol that, upon reaction, forms an alkene via dehydrohalogenation, but that's more of an E2 mechanism. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -OH is replaced by -I, making an aryl iodide. But aryl iodides are possible, but the options don't show that.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction again. Red phosphorus and HI are often used to make the Hunsdiecker reaction, or for converting alcohols to iodides. So, if X has an alcohol group, the product would be the corresponding iodide.

Looking back, if X is a benzoic acid with an alcohol substituent, then after reaction, it becomes a benzoic acid with iodide substituent. But the options don't have such a compound.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzyl alcohol derivative, such as benzyl alcohol with a substituent. But then, the reaction would produce benzyl iodide, but that's not among the options.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the NMR again, perhaps the structure is a ketone.

The 10.5 ppm peak is a singlet, but for a ketone, the alpha protons (if any) would be around 2-3 ppm. So I don't think 10.5 is an alpha proton.

Wait, another possibility: the 10.5 ppm peak is a conjugated enol proton. But that would require a conjugated system, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. But then, the IR would show a C=O around 1720, which fits.

So, perhaps the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. For example, something like 4-(propenyl)benzaldehyde. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cinnamic acid derivative. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzophenone with a substituent that includes an ethyl group.

Wait, another angle: the NMR shows 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 (m,2H), 1.4 (d,3H), and 0.9 (t,3H). That looks like a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So, the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the ring.

So, putting it all together, the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group. So, the structure would be a benzene ring with a substituent of -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- in the para position, and another group that explains the 10.5 ppm peak.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group (but that doesn't fit the NMR) or a -CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a CH, which is attached to the ring. So, the substituent is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. Then, the NMR would have the CH at 2.9, the CH2 at 1.7, and the CH2CH3 at 0.9. The CH3 attached to the CH would be at 1.4 (d).

So, the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. Therefore, the structure would be benzene with a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group in the para position and a carbonyl group (like COOH or CO) at another position.

But in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a singlet, which could be a carbonyl group. So, perhaps the structure is 4-(propyl)benzoic acid. But the propyl group would be attached to the ring, and the benzoic acid would be at another position. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group attached to the ring, and the ring also has a -COOH group in the para position. So, the structure would be 4-(propyl)benzoic acid.

But wait, benzoic acid would have a carbonyl, and the substituent would be a propyl group. Let me see:

The NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm: COOH proton.
- 8.0 and 7.2: aromatic H in para positions.
- 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, 0.9: substituent chain.

So, the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group attached to the ring in the para position relative to the COOH group.

But how would that look? The substituent is a CH with a CH2CH2CH3 group attached. So, the structure would be 4-(1-methylethyl)benzoic acid? No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)- group. Then, the CH would be at 2.9, the CH2CH3 at 0.9, and the CH3 attached to the CH at 1.4. That fits.

So, the structure is 4-(1-methylethyl)benzoic acid. But 1-methylethyl is isopropyl. So, 4-isopropylbenzoic acid.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That's different.

Wait, but in this scenario, the substituent is an isopropyl group, making the structure 4-isopropylbenzoic acid. But that's not one of the options. The options have sec-butyl.

So, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let's think about that.

A sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, that's the isobutyl group. Wait, the correct structure for sec-butyl is -CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. No, I think I'm getting the substituents mixed up.

Wait, the substituent's NMR suggests a chain of -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. That would make the substituent a 3-pentyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)- group, which is a 2-methylpropyl group. But I'm not sure.

At this point, perhaps it's better to match the options with the possible structures.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. The structure would be benzene ring with a COOH group in position 4 and a sec-butyl group in another position.

What's a sec-butyl group? It's a four-carbon chain where the substituent is attached to the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring.

Wait, that would make the substituent a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group. So, the CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm, the CH would be at 2.9, the CH2CH3 would be at 0.9, and the CH3 attached to the CH would be at 1.4.

So, this fits the NMR data. Therefore, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the ring, and the compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Then, when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, which are typically used to convert alcohols to alkyl halides, but in this case, X is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group. Wait, but benzoic acid doesn't have an -OH group except for the COOH. Unless the substituent itself has an -OH, which I don't think it does.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the structure. Maybe the substituent is an alcohol group. Then, the reaction would replace the -OH with -I. Let me think again.

If X is a benzoic acid with a substituent that's a -CH2CH2OH group, then the reaction would replace the -OH with -I, making -CH2CH2I. But the NMR doesn't show a peak that would correspond to an -OH group. The 10.5 ppm is a singlet, which could be the COOH proton.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl alcohol derivative with a carbonyl group. Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Wait, going back to the reaction: if X has an -OH group, it would be replaced by -I. So, the product would have an -I substituent. But the options don't have iodine, so perhaps X is an ester or another functional group that reacts differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not substitution but elimination. Wait, red phosphorus and HI can also be used in the Wittig reaction, but that usually involves aldehydes or ketones.

Wait, perhaps X is an aldehyde with a substituent that has an -OH group. Then, the reaction would replace the -OH with -I, giving an aldehyde with an iodide substituent. But again, the options don't have iodine.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not substitution but some kind of elimination, forming an alkene. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting an ester to a carboxylic acid, but that doesn't fit.

Hmm. At this point, perhaps it's better to conclude that the structure of X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would substitute any -OH group with I. But wait, the benzoic acid has a COOH group, which is a strong acid and would dissociate, making the -OH a poor leaving group. So, perhaps the reaction is converting a different -OH group.

Wait, but in 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the only -OH is the COOH proton, which is not a good leaving group. So, maybe X isn't a benzoic acid but something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the IR's 1720 cm-1 peak is an ester or a ketone. Then, the 10.5 ppm peak could be an alpha proton to the carbonyl. For example, in an ester like CH2CH2COOR, the alpha protons are around 4 ppm, so that doesn't fit. Maybe an aldehyde.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative with a substituent that includes an ethyl group and a branching.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3) group. Then, the structure would be 4-(1-methylethyl)benzaldehyde. But then, the IR would show a strong aldehyde peak, which matches 1720. The NMR would have the aldehyde proton at 10.5, the aromatic protons at 8.0 and 7.2, and the substituent's protons at 2.9 (CH), 1.4 (CH3 attached to CH), and 0.9 (CH2CH3).

But the product after reaction with HI and red phosphorus would substitute any -OH group with -I. So, if X is 4-(1-methylethyl)benzaldehyde, and it has an -OH group somewhere, perhaps on the substituent, then the product would be 4-(1-methylethyl iodide)benzaldehyde. But again, the options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a secondary alcohol. For example, if the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)OH group attached to the ring. Then, the reaction would replace the -OH with -I, making a -CH(CH2CH3)I group. But the NMR of X would have the -OH as a broad peak, which I don't see.

Wait, the NMR of X shows a 10.5 ppm peak as a singlet, which could be an aldehyde proton. So, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that's a secondary alcohol. For example, 4-(2-hydroxypropyl)benzaldehyde. Then, the reaction would replace the -OH with -I, making 4-(2-iodopropyl)benzaldehyde. But the options don't show that.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl alcohol with a carbonyl group. But I'm not seeing it.

At this point, I'm a bit stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If X is this compound, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI would do what? Since benzoic acid has a COOH group, which doesn't have a good leaving group, I don't think the reaction would proceed unless there's another -OH group.

Wait, but maybe X isn't a benzoic acid. Let me reevaluate the IR and NMR.

If the 1720 cm-1 is a ketone, then the 10.5 ppm could be an alpha proton. But alpha protons to ketones are usually around 2-3 ppm, so I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, the 1720 could be an ester. Then, the 10.5 ppm could be an alpha proton to the ester. But that's usually around 4 ppm, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the 1720 could be an acid chloride, but that's less likely.

Wait, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde proton. So, X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that includes a sec-butyl group. Then, the substituent's NMR would fit. So, X would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde.

But then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would substitute any -OH group. But the substituent in 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde is an alkyl group, not an alcohol. So, I don't see any -OH in X.

So, perhaps I'm back to square one. Given the options, I think the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Because the NMR and IR data fit a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl substituent. Then, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would substitute any -OH group, but in this case, the only -OH is in the COOH group, which is not reactive under these conditions. So, perhaps the reaction doesn't occur, but that can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not substitution but something else. Red phosphorus and HI can also perform elimination to form alkenes if there's an adjacent leaving group. But I'm not seeing a leaving group in X.

Wait, perhaps X has an alcohol group as part of the substituent. For example, the substituent is a -CH(CH2OH) group. Then, the reaction would replace the -OH with -I, making -CH(CH2I)-. But the NMR of X doesn't show a broad peak around 1-5 ppm that would correspond to an -OH, so I'm not sure.

Hmm. I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on the NMR and IR data, the structure seems to be a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl substituent in the para position (option C). Therefore, the product after reaction would depend on what functional groups are present. However, since the options don't include the iodide product, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the substituent but converts another part.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is not substituting an alcohol but an ester. Wait, if X is a methyl benzoate, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus might not do anything. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, but that typically uses water and acid, not HI and red phosphorus.

At this point, I think the best option is to select option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid as the product, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct product is option A or D.

Wait, looking back, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus reacts with HI to form H3P=I, which is a good reagent for substitution. So, if X has an alcohol group, it would be converted to the corresponding iodide.

Looking at the options, none have iodide. So, perhaps the reaction is a different type, like elimination.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzyl alcohol derivative with a substituent. For example, X could be benzyl alcohol with a substituent that's a sec-butyl group. Then, reaction with red phosphorus and HI would convert the -OH to -I, giving the iodide.

But again, the options don't include such a compound.

Given the time I've spent and the information I have, I'll conclude that the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying Compound X based on its IR and NMR data and determining the final product after reacting with red phosphorus and HI. Here's the analysis:

### IR and NMR Data Analysis:
1. **IR Data**:
   - **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid or alcohol.
   - **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid or ketone.
   - **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretches, suggesting a substituted benzene ring.

2. **NMR Data**:
   - **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, likely the -OH proton of a carboxylic acid.
   - **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted aromatic ring.
   - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: These signals suggest a chain of carbons, likely a -CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the aromatic ring.

### Structural Interpretation:
- The IR and NMR data collectively suggest that Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. The para-substituted benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a sec-butyl group (-CH2CH(CH3)) in the para position. The NMR signals match this structure:
  - The broad singlet at 10.5 ppm corresponds to the -COOH proton.
  - The aromatic protons appear as two doublets at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm.
  - The sec-butyl group accounts for the signals at 2.9 ppm (CH), 1.7 ppm (CH2), 1.4 ppm (CH3), and 0.9 ppm (CH2CH3).

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI typically convert alcohols to alkyl halides. However, Compound X does not contain an alcohol group (the broad singlet at 10.5 ppm is from the carboxylic acid). Since the reaction does not involve the carboxylic acid group, the product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Option Analysis:
- **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: Incorrect, as the structure does not match the NMR and IR data.
- **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect, as this compound lacks a carbonyl group, inconsistent with the IR data.
- **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: Correct, as it matches the NMR and IR data, and the reaction does not alter the structure.
- **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect, as this compound lacks a carbonyl group, inconsistent with the IR data.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, as it aligns with the spectroscopic data and the reaction conditions do not change the structure.

**Answer: C**
