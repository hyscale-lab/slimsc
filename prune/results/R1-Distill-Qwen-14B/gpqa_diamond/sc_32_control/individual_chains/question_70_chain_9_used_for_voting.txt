Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a series of chemical reactions and determining the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, and D) C2v. Hmm, symmetry groups... I remember that these are related to the point groups in molecular symmetry. Point groups are used to classify molecules based on their symmetry elements, like axes of rotation, planes of symmetry, etc.

Let me try to break down the reactions given:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce extremely hazardous product E.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

I need to figure out what E is, and then determine its molecular symmetry.

Let me try to deduce the possible compounds from the reactions.

First, reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. So, A is a solid reacting with gas B in a 8:1 molar ratio. I'm thinking maybe A is a metal, and B is a halogen. Wait, because 8 equivalents could imply that B is adding 8 times per A. For example, something like sodium (A) reacting with chlorine gas (B) to form NaCl? But wait, that would be a 1:1 ratio. Hmm, but the product is bright red. Hmm, another thought: maybe A is sulfur? No, reacting with gas B... Alternatively, perhaps A is an alkali metal and B is a halide, but that doesn't immediately fit.

Wait, another angle: product C reacts with water to give A, F, and G. So, C is probably a salt because when it reacts with water, it breaks down into the metal (A) and some acids. So, for example, if C is a sulfide, like FeS, when it reacts with water, it might produce Fe metal and H2S gas. But wait, in the reaction, C reacts with water to form A plus two acids F and G. So perhaps C is an oxide or a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces a metal and two acids.

Wait, let's think about possible reactions. For example, if C is a nitride. For instance, AlN. When AlN reacts with water, it produces Al(OH)3 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, but in the problem, F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide. Let's say C is FeS. Then FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 (which is not stable) or Fe(OH)3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate. Wait, but in that case, the reaction with water wouldn't just produce a metal and two acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite or sulfate? Or maybe C is a metal oxide. For example, if A is Na, B is Cl2, then C would be NaCl. But NaCl is a neutral salt. When NaCl reacts with water, it doesn't produce any acid or base. Hmm, that's not matching the third reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a more complex salt. Let's think about when you have a reaction where a salt reacts with water to produce a metal, a strong acid, and a weak acid. So, maybe C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong acid. For example, let's say C is sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3. When it reacts with water, it dissociates into Na+, HCO3^- which can hydrolyze to produce H2CO3 (a weak acid, so maybe G is that) and maybe another acid? Or perhaps C is a different kind of salt.

Wait, another approach: when C reacts with gas D, it forms product E. The reaction is C + 2 D → E. So, what could D be? Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Common solvents are water, ethanol, DMF, etc. Let's think, what gas D could react with another gas (B) in 1:1 to form a solvent.

Wait, if B is Cl2, then D could be something else. For example, if D is H2, and H is HCl, but HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is H2, then H would be H2O, which is a solvent. That's a possibility.

But going back to reaction 1: A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C. If B is O2, then 8 equivalents would be a lot. Alternatively, if B is Cl2, and A is a metal that forms a +1 or +2 ion. Wait, for example, if A is sodium (Na), and B is Cl2, then the reaction would form NaCl. But that's 1:1. So maybe A is something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A is sulfur (solid), and B is oxygen (O2). Sulfur reacting with O2 forms SO3? But sulfur is bright yellow, but the product C is bright red. Hmm, wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide. For example, if A is iron (Fe) and B is oxygen, the reaction would form FeO, Fe3O4, or Fe2O3. Iron(III) oxide is reddish, which might fit the "bright red" description. So C could be Fe2O3.

Then, when C reacts with water, it forms A (Fe metal?), but wait, Fe2O3 is not that reactive with water. Unless it's a different reaction. Wait, perhaps C is FeS? Iron(II) sulfide is black, not red. Hmm.

Wait, maybe A is copper? Copper reacts with something to form a red product. Or perhaps A is lead? No, I'm getting stuck here.

Let me think of reaction 4: D and B react in 1:1 to form H, a solvent. So if B is O2 and D is H2, they form H2O, which is a solvent. That fits.

So B is O2, D is H2. Then, in reaction 1: A + 8 O2 → C. So, what solid A reacts with O2 in a 8:1 molar ratio to form C, which is bright red?

Wait, 8 equivalents of O2 per A. That's a lot. For example, maybe a metal that forms a +1 ion would require 8 O2 per A? Wait, perhaps A is Pb (lead), but lead's oxide is usually yellow or brown. Another thought: perhaps A is vanadium. Vanadium pentoxide is bright yellow, but maybe another oxidation state is red.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but maybe another form. Alternatively, could C be FeO? No, that's black. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms an oxide with a higher oxidation state. For example, maybe A is iron, and C is FeO4^2- or something. Alternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, let me think about reaction 3: C reacts with water to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, perhaps C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, a bicarbonate. Wait, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) when exposed to water would just dissociate, but that doesn't produce a strong acid. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite. For example, sodium sulfite (Na2SO3). When it reacts with water, maybe it can hydrolyze into 2 NaOH (strong base, but in the reaction, it's A that is reformed, so maybe A is Na?), but that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. Let me take an example: Ca3N2. When it reacts with water, it produces Ca(OH)2 and NH3. So, Ca(OH)2 is a strong base, but here, the products are F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, think of something like AlN. AlN + H2O → Al(OH)3 + NH3. Al(OH)3 is amphoteric, but in this case, the products are a metal (Al), and two acids? No, Al(OH)3 isn't an acid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfate. Suppose C is Fe2(SO4)3. When it reacts with water, perhaps it doesn't break down. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide. Let's say C is FeS. FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 + H2S. Fe(OH)2 is not very stable. But then, would that produce a strong acid (H2S is a weak acid) and another product. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps C is a carbonate. Take Na2CO3. When it reacts with H2O, it doesn't really break down into Na and CO2 and H2O, but maybe under certain conditions. Alternatively, perhaps it's sodium bicarbonate: 2 NaHCO3 → Na2CO3 + H2O + CO2. But that doesn't produce two acids.

Hmm, I'm stuck on reaction 3. Let me think about reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D (which is H2) to form E, which is extremely hazardous.

Wait, if D is H2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 H2 → E. What reaction would that be? Maybe a reduction reaction. For example, if C is a metal oxide, like Fe2O3, then reacting with H2 (reducing agent) would produce Fe and water. But in that case, E would be Fe and H2O, but E is a product, not a byproduct. Hmm, but E is extremely hazardous.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a nitride, and D is H2. For example, if C is NH3 (unlikely, since C was formed from A and B). Alternatively, maybe C is something like NO2, which could react with H2. But NO2 + H2 would react under certain conditions, perhaps to form HNO3 and H2O? Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps D is not H2. Let me see. Reaction 4: D reacts with B in 1:1 to form H, a solvent. So if H is a solvent, perhaps H is H2O (the most common solvent). So, if B is O2 and D is H2, their reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So, that fits. So D is H2 and B is O2.

So, in reaction 1: A reacts with 8 O2 to form C. So, A is a solid, probably a metal, reacting with O2 to form an oxide. Let's think of metals that form oxides with high oxygen ratios.

Wait, perhaps A is vanadium. Vanadium(V) oxide is V2O5. The formula would be V2O5, which forms from vanadium metal (V) reacting with O2. Let's see the stoichiometry. Vanadium metal is V^0, O2 is O^0. V2O5 has V in +5 oxidation state. So, the reaction would be:

2 V + 5 O2 → 2 V2O5? Wait, no, wait: Each V atom in V2O5 has an oxidation state of +5. So for two V atoms, the total positive charge is 10. Each O is -2, so 5 O's contribute -10. So overall neutral. So the reaction would be 2 V + 5 O2 → 2 V2O5? Wait, that would be 5 O2 (which is 10 O atoms) for 2 V2O5 (each has 5 O, so 10 O total). So the stoichiometry is 2 V + 5 O2 → 2 V2O5. Wait, but in the question, the reaction uses 8 equivalents of B (O2) per A. So, if A is V, and per mole of V, you need 5/2 moles of O2. But that's 2.5 O2 per V. That doesn't match the 8:1 ratio.

Hmm, maybe another metal. Let's think of chromium. Chromium(VI) oxide is CrO3. The reaction would be 4 Cr + 3 O2 → 2 CrO3. So, per Cr, 3/4 O2. Not matching 8:1.

Wait, another idea: maybe A is lead. Lead dioxide is PbO2. The reaction is 2 Pb + O2 → 2 PbO2. So per Pb, 0.5 O2. Not matching 8 equivalents.

Wait, perhaps A is magnesium. Mg reacts with O2 to form MgO. The reaction is 2 Mg + O2 → 2 MgO. So, per Mg, 0.5 O2. Not 8.

Hmm, maybe A is a transition metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide with a higher ratio of O2. Alternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is not a metal but a non-metal. For example, carbon. Carbon reacts with O2 to form CO2, but that's a gas, not a solid. Alternatively, maybe A is phosphorus. White phosphorus reacts with O2 to form P4O10. The reaction would be P4 + 5 O2 → P4O10. So, per P4 (which is the solid), 5 O2. So that's 5 equivalents of O2 per 1 equivalent of P4. Not 8.

Hmm, perhaps A is sulfur. Sulfur reacts with O2 to form SO3. The reaction is S + 3 O2 → 2 SO3. So per S, 3 O2. Still not 8.

Wait, perhaps this isn't an oxide. Maybe another compound.

Wait, going back to reaction 3: C reacts with water to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, C must be a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces a metal, a strong acid, and a weak acid. So, let's think of such a salt.

Wait, if C is a nitride, like AlN: AlN + H2O → Al(OH)3 + NH3. NH3 is a weak base, but in this case, F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, if C is a sulfide: MS → M + H2S. H2S is a weak acid. But then, what's F? Maybe another acid. But where would that come from? Unless C is a mixed salt.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is a carbonate. For example, NaHCO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't really do much, just dissociates. But when heated, it decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But that's not the same as reacting with water.

Wait, another angle: the two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, perhaps F is HCl (strong) and G is H2S (weak), or H2CO3 (weak). Or maybe F is HNO3 and G is H3PO4, but that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces a strong acid and a weak acid. So, perhaps it's a salt of a polyprotic acid. For example, suppose C is NaHCO3. When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze to produce H2CO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). But that doesn't match because F is an acid, not a base.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze to form H2SO3 (a weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). Again, not matching, because F is an acid.

Hmm, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong type of salt. Maybe C is a nitrate? No, nitrates are generally stable with water.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form a metal hydroxide and release an acid. For example, if C is a peroxide, like Na2O2. Na2O2 + H2O → 2 NaOH + O2. But that produces a base (NaOH) and oxygen gas, not acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a superoxide, like KO2. KO2 + H2O → 2 KOH + O2. Again, that's a base.

Wait, maybe C is a metal carbide. For example, CaC2 reacts with water to produce Ca(OH)2 and C2H2 (which is acetylene, a weak acid? No, acetylene is a hydrocarbon, not an acid). Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide. Let's take FeS. FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 + H2S. Fe(OH)2 is not very stable and might react further. H2S is a weak acid. So, product would be Fe (if Fe(OH)2 decomposes), but that's not matching the reaction, which produces A, F, and G. Wait, in this scenario, A would be Fe. So, FeS reacting with water gives Fe, H2S (weak acid), and perhaps another acid? I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. Let's say Mg3N2. Mg3N2 + 6 H2O → 3 Mg(OH)2 + 2 NH3. NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that's not matching.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think of the reaction where a salt reacts with water to produce a metal, a strong acid, and a weak acid. The only scenario I can think of is if C is a metal bicarbonate. For example, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) reacting with water doesn't produce a strong acid. Maybe another bicarbonate. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide of a transition metal that hydrolyzes to form a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait! What about a metal carbonyl? No, that's probably not. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal azide? No, probably not.

Wait, another idea: maybe C is a peroxide, like H2O2. But H2O2 is a liquid, not a solid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe C is a complex salt. For example, something like CuSO4·5H2O. But when it reacts with water, it would just dissociate into CuSO4 and H2O. Not producing two acids.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress here. Let me try to think of the final product E. Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E. D is H2, so E is formed when C reacts with H2. E is extremely hazardous. So, what reaction between C (a salt, perhaps) and H2 forms a dangerous product?

Wait, maybe C is a nitride, and E is ammonia (NH3), but that's not extremely hazardous. Or perhaps C is a sulfide, reacting with H2 to form H2S? But H2S is a gas, and E is a product, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if C is a halogen oxide, like ClO2, and D is H2, then reaction could produce HClO2 and H2O. But I'm not sure if that's extremely hazardous.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide that, when reacted with H2, produces a metal and water. For example, CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O. But that's a typical reduction reaction. So, E would be Cu (a metal) and H2O. But E is a product, so perhaps it's a mixture? Not sure.

Wait, but if E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a highly toxic gas. What about phosgene (COCl2)? No, that's produced from other reactions. Or perhaps E is something like HCN, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps E is hydrogen fluoride (HF), which is a dangerous acid. But how would C and H2 form HF?

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. Let me try to think of product E's molecular symmetry. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Which of these are common for certain molecules.

D4h is the symmetry group of molecules like methane (but that's Td), or perhaps something with a four-fold axis and planes. D∞h symmetry is common for linear molecules like CO2, H2O (though H2O has D2h), O3, etc. C2 is a two-fold rotation axis. C2v has a two-fold rotation and a vertical mirror plane.

Wait, what's the point group of H2O? It's D2h. So that's not among the options. CO2 is D∞h. SO2 is D2h. ClF3 has C3v. CH3Cl has C2v. NH3 is Td.

Wait, if E is a linear molecule, like CO2, its point group would be D∞h. So option C is D∞h.

But what if E is something else? Let's say E is Cl2O7 (dichlorodioxygen), which has a structure like O2 with Cl atoms. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, if E is a molecule with a center of inversion and a mirror plane, like H2O (but that's D2h), or something else.

Alternatively, if E is O3 (ozone), which has a point group D3h, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, another angle: the extremely hazardous product E. What are some extremely hazardous chemicals? Cyanide (like CN- is toxic, but as a molecule, perhaps HCN is very toxic). HCN is a linear molecule, so its point group would be D∞h. So option C is D∞h.

Another possibility is phosgene (COCl2), which is a toxic gas. Phosgene has a structure where it's a bent molecule, trigonal planar maybe. Its point group is D3h, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, another extremely hazardous chemical is sarin gas, which is a nerve agent. Sarin has a structure with a central phosphorus atom and various substituents. Its symmetry group is probably C2v. Because if it's a chiral molecule with a certain plane, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but let's think about the reactions again. If in reaction 2, C reacts with 2 H2 to form E, which is highly dangerous. If C is a nitride, say, and D is H2, then E could be NH3, but that's not extremely hazardous unless in high concentrations. Alternatively, if C is a cyanide, but then reaction 1 would have to form cyanide.

Wait, let me think. Reaction 3: C reacts with water to give A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, perhaps C is a cyanide salt. For example, KCN. KCN reacts with water to produce KOH (strong base), which is F? But F is supposed to be a strong acid, not a base. Hmm, no. Alternatively, if C is NaCN, then NaCN + H2O → NaOH + HCN. HCN is a weak acid. But then F is NaOH (strong base) and G is HCN (weak acid). But in the problem, F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is something else, like a sulfite. Say, Na2SO3. Na2SO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + H2SO3. H2SO3 is a weak acid, but NaOH is a strong base. But again, F is supposed to be a strong acid.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think about E again. If E's molecular symmetry is D∞h, that would suggest it's a linear molecule. So perhaps E is a molecule like O2, but O2 is diatomic, which has D∞h symmetry. But O2 is not extremely hazardous. Alternatively, O3 is triatomic, with D3h symmetry, which isn't an option.

Wait, another linear molecule: HCN. HCN is linear, so D∞h symmetry. HCN is a highly toxic gas. So if E is HCN, that fits the description. Then, how would C and H2 form HCN?

Wait, let's reconstruct. C is a product of A and B (O2), which is a solid. Then, C reacts with H2 (D) to form HCN (E). So, C + 2 H2 → HCN + something else?

Wait, that would imply that C is a compound that, when reduced with H2, produces HCN. Maybe C is CN−O− something. Alternatively, perhaps C is a cyanate, like O=C=N−.

Wait, let me think. If C is sodium cyanate (NaOCN), then reacting with H2 might produce HCN. But the reaction would be NaOCN + H2 → NaOH + HCN. But that's in the presence of water, which is the third reaction.

Wait, but in reaction 2, C reacts with D (H2) to form E. So, perhaps C is something like OCN−, and with H2, it forms HCN and water.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrile. Nitriles (like CH3CN) can react with H2 in the presence of a catalyst to form alkanes (like CH3CH3), but that produces a non-toxic product.

Hmm, this is getting too speculative. Let me try to think differently.

If E has D∞h symmetry, which is option C, then perhaps E is a linear molecule. Let's think of E as CO (carbon monoxide), which is linear and has D∞h symmetry. But is CO extremely hazardous? Yes, it's a toxic gas. So if E is CO, then how is it formed?

Reaction 2: C + 2 H2 → CO + something. Let's see, stoichiometry would be C + 2 H2 → CO + H2O? Or maybe another product.

Wait, if C is a metal oxide, like FeO. FeO + H2 → Fe + H2O. E would be H2O, which isn't dangerous in this context. Or perhaps C is a different oxide.

Alternatively, if C is a carbonate, like CaCO3. CaCO3 + H2 → CaO + CO2 + H2O. CO2 is a gas, but not extremely hazardous unless in high concentrations.

Alternatively, perhaps E is HCN as I thought earlier. So, C is a cyanide salt. But earlier, that didn't fit with reaction 3.

Wait, let's make an assumption: let's say that E is CO, which is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. So the answer would be option C) D∞h.

But let's see if that fits the rest of the reactions. Reaction 2: C + 2 H2 → CO + H2O. So, what would C be in this case? Maybe C is a metal carbonyl. For example, Fe(CO)5. But that's a liquid or solid, not sure. Alternatively, if C is a carbonate, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a formate salt. For example, HCOONa. When it reacts with H2, perhaps it forms H2O and CO.

But I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, perhaps E is ClF3, which is a highly toxic gas. ClF3 has a trigonal pyramidal structure, so its point group is C3v, which isn't one of the options.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to summarize what I know:

- A is a solid, reacts with 8 equivalents of B (probably O2) to form C (bright red solid).

- C reacts with H2 (D) in 2 equivalents to form E, a dangerous product.

- C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

- D (H2) and B (O2) react to form H2O, which is a solvent.

So, perhaps A is lead (Pb). Pb reacts with O2 to form PbO2 (lead dioxide), which is bright yellow, not red. So that doesn't fit.

Another thought: perhaps A is Fe, and B is O2. Fe reacts with O2 to form Fe3O4 (magnetite), which is black, not red. Alternatively, FeO is black, Fe2O3 is reddish. Oh, Fe2O3 is reddish, maybe "bright red" is a way to describe it. So, C could be Fe2O3.

So, reaction 1: Fe + O2 → Fe2O3. The stoichiometry is 4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3. So per Fe, 3/4 O2. That's not 8 equivalents. So that doesn't fit the 8:1 ratio.

Hmm. Maybe A is a different metal. Wait, what about vanadium? Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is bright yellow, but perhaps another oxide is red. Alternatively, MnO2 is dark brown.

Wait, maybe A is chromium. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but perhaps another form is red.

Alternatively, perhaps A is cobalt. Cobalt(III) oxide is black, but perhaps another compound is red.

I'm stuck again. Let me think about E again. If E is a linear molecule, D∞h symmetry makes sense. So perhaps E is CO, which is a toxic gas, and thus extremely hazardous.

So, the molecular symmetry group of E would be D∞h, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of chemical reactions, and the goal is to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.  
   - B is likely oxygen gas (O₂) based on its role in forming oxides.  
   - A is likely a metal that reacts with O₂ to form a red oxide.  
   - A possible candidate for C is Fe₂O₃ (iron(III) oxide), which is reddish in color.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce extremely hazardous product E.  
   - D is identified as hydrogen gas (H₂) based on its role in forming H₂O (a solvent in reaction 4).  
   - The reaction C + 2 H₂ → E suggests a reduction process.  
   - E is described as extremely hazardous, leading to the consideration of highly toxic gases like HCN (hydrogen cyanide) or CO (carbon monoxide).  
   - CO is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, making it a plausible candidate for E.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A, F (a strong acid), and G (a weak acid).  
   - This suggests that C is a salt that hydrolyzes to produce a metal (A), a strong acid, and a weak acid.  
   - For example, if C is Fe₂O₃, it could hydrolyze to form Fe (A), H₂SO₄ (strong acid), and H₂O (weak acid).  
   - However, the exact identity of C is not definitively determined in the analysis.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.  
   - D is H₂, and B is O₂, so H is likely H₂O, a common solvent.

5. **Molecular Symmetry of E**:  
   - If E is CO (carbon monoxide), it is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry.  
   - CO is a highly toxic gas, fitting the description of being extremely hazardous.  
   - Other candidates like HCN or phosgene were considered but did not align as well with the reaction conditions or symmetry options provided.

Based on the analysis, the molecular symmetry group of E is most consistent with D∞h, corresponding to a linear molecule like CO. 

Answer: C
