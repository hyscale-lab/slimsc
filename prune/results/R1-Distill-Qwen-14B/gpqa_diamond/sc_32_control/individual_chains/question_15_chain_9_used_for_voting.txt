Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that transit probability depends on the orbital distance and the sizes of the star and planet. But wait, the question gives me some specific details. Let me think through this step by step.

So, the scenario is that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. The researchers want to observe which one has a higher chance of transiting because they have limited time. 

The question states that both have the same minimum mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star since a shorter period means it's orbiting more quickly. 

Their host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Oh, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, so maybe it's a subgiant or something, but same radius. 

I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The transit probability formula, as I recall, is P = (R_planet / R_star) * (1 / a), or wait, no, maybe it's (R_planet / R_star) divided by something else. Wait, I think the formula is P = (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (a_p / R_s)), but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (a_p / R_s)^{-3/2} or something? Wait, no, that's probably not right.

Wait, correct me. The transit probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Because for a transit to happen, the planet's orbit must be aligned edge-on, and the probability increases with a smaller orbital distance relative to the star's size. 

Wait, more accurately, the probability of a transit is given by (R_p / R_s) * [ (R_p + R_s) / a_p ) ]^-1, but I'm not too confident. Alternatively, I think the geometric probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1/a_p) or something like that. Or wait, another approach: the probability is (R_p / R_s) multiplied by (1 / sqrt(a_p^2 - R_s^2)), but I'm getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should think about the actual formula.

Wait, I found this in my notes: The transit probability (P) is given by:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)² / (a_p / R_s) * (1 / (a_p / R_s))^0.5 )

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star (from the planet's perspective) that would cause a transit. It's approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a_p). Because the chance depends on how likely the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / a_p), but maybe there's a square root or something. Oh wait, the actual formula for the geometric probability is:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p / R_s) ) ) 

Wait, no, perhaps it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. So P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a_p). Because a_p is the semi-major axis, which is the distance from the star. 

Let me make sure. The probability is the ratio of the star's area that the planet can cover, considering the planet's orbital distance. So the formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s) / a_p ) * (something else?) Hmm, I'm a bit shaky on this. Alternatively, another source says that the probability is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p / R_s)) ) ?

Wait, I think the correct formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s) / a_p ) ) / something? Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should think of it as the ratio of the planet's cross-sectional area to the star's area, multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it crosses the star's disk. 

Wait, the geometric probability is the ratio of the areas of the star's disk that the planet can cover, but only if the orbital distance is such that the planet's path can intersect the star. So the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a_p), but wait, that doesn't seem dimensionally correct. Maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a_p / R_s)), which would make the units correct. Because R_s is in meters, a_p is in meters, so a_p / R_s is dimensionless, so 1/(a_p/R_s) is dimensionless.

Wait, let me think in terms of the formula. The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star that the planet can cover when its orbital plane is edge-on, which is (R_p / R_s)^2, multiplied by the fraction of the orbit where this can happen, which depends on the orbital distance a_p. Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, the probability is a function of the orbital distance and the star's size. So the formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a_p) ), because the planet's orbital distance a_p is much larger than the star's radius R_s, so the probability is proportional to (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (R_s / a_p) ) = (R_p^2 * R_s) / (a_p R_s^2) ) = (R_p^2) / (a_p R_s). 

Wait, that seems plausible. So P = (R_p^2) / (a_p R_s) )

But wait, in that case, since both planets have the same mass, but I don't think the planet's mass directly affects the transit probability, because the formula only depends on R_p (the planet's radius), R_s (star's radius), and a_p (semi-major axis of the planet's orbit).

Wait, but the question says the planets are Earth-like. So their radii are roughly the same as Earth's. So R_p1 ≈ R_p2.

But wait, the question doesn't specify that the planets have the same radius. Oh, but wait, it says "Earth-like planets"—so perhaps they have similar radii, but maybe they're different. The question states that both have the same masses, but that's not necessarily the same as radius. But since they're Earth-like, perhaps we can assume their radii are similar to Earth's. So, R_p1 ≈ R_p2. So R_p1 = R_p2.

So, the transit probability for each planet would be proportional to ( (R_p^2) ) / (a_p * R_s )

Because for each planet, P = (R_p^2) / (a_p R_s )

So let me compute the probabilities for each planet.

First, let's note the given data:

- Planet_1's orbital period P1 is three times shorter than P2's. So P1 = P2 / 3.

But Kepler's third law: (P^2) = (4π²/G(M+m)) a^3. Since M is the star's mass and m is the planet's mass. But since m is much smaller than M, we can approximate P^2 ≈ (4π²/(G M)) a^3.

So a^3 = (G M P^2 )/(4π² ). So a is proportional to (M P^2 )^(1/3)

So for each planet, a_p is proportional to (M * P^2 )^(1/3 )

Let me compute a_p for each planet.

Planet_1's star mass M1 = 2 M2 (since M1 is twice M2). 

P1 = (1/3) P2.

So a1 ∝ (M1 * P1²)^(1/3 )

M1 = 2 M2, P1 = P2 /3.

So a1 ∝ (2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 )^(1/3 )

= (2 M2 * P2² / 9 )^(1/3 )

= ( (2/9) M2 P2² )^(1/3 )

Similarly, a2 ∝ (M2 * P2² )^(1/3 )

So the ratio a1 / a2 is [ (2/9 M2 P2² ) / ( M2 P2² ) ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ (2/9) / 1 ]^(1/3 ) = (2/9)^(1/3 )

Which is the same as (2)^(1/3) / (9)^(1/3) ) 

But 9 is 3^2, so 9^(1/3) = 3^(2/3) = approx 2.08, but let me compute it numerically.

Wait, (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.2222)^(0.3333) ≈ around 0.606.

Wait, but I can leave it as (2/9)^(1/3).

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3 )

But wait, let me think again. Because a1 is proportional to (M1 * P1² )^(1/3 ), and a2 is (M2 * P2² )^(1/3 )

So a1 / a2 = [ (M1 / M2 ) * ( P1² / P2² ) ]^(1/3 )

M1 = 2 M2, P1 = P2/3.

So (M1/M2) = 2.

(P1² / P2²) = ( (P2/3)^2 ) / P2^2 ) = (1/9 )

So (2 * 1/9 ) = 2/9.

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is approximately 0.606 times a2.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact value, but I can keep it as (2/9)^(1/3) for now.

Now, back to the transit probability formula.

P1 = (R_p1^2) / (a1 R_s1 )

P2 = (R_p2^2) / (a2 R_s2 )

But wait, the question says that both host stars have the same radius. So R_s1 = R_s2 = R.

Thus, R_s1 = R_s2 = R.

Also, since the planets are Earth-like, their radii are approximately the same. So R_p1 ≈ R_p2. Let me call R_p = R_p1 = R_p2.

So, since R_p is same for both, and R_s is same, the ratio of probabilities P1/P2 is:

( (R_p1^2)/(a1 R_s ) ) / ( (R_p2^2)/(a2 R_s ) ) ) 

= ( (R_p^2 )/(a1 R ) ) / ( (R_p^2 )/(a2 R ) ) )

= (a2) / (a1 )

But from earlier, a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3 )

So a2 / a1 = 1/( (2/9)^(1/3) ) = (9/2)^(1/3 )

So P1/P2 = (a2/a1) = (9/2)^(1/3 )

Wait, (9/2) is 4.5, and the cube root of that is about 1.65. Because 1.65^3 ≈ 4.49, which is close to 4.5.

So P1 is approximately 1.65 times P2, or P1 ≈ 1.65 P2.

Wait, that can't be. Because if a1 is smaller than a2, then a2/a1 is greater than 1, so P1 would be higher than P2. Because the transit probability is inversely proportional to a_p.

Wait, that's correct. Because for the same star radius, a planet closer to the star (smaller a_p) has a higher transit probability. So if a1 < a2, P1 > P2.

So according to the calculation, P1 is about 1.65 times higher than P2. So the probability for Planet_1 is higher. So the researchers should prefer observing Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D: ~2.7 times, which is higher than our calculation.

Wait, but let me recheck the math.

We have a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3 )

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3 )

So a2 = a1 / (2/9)^(1/3 ) )

So a2/a1 = 1/(2/9)^(1/3 ) = (9/2)^(1/3 )

Which is cube root of 4.5.

Calculating cube root of 4.5.

Let me compute 1.6^3 = 4.096, 1.65^3 = (1.65)^3 = 1.65 * 1.65 = 2.7225; then *1.65 = approx 4.489. So yes, cube root of 4.5 is about 1.65.

So P1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than P2. So the probability for Planet_1 is higher, so option C is correct.

Wait, but let me recheck the formula. Did I get it right?

Wait, the transit probability formula: some sources say it's P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/a_p ) * (some function of the orbital distance relative to the star's radius). Alternatively, I've heard that the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/(sqrt(a_p^2 - R_s^2))) ), but that seems more complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a_p) ), which is the same as (R_p^2 R_s) / (R_s^2 a_p) ) = R_p^2/(R_s a_p ), which is what I used earlier. So that part is correct.

Given that, the conclusion is that P1 is about 1.65 times higher than P2. So the researchers should choose Planet_1.

Looking at the options, the correct option is C: Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_p^2}{a_p R_s}
\]

where \(R_p\) is the planet's radius, \(a_p\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and \(R_s\) is the star's radius. Since both planets are Earth-like, their radii are assumed to be approximately equal (\(R_{p1} \approx R_{p2}\)), and both host stars have the same radius (\(R_s1 = R_s2 = R_s\)).

### Step 1: Orbital Distance Ratio
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \(a_p\) is proportional to:

\[
a_p \propto (M \cdot P^2)^{1/3}
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- \(M_1 = 2M_2\), as the host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star.
- \(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\), as Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's.

Thus, the ratio of their orbital distances is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{M_1 \cdot P_1^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Numerically, \(\left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606\), so:

\[
a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2
\]

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis (\(P \propto 1/a_p\)). Therefore, the ratio of the transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}} = \left(\frac{9}{2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Numerically, \(\left(\frac{9}{2}\right)^{1/3} \approx 1.65\). Thus:

\[
P_1 \approx 1.65 \cdot P_2
\]

### Conclusion
Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

**Correct Option:**

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.
