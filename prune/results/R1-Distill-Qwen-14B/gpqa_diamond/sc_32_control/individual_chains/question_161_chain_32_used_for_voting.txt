Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about a transmission electron microscope setup. Hmm, let's read it carefully.

The question says Mike is working on a high-resolution TEM operating at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, which is less than 1e-9 Torr. The idea is to minimize gas particles because that's better for electron microscopy—fewer gas molecules mean less scattering and better image resolution, I guess.

But some gas particles are still there, as the mass spectrometer detected. Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules, which is λ1. He based this on factors like the compartment's volume, pressure, and temperature.

Now, when he starts the electron beam, he notices something about the mean free path. He finds that it's now λ2, not λ1 anymore. And the temperature didn't change. So what's going on here?

Wait, what do I remember about mean free path? The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. In a vacuum, if there are fewer gas molecules, the mean free path is longer because particles don't collide as often.

The formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the collision diameter, and P is pressure. But wait, I'm not sure if I remember that correctly. Oh right, another way to write it is λ = (1)/(√2 * n * σ²), where n is the number density and σ is the collision cross-section. Alternatively, maybe λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P) which comes from the ideal gas law, since P = nRT.

Wait, another approach: the mean free path is inversely proportional to the pressure and the square of the molecular diameter. So, lower pressure means longer mean free path. So when the pressure decreases, λ increases.

Now, in the scenario, the initial mean free path is λ1, which Mike calculated under the ultra-high vacuum conditions. But when the electron beam is turned on, something changes. The temperature is the same, so that factor doesn't change. But wait, the electron beam might affect the gas in some way.

Oh! Right, the electron beam can cause effects like heating the sample or the gas. But the question says the temperature remains the same, so maybe that's not it. Alternatively, the electron beam might cause gas molecules to ionize or dissociate, changing their properties. Or, perhaps the electron beam exerts a force on the gas molecules, causing a change in their distribution.

Wait, another possibility: when the electron beam is on, it's possible that the gas molecules are being bombarded by electrons. This could lead to the gas being excited, perhaps increasing the electron density or changing the mean free path because the electrons are now interacting with both the gas and the beam.

But in the given scenario, the temperature is constant, so that factor isn't changing. So what else affects the mean free path? Let me think.

Oh, wait, the mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the pressure. If the pressure increases, λ decreases. But the initial setup already has a very low pressure. If the electron beam somehow causes a local increase in pressure, that would make λ2 smaller than λ1. But why would the pressure change? Because maybe the electron beam heats the gas, causing it to expand and pressure to drop? Or perhaps the opposite.

Wait, no. Pressure is a function of the number of molecules and their kinetic energy. So if the electron beam adds energy to the gas molecules, that would increase their temperature, but the question states the temperature remains the same. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to become partially ionized. When gas molecules are ionized, they become charged and might interact more with the electron beam or the chamber walls. But how does ionization affect the mean free path?

If some gas molecules are ionized, the number of neutral atoms or molecules in the compartment would decrease. The mean free path is based on collisions between gas molecules, but if some are charged, perhaps they're more likely to interact with the walls or the beam, but not necessarily each other. Wait, but collisions between charged particles and neutral particles would contribute to more collisions, thus decreasing the mean free path.

So, if some gas molecules are ionized, the effective number of particles that can collide with each other (neutral-neutral) might decrease. Wait, no, because ionized particles would interact differently. Let me think again.

Wait, if a gas molecule is ionized, it's now an ion or electron. So, when the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are being ionized. The presence of ions and electrons would mean that the gas is now a plasma or partially ionized. In such a case, the mean free path could change.

But how does ionization affect the mean free path? The mean free path is about the average distance between collisions for a molecule. If the gas is more ionized, then the neutral molecules are fewer. So, the number density of neutral molecules (n) decreases because some are ionized. Since λ is proportional to 1/(n), if n decreases, λ increases. So if n decreases, λ2 would be greater than λ1.

Wait, but the initial calculation λ1 was based on the gas being in a certain pressure and temperature. But when the beam is on, perhaps the gas becomes ionized, which effectively reduces the number of neutral particles. So, for the same pressure, if the number of neutral particles decreases, their number density (n) would be lower. So, λ would be longer, so λ2 would be greater than λ1.

Wait, but in the problem statement, Mike calculated λ1 based on the vacuum state. So during his calculation, he considered the gas in the ultra-high vacuum condition. When the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas density doesn't change much (since pressure is same), but the presence of the beam changes the way particles move or interact.

Alternatively, perhaps the electrons in the beam cause the gas to be excited, leading to more collisions. Wait, but then that would lower λ, making λ2 smaller than λ1.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam's presence adds another factor. The mean free path is about collisions between gas molecules. But if the electrons in the beam are causing more frequent collisions (because the beam particles hit the gas particles), then the effective mean free path for the gas particles would be altered. Hmm, but that's a different scenario.

Wait, maybe the electron beam causes gas molecules to be more likely to scatter electrons, but that's about electron scattering, not gas molecule collisions.

Alternatively, when the electron beam is on, it could cause the gas molecules to move faster (if they gain kinetic energy). But the temperature is the same, so that can't be it.

Wait, maybe the presence of the electron beam causes a change in the effective pressure. Because the electrons are moving quickly, perhaps they contribute to the pressure in the chamber. But no, the overall pressure is still low, as measured by the mass spectrometer.

Wait, but the question says that the gas particles remained, and Mike found λ1. Then, when the beam is on, Mike observes λ2, which is different.

Hmm. Another angle: in the absence of the electron beam, the gas molecules' mean free path is λ1. When the beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are more likely to interact with the beam, causing them to have shorter paths because electrons are scattering them more. Wait, but how does that affect the mean free path of the gas molecules?

Wait, perhaps the mean free path λ is the average distance a gas molecule travels without colliding with another gas molecule. The presence of the electron beam could cause the gas molecules to be hit by electrons, but that's a different type of collision. If these collisions are frequent, they would effectively reduce the mean free path of the gas molecules, making λ2 shorter than λ1.

But wait, in the initial state (beam off), collisions are between gas molecules. When the beam is on (assuming the electrons are moving through the gas), the gas molecules can collide with the electrons as well. So the gas molecules have more possible collision partners (the electrons), leading to more frequent collisions. Therefore, the mean free path λ would be shorter. So λ2 < λ1.

Wait, but the initial mean free path λ1 was calculated without considering the electron beam. So when the beam is on, the gas molecules can collide with the electrons, which are much lighter and perhaps more frequent collisions.

Wait, but gas molecules are much heavier than electrons. The mean free path is determined by the most probable collision, which for gas molecules is with each other, unless another process is dominant.

Wait, if the electron beam has a high current, the number of electrons could be significant. So when the beam is on, the gas molecules have another source of collisions—electrons. So the effective number of collisions increases, leading to a shorter mean free path. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

So the mean free path decreases when the beam is on. That would mean λ2 < λ1, which is option C.

But wait, let me think again. Another approach: the mean free path for gas molecules depends on their own density and their cross-sectional area for collisions. The formula is λ = 1/(sqrt(2) * n * σ² ), where n is number density, σ is collision diameter.

If the presence of the electron beam causes any changes to n or σ?

But in the problem statement, the pressure is the same, and temperature is same, so n should be the same. Unless the beam causes some molecules to be ionized, which would change n for the neutral particles.

Wait, if some gas molecules are ionized (so they become charged and perhaps stick to the walls or leave the compartment), then the number density of neutral gas molecules (n) would decrease. If n decreases, λ increases. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

But would the ionization cause the pressure to change? Because if some ions are created, the number of particles in the gas phase would change.

Hmm, perhaps. But the problem says the pressure is the same. Wait, but ionization can cause a change in the number of particles. Let me think about that.

In an ideal gas, the pressure is P = nRT. If the ionization process converts some neutral particles into ions, which are charged and have effectively a different number of particles. For example, if a molecule is split into two ions, the number of particles could increase. But wait, in our case, the pressure is measured as the same, so perhaps that effect is negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps the ionizing effect doesn't change the pressure much because the number of charged particles is small. But if the ionization reduces the number of neutral particles (since some are ionized and perhaps removed from the gas phase), then n decreases, leading to λ increasing.

So if λ2 is greater than λ1, then the correct option would be A, which says λ2 >= 1.22 λ1. But wait, option A is λ2 >= 1.22 λ1. So if λ2 is larger, that's possible.

But I'm a bit confused here. Let me recap.

Without the electron beam (beam off), the mean free path is λ1. With the beam on, some change occurs. The options are whether λ2 is longer, shorter, same as λ1.

If the electron beam causes ionization of gas molecules, which reduces the number of neutral gas molecules. So n decreases. Since λ is inversely proportional to n, λ increases. So λ2 is larger than λ1.

But how much larger? The question doesn't specify the degree. The options are about whether it's greater or lesser.

So in that case, λ2 would be larger than λ1, which would correspond to option A or D.

Wait, option A says λ2 >= 1.22 λ1. So if ionization leads to a significant decrease in n, then λ2 is larger. But I'm not sure if the effect would be that big.

Alternatively, another effect: when the beam is on, the gas molecules might be heated locally, but the overall temperature remains the same. Hmm, but that shouldn't change the mean free path if pressure and temperature are the same.

Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam could cause gas molecules to have more energy, thus higher speed, which would decrease the mean free path. Wait, but if they move faster, they would collide more often, leading to a shorter mean free path. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

But how? Because if speed increases, the collision frequency increases? Let me think about the formula.

The mean free path is inversely proportional to the product of the number density and the collision cross-section. The collision cross-section depends on the relative speed of the particles. The cross-section σ is roughly proportional to the square of the relative velocity. So σ = π d², where d is the collision diameter. Wait, no, that's for a fixed relative speed. The actual cross-section depends on the relative speed because the collision duration is shorter for higher speeds.

Wait, the collision rate (Z) is given by Z = n * σ * v, where v is the relative speed. The cross-section for a collision is σ = π d². So when the speed increases, the collision rate increases, and thus the mean free path λ = 1/Z = 1/(n σ v). So λ is inversely proportional to v.

So if the gas molecules are moving faster (perhaps due to electron beam heating), λ would be smaller. Thus λ2 < λ1.

But the question states that the sample compartment temperature remains the same, so the thermal velocity shouldn't change. So if the temperature is same, the average speed v is same, so λ remains same. Hmm, but perhaps the beam causes some localized heating or changes the average speed.

Wait, but the question says the sample compartment's temperature remains the same, which implies that the thermal velocity is unchanged. So if v is the same, then the presence of the electron beam shouldn't change λ if n is same.

But wait, if the electron beam causes gas molecules to gain energy, but the overall temperature doesn't change. So perhaps the beam is causing some other effect, like ionization, which changes the number of neutral gas molecules.

So, for example, if the electron beam ionizes some gas molecules, making them charged and causing them to stick to the walls or be pumped out. Then, the number density n of neutral gas molecules would decrease, leading to a longer mean free path, so λ2 > λ1.

But if the pressure is still the same, as measured, that would imply that the total number of particles (including ions) is the same. But if ions are being created, perhaps the neutral density drops, but the ion density increases. But the mean free path is about collisions between neutral molecules. So if n decreases, λ increases.

So in that case, λ2 would be greater than λ1.

But the options don't have λ2 being greater in all cases, except for options A and D. So option A says λ2 >= 1.22 λ1, and D says λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 λ1.

Wait, but I'm not sure whether the effect would be that drastic. 1.22 times is an increase by about 22%. That might be a significant change.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam leads to more electron-molecule collisions, which effectively increases the collision rate for the gas molecules, leading to a shorter mean free path. But wait, the gas molecules' own collisions are what determine λ. If the gas molecules are colliding with electrons, which are much lighter, but how does that affect their own mean free path?

Wait, the mean free path is the average distance a gas molecule travels without colliding with another gas molecule. If the gas molecules are colliding with electrons, that's a different kind of collision and doesn't affect the mean free path λ for gas-gas collisions. Hmm, but maybe the electrons contribute to the overall scattering of the electron beam, but the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam's presence leads to more scattering of the electrons by the gas molecules, but that's a different effect. The question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules, not the electrons.

So, in the absence of the beam, mean free path is determined by gas-gas collisions. When the beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are more likely to be hit by electrons, but that doesn't directly affect their own mean free path. The gas molecules' mean free path is still governed by gas-gas collisions.

Wait, but if the gas molecules are being hit by electrons, perhaps that leads to a change in their velocity distribution, but since the temperature is the same, that shouldn't change. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Another approach: perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to be more ionized, which leads to the gas having a higher effective charge, making the gas molecules more likely to stick to the walls of the chamber. So the number of gas molecules in the compartment (n) would decrease. If n decreases, then λ increases, so λ2 > λ1. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

That would make option A (λ2 >= 1.22*λ1) a possible answer, but the problem states that Mike accurately determined λ1. So perhaps the presence of the electron beam changes the effective pressure or the number of gas molecules.

Wait, but the mass spectrometer detected the presence of gas, so the pressure is still low. Maybe the electron beam doesn't significantly change the number of gas molecules, but perhaps the mean free path is affected by another factor.

Wait, maybe electron beam-induced desorption from the walls? If the walls are being bombarded, maybe gas molecules are being released from the walls, increasing the gas density. But that would decrease the mean free path, leading to λ2 < λ1.

But I'm not sure if that's what's happening.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam induces a current, which causes a magnetic field, affecting the motion of the gas molecules. But that seems a bit far-fetched.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to become excited, increasing the effective cross-section for collisions. So σ increases, which would make λ decrease. So λ2 < λ1.

But I'm not sure how the cross-section would increase due to the beam.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas molecules to have higher vibrational or rotational energy, increasing the effective collision diameter. So σ increases, leading to a shorter mean free path.

So if σ increases, λ decreases. So λ2 < λ1.

Hmm, but without knowing the exact effect, it's hard to say. Let me think about what is more likely.

In an electron microscope, when the electron beam is on, it's a high-energy beam. The electrons can cause gas molecules to ionize, as I thought before. If some gas molecules are ionized, the number density of neutral gas molecules decreases. So n decreases. Since λ is inversely proportional to n, λ increases. So λ2 would be greater than λ1. So option A would be the answer.

But I'm not confident about this. Let me think about the initial condition. Mike created a vacuum with pressure <1e-9 Torr. So the pressure is really low, which implies a long mean free path. But when the beam is on, perhaps the beam's presence causes an increase in the effective pressure locally, but that doesn't make sense because the overall pressure is still low.

Alternatively, perhaps the electrons in the beam cause the gas molecules to have more energy, leading to more collisions and thus a shorter mean free path. But if the temperature is the same, the average energy shouldn't change.

Wait, but the electron beam has a high energy, so when it hits the gas molecules, it could cause them to gain energy, increasing their kinetic energy. But if the overall temperature of the compartment remains the same, perhaps that's not the case. I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to find a different angle.

The mean free path is given by λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P). Since T and P are the same, and assuming d is the same, λ should remain the same. But Mike saw λ2 different from λ1.

But perhaps when the beam is on, the effective pressure changes. Wait, the pressure is measured as the same, but perhaps the effective pressure for the gas molecules is different. Alternatively, the presence of the beam could cause a pressure gradient or change the way gas molecules behave.

Alternatively, maybe the vacuum pumps are not working as efficiently when the beam is on, allowing more gas molecules into the compartment. But the problem states that the pressure remains the same as measured.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought. When the electron beam is on, it might cause the gas molecules to be excited and emit light (like in fluorescence), but that doesn't directly affect the mean free path.

Alternatively, the beam could cause the gas molecules to have a higher velocity, but since the temperature is same, that can't be.

Wait, maybe the electron beam causes a change in the effective cross-section of the gas molecules. For example, if the gas molecules are polarized by the beam's electric field, their effective diameter increases, making collisions more likely and the mean free path shorter.

So σ increases, λ decreases. So λ2 < λ1.

But I'm not sure if that's a valid effect.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas molecules to ionize, and the ionized particles are more likely to stick to the walls, effectively decreasing n. That would increase λ.

So, if n decreases, λ increases. So λ2 would be greater than λ1. So which option is that?

Looking at the options:

Option A: λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1

Option C: λ2 < λ1.

So if ionization decreases n, then λ2 would be larger than λ1. So the correct conclusion would be that λ2 is larger than λ1.

But the options don't have an option where λ2 is larger than λ1 in all cases. Option A says λ2 is at least 1.22 times λ1, which is a significant increase.

But why would ionization cause a 22% increase in mean free path? Maybe the effect is more substantial. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam doesn't significantly change the number of gas molecules, but the way they move, leading to a different effective collision rate.

Wait, but the question states that the temperature remains the same, so the collision rate due to thermal motion shouldn't change.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let's think about the possible answers again.

If the electron beam doesn't change the number of gas molecules (n is same), then λ remains same, which would be option B. But Mike's observation shows a change, so B is unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam causes the gas to have a higher collision rate, making λ2 less than λ1. That would be option C.

But why would the collision rate increase? Because the beam adds more particles (electrons) which the gas molecules can collide with, but that's a different type of collision. Hmm.

Wait, even if the gas molecules collide with electrons, their own mean free path (gas-gas) might not change. So maybe the mean free path λ remains the same. But Mike found it changed, so perhaps there's another factor.

Wait, maybe the electron beam causes gas molecules to be more likely to collide with the walls, thus effectively reducing the mean free path. But that would depend on the wall's proximity.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam creates a current, leading to a magnetic field that affects the gas molecules' movement. But I don't know enough about that.

Alternatively, perhaps when the electron beam is on, the gas becomes more conductive, leading to increased ionization and gas molecules sticking to the walls, thus reducing n. So λ increases.

That would make λ2 > λ1.

But the problem is that the options don't have a clear 'could be either' option, except perhaps option A or C.

Wait, another approach: What is the mean free path in an electron microscope? In such a high-vacuum situation, the mean free path is very long. When the electron beam is on, the beam itself can cause gas molecules to be excited or ionized, which could lead to a decrease in the mean free path.

Wait, but in reality, when you have an electron beam in a vacuum, the presence of the beam can cause more scattering because the electrons in the beam can interact with the gas molecules, effectively increasing the number of collisions for the gas molecules. Wait, but the mean free path is about the distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. So if gas molecules collide with electrons (from the beam), that doesn't affect their mean free path for gas-gas collisions. So λ remains the same.

But perhaps, the mean free path for the electrons is what is changing, but the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path.

Wait, the question states that Mike made an observation about the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. So he's observing the scattering events of the electron beam with the gas. So perhaps the number of scattered electrons indicates the presence of gas molecules, and thus the mean free path of the electrons is what's being considered.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. The question says that upon initiating the beam, Mike found that the mean free path was no longer λ1 but λ2. So perhaps the mean free path in question is that of the electrons, not the gas molecules.

Wait, but the first part of the question says that Mike determined λ1 as the mean free path of the gas molecules. Then, when the beam is on, the mean free path (of the electrons?) changed.

Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read.

"He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same."

So, he found that the mean free path was λ2, which implies that he's measuring the same quantity as before. The initial mean free path was for the gas molecules, so perhaps now he's measuring the same for the gas molecules, but it's changed to λ2.

If that's the case, perhaps the presence of the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to have a shorter mean free path because they are colliding more with the electrons from the beam. Wait, but gas molecules and electrons have different masses. So when a gas molecule collides with an electron, the collision is more likely to transfer energy from the electron to the gas molecule. But does that affect the mean free path of the gas molecule?

Wait, the mean free path of the gas molecule is determined by the rate at which it collides with other gas molecules. If the gas molecule is colliding with electrons (which are much lighter), the collision frequency would be higher because electrons are moving faster. So more frequent collisions (with electrons) would effectively increase the collision rate, but the mean free path is based on collisions between gas molecules.

Wait, no. The mean free path λ is for the gas molecules to travel without colliding with another gas molecule. So if they collide with electrons, that doesn't affect their mean free path for gas-gas collisions. So λ remains the same.

But perhaps the electron beam's presence causes gas molecules to be more likely to collide with each other. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the electrons from the beam are providing an additional source of collisions for the gas molecules, leading to more frequent interactions and thus a shorter mean free path. But I'm not sure if that's how it works.

Wait, perhaps the electrons collide with the gas molecules, causing the gas molecules to have more energy. If their energy increases, their speed increases, which would increase the collision frequency between gas molecules, thus decreasing the mean free path. So λ2 < λ1.

But the problem states that the temperature remains the same, so the average energy shouldn't change. Hmm.

Wait, but the electron beam has a high energy, so gas molecules hit by electrons could gain energy, leading to a localized increase in temperature. But the question says the sample compartment's temperature remains the same, implying that any heating is negligible or compensated for.

So, I'm back to being unsure. Let me think of another angle.

In a vacuum, the presence of an electron beam can cause gas molecules to be ionized or excited. If ionization leads to a decrease in the number of neutral gas molecules, then the mean free path λ increases because n decreases. So λ2 would be bigger than λ1.

In that scenario, the mean free path λ2 would be larger than λ1. So the correct option would be A or D.

But in the options, option A says λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1. So if the number of neutral molecules decreases, this would cause λ2 to be greater than λ1.

So perhaps the correct answer is C, λ2 < λ1.

Wait, no. If n decreases, then λ = 1/(n σ) increases. So λ2 would be larger than λ1. So C is wrong.

Wait, but wait: Why would n decrease if pressure is same?

Because some gas molecules are ionized and maybe removed from the gas phase.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes gas to be pumped out more efficiently. But the pressure is still measured as the same, so that's not the case.

Hmm.

I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to make an educated guess.

The mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the pressure. If the pressure is the same, λ should be same. But Mike's observation suggests it's not.

Wait, but when the beam is on, perhaps the gas is more likely to be in a state that leads to more frequent collisions between gas molecules, perhaps because the electrons are causing the gas to be in a higher energy state, leading to more collisions.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path for the electrons is changing, but the question is about gas molecules.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes gas molecules to be more likely to scatter electrons, which affects the electron beam's mean free path. But the question says that the mean free path of the gas molecules has changed.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam's presence causes the gas molecules to have a higher effective pressure because of the increased electron density, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, maybe the presence of the beam increases the effective temperature locally, but the question says the overall temperature remains same.

Hmm. Another approach: The mean free path of gas molecules is determined by P, T, and the gas properties. If the electron beam doesn't change these, then λ remains same. But since Mike found a change, perhaps another factor is at play.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to become more highly ionized, leading to a lower number of neutral particles. So n decreases, leading to λ increases. So λ2 > λ1.

In that case, the correct answer would be option A.

But the options don't specify the exact multiple, just the relation. So if λ2 is larger, the answer is option A.

Wait, but the question says Mike accurately determined λ1 based on sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. So perhaps when the beam is on, the effective pressure increases, leading to a lower λ.

Wait, but the pressure is the same. So I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the initial analysis, the presence of the electron beam might ionize some gas molecules, reducing the neutral density, which would increase the mean free path. So λ2 > λ1.

Looking at the options, option A says λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1. So the correct answer is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves analyzing the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating under ultra-high vacuum conditions. Initially, Mike calculates the mean free path as λ1 based on the vacuum state, where the pressure is less than $10^{-9}$ Torr. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he observes a change in the mean free path to λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remains constant.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mean Free Path Basics**:  
   The mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the number density ($n$) of gas molecules and depends on the collision cross-section ($σ$). The formula is approximately:  
   $$\lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \cdot n \cdot \sigma^2}$$  
   If $n$ decreases, λ increases, and vice versa.

2. **Initial Setup (Beam Off)**:  
   Under ultra-high vacuum conditions, the pressure is extremely low, leading to a long mean free path λ1. Mike accurately calculates λ1 based on the given pressure, temperature, and compartment volume.

3. **Effect of the Electron Beam (Beam On)**:  
   When the electron beam is initiated, several effects could influence the mean free path:
   - **Ionization of Gas Molecules**: The electron beam can ionize gas molecules, reducing the number density ($n$) of neutral gas molecules. This would increase the mean free path λ, making λ2 > λ1.
   - **Electron-Gas Interactions**: While the electron beam may cause gas molecules to collide with electrons, this does not directly affect the mean free path λ, which is determined by gas-gas collisions.

4. **Temperature Constraint**:  
   The problem states that the sample compartment temperature remains constant. This rules out temperature-induced changes in molecular velocity or collision rates.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The most plausible explanation for the observed change in λ is that ionization reduces the number density of neutral gas molecules, leading to an increase in the mean free path. Thus, λ2 > λ1. Among the given options, this corresponds to **Option A: λ2 ≥ 1.22λ1**, as the increase in λ2 could be significant due to the reduced neutral gas density.

### Critical Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (λ2 ≥ 1.22λ1)**: Consistent with the ionization effect, where the reduction in neutral gas density increases λ2 significantly.  
- **Option B (λ2 = λ1)**: Incorrect, as Mike observed a change in λ.  
- **Option C (λ2 < λ1)**: Incorrect, as this would require an increase in gas density or collision rate, which is not supported by the scenario.  
- **Option D (λ1 < λ2 < 1.22λ1)**: Partially plausible but does not account for the potentially significant increase in λ2 due to ionization.

### Final Answer:
The most consistent conclusion is that λ2 is greater than or equal to 1.22λ1 due to the ionization effect reducing the number density of neutral gas molecules. 

**Answer: A**
