Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. When they measure the position, all particles are found between x=1 and x=3. I need to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm. So the wave function Ψ(x) is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wave functions usually have real and imaginary parts. Oh wait, maybe that's the entire wave function. But when you square the absolute value, the imaginary part contributes to the probability.

Wait, the probability of finding the particle in a region is the integral of |Ψ|² dx from 1 to 3. Since they're all found between 1 and 3, that means the integral of |Ψ|² from negative infinity to infinity is 1. But wait, no, the wave function is only non-zero between 1 and 3, right? Because the particles are never found outside. So the normalization condition comes into play.

Wait, normalization. The integral of |Ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1, because the total probability is 1.

So Ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. That seems a bit odd. Let me think: the modulus squared of Ψ is (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)², because the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Wait, wait, no. Ψ is a complex function. So Ψ = A - i B, where A is a/sqrt(1+x) and B is 0.5. So |Ψ|² = A² + B². So |Ψ|² = (a²)/(1 + x) + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of |Ψ|² dx is 1.

So let me write that down:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

I can split this into two integrals:

Integral [a²/(1+x) dx] from 1 to 3 + Integral [0.25 dx] from 1 to 3 = 1.

The first integral is a² times the integral of 1/(1+x) dx. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to 3, that becomes ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2).

So the first part is a² * ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the equation becomes:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202.

Then a is sqrt(0.7202). Let me calculate that. sqrt(0.7202) is about 0.8485.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close. Hmm. So is that the correct value for 'a'?

Wait, did I make any mistake?

Wait, another thought: maybe the wave function is supposed to be real? Because sometimes in such problems, the wave function is written as a real function multiplied by an exponential factor, but in this case, it's given as having an imaginary part. But the problem says the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So it's a complex function, and the probability is |Ψ|² which is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So yeah, the calculation should be correct.

So a is sqrt(0.5 / ln(2)) ≈ sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485, which is approximately 0.85, option B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\Psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the modulus squared of the wave function:

\[
|\Psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The total probability is 1, so we integrate \( |\Psi(x)|^2 \) over the region where the particle exists, \( x \in [1, 3] \):

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two integrals:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx + \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 1
\]

1. For the first integral, \(\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx\), the integral of \(\frac{1}{1+x}\) is \(\ln(1+x)\). Evaluating this from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3 = a^2 (\ln(4) - \ln(2)) = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

2. For the second integral, \(\int_1^3 0.25 dx\):

\[
\int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

Combining these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Subtract \( 0.5 \) from both sides:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5
\]

Solve for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7202
\]

Take the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7202} \approx 0.8485
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
