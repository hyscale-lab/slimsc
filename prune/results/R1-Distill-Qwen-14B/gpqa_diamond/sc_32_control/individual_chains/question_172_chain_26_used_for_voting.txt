Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. And the energy difference between these energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. 

Hmm, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between them.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( - (E_upper - E_lower)/(k*T) ). Wait, but in this case, the excitation is twice as much for star_1. So for star_1, the population of the specific energy level is twice that of star_2. But wait, the question says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe the ratio n1 / n2 = 2/1?

Wait, no. Or perhaps it's the ratio of the populations in the same level for each star. So if star_1's photosphere has iron atoms in that energy level twice as excited, that means the population of that level in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n1/n2 = 2.

But wait, I should think more carefully. The excitation here refers to the number of atoms in that energy level. So for a given energy level E, the number of atoms in E for star_1 is twice that for star_2. So n1_E / n2_E = 2.

But in LTE, each photosphere is in its own equilibrium. So each star has its own temperature, T1 and T2. So for each star, the population of the energy level E depends on its own temperature.

Wait, the Boltzmann factor is for each star's condition. So for star 1, the population is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ), and for star 2, it's exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) ). But wait, the question says that the energy difference is ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE is fixed for both stars.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact setup. Let me think again.

In the Boltzmann equation, the ratio of populations between two energy levels is given by:

(n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(kT))

But in this problem, perhaps we're considering the same energy level for both stars. Hmm, no, wait, I think the question is about the same transition for both stars. So the same energy difference ΔE is used for both stars.

Wait, the problem says that the energy difference between the considered energy levels is the same for both stars, 1.38e-23 J.

So for each star, the ratio of the population of the excited level to the lower level is governed by the Boltzmann factor with their respective temperatures.

But the problem states that the number of excited iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 is twice that in star_2. So maybe for star_1, the population in the excited state is n1, and for star_2, it's n2, and n1 = 2n2.

Wait, but each star's photosphere is in LTE, so each has its own T. So for each star, the ratio of populations between the excited level and the ground level (or another lower level) depends on their temperature.

But I'm a bit confused about the setup. Let me try to model it.

Let me denote for star_1: the ratio of the excited level population (E_upper) to the lower level (E_lower) is (n1_upper / n1_lower) = (g1/g0) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), where g1 and g0 are the statistical weights of the upper and lower levels.

Similarly, for star_2: (n2_upper / n2_lower) = (g2/g0) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But the question says that the excited level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Wait, but without knowing the lower level populations, how do we compare the two?

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the same lower level for both stars. So the ratio for star_1 is (n1_upper / n1_lower) = (g1/g0) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star_2 it's (n2_upper / n2_lower) = (g2/g0) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But the problem states that the excited atoms in star_1 are twice as many as in star_2. But wait, that would require knowing the proportion of the lower level in each star. Or perhaps we can assume that the lower level population is the same in both stars. No, that might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is simplifying things by assuming that the ratio of the upper level to the lower level is given, and that for star_1, this ratio is twice that of star_2.

Wait, the question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So perhaps the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But wait, that would depend on both the temperature and the number of atoms, which might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is measured as the fraction of atoms in the excited state. Then, the ratio would be (n1_upper / n1_total) compared to (n2_upper / n2_total). But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the same lower level for both stars, so the ratio n_upper/n_lower is being compared. Let me think this way.

So for star_1:

(n1_upper / n1_lower) = (g1/g0) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

Similarly, for star_2:

(n2_upper / n2_lower) = (g2/g0) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But if we're given that the excitation is twice as much in star_1, perhaps (n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower). But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. The problem is a bit ambiguous in that respect.

Alternatively, perhaps the fraction of atoms in the upper level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So (n1_upper / (n1_upper + n1_lower)) = 2 * (n2_upper / (n2_upper + n2_lower)). But that would complicate the equations, as the denominators might not be the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the ratio of the excited to lower levels. So maybe the problem is assuming that (n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2*(n2_upper / n2_lower). But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the ions are in the same energy level for both stars, and the number of excited atoms is twice. But let's think about the Boltzmann factor.

Wait, perhaps a simpler approach is to write the ratio of the populations for each star.

Let me denote the statistical weights as g1 and g2 for the upper levels of each star, but perhaps they're the same? The question doesn't specify, so maybe we can assume g1 = g2, or that the ratio is the same.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the same transition, so the same upper and lower levels, so their statistical weights are the same for both stars. So for star_1, the ratio is (n1_upper / n1_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star_2, (n2_upper / n2_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But the problem says that the number of excited atoms is twice as much. So perhaps (n1_upper) = 2 * (n2_upper).

But that doesn't directly relate their ratios unless we know more about their lower levels. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the upper level to the lower level’s population is what's being considered, and the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Wait, let's think again. The problem says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the fraction of excited atoms is higher. For example, star_1 has 20% of its iron in that excited state, while star_2 has 10%. Or perhaps it's the number per unit volume.

But regardless, let's think about the ratio of the populations between the two stars.

So for each star, the fraction of atoms in the excited state (n_upper) compared to the ground state (n_lower) is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So, for star_1: (n1_upper / n1_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

Similarly, for star_2: (n2_upper / n2_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

The problem states that star_1's excitation is twice as much as star_2's. So perhaps the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So (n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower).

But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the number of excited atoms is twice as much, but that would depend on the total number of atoms, which we don't know.

But maybe the problem is treating the ratio as (n_upper / n_lower) for star_1 is twice that for star_2. So,

n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower).

But substituting in the Boltzmann expressions:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, that might make sense. Let's write that equation.

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) ) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2) )

Which simplifies to:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Hmm, but let's see. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me re-express the initial condition.

Wait, if star_1's excitation ratio is twice that of star_2, then (n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2*(n2_upper / n2_lower).

But using the Boltzmann equation for each star, (n_upper / n_lower) is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)).

So,

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Take ln on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Rearranging:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Hmm, but I can factor this as:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )) = ln(2)

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, the question is about finding the correct equation for the temperatures. So I think the options are about the form involving ln(2) and the temperatures.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

No, because in the equation I derived, it's ΔE/(k) multiplied by that term equals ln(2). So perhaps the given options ignore the ΔE term, but that doesn't make sense because the equation wouldn't hold unless we include ΔE.

Wait, the question's options don't have any ΔE in them. So perhaps I have made a wrong assumption in setting up the equations.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me consider the ratio of the excitation ratios.

For star_1: (n1_upper / n1_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

For star_2: (n2_upper / n2_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

The problem says that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But without knowing the total number of atoms, perhaps we can assume that the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) is twice for star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, but the problem states that the excitation is twice as much. So perhaps (n1_upper) = 2 * (n2_upper).

But that's not directly helpful unless we know the lower level populations.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So,

(n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower).

But since each star has its own T, substituting the Boltzmann expressions, I get:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Which leads to the same equation as before.

Wait, let's take logs:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2) )

Rearranging:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Which can be rewritten as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Hmm. Now, let's think about the options.

The options give equations that ln(2) equals some function of T1 and T2.

Looking at option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Wait, in the equation I have, I have:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

But the options don't show any ΔE or k. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the ratio of the two temperatures. Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that the ratio of the populations is (n1_upper/n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower), but that's same as before.

Wait, but wait, the question says that the excitation is twice as much. So perhaps the ratio (n_upper / n_total) is twice as much for star_1.

n_upper/n_total would be the fraction of excited atoms. So for star_1, (n1_upper)/(n1_upper + n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper)/(n2_upper + n2_lower).

But that complicates things because it introduces denominators. However, perhaps we can assume that n_upper + n_lower is the same for both stars, but that's probably not a safe assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the ratio of the excitation for each star relative to a common lower level. But maybe this is getting too complicated.

Wait, another approach: the problem gives the energy difference between the levels, ΔE. And since the excitation is higher in star_1, perhaps star_1 has a higher temperature than star_2. Because higher temperatures make it easier to excite atoms to higher energy levels.

So, T1 > T2.

In the Boltzmann equation, the exponent is negative, so higher T leads to higher population in the upper level.

Now, the ratio for star_1 is:

n1_upper / n1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star_2:

n2_upper / n2_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

If the excitation is twice as much, perhaps n1_upper/n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower).

So,

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Taking natural logs,

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Rearranging,

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k),

ΔE/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Which can be written as,

ΔE/(k) * [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

But the options don't include ΔE or k. So perhaps I'm not on the right track.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the ratio of the two temperatures.

Let me denote T1 = x T2, where x is a factor greater than 1 because T1 > T2.

So,

ΔE/(k) * [ (x T2 - T2) / (x T2 * T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Simplify numerator and denominator:

ΔE/(k) * [ (T2 (x-1)) ) / (x T2^2) ) ] = ln(2)

Simplify:

ΔE/(k) * ( (x-1) ) / (x T2^2 ) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but I still have T2 in there, which complicates things. I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the reciprocal of the temperatures.

Let me write the equation again:

ΔE/(k) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But I'm stuck because the options don't have any ΔE.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio of the excitation probabilities and not the actual population ratios.

Wait, maybe the question is about the relative probabilities, which would be the same as the ratio of the Boltzmann factors.

Wait, another approach: since both are in LTE, perhaps the ratio of the excitation probabilities is given by the ratio of their respective Boltzmann factors for the same energy difference.

Wait, but in the problem, star_1's excitation is twice that of star_2. So perhaps the probability for an atom to be excited in star_1 is twice that in star_2.

So,

P1 = 2 P2

Where P is the probability of excitation, which is given by the Boltzmann factor.

But wait, the probability is the ratio of the excited state to the total states.

Alternatively, perhaps P = (n_upper)/(n_upper + n_lower) = [g_upper exp(-ΔE/(kT)) ] / [g_upper exp(-ΔE/(kT)) + g_lower ]

Assuming that the lower level has a statistical weight of g_lower. But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio of the probabilities, so:

P1 / P2 = 2

But this leads to a more complicated equation with the sum of exponentials, which might not be helpful.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to consider the ratio of the excitation as the ratio of the upper to lower levels, as I did earlier.

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking logs:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Rearranging:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ] = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

So,

ln(2) = [ ΔE/(k) ] * [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

But looking at the options, none include ΔE or k. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the ratio of the population in the upper level relative to the ground level, and that the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So,

(n1_upper/n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower)

Which is the same as:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Which leads to the same equation as before.

But again, the options don't involve ΔE. So perhaps I'm missing a step where I can eliminate ΔE.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the ratio of the two temperatures.

Wait, if I rearrange the equation:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1-T2)/(T1 T2)

But the options are in terms of T1 and T2 without any other constants.

So perhaps I can express (T1 - T2) in terms of T1 and T2, but without knowing ΔE or k, I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the initial condition. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The problem says that the iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2.

Ah, perhaps 'twice as excited' refers to the occupation probability being twice. So the occupation probability P is given by the Boltzmann factor, P = (g_upper/g_lower) exp(-ΔE/(kT)).

If we assume that the statistical weights are the same for both stars (g_upper = g_lower for both), which might not be the case, but perhaps the problem is simplifying this. Then, the ratio of the probabilities is 2:1.

So,

P1 = 2 P2

Which would imply:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Which brings us back to the same equation.

So, working through the equation again, I have:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ]

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ]

But again, without knowing ΔE or k, I can’t see how to proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the energy difference ΔE is the same for both stars, but not considering its actual value. So perhaps the equation can be rewritten in terms of T1 and T2 without ΔE.

But that doesn't seem possible because ΔE is part of the equation.

Wait, perhaps I should express the equation in terms of the ratio of the temperatures.

Let me denote the ratio of temperatures as r = T1/T2.

Then,

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) [ (1/T2) - (1/(r T2)) ) ]

= (ΔE/(k T2)) [1/r - 1 ]

= (ΔE/(k T2)) ( (1 - r)/r )

Wait, but I'm not sure if this helps, as I still have T2 in the equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can solve for the ratio (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) in terms of ln(2) and ΔE.

But the options don't involve ΔE, so I'm stuck.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is comparing the excitation energies using the ratio of the Boltzmann factors. So,

(n1_upper / n1_lower) / (n2_upper / n2_lower) ) = 2.

Which, using the Boltzmann equation, would give:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) = 2

Which simplifies to:

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )) ) = 2

Taking the natural log,

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Which is the same as before.

So,

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2 )

But the options don't include ΔE or k. Therefore, perhaps the correct equation isn't among the options, but that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Maybe the equation for the population ratio is actually the opposite. Let me think again: the population ratio (n_upper/n_lower) is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), which is larger for higher temperatures. So if star_1 has more excitation (twice as much), then (n1_upper/n1_lower) = 2 (n2_upper/n2_lower).

But that would imply that:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Which leads to the same equation as before.

Hmm. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Hmm, that's the same as (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2)

Which is similar to the equation I have, except that in my equation, it's multiplied by (ΔE/k).

But none of the options have that factor. So perhaps the given equation is correct but without considering ΔE, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the energy difference per atom, but I don't think that changes anything.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the ratio of the two probabilities, which would be (n_upper / n_lower) for each star, and that ratio is 2.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the number of excited atoms is twice as much, but that would require knowing the total number of atoms, which isn't given.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the ratio of the excited states, so (n_upper) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But then, without knowing the lower states, it's hard to model.

Wait, let's think of it in terms of the ratio of the two equations.

For star_1: (n1_upper) = (g1/g0) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) n1_lower

Similarly for star_2: (n2_upper) = (g2/g0) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) n2_lower

If we take the ratio,

(n1_upper) / (n2_upper) = [ (g1/g0) / (g2/g0) ) ] * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) * (n1_lower / n2_lower )

But without knowing the ratio of the lower level populations, this leads to complications.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the lower level is the same for both stars, so g1 = g2 and n1_lower = n2_lower. But that's not necessarily true.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is taking the ratio of the two upper levels, assuming g1 = g2, and n1_lower = n2_lower. Then,

n1_upper / n2_upper = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Which equals exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

And the problem states that this ratio is 2.

So,

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

Taking the natural log:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2 )

But again, the options don't have ΔE or k. So perhaps the problem is considering a specific value for ΔE/(k) that would make the equation match one of the options.

Wait, let's compute ΔE/(k).

ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J.

k is Boltzmann's constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

So,

ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Ah, that's a key insight! So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So substituting back into the equation,

ln(2) = (1 K) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2 )

Which simplifies to:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Which matches option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the correct answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves two stars in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), where the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). The goal is to determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of the stars.

In LTE, the distribution of atoms in energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_{\text{upper}} \) and \( g_{\text{lower}} \) are the statistical weights of the upper and lower energy levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For simplicity, it is assumed that the statistical weights are the same for both stars (\( g_{\text{upper}} = g_{\text{lower}} \)).

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. This implies:

\[
\frac{n_{1,\text{upper}}}{n_{1,\text{lower}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2,\text{upper}}}{n_{2,\text{lower}}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions for each star:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \( \Delta E / k \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Simplifying \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) to \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \) (since \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)):

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
