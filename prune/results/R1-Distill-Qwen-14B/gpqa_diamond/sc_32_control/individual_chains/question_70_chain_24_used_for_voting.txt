Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully and take notes. The question is about a series of reactions, and I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

First, let's break down the reactions step by step.

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, solid A with gas B... using 8 equivalents. I'm thinking maybe a metal reacting with a halogen, but I'm not sure yet. The product C is bright red, which often makes me think of something like sulfur or maybe a product like Iron(III) oxide, but that's more dark red. Wait, bright red solids... maybe it's mercury(II) oxide? No, that's a dark red. Alternatively, maybe something like lead dioxide is dark brown. Hmm. Or perhaps it's a transition metal compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction that forms a precipitate.

Wait, let's think about the second reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce extremely hazardous product E. Then, C reacting with water reforms A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it gives back A, and two acids. That suggests that C is perhaps a metal oxide because when metal oxides react with water, they form metal hydroxides. But in this case, it's forming two acids. Wait, maybe C is a salt that reacts with water to form an acid. Alternatively, if C is a compound that contains both acidic and basic properties, like a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. For instance, if C is something like sodium carbonate, which when hydrolyzed would give sodium bicarbonate, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride or something else.

Wait, but the formation of two different acids when C reacts with water. Let me think. Suppose C is a metal nitride, such as Mg3N2. When Mg3N2 reacts with water, it forms Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm. Alternatively, if C is a metal oxide, like Al2O3, which is amphoteric. Al2O3 + H2O gives Al(OH)3, but that's a single product. So maybe it's a different oxide. Wait, if C is a sulfide, like FeS. If FeS reacts with water, it might not do much, unless it's in an acidic solution, but that's not just adding water. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfate or another salt. Alternatively, perhaps it's a more complex situation. Let me think about the third part: when C reacts with water, it forms A, F, and G. So the reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G. So C is a compound that breaks down into A and two acids when hydrolyzed. So if F is a strong acid and G is weak, maybe C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait, another angle: D is a gas that reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So D and B combine to make H. If H is a solvent, maybe H is something like ethanol or water. But D and B reacting in a 1:1 ratio... maybe B is H2O and D is something else? But no, because B is a gas. So if B is a gas, maybe D is a gas that reacts with B to form a solvent. For example, if B is H2O (as a gas, which is steam), and D is something like CO2, which would make H as something else. But wait, D and B (both gases) reacting in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So possible reactions: maybe B is H2O and D is NH3. Wait, but NH3 is a gas, and H2O is a liquid, but in gaseous form, steam. Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is another gas, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a halogen, like Cl2, and D is another gas. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is H2O, D is something else. Wait, let's think about H being a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, acetone, etc. But H is formed from D and B.

Wait, another approach: think about the second reaction. C + 2 D → E. E is extremely hazardous. So perhaps E is something like phosgene (but that's a gas). Or maybe it's something like chlorine trifluoride, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, E could be a highly reactive compound like HCl gas, but that's not extremely hazardous in small amounts, but perhaps it's more about the context.

Wait, let's get back to the first reaction. Solid A reacts with gas B (8 equivalents) to form C. So it's a reaction where A is in solid form, and B is a gas, and they react to form C. 8 equivalents suggests that the stoichiometry is perhaps 1 A : 8 B, so maybe A is a metal and B is a halogen. For example, if A is copper and B is chlorine, but 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of Cu. But wait, typical reactions: Cu + Cl2 → CuCl2. The stoichiometry is 1 Cu : 1 Cl2. So 8 equivalents would suggest 8 moles of Cl2, but that's a lot. Alternatively, maybe A is Fe and B is Cl2. Fe reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3. So, Fe + 3/2 Cl2 → FeCl3. So if 8 equivalents of Cl2, maybe the reaction is Fe + 8 Cl2 → something? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal sulfide. But I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should think about the third reaction again.

C reacts with water to give A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it produces a strong acid, a weak acid, and solid A. So perhaps C is a salt that when hydrolyzed gives both acids. Maybe C contains two different anions, each of which can hydrolyze into an acid.

Wait, let's think about a nitride. For example, Ca3N2 reacts with water: Ca3N2 + 6 H2O → 3 Ca(OH)2 + 2 NH3↑. But that would produce NH3, which is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a carbide. For example, CaC2 reacts with water to produce C2H2 (acetylene) and Ca(OH)2. But that's just one acid, Ca(OH)2 is a base. Not helpful.

Another thought: perhaps C is a metal carbonate. For example, Na2CO3 reacts with water, but doesn't hydrolyze much. Wait, but when a carbonate reacts with water, it can form bicarbonate and hydroxide. Wait, but that's not two acids. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfate. No, that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with gas D, it produces E. So C is reacting with D in a 2:1 ratio? No, the second reaction has C reacting with 2 equivalents of D to form E. So perhaps the stoichiometry is 1 C : 2 D → E.

If E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a highly toxic gas like phosgene (but I'm not sure). Alternatively, maybe E is something like sulfur trioxide, but I'm not certain.

Wait, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So B and D are gases, and their ratio is 1:1. So possible reactions: perhaps B is H2O and D is NH3. Wait, but H2O is a liquid under standard conditions, unless it's steam. Alternatively, maybe B is CO2 and D is something else. Or maybe B is O2 and D is H2, but that would form H2O, which is a solvent. But O2 and H2 reaction would require specific conditions (like combustion), but they react in 2:1 ratio to form H2O. Wait, but H is a solvent, so H2O is a possibility. But wait, in that case, B is O2 and D is H2. So O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O. But the ratio is 1:2, but the question says 1:1. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe B is SO2 and D is O2? No, that doesn't form a solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is NH3. Cl2 + NH3 → NH2Cl, but that's a solid, not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe D is H2O and B is another gas. Hmm, not sure yet.

Let me try to think of a compound C that upon hydrolysis gives two different acids. Maybe C is a mixture of salts, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, C could be a sulfite or something else.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide. For example, if C is FeS, then reacting with water wouldn't produce strong and weak acids. Alternatively, perhaps it's a more complex compound.

Another thought: if C is a metal oxide that's amphoteric. For example, Al2O3. Al2O3 reacts with water to form Al(OH)3, but that's a single product. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the fact that F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So when C hydrolyzes, it produces two different acids. The only scenario I can think of is that C is a salt that can hydrolyze to form two different acids. For example, if C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, but that would typically form a strong base and a weak acid upon hydrolysis. Wait, no. Let me think. For example, consider sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to form bicarbonate and hydroxide: Na2CO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + CO2↑. But CO2 is a weak acid (carbonic acid), but NaOH is a strong base. Hmm, but in this case, it's forming a base and an acid. So in that scenario, the reaction would produce a base and a weak acid. But in the problem, C reacts with water to produce A (a solid), and two acids F and G. So perhaps C is a salt that upon hydrolysis releases two different acids.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is a mixture of two salts that each hydrolyze into different acids. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe C is a nitride, like Mg3N2. Mg3N2 reacts with water to form Mg(OH)2 and NH3. Mg(OH)2 is a weak base, while NH3 is a weak base. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate of a weak acid. But I'm not getting it.

Wait, I think I'm stuck on this part. Let me think about the reactions again.

First reaction: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red solid).

Second: C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous).

Third: C + H2O → A (solid) + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

Fourth: D + B → H (solvent).

Hmm. Let's think about H first. H is a solvent formed from D and B. So D and B are gases, and when they react in 1:1 ratio, they make H. So possible H could be H2O (a solvent), but that would require B and D to be H2 and O2. But H2 and O2 react in a 2:1 ratio to form H2O. So that's not 1:1. Another possibility: maybe B is CO2 and D is something else. Wait, CO2 + H2O would just make carbonic acid, not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is NH3 and D is something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: D is a gas that reacts with B to form H, a solvent. Suppose H is ethanol. Then, D and B would need to combine to make ethanol. For example, if B is H2O (a gas, as steam) and D is C2H5OH (but that's a liquid). No, that can't be. Alternatively, maybe B is H2O and D is another gas; perhaps D is C2H5OH isn't a gas. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps H is acetone. But acetone is (propanone), which is a solvent. How would it be formed from B and D as gases? Maybe from a reaction between CO and H2? For example, the Fischer-Tropsch process, but that makes longer hydrocarbons. Alternatively, maybe D is CO and B is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps H is methanol. Methanol is a solvent. So how to make methanol from B and D, which are gases, in a 1:1 ratio.

Methanol can be formed from CO and H2 in a 1:2 ratio (like in the hydrogenation of CO), but that's 1:2. Alternatively, maybe it's from CO2 and H2. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the possible compounds.

Let me try to think about E. E is extremely hazardous, formed from C and D in a 2:1 ratio. So maybe E is something like phosgene (but I'm not certain), or perhaps it's a highly toxic gas like Cl2. But in that case, perhaps C is something that reacts with Cl2 to form E. Wait, but I'm not seeing it.

Another approach: think about molecular symmetry. The question is about the symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

Molecular symmetry groups are determined by the highest symmetry operations present. For example, D4h has a high level of symmetry, including a four-fold rotation axis, mirror planes, etc. D∞h would be for linear molecules with infinite symmetry, like O2 or CO2. C2 would be a two-fold rotation axis. C2v would have a two-fold rotation and a vertical mirror plane.

So, what are the possible structures of E based on the reactions?

If E is a linear molecule, like CO2 or HCN, then it would have D∞h symmetry. If it's a molecule with a four-fold axis, like methane (but methane is tetrahedral, so it'sTd symmetry, not among the options). Alternatively, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule, which would likely have D∞h symmetry. But if it's a bent molecule, like H2O, which has C2v symmetry. But H2O is not extremely hazardous, though.

Alternatively, if E is O3 (ozone), which has a bent structure with D3h symmetry, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, another thought: E could be phosgene, which is O=C(Cl)2. Phosgene is a toxic gas. Its structure is a central carbon double-bonded to O and two Cl atoms. So, the structure is trigonal planar, with the molecule having a three-fold axis. The symmetry group of phosgene is D3h. But D3h isn't an option here. So perhaps that's not it.

Wait, maybe E is something else. Let's think about the possible structures. Alternatively, E could be a linear molecule like SO2, but SO2 has a bent structure with D3h symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps it's a molecule with a center of inversion and a two-fold axis.

Wait, another angle: the reaction where C reacts with D to form E. If C is a metal chloride, and D is another chloride, but that may not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate and D is something else. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the initial reaction again. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B. Maybe A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas. For example, if A is copper metal and B is chlorine gas (Cl2). The reaction would be Cu + Cl2 → CuCl2. But the stoichiometry is 1 Cu : 1 Cl2. So 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of Cu, which would lead to CuCl2 plus excess Cl2? Or perhaps it's a different product. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where multiple Cl atoms are added.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps A is a metal and B is a halogen. For example, if A is Fe and B is Cl2. Fe reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3, with the reaction Fe + 3 Cl2 → 2 FeCl3. So if 8 equivalents of Cl2 are used, that would imply a 1:8 ratio. Maybe the product is FeCl4? But FeCl4 is more commonly FeCl3, unless it's under specific conditions.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal sulfide, but I'm not making progress here.

Wait, perhaps C is a compound that when hydrolyzed gives two acids. Let's think of such a compound. Maybe C is a mixture of two salts, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a salt that can hydrolyze in two different ways. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if C is a mixture of two different compounds, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe C is a complex salt. For example, a double salt that upon hydrolysis releases two different acids. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide. Let's say C is FeS. FeS reacts with water, but under certain conditions, it can react with water to produce H2S and Fe(OH)2. H2S is a weak acid, but Fe(OH)2 is a base. So that would give a base and a weak acid, but in the problem, both F and G are acids. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. If C is NH4NO3 (ammonium nitrate), but that's a solid. When it reacts with water, it would hydrolyze into NH4OH (a weak acid, but more like NH4+ and NO3- ions. Wait, actually, ammonium nitrate is highly soluble and doesn't react much with water. So that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate. For example, sodium carbonate, Na2CO3. If it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to form NaOH and CO2. So, CO2 is a weak acid (since it forms carbonic acid in water), and NaOH is a strong base. But in the problem, both F and G are acids. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: perhaps C is a metal sulfite, like CaSO3. When it reacts with water, it might hydrolyze. But sulfites are generally unstable in water. CaSO3 + H2O → Ca(OH)2 + SO2↑. SO2 is a gas and a weak acid (as H2SO3). Ca(OH)2 is a strong base. So again, we get a base and an acid, but the problem states two acids.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to think about E's structure and its symmetry.

If E is a diatomic molecule, like O2, N2, H2, etc., it would have D∞h symmetry. But O2 isn't extremely hazardous. Alternatively, perhaps E is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, like CO (carbon monoxide) which is toxic. CO has a linear structure with a polar bond, and its symmetry group is D∞h.

Wait, but CO's structure is O=C, which is linear. The point group would be D∞h. So if E is CO, then the symmetry group would be D∞h. But does that fit with the reactions?

Alternatively, if E is phosgene (O=CCl2), which has a structure of O=C(Cl)2. That's a trigonal planar molecule, and its symmetry group is D3h, which isn't one of the options.

Wait, another possibility: E could be a molecule like SO2, which is bent and has a D3h symmetry. But again, that's not an option.

Alternatively, E could be a molecule with C2v symmetry. For example, H2O has C2v symmetry when in a bent structure. But H2O isn't extremely hazardous. Alternatively, maybe E is something like O3 (ozone), which has a bent structure and D3h symmetry. Again, not an option.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps E is a molecule with a two-fold rotation axis and a mirror plane, like C2v symmetry. For example, H2O has C2v symmetry. So if E is H2O, but that's not extremely hazardous. Alternatively, maybe E is something else.

Wait, perhaps E is a molecule like CH4, which has tetrahedral symmetry (Td), but that's not an option. So maybe it's not a tetrahedral molecule.

Wait, perhaps E is a molecule like NH3, which has a trigonal pyramidal structure. The point group is C3v, which isn't an option either.

Hmm. Another thought: If E is a molecule with D4h symmetry, which is a high symmetry group. For example, a square planar molecule like [Ni(CN)4]^2- has D4h symmetry, but that's an ion, not a neutral molecule. Alternatively, perhaps E is a linear molecule with four equivalent atoms, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, let's think about the first reaction again. If A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas, perhaps the reaction is 8 equivalents of B. Let's say B is O2. Then, A could be Fe. Fe reacting with O2 in 8 equivalents? The typical reaction is Fe + O2 → Fe3O4, which is 4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe3O4. So 4 Fe : 3 O2 ratio. But the problem says 8 equivalents. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's another reaction.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the first reaction is the formation of a metal oxide. For example, copper reacting with oxygen to form CuO. But that's a 2:1 ratio (2 Cu : O2 → 2 CuO), so 2 Cu : 1 O2. But the problem says 8 equivalents, which is a lot. So maybe the reaction is more intense.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal and B is a halogen, and the reaction forms a compound with multiple halogen atoms. For example, A is Fe and B is Cl2. Fe reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3. The reaction is 2 Fe + 3 Cl2 → 2 FeCl3. So 3 moles of Cl2 per 2 moles of Fe. So 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of Fe. That would make FeCl4, but FeCl4 isn't a common product. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps A is a non-metal, like sulfur. Sulfur reacting with oxygen to form SO3. The reaction is S + O2 → SO3. The stoichiometry is 1 S : 3 O2. So 8 equivalents of O2 would imply 8 moles per mole of S, which would produce 8/3 moles of SO3. But SO3 is a gas, and perhaps C is that. But SO3 is colorless, not bright red. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a compound that is bright red. For example, mercury(II) oxide is red, but it's a dark red. Alternatively, perhaps it's lead dioxide, PbO2, which is dark brown. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is Fe(OH)3, which is a reddish-brown solid, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a different oxide.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide. For example, FeS is a black solid. Hmm, not bright red.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the reaction where C reacts with water to give F and G as acids. So if F is strong and G is weak, perhaps F is HCl (strong acid) and G is H2S (weak acid). So C would need to contain both Cl- and S^2- ions. Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed salt, like a sulfide and chloride. For example, perhaps a salt that contains both Cl- and S^2- ions. But when C is hydrolyzed, it could produce HCl and H2S, which are strong and weak acids, respectively. So maybe C is something like CuS, but CuS is a solid that doesn't hydrolyze easily.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a thiocyanate, but that's a stretch.

Wait, another idea: perhaps C is a nitrate. For example, if C is Ca(NO3)2, but that doesn't fit with producing two acids upon hydrolysis.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider the options for E's symmetry and think of which one makes sense based on the reactions.

The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

If E is a molecule with D4h symmetry, it would have a four-fold rotation axis, mirror planes, etc. Examples include square planar complexes, but those are usually ions. Alternatively, perhaps E is a linear molecule with a center of symmetry, which would make it D∞h. For example, O2 or N2.

Wait, another possibility: E could be a molecule like SF4. SF4 has a seesaw geometry, which has a point group of C2v. Alternatively, perhaps E is something else.

Wait, let me think about the second reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. If E is a diatomic molecule, like O2 or Cl2, but those are the starting materials, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, E could be a more complex molecule.

Wait, perhaps E is a chloride, like ClOCl (phosgene), which is O=C(Cl)2. But as I thought earlier, its point group is D3h, not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like SO2, which has a bent structure and D3h symmetry. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps E is a molecule with D4h symmetry, which would be a square planar molecule, but that's more for coordination complexes. Alternatively, maybe it's a linear molecule with certain symmetry elements.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about each option and what E could be.

Option C is D∞h, which is for linear molecules with a center of symmetry. For example, O2, CO, NO, etc. So if E is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, it could be CO or O2.

Wait, in the second reaction, C reacts with D to form E. If E is CO, which is a toxic gas, that could fit. Then, D would have to be O2, and C would be a carbon source. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if E is O2, that doesn't make sense as it's a diatomic oxygen, which is not extremely hazardous on its own.

Another thought: perhaps E is a molecule like HCN. HCN is a toxic gas. Its structure is linear, so it would have D∞h symmetry. So if E is HCN, then the point group is D∞h. So option C would be the answer.

But how would that fit with the reactions? Let's see.

If E is HCN, then the reaction C + 2 D → HCN. So D would have to be a source of CN- or something. Hmm.

Wait, D is a gas that reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If H is CH3OH (methanol), then D and B would need to form methanol. For example, if B is H2O (steam) and D is CO. Then, CO + H2O → conditions could form methanol. But that reaction typically requires a catalyst and specific conditions, like the Fischer-Tropsch process. Alternatively, perhaps D is CO and B is H2. Then, CO + 3 H2 → 2 CH3OH, but that's a 1:3 ratio, which doesn't fit the 1:1 ratio.

Alternatively, if B is H2O and D is CH3OH, but that wouldn't fit because D is a gas, and CH3OH is a liquid.

Alternatively, perhaps D is NH3 and B is something else. But I'm not making progress here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the first reaction again. If A is carbon and B is O2, then the reaction would be carbon burning to form CO or CO2. But the product C is bright red. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is a metal oxide that is bright red. For example, perhaps it's a manganese oxide, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a chromium compound, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide, but that doesn't fit with the color.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, sodium nitride (Na3N), which is a yellow solid. But that's not bright red.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the symmetry options.

If E has D∞h symmetry, it's a linear molecule. So E could be O2, CO, HCN, etc. O2 isn't extremely hazardous, but CO and HCN are. So E is likely HCN, which has D∞h symmetry. So the answer would be option C) D∞h.

Alternatively, if E is a diatomic molecule like O2, but that doesn't fit the extremely hazardous part. So HCN seems more likely.

So, based on this reasoning, the molecular symmetry group of E is D∞h, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the determination of the molecular symmetry group of product E. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The bright red color suggests C could be a compound like a metal oxide or sulfide. However, the exact identity of A and B is unclear, but C is likely a compound that can undergo further reactions.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, described as extremely hazardous. This suggests E is a toxic compound, possibly a gas or highly reactive species. Options for E include toxic molecules like HCN (hydrogen cyanide), which is linear and has high symmetry.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). This indicates C is likely a salt or compound that hydrolyzes to yield these acids. However, the exact nature of C remains ambiguous.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This suggests D and B combine to form a common solvent like water (H2O) or methanol (CH3OH). However, the exact identity of H is not critical to determining the symmetry of E.

5. **Symmetry Analysis**: The options for the molecular symmetry group of E are:
   - **C2**: A two-fold rotation axis.
   - **D4h**: A high-symmetry group with a four-fold rotation axis and mirror planes.
   - **D∞h**: Symmetry of linear molecules with infinite symmetry, such as O2, CO, or HCN.
   - **C2v**: A two-fold rotation axis and a vertical mirror plane, seen in molecules like H2O.

   E is described as extremely hazardous, which aligns with toxic gases like HCN. HCN is a linear molecule with **D∞h** symmetry, making this the most plausible option.

Based on the reactions and symmetry considerations, the molecular symmetry group of E is **D∞h**.

Answer: C
