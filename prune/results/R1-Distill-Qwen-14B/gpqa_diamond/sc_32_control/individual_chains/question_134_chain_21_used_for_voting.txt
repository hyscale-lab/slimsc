Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, let's see. I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The formula is usually q = n * ΔH, where ΔH is the enthalpy per mole of reaction.

Wait, the problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I think I need to figure out how much each contributes to the neutralization reaction.

First, I'll write down the volumes and molarities:

- HCl: 500 mL, 0.2 M
- H2SO4: 300 mL, 0.3 M
- Ba(OH)2: 200 mL, 0.5 M

I remember that HCl is a strong acid and H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. But wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so it can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and I think it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH^-.

The neutralization reaction is acid + base → salt + water. The enthalpy change for this is usually given per mole of H+ reacting with OH-.

So the first step is to calculate the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base.

Let me calculate the moles of H+ in HCl. Since HCl is monoprotic, each mole gives one H+.

Moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters)
HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole gives 2 H+. So moles H2SO4 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Total moles of H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now, the base is Ba(OH)2. Each mole gives 2 OH^- ions. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So OH- moles = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, so the H+ is 0.28 moles and OH- is 0.2 moles. But which one is the limiting reactant? Because the neutralization is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the H+ and OH- will react in a 1:1 ratio.

So the moles that react are the smaller of the two. OH- is 0.2 moles, which is less than H+ (0.28). So all the OH- will react, leaving some H+ unreacted.

So the total moles of H+ that react is 0.2 moles, and OH- is 0.2 moles.

But wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ reacting. Oh wait, no, wait. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually given as the energy change when one mole of H+ from an acid reacts with one mole of OH- from a base to form water. So for each mole of H+ and OH- reacting, the enthalpy change is ΔH (which is usually negative, exothermic).

So in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH- react. So the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 moles * ΔH per mole.

Wait, but what's the standard ΔH for neutralization? I think it's about -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and strong bases. Wait, but wait, sometimes it's given as -57.3 kJ/mol. Or is it per mole of H+?

Wait, correction: The enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and strong base is approximately -57.1 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-). So each mole of H+ reacting gives off about 57.1 kJ of heat.

Wait, but wait. Some sources say that the standard enthalpy of neutralization is -57.3 kJ per mole of H2O formed. Since each H+ and OH- make one H2O, that would be the same as per mole of H+ or OH-.

So in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ reacting would release 0.2 * 57.3 kJ. Let me calculate that.

0.2 * 57.3 = 11.46 kJ. Since the reaction is exothermic, the enthalpy change is negative, so -11.46 kJ. Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, but wait, the units are in kJ. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in units.

Wait, the options are a mix of kcal and kJ. Let me check, which units are required. The question says, "Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization"—the units would typically be in kJ, but some options are in kcal. Wait, maybe I should convert kJ to kcal?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal. Let me think: 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So 11.46 kJ is about 11.46 / 4.184 ≈ 2.738 kcal. So approximately -2.74 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal and option C is -3.80. Hmm, option A is close to what I calculated.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I correctly calculate the moles of H+ and OH-? Let me double-check.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

So H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent, so 0.2 mol H+ reacts.

So 0.2 mol × 57.3 kJ/mol → 11.46 kJ = 11.46 kJ. So in kJ, that's about -11.46 kJ. But none of the options match that exactly except option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that Ba(OH)2 is a strong base but when it neutralizes with H2SO4, the reaction could require more H+.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think differently. Maybe I need to write the reactions properly.

HCl is a strong acid and will dissociate completely: HCl → H+ + Cl^-.

H2SO4 is a strong acid, but it's diprotic, so H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and dissociates into Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-.

So the neutralization would be between H+ and OH^-.

The total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So yes, 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react.

So the total enthalpy change is 0.2 × 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ. So that's -11.46 kJ, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options:

A) -2.72 kcal → that's about 11.46 kJ, since 1 kcal is ~4.184 kJ. So 2.72 kcal is 2.72 ×4.184 ≈11.42 kJ. So that matches.

Wait, but wait, another point. The problem says "when mixed", but do I need to consider the dilution? Because the volumes are adding up. Oh wait, but the problem is about the enthalpy, which is a function of moles, not concentration. So molarity doesn't matter once the moles are calculated. So I think the dilution doesn't affect the calculation here.

So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.42 kJ. But looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal and option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, hold on. Did I confuse kcal and kJ in the options? Let me recheck the options.

Options:
A) -2.72 kcal
B) -11.42 kcal
C) -3.80 kcal
D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, so the correct answer in kJ is approximately -11.46 kJ. But option B is in kcal, and option D is in kJ but with a different value. So perhaps I made a mistake in converting.

Wait, if the total is 0.2 moles × 57.3 kJ/mol = 11.46 kJ, so the answer should be approximately -11.46 kJ. But none of the options directly state that. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger. Did I miscalculate the moles?

Wait, let me recalculate the moles:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol. Correct.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. Each mole gives 2 H+, so 0.18 mol.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol. Correct.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol. Correct.

So the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of acid-base reaction, regardless of the number of H+ ions. Or wait, maybe because H2SO4 is diprotic, each mole contributes 2 H+ so the enthalpy per mole of H2SO4 is 2 × 57.3 kJ.

Wait, but I think the standard enthalpy is per mole of H+ ion. So in the case of H2SO4, each mole contributes two H+, so each H+ contributes 57.3 kJ. So for 0.18 moles of H+ from H2SO4, it's 0.18 ×57.3 = ~10.314 kJ. Then, for HCl's 0.1 mole H+, it's 5.73 kJ, so total H+ is 0.28, 0.28×57.3=16.044 kJ. But wait, no. Because only 0.2 moles react because OH- is 0.2.

Wait, no. Because the H+ is in excess. So, the neutralization uses up 0.2 moles of H+ and OH-.

So total enthalpy is 0.2 ×57.3 = 11.46 kJ.

But none of the options have that. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal instead of kJ.

So 11.46 kJ is equal to 11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.738 kcal. So approximately -2.74 kcal. Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close.

But then why is option B present? Option B is -11.42 kcal, which would be about 11.42 *4.184 ≈ 47.7 kJ. That's much higher than our calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake in units.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer in kcal, considering that the enthalpy is per mole of H+. Wait, but no, the standard enthalpy is in kJ.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization per mole of acid-base reaction, and not per mole of H+.

Wait, maybe the neutralization is considered per mole of acid and base, but that's not the usual way. Because neutralization is H+ + OH- → H2O.

Hmm, perhaps I should check another approach.

Wait, another point: Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, but when it reacts with H2SO4, which is a strong acid, the reaction is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 can neutralize two moles of H+ from H2SO4, but in this case, the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the equivalents of H+ and OH-.

Equivalents of H+ = sum of (n * valence) for each acid.

HCl: 0.1 mol ×1 = 0.1 eq.

H2SO4: 0.09 mol ×2 = 0.18 eq.

Total H+ eq: 0.28 eq.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol ×2 = 0.2 eq.

So, the OH- is 0.2 eq, H+ is 0.28 eq. So the neutralization will proceed until OH- is consumed, which is 0.2 eq. So the total H+ that reacts is 0.2 eq, and OH- is 0.2 eq.

So, the enthalpy change is 0.2 eq × 57.3 kJ/eq → 11.46 kJ.

So the answer in kJ is approximately -11.46 kJ. But none of the options have that. Looking back, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the molarity calculations.

Wait, 500 mL is 0.5 L, 300 mL is 0.3 L, 200 mL is 0.2 L. So that's correct.

HCl: 0.2 *0.5 = 0.1. Correct.

H2SO4: 0.3 *0.3= 0.09. Correct.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 *0.2 =0.1. Correct.

Wait, so the calculation seems correct. So why the discrepancy in the options?

Alternatively, perhaps the given problem has a typo or the options are in different units. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which would be if 0.28 moles reacted, which is not possible because OH- is only 0.2 moles.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the total possible neutralization, not considering the limiting reagent. But that doesn't make sense because the reaction would stop when one reagent is used up.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the enthalpy of neutralization is (n1 - n2) × ΔH, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering all the H+ from HCl and H2SO4 as contributing to the neutralization, but that would ignore the limiting reagent. But that can't be right because the OH- is the limiting.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for ΔH. Maybe it's -57.3 kcal/mol. Wait, no, that's way too big. 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So 57.3 kJ is about 13.66 kcal.

Wait, if ΔH is -57.3 kJ/mol, which is approximately -13.66 kcal/mol. So for 0.2 moles, that's 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ, which is about -2.74 kcal. So the answer would be approximately -2.72 kcal (option A). So why is there an option D that is -16.0 kJ? That would be 0.28 * (-57.3) = -16.044 kJ, which is option D. But that would be if all 0.28 moles of H+ reacted, which is not possible because OH- is only 0.2 moles.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A (-2.72 kcal) when considering the reaction is limited by OH-.

But wait, the problem statement says 'when mixed'—so perhaps the total H+ and OH- are neutralized as much as possible, which is 0.2 moles. So the answer would be -2.72 kcal (option A) if converted correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ, but I'm miscalculating. Let me re-calculate:

0.2 moles ×57.3 kJ/mol = 11.46 kJ. So the answer in kJ would be approximately -11.46 kJ, but none of the options match that. The closest is option B, which is in kcal: 11.42 kcal. Which would be 11.42 kcal, which is about 11.42 *4.184 ≈47.7 kJ. No, that's way higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation of moles. Let me check again.

Wait, another thing: the problem asks for the enthalpy of neutralization. Neutralization usually refers to the reaction of one mole of acid with one mole of base, but considering their H+ and OH- contributions.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the neutralization as the mixing of all the solutions, leading to a total reaction. Let's write the overall reaction.

The H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4.

HCl → H+ + Cl^-.

H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-.

So the reaction would be:

H+ (from HCl and H2SO4) + OH^- (from Ba(OH)2) → H2O.

So the total H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles.

So the reaction would produce 0.2 moles of H2O, releasing 0.2 ×57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ.

So the enthalpy is -11.46 kJ. But none of the options match. Oh wait, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is close to 0.28 ×57.3, which is about 16.044 kJ.

Wait, but that would imply that all H+ reacted, which isn't possible. So perhaps the problem expects the calculation without considering the limiting reagent, which would be incorrect, but perhaps that's what the options are expecting.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the student to ignore the limiting reagent and calculate based on the available H+ and OH-. But that would be wrong because the reaction stops when one reagent is exhausted.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the neutralization enthalpy. Maybe the neutralization of 1 mole of H+ releases 57.3 kJ, so 0.28 moles would release 16.044 kJ, which is about 16.0 kJ. That would be option D.

But why would that be the case? Because the H+ comes from two different acids, perhaps the problem expects you to consider all of them. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and take the minimum.

H+ total: 0.28.

OH-: 0.2.

So the reaction produces 0.2 moles of H2O, releasing 0.2 ×57.3 = 11.46 kJ.

So the correct answer is about -11.46 kJ, but the options don't have that. But option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately 11.42 kcal, which is about 47.74 kJ. Which is much higher. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is that I didn't consider the dilution effect on the enthalpy. But the enthalpy change is a function of moles, not concentration. So it shouldn't matter.

Wait, another thought: the problem says 'enthalpy of neutralization' which is per mole of reaction as written. So, the formula is:

q = n × ΔH.

But the units in options vary. So perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal.

Wait, 11.46 kJ is 11.46 /4.184 ≈2.738 kcal. So approximately -2.74 kcal. Option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

But why is option B present? Because 11.42 kcal would be about 47.7 kJ, which would be if 0.83 moles reacted, which is not the case here. So I think the correct answer must be option A.

Wait, but the problem says 'calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when the solutions are mixed.' So the moles are correct as 0.2.

So the enthalpy is approximately -11.46 kJ, which is about -2.74 kcal. So the closest option is A: -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but the problem gives some options in kJ and others in kcal. So perhaps the correct answer is option B if the units are kJ, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the neutralization considers each acid and base separately.

Wait, for HCl and Ba(OH)2:

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

But since HCl is monoprotic and Ba(OH)2 is diprotic, the reaction would be:

2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

So for each mole of Ba(OH)2, 2 moles of HCl are needed.

But wait, in our case, we have 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2 and 0.1 moles of HCl. So, the reaction would require 2 moles of HCl per mole of Ba(OH)2. So 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2 would need 0.2 moles of HCl. But we only have 0.1 moles of HCl. So HCl is the limiting reagent here.

So the HCl would neutralize 0.05 moles of Ba(OH)2 (since each HCl provides one H+, and Ba(OH)2 needs two H+ per mole).

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach it as separate neutralizations.

But perhaps it's better to treat all H+ and OH- together.

In any case, I think the correct approach is to sum all H+ and OH- and find the limiting reagent, which gives 0.2 moles reacting. So the enthalpy is 0.2 *57.3 kJ =11.46 kJ, which is approximately 2.74 kcal. So the closest option is A: -2.72 kcal.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to consider all H+ and OH- without considering limiting reagents, which would give 0.28 +0.2 =0.48, but that's not correct.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

Option D is -16.0 kJ. That's about 0.28 ×57.3 kJ=16.044 kJ. So if the problem ignores the limiting reagent, uses all H+ (0.28 moles), then the answer would be -16.0 kJ, option D. But that's incorrect because OH- is the limiting reagent.

But perhaps the problem is designed that way, expecting students to consider all H+ without checking for limiting reagent. In that case, the answer would be D.

But the correct approach should consider the limiting reagent, leading to answer A.

But since some options are in kJ and others in kcal, perhaps I should convert 11.46 kJ to kcal:

11.46 kJ /4.184 kJ/kcal ≈2.738 kcal → approximately -2.74 kcal, which is option A: -2.72 kcal.

So I think the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when the given solutions are mixed, we first determine the moles of \( \text{H}^+ \) from the acids and the moles of \( \text{OH}^- \) from the base:

1. **HCl (500 mL, 0.2 M):**  
   Moles of \( \text{H}^+ \) = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **H\(_2\)SO\(_4\) (300 mL, 0.3 M):**  
   Moles of \( \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 \) = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Since \( \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 \) is diprotic, it contributes \( 2 \times 0.09 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \).

3. **Ba(OH)\(_2\) (200 mL, 0.5 M):**  
   Moles of \( \text{Ba(OH)}_2 \) = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of \( \text{Ba(OH)}_2 \) dissociates into 2 moles of \( \text{OH}^- \), so moles of \( \text{OH}^- \) = \( 2 \times 0.1 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \to \text{H}_2\text{O} \), which occurs in a 1:1 molar ratio. The limiting reagent is \( \text{OH}^- \), as it has fewer moles (\( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \)) compared to \( \text{H}^+ \) (\( 0.28 \, \text{mol} \)).

Thus, \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \) and \( \text{OH}^- \) react to form \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}_2\text{O} \). The enthalpy change for neutralization is approximately \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) (or \( -13.66 \, \text{kcal/mol} \)).

- **Total enthalpy change in kJ:**  
  \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} = -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \).

- **Total enthalpy change in kcal:**  
  \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \div 4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal} \approx -2.74 \, \text{kcal} \).

Now, comparing with the options:

- **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Closest to the calculated value of \( -2.74 \, \text{kcal} \).  
- **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** Incorrect, as it corresponds to a much larger enthalpy change.  
- **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculation.  
- **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** Incorrect, as it assumes all \( 0.28 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \) reacts, which is not possible due to the limiting reagent \( \text{OH}^- \).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**, as it aligns with the calculation when converted to kcal.

Answer: A
