Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because eigenvectors and eigenvalues can be a little tricky. Let me read through the question carefully and try to break it down.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the operator for spin (like for a muon, which is a lepton with spin-1/2) is given by the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So I think the operator here is the spin operator.

Wait, the operator P is given with its X, Y, Z components. Let me write them down as given:

- P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. Oh right, that's the Pauli σ_x matrix.
- P_y is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the σ_y matrix.
- P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], so that's σ_z.

So the operator P is the spin operator, and the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. The eigenvector corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Spin-up in the direction n would give this eigenvalue.

Wait, the direction is arbitrary, but the eigenvector would depend on the direction. Hmm, but the problem gives the components, so I might need to find the eigenvector in the direction n, which lies in the x-z plane.

Wait, no. Wait, the operator P is given as these components, but the direction of measurement is along an arbitrary direction n in x-z plane. Oh, so the operator along n would be P · n. Because the operator for spin in direction n is the dot product of the Pauli matrices with the unit vector n.

Right, so the operator for spin in direction n is P·n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So n = (n_x, 0, n_z), and since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So the operator P·n becomes (n_x P_x + n_z P_z). Since P_x is (ħ/2) σ_x and P_z is (ħ/2) σ_z, the operator becomes (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

The eigenvalue equation is (P·n)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>, because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Wait, no. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so the equation is (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

So, substituting P·n:

(ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Dividing both sides by ħ/2 gives:

(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z)|ψ> = |ψ>.

So the matrix for the operator is n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z. Let's write that matrix.

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So multiplying by n_x and n_z respectively:

n_x σ_x = [[0, n_x],[n_x, 0]]
n_z σ_z = [[n_z, 0],[0, -n_z]]

Adding these together:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

So the matrix is:
[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

We are looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +1 because when we set the equation (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z)|ψ> = |ψ>, the eigenvalue is 1 (since (ħ/2) * 1 = eigenvalue given). So the eigenvalue equation is (matrix - I) |ψ> = 0.

So, the matrix minus identity is:

[ [n_z - 1, n_x], 
  [n_x, -n_z -1] ]

Wait, wait, no. Let me correct that. The equation is (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z - I)|ψ> = 0.

So the matrix is:

[[n_z - 1, n_x],
 [n_x, -n_z - 1]]

The eigenvector must satisfy this equation. Let me write the system of equations for the components of |ψ> = [a, b]^T.

Equation 1: (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
Equation 2: n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

We can write these as:

(n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
n_x a + (-n_z - 1) b = 0

Hmm, to find non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero. But since we're already looking for the eigenvalue, the determinant is zero, so we can proceed.

Let me try to solve the equations.

From equation 1: a = [ -n_x b ] / (n_z - 1 )

Wait, but let's see, perhaps we can find a relation between a and b.

From equation 1:

a = [ -n_x / (n_z - 1) ] * b

Let me substitute this into equation 2.

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Substituting a:

n_x [ (-n_x)/(n_z -1) b ] + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Simplify:

[ (-n_x^2 ) / (n_z -1) + (-n_z -1) ] b = 0

Factor out b:

[ (-n_x^2 - (n_z +1)(n_z -1) ) ] / (n_z -1) ) * b = 0

Wait, wait, let's compute the numerator:

- n_x^2 - (n_z +1)(n_z -1) = -n_x^2 - (n_z^2 -1) ) = -n_x^2 -n_z^2 +1

But since n_x^2 +n_z^2 = 1 (because n is a unit vector in x-z plane),

So - (n_x^2 +n_z^2) +1 = -(1) +1 = 0.

So the numerator is zero. So the equation holds, which makes sense because it's an eigenvalue equation.

So, going back, a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b

But I need to express the eigenvector in terms of n. Let me think about how to write a and b.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to parameterize the direction n. Since n is in x-z plane, I can write n_x = cosθ and n_z = sinθ, but wait, wait. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the direction can be represented with polar angle θ (from z-axis) and azimuthal angle φ. But since it's in x-z plane, the angle φ is zero. So n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ, because in x-z plane, the angle from z-axis is θ, so x-component is cosθ, z is sinθ.

Wait no, wait: the standard spherical coordinates have polar angle θ from the positive z-axis. So for a direction in x-z plane, the unit vector is (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) if φ is 0 or π/2? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the unit vector n in the x-z plane would have components (n_x, 0, n_z), where n_x² + n_z² = 1. So we can write n_x = cosθ and n_z = sinθ, where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Because when θ=0, we're along +z, and θ=π/2, along +x.

Wait, no, because if θ is the angle from the z-axis, then in x-z plane, x-component is cosθ, and z-component is sinθ. So n = (cosθ, 0, sinθ). Because when θ =0, n is along +z, and θ=π/2, it's along +x.

So substituting that, n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ.

Wait, but in the previous problem, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so θ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

So substituting into a and b.

From equation 1:

a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b = [ - cosθ / (sinθ - 1) ] b

Let me express a in terms of b.

So the eigenvector components are proportional to [a, b] = [ (-cosθ)/(sinθ-1) * b, b ]

We can factor out b, and write the eigenvector as:

[ (-cosθ)/(sinθ - 1), 1 ]

Wait, but perhaps it's better to write this in terms of sin(theta/2) and cos(theta/2), because I remember that the spin-up state in direction theta is often expressed with those terms.

Alternatively, maybe we can factor this expression differently.

Let me compute a.

a = [ -cosθ ] / ( sinθ - 1 ) = [ cosθ ] / ( 1 - sinθ )

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + sinθ):

a = cosθ (1 + sinθ) / [ (1 - sinθ)(1 + sinθ) ) ] = cosθ (1 + sinθ) / (1 - sin²θ) )

But 1 - sin²θ = cos²θ, so denominator is cos²θ.

So a = [ cosθ (1 + sinθ) ) ] / cos²θ ) = (1 + sinθ) / cosθ.

So a = (1 + sinθ)/cosθ.

So the eigenvector components are [ a, 1 ] = [ (1 + sinθ)/cosθ , 1 ]

Wait, but that seems a bit messy. Let me think about another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write the eigenvector as a linear combination of the eigenstates of σ_x and σ_z.

Wait, another approach: the eigenstates for spin-up along direction (θ, φ) are generally given by:

|+> = cos(θ/2)|↑> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|↓>

But in this problem, since n is in x-z plane, φ is 0 (since it's in x-z, so the direction is along (x and z), so φ is 0 or π? Wait, in spherical coordinates, φ is the azimuthal angle. If the direction is in x-z plane, φ is 0 or π, but for spin-up, I think it would just be 0. So the state would be:

cos(θ/2)|↑> + sin(θ/2)|↓>

Wait, but let me think: for a direction making an angle θ with the z-axis, the eigenstate is |ψ> = [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ]^T. Since the direction is in x-z plane, φ is 0, so it's [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think. When the direction is along +z, θ=0, so the state is [ cos(0), sin(0) ] = [1, 0], which is correct. When θ=π/2 (along +x), the state is [ cos(π/4), sin(π/4) ] = [√2/2, √2/2], which is (|↑> + |↓>)/√2. That makes sense because σ_x eigenstates are (|↑> + |↓>)/√2 and (|↑> - |↓>)/√2.

Wait, but wait: the eigenstate for spin-up along x is (|↑> + |↓>)/√2, which would correspond to θ=π/2 and φ=0.

So in our case, the eigenvector should be [ cosθ/2, sinθ/2 ].

But wait, in our earlier calculation, we arrived at a = (1 + sinθ)/cosθ. Let me check if that's the same as cosθ/2 and sinθ/2.

Wait, let's compute a and b from the spin-up state.

If |ψ> is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ], then let's check if it satisfies the eigenvalue equation.

The matrix is:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

Substituting n_x=cosθ, n_z=sinθ.

So matrix becomes:

[ [sinθ, cosθ],
  [cosθ, -sinθ] ]

Multiply this by |ψ>:

First component: sinθ * cos(θ/2) + cosθ * sin(θ/2)
= sinθ cos(θ/2) + cosθ sin(θ/2)
= sin(θ + θ/2) ? Wait, let me compute:

Wait, sin(A + B) = sinA cosB + cosA sinB. But here, A is θ, B is θ/2.

So sin(θ) cos(θ/2) + cos(θ) sin(θ/2) = sin( (3θ/2) ) ?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me compute:

Wait, sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)
cosθ = cos²(θ/2) - sin²(θ/2)
Hmm, maybe another approach.

Let me compute the product for the first component:

sinθ cos(θ/2) + cosθ sin(θ/2) 

= 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) * cos(θ/2) + (cos²(θ/2) - sin²(θ/2)) ) * sin(θ/2)

= 2 sin(θ/2) cos²(θ/2) + cos²(θ/2) sin(θ/2) - sin^3(θ/2)

= [2 cos²(θ/2) + cos²(θ/2) - sin²(θ/2)] sin(θ/2)

Wait, perhaps it's easier to factor:

= sin(θ) cos(θ/2) + cos(θ) sin(θ/2)

= [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] cos(θ/2) + [ cos²(θ/2) - sin²(theta/2) ] sin(theta/2)

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me compute for specific θ, say θ=0.

If θ=0: sinθ=0, cosθ=1. The matrix becomes [[0,1],[1,0]]. The state is [1,0]. The product is [0*1 +1*0, 1*1 +0*0] = [0,1]. That's not equal to the original state. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps the state [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] isn't correct. Wait, because when theta=0, the state is [1,0], but when you apply the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], which swaps the components, you get [0,1], which is not the same as [1,0]. So that state isn't an eigenstate for theta=0. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, but when theta=0, the operator is [[0,1],[1,0]], which is sigma_x, so the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. The eigenstates are (|↑> + |↓>)/sqrt(2) for +1 and (|↑> - |↓>)/sqrt(2) for -1.

So for theta=0, the eigenvalue is +1, so the state should be [1,0], because the eigenstate of sigma_z is |↑> which is [1,0], but wait that's only for sigma_z. So I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Let me go back.

The operator P·n = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). The eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so the equation is (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z)|ψ> = |ψ>.

The matrix of the operator is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

We can write this as:

[ n_z   n_x ]
[ n_x  -n_z ]

We can denote this as M. So M |ψ> = |ψ>.

So M - I = 

[ n_z - 1, n_x ]
[ n_x, -n_z -1 ]

The determinant of (M - I) must be zero for non-trivial solutions. Let me compute the determinant:

Determinant = (n_z - 1)(-n_z -1) - (n_x)^2 

= -(n_z^2 - 1) -n_x^2 

= -n_z^2 +1 -n_x^2 

= 1 - (n_x^2 +n_z^2) 

But since n_x^2 +n_z^2 =1,

Determinant = 1 -1 =0. So yes, eigenvalue is correct.

So the eigenvectors are non-trivial solutions to (M - I)|ψ> =0.

Let me take the first row: (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0 → a = [ -n_x b ] / (n_z -1 )

But I can parameterize the eigenvector as [a, b]^T = b [ -n_x/(n_z -1 ), 1 ]

Hmm, perhaps it's better to write in terms of an angle. Let me let θ be the angle between n and the z-axis. So n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ.

So substituting:

a = [ - cosθ * b ] / ( sinθ -1 )

So a = [ cosθ / (1 - sinθ) ) ] * b

Wait, let me compute a in terms of b.

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + sinθ):

a = [ cosθ (1 + sinθ) ] / [ (1 - sinθ)(1 + sinθ) ) ] * b

Denominator is 1 - sin²θ = cos²θ.

So a = [ cosθ (1 + sinθ) ] / cos²θ * b → a = (1 + sinθ)/cosθ * b.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ (1 + sinθ)/cosθ , 1 ]

But let me write this as [ (1 + sinθ), cosθ ] / cosθ.

Wait, because if I factor out 1/cosθ, it would be [ (1+sinθ), cosθ ]

Wait, no, because [ (1 + sinθ)/cosθ, 1 ] is the same as [ (1 + sinθ), cosθ ] multiplied by 1/cosθ.

So the components are [ (1 + sinθ), cosθ ].

Alternatively, I can factor this as:

[1 + sinθ, cosθ ].

But wait, let me check if this vector is normalized. The norm squared is (1 + sinθ)^2 + cos²θ = 1 + 2 sinθ + sin²θ + cos²θ = 2 + 2 sinθ.

So to normalize, we need to divide by sqrt(2 + 2 sinθ) ) = sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)) ) = sqrt(2) sqrt(1 + sinθ) ).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ (1 + sinθ), cosθ ] / sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)) )

= [ (1 + sinθ) / sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)), cosθ / sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)) ) ]

Simplify:

= [ sqrt( (1 + sinθ) / (2) ), cosθ / sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)) ) ]

Wait, but cosθ / sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)) ) can be simplified using trigonometric identities.

Recall that 1 - sin²θ = cos²θ → cosθ = sqrt(1 - sin²θ), but perhaps another approach is better.

Wait, let me compute (1 + sinθ)/2 and (1 - sinθ)/2.

We know that (1 + sinθ) = [2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4)]^2? Not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps using the identity:

(1 + sinθ) = 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4)^2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express the terms in terms of theta/2.

Let me use the double-angle formula:

1 + sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4)^2 ?

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me try another approach.

Express 1 + sinθ as:

1 + sinθ = 2 ( (1/2) + (sinθ)/2 ) 

But perhaps a better approach is to write 1 + sinθ in terms of cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

Using the identity:

1 + sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4)^2 ?

Alternatively, let's compute (1 + sinθ) using the double-angle formula:

1 + sinθ = sin(theta/2 + pi/4) * 2 cos(theta/2 - pi/4).

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, I recall that:

sin(A + B) = sinA cosB + cosA sinB.

But perhaps the square of cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) could be related.

Wait, (cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2))^2 = cos²(theta/2) + 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) = 1 + sin theta.

Ah, that's right! Because 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) = sin theta.

So, (cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2))^2 = 1 + sin theta.

Which means sqrt(1 + sin theta) = cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2), but only if cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2) are both positive, which is true for theta between 0 and pi.

So, sqrt(1 + sin theta) = cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2).

So, sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ) = [ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ] / sqrt(2).

And cos(theta) can be written as cos^2(theta/2) - sin^2(theta/2) = [cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)][cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)].

So, cos theta = [cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)][cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)].

So, putting this together, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin theta)/2 ) ]

Wait, because:

The first component is (1 + sin theta)/sqrt(2(1 + sin theta)) ) = sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 )

The second component is cos theta / sqrt(2 (1 + sin theta)) )

But cos theta = [cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)][cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)].

So, cos theta / sqrt(2 (1+sin theta)) ) = [ (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2))(cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)) ) ] / [ sqrt(2) (cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)) (cos(theta/2)+ sin(theta/2)) ) ] / [ sqrt(2) (cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)) ) ]

The (cos(theta/2)+ sin(theta/2)) terms cancel, leaving:

= (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)) ) / sqrt(2)

So the components are:

[ sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ) , (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2))/sqrt(2) ]

But (1 + sin theta)/2 = [cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)]^2 / 2.

So sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ) = [cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)] / sqrt(2)

So the eigenvector is:

[ [cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)] / sqrt(2), [cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)] / sqrt(2) ]

= 1/sqrt(2) [ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ]

We can factor this:

= [ cos(theta/2) (1/sqrt(2)), sin(theta/2) (1/sqrt(2)) ) ] + [ sin(theta/2) (1/sqrt(2)), - sin(theta/2) (1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me express it as:

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ cos(theta/2) (1), sin(theta/2) (1) ) ] + (1/sqrt(2)) [ cos(theta/2) (1), - sin(theta/2) (1) ) ]

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps we can write this as a combination of |↑> and |↓> states.

But perhaps it's easier to think of the eigenvector in terms of theta/2.

Wait, the normalized eigenvector can be written as:

[ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]

But since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi=0, so it's [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, but that would imply that the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), but earlier we got something different. Let me check.

Wait, according to the standard spin-1/2 eigenstates, the state along a direction (theta, phi) is:

|+> = cos(theta/2) |↑> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |↓>

In our case, since the direction is in x-z plane, phi=0, so it becomes:

cos(theta/2) |↑> + sin(theta/2) |↓>

Which in vector form is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Hmm, but earlier, when I tried substituting theta=0, this gives [1,0], which is an eigenstate of sigma_z with eigenvalue +1. And indeed, when n is along z, the operator P·n is (ħ/2) sigma_z, so the eigenstate is [1,0], which matches.

But earlier, when I thought of theta=pi/2, the state becomes [0,1], which is the eigenstate of sigma_x with eigenvalue -1. Wait, but wait, no. Because when n is along x, the eigenstate should be (|↑> + |↓>)/sqrt(2), which would correspond to theta=pi/2. So [0,1] isn't the correct eigenstate. So perhaps there's a mistake in my earlier approach.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that when I take the eigenvector [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], I'm assuming that the direction is measured differently.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the polar angle in the standard spherical coordinates with the angle in the x-z plane. Let me think again.

Wait, the standard spherical coordinate system has theta as the polar angle from the positive z-axis, and phi as the azimuthal angle from the x-axis in the xy-plane. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is 0 or pi.

So when the direction is along +x, theta is pi/2, phi is 0. So the state would be |+x> = (|↑> + |↓>)/sqrt(2) = [1, 1]/sqrt(2).

So, according to the standard formula, the state would be [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

At theta=pi/2, phi=0, it becomes [ cos(pi/4), sin(pi/4) ] = [√2/2, √2/2], which is correct.

But earlier, when I computed the eigenvector, I got a different expression. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier algebra.

Let me try to compute the eigenvector again.

The equation is (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = |ψ>

Expressed as:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] [a, b]^T = [a, b]^T

So, the equations are:

n_z a + n_x b = a → a (n_z - 1) + n_x b =0

n_x a - n_z b = b → n_x a - (n_z + 1) b =0

From first equation: a (n_z -1 ) = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b

Substituting into second equation:

n_x * [ -n_x/(n_z -1) b ] - (n_z +1) b =0

=> [ -n_x^2 / (n_z -1) ) - (n_z +1) ] b =0

Multiply through by (n_z -1):

- n_x^2 - (n_z +1)(n_z -1 ) =0

Which is -n_x^2 - (n_z^2 -1 )=0 → n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1 → which holds because n is a unit vector.

So, the condition is satisfied, and the eigenvector is determined up to a scalar multiple.

So, a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b

Let me express this as:

a = [ n_x / (1 - n_z ) ] b

Because I can write denominator as (n_z -1 ) = -(1 - n_z )

So, a = (n_x / (1 - n_z )) b

So, the components are [ a, b ] = [ n_x / (1 -n_z ), 1 ] * b

We can write this as:

[ n_x, (1 -n_z ) ] * (1/(1 -n_z )) ) * b 

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [n_x, 1 -n_z ]

Wait, that's interesting. So, the eigenvector can be written as [n_x, 1 -n_z ].

But wait, for theta=0, n_x=1, n_z=0. So the vector becomes [1,1], which, when normalized, is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)). That can't be right because for theta=0, the eigenstate should be [1,0].

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, let me compute for theta=0.

n_x = cos(0)=1, n_z = sin(0)=0.

So, a = [n_x / (1 -n_z ) ] b → a = [1/(1-0)] b → a = b.

So the eigenvector is [a, b] = [b, b] → [1,1] when b=1. But when normalized, this would be (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)). But wait, that's the eigenstate for sigma_x, which when n is along x, which is theta=pi/2, not theta=0.

Wait, there's a contradiction here. When theta=0, n is along +z, so the eigenstate should be [1,0], but according to this, it's [1,1], which can't be right. So I must have made a mistake.

Ah, I think I see the mistake. The substitution a = (n_x / (1 -n_z )) * b is correct, but when n is along +z, n_x=0, n_z=1.

Wait, no, when theta=0, n is along +z, so n_x= cos(0)=1? No, wait no. Wait, I think I messed up the definition earlier.

Wait, no! Wait, no, no. The unit vector in x-z plane can be parameterized as (sin theta, 0, cos theta), where theta is the angle from the +x axis towards +z. Or perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me clarify the parameters. Let me define the direction n in the x-z plane as making an angle theta with the +z axis, so that n_x = sin theta, n_z = cos theta.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because when theta=0, n is along +z, so n_x=0, n_z=1.

Alternatively, when theta=pi/2, n is along +x, n_x=1, n_z=0.

So, let me redefine n_x = sin theta, n_z= cos theta.

So, substituting this into a:

a = [n_x / (1 - n_z ) ] b = [ sin theta / ( 1 - cos theta ) ] b

Simplify denominator: 1 - cos theta = 2 sin^2(theta/2 )

Numerator: sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So,

a = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / ( 2 sin^2(theta/2) ) ) ] b = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] b = cot(theta/2) b.

So, a = cot(theta/2) * b.

So the components are a = cot(theta/2) b, and b= b.

So, the eigenvector is:

[ cot(theta/2) b, b ] = b [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]

Factor out b:

= [ (cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)), 1 ].

We can write this as [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] / sin(theta/2 )

Wait, but [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] is the standard eigenstate. Wait, let me compute:

[ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] is the spin-up state along direction theta (from +z). So perhaps the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but earlier when I substituted theta=0, I get [1, 0], which is correct. When theta=pi/2, it's [0,1], which seems incorrect because the eigenstate for +x would be [1,1]/sqrt(2). Hmm, this suggests there's a mistake in the parametrization.

Wait, perhaps I should parameterize the direction differently. Let me define the direction as making an angle phi from +x towards +z. Then, n_x = cos phi, n_z = sin phi.

So, substituting into a:

a = [ cos phi / ( 1 - sin phi ) ] b

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with this parametrization.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the eigenvector is [1, e^{i phi} tan(theta/2) ].

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me look at the answer options to see which one fits.

The options are:

A) (√(2/3) ħ, √(1/3) ħ)
B) (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ)
C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))
D) (√(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), √(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2))

Wait, but the question is about the eigenvector, and the options are giving expressions for the components. The eigenvector must be a 2-component vector.

Looking at option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). That's the standard spin-up state along direction theta, but earlier when theta=pi/2, this would give (0,1), which is the eigenstate of sigma_z with eigenvalue -1/2 ħ, which contradicts the given eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, that can't be. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in parametrization.

Wait, no, because for theta=pi/2, the direction is along +x, so the eigenstate should be (1,1)/sqrt(2), which is [cos(pi/4), sin(pi/4) ] = [√2/2, √2/2], which would correspond to theta/2 = pi/4, but according to option C, the state would be (0,1), which is incorrect. So option C is not correct.

Looking at option B: (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ). But when phi=0, it's (cosθ, sinθ). For theta=pi/2, it's (0,1), which again is incorrect.

Option D has components involving cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), scaled by sqrt(2/3) ħ and sqrt(1/3) ħ.

But from earlier, the normalized eigenvector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But looking at the options, option C is exactly [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but earlier when I thought about the state for theta=pi/2, option C gives (0,1), which is sigma_z's eigenstate for -1, but the eigenvalue here is +ħ/2.

Hmm, perhaps the confusion is about the parametrization of the direction. Let's think again.

When the direction is in the x-z plane, the spin-up state along that direction is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

But for the given problem, phi is zero because it's in the x-z plane, so phi=0.

So the state is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But when the direction is along +x (theta=pi/2), the state is [ cos(pi/4), sin(pi/4) ] = [ √2/2, √2/2 ], which is correct as the eigenstate of sigma_x with eigenvalue +1.

So, why did earlier calculations give a different form? Because perhaps the parametrization was done incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier parametrization of n_x and n_z. Let me re-express n_x and n_z in terms of theta.

If the direction is at angle theta from the +z axis towards +x, then:

n_x = sin(theta)
n_z = cos(theta)

So, when theta=0, we're along +z, n_x=0, n_z=1.

When theta=pi/2, we're along +x, n_x=1, n_z=0.

So, substituting into the eigenvector:

a = [n_x / (1 - n_z ) ] b → a = [ sin theta / (1 - cos theta ) ] b.

Using the identity 1 - cos theta = 2 sin²(theta/2 ), and sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 ), so:

a = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / (2 sin²(theta/2) ) ] b = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] b = cot(theta/2) b.

So the eigenvector is [ a, b ] = [ cot(theta/2) b, b ].

But cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2 ), so the components are:

[ (cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)) b, b ]

So, to normalize, the sum of squares should be 1.

So, (cos(theta/2)^2 + sin(theta/2)^2 ) / sin^2(theta/2 ) ) * |b|^2 = (1)/ sin^2(theta/2 ) ) * |b|^2 =1 → |b|^2 = sin^2(theta/2 )

So, b = sin(theta/2 ), and the eigenvector becomes:

[ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Because:

a = (cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)) * sin(theta/2 ) ) = cos(theta/2 )

b = sin(theta/2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Which matches option C.

So the correct answer should be option C: (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) )

Wait, but wait the options don't have ħ, but the question mentions the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So the eigenvector itself is a dimensionless vector, so the options shouldn't have ħ. Looking at the options again:

A) (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ)
B) (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ)
C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))
D) (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2))

So option C is correct.

Wait, but wait the question states that the operator is P which is spin, so the eigenvector would be a spinor, and the components are just the amplitudes, not multiplied by ħ. So the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the spin operator **P** for a muon along an arbitrary direction **n** in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue \( +\hbar/2 \). The operator **P** is expressed in terms of its components:

- \( P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \) (Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix),
- \( P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix} \) (Pauli \( \sigma_y \) matrix),
- \( P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \) (Pauli \( \sigma_z \) matrix).

Since the direction **n** lies in the x-z plane, it can be parameterized as \( \mathbf{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta) \), where \( \theta \) is the angle between **n** and the +z axis. The operator along **n** is given by \( P \cdot \mathbf{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} (\sin\theta \sigma_x + \cos\theta \sigma_z) \). The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
(P \cdot \mathbf{n}) | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle.
\]

Substituting \( P \cdot \mathbf{n} \), the eigenvalue equation becomes:

\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Dividing through by \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \), the matrix equation simplifies to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

1. \( (\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta \, b = 0 \),
2. \( \sin\theta \, a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0 \).

From the first equation, \( a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b \). Using trigonometric identities (\( 1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2) \) and \( \sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2) \)), this simplifies to:

\[
a = \cot(\theta/2) b.
\]

The eigenvector is therefore proportional to \( [a, b] = [\cot(\theta/2), 1] \). To normalize, divide by \( \sqrt{1 + \cot^2(\theta/2)} = \sqrt{\csc^2(\theta/2)} = |\csc(\theta/2)| \), yielding:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches the standard spin-1/2 eigenstate for spin-up along a direction \( \theta \) from the +z axis in the x-z plane.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: \( (\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar) \): Incorrect, as it does not depend on \( \theta \) and is not normalized correctly.
- **Option B**: \( (\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta) \): Incorrect, as it does not match the eigenstate derived above.
- **Option C**: \( (\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2)) \): Correct, as it matches the normalized eigenvector derived from the eigenvalue equation.
- **Option D**: \( (\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2)) \): Incorrect, as it introduces unnecessary scaling factors.

### Final Answer:
The normalized eigenvector is \( (\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2)) \), corresponding to **Option C**.
