Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product based on the IR and NMR data provided. The options are A to D.

First, I think I should analyze the spectroscopic data to determine what Compound X is. Once I know that, I can figure out what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Let's start with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably indicative of O-H or N-H stretching. But more likely, since it's a 3400-2500 range, maybe it's an alkyne C-H stretch or an O-H. Wait, but usually O-H is around 3200-3600. The broadness might suggest it's an O-H, like in a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, if it's an alkyne, the C-H stretch is about 3300-3000, but that's a medium region. Hmm.

Another IR peak is at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl peak, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks could be aromatic C=C stretches. 1610 is a bit lower than the typical 1600 for benzene, which might suggest substitution or conjugation.

Now looking at the 1H NMR. The peaks are at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). A broad singlet around 10 ppm makes me think of an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10. But wait, carboxylic acids also have protons around 10, but they are usually broad because of hydrogen bonding. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton, like phenolic, but then the coupling would be different. Hmm.

Next, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) are typical of an aromatic ring with two substituents in para positions. The doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene. So maybe it's a substituted benzene ring with two substituents. The downfield shift at 8.0 suggests electron-withdrawing groups, like nitro, carbonyl, or something similar. But wait, the substituents could also be electron-donating, but in this case, the shift is higher so more likely electron-withdrawing.

The other NMR peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). 

Let me piece this together. The 1.4 ppm doublet with 3H suggests a methyl group attached to something that's split into a doublet. Maybe a methylene adjacent to a CH2 or CH group. Wait, a common structure where a methyl is attached to a CH that's next to something is like a tert-butyl group, but that would be more like 1.2 ppm as a triplet for the CH2 groups. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH(CH3)2 group, but wait, the 1.4 is a doublet for 3H, which could be a CH3 attached to a CH2, which is attached to another group.

Let me think about the possible structure. The aromatic ring has substituents in para positions. One substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, perhaps a carbonyl, like a ketone or an ester. Or maybe a nitro group, but that would be more de-shielded. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid group, which would have the O-H in the IR.

Wait, looking at the IR again, the 1720 cm-1 is likely a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad around 2500-3400, which fits the first IR region. But wait, the 1720 might be an ester or a ketone. Let's think: carboxylic acids have O-H broad peaks around 2500-3300, which is the first IR region. The 1720 would be a carbonyl, which for a carboxylic acid would be around 1700, but maybe in this case it's a bit higher. Alternatively, it could be an ester (usually around 1735-1760 cm-1), or a ketone (around 1715 cm-1). So maybe the carbonyl is a ketone.

The NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a bit upfield for a carboxylic acid proton but maybe for another group. Alternatively, if the proton is an aldehyde, but then the IR at 1720 wouldn't fit as aldehydes have lower carbonyl frequencies. Wait, aldehydes are around 1720? No, aldehydes are usually around 1720-1700 cm-1. So maybe an aldehyde.

Wait, let me think of the aldehyde. If there's an aldehyde group, the NMR would have a peak around 9-10 ppm, usually a triplet if adjacent to a CH2, but in this case, it's a broad singlet. But what if it's a benzylic aldehyde, which could be deshielded more, maybe around 10 ppm. Or perhaps it's a phenolic OH, but that's usually more in the 5-7 ppm range, unless it's an aromatic aldehyde.

Wait, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet. Could it be a formyl proton (RCHO)? But then the IR would have a strong peak around 2820 and 2720 cm-1 for the aldehyde C-H stretch, but the IR data only shows a broad region from 3400-2500, which is a very broad area and could include O-H or other types of C-H. Hmm, maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the 1720 cm-1 is a bit high for a carboxylic acid carbonyl. Carboxylic acids are usually around 1700 cm-1. Maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Let's think about the NMR.

The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is typical of a methyl group attached to a CH2. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl attached to a CH group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is a methylene group. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH group adjacent to other groups.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with substituents at para positions. One substituent is a carbonyl group, and the other is an isobutyl group or similar. Let me try to sketch this.

The aromatic ring has a substituent which is a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and another substituent which is a CH2CH(CH2CH3)2 or something like that. Wait, the 0.9 ppm triplet is probably a CH2CH2CH3 group. Let me think: a CH2CH2CH3 group would have the CH2CH3 as a triplet at 0.9 ppm. Then, the adjacent CH2 would split into a triplet as well. Wait, but in the NMR, there's a 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), which could be a CH2 next to a CH. And the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. So putting that together, perhaps the substituent is a propyl chain with a branch.

Wait, that might be a butyl group. Let's think about the substituent attached to the ring. Suppose it's a (CH2CH(CH2CH3)) group, but that's not quite right. Or maybe it's an isobutyl group. Isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. Let me see the NMR data.

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group. So the last CH3 is attached to a CH2 which is next to another CH. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. So perhaps the structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to something else.

Wait, let's think of the substituent as a propyl chain where the middle CH has a methyl branch. So, perhaps it's CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's a sec-butyl group. The substituent on the benzene is a sec-butyl group.

Wait, the substituent's structure would be:

The benzene ring has a substituent which is a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester) and a substituent which is a sec-butyl group.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is a CH2 next to that CH. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is the CH next to the aromatic ring.

So the substituent is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

The substituent could be a propyl chain: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the ring? Or perhaps it's an isobutyl group: CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, because the isobutyl group would have a CH2 attached to a CH(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with a branch. Let me think of the structure.

The substituent would be a group like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that would be a pentyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl group where the middle CH has a methyl branch. So, like CH2-CH(CH3)- attached to the ring.

Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9, which is a CH2CH2CH3. So, perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group attached to a CH, which is attached to the ring.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to draw it out in my mind.

The substituent on the benzene is a group that includes a CH(CH3) connected to a CH2CH3. So, for example, a CH(CH2CH3)CH3 group. Wait, that would be a neopentyl group, but that's more like (CH3)3C-CH2- attached to something.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a tert-butyl group. But the NMR would show a triplet for the CH2 groups of the tert-butyl, but in this case, the 0.9 is a triplet, which is more like a regular ethyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an isobutyl group. Isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. So the structure would be benzene with an isobutyl group and a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which would correspond to the CH2CH3 group in the isobutyl. Then, the adjacent CH2 would be a quartet, but in the data, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H, which might be a CH2 connected to a CH. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would be the CH3 attached to the CH. So, putting it together:

The substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)2 group attached to the ring. So, the benzene ring has at the para positions a carbonyl group and a isobutyl group.

Wait, but the carbonyl group could be a ketone (C=O) or an ester or a carboxylic acid. Let me look back at the IR. The 1720 cm-1 would be ester or ketone. If it's a ketone, the NMR would have a peak around 2.1 ppm for the carbonyl adjacent CH3, but I don't see such a peak. Hmm.

Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be around 10.5 ppm, which fits the 10.5 ppm peak. So the structure would be a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and an isobutyl group. But wait, the 1.4 ppm d (3H) would be a methyl group attached to a CH, which is attached to another group.

Wait, another point: the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is more in line with an ester than a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have lower frequencies, around 1700 cm-1. So perhaps it's an ester or a ketone.

But wait, the 10.5 ppm peak is a singlet, so maybe it's a carbonyl group adjacent to something else. Alternatively, could it be a benzaldehyde group, which would have a peak around 9-10 ppm for the aldehyde proton. But then the carbonyl would be around 1720, which fits.

So, perhaps the structure is para-substituted benzaldehyde with an isobutyl group.

Wait, but in that case, the substituents would be a formyl group (CHO) and an isobutyl group. Let me see if that fits the NMR.

The 10.5 ppm peak would be the aldehyde proton; however, aldehydes are usually deshielded and appear as a singlet around 9.5-10 ppm. But wait, the aldehyde proton is a triplet because it's attached to a CH2, but in this case, the substituent is directly attached to the ring. So the aldehyde would be a singlet. But the 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet. Hmm, maybe it's a different group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propanoic acid group. Let me think: if the benzene ring has a propanoic acid group and an isobutyl group, that could fit.

Wait, the NMR shows a 10.5 ppm peak, which would be the carboxylic acid proton. But carboxylic acids usually are broad, which fits the 'bs' (broad singlet) description.

But then, the IR would show the O-H stretch in the 3400-2500 region, which it does. And the 1720 would be the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid. So that seems to fit.

So the structure is a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions: a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an isobutyl group (-CH2CH(CH3)2).

Wait, but the isobutyl group would have a CH2CH(CH3)2 structure, right? So the substituent would be a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group attached to the ring.

Now, let's map the NMR data.

The 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) is the carboxylic acid proton.

The aromatic protons: two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. So the substituents are in para positions. The more deshielded protons (8.0 ppm) would be the ones ortho to the electron-withdrawing group (the -COOH), and the less deshielded (7.2 ppm) would be ortho to the isobutyl group, which is an electron-donating group.

Now, the isobutyl group would contribute the following NMR peaks: the CH2 groups and the CH3 groups.

The isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. The CH2 next to the ring is CH2-, then CH(CH3)2.

Wait, no, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, the structure is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, no, I think it's (CH2)2CHCH3? Wait, no. Wait, isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, no, the isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no. Let me clarify: the isobutyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2, but that's not correct. Wait, isobutyl is (CH2)2CHCH3? No, no. Wait, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3) ?

No, wait, butane is CH3CH2CH2CH3. Isobutyl is (CH3)2CHCH2-. Wait, no. Wait, isobutyl is (CH2)2CHCH3? No, that would be pentyl. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The isobutyl group is a four-carbon substituent where the point of attachment is at the second carbon. So it's CH2CH(CH3)2. So the structure would be:

Ring-CH2-CH(CH3)2.

Wait, no, that's not right because that would be a substituent with three carbons. Wait, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, that would have four carbons. Wait, maybe I should count again.

Butyl is four carbons: -CH2CH2CH2CH3 is n-butyl. Isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3), but wait, that would be five carbons. No, maybe I'm mixing up.

Wait, no. Isobutyl is (CH2)CH(CH3)2. So for isobutyl group:

The structure is -CH2-CH(CH3)2. So the substituent on the benzene is a CH2 connected to a CH which is connected to two CH3 groups.

So, the substituent would be:

Ring-CH2-CH(CH3)2.

Wait, but that would have the structure: CH2-CH(CH3)2. So the CH2 is attached to the ring, then a CH which is attached to two methyl groups.

So in terms of the NMR, the CH2 group (attached to the ring) would be split into a triplet because it's next to the CH group which has two neighboring CH3 groups. Wait, but in the NMR, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H, which could be the CH2 group. Then, the 2.9 ppm m (1H) would be the CH group. The 1.4 ppm d (3H) would be each of the methyl groups on the CH. Wait, but the methyl groups on the CH would each be a triplet? Or perhaps a singlet? No, since they're attached to the same CH, perhaps as a multiplet.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline each part:

- 10.5 ppm (1H, bs): probably the carboxylic acid proton.
- Aromatic protons: two doublets, integration 2H each. So the ring has two substituents para to each other.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): likely a CH group attached to other groups.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): likely a CH2 group.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 group attached to a CH.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a CH2CH3 group.

Wait, so the CH2CH3 would come from a propyl chain. But in an isobutyl group, the end would be CH2CH3 attached to a CH which is attached to another CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group: CH2CH2CH3 attached to the ring. But then, how does that fit the NMR?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a tert-butyl group. But the tert-butyl group would have three equivalent CH3 groups attached to a central CH. So the NMR would show a triplet for the CH2 groups, but in this case, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, that's wrong. Sec-butyl is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). No, that's not right. Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is: CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. No, wait. No, the correct structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, perhaps I should think of it as CH2CH(CH3)2. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group with a methyl branch. So the substituent is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. But that would be a pentyl group, I think.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, and the NMR shows the various CH2 and CH3 groups.

Wait, another approach. Let's look at the options to see what they are and see if they match the data.

Options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at position 4 (para) and a sec-butyl group at position 4? No, wait, the numbering would be such that the substituents are at 1 and 4 positions, perhaps. Or maybe the substituents are at 4 and another position.

Wait, for option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So benzoic acid (COOH) at position 1, and a sec-butyl group at position 4? Or wait, the substituents would be at positions 1 and 4.

Wait, in benzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1. Then, the substituent would be at position 4, which is para to it. So the substituent is at 4.

So the structure would be a benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. No, wait, the sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, that's not correct. Wait, the correct structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- as a substituent? No, no. Wait, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-? No, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, the 'sec-butyl' group is a butyl group where the point of attachment is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. No, that doesn't seem right. 

Wait, the butyl group has four carbons. The structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the ring. No, that's not correct because that would be a pentyl group. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as:

The butyl group is:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3
- iso-butyl: (CH3)2CHCH2-
- sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3) ?

Wait, no, the correct structure for sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. So the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the ring.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on this, but let's proceed.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzoic acid is at position 1, and the sec-butyl is at position 4.

In this case, the substituents are a COOH group and a sec-butyl group on the benzene ring.

Now, looking at the NMR data provided, does this match?

The 1H NMR would show:

- Aromatic protons: two doublets (2H each) at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. These would be the protons para to the substituents.

Benzoic acid would have a COOH group, giving the 10.5 ppm peak.

The substituent (sec-butyl) would have:

- The CH2 groups and CH3 groups. Let's see:

The sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

So the structure is:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-?

Wait, no, that would be a pentyl group. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the structure of sec-butyl.

The butyl group is four carbons. The 'sec' refers to the position of substitution. So the substituent is attached to the second carbon of a four-carbon chain. So the structure is:

-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- ?

Wait, that can't be right because that's five carbons. Alternatively, the correct structure is:

-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- ?

No, that's a four-carbon chain with the substituent on the second carbon. So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the ring.

But wait, that's a four-carbon substituent, so the substituent would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- ?

Wait, that's a pentyl group, which doesn't make sense. I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me instead consider the NMR data.

The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a CH2CH3 group. That would be the end of a propyl chain. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) is a CH2 next to a CH. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is a CH.

So putting this together, the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group? No, perhaps it's a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2 group. Wait, but the 0.9 ppm triplet suggests a CH2CH3 group at the end. So the substituent would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

That's a pentyl group with a branch. Wait, no, that's an isoamyl group.

Wait, isoamyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. So the substituent would be isoamyl attached to the ring.

But wait, the substituent is on the benzene ring. So for isoamyl group, the structure would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

But now, the NMR would show peaks for each CH2 and CH3 in that substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch at the middle. So it's CH2-CH(CH3)-.

Wait, but then the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-.

But that would give a methyl group attached to a CH, which is attached to a CH2 attached to the ring.

In this case, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 next to the ring (Ph-CH2-) as a quartet (if next to a CH group), but in the data, it's a multiplet at 1.7 ppm.

- The CH(CH3) would have the 2.9 ppm m (1H) and the 1.4 ppm d (3H) for the methyl attached to it.

- The CH2CH3 at the end would be a triplet at 0.9 ppm.

So the substituent would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Hmm, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, the substituent is a propyl group (CH2CH2CH3) attached to the ring through a CH group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3, which is an isoamyl group.

In that case, the substituent would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So, the NMR would show:

- The terminal CH2CH3 as a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H).
- The adjacent CH2 group (from CH2-CH(CH3)-) as a quartet, but in the data, it's a multiplet at 1.7 ppm.
- The CH(CH3) would have a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) and the methyl group attached to it as a doublet at 1.4 ppm (d,3H).

So that seems to fit. So the substituent is an isoamyl group.

Wait, but isoamyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. So the substituent would be isoamyl attached to the ring.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituents are a COOH and a sec-butyl group. But in this case, the substituent is an isoamyl group, which might not be one of the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group. Let me think: if the substituent is a propyl group, then the NMR would have:

- The terminal CH2CH3 as triplet at 0.9 ppm.
- The adjacent CH2 as a quartet at around 1.7 ppm.
- The CH next to the ring as a triplet at around 2.9 ppm.

But in the data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (not a triplet), and the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet (not a quartet). So that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps it's a butyl group. Let me think: if the substituent is a butyl group, the NMR would show triplet, quartet, etc. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane or something else, but that's probably not the case.

Another angle: the IR shows a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are indicative of aromatic C=C stretching. The 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl, and the 3400-2500 is O-H.

So, putting it all together, Compound X is likely a benzoic acid derivative. The substituents on the ring are a COOH group and an isobutyl group.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at position 4.

So if that's the case, then the substituent would be a sec-butyl group attached to the ring.

The structure of sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the ring.

Wait, but that would have a CH2 group attached to the ring, followed by a CH(CH3), followed by another CH2. So the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

But wait, that's a four-carbon chain? No, it's three carbons: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-, but I'm not sure.

In any case, the NMR data would have the CH2 groups and the CH3 groups. So the 0.9 ppm triplet comes from the terminal CH2CH3. The 1.7 ppm multiplet comes from the CH2 next to the CH(CH3). The 2.9 ppm is the CH(CH3). The 1.4 ppm is the methyl on the CH.

So that would fit the substituent being a sec-butyl group.

Now, the reaction: Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. But wait, if the starting material is a carboxylic acid, would Clemmensen work? No, because Clemmensen reduces ketones or aldehydes to alkanes, but carboxylic acids would not be reduced by that method.

Wait, but wait. If the starting material is a benzoic acid with a substituent, and it's undergoing a reaction with red phosphorus and HI, what would that do?

Wait, another possibility: when a carboxylic acid is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it can form an acid chloride. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, another reaction I recall is the reduction of esters or nitriles. But in this case, the starting material is a carboxylic acid.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again about the reaction conditions.

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, which is for the elimination of N2 from amines to produce alkanes. But that's not applicable here.

Wait, another reaction: when an alkyne is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it forms an alkane. But in this problem, the starting material isn't an alkyne.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of a carbonyl group. But the starting material is a carboxylic acid; that wouldn't be reduced by Clemmensen.

Wait, maybe the compound isn't a carboxylic acid. Let me reevaluate the IR and NMR data.

Alternative approach: Maybe the 10.5 ppm peak is not a carboxylic acid but an aldehyde. So if the IR shows a peak at 1720, which would be the aldehyde's carbonyl.

In that case, the substituents on the benzene ring are an aldehyde and another group.

But then, the NMR data would have a peak at 10.5 ppm for the aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually appear around 9-10 ppm as a singlet or a triplet if adjacent to a CH2. But in this case, it's a broad singlet, which might not fit an aldehyde. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acidic proton, like a phenol, but that's usually around 5-7 ppm.

Hmm, another possibility: the 10.5 ppm peak is an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. But then the carbonyl is at 1720, which seems high for a carboxylic acid.

Wait, maybe it's an ester. Because esters have carbonyls around 1720-1740 cm-1. So if the IR peak at 1720 is an ester, then the structure would be a benzene ring with an ester group and another substituent.

But looking at the NMR data, there's no ester oxygen in the structure, unless it's a methyl or ethyl ester, which would have certain peaks. But the data doesn't show any peaks that would correspond to an ester's CH3 groups, unless they're already accounted for.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ketone. Let's say the substituent on the benzene is a ketone (CO) and a isobutyl group.

But then, the 10.5 ppm peak would be something else. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the 10.5 ppm peak is an aldehyde, and the 1720 is the aldehyde's carbonyl. So the structure would be benzaldehyde with an isobutyl group.

In that case, the NMR would have a triplet for the aldehyde's adjacent CH2, but if the aldehyde is directly attached to the ring, the proton would be a singlet. But in the data, it's a broad singlet, which doesn't fit an aldehyde.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let me try to approach it from the reaction perspective.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. If the starting material has a carbonyl group, like a ketone, then the reaction would reduce it to a CH2 group. Alternatively, if the starting material is an ester, it might be hydrolyzed, but under what conditions?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the Clemmensen reduction to reduce ketones to alkanes. So if the starting material has a ketone group, it would be reduced to a CH2 group. So the product would have a CH2 where the ketone was.

So, let's assume that the starting material has a ketone group. Then, the product would have a CH2 group in that position.

Looking back at the NMR data, does the starting material have a ketone group?

The IR has a peak at 1720, which could be a ketone. The 10.5 ppm peak is a singlet, but ketones don't have protons. Wait, but in the starting material, perhaps the ketone is in a position that's not part of the aromatic ring. Maybe it's a propiophenone-type structure.

Wait, if the substituent is a ketone, like Ph-CO-R, then the starting material would have a carbonyl group. Upon reduction with Clemmensen, it would become Ph-CH2-R.

Looking at the options, let me see which options have a structure that would result from such a reduction.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That has a carboxylic acid group; maybe the starting material was a propionyl group.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a substituted toluene; perhaps an elimination product.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That has a carboxylic acid.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Another substituted toluene.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the starting material is a benzophenone derivative, which upon reduction becomes a benzyl group.

But none of the options seem to fit that.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde derivative with a substituent. When reduced with Clemmensen, the aldehyde becomes a CH2 group.

But looking at the options, I don't see a product with a CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester. If the starting material is an ester, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce it to an alcohol. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI can also be used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but that might not be relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an acyl chloride. But again, the data doesn't support that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. For example, if the starting material has a leaving group, like a tosyl group, the HI would substitute it with an iodide. But I don't see evidence of that in the data.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a benzyl group, and the reaction is adding HI across the double bond, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me try to think of the reaction again.

Red phosphorus and HI is a common reagent for the reduction of alkenes to alkanes via the hydroboration-oxidation? No, wait, that's BH3. Alternatively, the reaction could be a dehydrohalogenation or something else.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzene ring with a substituent that has a carbonyl group, like a ketone. When reduced, the ketone becomes a CH2 group. So, if the starting material is, say, para-methylacetophenone (Ph-C(O)-CH(CH3)2), then after reduction, it would become para-methylpropan-2-yl benzene, which would have a CH2 group.

But looking at the options, none of them directly match this. For example, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a propyl chain with a ketone.

Wait, another angle: looking at the options, perhaps the reaction is a substitution or elimination.

Let me consider option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If the starting material is this, and it is treated with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen?

Benzoic acid derivatives are generally not reactive towards Clemmensen conditions. So perhaps the reaction is something else.

Wait, maybe it's a reduction of an ester to an alcohol. But the product options don't show alcohols.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is cleavage of an ester to form a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. But that's more with aqueous conditions.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction where a leaving group is replaced by HI. For example, if the starting material has a bromide, it would be replaced by iodide. But in the options, I don't see iodide.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution on a benzyl position. But without seeing the structure, it's hard to tell.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to recap.

The starting material's NMR suggests a para-substituted benzene with a COOH group and a substituent that has a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- structure, which could be an isoamyl group or a similar substituent.

The IR suggests a carbonyl, which could be a carboxylic acid or an ester.

The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is likely a reduction. For a carboxylic acid, I don't think it would do much. But if it's an ester, perhaps it would reduce it.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is a benzophenone derivative, and the reaction reduces the ketone to a CH2 group.

For example, suppose the starting material is 4-(propiophenyl)benzene. Upon reduction, the ketone (propiophenone group) becomes a CH2 group.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde derivative. The aldehyde would be reduced to a CH2 group. But then, the product would have a CH2 where the aldehyde was.

But looking at the options, none of them show a CH2 group. So perhaps that's not the case.

Let me think about the options again.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If this is the starting material, and the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen? Since it's a carboxylic acid, I'm not sure it reacts. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is doing something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an elimination. If the starting material has a substituent that can eliminate, such as a vicinal dihalide, but that's not indicated in the data.

Another thought: when a carboxylic acid is treated with concentrated HI, it can form an acid iodide. But I don't think red phosphorus is involved in that reaction. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is forming an acyl iodide.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not a reduction but something else, like an alkylation.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alkyne. Treating an alkyne with red phosphorus and HI would form an alkane. But the IR shows a carbonyl, which wouldn't be present in an alkyne.

I'm getting stuck here, so maybe I should look for another approach.

Let me consider the options and see which one matches the NMR and IR data.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Structure: Benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The substituent on the ring would be a sec-butyl group, which is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the ring.

Wait, but then the substituent would have a structure that includes multiple CH2 groups and a CH group with a methyl attached.

In the NMR, the substituent's CH2 groups would show up as a triplet and a multiplet, and the CH group as a multiplet.

The COOH group would show the 10.5 ppm peak and the IR carbonyl peak.

So if the starting material is option C, and the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen?

Wait, if the starting material is benzoic acid with a substituent, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the carboxylic acid to a CH2 group. But that's not typically done under Clemmensen conditions. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is cleavage of the carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is being modified.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. If it were attached to a carbonyl, perhaps the reaction would reduce the carbonyl to CH2. But in option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group on the ring, with a COOH group.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material isn't option C, but another structure.

Wait, perhaps Compound X is a benzaldehyde derivative. Let me think, if X has a benzaldehyde group and a substituent, and upon reduction with red phosphorus and HI, the aldehyde becomes a CH2 group.

If that's the case, then the product would have a CH2 group where the aldehyde was.

Looking at the options, none of them directly show a CH2 group. So perhaps that's not the path.

Another thought: perhaps the starting material is an ester, like methyl benzoate. Then, reacting with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the ester to a CH2 group. But without the ester's NMR signals, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a nitrile group, which upon reduction would become an amine. But again, the data doesn't support that.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress. Let me try a different approach.

The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is likely a reduction. So the product would have a CH2 group where there was a carbonyl.

Thus, the starting material must have a carbonyl group. The product would have that group reduced.

Looking at the options, option C is a carboxylic acid, which doesn't have a carbonyl that would be reduced by Clemmensen. So perhaps the starting material isn't option C.

Alternatively, option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That's a propanoic acid attached to a benzene ring with an ethyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzophenone (a ketone attached to the benzene), and upon reduction, it becomes a CH2 group.

But without more info, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of an aromatic ester to a benzene ring with a CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a nitro group to an amine. But the data doesn't suggest a nitro group.

Wait, going back to the starting material's NMR. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH. The 2.9 ppm is the CH. The 1.7 ppm is CH2. The 0.9 ppm is CH2CH3.

So the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group. That's an isoamyl group.

So the substituent is an isoamyl group attached to the benzene ring. And the ring also has a COOH group.

So the starting material is 4-(isoamyl)benzoic acid.

But looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So perhaps isoamyl is similar to sec-butyl.

Wait, the isoamyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no, that's not the same. So perhaps the substituent is a different group.

But in any case, the reaction is a reduction. So, if the substituent has a carbonyl group that can be reduced, then the product would have a CH2 group.

Wait, but in the starting material, the substituent doesn't have a carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not a reduction but a substitution. For example, if the starting material has a bromide, it could be substituted with iodide. But the options don't include an iodide.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzene ring with a substituent that has an ester group. The ester would be reduced to a CH2 group.

But the data doesn't suggest an ester, as the IR peak is at 1720, which is typical for an ester, but the NMR doesn't show the ester's CH3 groups.

Wait, the IR at 1720 could be an ester. So, the starting material is an ester, and the reaction reduces it to an alcohol.

But again, the options don't show an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an elimination, creating a double bond. For example, if the starting material has a substituent with a CH2CH2 group, the reaction could form a double bond, giving an alkene.

But without more data, it's hard to say.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress, so perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the data.

The IR suggests a carbonyl group, which could be an ester or a ketone. The NMR suggests a structure with a para-substituted benzene, an acidic proton (possibly carboxylic acid), and a substituent with a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 group.

So the starting material is a carboxylic acid with a isoamyl group attached to the benzene ring.

The reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce any carbonyl groups. But since the carboxylic acid's carbonyl is at 1720, perhaps it's an ester, not a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the 10.5 ppm proton would then be something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a methyl benzoate with an isoamyl group. Upon reduction, the ester would become a CH2 group.

But then, the product would have a CH2 group where the ester was.

Looking at the options, option C is a benzoic acid, which might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an acetylated benzene, and the reaction reduces the acetyl group to a CH2.

But again, the options don't show this.

At this point, I'm not certain, but perhaps the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the reduction of the COOH group to a CH2 group, but I don't think that's possible under Clemmensen conditions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material is a benzophenone (a ketone attached to the benzene ring), and the reaction reduces the ketone to a CH2 group. So the product would be a benzyl group.

But without seeing the structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a ketone substituent. For example, 4-phenylpropanone. Reduction would give 4-phenylpropane, which is 4-(propyl)benzene.

But again, the options don't include that.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Based on the data, I think the starting material is a para-substituted benzene with a COOH group and a substituent that includes a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 group. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce any carbonyl groups. If the substituent is a ketone, it would be reduced. But I can't find an option that fits this.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't a reduction but something else. Maybe the starting material has a bromine which is substituted by iodide. But the NMR doesn't show peaks indicative of a bromide.

In conclusion, I'm not confident, but I'll go with option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product of a reaction involving Compound X, which has given IR and NMR data, reacting with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### Analysis of Compound X
1. **IR Data**:
   - **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Suggests an O-H or N-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid due to the broad nature.
   - **1720 cm⁻¹**: Indicates a carbonyl group, possibly from a carboxylic acid, ester, or ketone.
   - **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching, suggesting a substituted benzene ring.

2. **NMR Data**:
   - **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: Likely the O-H proton of a carboxylic acid, broad due to hydrogen bonding.
   - **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Aromatic protons, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
   - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: Suggest a branched alkyl chain, likely an isobutyl or similar group.

From this data, Compound X is inferred to be a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an isobutyl group (-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂) in the para positions.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones or aldehydes to alkanes. However, the starting material is a carboxylic acid, which is not typically reduced under these conditions. Therefore, the reaction likely does not involve the carboxylic acid group but may affect another part of the molecule.

### Evaluation of Options
1. **Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**  
   This structure does not match the NMR data, as it lacks the isobutyl group indicated by the NMR peaks.

2. **Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**  
   This structure does not include a carboxylic acid group, which is supported by the IR and NMR data.

3. **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**  
   This structure matches the data: a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a sec-butyl group (-CH₂CH(CH₃)CH₂-) in the para positions. The NMR peaks are consistent with the sec-butyl group and the carboxylic acid proton.

4. **Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**  
   This structure lacks a carboxylic acid group, which is inconsistent with the IR and NMR data.

### Conclusion
The most consistent structure for Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI does not alter the carboxylic acid group, and the product remains the same as the starting material. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
