Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So, I think I need to calculate two things: the relative velocity and the total energy.

Starting with relative velocity. Wait, I remember that when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just subtract their speeds like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed would be the difference, but according to the formula. So let me plug in the numbers.

V1 is 0.6c, V2 is 0.5c. So substituting:

(v_rel) = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)) 

Simplify the numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So (0.1c) / 0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c ≈ 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, that would point towards options C or D, which have 0.14c.

Now, for the total energy. Total energy in relativity includes rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. Wait, but sometimes people think of total energy as just the sum of the two energies. Or is it the sum of rest energies plus their kinetic energies? Or does it require considering their velocities and gamma factors?

Each astronaut's total energy (rest plus kinetic) is given by gamma times mc². So for each, we calculate gamma and multiply by their mass.

Wait, no, the problem says the masses are 2m and 3m. So astronaut 1 has mass 2m, speed 0.6c. His gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So his total energy is gamma * m_total * c². Wait, does the m in the equation include his own mass?

Wait, no, the energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So for astronaut 1, it's gamma1 * (2m)c². Similarly for astronaut 2.

So let's compute each:

Astronaut 1:
v = 0.6c
gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1.25
E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2:
v = 0.5c
gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547
E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈1.1547 *3 m c² ≈3.464 m c².

So total energy is E1 + E2 ≈2.5 +3.464 =5.964 m c². Hmm, 5.964 is close to 5.96, which is option C.

Looking back at the options:

Option C says v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². So that's matching.

Option D says E=5mc². Wait, that's the sum if we didn't account for gamma. Like 2m +3m=5m, and E=5mc². But that's only the rest energy, ignoring their kinetic energies. So no, the correct total energy is higher than that.

So the correct answer should be option C: relative speed 0.14c and E=5.96mc².

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system for two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Relative Speed
The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\):

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 \approx 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 = 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**
