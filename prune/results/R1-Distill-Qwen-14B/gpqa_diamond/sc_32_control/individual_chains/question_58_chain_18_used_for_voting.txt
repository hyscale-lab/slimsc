Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, like infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a cutoff or something to handle the divergent integrals. But not all theories require this, I guess.

So, let's think about each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. Wait, I thought string theory is a theory of quantum gravity, right? And it's supposed to be a background-independent theory. But wait, does it require regularization? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think superstring theory doesn't have the same types of divergences as, say, quantum electrodynamics (QED) because it's formulated with strings instead of point particles. Strings might inherently avoid some divergences, especially at high energies. Or maybe because it's a theory that unifies forces and gravity, it's free from some of the problems that other QFTs have. Or is that not the case? I'm not entirely sure.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, right? I remember that QCD has something called asymptotic freedom, where the coupling becomes weak at high energies. But when you calculate loop diagrams, especially in perturbation theory, you get divergences. So, you need to regularize those. Regularization methods like lattice regularization or dimensional regularization are used. So QCD does require regularization. So option B is out.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism with quantum mechanics. It's a well-understood theory and has been very successful. But wait, doesn't QED have issues with divergences when calculating things like the electron self-energy or photon vacuum polarization? Yes, I remember that. So you have to regularize the infinities, like using a cutoff or other methods, and then renormalize the theory to get finite results. So QED requires regularization. So option C is not the answer.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, that's the non-quantum version. So in classical E&M, do you deal with infinities? For example, the electric field of a point charge is infinite at the origin. But wait, in classical theory, how do they handle that? I think in classical physics, those infinities are problematic, but maybe you don't use regularization in the same way as in quantum theories. Because regularization is a quantum field theory concept, right? It's about handling divergent integrals in perturbative expansions. So in classical E&M, you don't have these divergent loop diagrams because there are no virtual particles or loops. So maybe classical electrodynamics doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory. Hmm, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization at high energies. So if a theory doesn't involve quantum aspects, then it doesn't need regularization in the same sense.

Wait, but the question is about high energies. At high energies, does classical E&M break down because you need quantum effects? So perhaps the point is that for the theory itself, whether it's a QFT or not. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me re-express the question. The question is which theory never requires regularization. So which of these theories doesn't have divergences that need to be regularized.

So thinking again: QED and QCD are both QFTs and require regularization because they have divergent loop integrals. Superstring theory is a QFT as well, but perhaps it doesn't need regularization because the underlying framework is different. Or maybe I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps string theory, being a background-independent theory, doesn't require the same type of regularization. Or perhaps it's because string theories (like superstring theory) are finite, meaning they don't have the same divergences that QFTs have. Wait, I've heard that string theories are perturbatively finite, but I'm not entirely certain. Perturbatively, maybe, but I think in practice, string theories may still require some form of regularization when dealing with certain limits. Or perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe in the full theory, they don't because they have a different structure.

Classical E&M doesn't have the same issues because it's not a quantum theory. So when you go to high energies, you might be approaching the domain where quantum effects are important, meaning that classical E&M isn't valid anymore. But the question is about the theory's requirements. So, does the theory ever require regularization? Since regularization is a quantum thing, classical E&M doesn't require it. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but the question says which theory never requires regularization. So D, classical E&M, doesn't require regularization at all, whereas the other options (A, B, C) are QFTs and do require regularization.

So the correct answer would be D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, but wait another thought. The question says "at high energies." So perhaps the other theories require regularization at high energies, but D doesn't. Because in high energy, maybe the regularization isn't necessary for classical E&M.

Alternatively, considering that regularization is needed in quantum theories, so if a theory isn't quantum, it doesn't require it. So the only theory that is not a quantum field theory among the options is D: classical E&M.

So looking at the options again, the answer is D.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the options based on their need for regularization, a technique used in quantum field theories (QFTs) to handle divergences in calculations.

- **Option A: Superstring Theory**  
  Superstring theory is a quantum theory of gravity and unifies forces using strings instead of point particles. While it is a QFT, it is formulated in a way that avoids some of the divergences seen in other QFTs. However, regularization may still be required in certain contexts, such as perturbative calculations. Thus, it is not clear that it never requires regularization.

- **Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**  
  QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, describing quarks and gluons. It is a non-abelian gauge theory and requires regularization due to divergences in loop diagrams. Techniques like dimensional or lattice regularization are commonly used. Therefore, QCD requires regularization.

- **Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**  
  QED is the theory of electromagnetism in quantum mechanics. It is well-established but suffers from divergences in loop calculations, such as the self-energy of electrons and vacuum polarization. These divergences necessitate regularization and renormalization. Hence, QED requires regularization.

- **Option D: Classical Electrodynamics**  
  Classical electrodynamics is the non-quantum theory of electricity and magnetism. It does not involve the divergences associated with quantum field theories because it lacks virtual particles and loop diagrams. Regularization is a concept specific to QFTs, so classical electrodynamics does not require regularization at any energy scale, including high energies.

Based on this analysis, the theory that never requires regularization at high energies is **Classical Electrodynamics**.
