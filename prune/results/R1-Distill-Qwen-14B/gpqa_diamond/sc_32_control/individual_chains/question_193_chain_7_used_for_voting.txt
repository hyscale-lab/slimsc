Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the relationship between the number of stars and distance based on the given parallax relation. Hmm. Let me try to break it down.

The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the formula would be like N ∝ 1/plx^5. Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance, so plx = 1/distance. But wait, I think the formula is plx (in parsecs) equals 1 over the distance in parsecs. So if the distance is r, then plx is 1/r. 

Wait, the problem is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So, the number N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to r, let's substitute that into the equation. 

So, plx = 1/r. Substituting that into N gives N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's compute that. The denominator becomes (1/r)^5, which is 1/(r^5). So 1 divided by that would be r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. 

Wait, but wait. The question is about the change in the number of stars with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh, right. So are we talking about how the number of stars increases as you go to a larger distance, considering a small change in distance? Or is it the number per unit distance?

Wait, the problem says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)"? Hmm, maybe I should think about it in terms of differential number. Like, how does N change as r changes by a small amount.

Wait, N ∝ r^5. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the change in N with respect to r (dN/dr) would be proportional to 5 r^4. But wait, the question is about per unit range of distance. So like, for each unit increase in r, how much does N increase? That would be the derivative, right? So dN/dr ~ r^4. But wait, the options don't have r^4 as the answer. Wait, let me check the options again.

The options are A) r^3, B) r^5, C) r^4, D) r^2. Oh wait, option C is r^4. So if dN/dr is proportional to r^4, that would be option C. But wait, I'm a bit confused here because the question says N varies as 1/plx^5, which is r^5. So N itself is proportional to r^5. But the question is about how the number changes with distance. So if each unit distance adds more stars, the rate of change is dN/dr. So that's the derivative of r^5, which is 5 r^4. So the change per unit distance is proportional to r^4, so the answer would be C.

But wait, wait another moment. The problem is a bit ambiguous. It says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/r, N is proportional to r^5. So the number itself increases as r^5. So the number is increasing more rapidly as you go further out. But the question is about how the number changes with distance. So the change in N with r is dN/dr = 5 r^4. So the rate of increase is proportional to r^4, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about the dependence of the number on distance. So if N = k * r^5, then for a given distance, the number is proportional to r^5. So if you double the distance, you get 32 times the number of stars. But the question is about the change per unit of distance. So the per unit change would be the derivative, which is option C.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question is phrased as "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". Oh, perhaps they're asking how the number of stars increases with distance, so the trend is N ∝ r^5, which would be answer B.

Wait, but the options include 'how the number changes with distance per unit range'. So maybe the question is about the number of stars per unit distance, which would be the derivative. Because if you're looking at how many more stars are present when you move a unit distance further, that's like the rate of change. So perhaps that's r^4, which is option C.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The problem states 'the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5'. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to r, plx = 1/r. So N ∝ r^5. So N increases with r^5.

But the question is about how the number changes with distance. So if you're looking at the number of stars as a function of r, it's N(r) = kr^5. So the number of stars increases with r^5. So the answer would be answer B.

Wait, but the question says, "how does the number of stars ... change with distance per unit range of distance". So per unit distance, so like, the number in a slice dr. So the number in a shell of thickness dr at radius r would be the rate of change of N with r multiplied by dr. Because N(r) is the cumulative number up to distance r. So if N(r) is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell dr is dN = 5 k r^4 dr. So the number per unit distance (dr) would be proportional to r^4, which is option C.

But wait, I'm getting conflicting interpretations. The question could be interpreted either way. Let me read the question again.

The question states: "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So, perhaps it's asking for how the number of stars in the region (a volume) changes as you go to a larger distance. So the total number of stars in the region would be proportional to r^5. So the change with distance would be this dependence.

Alternatively, if the region is a shell at distance r with thickness dr, then the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to r^4 dr. So per unit distance, it's r^4.

But the question is a bit ambiguous. It says "the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance)". So the way the number changes as you look at a range of distances, per unit of that range.

Wait, perhaps the initial relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. But plx is 1/r, so N ∝ r^5.

So when the distance increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. So the change is proportional to r^5, which would be option B.

Alternatively, if someone thinks in terms of volume. The number density of stars might be such that the total number in a volume is proportional to r^3 (since volume is r^3). But in this case, the question states the number varies as 1/plx^5, which is r^5, so that's a different relation.

Wait, perhaps the initial statement is that the number of stars (per some unit) in a region varies as 1/plx^5. Wait, but the question says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N = k / plx^5. Since plx is 1/r, N = k r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

So the number of stars increases with r^5. So the dependence is r^5, which is option B.

But wait, the question says 'how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance)'. So maybe it's not the total number, but the number per unit distance. In that case, the number per unit distance would be the derivative, which is dN/dr = 5 k r^4. So it's proportional to r^4, which is option C.

So now I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again. How does the number of stars in the region of the sky change with distance, per unit range. So if you have a region of the sky (so same solid angle), and you look at stars at different distances, the number in that region varies with 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 = r^5.

So for a given region (same area on the sky), the number of stars increases as you go to larger distances, but the rate of increase is faster. So the total number up to distance r is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but per unit distance, like in each small slice dr, the number would be dN = 5k r^4 dr. So the number per unit distance would be proportional to r^4. So, if the question is about the number of stars per unit distance, that's r^4, option C.

But the wording is a bit ambiguous. The question says "the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance)".

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the number of stars per unit distance. That would make sense. So for each additional unit of distance, how many more stars are there? That would be the derivative, which is r^4. So the answer would be C.

But I'm a bit confused because I'm not 100% sure about the wording. Let's try to think: if N is proportional to r^5, then the number increases as you go further. So the change in N per unit change in r is 5 r^4. So that would be how the number changes per unit distance.

So in that case, the answer is option C, r^4.

Wait, but the options given are A: r^3, B: r^5, C: r^4, D: r^2.

So I think the correct answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), we have \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this into the equation gives:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5
\]

This means the total number of stars in the region of the sky increases as \( r^5 \) with distance. However, the question specifically asks how the number of stars "changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \))". This refers to the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which is the derivative:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \). Among the given options:

- **A) \( r^3 \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is not cubic.
- **B) \( r^5 \):** Incorrect, as this represents the total number of stars, not the change per unit distance.
- **C) \( r^4 \):** Correct, as the change per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).
- **D) \( r^2 \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is not quadratic.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
