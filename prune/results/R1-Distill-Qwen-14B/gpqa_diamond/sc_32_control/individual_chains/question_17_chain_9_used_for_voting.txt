Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see, what's it about? Alright, the question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a certain concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds to ions like calcium. 

The problem states that the concentration of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Oh wait, and the K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and temperature is 25°C. I'm supposed to find the concentration of free calcium ions. 

I think I need to use the formula for the dissociation of the complex. So the overall reaction would be something like Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-. The formation constant, K, is given, which I believe is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. Wait, formation constants are usually given as Kf, which is [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). 

Right, so K is 5e10. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and I assume that the EDTA and calcium are in a 1:1 ratio because it's a stoichiometric complex. So, when the complex dissociates, it'll release Ca²+ and EDTA in a 1:1 ratio. 

So, let's set up the variables. Let's say the concentration of the complex at equilibrium is 0.02 - x, but wait, no. Actually, when the complex dissociates, the concentration decreases by x, and the products increase by x each. So, at equilibrium, [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x, [Ca²+] = x, and [EDTA] = x. 

But wait, since the K is so large (5e10), the dissociation will be very small. So x will be much smaller than 0.02. Therefore, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That simplifies the calculation. 

So, K = [Ca²+][EDTA] / [Ca-EDTA] → K = (x)(x)/(0.02). So K = x² / 0.02. 

Solving for x: x² = K * 0.02 → x² = (5e10) * 0.02. Let's compute that. 5e10 is 50,000,000,000. Multiply by 0.02: 50,000,000,000 * 0.02 = 1,000,000,000. So x² = 1e9. Taking the square root, x = sqrt(1e9) = 31622.776... which is approximately 3.16e4. Wait, wait, that can't be right because the initial concentration is 0.02 M, and x would be 3e4 which is way larger than 0.02. That doesn't make sense. Oh, no, wait, I think I messed up the calculation. Let me double-check. 

Wait, no, I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, let me go back. K is 5e10. So x² = 5e10 * 0.02. 5e10 * 0.02 is 1e9, right? So x^2 = 1e9 → x = sqrt(1e9) = 31622.776, which is 3.16e4. Wait, but if the solution is 0.02 M, how can x be 3e4 M? That's impossible because that would require the concentration of Ca²+ to be way higher than the initial concentration. So I must have made a mistake in setting up the equation. 

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. The correct formation constant is Kf = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). So, rearranged, [Ca²+] = [Ca-EDTA]/(Kf * [EDTA]). But since [Ca-EDTA] is 0.02 and [EDTA] is x, [Ca²+] is 0.02/(Kf * x). But that might not help directly. 

Alternatively, since K is so large, the complex is very stable, so the dissociation is minimal. So, x is much smaller than 0.02, so [Ca-EDTA] ≈0.02. Therefore, K ≈ x²/(0.02) → x²=0.02*K → x= sqrt(0.02*K). 

Wait, but plugging in the numbers again: 0.02 *5e10 = 1e9. So x is sqrt(1e9) = 31622.776 M. Wait, that's 31,622 M, which is way higher than the initial 0.02 M. That's impossible because you can't have more product than the reactant. So this suggests that the assumption that x is much smaller than 0.02 is wrong. That can't be right. 

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think. The formation constant Kf is given as 5e10. The complex is Ca-EDTA, so when it dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and EDTA. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, initially, [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02, [Ca²+] = 0, [EDTA]=0. As it dissociates, let's say the change is x. So at equilibrium, [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA] = x. 

The K expression is Kf = (x)(x)/(0.02 - x) ≈ (x²)/(0.02) if x is small. But if x is not small, then I can't neglect x in the denominator. So perhaps x isn't negligible. So I can't make that approximation. 

Wait, but Kf is 5e10, which is a very large number, implying that the complex is very stable. So the dissociation is very small, so x should be much less than 0.02. But why did the earlier calculation give x as 3e4? That doesn't make sense. 

Wait, perhaps I inverted the K expression. Let me clarify. The formation constant is Kf = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). So in this case, the dissociation is the reverse. The dissociation constant, Kd, would be 1/Kf. Because Kd is the equilibrium constant for the reverse reaction. 

Ah, yes! That's a crucial point. So I'm probably using the wrong K in my equation. Because in the dissociation, the K is actually Kd = 1/Kf. 

So, the dissociation reaction is Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-, and its Kd = 1/(Kf) = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. 

So, the correct K for the dissociation is 2e-11. So the expression is Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA]/[Ca-EDTA]. 

So, Kd = x^2 / (0.02 - x). Since Kd is very small (2e-11), x will be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. 

So, substituting, Kd ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = Kd * 0.02 = (2e-11) * 0.02 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → wait, 2e-6.5 is the same as sqrt(4e-13) which is 2e-6.5? Hmm, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13, square root is 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, but 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7, so 2*3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7. So x≈6.32e-7 M. 

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3e-7 M. 

That makes sense because with such a high Kf, the dissociation is minimal, so the concentration of free Ca²+ is very low. So the correct answer should be option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{Ca-EDTA} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

At equilibrium, let the concentration of dissociated \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \) be \( x \). The equilibrium concentrations are:

\[
[\text{Ca-EDTA}] \approx 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \quad (\text{since } x \ll 0.02)
\]
\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x
\]

The equilibrium expression for \( K_d \) is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{Ca-EDTA}]}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
K_d = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = K_d \cdot 0.02 = (2 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot 0.02 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**.
