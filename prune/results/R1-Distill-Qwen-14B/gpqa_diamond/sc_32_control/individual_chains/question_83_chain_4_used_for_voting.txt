Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. We start by diluting 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. Then we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, the pH changes because the concentration of H+ ions decreases. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. The first thing I need to do is find out the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution.

So initially, we have 20 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. The number of moles is Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles of acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles/volume. 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but when we dilute a weak acid, the dissociation increases a bit, but for the initial pH, maybe I can approximate it using the formula for weak acids. The formula is pH = ½ (pKa - log C), right? Where C is the concentration.

The Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) = about 4.74, wait, let me calculate that accurately. Let me think, 1.85e-5 is the Ka. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let's compute that.

Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733, approximately 4.73.

So the pH before any titration is ½ (4.73 - log(0.025)). Wait, 0.025 is 2.5e-2. Log(0.025) is log(2.5e-2) which is log(2.5) + log(1e-2). Log(2.5) is about 0.39794, and log(1e-2) is -2. So total log is 0.39794 -2 = -1.60206.

So pH = (4.73 - (-1.60206))/2 = (4.73 +1.60206)/2 = 6.33206/2 = 3.166. So about 3.17. Wait, but that's the pH before any titration? Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because when we dilute the solution, the concentration is lower, so the pH should be higher, right? Because diluting a weak acid makes it less dissociated but more ions, but wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, no. Wait, the initial pH before adding NaOH is what I just calculated, which is around 3.17?

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you dilute it, the pH should actually increase, not decrease. Because when you make the solution weaker, the dissociation increases a bit. But wait, let's think again.

Wait, the initial solution before dilution: 0.05 M acetic acid. Let's compute its pH.

For 0.05 M CH3COOH, Ka = 1.85e-5. Let's assume x is the [H+].

Ka = x² / (0.05 -x) ≈ x²/0.05, since x is small.

x² ≈ 0.05 * 1.85e-5 = 9.25e-7.

x = sqrt(9.25e-7) ≈ 3.04e-4. So pH is about 3.51.

After dilution to 0.025 M, the pH should be higher than 3.51. Because the concentration is lower, so the acid is weaker, and the pH should rise. So in my earlier calculation, I found about 3.17, but that's lower, which can't be right. So I must have messed up the calculation.

Wait, let me redo that. pH = ½ (pKa - log C). So C is 0.025 M, which is 2.5e-2. So log(2.5e-2) is log(2.5) + log(1e-2) = 0.39794 -2 = -1.60206.

So pH = ½ (4.733 - (-1.60206)) = ½ (6.33506) = 3.1675. Hmm, but that's lower than 3.51. That can't be right. So I'm getting confused here.

Wait a second, maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Let me think again. The formula pH = ½ (pKa - log C) is correct for a weak acid where the concentration is much higher than the ionization. But maybe when the solution is diluted, the assumption that [H+] is sqrt(Ka*C) isn't valid anymore if the concentration is too low.

Wait, 0.025 M is 25 mM. Ka is 1.85e-5. So the initial assumption is that x^2 = Ka*C. Let's check that.

x^2 = 1.85e-5 * 0.025 = 4.625e-7.

x = sqrt(4.625e-7) ≈ 6.8e-4 M. pH is -log(6.8e-4) ≈ 3.17.

Hmm, so the initial pH after dilution is indeed about 3.17, which is lower than the initial 3.51? That can't be. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3.17 is lower than 3.51, so the pH decreased when we diluted it. That doesn't make sense. Diluting a weak acid should increase the pH because the solution becomes less concentrated, but I'm getting a lower pH. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recalculate the initial pH before dilution.

Initial concentration is 0.05 M. So x² = 0.05 * 1.85e-5 = 9.25e-7. x ≈ 3.04e-4, pH ≈ 3.51.

After dilution to 0.025 M, x² = 0.025 * 1.85e-5 = 4.625e-7, x ≈ 6.8e-4, pH ≈ 3.17.

Wait, that's lower pH. But when you dilute a weak acid, the solution becomes less concentrated, so the degree of dissociation should increase, but the pH should increase. So why am I getting a lower pH? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, wait. Because when you dilute a weak acid, the pH actually increases. But according to my calculations, it's decreasing. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let's think again. Let's compute the pH of the diluted solution more accurately.

For 0.025 M acetic acid, Ka=1.85e-5.

We can set up the equation: Ka = [H+][A-]/[HA] = (x)(x)/(0.025 -x) = 1.85e-5.

Assuming x is small compared to 0.025, so 0.025 -x ≈ 0.025.

So x² ≈ 0.025 * 1.85e-5 = 4.625e-7.

x ≈ sqrt(4.625e-7) ≈ 6.8e-4. So [H+] is 6.8e-4, so pH is about 3.17.

Wait, but 6.8e-4 is 0.00068, which is the [H+], so pH is about 3.17.

Wait, but for the initial 0.05 M solution, the [H+] was 3.04e-4, so pH 3.51.

So after dilution, [H+] is higher (from 3.04e-4 to 6.8e-4), so pH is lower. That seems contradictory because I thought diluting a weak acid makes pH higher. Hmm, wait, perhaps I'm confusing the effect. Wait, in a weak acid, the solution is more dissociated when diluted. Wait, but more dissociation would produce more H+ ions, leading to higher [H+], which would lower pH. But that's the opposite of what I thought earlier.

Wait, that can’t be right. Because if you have a weak acid, say 0.1 M, and you dilute it to 0.01 M, the solution is more dissociated. So the [H+] should be higher than sqrt(Ka * 0.1), but lower than sqrt(Ka * 0.01). Wait, no, wait.

Wait, for a weak acid, when you dilute it, the degree of ionization increases, so the concentration of H+ increases, but less than it would if the acid were strong. So for example, if you have a strong acid like HCl, diluting it would decrease [H+]. But for a weak acid, diluting it makes [H+] increase, but not as much as a strong acid. So the pH of the weak acid increases when diluted, but not as much as in a strong acid.

Wait, but in our calculations, diluting from 0.05 M to 0.025 M (so more dilute) leads to a higher [H+], making pH lower. But that's impossible because when you dilute a weak acid, the pH should increase, not decrease. So I'm getting conflicting results here. I must have made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Let's take a specific example. Let's say you have 0.1 M acetic acid. The pH is around 2.87.

If you dilute it to 0.01 M, the pH increases to around 2.94. Wait, wait, that's an increase. Wait, wait, according to my memory, when you dilute a weak acid, the pH increases, but not as much as a strong acid. So going from 0.1 M to 0.01 M, the pH increases from around 2.87 to 2.94, which is correct.

Wait, but according to my calculation earlier, I found that the initial 0.05 M has pH 3.51, and 0.025 M has pH 3.17. That would mean the pH is lower when diluted, which is incorrect.

Wait, so I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

Ka = 1.85e-5.

For 0.05 M acetic acid:

x² = 0.05 * 1.85e-5 = 9.25e-7, x ≈ 3.04e-4 → pH ≈ 3.51.

After dilution to 0.025 M:

x² = 0.025 * 1.85e-5 = 4.625e-7 → x ≈ 6.8e-4 → pH ≈ 3.17.

Wait, that's a lower pH. But that's contradictory because the pH should increase when diluting. Hmm. So where's the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the effect. Maybe when you dilute a weak acid, the pH does increase, but perhaps in my approach, I'm considering the wrong solution. Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately without the approximation.

Let me solve the equation without assuming x is negligible.

For 0.025 M:

Ka = x² / (0.025 - x) = 1.85e-5.

So x² = 1.85e-5 * (0.025 - x).

x² = 4.625e-7 - 1.85e-5 x.

Rearranged: x² + 1.85e-5 x - 4.625e-7 = 0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a)

Here, a=1, b=1.85e-5, c= -4.625e-7.

Discriminant D = (1.85e-5)^2 +4*1*4.625e-7.

Compute D: (3.4225e-10) + 1.85e-6 = approx 1.85e-6. Let's compute exactly.

Wait: 1.85e-5 squared is (1.85)^2 * (1e-10) = 3.4225e-10.

4ac is 4 * 1 * (-4.625e-7) = -1.85e-6. So when multiplied by -1 in the equation, it's positive 1.85e-6.

So D = 3.4225e-10 + 1.85e-6 ≈ 1.85034225e-6.

Square root of D is sqrt(1.85034225e-6) ≈ 1.36e-3.

So x = [-1.85e-5 ± 1.36e-3]/2.

We take the positive root: ( -1.85e-5 + 1.36e-3 ) / 2 ≈ (0.0013415) / 2 ≈ 0.00067075 M. So x ≈ 6.7075e-4 M.

pH = -log(6.7075e-4) ≈ 3.17. So the initial calculation was correct. So the pH after dilution is about 3.17. So that's lower than the initial 3.51. Which can't be right because that would mean diluting the acid makes it more acidic, which isn't the case.

Wait, this is confusing. According to calculations, diluting the acetic acid from 0.05 M to 0.025 M makes the pH go down from 3.51 to 3.17, but that's impossible because a more dilute solution should be less acidic, making the pH higher.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation for 0.05 M.

Wait, let's recompute the 0.05 M case accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5.

x² = 0.05 * 1.85e-5 = 9.25e-7 → x ≈ 3.04e-4 → pH ≈ 3.51.

But if after dilution, the pH is 3.17, which is lower, that can't be right. So I must be missing something.

Wait a minute, perhaps I confused the initial and diluted concentrations. Wait, the problem states that we're titrating the diluted solution. So the initial pH after dilution is about 3.17. But that would mean the pH is lower than before, which seems wrong. So I'm definitely making a mistake here.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong approach. Let me try a different approach. Let's calculate the concentration of H+ after dilution without approximations.

For 0.025 M, the equation is:

Ka = x²/(0.025 - x) = 1.85e-5.

I can write this as x² = 1.85e-5 (0.025 - x).

Which is x² = 4.625e-7 - 1.85e-5 x.

Rearranged: x² + 1.85e-5 x -4.625e-7 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a)

a=1, b=1.85e-5, c=-4.625e-7.

Discriminant D = (1.85e-5)^2 +4*1*(4.625e-7) = 3.4225e-10 + 1.85e-6 = approximately 1.85034225e-6.

sqrt(D) = sqrt(1.85034225e-6) ≈ 1.36e-3.

So x = [ -1.85e-5 + 1.36e-3 ] / 2 → (0.0013415)/2 ≈ 0.00067075 M. So x ≈ 6.7075e-4 M. That's [H+] = 6.7075e-4, pH ≈ 3.17.

Hmm, that's the same as before. So the pH after dilution is indeed 3.17, which is lower than the initial 3.51. But that can't be right. I must be missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the initial solution before dilution. Let me re-calculate the initial pH.

Initial solution: 0.05 M acetic acid.

Ka = 1.85e-5.

x² = 0.05 * 1.85e-5 → x² = 9.25e-7 → x ≈ 3.04e-4 → pH ≈ 3.51.

Wait, that's correct, I think. Now, when I dilute it to 0.025 M, the pH goes down to 3.17, which is more acidic. That doesn't make sense. Because when you dilute a weak acid, the pH should increase because the solution is less concentrated and the degree of ionization increases, but the [H+] isn't as high as a strong acid.

Wait, maybe I have a misunderstanding here. Let me think about the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). At the initial 0.05 M solution, [A-] is x, and [HA] is approximately 0.05. After dilution, [HA] is 0.025, but [A-] is higher because of more dissociation. Wait, but according to the calculations, [H+] is higher, so pH is lower.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the fact that when you dilute, the solution becomes more neutral, so the pH should increase. So the initial pH after dilution should be higher than 3.51. So why does the calculation give me a lower pH?

Ah, I think I'm making a mistake in my calculations. Let me double-check. Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. Let's take a different approach. Let's compute the pH using the exact formula without assuming x is negligible.

For 0.025 M solution, the equation is:

Ka = (x)(x)/(0.025 - x) = 1.85e-5.

Which gives x² = 1.85e-5 (0.025 - x).

x² = 4.625e-7 - 1.85e-5 x.

Rearranged: x² + 1.85e-5 x -4.625e-7 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² +4ac) ] / (2a).

With a=1, b=1.85e-5, c=-4.625e-7.

Discriminant: (1.85e-5)^2 +4*1*4.625e-7 = 3.4225e-10 + 1.85e-6 = 1.85034225e-6.

sqrt(1.85034225e-6) ≈ 1.36e-3.

So x = [ -1.85e-5 + 1.36e-3 ] / 2 → (0.0013415)/2 ≈ 0.00067075 M → 6.7075e-4.

So [H+] is ~6.7e-4, pH is ~3.17.

Wait, that's correct according to the math, but it's contradicting what I thought about dilution. So perhaps I'm wrong about the effect of dilution on pH for weak acids. Or maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, another approach: maybe the initial calculation is correct, and the pH after dilution is 3.17. So when we start titrating with NaOH, the initial pH is 3.17. Then, when 25% of it is titrated, what's the pH?

Wait, but the question is about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

So perhaps I should proceed to calculate those.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the steps step by step.

First, find the concentration of the diluted acetic acid.

Diluted volume is 40 cm³ (20 + 20). The moles are 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Correct.

Now, when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH. Let's find the equivalence point.

Moles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol. To neutralize, NaOH will donate OH- to convert CH3COOH to CH3COO^- Na^+.

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.

Moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 mol.

Volume of NaOH needed: moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration and equivalence point.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid is neutralized.

So moles neutralized: 0.001 * 0.25 = 0.00025 mol.

Volume of NaOH used: 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to calculate the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

At 25% titration: 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate.

So, the solution is a buffer solution with some acetic acid and some acetate ions.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be used here.

The initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

At 25% titration, 25% of the 0.001 mol (0.00025 mol) has been neutralized. So moles of CH3COOH remaining = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed = 0.00025 mol.

But wait, when we add 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH to 40 cm³ of the diluted solution, the total volume becomes 42.5 cm³.

So the concentrations of CH3COOH and CH3COO^- are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Using Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) ≈ -0.4771.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.4771 ≈ 4.256.

So approximately 4.26. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should consider the dilution more accurately. Because when you add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH to the 40 cm³ solution, the total volume is 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the volumes are additive, but perhaps it's better to proceed with the calculation as done.

So at 25% titration, pH is about 4.26.

Now, at equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate ions. The solution is now a solution of sodium acetate.

The sodium acetate will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

Moles of sodium acetate at equivalence point: 0.001 mol.

Volume of solution: let's see, the initial solution is 40 cm³, and the NaOH added is 10 cm³ (since equivalence is 10 cm³, as we calculated earlier). So total volume is 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

Concentration of sodium acetate: 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

The concentration is 0.02 M.

Using the approximation for weak bases:

[OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98.

So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have pH 9.02. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck the Kb calculation.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10. Correct.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

So [OH^-] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

Wait, wait, sqrt(1.081e-11) is approximately 3.29e-6, so [OH^-] is 3.29e-6.

pOH = -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.486.

So pH = 14 -5.486 ≈ 8.514.

Ah, that's about 8.51. So at equivalence point, pH is approximately 8.51.

Looking back at the options, option A has pH at equivalence point as 8.52, which matches this.

So at 25% titration, pH is about 4.26, and at equivalence, about 8.52. So the answer is option A.

Wait, but earlier, the initial pH after dilution was calculated as 3.17, but that's before any NaOH is added. So maybe that's the pH before titration, but the question asks about the pH during titration.

Wait, but the question is about the pH at 25% titration and equivalence point. So the pH at 25% is approximately 4.26 and equivalence is 8.52. So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but in the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. So that's the correct option.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.04 \, \text{L}.
\]

The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.04} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### pH at 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of acetic acid remaining are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ions formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ions are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.0059}{0.0176} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.48 = 4.25.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.

### pH at the Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming sodium acetate. The moles of sodium acetate are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of sodium acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.020 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion acts as a weak base, hydrolyzing in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \(K_b\) for acetate is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation for weak bases:

\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot C} = \sqrt{(5.41 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot (0.020)} = \sqrt{1.08 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
