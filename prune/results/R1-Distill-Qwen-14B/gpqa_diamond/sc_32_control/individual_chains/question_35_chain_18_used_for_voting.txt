Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that Ay is given by c multiplied by the matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π). Wait, what's S? Oh, the matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So S looks like this:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

Right. And Ay is c * S. So substituting c, Ay would be (h/(4π)) multiplied by this matrix.

So, Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. Let's compute that. The first element is (h/(4π)) * 0 = 0. The top right is (h/(4π)) * (-i) = (-i h)/(4π). The bottom left is (i h)/(4π), and the bottom right is 0. So,

Ay = [ [0, (-i h)/(4π)],
        [(i h)/(4π), 0] ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues a of Ay, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), -a ]

The determinant is [ (-a)(-a) ) - ( (-i h/(4π)) (i h/(4π)) ) ] = 0.

Calculating each part: (-a)(-a) is a².

The other term: (-i h/(4π)) multiplied by (i h/(4π)) equals [ (-i)(i) * (h²)/(16 π²) ) ].

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i²) which is -(-1) = 1. So that term becomes (h²)/(16 π²) * 1.

So the determinant equation is:

a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0 → a² = h²/(16 π²)

Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π) * (1/2) ?? Wait, wait. Let's compute it properly.

Wait, h²/(16 π²) is (h/(4π))^2. So a² = (h/(4π))² → a = ± h/(4π) * 1? So eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the square root of (h²/(16π²)) is h/(4π), right?

Wait, wait a second. Wait, the equation is a² = (h/(4π))² * (1/ (something?)) No, wait the determinant is a² - [ (h/(4π))² * (i)(-i) ] → Wait, no, let me recalculate the determinant.

Wait, the product of the off-diagonal terms is (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) = (-i * i ) * (h/(4π))².

What's (-i * i)? Hmm, (-i)*i = (-i^2) → because i^2 is -1, so (-i^2) is 1. So it's 1.

So the determinant is a² - (h/(4π))² * (1) = 0 → a² = (h/(4π))² → a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, so the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers. Hmm, but wait, that's interesting because S is a Hermitian matrix? Or not?

Wait, S's matrix: S has 0s on the diagonal, and (0, -i) on first row, (i, 0) on second. Let me check if S is Hermitian. A Hermitian matrix is equal to its conjugate transpose.

Conjugate transpose of S: The (1,2) element becomes (i)* → -i, and (2,1) becomes (-i)* → i.

So S^dagger is:

[ 0, i ]
[ -i, 0 ]

Which is not equal to S, because S's (1,2) element is -i, whereas S^dagger's is i. So they are not the same. So S is not Hermitian. Therefore, Ay being c * S may not be Hermitian either. Oh, but wait, c is a real constant, so if S is not Hermitian, then Ay isn't either. So the eigenvalues could be complex? But in our calculation earlier, the eigenvalues are real.

Wait, but I just did the calculation and found a² = (h/(4π))², so a = ± h/(4π). Wait, but wait, where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the determinant. Let me recompute the determinant. The matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), -a ]

The determinant is (-a)^2 - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ]

= a² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) (h^2)/(16 π²) ) ]

Now, (-i)(i) is (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant is a² - (h^2)/(16 π²) = 0.

Wait, so a² = (h^2)/(16 π^2) → a = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real. That's interesting because if the matrix isn't Hermitian, eigenvalues aren't necessarily real, but in this case, they are. Hmm.

So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B talks about eigenvalues with imaginary parts. Oh, that's different. So perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, another possibility: Did I confuse the matrix S with another form? Let me think. Oh, wait, the matrix S is said to be a 2x2 matrix with first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). Wait, but perhaps S is supposed to be the Pauli Y matrix or something similar. The Pauli Y matrix is:

Y = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

Wait, that's exactly the S matrix in the problem. Oh, so S is the Pauli Y matrix. Wait, but the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Let me check that again.

Wait, S's conjugate transpose would be:

[ 0, i ]
[ -i, 0 ]

Which is not the same as S. So the Pauli Y matrix is actually:

Wait, no, the Pauli Y matrix is:

Y = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Wait, no, wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. The σy matrix is:

σy = [[0, -i],
       [i, 0]]

Which matches the given S matrix. So S is actually the Pauli Y matrix, which is Hermitian. Because the conjugate transpose of σy is equal to σy.

Wait, let me double-check. The Pauli matrices are Hermitian. So S is Hermitian. Therefore, Ay = c * S, with c being a real constant, so Ay is also Hermitian. Therefore, its eigenvalues must be real.

So in my initial calculation, the eigenvalues are real, ±h/(4π). But looking at the options, none of them directly say this.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh or ±–2πh, real parts are ±h/(4π) or ±–h/(4π). That's impossible because if eigenvalues are real, the imaginary part is zero. So A is incorrect.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Also, that would imply complex eigenvalues, which can't be since Ay is Hermitian. So B is wrong.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Well, since A is the angular momentum operator, which has components Ax, Ay, Az. The square of the angular momentum, A², commutes with all components. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's also an eigenfunction of A². But does it commute with Az? Well, unless for spin-1/2 systems, the components don't commute, so their eigenvectors can't be shared. So for example, if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it cannot be an eigenfunction of Az because Ay and Az don't commute. So statement C says that eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That seems correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm, not sure about that. The basis functions would be the eigenfunctions, so perhaps D is correct. Wait, but what's the exact statement? The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Well, the matrix is 2x2, so it acts on a two-dimensional space. The eigenfunctions would form a basis for that space, so D might be correct.

But let's think again. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So which of the options is correct.

Wait, so let's get back to the eigenvalues. Earlier, I thought the eigenvalues were ±h/(4π). But let me think again. Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, right? So S (which is σy) has eigenvalues ±1. Then, Ay = c * S, so c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues of Ay would be ± (h/(4π)) * 1 = ± h/(4π).

So in the options, which option refers to this? Let me check again. 

Option A: Im parts are ±2pi h, which is way larger than h/(4pi). So no.

Option B: Im parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Doesn't match.

Option C: Correct about A² and Az.

Option D: Not sure yet.

Wait, but the question gives the options as statements during the calculation. So which of these statements is correct.

So, looking at option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Well, any matrix has eigenfunctions that form a basis for the vector space. So in a 2x2 matrix, the eigenfunctions (if they form a basis) would span the space. So D is correct.

Wait, but the eigenfunctions of Ay are also the basis functions of the operator. So perhaps that's correct.

But let me think about each option in the context of the problem.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalue and eigenvectors of Ay. So which of the options is a correct statement that would be considered during the calculation.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Well, since A² is the square of the angular momentum, which commutes with all components, any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². But because Ay and Az don't commute, the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So statement C is correct.

So which options are correct? Let's see.

Option C is a correct statement. Option D's correctness depends on what it means by basis functions. The eigenfunctions of Ay form a basis for the vector space, so they are the basis functions for the operator. So D is also a correct statement.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options are multiple-choice, so only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the eigenvalues. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, S is the Pauli Y matrix, which has eigenvalues ±1. So Ay = c S → eigenvalues are c * 1 and c * (-1), which would be c and -c.

Given c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Looking again at the options, perhaps none of them directly mention real eigenvalues. So perhaps I need to look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to find the eigenvalues as ± (h/4π), but the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, let me re-read the problem statement.

The operator is Ay = c * S, where c = h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix given as first row [0, -i], second row [i, 0].

Wait, perhaps I should compute the eigenvalues in terms of S, then apply the scaling by c.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the eigenvalues of S first, then multiply by c.

Yes, that's probably a better approach.

The matrix S is the Pauli Y matrix, which has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So the eigenvalues of Ay would be c * (+1) and c * (-1), which are c and -c. So that's h/(4π) and -h/(4pi).

Now, looking at the options, which one aligns with this.

Looking at option B: the eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. That's not matching what I found.

Option A suggests that the eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh, which is way bigger than h/(4pi).

Wait, perhaps I confused h with ħ. Oh, wait, h is Planck's constant, but in quantum mechanics, the reduced Planck constant is ħ = h/(2π). So maybe in this problem, they used h, not ħ.

Wait, but the problem says c = h/(4π), so that's h over four pi.

Hmm, perhaps the eigenvalues are ± (ħ/2), but with ħ being h/(2pi), so ħ/2 is h/(4pi). Which matches the eigenvalues I found.

Wait, but the problem's options are in terms of h, not ħ.

So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), which are real.

So looking back at the options, which option is correct.

Only option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. That is correct because A² commutes with each component, so any eigenstate of a component is an eigenstate of A². But for two different components, like Ay and Az, their eigenstates are not the same because they don't commute.

So statement C is correct.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That is also correct because any Hermitian operator's eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space. So D is correct.

Wait, but I can only choose one option. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But looking at the options, which one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, which is the basis for the matrix operator.

But I'm a bit confused. Let's think about each option.

Option C is correct because eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Option D: eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. That's correct because any Hermitian operator's eigenvectors (if they are non-degenerate) form a basis. Since Ay is 2x2 and has two distinct eigenvalues, its eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option D says: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. I think this is correct because any operator's eigenfunctions can form a basis. So both C and D could be correct, but I can only choose one.

Wait, but the options are presented as statements, and the question is which is correct during the calculation.

Wait, perhaps in the calculation, we find that the eigenvalues are real, which would make statements about them having imaginary parts incorrect. So options A and B can be ruled out.

So between C and D.

But let's think again. The question is which statement will be considered correct during the calculation.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. So during calculation, you might realize that eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That's a true statement, but perhaps it's more of a general statement rather than specific to the calculation.

But the question is about statements considered during the calculation, perhaps about the properties of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C or D.

But let me think about the eigenvalue calculation again. Since the eigenvalues are real, all options that suggest complex eigenvalues are out. So only C and D are possible.

If I'm to choose between them, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, the answer options are:

A) Im parts ±2πh, Re parts ±h/(4π). No, eigenvalues are real.

B) Im parts ±1/2, Re parts ±1. No, eigenvalues are real.

C) Eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Yes, correct.

D) Eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Also correct.

Hmm, but the options are presented as statements to consider. So if the calculation shows that the eigenvalues are real, then options A and B are incorrect. So which of C or D is correct.

But the problem says which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps when solving the problem, you would realize that the eigenfunctions form a basis, making D correct. Alternatively, you might realize that the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not Az, making C correct.

I think statement C is correct because it's a property of angular momentum operators. The square of the angular momentum commutes with each component, so any eigenstate of a component is also an eigenstate of the square, but not of the other components.

So the correct answer is C.

The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix given as:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix, which is Hermitian and has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \).
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are scaled by \( c \), resulting in eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - These eigenvalues are real, as \( A_y \) is Hermitian.

2. **Option Analysis:**
   - **Option A:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are entirely real, with no imaginary parts.
   - **Option B:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real and do not match the given values.
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with all components of \( A \), making \( A^2 \) share eigenfunctions with \( A_y \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).
   - **Option D:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While this is generally true for Hermitian operators, it is a more general statement and less directly tied to the specific calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors in this problem.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Options A and B are incorrect due to their claims about complex eigenvalues, which do not match the real eigenvalues of \( A_y \).
   - Option D is correct but is a general statement about Hermitian operators and not specific to the calculation of \( A_y \).
   - Option C is the most relevant and correct statement during the calculation, as it highlights a key property of angular momentum operators and their eigenfunctions.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
