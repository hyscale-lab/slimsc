Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution from my studies. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level as those in star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38 x 10^-23 J. Both photospheres are in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies. So, I should probably use the Boltzmann equation here.

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution formula is (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). Oh right, because the ratio of the populations of two energy states depends on their statistical weights and the exponential of the energy difference over kT.

In this case, I think the specific energy level is the excited state. So, for star_1, the excitation is higher. Let's define the energy levels: let's say E_1 is the excited state and E_2 is the lower state. So the energy difference ΔE is E_1 - E_2 = 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, but the problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So the ratio n1/n2 (excited to lower) for star_1 is 2. For star_2, the ratio is 1, perhaps? Wait, no. Wait, no, because if star_1 has twice as many excited in that level, then n1 (excited) / n2 (ground) = 2. For star_2, it's something else. Wait, no—wait, wait.

Wait, the problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited compared to star_2. So, for the same energy level, let's say the excited state, the number density in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Wait, or is it that the excitation in star_1 is twice the excitation in star_2. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, maybe the number of atoms in that specific excited state in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. So, n1_1 / n1_2 = 2? Or wait, perhaps the ratio is (n1_1)/(n1_2) = 2, where n is the population of the excited state in each star, assuming the ground state is the same? Or perhaps it's that the ratio is 2 for star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as n1 (excited) / n1 (ground) = 2, and n2 (excited)/n2 (ground) = some other value. But no, the problem says star_1 has twice as much excitation as star_2, so maybe the ratio for star_1 is 2 times the ratio for star_2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to structure this.

Let me denote the excited state as level i and the ground as j. So, the ratio for each star is (n_i / n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), assuming ΔE is E_i - E_j.

But wait, since the problem doesn't mention anything about the statistical weights (g_i and g_j), I think we can assume they're the same for both stars, so the ratio simplifies to exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ) for each star.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the specific energy levels have an energy difference of 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE is 1.38e-23 J.

So, for star_1, the ratio (n1_i / n1_j) = exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) )

Similarly, for star_2, (n2_i / n2_j ) = exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) )

But according to the problem, the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Wait, is that the ratio of n_i to n_j or the absolute number of excited atoms? I think it's the ratio. So, (n1_i / n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j )

Wait, that can't be right because the problem says star_1's atoms are twice as excited. Maybe it's that the number in the excited state for star_1 is twice that in star_2. But that would depend on the total number of atoms as well, which complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps it's the ratio of excited to ground that's twice as much in star_1 as in star_2.

Wait, the problem states: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, I think it's that the ratio of excited to ground is twice as high in star_1. So, (n1_i/n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i/n2_j )

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is twice as much in star_1, meaning the ratio (n1_i/n1_j) is twice (n2_i/n2_j). Wait, but that would complicate things because the temperatures would affect the exponential.

Wait another approach: the ratio of the excitation in the two stars is 2. So, (n1_i/n1_j)/(n2_i/n2_j) ) = 2.

So, [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = 2?

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is higher in star_1, so the ratio (n_i/n_j) is larger. Let me think: the higher the temperature, the more population in the excited state. So, star_1 has a higher temperature than star_2, which would make (n_i/n_j) for star_1 larger than star_2.

But the problem says that the excitation is twice as much. So, that ratio is 2.

Wait, so (n1_i / n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j )

But (n_i/n_j) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] = 2 * [exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Take natural log on both sides: (-ΔE/(k T1 )) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2)) )

Wait, let me write that out:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Multiply both sides by -k:

ΔE/(T1) ) = - ln(2) + ΔE/(T2 )

Rearranging:

ΔE/(T1) - ΔE/(T2) = - ln(2 )

Factor ΔE:

ΔE [ 1/T1 - 1/T2 ] = - ln(2 )

Hmm, but I'm not sure about the signs. Let me recheck the algebra.

Wait, original equation after taking logs:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Multiply both sides by -k:

ΔE/(T1) ) = -k ln(2 ) + ΔE/( T2 )

So, ΔE/(T1) - ΔE/(T2) = -k ln(2 )

Wait, that's a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently.

Wait, another approach: Let's model the ratio (n_i/n_j) for star_1 as being twice that of star_2.

So:

(n_i/n_j)_1 = 2 * (n_i/n_j)_2

Which is:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take natural log of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) ) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2) )

Rearrange:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2 )

Hmm, that's better. Let me write this as:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ) ) ) = ln(2 )

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So, substituting:

(ΔE / k ) * ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

Hmm, but I don't know the value of k or ΔE, but wait, the problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, I know that k (Boltzmann's constant) is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, that's exactly the same number!

So, ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE = k * T_0, where T_0 is 1 K, because 1.38e-23 J = 1.38e-23 J/K * 1 K.

Wait, so substituting that into the equation:

( (k T_0 ) / k ) * ( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

Simplify (k cancels):

T_0 * ( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

But T0 is 1 K, so:

( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

Hmm, which can be written as:

ln(2 ) = ( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 )

Which of the options matches this?

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ). Which matches.

Wait, but let me check. The options are:

A) ln(2)= T2/T1

B) ln(2)= (T1 + T2 )/(T1 T2 )

C) ln(2)= (T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 )^2 )

D) ln(2)= (T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 )

So, yes, option D matches.

Wait, but I thought the star_1 has higher temperature than star_2 because it's more excited. So, T1 > T2, so T1 - T2 is positive, and the right side is positive, which makes sense as ln(2) is positive. So that seems correct.

So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (star_1 and star_2) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann distribution is used to relate the excitation levels to the temperatures. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and Boltzmann's constant is \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \).

The excitation ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2, meaning:

\[
\frac{n_{1,i}}{n_{1,j}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2,i}}{n_{2,j}}
\]

Using the Boltzmann distribution:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right)
\]

For star_1 and star_2, this becomes:

\[
\frac{n_{1,i}}{n_{1,j}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right), \quad \frac{n_{2,i}}{n_{2,j}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right)
\]

Substituting the excitation ratio:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right)
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2} = -\ln(2)
\]

Factoring out \( \Delta E \) and \( k \):

\[
\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = -\ln(2)
\]

Simplifying \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) to \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = -\ln(2)
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \cdot 1 \, \text{K} \) (as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)):

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2)
\]

This matches the form of option D:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

Thus, the correct equation for the effective temperatures is:

**Answer: D**
