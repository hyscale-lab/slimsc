Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the product after a reaction. Let's think through this step by step.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically involved in the hydrolysis of certain groups. Oh wait, more specifically, in the case of a benzoyl chloride or some kind of acyl chloride, right? Because when an acyl chloride reacts with HI in the presence of phosphorus, it might undergo some kind of substitution or hydrolysis.

But wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh right, red phosphorus and HI are commonly used for the hydrolysis of nitriles. Alternatively, sometimes they are used for the conversion of acid chlorides to carboxylic acids. Wait, another possibility: maybe it's the hydrolysis of an ester? No, I think esters usually need more acidic conditions or different catalysts. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction where a leaving group is replaced.

Let me look at the spectral data given for Compound X. The IR and NMR data should tell me about the structure of X, which is essential to determine the reaction product.

First, the IR data: peaks at 3400–2500 cm^-1. That broad region suggests an O-H stretch, maybe from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a very strong O-H stretch around 2500-3500, often a broad peak. The 1720 cm^-1 peak is indicative of a carbonyl group, like in a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But wait, a carboxylic acid has a carbonyl around 1700 and an O-H stretch. Also, the 1610 and 1450 cm^-1 peaks look like they might be aromatic C=C stretches. So, the compound probably has an aromatic ring with some substituents, a carbonyl group, and possibly an O-H group.

Now the NMR. Let's look at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a pretty downfield shift. Could be an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10. Or maybe a phenolic O-H, but those are often broader. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be around 10-12, which matches this. Or maybe an acidic proton like an enol if there's conjugation, but less likely. Hmm.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical aromatic protons. The doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene. So, if the substituents are in the para positions, each set of two protons would be a doublet. So the molecule has a para-substituted benzene ring.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet in the 2.9 region. That might be a CH adjacent to an electronegative group, maybe a carbonyl. Or perhaps a methylene group in a branched chain.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet. Maybe this is a CH2 group that's adjacent to another CH or something else. Maybe it's part of a chain connected to the aromatic ring.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of 3H as a doublet. That suggests a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH or a quaternary carbon. Like in an isopropyl group or a CH(CH3)2 situation.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet with 3H, which is likely a terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain. So maybe a CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together, the aromatic ring has two substituents in the para positions. Let's think about what they might be. One substituent is probably a carbonyl group, given the IR data. So maybe the ring is substituted with a carbonyl-containing group and another group.

Looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm could be a carboxylic acid proton. But wait, another thought: the IR has a 1720 cm^-1 peak, which is a strong carbonyl. If the compound is a benzoic acid derivative, the carbonyl would be at around 1700. But wait, 1720 is a bit higher, which might suggest an ester or ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid, but the carbonyl could also be from another group.

Wait another point: the 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, which is typical of a carboxylic acid proton. So if that's the case, the compound would have a COOH group attached to the benzene ring. But then, the 1720 cm^-1 in IR would fit a carboxylic acid (like around 1700), but sometimes it can be a bit higher if conjugated or in certain environments.

Wait, but wait. The IR also shows peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm^-1. Those are indicative of aromatic C=C stretching. The 1610 is probably the ring's stretching. So the aromatic ring is present, and it has substituents.

So, for the aromatic ring, let's think of 4-substituted benzene. What substituents? One substituent could be a carbonyl group, like a COOR or COOH. The other substituent would be a chain with branching.

Looking at the NMR shifts:

- The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would be a CH group. If it's attached to a carbonyl, like a ketone, that could make sense. Or maybe it's part of an isopropyl group.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H. That's a methyl group attached to something. Like in an isopropyl group, where the methyl is attached to a CH. So perhaps there's a CH(CH3) group adjacent to something else.

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a CH2CH3 group somewhere. So maybe the substituent is a chain like CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, that's butyl. Alternatively, maybe a longer chain with an ethyl group.

Wait, putting it all together, maybe the substituents on the benzene are a COOH group and a branched chain. Let's consider the options given. The options are all benzoic acid derivatives or substituted benzenes.

Let me look at the options:

Option A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Wait, no, that would be a phenylpropanoic acid, but I'm not sure. Wait, the structure is more about the substitution.

Option C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position. So the benzene ring has a COOH group and a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group? Wait, no. Wait, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Or wait, maybe it's CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)? Wait, no. Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2? No, wait. Wait, butyl groups: n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH2-, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but maybe I'm getting that wrong. Wait, no: iso-butyl is (CH3)2CHCH2- as the substituent. Wait, wait a minute. Let me clarify.

Butyl groups can be:

n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2-

iso-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. No, wait, iso-butyl is (CH3)2CHCH2- as the substituent when attached. Wait, no. Wait, the iso-butyl group is actually CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it.

Wait, the substituent in option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene ring has a COOH group in position 1 and a sec-butyl group in position 4. So the substituents would be at para positions.

So, the substituent on the benzene is a -COOH and a -CH2CH2CH(CH3)- ?

Wait, no, wait. The structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, butyl groups:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2-

- iso-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)CH2- (but that's not correct; iso-butyl is actually (CH2)2CHCH2- ? No, wait, iso-butyl is (CH3)2CHCH2-.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the substituent as a CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group. So, the structure would be:

The benzene ring with COOH in position 4, and a substituent that's a sec-butyl group. So the substituent chain is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-?

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the substituent as a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. So the substituent is a tertiary butyl group? Or maybe not.

Now, looking at the NMR data: the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would be a CH group. If the substituent is a sec-butyl, which is -CH2CH(CH2CH3), then perhaps the CH group would be the central CH in the isopropyl-like structure.

Wait, but in a sec-butyl group, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So in the substituent, it's attached like:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)

Wait, no. Wait, the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps it's -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So for example, a substituent like CH2CH(CH3)2? No, that's more like an iso-propyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl chain with a branch, like CH2CH(CH3)CH2-, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). That would make it a butyl group, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, let's consider the NMR data and see if it fits the possible substituent.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH group. Let's say that's connected to a carbonyl group, like in a ketone. Or perhaps it's a CH adjacent to an oxygen.

Wait, looking back, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which suggests a carbonyl group. So if the compound has a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester, then maybe the substituent on the benzene is a carbonyl-containing group.

Wait, but in option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl and the other substituent is a COOH. So the benzene has COOH and a sec-butyl group in para positions.

So, let's think about the NMR. The peak at 2.9 ppm (1H, m) would be the CH in the sec-butyl group. Because the sec-butyl is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3), right? Wait, no. Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. So, the substituent is a butyl group where the branching is in the middle.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let me think.

In any case, the substituent has a CH group, which would be split into a multiplet. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be the neighboring CH2 groups.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be a methyl group attached to a CH. So, if the substituent is CH(CH3)-CH2-..., then the methyl would show up as a doublet.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the ring. So, the substituent would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3), but that might not fit.

Alternatively, let's think about the structure implied by the NMR shifts.

The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) suggests a terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain. So perhaps there's an ethyl group attached to another CH2 or CH group.

So, putting it all together, the substituent attached to the benzene ring is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, maybe it's -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the ring.

Wait, but that would be a pentyl group, perhaps. Or if it's -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, that might be a butyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, like in an iso-propyl group.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH. So, if it's a CH(CH3), then the splitting would be a doublet because the CH is adjacent to a CH2 group, perhaps.

So, the substituent would be something like CH2-CH(CH3)-.

Wait, but let's look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, the substituent would be a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring. So, the structure would be:

Ph-COOH and Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, no, the substituent is the sec-butyl group. So, the substituent would be -(CH2)2CH(CH3)? Not exactly.

Wait, the correct structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, wait, that's not correct. Wait, the sec-butyl group is actually -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. No, that can't be right.

Wait, butyl groups: the substituent is a four-carbon chain. For sec-butyl, it's -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, that would be a four-carbon chain where the substituent is attached to the second carbon.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure, but let's think about the NMR.

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then the structure is:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-

Wait, but no, that would make it a butyl group attached as -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Let's think about the NMR.

The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) would be the CH in the middle of the substituent. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) would be the adjacent CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would be a methyl attached to a CH, which would be the terminal CH3 in a methyl group attached to a CH.

Wait, but in a sec-butyl group, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So, the substituent is two carbons from the ring. The first carbon is CH2, the second is CH attached to another CH2CH3 group.

So, the substituent is Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

So, looking at the NMR:

The CH2 connected to the ring would have protons that are perhaps around 1.7 ppm as a multiplet. The CH in the middle would be at 2.9 ppm, as it's a CH with neighboring groups. The CH2CH3 at the end would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm.

Wait, but the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3), so the CH2 at the end is CH2CH3.

So the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) would be the CH2CH3 group at the end. The CH in the middle (CH) would be at 2.9 ppm. The adjacent CH2 (from the ring's CH2) would be at 1.7 ppm. The CH2CH3 in the substituent would be at 0.9 ppm.

The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would be the CH(CH3) group, but wait, in this case, the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3), so the CH has a CH2CH3 group attached. Wait, but that would not have a methyl attached to it. So perhaps this isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of the substituent structure again.

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, the structure is:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the substituent would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3) as a substituent. So, the substituent is two carbons in length, with the CH2 group attached to the benzene, and the next carbon is CH attached to a CH2CH3 group.

Wait, that would make the substituent a three-carbon group, but wait, a butyl group is four carbons. Hmm, now I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let's think about that.

If the substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-, that might give some NMR signals. The CH(CH3) would be in the 2.9 ppm region. The adjacent CH2 groups would be around 1.7 ppm. The terminal CH2CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm.

Wait, but in that case, the substituent would be a iso-butyl group (CH2CH(CH3)2?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the substituent as a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. So, the substituent is -(CH2)2CH(CH3). That would make it a pentyl group? Or perhaps a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, but the substituent is on the benzene ring, so the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-.

But that would make it a pentyl group, which doesn't fit the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's go back to the reaction.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. So, I thought it's a hydrolysis reaction. For example, if X is an acyl chloride, it would react with HI to form a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, if X is a nitrile, it would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the IR has a 1720 cm^-1 peak, which could be an acid chloride (around 1800? Wait, no, acid chlorides are around 1800, esters around 1740-1720. So, 1720 is more in line with an ester or maybe an aldehyde. Wait, no, aldehyde's are around 2820 and 2720 for the aldehyde C-H stretches, which I don't see here.

Wait, the IR also has a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So, if it's an ester, then the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would likely not change it, unless it's a specific reaction. Alternatively, if it's an acid chloride, then hydrolysis would give a carboxylic acid. But then, the 10.5 ppm peak in the NMR is a broad singlet, which is a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid proton.

Wait, but then if X is a benzoyl chloride, upon hydrolysis with HI and red P, it would form benzoic acid. But looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, if X is the acid chloride, and the substituents are a COCl and a sec-butyl group on the benzene, then hydrolysis would give the benzoic acid.

But wait, the NMR of X would have a carbonyl as COCl, which would have a different IR. Oh, right, in the IR, an acid chloride (COCl) has a strong peak around 1800 cm^-1. But in this case, the IR peak is at 1720, which suggests more of an ester or a ketone.

Wait, another thought: maybe X is an ester. So, if X is an ester, then reaction with HI and red phosphorus might not do much unless it's a specific ester. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Another angle: the NMR of X has a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which could be a carboxylic acid, but if that's the case, perhaps X is a benzoic acid derivative. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 ppm peak is an aldehyde. Aldehydes typically have a singlet around 9-10 ppm. But the broadness suggests it's more likely an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.

Wait, but if X is an ester, then the NMR would have a carbonyl (1720 cm^-1), and perhaps the O-R group. But the NMR doesn't show any triplet around 4 ppm, which is typical for an OCH2 group in an ester. So perhaps it's not an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a ketone. The 1720 would fit that. Then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI—what would that do? I think I'm more familiar with that reaction in the context of nitriles and acid chlorides.

Wait, another possibility: the IR has a peak at 1720 cm^-1 and a 3400-2500 region. Could there be an alcohol group and a carbonyl group? But then, the NMR would have an O-H peak, which would be a broad peak. In the NMR data given, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which fits a carboxylic acid.

So, putting it together, X has a benzene ring with a COOH group and another substituent, which is a sec-butyl group. So, it's 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But wait, that would already be the product. If X is the acid, then what's the reaction?

Wait, no. Because the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. If X is the acid, then the reaction might not proceed as nothing is present to react. So perhaps X is a nitrile or an acid chloride.

Wait, another possibility: X is a nitrile. The IR doesn't show the nitrile peak (~2200 cm^-1), so that's probably not the case.

Wait, another thought: maybe the IR peak at 1720 is from a ketone. So, X is a ketone with a benzene ring, a substituent, and maybe an alcohol group.

But then, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus. Wait, I'm not sure about the reaction conditions for a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a propargyl chloride or another compound.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the NMR.

The aromatic region: two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene. So, two substituents in para positions.

So, the substituents are a COOH group and another group, which is a sec-butyl group.

So, the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

But wait, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. So, what would happen to an acid like that?

Wait, if X is a benzoyl chloride (like PhCOCl), then reaction with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze it to PhCOOH. But in that case, the initial compound X would have a COCl group, which would have a higher wavenumber in IR (~1800 cm^-1). But the IR here is 1720, which is lower, more like an ester or a ketone.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where an acyl group is replaced by an iodide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: X is an acid chloride, and the reaction converts it into an acid. So, for example, if X is benzoyl chloride, then the product would be benzoic acid. But in this case, the product would be benzoic acid with substituents.

But wait, in the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride, then the reaction would produce the benzoic acid, which is option C.

But looking at the NMR data for X, if it's a chloride, then the NMR would show signals that don't fit. For example, the 10.5 ppm would be a COOH, but if X is the chloride, then the 10.5 would be a different proton.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Perhaps I should approach this by considering each option and see which one makes sense.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So, the structure would be CH2CH2COOH attached to a benzene ring that's ethyl-substituted.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a substituted toluene with an isobutyl group and a methyl.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, para-substituted benzoic acid with a sec-butyl.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Another substituted toluene.

The reaction is X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. So, what's the structure of X?

If X is an acyl chloride, then the product would be the acid. So, for example, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride, then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

But what does X's NMR look like in that case? If X is the acyl chloride, the NMR would have a carbonyl chloride peak, but that's not in the data given. Wait, the IR data for X is 1720 cm^-1, which is lower than the typical 1800 for acid chlorides. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, if X is a nitrile, then the product would be a carboxylic acid after hydrolysis. So, for example, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile, then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But the IR data for a nitrile would have a peak around 2200 cm^-1, which isn't present here. So that's probably not it.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze it to the acid. But then, the ester's IR would have a peak around 1720, which fits. Let's see.

If X is an ester, like 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate ester (e.g., methyl benzoate), then the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze it to the acid. So, the product would be option C.

But wait, the NMR of X would have the ester group, with the O-R group. But in the given NMR, there's a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which suggests an ethyl group. So perhaps the ester is an ethyl ester.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data, the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) could be the ethyl group in the ester's OR group. So, if X is ethyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, then the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze it to 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

But wait, in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a singlet. In an ester, the carbonyl is at 1720, which is the case here. But the OCH2CH3 group would appear as a quartet around 4 ppm, but that's not observed in the given NMR data. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, unless the ester is not an ethyl ester. Maybe it's a methyl ester or another type. But the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which fits a terminal CH2CH3, like in an ethyl group.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

The reaction conditions are red phosphorus and HI. This is a classic condition for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. Alternatively, for acid chlorides to carboxylic acids.

Given that, perhaps X is a nitrile or an acid chloride, and the product is the corresponding acid.

But in the NMR, if X is a nitrile, then the peak at 10.5 ppm would not be a nitrile; nitriles don't have a proton there. Wait, no. Nitriles don't have protons attached, so the 10.5 ppm would be something else.

Alternatively, if X is an acid chloride, then the NMR wouldn't have a 10.5 ppm peak because it's not a carboxylic acid yet. So perhaps X is a benzoyl chloride derivative.

Wait, but the IR for X shows 1720, which is a bit low for an acid chloride. Typically, acid chloride carbonyls are around 1800 cm^-1. So that's confusing.

Wait, another possibility: the 1720 cm^-1 is from an ester. So, X is an ester. The reaction conditions would hydrolyze the ester to a carboxylic acid.

So, if X is ethyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But the NMR would have a triplet at around 4 ppm for the OCH2CH3 group, which is not present in the data provided. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is a methyl ester. But then, the OCH3 would appear as a singlet around 3.8 ppm, which isn't in the given data.

Wait, but in the given NMR data, there's no signal in the 3-4 ppm range, which suggests that there are no OCH2 or OCH3 groups. So perhaps X is not an ester.

Another thought: maybe X is a ketone. The 1720 is a ketone, and the reaction with HI and red phosphorus might not do anything. But the reaction conditions don't seem to fit a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, replacing a leaving group with iodide. So, perhaps X has a leaving group that is replaced by iodide.

Wait, but the product options don't include any iodides. So that's probably not the case.

Hmm. Let's think again about the NMR data. The aromatic protons are in two doublets: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That's a classic para-substituted benzene. So, two substituents in para positions.

The substituents are a carbonyl-containing group (from IR) and another group. The 10.5 ppm peak suggests a COOH group.

So, X has a benzene ring with a COOH and another group in para positions.

The other group's NMR signals are:

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): a CH group

- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): a CH2 group

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): a CH3 group attached to a CH

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): a CH2CH3 group

So, the substituent is a chain like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Alternatively, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, if the substituent is -(CH2)2CH(CH3), then the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-.

But let's look at the NMR:

The CH(CH3) would be at 2.9 ppm (1H, m).

The adjacent CH2 groups would be at 1.7 ppm (2H, m).

The terminal CH2CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (3H, t).

The methyl group on the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (3H, d).

Wait, that makes sense. So, the substituent would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's longer than what's needed.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, let's break it down:

The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait no, that would be a three-carbon substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with a branch, like iso-butyl.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to imagine the substituent.

The substituent attached to the benzene is a group that has a CH group (2.9 ppm), adjacent to a CH2 (1.7 ppm), which is adjacent to a CH(CH3) (1.4 ppm), and then a CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm).

Wait, that would make the substituent Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3? No, that's too long.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is Ph-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH3. But then the signals wouldn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl chain with a methyl branch, like Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, but that would give a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is Ph-CH(CH2CH2CH3).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about option C.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

So, what would the NMR look like for a sec-butyl group?

A sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

So, the substituent would be attached as Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, but that's a three-carbon substituent. Then, the structure would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

So, the substituent is -(CH2)2CH(CH3)-?

No, perhaps it's better to draw the substituent.

Sec-butyl group: the substituent is attached to the benzene at the second carbon of a butyl chain.

So, the structure would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but that's a three-carbon chain, which would make it a propyl group with a branch, which would be a iso-propyl group. Hmm.

In any case, the NMR would show:

- The CH in the middle (CH(CH2CH3)) at around 2.9 ppm.

- The adjacent CH2 (from the benzene) at around 1.7 ppm.

- The methyl groups (CH2CH3) at 0.9 ppm.

The CH(CH2CH3) would have a methyl group attached, but that's not the case here. So, perhaps the substituent is a iso-propyl group with another substituent.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the integration of the NMR peaks.

The aromatic protons are 2H each, so that's four H in total. The other peaks: 1H (at 10.5), 1H (2.9), 2H (1.7), 3H (1.4), 3H (0.9). Total H: 1 + 2 + 1 +3 +3=10 H. So molecular formula would be C9H10O2 perhaps, if it's a benzoic acid with substituents.

Wait, benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding a substituent with C4H9 would make it C11H12O2? No, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

But regardless, perhaps the structure of X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would not change it, because it's already the acid. But the question states that X reacts to form a product, so X can't be the acid.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzoyl chloride. So, the structure would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride. Then, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze it to the acid, which is option C.

In that case, X's NMR would not have a 10.5 ppm peak, because it's a chloride, not an acid. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe X is a nitrile. So, the structure would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile. Then, the reaction would hydrolyze it to the acid.

But the IR would show a nitrile peak around 2200 cm^-1, which isn't present. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to the acid.

So, if X is ethyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

In the NMR of X, the ester group would have OCH2CH3, which would appear as a quartet around 4 ppm. But the given NMR doesn't show such a peak. So that's probably not the case.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps X has an acetal group or something else. Or maybe the reaction is a Grignard reaction, but that doesn't fit the conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a leaving group is replaced by iodide. But the product options don't include iodide, so perhaps that's not it.

Wait, going back. Let me consider each option's structure.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

If X is this compound, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI wouldn't change it. So that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps X is an acyl bromide. Then, the reaction would produce the acid. But in that case, the IR would show a peak around 1800 cm^-1, which isn't the case here.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try another approach.

The IR shows 1720 cm^-1, which is a carbonyl. The 3400-2500 region suggests an O-H, perhaps from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.

In the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, 1H. That's a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid.

So, the compound X has a carboxylic acid group. So, X is a benzoic acid derivative.

Then, the reaction is X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. But why would that reaction occur if X is already a carboxylic acid? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe X is not the acid but something else that would form the acid upon reaction.

Wait, perhaps X is a nitrile. So, the reaction would produce a carboxylic acid. But the IR doesn't show a nitrile peak.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, which would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. But as before, the NMR doesn't fit that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a ketone with a leaving group, and the reaction is a nucleophilic addition or substitution. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction. Wait, red phosphorus and HI are sometimes used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. But the Clemmensen typically uses Zn(Hg)/HCl. Alternatively, the presence of red phosphorus and HI could be for a different reaction.

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think about the reaction again.

Red phosphorus and HI: the reaction conditions are often used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. For example, RCN + HI, P → RCOOH.

If X is a nitrile, then the product is the acid. But the IR of X doesn't show the nitrile peak. So that's probably not the case.

Wait, but the IR of X shows a 1720 cm^-1, which is a carbonyl. So, perhaps X is a carboxylic acid already.

But why would a carboxylic acid react with red phosphorus and HI? That doesn't make sense. So perhaps X is not the acid.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an acyl chloride, and the reaction is hydrolysis.

But as I thought before, the IR of X should have a carbonyl at higher wavenumber if it's an acyl chloride.

Wait, perhaps X is an ester with a bromide or another leaving group. But I don't see any evidence of that in the NMR.

I'm stuck, so perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the information.

The NMR data suggests a para-substituted benzene, a COOH group, and a substituent with a CH, CH2, and CH2CH3 groups. That fits a sec-butyl group.

The IR suggests a carbonyl group, which would be the COOH.

So, the compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But then, what reaction would it undergo with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, unless X is a different compound that becomes the acid upon reaction. But I can't think of any other functional groups that would fit the IR and NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzamide, but that's a stretch. I don't see evidence of an amide in the data.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent. The IR would show the aldehyde peak around 2820 and 2720, but those aren't present. So that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe X is a ketone, and the reaction is a substitution. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider the options again.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: that's a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group.

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: that's a toluene derivative with an isobutyl and a methyl group.

C)4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

D)1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. So, the product would be if X is a nitrile, acid chloride, or ester. Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl halide and the reaction is a substitution.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Another approach: think about the product options.

Option C is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl substituent. If X is the corresponding chloride or an ester, the reaction would produce this.

But looking at the reaction conditions, perhaps X is an acid chloride.

So, X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride.

IR of X would have a strong carbonyl around 1800 cm^-1, but the given IR is 1720. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, X is an ester with a substituent that, upon hydrolysis, becomes the acid.

But the NMR doesn't show the ester oxygen. So that's not matching.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps X is a benzene ring with a ketone group and a substituent, and the reaction is a reduction. But I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, replacing a leaving group with iodide.

But the product options don't have iodide, so that's not it.

Hmm.

Given all this, I think the correct product is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Because the IR and NMR data of X suggest a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl substituent, and the reaction conditions could be for hydrolysis, but perhaps X is an ester that becomes the acid.

Wait, but earlier I thought the NMR didn't fit an ester, but perhaps I was wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not a hydrolysis but a different one. Maybe the reaction is a substitution where a leaving group is replaced by an iodide, but again, the product options don't include iodide.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a benzoin condensation? No, I don't think so.

Another angle: The 10.5 ppm peak in the NMR is a broad singlet, which is a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid. So X is a benzoic acid derivative.

The IR at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a conjugated carbonyl, perhaps.

So, the reaction must be something that occurs on the substituent. If X is a benzoic acid with a substituent that can undergo substitution, perhaps the reaction replaces a leaving group with iodide.

Wait, but the product options don't have iodide.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitrile group, and the reaction is hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid, but the IR doesn't show the nitrile.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ketone, and the reaction reduces it. But I don't see how.

Hmm. I think I've gone as far as I can. I'll go with option C as the product.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the IR and NMR data of Compound X to deduce its structure.

### Key Observations:
1. **IR Data**:
   - A strong carbonyl peak at **1720 cm⁻¹**, suggesting the presence of a carbonyl group.
   - A broad IR region between **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**, indicative of an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
   - Peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹**, consistent with aromatic C=C stretching.

2. **NMR Data**:
   - **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton.
   - **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a **para-substituted benzene ring**.
   - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet, likely corresponding to a CH group.
   - **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet, likely from a CH₂ group.
   - **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet, indicative of a methyl group attached to a CH.
   - **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet, corresponding to a terminal CH₃ group in an ethyl chain.

### Structural Analysis:
- The **para-substituted benzene ring** suggests two substituents in the para positions.
- The **10.5 ppm peak** and the IR data strongly indicate the presence of a **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) on the benzene ring.
- The remaining substituent is a **branched alkyl chain**. The NMR signals at **2.9 ppm (1H)**, **1.7 ppm (2H)**, **1.4 ppm (3H)**, and **0.9 ppm (3H)** correspond to a **sec-butyl group** (-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃).

Thus, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Reaction Analysis:
The reaction involves red phosphorus and HI, which are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles or acid chlorides to carboxylic acids. However, since Compound X is already a carboxylic acid, the reaction conditions do not alter its structure. Therefore, the product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: Incorrect. The structure does not match the NMR and IR data.
- **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect. This structure lacks a carboxylic acid group and does not fit the spectral data.
- **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: Correct. This matches the para-substituted benzene, the carboxylic acid group, and the sec-butyl substituent.
- **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect. This structure lacks a carboxylic acid group and does not fit the spectral data.

### Conclusion:
The final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
