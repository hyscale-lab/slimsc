Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question gives a Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. Right, so σ matrices are antisymmetric and involve the gamma matrices.

I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable. The options are A to D, each with a different combination.

First, I remember that in quantum field theory, each term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension of 4 because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ=c=1). So each term in the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 since it's integrated over four spacetime dimensions.

So each term in the Lagrangian should have [L] = 4. Let's break down the given Lagrangian term: κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ, ψ, and F.

Let me recall the mass dimensions of the fields involved. I think the Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because, for example, the kinetic term for ψ is i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which has dimensions [ψ̄][ψ][∂] = [ψ]^2 [mass]^1. The term must have dimension 4, so 3/2 * 2 (since ψ̄ is the adjoint, same dimension as ψ) plus 1 (from the derivative) equals 4. So yes, [ψ] = 3/2.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, right? F is the derivative of the gauge field A. The gauge field A has mass dimension 1 because the Maxwell term is like F^2, which must have dimension 4. So F^{μν} has dimension [∂ A] = [mass]^1 [A]^1 = 1+1=2.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, F^{μν} is ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ. Each A has dimension 1, and derivative adds 1, so F has dimension 2.

Now, what about the σ_{μν} term? σ is (i/2)[γ_mu, gamma_nu]. The gamma matrices are dimensionless (since they're part of the spinor representation, and don't carry mass dimensions). So σ_{mu nu} is constructed from gammas and is dimensionless as well. So each σ is dimensionless.

So now, let's look at the Lagrangian term: κ * ψ̄ * σ_{μν} * ψ * F^{μν}.

Breaking down each part's dimension:

κ is the coupling constant we're trying to find. ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, ψ also 3/2. F has dimension 2. σ is dimensionless, so it doesn't affect the dimension.

So putting it all together: [κ] = [L] - [ψ̄] - [ψ] - [F]. Because when you multiply terms, their dimensions add, and the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4 to have [L] =4.

Wait, no. Wait, the entire term is κ * (ψ̄ σ ψ) * F. So the term is [κ] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [F] because each part is multiplied. But wait, σ is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, so no contribution there. So the dimensions are [κ] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [F] should be equal to 4.

Wait, let me think again.

The term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. So each of these factors contributes their own dimensions:

[κ] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [F] = 4.

Because L_int has dimension 4.

So substituting the known dimensions:

[κ] + (3/2) + (3/2) + (2) =4.

Adding 3/2 +3/2 is 3. 3 + 2 is 5. So [κ] +5=4. So [κ] =4-5= -1.

So κ has mass dimension -1.

Now, the second part of the question: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constants. For a theory to be renormalizable, all coupling constants must have a mass dimension ≤ (4 − n), where n is the number of spacetime dimensions. Wait, no. Alternatively, in four dimensions, a theory is renormalizable if the coupling has a mass dimension ≥ 0, because terms with negative mass dimension would imply non-renormalizable interactions.

Wait, wait. Let me recall the renormalizability criteria. In 4-dimensional spacetime, the mass dimension of a coupling constant k is given by [k] = 4 - (sum of fields dimensions in the term). For a term to be renormalizable, the dimension of the coupling must be ≥ 0.

Wait, no, wait. Each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So if the coupling has a negative dimension, that term would require higher-order terms for renormalizability, making it non-renormalizable.

For example, the Yang-Mills term is F^2, which has F as dimension 2, so F^2 is dimension 4, and the coupling is dimensionless. So that's renormalizable.

In our case, we have a term with coupling κ, which has dimension -1. So the dimension is negative. That suggests the theory is non-renormalizable because the coupling has a negative mass dimension.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The dimension of the coupling is [κ]=-1. For a term like κ ψ̄ σ ψ F, which is dimension 4, each term in the Lagrangian must be dimension 4. So if the coupling has a negative dimension, then that term is allowed, but when considering the renormalization, such terms typically require higher-order counterterms, which aren't available, making the theory non-renormalizable.

Alternatively, the general rule is that a coupling constant with positive mass dimension implies the interaction is relevant, dimensionless implies marginal, and negative implies irrelevant (but irrelevant terms are not renormalizable in the traditional sense).

So if [κ] is negative, the interaction is irrelevant, and the theory is non-renormalizable.

So putting it together, κ has dimension -1, which is negative, so the theory is not renormalizable.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C says [κ]=-1 and the theory is not renormalizable.

Option A says [κ]=-1 and theory is renormalizable: no.

Option D says [κ]=1 and theory not renormalizable: no.

Option B says [κ]=1 and theory is renormalizable: but our calculation said [κ]=-1.

So the correct option is C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$.
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ tensor is constructed from dimensionless gamma matrices $\gamma_\mu$, so it is also dimensionless: $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian term $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$ must have mass dimension $4$ because the action is dimensionless in natural units. Breaking down the dimensions of the term:
\[
[\kappa] + [\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = 4.
\]
Since $[\bar{\psi}] = [\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$ and $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$, substituting these values gives:
\[
[\kappa] + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
For a theory to be renormalizable in four spacetime dimensions, the mass dimension of the coupling constant must satisfy $[\kappa] \geq 0$. In this case, $[\kappa] = -1$, which is negative. This implies that the interaction term is non-renormalizable because it requires higher-order counterterms that are not available in the standard renormalization framework.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable. Comparing with the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. While $[\kappa] = -1$, the theory is not renormalizable.
- **B**: Incorrect. $[\kappa]$ is not $1$.
- **C**: Correct. $[\kappa] = -1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
- **D**: Incorrect. $[\kappa]$ is not $1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
