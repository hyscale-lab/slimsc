Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about chemical reactions and determining the molecular symmetry group of a product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

First, I'll try to parse all the information given. Let's break down each reaction.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
   - Hmm, 8 equivalents suggest a ratio of 1:8. Maybe A is in a lower oxidation state and B is an oxidizing agent? Or perhaps B is acting as a nucleophile.

2. When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces product E, which is extremely hazardous.
   - So the reaction here is C + 2D → E. I wonder what E could be. Maybe something like a diatomic molecule or a compound with high symmetry.

3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.
   - So, C + H2O → A + F + G.
   - Since F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, maybe F is like HCl (strong) and G is like H2SO3 (weak, sulfurous acid). Or maybe F is HNO3 and G is H2S? Or other combinations.

4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.
   - D + B → H. H is a solvent, so maybe H is something like H2O or maybe an alcohol. Or perhaps something like NH3, but that's a gas. Or D and B are diatomic gases that combine in 1:1 ratio. Like H2O (if B is H2 and D is O2, but then H2O is a solvent. Alternatively, if B is Cl2 and D is O2, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, more likely, perhaps D is O2 and B is H2? Then H would be H2O, which is a solvent.

Wait, let me think. If D is O2 and B is H2, then H would be H2O. Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is something else. But let's see.

Wait, perhaps B is a diatomic gas like Cl2, and D is another diatomic gas. Alternatively, when D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio, maybe it's like SO2 and O2 forming something else? Not sure. Alternatively, if B is Cl2 and D is O2, then their reaction might form something else, but I'm not certain.

Let me try to think about what C could be. Since C reacts with water to produce two acids, F and G. Suppose C is a compound that when hydrolyzed gives two different oxyacids. For example, maybe C is SO3. But wait, SO3 hydrolyzes to H2SO4, which is a strong acid. Hmm, but the problem says two different acids, F and G. So perhaps C is something like a sulfate ester or something more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chloride. Wait, but if C is a nitrate or sulfate, then when it reacts with water, you get H+ ions from the acid. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, the initial reaction: A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C. 8 equivalents suggest a stoichiometric ratio of 1:8. What compounds react in such a way? Maybe A is Fe metal and B is O2, but that would form FeO, but that's not bright red. Wait, Fe(III) oxide is reddish, but not sure about 8 equivalents.

Another thought: perhaps A is a metal, and B is a halogen. For example, if A is copper metal and B is Cl2, then 2 equivalents of Cl2 would react with Cu to form CuCl2. But wait, 8 equivalents would imply 4 moles of Cl2 per mole of Cu. That would lead to CuCl4, perhaps? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if A is S (sulfur) and B is O2, then 8 equivalents would be 4 O2 per S. But that would form SO4^2-? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a compound with a lot of symmetry. Because the question is about the molecular symmetry group of E. So E's symmetry is key. Let's think about E.

E is produced by C reacting with 2 equivalents of D. So, C + 2D → E. Let me think about possible E candidates. If E is a diatomic molecule, like O2, N2, Cl2? No, perhaps E is a more complex molecule.

Wait, another angle: H is a solvent formed by D and B in a 1:1 ratio. Common solvents are H2O (if D is O2 and B is H2), but that requires H2 and O2 reacting in 1:1 ratio, but they typically form H2O in a 2:1 ratio (2H2 + O2 → 2H2O). Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is something else. If B is Cl2 and D is another halogen, like F2, then their reaction would form something else. Alternatively, maybe B is H2 and D is O2. Or perhaps B is a diatomic gas and D is another diatomic gas that reacts 1:1.

Wait, another thought: Maybe H is NH3. Then D and B would have to combine in a 1:1 ratio to form NH3. So perhaps B is H2 and D is N2. But N2 and H2 react in a 3:1 ratio to form NH3, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2. They could react to form HCl. So D is H2 and B is Cl2, giving HCl. HCl is a gas, but it's used as a solvent? Wait, no, HCl is a gas but in solution it's aqueous.

Alternatively, maybe H is something like CH4. But that doesn't seem to fit the reaction ratio. Maybe I'm going about this the wrong way.

Let me think about the products. The second reaction is C + 2D → E. If E has a high symmetry, perhaps it's something like O2, or Cl2, but those are diatomic and have their own symmetry groups. Alternatively, E could be CO2, which is linear and has D∞h symmetry. Or perhaps E is a molecule with a different structure.

Wait, another angle: The products when C reacts with water are acids. So when C hydrolyzes, it produces two acids. Let's say F is a strong acid like HCl, and G is a weak acid like H2SO3 (sulfurous acid). How would C look for that? Maybe C is ClSO3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate, like NaNO3. When it reacts with water, it would produce HNO3 (strong acid) and NaOH? But that's a base, not an acid. Hmm, not quite.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite, like CaSO3. When it reacts with water, it could hydrolyze into H2SO3 (sulfurous acid, weak) and Ca(OH)2. But that leaves F as H2SO3 (weak), and G as Ca(OH)2? No, that doesn't fit because G is an acid, not a base.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate. So when it reacts with water, it might form HNO3 (strong acid) and another acid. But I'm not sure what the other acid would be.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester or something else. Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound with multiple functional groups that when hydrolyzed produce two different acids.

Let me think about the first reaction again. Solid A + 8 B → C. Maybe A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas. For example, if A is Fe and B is Cl2, then 3 Fe + 3 Cl2 → FeCl3. But that's a 1:1 ratio, not 1:8. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A is a non-metal. Like sulfur. If A is S8 (the solid form), and B is O2. Then, S8 + 8 O2 → 8 SO3? No, that's not the typical reaction. Sulfur and oxygen form SO2 or SO3. Let's think: S8 + O2 → SO3^4-? Not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is a metal oxide. For example, if A is FeO (solid), and B is Cl2 (gas). Then the reaction would be FeO + Cl2 → FeCl3 + OCl2? Not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal sulfide reacting with Cl2 to form a chloride and SO2? But not matching the 8 equivalents.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal and B is a diatomic molecule that adds 8 times. For example, if A is sodium (Na), and B is Cl2, then 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. But that's a 1:1 ratio, not 8:1. So that's not it.

Wait, 8 equivalents of B. So the stoichiometric ratio is 1:8. So perhaps the formula is A + 8B → C.

Looking for a compound where the ratio is 1:8. Perhaps A is a metal and B is a halogen. For example, if A is Ag and B is Cl2, the reaction would be 2Ag + Cl2 → 2AgCl. That's 1:1 for Ag:Cl2. So not 1:8.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a non-metal. Let's think of phosphorus. P4 reacts with Cl2 to form PCl5. The ratio would be 1 P4 : 5 Cl2 → 2 PCl5. So 1:5 ratio, not 1:8.

Wait, if A is phosphorus and B is O2, perhaps forming something like P4O10. The reaction would be P4 + 5 O2 → 2 P4O10. So that's 1 P4 : 5 O2 → 2 P4O10. But the equivalents are 5, not 8.

Another approach: perhaps A is a metal in a lower oxidation state and B is an oxidizing agent. For example, Fe metal reacting with O2 to form FeO. But that's not bright red. Fe2O3 is reddish, but the reaction is 4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3. So 4:3 ratio, not 1:8.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe A is a transition metal and B is a diatomic molecule that adds 8 equivalents. Let's think of molybdenum or tungsten. For example, Mo reacting with O2 to form MoO3. The reaction would be 2 Mo + 3 O2 → 2 MoO3. That's 2:3, not 1:8. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal and B is a polyatomic gas. But the question says B is a gas, probably diatomic.

Wait, going back to C reacting with water to produce two acids. Suppose C is a sulfate ester. For example, if C is NaHSO4, then when it reacts with water, it would produce HSO4^- which is a weak acid (sulfurous acid? No, HSO4^- is actually a weak acid, but in solution it can act as a strong acid because it's a conjugate base of a weaker acid). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate and a sulfate. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Another thought: F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So maybe when C reacts with water, it produces H+ ions that come from these acids. For example, if C has both SO4^2- and Cl^- ions, but that's not likely because then it would be a salt.

Wait, wait. Let me think about C. C is the product of A and B. So maybe A is a metal oxide, and B is a diatomic acid. Wait, maybe A is Na2O and B is SO3. Then, Na2O + SO3 → Na2SO4. But that's 1:1 ratio, not 8.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas. Let's think of sodium reacting with chlorine gas. 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. That's 1:1. Not 8.

Wait, another angle: Let me think about the reaction where C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. If E is a highly symmetrical molecule, perhaps E is O2, which has a certain symmetry. But O2 is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry, I think. Alternatively, if E is Cl2, that's also D∞h.

Wait, but the problem says E is extremely hazardous. O2 isn't that hazardous, but maybe E is something like SO2 or something else. Alternatively, E could be HCl gas, but that's not symmetrical.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe E is a molecule like O3 (ozone), which has a bent structure and C2v symmetry. Ozone is a strong oxidizing agent and can be hazardous, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps E is CO2, which is linear and has D∞h symmetry. CO2 is a gas, and it's a product, but is it extremely hazardous? Maybe not in small amounts.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about the reaction C + 2D → E. If D is a diatomic gas like O2, then 2D would be O2. So C + O2 → E. What reacts with O2 to form a highly symmetrical product? Maybe C is a metal oxide and E is a higher oxide. But then symmetry might not be the key factor.

Alternatively, if D is H2, then 2H2 would combine with C. But not sure.

Wait, back to the first part where D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. If H is water, then D and B would be H2 and O2. But H2 and O2 react in a 2:1 ratio to form H2O. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe H is another solvent like ethanol. But then D and B would be something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps D is O2 and B is another gas. Let's say B is N2. Then D (O2) and B (N2) don't react in 1:1. Alternatively, B is H2, D is O2. Then H would be H2O, but the reaction ratio is 2:1 for H2 and O2 to form H2O. So that doesn't fit the 1:1 ratio.

Hmm, maybe H isn't H2O. What other solvents are there that are formed from two diatomic gases in a 1:1 ratio? Maybe NH3 is formed from N2 and H2 in a 3:1 ratio, but that's not 1:1.

Alternatively, maybe H is something like CH4, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps D is a diatomic gas like Cl2 and B is another gas like F2. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form ClF, which is a solvent? I'm not familiar with ClF as a solvent. Doesn't ring a bell.

Alternatively, maybe D is O2 and B is F2. They could form OF2, but I'm not sure about its properties.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a gas but used as a solvent? Doesn't make sense. Solvents are typically liquid.

Wait, perhaps B is O2 and D is another gas. For example, B is O2 and D is F2, reacting to form O2F2. But I don't know if that's a solvent.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for the symmetry part first. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If E has a very high symmetry, perhaps it's a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry, like O2 or Cl2. Alternatively, a linear molecule like CO2 has D∞h symmetry.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule with a trigonal planar structure, like BF3, but that's not diatomic. Alternatively, maybe E is a polyatomic molecule with a certain symmetry.

Wait, but the question is about the molecular symmetry group of E. So I need to figure out what E is, based on the reactions, then determine its symmetry.

Let me think of E being a product of C and 2 D. If E is O2, which is diatomic, then the symmetry group is D∞h.

Alternatively, if E is H2O, which is bent, the symmetry group is C2v. Hmm, but H2O is a solvent, not produced in the reaction unless C is O and D is H2. Not sure.

Wait, another idea: If E is a molecule like O3 (ozone), which has a bent structure and a symmetry group of C2v. Ozone is a highly reactive and hazardous gas, which fits the description of E.

So if E is O3, its symmetry group would be C2v (option D). Alternatively, if E is Cl2, symmetry D∞h (option B).

But how to tie this back to the reactions.

Let me think: If C is O2, then E would be O2 reacting with D to form O3. But that would require D to be O as well, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, C could be something else.

Wait, maybe C is a peroxide. For example, if C is H2O2, which is a bright red liquid? No, H2O2 is colorless. Wait, maybe C is a chromium compound. Not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the reaction where C reacts with water to produce two acids. If C is a compound that releases H+ when it hydrolyzes, producing two different acids, maybe F and G. For example, if C is a sulfite ester, perhaps it would produce H2SO3 and another acid.

Wait, perhaps C is something like NaHSO3. When it reacts with water, it would produce HSO3^- which is a weak acid (sulfurous acid) and NaOH (a strong base, but not an acid. So that doesn't fit the description.

Alternatively, if C is a sulfonate ester, like RSO3-O-R', but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate and a sulfate ester. For instance, if C is NaNO3·Na2SO4, then upon hydrolysis, it would produce HNO3 (strong acid) and H2SO4 (strong acid), but F and G are different, so that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps C is a mixture of two salts. But I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a metal sulfide, like FeS. When it reacts with water, it produces H2S (a weak acid) and Fe(OH)2. But Fe(OH)2 is a base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3. Reacting with water doesn't produce acids; it requires acid for dissolution.

Wait, maybe C contains both nitrate and sulfate ions. For example, NaNO3 and Na2SO4. But that's a mixture, not a compound.

Wait, perhaps C is a complex salt. For instance, something like NaHSO4. When it reacts with water, it would dissociate into H+ (from HSO4^-) and Na+ and SO4^2-.

Wait, HSO4^- can act as an acid (strong, since it's a weak acid's conjugate base). Wait, HSO4^- is a weak acid (it's the conjugate acid of H2SO4, which is a strong acid. HSO4^- can donate a proton to become SO4^2-, so it's a weak acid. So F could be HCl (strong) and G could be HSO4^- (weak). But where would Cl come from?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chloride and a sulfate. For example, if C is NaCl and Na2SO4, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixture of two salts. But the initial reaction forms a single product C, so probably not.

Wait, maybe C is a compound that upon hydrolysis produces two different acids. Let's say C is a metal sulfite. For example, ZnSO3. When it reacts with water, maybe it hydrolyzes to produce H2SO3 (weak acid, sulfurous acid) and Zn(OH)2. But Zn(OH)2 is a base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Let's try to think about E.

E is produced by C + 2 D. If E is a diatomic molecule with high symmetry, like O2 or Cl2, then its symmetry group would be D∞h. Alternatively, if E is O3, its group is C2v.

Wait, another angle: If D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Let's say B is H2 and D is O2. Then H would be H2O, which is a solvent. But the reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So that's a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. So that can't be.

Alternatively, if B is F2 and D is H2, then their reaction in 1:1 ratio would be F2 + H2 → 2 HF. But HF is a gas, not a solvent.

Wait, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2. Then H would be H2O, but the stoichiometry is 2:1, not 1:1. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2. Then, Cl2 + H2 → 2 HCl. HCl is a gas, but not a solvent. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: Maybe B is O2 and D is H2O? No, D is a gas, so H2O is a liquid. Doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I need to make some assumptions to proceed.

Let me assume that E is O3. Then, the symmetry group would be C2v, option D. But is that the case?

Wait, another approach: Think of E as a molecule with a certain symmetry. For example, benzene has D6h symmetry, but that's not one of the options. SO2 has C2v symmetry. O3 has C2v symmetry as well.

If E is O3, then how would the reactions fit?

Let me map it out:

1. A + 8 B → C (bright red)
2. C + 2 D → E (O3)
3. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
4. D + B → H (solvent)

Assuming E is O3, which is a triatomic molecule with a bent structure, symmetry C2v.

In reaction 4, D and B combine in 1:1 to make H, a solvent.

If H is H2O, then D and B should be H2 and O2? But their reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, which is 2:1. Doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps H is something else. Let's think of H as NH3, but that's a gas and doesn't fit as a solvent unless it's liquid. NH3 is a liquid under certain conditions. But how would D and B form NH3 in a 1:1 ratio?

Alternatively, maybe D is N2 and B is H2. Then, their reaction would be N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3. So that's a 1:3 ratio, not 1:1. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe B is H2 and D is F2. So their reaction would be H2 + F2 → 2 HF. But HF is a gas, not a solvent. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another angle. If H is a solvent like ethanol, but that's a larger molecule. How would D and B (diatomic gases) form ethanol in a 1:1 ratio? Doesn't seem plausible.

Wait, perhaps H is a diatomic molecule used as a solvent, like H2O. But as I said earlier, the reaction ratio doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe D is O2 and B is another diatomic gas, but I can't figure out what would fit the 1:1 ratio.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck trying to find H. Let me think differently.

If E is O3, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → O3. So D must be O2, because O3 is formed by adding O2. So 2 D would be O2, so C + O2 → O3.

Wait, that would mean C is O, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps C is O2, but then reaction 2 would be O2 + 2 O2 → O3. That doesn't make sense either.

Wait, another thought: Maybe D is O, but O is O2. So C + 2 O2 → E. But that still doesn't clarify E.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me think about the acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Common strong acids are HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak acids are like H2SO3, H3PO3, CH3COOH.

If C reacts with water to produce a strong and a weak acid, perhaps C is a sulfite ester. For example, if C is NaHSO3, then it hydrolyzes to H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base, not acid). So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate and a sulfate. But when it hydrolyzes, it would produce HNO3 and H2SO4, both strong acids. But problem states two different acids, one strong, one weak. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another idea: Maybe C is a chloride and a sulfite. For example, if C is NaCl and Na2SO3, but that's a mixture, not a compound. So probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed anhydride. For example, something that when hydrolyzed produces two different acids. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a carbonate. For example, Na2CO3. When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to produce HCO3^- (which can act as a weak acid, like carbonic acid) and NaOH (a strong base). So F would be HCO3^- (weak acid), but G is NaOH (a base), which doesn't fit because G should be an acid.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a compound that releases H+ into water, forming two different acids. For example, if C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong acid. Let's say C is NaHSO4. NaHSO4 in water dissociates into Na+ and HSO4^- (which is a weak acid). So F would be HSO4^- (weak acid), and another acid from where? Unless there's another component.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of two salts, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal hydroxide. For example, if C is Fe(OH)3, it doesn't produce acids upon hydrolysis. Instead, it might decompose.

This is getting quite complicated. Maybe I should consider that C is a diatomic molecule that when hydrolyzed produces two different acids. For example, if C is ClF, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound like SO2Cl2. When it reacts with water, it could hydrolyze into H2SO4 (strong acid) and HCl (strong acid). But F and G need to be different, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: Let's think of C as a compound that when hydrolyzed produces a strong acid and a weak acid. For instance, if C is a nitro compound, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a chlorate, like KClO3. When it reacts with water, it would produce HClO3 (a strong acid, though not as strong as HCl or H2SO4) and KOH (a strong base). So F would be HClO3 (weak acid), G would be KOH (base). Doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester. For example, if C is something like RSO3-O-R', then upon hydrolysis it would produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and another acid. But I'm not certain.

I think I'm going in circles here. Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options given.

The question is about the molecular symmetry group of E. Let me think about which of the options are associated with which types of molecules.

Option B is D4h. That symmetry is common in molecules like SO4^2- (tetrahedral), but also in some other molecules. Option C is D∞h, which applies to linear molecules like CO2, O2, Cl2. Option D is C2v, which applies to bent molecules like H2O and O3.

If E is O3, symmetry is C2v (option D). If E is O2, symmetry is D∞h (option B). If E is SO2, symmetry is D∞h (but wait, no, SO2 is bent, which is C2v). Wait, SO2 has a bent structure, so its symmetry is C2v.

Now, if E is SO2, which is a gas, and extremely hazardous, that could fit. SO2 is a toxic gas.

So if E is SO2, its symmetry is C2v, which is option D.

But how does that fit into the reactions?

Let me retrace the steps:

1. A + 8 B → C (bright red)
2. C + 2 D → SO2 (E)
3. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
4. D + B → H (solvent)

So, D is a gas that when reacted with B in 1:1 forms a solvent. If E is SO2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → SO2. So D must be a diatomic gas like O2, perhaps.

So, C + 2 O2 → SO2. Wait, but SO2 is formed from S and O2. So perhaps C is S, and D is O2.

Wait, but in reaction 1, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C (S). So, 1 A + 8 B → S. What could B be?

If B is O2, then A would be something that reacts with O2 to form sulfur. But that's not common. Alternatively, perhaps B is H2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps A is S8 (solid sulfur), and B is O2. Then, the reaction would be S8 + 8 O2 → 8 SO3? Or maybe not. S8 + O2 → SO2 or SO3. But the stoichiometry isn't matching.

Wait, perhaps A is FeS (solid), and B is O2. Then, FeS + 8 O2 → Fe2(SO4)3? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A is carbon (solid), and B is O2. Then, carbon reacts with O2 to form CO or CO2. But how many equivalents? For example, 2C + 3 O2 → 2 CO2. That's 2:3 ratio. Not 1:8.

Hmm, I'm not making progress here. Let me try to accept that E's symmetry is C2v, option D, because that's one of the higher symmetry options and fits with SO2 or O3.

Alternatively, if E is O3, which has C2v symmetry, then I think that's a possibility.

But without knowing E, it's hard. So perhaps the answer is D) C2v.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of chemical reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. This suggests a stoichiometric ratio of 1:8, but the exact identity of A and B is unclear. Possible candidates for A and B include metals and diatomic gases, but the exact nature remains ambiguous.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, described as extremely hazardous. The symmetry of E depends on its molecular structure. If E is a diatomic molecule like O₂ or Cl₂, it would have **D∞h** symmetry. If E is a bent molecule like O₃ or SO₂, it would have **C₂v** symmetry.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This suggests that C is a compound that hydrolyzes to yield acids. For example, if C is a sulfite or nitrate, it could produce H₂SO₃ (weak acid) and HNO₃ (strong acid). However, the exact identity of C remains uncertain.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Possible candidates for H include H₂O or NH₃, but the reaction stoichiometry and identities of D and B are unclear.

Given the options for the molecular symmetry group of E:
- **C₂**: This symmetry is unlikely, as it corresponds to simple molecules like H₂O₂, which do not match the description of E.
- **D₄h**: This symmetry is common in tetrahedral molecules like SO₄²⁻, but E is described as a product of C and 2D, which does not align with this symmetry.
- **D∞h**: This symmetry applies to linear molecules like O₂ or Cl₂. While these are highly symmetrical, they do not align with the description of E being extremely hazardous.
- **C₂v**: This symmetry applies to bent molecules like O₃ or SO₂. O₃ (ozone) is a highly reactive and hazardous gas, making it a plausible candidate for E.

Based on the analysis, E is most likely O₃, which has **C₂v** symmetry. This aligns with the description of E as extremely hazardous and the molecular symmetry group provided in the options.

**Answer: D**
