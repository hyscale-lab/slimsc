Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They give the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, as 5x10^10. And they want the concentration of calcium ions. The options are A to D, with various concentrations.

Hmm, I remember that when a metal ion like Ca forms a complex with a ligand like EDTA, the complex dissociates into the metal ion and the ligand. The formation constant, K, measures how strong the complex is. A higher K means the complex is more stable, so it doesn't dissociate much.

Wait, the formula for the formation constant K is something like K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]). Oh wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Since EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, each EDTA^4- binds to Ca^2+. So the complex is CaEDTA^2−, right?

So the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA⁴− ⇌ CaEDTA²−. The formation constant K is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴−]). 

But wait, in solution, EDTA is usually in various protonated forms because it's a polyprotic acid. However, the problem states that the pH is ideal, which I think means that EDTA is fully deprotonated as EDTA^4- and doesn't affect the calculation. So we can proceed under that assumption.

So, the solution has 0.02 M CaEDTA²−. Let's denote the concentration of Ca²+ as [Ca²+] and the concentration of EDTA⁴− as [EDTA⁴−]. Since the complex dissociates into these, but with a very high K, the dissociation is minimal. 

Wait, but the problem is about the concentration of Ca²+ in solution. Since the complex doesn't dissociate much (because K is large), [Ca²+] should be very small.

But wait, how do I approach this? Let me think. The total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and all of it comes from Ca²+ and EDTA⁴− combining. So the initial assumption is that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA⁴− are very small because K is large.

Wait, no. Actually, the total concentration of Ca and EDTA in solution comes from the dissociation of CaEDTA²−. But if the K is very large, the complex doesn't dissociate much, meaning that [Ca²+] and [EDTA⁴−] are both small.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. At equilibrium, a small amount x of the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA⁴−. So:

[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA⁴−] = x

Because for each mole of complex that dissociates, you get one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA⁴−. So [Ca²+] = [EDTA⁴−] = x.

Plugging into the K expression: K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴−]) 

So K = (0.02) / (x * x) ) = (0.02)/(x²) 

We know K is 5e10 (5x10^10). So,

5e10 = 0.02 / (x²)
=> x squared is 0.02 / 5e10
x^2 = 0.02 /5e10 = 2e-3 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 => 4e-14

So x is sqrt(4e-14) = 2e-7 M.

Wait, that's 2e-7 M for [Ca²+]. But looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7, which is about sqrt(4e-13), perhaps?

Wait, did I make a miscalculation here?

Wait, let's recheck. Let me write it more carefully.

Given:

K = [CaEDTA²−] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA⁴−] )

Assuming that the dissociation is x, so:

[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA⁴−] = x

So K = (0.02)/(x^2) = 5e10

So x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13

x = sqrt(0.4e-13) = sqrt(4e-14) = 2e-7 M.

Wait, but 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 /5e10 is 4e-13, wait no: 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) e-12, which is 0.4e-12. Wait, maybe I messed up the exponents.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2.

So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, so x squared is 4e-13, x is 2e-6.5? Because sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is approximately 6.32456e-7.

Wait, wait, 4e-13 is 4.0 x 1e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, the square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7.

So 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M. Hmm, that's 6.32e-7, which is option C (6.3e-7 M).

Wait, but earlier I thought x was 2e-7, but I think I made a mistake in the exponent.

Let me redo:

K = 5e10 = 0.02 / x²

So x² = 0.02 / 5e10

0.02 is 2e-2.

So x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) *1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 (because sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5).

So 2e-6.5 is approximately 6.3e-7, since 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7, so 2 times that is 6.32e-7.

So [Ca²+] is 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

So the answer should be option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation equilibrium is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \rightleftharpoons \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) be \(x\). The concentrations at equilibrium are:
- \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 - x \approx 0.02\) (since \(x\) is very small),
- \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x\),
- \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\).

The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Substituting the equilibrium concentrations:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.
