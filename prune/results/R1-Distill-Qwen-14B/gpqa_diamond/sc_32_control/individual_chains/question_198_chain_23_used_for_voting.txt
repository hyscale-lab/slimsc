Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question involves cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution, and I need to find the percentage of a specific blue dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt species.

Hmm, I remember that when a metal ion is in solution with a ligand, they can form complexes. The stability of these complexes is determined by stability constants, also known as formation constants. The higher the β (beta) value, the more stable the complex is.

The problem gives me some data: the concentration of Co(II) is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate (SCN-) concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, I notice that β4 is lower than β3. That might be important.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. I think the blue one is probably the [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ complex, but I need to figure out which n corresponds to the blue color. I've heard that [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue, so that's likely the species we're talking about here. So n=4, probably.

Wait, but the options given are A to D, and the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. So I need to calculate the fraction of Co that is in the form of [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But wait, the formation of complexes follows a stepwise process. Each β represents the formation of the next complex from the previous one. So, the first complex is [CoSCN]^0, then [Co(SCN)_2]^+, etc. Actually, the notation might be a bit different. Let me think: the general formula is Co^2+ + n SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n), because each SCN is a −1 charge. So for n=1, the complex would be [CoSCN]^+, since 2+ + (-1) = +1. For n=2, it's [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (neutral). For n=3, [Co(SCN)_3]^- and for n=4, [Co(SCN)_4]^2−. So the blue one is the n=4 complex, [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, which has a β4 of 16.

Wait, no. The β values are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So these are the stability constants for each step:

β1 is for [CoSCN]^+ → β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]) =9.

β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → β2= [Co(SCN)_2]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2) =40.

Wait, but wait, the way the stability constants are defined might differ. Alternatively, β3 is for the third complex, so β3= [Co(SCN)_3^-]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3)=63.

And β4 is [Co(SCN)_4^2-]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4)=16.

But wait, the β values can't just be in any order because the highest β would indicate the most stable complex. Looking at the βs: β3=63 is the highest. So the most stable complex is the [Co(SCN)_3^-] complex. But wait, I thought the blue color was for the tetra-SCN complex. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the species up to [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, and the β4 is 16. So for each complex, the stability constant represents the step-wise formation. So to find the fraction of each complex, I think I need to calculate the fraction of Co in each possible complex.

The possible complexes are:

Co^2+ (n=0),

[CoSCN]^+ (n=1),

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2),

[Co(SCN)_3]^- (n=3),

[Co(SCN)_4]^2− (n=4).

Wait, but the β values are given as β1, β2, β3, β4. So maybe β1 is the formation of [CoSCN]^+ from Co^2+ and SCN^-.

So, the general approach is to consider the distribution of the metal between all possible complexes, given the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^- and the stability constants.

The total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all the species: [Co^2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)_2^0] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2−] = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

But since the solution also contains SCN^- at 0.1 M, which is much higher than the Co concentration, the ligand is in excess, so the distribution will be determined by the stability constants.

To find the fraction of each complex, I can model this using the formation constants.

I think the way to approach this is to use the stepwise formation constants and calculate the fraction of each complex.

The general formula is that for each complex, the fraction is given by (β1 * β2 * ... * βn) * [SCN]^n / (1 + β1[SCN] + β1β2[SCN]^2 + ... + β1β2β3β4[SCN]^4 )

Wait, but maybe another approach is better. Let me think: the fraction of each species can be calculated using the formation constants and the ligand concentration.

Each complex's fraction is given by (β1 * β2 * ... * βn) * [SCN]^n / K_total, where K_total is the sum of all terms from n=0 to n=4.

Wait, yes, the general formula for the fraction of each complex is:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn) [SCN]^n / Σ (from m=0 to m=4) (β1 β2 ... βm) [SCN]^m )

In this case, [SCN] is given as 0.1 M, and the βs are given for each step.

So, let me compute each term:

For m=0 (free Co^2+): term is 1 * [SCN]^0 = 1.

m=1: β1 * [SCN]^1 =9 * 0.1 =0.9.

m=2: β1 * β2 * [SCN]^2 =9 *40 * (0.1)^2= 360 * 0.01=3.6.

m=3: β1 * β2 * β3 * [SCN]^3 =9*40*63 * (0.1)^3.

Wait, let's compute that:

9*40=360; 360 *63=22680.

[0.1]^3=0.001. So 22680 * 0.001 =22.68.

m=4: β1*β2*β3*β4 * [SCN]^4.

Compute the product: 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880.

[SCN]^4 = (0.1)^4=0.0001.

So 362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

So the terms are:

m=0: 1

m=1:0.9

m=2:3.6

m=3:22.68

m=4:36.288.

Now sum all these terms for the denominator:

1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

Denominator is 64.468.

Now, the fraction for m=4 (the [Co(SCN)_4]^2− complex) is 36.288 /64.468.

Compute that: 36.288 ÷ 64.468 ≈ 0.563.

Wait, that's about 56.3%, but that's not among the options. Oh, wait, wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, the options are 42.3%, 25.6%, 38%, 16.9%. So my calculation suggests about 56%, which is not an option. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing β3 and β4? Let me check.

Wait, the β values:

β1=9 → for m=1,

β2=40 → for m=2,

β3=63 → for m=3,

β4=16 → for m=4.

So when calculating m=4, the product is β1 * β2 * β3 * β4 → 9 *40=360; 360 *63=22680; 22680 *16=362880. That's correct.

[SCN]^4 is 0.1^4 = 0.0001 → 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Denominator is 64.468.

Wait, but wait, no. Because each term is (β1 β2... βm) [SCN]^m. So for m=1, it's β1 [SCN]^1. For m=2, it's β1 β2 [SCN]^2. So the way I calculated is correct.

So the fraction for m=4 is 36.288 /64.468 ≈ 0.563, or 56.3%. But the options don't have that. Hmm. So perhaps I messed up the β values? Or maybe the question is about [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is m=2. Let's see.

Wait, wait! Oh, right, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN groups. So the complex [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So m=2. Therefore, I should find the fraction for m=2.

Wait, that's a good point. The question says "dithiocyanato" which is di = two. Oh, I see, I was looking for m=4, but maybe the correct m is 2.

So let me recalculate. The fraction for m=2 is 3.6 / 64.468.

3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05556, which is about 5.56%. Hmm, but that's not an option either. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood which complex is blue. Maybe the [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is blue, not the di one. But the options don't include 56%. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait another thought: Maybe the problem is considering only the first four complexes, but perhaps the highest β is for [Co(SCN)_3]^−, which is m=3.

But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the tetrathiocyanato complex, but the answer isn't matching the options. So maybe I made a mistake in the way I calculated.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants are given in a different way. For example, β is given as the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+ → β1 = [CoSCN]/[Co][SCN] =9.

β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → β2= [Co(SCN)_2]/([Co][SCN]^2) )=40.

β3 is [Co(SCN)_3^-]/([Co][SCN]^3) )=63.

β4 is [Co(SCN)_4^2-]/([Co][SCN]^4) )=16.

So the way I used the terms is correct.

Wait, but let's recalculate the fractions. Maybe I did a mistake in the denominator.

Sum of all terms:

m=0: 1

m=1:9 * 0.1 =0.9 → sum so far:1.9.

m=2:9 *40 *(0.1)^2= 360 *0.01=3.6 → sum 5.5.

m=3:9*40*63 * (0.1)^3= 22680 *0.001=22.68 → sum 28.18.

m=4:9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4 =362880 *0.0001=36.288 → sum 64.468.

So denominator is 64.468.

Now, the fraction for each m:

m=0:1/64.468≈0.01551.

m=1:0.9/64.468≈0.01396.

m=2:3.6/64.468≈0.05556.

m=3:22.68/64.468≈0.3519.

m=4:36.288/64.468≈0.5631.

So the percentages are:

m=0:≈1.55%

m=1:≈1.40%

m=2:≈5.56%

m=3:≈35.19%

m=4:≈56.31%

Wait, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. If dithiocyanato is two SCN groups, then m=2, which is about 5.56%, but that's not an option. The options are around 16%, 25%, 38%, 42%. So this suggests that perhaps I misunderstood which complex is blue.

Alternatively, maybe the blue complex is m=4, which I thought earlier, but that gives about 56% which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, looking back, perhaps the question refers to the first dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, but that would be m=2, which is 5.56%. Not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue is the [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, but the calculation gives 56% which is not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should consider that the formation constants are given for each ion in sequence, but maybe I should use the overall formation constants differently.

Wait, another formula: the fraction of the nth complex is given by:

fn = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1[SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + ... + β1β2...βn [SCN]^n )

But perhaps I should also account for the charge. Wait, no, because the formation constants are for each step. Wait, perhaps I'm correct in the earlier calculation.

But another thought: perhaps I should calculate the concentration of each complex based on the conditional formation constants.

Alternative approach: Let's think about the possible complexes and their concentrations.

Let me define:

[Co^2+] = x.

[CoSCN^+] = y.

[Co(SCN)_2^0] = z.

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = w.

[Co(SCN)_4^2−] = v.

The total cobalt concentration is x + y + z + w + v = 1e-2 M.

Each complex can be expressed in terms of x and the ligand concentration [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

The formation equations are:

y = β1 x [SCN] → y=9 * x *0.1 = 0.9x.

z= β2 x [SCN]^2 → z=40 * x * 0.01 =0.4x.

w= β3 x [SCN]^3 →63 * x *0.001=0.063x.

v= β4 x [SCN]^4 →16 *x *0.0001=0.0016x.

Wait, no, because each step is dependent on the previous complexes.

Wait, no, that approach isn't correct because each step builds on the previous. So each subsequent complex is formed from the previous one plus another SCN^-.

Wait, perhaps I should model it step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps the total concentration is the sum x + y + z + w + v =1e-2.

But y = β1 x [SCN] → y=9 x *0.1 = 0.9x.

z = β2 [Co(SCN)_2] =β2 (y [SCN]) → because [Co(SCN)_2] is formed from [CoSCN]^+ plus another SCN. So z= β2 y [SCN] = β2 *0.9x *0.1.

Wait, that would be 40 *0.9x *0.1=40 *0.09x=3.6x.

Similarly, w= β3 z [SCN] =63 *3.6x *0.1=63 *0.36x=22.68x.

v= β4 w [SCN] =16 *22.68x *0.1=16 *2.268x=36.288x.

Now, putting all into the total:

x + y + z + w +v =x +0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x = (1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288) x = (64.868)x =1e-2.

So x=1e-2 /64.868 ≈1.54e-4 M.

Then, the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex (if that's m=2, which is z) is z=3.6x =3.6 *1.54e-4 ≈5.544e-5 M.

The total concentration is 1e-2, so the fraction is (5.544e-5)/(1e-2) =5.544e-3 → 0.5544% → approximately 0.55%. But that's way lower than the options given.

Wait, that can't be right. There must be a mistake in this approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the step-by-step approach isn't correct because each complex is formed from the free Co^2+ and the necessary number of SCN^- ions. So the correct way is to model each complex's concentration based on the free Co^2+.

Wait, another approach: using the formation constants to compute the fraction of each complex.

The general formula for the fraction is:

fn = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n) / ( sum_{k=0}^4 (β1 β2 ... βk [SCN]^k) )

So for each m, fn is the product of β's up to m, multiplied by [SCN]^m, divided by the sum of all such terms from m=0 to m=4.

So, for m=4:

fn = (β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4) / denominator.

As calculated before, denominator is 64.468.

fn=36.288/64.468≈0.563 →56.3% which is not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement refers to the dithiocyanato complex but with multiple ligands. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is m=2. That would be 3.6/64.468≈5.56% which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formation of the complexes is not considering all four steps but only up to the third? Let me check the β4.

Alternatively, perhaps the β4 is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, but perhaps it's not the most stable because β3 is higher. So the most stable is [Co(SCN)_3]^−, which is m=3. So the fraction for m=3 is 22.68/64.468≈35.19%, which is around 35.2%. That's close to option C (38.1%). Hmm, but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recheck all the calculations.

Compute each term:

m=0:1.

m=1: β1 * [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9. Term=0.9.

m=2: β1*β2 * [SCN]^2=9*40 *0.01=360 *0.01=3.6.

m=3: β1*β2*β3 * [SCN]^3=9*40 *63 * (0.1)^3.

9*40=360, 360*63=22680. 22680 * 0.001=22.68.

m=4: β1*β2*β3*β4 * [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16 *0.0001.

Compute 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362880; 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum all terms:1 +0.9=1.9 → +3.6=5.5 →+22.68=28.18 →+36.288=64.468.

So, fractions:

m=0: 1/64.468 ≈ 0.0155 →1.55%.

m=1:0.9/64.468≈0.01396 →1.396%.

m=2:3.6/64.468≈0.05556 →5.556%.

m=3:22.68/64.468≈0.3519 →35.19%.

m=4:36.288/64.468≈0.563 →56.3%.

Wait, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is m=4. So 56.3% is not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the β values are given in a different order. For example, β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc., but maybe the actual complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^m where m=2−n. So [Co(SCN)_n]^ (2−n). So for [CoSCN]^+, n=1, charge is 2-1=+1. [Co(SCN)_2]^0, n=2.

Wait, but that doesn't change the fractions. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the solution is in terms of the free Co^2+ and SCN^- but not all the possible complexes, but that's unclear.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the stability constants are given for the overall complexes, not step-wise. That would change the calculation.

If β1 is the overall constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc.

But that's not the usual practice. Stability constants are generally given as step-wise, but sometimes overall. Let me double-check.

Wait, the problem says, "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16."

Hmm, perhaps each β is the overall for the nth complex. So:

β1 = [CoSCN^+]/( [Co^2+][SCN^-] )=9.

β2 = [Co(SCN)_2^0]/( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 )=40.

β3 = [Co(SCN)_3^-]/( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 )=63.

β4 = [Co(SCN)_4^2−]/( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4 )=16.

In that case, the fraction for each complex is calculated differently.

So, the fraction f1 for [CoSCN]^+ is (β1 [SCN]) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Similarly, f2 for [Co(SCN)_2^0] is (β2 [SCN]^2) / denominator.

Wait, let's calculate this.

Denominator D=1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

[SCN]=0.1 M.

Compute each term:

1 →1.

β1 [SCN]=9 *0.1=0.9.

β2 [SCN]^2=40 *0.01=0.4.

β3 [SCN]^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

β4 [SCN]^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Sum D=1 +0.9=1.9 → +0.4=2.3 → +0.063=2.363 → +0.0016=2.3646.

So D≈2.3646.

Now, the fractions:

f1= (β1 [SCN]) / D =0.9 /2.3646≈0.3806 →38.06%.

f2=(β2 [SCN]^2)/D=0.4/2.3646≈0.169 →16.9%.

f3=0.063/2.3646≈0.0266 →2.66%.

f4=0.0016/2.3646≈0.000677 →0.0677%.

So, the fractions are:

f1 ≈38%, f2≈16.9%, f3≈2.66%, f4≈0.0677%.

Wait, so the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (m=2, the dithiocyanato) is f2≈16.9%, which is option D. But wait, the question asks for the blue dithiocyanato complex. If the blue is [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, then f4 is about 0.0677%, which is not an option. So that can't be.

But if the blue is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, then the fraction is 16.9%, which is option D. But the options given include 16.9% as option D, but the question mentions the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I thought was m=4.

Hmm, but the calculation now suggests that the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is about 16.9%, which is option D. But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato, which I thought was [Co(SCN)_4]^2−. But perhaps the blue is [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the colors. Let me think: I've heard that [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is blue, and [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is pink or another color. Alternatively, maybe [Co(SCN)_3]^− is blue. Wait, I'm not entirely sure about the colors. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to calculate the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is 16.9%, option D. But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato, which might not be this complex. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the β values as step-wise when they are overall.

Wait, but in the first approach, when I considered step-wise βs, the fraction for m=4 was 56.3%, which isn't an option. But when I considered the βs as overall, the fraction for m=2 (dithiocyanato) is 16.9%, which is option D.

But the question is about the blue complex. If the blue is [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, then none of the options match. If it's [Co(SCN)_2]^0, the answer is D (16.9%). But the options given include 38.1% as option C. Hmm.

Wait, in the step-wise approach, the fraction for m=3 was about 35%, which is close to option C (38.1%). But that's for [Co(SCN)_3]^−, which may not be blue.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the first dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, and the fraction is 16.9%, which is option D.

So, given the options, the correct answer would be D) 16.9%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants and the ligand concentration. The stability constants are provided as β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16, and the thiocyanate concentration is [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M.

### Key Steps:
1. **Fraction of Each Complex**:  
   The fraction of each cobalt complex is calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_1 \beta_2 \dots \beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^4 \beta_1 \beta_2 \dots \beta_m [\text{SCN}]^m}
   \]  
   Here, \( [\text{SCN}] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \), and the denominator is the sum of contributions from all possible cobalt species.

2. **Terms for Each Complex**:  
   - For \( m = 0 \) (free Co²⁺):  
     \[
     \text{Term} = 1
     \]
   - For \( m = 1 \) ([CoSCN]⁺):  
     \[
     \text{Term} = \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9
     \]
   - For \( m = 2 \) ([Co(SCN)₂]⁰):  
     \[
     \text{Term} = \beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 9 \cdot 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 3.6
     \]
   - For \( m = 3 \) ([Co(SCN)₃]⁻):  
     \[
     \text{Term} = \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 9 \cdot 40 \cdot 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 22.68
     \]
   - For \( m = 4 \) ([Co(SCN)₄]²⁻):  
     \[
     \text{Term} = \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 9 \cdot 40 \cdot 63 \cdot 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 36.288
     \]

3. **Denominator**:  
   The total denominator is the sum of all terms:  
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 + 36.288 = 64.468
   \]

4. **Fractions of Each Complex**:  
   - For \( m = 0 \):  
     \[
     f_0 = \frac{1}{64.468} \approx 0.0155 \, (1.55\%)
     \]
   - For \( m = 1 \):  
     \[
     f_1 = \frac{0.9}{64.468} \approx 0.01396 \, (1.40\%)
     \]
   - For \( m = 2 \):  
     \[
     f_2 = \frac{3.6}{64.468} \approx 0.05556 \, (5.56\%)
     \]
   - For \( m = 3 \):  
     \[
     f_3 = \frac{22.68}{64.468} \approx 0.3519 \, (35.19\%)
     \]
   - For \( m = 4 \):  
     \[
     f_4 = \frac{36.288}{64.468} \approx 0.563 \, (56.3\%)
     \]

5. **Interpretation of the Blue Complex**:  
   The question specifies the "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." The term "dithiocyanato" refers to complexes with two SCN ligands, which corresponds to \( m = 2 \) ([Co(SCN)₂]⁰). The fraction of this species is approximately \( 5.56\% \), which does not match any of the provided options. However, if the blue complex refers to [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (m = 4), its fraction is \( 56.3\% \), which also does not match the options.  

6. **Revisiting the β Values**:  
   If the β values are interpreted as overall formation constants rather than stepwise constants, the fractions are recalculated. Using this approach:  
   - Denominator \( D = 1 + \beta_1[\text{SCN}] + \beta_2[\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_3[\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_4[\text{SCN}]^4 \):  
     \[
     D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
     \]
   - Fraction for \( m = 2 \):  
     \[
     f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{D} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169 \, (16.9\%)
     \]

This matches option D (16.9%). While the interpretation of the β values as stepwise constants suggests the blue complex is \( m = 4 \), the options provided align with the interpretation of β values as overall constants, where the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)₂]⁰) is \( 16.9\% \).

ANSWER: D
