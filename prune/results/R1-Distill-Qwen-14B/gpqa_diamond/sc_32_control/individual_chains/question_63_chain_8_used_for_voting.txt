Okay, so I need to figure out this quantum mechanics problem about diatomic molecules. Hmm, the question is about the momentum of a photon that causes a transition between energy states. Let me start by understanding what's given and what's being asked.

The molecule is diatomic, made of elements X and Y. The model used is the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of the photon that switches it to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, wait. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So the next state would be the first excited state. But since it's a diatomic molecule, I think the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational contributions.

I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized and given by some equation involving the rotational and vibrational quantum numbers. But wait, the fundamental state is the state with the lowest possible energy, which is the ground state. So the next state would be the first excited state. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

Wait, I think in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are determined by the rotational quantum number J, given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length isn't fixed, so maybe the vibrational energy comes into play as well. Oh right, the rotation-vibration coupling model includes both rotation and vibration.

So the total energy of the molecule would be the sum of the rotational and vibrational energies. The fundamental vibrational state is when the vibrational quantum number ν is 0. Then, the rotational states are considered. But wait, maybe the question is about transitioning from the ground state to the next state, which could involve a change in either vibrational or rotational energy.

Wait, no. The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state, so both ν and J are at their lowest. So the fundamental state is ν=0 and J=0. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be either increasing ν to 1 (vibrational excitation) or J to 1 (rotational excitation). But which has a lower energy?

Wait, the vibrational energy has a zero-point energy. The first vibrational state (ν=1) has higher energy than the ground state. Rotational states start at J=0. The energy for J=0 is the lowest rotational state. So the next state could be J=1 or ν=1. But which transition requires less energy? Because the photon's energy must match the energy difference.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the molecule being in the ground state of rotation and vibration, and the next state is the first excited state, which would be a combination of rotation and vibration.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible transitions. The fundamental state is the lowest energy, so any transition to a higher state would require the photon's energy to match the difference between the initial and final states.

But wait, the problem says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So what's the next state? Since the rotational and vibrational energies are quantized, the next state after the fundamental state (ν=0, J=0) would be the state with the smallest possible energy increase. So which transition gives the smallest energy increase: increasing J by 1 (to J=1) or ν by 1 (to ν=1)?

I need to calculate the energies for these transitions.

First, let's compute the rotational energy for J=1. The rotational energy is given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The rotational constant B is given by (hbar²)/(2 I ω²), but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, B is (h²)/(8 π² I c^2), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think B is calculated using the bond length and the reduced mass.

Wait, the rotational constant B is given by (h/(8 π² c I)) where I is the moment of inertia. Oh, wait, but also, sometimes B is expressed in terms of the rotational constant in energy units, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, the vibrational energy is given by E_vib = (1/2) h ω + h ω ν, where ν is the vibrational quantum number. So the ground state vibrational energy is (1/2) h ω, and the first excited state is (3/2) h ω. So the difference is h ω.

The rotational energy for J=0 is 0 (since E_rot = B J (J+1), so J=0 gives 0). For J=1, E_rot = B * 1 * 2 = 2B.

Now, which of these is smaller: 2B or h ω? Because the photon's energy must match the transition with the smallest possible energy difference.

Wait, given that the problem states that the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, perhaps the energy levels are a combination of both rotational and vibrational contributions. So the fundamental state is the lowest rotational and vibrational state, and the next state could be a combination of the next rotational or vibrational state.

But if the question is about the next state with the lowest energy, perhaps it's the state where either rotational or vibrational is excited, whichever requires less energy.

So we need to compute the rotational constant B and compare it to the vibrational energy quantum.

Given that, let's compute B.

The moment of inertia I is given by I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

μ is the reduced mass of the two atoms. The reduced mass formula is μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My), where Mx and My are the masses of X and Y.

Given: Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 /22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but I need to convert that into kilograms because the units for Planck's constant h is in J·s, which uses kg.

1 amu is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ let's calculate that.

1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ (1.8 * 1.66e-27) = approx 2.988e-27 kg.

But let me compute more accurately:

1.818 * 1.6605390666e-27 kg.

1.818 * 1.660539 ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ let's compute 1 * 1.6605 is 1.6605, 0.8*1.6605 is 1.3284, 0.018 *1.6605 is ~0.0299. Sum: 1.6605 + 1.3284 = 2.9889 +0.0299=3.0188.

So approximately 3.0188e-27 kg.

Now, the bond length r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ r² = 3.0188e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 is 4e-20.

So I = 3.0188e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 12.075e-47 kg·m² = 1.2075e-46 kg·m².

Wait, wait: 3.0188e-27 * 4e-20 = (3.0188 *4) e-47 → around 12.075e-47, which is 1.2075e-46 kg m².

Now, the rotational constant B is given by B = ħ² / (2 I), where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, ħ = h/(2π).

Wait, no, I think the formula is B = (h²)/(8 π² I c^2) for wavenumbers, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, B in energy terms is given by B = (h²)/(8 π² I) * (1/(4π c²))? Hmm, maybe I should look for the expression for the rotational constant in terms of energy.

Wait, another approach: the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant in energy units (e.g., Joules).

But wait, I think the rotational constant in terms of energy is given by B = (ℏ²)/(2 I), where ℏ is h/(2π).

So, ℏ = h/(2π) = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So B = (ℏ²)/(2 I) = ( (1.0545718e-34)^2 ) / (2 * 1.2075e-46 kg·m² )

Let's compute the numerator first: (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (since (1e-34)^2 = 1e-68, and 1.05^2 ≈1.1).

So numerator ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

Denominator: 2 * 1.2075e-46 = 2.415e-46 kg·m².

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2.415e-46) ) ≈ (1.112 / 2.415) * 1e-22 → approximately 0.4606 * 1e-22 → 4.606e-23 J.

Wait, that's the rotational constant B in Joules.

Now, the energy difference when J increases by 1. From J=0 to J=1, the rotational energy increases by E_rot = B [1*(1+1) - 0] = B * 2.

So ΔE_rot = 2 * B = 2 *4.606e-23 J ≈ 9.212e-23 J.

Hmm, but wait, the vibrational energy quantum is given by ΔE_vib = h ω.

Given that ω is 4e14 rad/s, so ΔE_vib = h * ω = 6.626e-34 J·s * 4e14 rad/s = 2.65e-19 J.

Wait, that's much larger than the rotational energy difference.

So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy should match the rotational transition, which is 2B ≈9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotation and vibration. So perhaps the next state is a combination where either J increases or ν increases, whichever requires less energy.

But in our case, the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational. So the photon would cause a rotational transition, not vibrational.

So the energy of the photon must match the rotational energy difference, which is 2B.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule is in the ground state (ν=0, J=0), the next state with the lowest energy after that would be the state where J=1, since that requires less energy. So the photon should have energy equal to the rotational transition energy, which is 2B.

So E_photon = 2B = 9.212e-23 J.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule's next state is the first state with higher energy, which could be either ν=1 or J=1. Since the rotational transition requires less energy, the photon must have that energy.

But wait, the problem states that the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model, which includes both rotation and vibration. So perhaps the energy levels are more complex, but the fundamental state is the lowest, and the next state is the next possible state, which could be a combination of the two.

Wait, but the question is about the lowest possible energy next state. So the minimal energy increase would involve the smallest possible energy difference. So between the rotational and vibrational transitions, which has the smaller ΔE?

We have ΔE_rot ≈9.2e-23 J, and ΔE_vib ≈2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy must match the rotational transition.

Therefore, the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J. But wait, the question asks for the momentum of the photon, not the energy. Oh right, because p = E/c for photons.

So the photon's momentum p is E/c.

So p = E_photon / c.

E_photon = 2B =9.212e-23 J.

Speed of light c is 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.212e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but wait—that's 3.07e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3.07e-31 N·s (since 1 N·s = 1 kg·m/s).

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1.9e-28 Ns → 1.9e-28 kg·m/s

Option B:2.3e-27 → 2.3e-27

Option C:1.1e-27 →1.1e-27

Option D:1.4e-28 →1.4e-28

Hmm, but my calculation gives about 3e-31, which is much smaller than any of the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in B. Let me double-check the steps.

First, calculating the reduced mass.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2)/(20+2) =40/22 ≈1.818 amu.

1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg, so μ ≈1.818 *1.6605e-27 = let me compute that accurately.

1.818 *1.6605e-27 = (1.8 *1.6605) + (0.018 *1.6605) → 1.8 *1.6605=2.9889, 0.018 *1.6605≈0.0299. Sum: 3.0188e-27 kg.

Bond length r=2 angstroms =2e-10 m.

Moment of inertia I = μ r² =3.0188e-27 kg * (2e-10)^2 =3.0188e-27 *4e-20 =1.2075e-46 kg m².

Rotational constant B = (ℏ²)/(2 I).

ℏ = h/(2π) =1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ℏ^2 = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J^2 s^2).

Then, 2I = 2 *1.2075e-46 =2.415e-46 kg m².

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2.415e-46) ) = (1.112 /2.415 ) * 1e-22 → approx 0.4606 *1e-22 → 4.606e-23 J.

So E_rot for J=1 is 2B=9.212e-23 J.

Then, photon's energy E=9.212e-23 J.

Momentum p = E/c.

c=3e8 m/s.

p=9.212e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s →3.07e-31 N·s.

But none of the options are close to this. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula for B wrong. Maybe the rotational constant in terms of energy is different.

Wait, another possible formula for rotational energy levels is E_rot = (h²)/(8π² I) * J (J+1). So B is h²/(8π² I).

Wait, let me recalculate B using that formula.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

So B = h²/(8 π² I).

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 ≈4.39e-67 J² s².

8 π² =8*(9.8696)≈78.9568.

So 8 π² I =78.9568 *1.2075e-46 ≈78.9568 *1.2e-46 ≈94.75e-46 =9.475e-45 kg m².

So B=4.39e-67 / 9.475e-45 = approx (4.39 /9.475 ) * 1e-22 → about 0.4636 *1e-22 →4.636e-23 J.

Same as before. So E_rot remains 9.212e-23 J.

Hmm, but again, the photon's momentum is 3e-31 Ns, which isn't among the options. So I think I must have misunderstood the model.

Wait, perhaps the model includes both rotational and vibrational changes. Let's think about the vibration.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is in the ground state (ν=0, J=0), and the next state is the lowest possible, which could be either J=1 or ν=1. But the vibrational energy is much higher, so the lowest energy next state is J=1.

But if the photon must cause a transition to the next higher energy state, which is J=1, then the energy is 2B as before.

But where am I getting the momentum so much lower than the options? Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, maybe I should have used the vibrational energy instead. Let me think.

If the photon's energy matches the vibrational transition, which is h ω.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

ω is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So E_vib = h ω =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

Then, the momentum p = E/c = 2.6504e-19 /3e8 = approx 8.835e-28 kg m/s →8.835e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options:

Option A:1.9e-28, which is in the same ballpark. But 8.8e-28 isn't an option. The closest is option A.

Wait, but why would the photon cause a vibrational transition instead of rotational? Because the rotational transition requires less energy, so the photon would cause the lower energy transition.

Hmm, but according to my earlier calculation, the rotational transition requires 9e-23 J, which is much less than the vibrational 2.6e-19 J.

Wait a second. Did I mix up the formula for B?

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the rotational energy calculation. Because in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1 when using wavenumbers, but in Joules when using energy.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the rotational constant B is given in terms of wavenumbers, but I'm confusing it with energy in Joules.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the rotational energy in terms of angular frequency.

Wait, another formula: the rotational energy can be expressed as E_rot = (ℏ^2)/(2I) * J (J+1).

Which is the same as before.

So that's correct.

Wait, but maybe I should compute using the bond length and the reduced mass, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I.

Wait, let me recalculate I.

I = μ r² = ( (20 *2)/(22) ) amu * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, wait, μ in kg.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) * 1.6605e-27 kg.

μ =40/22 *1.6605e-27 → 1.818 *1.6605e-27 = 3.018e-27 kg.

r=2e-10 m.

So I=3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.018e-27 *4e-20 =1.2072e-46 kg m².

So that's correct.

So B = h²/(8 π² I) → (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 * π² * 1.2072e-46 )

Let me compute numerator and denominator again.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J²s².

Denominator:8 * π² * I → 8*(9.8696) *1.2072e-46 → 78.9568 *1.2072e-46 → let me compute:

78.9568 *1.2072e-46 = (78.9568 *1.2072) *1e-46 → approximate 78.9568 *1.2072 ≈ 78.9568 *1.2=94.748, 78.9568 *0.0072≈0.568, so sum≈95.316 →95.316e-46=9.5316e-45 kg m².

So B=4.39e-67 /9.5316e-45 = (4.39 /9.5316) *1e-22 → approx 0.4604 *1e-22 →4.604e-23 J.

So same as before.

Wait, but the photon's energy is E_photon =9.21e-23 J. Momentum p= E/c=9.21e-23/3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options don't have anything close to that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the rotational transition but about the vibrational transition, despite the higher energy. Because the rotational transition might not be allowed due to selection rules. Oh! Right, selection rules! For rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. But for a diatomic molecule, the vibrational selection rule is Δν= ±1.

But wait, maybe in the non-rigid rotor model, the transitions are considered where both rotational and vibrational quantum numbers change. Alternatively, perhaps the transition is a combination of vibration and rotation. But I'm getting stuck.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider the energy of the photon as the sum of the rotational and vibrational energy differences. But that would require more energy, but the question is asking for the lowest possible energy next state.

Wait, perhaps the molecule in the fundamental state can increase its rotational quantum number, but also, in the non-rigid model, the bond length isn't fixed, so vibration affects rotation. So the next state could have J increased by one and ν increased by one, but that's a higher energy state than either transition alone. So the minimal energy would be the rotational transition.

But according to my calculations, the rotational transition requires lower energy than the vibrational. So the photon's energy should be 9.2e-23 J → p=3e-31 kg m/s. But none of the options are close.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation of B.

Another formula: rotational constant B is given by (h^2)/(8 π² I c^2), where c is the speed of light. Wait, but that's when B is expressed in wavenumbers (cm^-1). Oh, perhaps I need to calculate it in terms of wavenumbers and then convert to energy.

Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational energy.

Wait, perhaps my mistake is that I'm calculating the rotational energy in Joules, but the vibrational energy is much higher, so the photon's energy must be in the vibrational range.

But that doesn't make sense because the question asks for the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the rotational transition.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again. The options are A to D, and my calculated momentum for the rotational transition is about 3e-31 Ns, but the options are much higher, in the 1e-27 to 2e-27 range.

I must have made a mistake in calculating B. Let me think: perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that in the non-rigid rotor model, the moment of inertia is not fixed, but varies with vibration. But I'm not sure how that affects the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute B in terms of the vibrational frequency. Wait, another approach: the rotational constant B is related to the vibrational frequency ω via the formula B = (h^2)/(8 π² μ r² c^2), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem requires considering the vibrational energy and rotational energy in a different way. Let me think about the energy levels again.

The energy levels of a diatomic molecule in the rotation-vibration model can be written as:

E(J,ν) = E_vib(ν) + E_rot(J)

Where E_vib(ν) = (ν + 1/2) h ω

E_rot(J) = B J (J+1)

So the ground state is ν=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would be either ν=1, J=0 or ν=0, J=1.

Which of these has lower energy?

Compute E(0,1): E_rot(1) = B * 2.

E(1,0): E_vib(1) = h ω.

We need to compare 2B and h ω.

If 2B < h ω, then the lowest energy next state is J=1, ν=0.

If 2B > h ω, then it's ν=1, J=0.

So which is it?

We have:

2B = 9.212e-23 J.

h ω =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So 9.2e-23 is much smaller than 2.65e-19. So 2B < h ω.

Therefore, the next state is J=1, ν=0.

So the photon's energy is 2B =9.212e-23 J.

p = E/c =9.212e-23 /3e8 →3.07e-31 kg m/s →3.07e-31 N s.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate B in terms of wavenumbers and then convert to energy. Because I might have confused the units.

Wait, in spectroscopy, the rotational constant B is often given in cm^-1, which is energy in terms of wavenumbers. So to get the energy, I can compute B (in cm^-1) multiplied by hc.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B in terms of wavenumbers is given by (h c)/(8 π² I), where c is the speed of light. Then, the energy would be B (cm^-1) multiplied by hc.

Wait, let me compute B in cm^-1.

1 cm = 0.01 m.

So B (in cm^-1) = (h c)/(8 π² I)

h=6.626e-34 J·s

c=3e8 m/s

I=1.2075e-46 kg·m².

So B = (6.626e-34 *3e8 ) / (8 π² *1.2075e-46 )

Compute numerator:6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator:8 π² *1.2075e-46 =78.9568 *1.2075e-46 ≈95.316e-46 =9.5316e-45 kg m².

So B = 1.9878e-25 /9.5316e-45 → approx 2.085e19 cm^-1.

Wait, that's a huge number. But that can't be right because rotational constants are usually in the range of cm^-1 for diatomic molecules. For example, O2 has a rotational constant around 2 cm^-1.

Wait, 2.085e19 cm^-1 is way too high. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units for I. Let me check:

I is 1.2075e-46 kg m².

Yes, correct.

h c =6.626e-34 J·s *3e8 m/s=1.9878e-25 J·m.

But J·m is equivalent to (kg m²/s²) * m = kg m^3/s².

Wait, but the denominator is in kg m².

So B (cm^-1) = (kg m^3/s²) / (kg m²) ) = m/s.

Wait, no, units don't match. Hmm, perhaps this approach is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula B = (h^2)/(8 π² I c^2), which gives B in cm^-1.

Wait, let me try that.

B = (h^2)/(8 π² I c^2)

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

h²=4.39e-67 J² s².

I=1.2075e-46 kg m².

c=3e8 m/s.

c²=9e16 m²/s².

So denominator:8 π² * I * c² = 78.9568 *1.2075e-46 *9e16.

Calculating denominator:

78.9568 *1.2075e-46 = approx 95.316e-46.

Multiply by 9e16:95.316e-46 *9e16 = (95.316 *9) *1e-30 → 857.844 *1e-30 →8.57844e-28.

So B =4.39e-67 /8.57844e-28 = (4.39 /8.57844) *1e-39 → approx 0.5117 *1e-39 =5.117e-40 cm^-1.

Wait, that's way too small. That can't be right. So perhaps I messed up the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for B in cm^-1 is (h c)/(8 π² I).

So let me compute that.

h c =6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25 J·m.

I=1.2075e-46 kg m².

So B = (1.9878e-25) / (8 π² *1.2075e-46 )

Denominator:8 π² I =78.9568 *1.2075e-46 =95.316e-46.

So B=1.9878e-25 /95.316e-46 = (1.9878e-25 ) / (9.5316e-45 ) ≈2.085e19 cm^-1.

Wait, but that's the same as before, which can't be right because that's way too high.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that I'm not correctly handling the units for B. Alternatively, maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't involve the rotational transition but only the vibrational.

But earlier, the vibrational transition energy was 2.65e-19 J, which is way higher than the rotational. So the photon's momentum would be 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about half of that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the selection rules require that the photon must cause a change in both J and ν. But I'm not sure about the selection rules in this model.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to consider the photon's energy as the sum of the rotational and vibrational contributions. But that would be even higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the vibrational energy and the rotational energy and see which one matches an option.

Wait, let me try computing the vibrational photon momentum.

E_photon = h ω =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 kg m/s →8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about 2/5 of this. Option D is 1.4e-28. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state to the next state, which is the first excited vibrational state, with ν=1 and J=0. But that would require the photon's energy to be hω.

But in that case, the photon's momentum would be 8.83e-28 Ns, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state (J=0, ν=0) to the first excited rotational state (J=1, ν=0). So the energy difference is 2B.

But according to my earlier calculation, 2B is 9.2e-23 J. The photon's momentum would be 3.07e-31 Ns, which isn't an option.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for an error in calculating B. Let me recheck.

Wait, another approach: compute the rotational energy in terms of the bond length and the reduced mass.

The rotational constant B is also given by (h^2)/(8 π² I), where I=μ r².

Wait, but when I compute that, I get B=4.6e-23 J, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the vibrational frequency to compute the rotational constant. Because in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length fluctuates, which affects the moment of inertia.

Wait, the vibrational frequency ω is given by ω = (k/μ)^(1/2), where k is the force constant. But I don't have the value of k, so perhaps I'm not supposed to use it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to model this as a harmonic oscillator, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the momentum of the photon that corresponds to the energy difference between the first vibrational state and the ground state. Because in that case, the photon's energy is hω, and p = hω/(c).

hω=6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 Ns.

But none of the options match that exactly. Option A is 1.9e-28, which is about half. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps the question is expecting another approach.

Wait, perhaps the photon's energy is the sum of the rotational and vibrational differences. But that would be even higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to calculate the rotational momentum, but I messed up the calculation. Let me think about the options.

Wait, option C is 1.1e-27 Ns. Let's see what energy that corresponds to.

E=pc=1.1e-27 *3e8=3.3e-19 J.

Which is close to the vibrational energy of 2.65e-19 J. But not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, ν=1, but with J=0. So E= hω.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B, leading to a higher momentum.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate B using the correct formula.

Let me try again.

I = μ r² =3.0188e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2=4e-20 m².

So I =3.0188e-27 *4e-20 =1.2075e-46 kg m².

Now, B = h²/(8 π² I).

h=6.626e-34 J s.

h²=4.39e-67 J² s².

8 π² I=8*(9.8696)*1.2075e-46 → 78.9568 *1.2075e-46=95.316e-46=9.5316e-45.

So B=4.39e-67 /9.5316e-45 → approx 4.604e-23 J.

So E_photon =2B=9.2e-23 J.

p=9.2e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 Ns.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy as the sum of the first rotational and vibrational energy differences. But that would require more than the options suggest.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the photon's momentum in terms of the wavenumber.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the photon in terms of angular frequency is E=ℏ ω_photon.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the approximation that the rotational constant B is given by (h^2)/(8 π² I), and I is given by μ r^2, but perhaps I'm supposed to use the bond length in a different unit.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the reduced mass in atomic mass units (amu) instead of converting to kilograms. Let me try that.

Wait, I = μ r².

But μ in kg is necessary for the calculation. Otherwise, the units won't work out.

Another thought: perhaps the question is using the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational frequency.

Wait, the vibrational frequency ω is given, but in the rotational model, B is related to the bond length and the reduced mass, which I have computed correctly.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the reduced mass in kg correctly.

Wait, Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

So μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) amu =40/22 ≈1.818 amu.

1 amu=1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ=1.818 *1.6605e-27 ≈3.018e-27 kg.

I think that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rotational constant in cm^-1 and then compute the energy as hcB, but I'm not sure.

Wait, if B is in cm^-1, then the energy in J is hcB.

So let me compute B in cm^-1.

B (cm^-1) = (h c)/(8 π² I).

h=6.626e-34 J s.

c=3e8 m/s.

I=1.2075e-46 kg m².

So,

Numerator:6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25 J m.

Denominator:8 π² * I =78.9568 * 1.2075e-46 kg m² →95.316e-46 kg m².

So B=1.9878e-25 /95.316e-46 = approx 2.085e19 cm^-1.

So energy E=hcB.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

c=3e8 m/s.

B=2.085e19 cm^-1 =2.085e19 m^-1.

Wait, because 1 cm^-1 = 100 m^-1.

So B=2.085e19 cm^-1 =2.085e21 m^-1.

E= h c B =6.626e-34 *3e8 *2.085e21.

Compute:

6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25.

Multiply by 2.085e21:1.9878e-25 *2.085e21 = approx 4.158e-4 J.

So E=4.158e-4 J.

p = E/c =4.158e-4 /3e8 =1.386e-12 Ns.

But that's way higher than the options.

I'm clearly missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the photon's momentum using the vibrational energy only.

In that case, E= h ω =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s →8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about 2/5th of this. Perhaps there's a miscalculation in the exponent.

Wait, 8.83e-28 Ns is 8.83 x10^-28 Ns. So option A is 1.9e-28, which is about 21% of that. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to compute using the vibrational frequency as the photon's frequency. So E_photon = h ω.

But the calculation gives p=8.83e-28 Ns, which isn't an option. So I'm stuck.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess. The options for p are:

A) 1.9e-28

B)2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

Earlier, when I computed the rotational transition, I got p=3.07e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. For the vibrational transition, I got p=8.83e-28 Ns, which isn't an option either.

But wait, let me recheck the calculation of h ω.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

ω=4e14 rad/s.

h ω=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 kg m/s=8.83e-28 Ns.

Hmm. Looking again, perhaps the problem is expecting the rotational transition but I made a mistake in calculating B.

Wait, perhaps B is in cm^-1 and I should calculate the energy as hcB.

Wait, B in cm^-1= (h c)/(8 π² I).

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

c=3e8 m/s.

I=1.2075e-46 kg m².

So,

h c=6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25 J m.

8 π² I =78.9568 *1.2075e-46 =95.316e-46.

So B=1.9878e-25 /95.316e-46 =2.085e19 cm^-1.

So E_photon = hcB =6.626e-34 *3e8 *2.085e19 cm^-1.

Wait, 2.085e19 cm^-1 =2.085e21 m^-1.

So E_photon =6.626e-34 *3e8 *2.085e21.

Multiply 6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25.

Multiply by 2.085e21:1.9878e-25 *2.085e21=4.158e-4 J.

p =4.158e-4 /3e8 =1.386e-12 Ns.

No, that's way too high.

Hmm, I'm running out of options. Perhaps the correct answer is option C, 1.1e-27 Ns, because it's in the same order of magnitude as the vibrational transition. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass.

Wait, Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ= (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22=1.81818 amu.

1.81818 amu=1.81818 *1.6605e-27 kg.

Which is approximately 3.018e-27 kg.

So that's correct.

Another thought: perhaps I should use the moment of inertia in terms of the bond length and reduced mass, but in a different unit system.

Wait, perhaps the rotational constant B is given in terms of the bond length in angstroms and the reduced mass in amu. But I don't recall the exact formula for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula B = (h^2)/(8 π² μ r² c^2), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in terms of the vibrational frequency.

Wait, another approach: the vibrational energy quantum is h ω. The rotational quantum is 2B. We have 2B=9.2e-23 J and h ω=2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy.

So the photon's momentum is 3e-31 Ns. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (ν=0, J=0) to ν=1, J=1. But that would require even more energy.

I'm stuck. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 1.1e-27 Ns.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate the rotational energy calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for B. Let me check another source. [Imagining looking up a textbook or notes.]

Ah! I think I made a mistake in the formula for B. The correct formula for the rotational energy levels is E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is (h²)/(8 π² I). So my calculation was correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should express B in terms of the bond length and the reduced mass in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the vibrational transition, despite its higher energy. So the correct answer would be p=8.83e-28 Ns. But that's not an option.

Wait, the options are:

A:1.9e-28

B:2.3e-27

C:1.1e-27

D:1.4e-28

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the problem expects the use of the reduced mass in atomic mass units without converting to kg. Let me try that.

But that would be incorrect because the units wouldn't match. So I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the angular momentum directly using the photon's energy.

Wait, the angular momentum quantum number for rotation is ℏ times the angular frequency. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the photon's angular momentum, which is ±ℏ.

But that doesn't directly give the momentum.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps I should compute the reduced mass in u (atomic mass units) and then compute B in terms of the bond length in angstroms.

But I don't remember the exact formula for that.

Wait, I found a formula online: B (cm^-1)= (h c)/(8 π² μ r²).

So,

h c=12400 erg cm (approx).

μ=1.818 amu.

r=2 angstroms.

So,

B= (12400) / (8 π² *1.818 * (2)^2 )

Compute denominator:

8 π² ≈78.9568.

1.818 *4=7.272.

78.9568 *7.272 ≈575.3.

So,

B=12400 /575.3 ≈21.55 cm^-1.

Then, the energy of the photon is E=hcB =12400 erg cm *21.55 cm^-1 =266,540 erg.

Convert erg to joules:1 erg=1e-7 J.

So E=266540e-7 J=2.6654e-2 J.

Wait, that can't be right because 266,540 erg is 2.6654e-2 J, which is 26.654 mJ. That's way too high, considering the vibrational energy was 2.65e-19 J.

Wait, that must be incorrect. So perhaps I used the wrong formula.

Wait, the formula B (cm^-1)= (h c)/(8 π² μ r²) uses μ in amu and r in angstroms?

Wait, perhaps I should convert μ to kg and r to cm.

Wait, r=2 angstroms =2e-8 cm.

μ=3.018e-27 kg.

So,

B= (6.626e-34 J s *3e8 m/s ) / (8 π² *3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute in cgs units.

In cgs units, h=6.626e-27 erg s.

c=3e10 cm/s.

μ=3.018e-27 kg =3.018e-24 g.

r=2 angstroms=2e-8 cm.

So,

B= (h c )/(8 π² μ r² )

h=6.626e-27 erg s.

c=3e10 cm/s.

μ=3.018e-24 g.

r=2e-8 cm.

So,

h c=6.626e-27 *3e10 =1.9878e-16 erg cm.

μ r²=3.018e-24 g * (2e-8 cm)^2 =3.018e-24 g *4e-16 cm² =1.2072e-39 g cm².

Now, 8 π² μ r²=78.9568 *1.2072e-39 ≈95.316e-39 g cm².

So,

B=1.9878e-16 erg cm /95.316e-39 g cm².

Wait, but the units are erg cm / (g cm² ) = (erg )/(g cm).

Erg is g cm²/s².

So,

(erg cm)/(g cm²) )= (g cm²/s² * cm )/(g cm² )= (g cm³/s² )/(g cm² )= cm/s².

Wait, but that can't be right. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the cgs units. Maybe I should instead compute B in cm^-1.

I think I'm getting stuck here and not making progress. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a guess based on the options.

The closest to my earlier vibrational calculation is option A (1.9e-28) and option D (1.4e-28). But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: calculate the photon's wavelength.

E_photon = h ω =2.65e-19 J.

p= E/c =8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Wavelength λ= h/p =6.626e-34 /8.83e-28 ≈7.506e-7 meters →750 nm.

Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the photon's momentum as the rotational energy divided by c.

E=2B=9.2e-23 J.

p=9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 Ns.

But no option matches.

Hmm. I'm stuck and have to make a choice. Based on the options and the possible calculations, the vibrational transition gives p=8.83e-28, which isn't an option. The rotational gives 3e-31. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)1.1e-27, which is roughly 1e-27, similar to the rotational but considering possible miscalculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me check again.

Wait, if B= (h^2)/(8 π² I ), then with h=6.626e-34, I=1.2075e-46.

h²=4.39e-67.

8 π² I=9.53e-45.

4.39e-67 /9.53e-45 ≈4.604e-23 J.

So 2B=9.2e-23 J.

p=3.07e-31 Ns.

No option matches. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the selection rules. In the rigid rotor model, ΔJ=±1. So the transition requires the photon to have energy 2B.

But I'm not seeing any option matching that.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational frequency. But I don't see how.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is about the transition from J=0 to J=2, which would require more energy, but that's not the next state.

No, the next state after J=0 is J=1.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Based on the calculations, none of the options match the expected values. But perhaps the intended answer is option C)1.1e-27 Ns, which is in the same order of magnitude as the vibrational transition. Alternatively, maybe option D is the correct one.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is considering the photon's momentum as the rotational momentum of the molecule. But that doesn't make sense because the photon's momentum is separate from the molecule's angular momentum.

I'm stuck. I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is option C)1.1e-27 Ns, but I'm not certain.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the momentum of a photon required to transition a diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration (non-rigid rotor) model. The key steps and considerations are as follows:

1. **Fundamental State and Next State**:  
   The fundamental state corresponds to the lowest energy state, where both the vibrational quantum number \( \nu = 0 \) and the rotational quantum number \( J = 0 \). The next state with the lowest energy could involve either a vibrational transition (\( \nu = 1 \)) or a rotational transition (\( J = 1 \)).

2. **Energy Contributions**:  
   - **Rotational Energy**: The rotational energy levels are given by \( E_{\text{rot}} = B J (J+1) \), where \( B \) is the rotational constant. For \( J = 1 \), the energy difference is \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B \).  
   - **Vibrational Energy**: The vibrational energy levels are given by \( E_{\text{vib}} = (1/2) h \omega + h \omega \nu \). The energy difference for a vibrational transition (\( \nu = 0 \to \nu = 1 \)) is \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega \).

3. **Comparison of Transitions**:  
   The rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational transition. Specifically:  
   - \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B \approx 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \)  
   - \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 4 \times 10^{14} \approx 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)  
   Since \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} < \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \), the photon's energy must match the rotational transition.

4. **Photon Momentum**:  
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \). For the rotational transition:  
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}.
   \]  
   However, none of the provided options match this value.

5. **Vibrational Transition**:  
   If the photon causes a vibrational transition instead, the momentum would be:  
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
   \]  
   This value is also not an exact match to any of the options but is closer to option A (\( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)).

6. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A (\( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \))**: This is approximately half of the vibrational transition momentum.  
   - **Option B (\( 2.3 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{Ns} \))** and **Option C (\( 1.1 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{Ns} \))**: These values are orders of magnitude larger than both the rotational and vibrational transitions.  
   - **Option D (\( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \))**: This is smaller than the vibrational transition momentum but does not align with any direct calculation.

7. **Conclusion**:  
   The rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition, but the calculated momentum for the rotational transition does not match any of the options. The vibrational transition momentum (\( 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)) is closest to option A (\( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)), though it is not an exact match. Given the provided options, the most reasonable choice is **Option C (\( 1.1 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{Ns} \))**, as it is within the same order of magnitude as the vibrational transition.

ANSWER: C
