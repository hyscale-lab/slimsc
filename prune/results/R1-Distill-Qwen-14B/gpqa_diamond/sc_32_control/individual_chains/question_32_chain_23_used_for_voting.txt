Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, right? And the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus is. Li usually has 3 protons, but if it has 3 neutrons, the isotope would be Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. Wait, or is it Li-7? No, no. Wait, the atomic number of lithium is 3. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so it's 6 on the periodic table. So the mass is that of a Li-6 nucleus.

But wait, the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li normally has 3 protons. So 3 protons + 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. So the mass is approximately the mass of a Li-6 nucleus.

I think the formula for the energy in a particle accelerator is the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy. But wait, in colliders, sometimes they talk about the kinetic energy, but I think in this context, since it's given as the energy of the collider, it's probably the total energy (gamma * m * c²) that's required.

Wait, but wait. Wait, in accelerators, the kinetic energy is often what's given, but sometimes the total energy is what's used. I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The speed is given as 0.96c. So we can calculate the Lorentz factor gamma.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So plugging in v = 0.96c, let's compute that.

v squared is (0.96c)^2. So 1 - (0.96)^2 is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216, so 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.57142857.

So gamma is about 3.5714. Now, the energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy of the nucleus.

But what is the rest mass energy of a Li-6 nucleus? Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of approximately 938 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 6 nucleons, the mass is 6 * 938 MeV/c². Wait, but wait, the mass of the nucleus is slightly less than the sum of individual protons and neutrons due to binding energy. However, since the problem might be using the mass as if it's just 6 nucleons, perhaps we can approximate it as 6 * 938 MeV.

Wait, but wait again. Let me think: the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6, 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So the mass would be 3*(938) + 3*(939.565) MeV/c².

Let me calculate that: 3*938 = 2814, and 3*939.565 = 2818.695. So total is 2814 + 2818.695 = 5632.695 MeV/c². Hmm, that's 5632.695 MeV, which is 5.632695 GeV.

Wait, but wait. I recall that the mass of a nucleus is a bit less than the sum of the individual nucleons because of the mass defect (E=mc², binding energy). So the actual mass would be (sum of individual masses) - mass defect. But for the sake of this problem, perhaps the approximation of 6 * 938 MeV is acceptable? Or should we use a more precise value?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass as 6 * 938 MeV. Let me proceed with that approximation first.

So the rest mass energy is approximately 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

So the total energy is gamma multiplied by this rest mass energy.

Gamma is about 3.5714, so 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV.

Let me compute that: 3.5 *5.628 is 19.698. But 0.0714 *5.628= approx 0.403. So total is approx 20.101 GeV.

Wait, but let me calculate more accurately. 3.5714 *5.628.

3.5714 *5 = 17.857.

3.5714 *0.628 = approx let's compute 3.5714 *0.6 = 2.14284, and 3.5714 *0.028 = 0.0999992, so total approx 2.2428.

So total is 17.857 +2.2428 = 20.1 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. Option D is 21.419, which is higher. Option B is ~23, A is ~18.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I made a mistake here. Because in high-energy physics, when they talk about the energy of the collider, sometimes they refer to the kinetic energy, not the total energy. But in this case, the question says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." Hmm. So velocity is given. So we need to find the energy that gives this speed.

Wait, the speed is given, so the energy is the total energy, which is gamma times rest mass energy. Because kinetic energy is (gamma-1) mc². But if the question is about the energy of the collider, it's the kinetic energy that is imparted. So maybe I should calculate the kinetic energy instead.

Wait, but the question says, "what is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So perhaps it's the total energy, because the speed is a function of the total energy. Wait, but speed is determined by the kinetic energy as well. So maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the speed is given, so maybe the problem requires the total energy, because the speed depends on the gamma factor, which comes from the total energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy in the context of the collider is the kinetic energy. So, which is it? Let's think.

In particle accelerators, the kinetic energy is usually what's quoted. For example, the LHC runs at a certain energy, which is the kinetic energy. So if the speed is given, perhaps we need to compute the kinetic energy. But wait, speed depends on the total energy, so the problem might be expecting the total energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy given is the kinetic energy. Let me clarify.

The speed v is 0.96c. The gamma factor is 3.5714 as before.

The total energy is gamma * m c².

The kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) * m c².

So, if the question is about the kinetic energy, then we have to compute (gamma -1) * m c².

Wait, but in the problem statement, the question is phrased as "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So the energy that gives that speed would be the total energy, because the speed is based on the kinetic energy imparted.

Wait, but speed is a function of the kinetic energy. Let me think: The kinetic energy K = (gamma-1) m c².

So, K = (gamma-1) m c².

But since v = 0.96c, we can find gamma as before, which is 3.5714.

So the kinetic energy is (3.5714 -1) * m c² = 2.5714 * m c².

Wait, so the total energy is gamma m c² = 3.5714 * m c², and the kinetic is 2.5714 * m c².

So the question is, which energy are they asking for? The problem says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." Hmm, I think RHIC's energy is given as the kinetic energy. Because when you accelerate particles, the kinetic energy is what you impart to them.

Wait, but in reality, sometimes colliders specify their energy as the total energy. For example, the LHC's energy is given as the total proton energy (like 6.5 TeV per proton in Run 2), which includes the rest mass. Since protons are already moving close to c, their rest mass is negligible compared to their kinetic energy, so sometimes it's approximated as kinetic energy. But for heavy ions like Li-6, the rest mass is significant, so the total energy is gamma times the rest mass.

But in the problem, they're asking for the energy of the RHIC. RHIC's energy is usually given as the total energy per ion. For example, RHIC can collide heavy ions at up to 100 GeV per nucleon. Wait, but wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think RHIC's maximum energy is about 100 GeV per nucleon. So for a nucleus with A nucleons, the total energy would be A * 100 GeV? No, wait, no. Wait, the energy per nucleon is 100 GeV, so the total energy per nucleus would be A * 100 GeV.

But Li-6 has 6 nucleons, so 6 * 100 GeV = 600 GeV. But the options given are all around 18-23 GeV, so much lower than that. So perhaps the problem is not about RHIC's maximum energy, but a specific scenario where the speed is 0.96c.

Hmm. But let's proceed.

So going back, the problem is to find the energy of RHIC when the speed is 0.96c.

So, first, compute gamma, which is about 3.5714.

Then, find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus.

So, as before, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

The mass of a proton is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c².

So the total rest mass energy of Li-6 is:

3 * 938.272 + 3 * 939.565 = Let's compute this.

3*(938.272) = 2814.816 MeV.

3*(939.565) = 2818.695 MeV.

Total = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.633511 GeV.

So m c² is about 5.6335 GeV.

Now, the total energy is gamma multiplied by this.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So:

Total energy E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 * 5.6335 GeV.

Let me compute this accurately.

3.57142857 * 5.6335.

Let me compute step by step.

First, 3 *5.6335 = 16.9005.

0.57142857 *5.6335:

Compute 0.5 *5.6335 = 2.81675.

0.07142857 *5.6335 ≈ 0.4036 (since 5.6335 * 0.07 is 0.3943, and 0.00142857 *5.6335 ≈0.0081, so total approx 0.4024).

So 2.81675 + 0.4024 ≈ 3.21915.

So total E is approx 16.9005 +3.21915 = 20.11965 GeV.

Hmm, about 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

But wait, perhaps I approximated the gamma too roughly. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

Yes.

But perhaps I should calculate it more precisely. Let me compute 1/0.28.

0.28 = 28/100 = 7/25. So 1/(7/25)=25/7 ≈3.57142857.

So that's correct.

So the product is 3.57142857 *5.6335 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass energy is more precise. Let me compute the exact value of the mass of Li-6.

Wait, maybe I should get the exact value of the mass of Li-6. Because using 938 MeV for a proton is an approximation. The actual masses are:

Proton: 938.272 MeV/c².

Neutron: 939.565 MeV/c².

So Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So:

3 *938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.

3 *939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.

Total: 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.633511 GeV.

So more accurately, m c² is 5.633511 GeV.

Then, gamma is 25/7 ≈3.57142857.

So E = (25/7) *5.633511 GeV.

Compute 25/7 *5.633511.

Let me compute 25 *5.633511 = 140.837775.

Then divide by 7: 140.837775 /7 ≈20.119682 GeV.

So approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 20.1197 rounded to four decimal places would be 20.1197, which is 20.1197, which is approximately 20.1197 GeV. But the options have C as 20.132, which is a bit higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma more accurately, but I think 3.5714 is accurate enough.

Wait another thought: Is the nucleus moving at 0.96c, so its kinetic energy is (gamma-1) m c², which would be (3.5714 -1) *5.6335 GeV.

That's 2.5714 *5.6335 GeV.

Compute 2.5714 *5.6335.

2 *5.6335=11.267.

0.5714 *5.6335.

Let me compute 0.5714 = 4/7 approximately.

So 5.6335 *4/7 = (5.6335 *4)/7 ≈22.534 /7 ≈3.219.

So total KE would be 11.267 +3.219 =14.486 GeV.

But the options are all above 18 GeV, so that can't be the case.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the energy of the collider, which is the total energy, not the kinetic. So the 20 GeV figure is correct, which matches option C, 20.132 GeV.

But wait, why is my initial calculation leading to about 20.1197 GeV, and option C is 20.132? Hmm, perhaps I need to calculate more precisely.

Let me compute 25/7 *5.633511 precisely.

Compute 5.633511 *25 = 140.837775.

Then divide by 7: 140.837775 /7.

7 *20=140.

So 140.837775 -140 =0.837775.

0.837775 /7 = approx 0.11968.

So 20.11968 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Wait, but the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 20.132.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass was calculated with more precise figures.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is more accurately known. Let me check.

Wait, the exact mass of Li-6 is about 5.639245 GeV/c², perhaps. Because I might have used approximate values for the proton and neutron masses.

Wait, let me get the exact masses:

Proton: 938.272 MeV/c².

Neutron: 939.56556 MeV/c².

So for Li-6, 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

3*(938.272)=2814.816 MeV.

3*(939.56556)= 2818.69668 MeV.

Total: 2814.816 +2818.69668 =5633.51268 MeV.

So m c² is 5633.51268 MeV =5.63351268 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² = (25/7) *5.63351268 GeV.

25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 *5.63351268 = ?

Let me compute this more precisely.

5.63351268 * 3 =16.90053804

0.57142857 *5.63351268 = ?

Compute 5.63351268 *0.5=2.81675634

5.63351268 *0.07142857.

Wait, 0.07142857 is 1/14.

So 5.63351268 * (1/14) = 0.402393763.

So 0.5 *5.63351268 =2.81675634.

0.07142857 *5.63351268 ≈ 0.40239376.

So 2.81675634 +0.40239376 =3.2191501.

So total E is 16.90053804 +3.2191501 =20.11968814 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 20.132, which is a bit higher than 20.1197.

Hmm, perhaps I missed a more precise calculation of gamma. Let me calculate gamma more accurately.

Since v =0.96c, v²= (0.96)^2 c²=0.9216 c².

So 1 -v²/c²= 1 -0.9216= 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

But wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let's compute 1/sqrt(0.0784) accurately.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, because 0.28^2=0.0784.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.571428571428571...

So no, that's exact. So no error there.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass. Let me think, maybe the actual mass of Li-6 is slightly higher due to binding energy. Oh wait, no. The binding energy is subtracted, so the actual mass is less than the sum of individual nucleons. So perhaps I miscalculated. Wait, but I used the sum, but the actual mass is less. Hence, my calculation would overestimate the rest mass energy.

Wait, no. Because the rest mass is sum of individual nucleons minus binding energy. So the actual mass is less than 5.634 GeV, which would make the total energy less than 20.12 GeV. So if the options have 20.132, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the exact value of the mass of Li-6. Let me look up the exact value.

Wait, but I can't actually look it up right now, but I can recall that the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 5.639245 u (unified atomic mass units). Because 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c².

So mass of Li-6 is 5.639245 u * 931.5 MeV/c²/u.

Let me compute that:

5.639245 *931.5 = ?

5 *931.5=4657.5.

0.639245 *931.5.

0.6 *931.5=558.9

0.039245 *931.5 ≈ 36.54.

So 558.9 +36.54 =595.44.

So total 4657.5 +595.44 =5252.94 MeV.

Wait, that's 5.25294 GeV.

Wait, but earlier I had 5.6335 GeV. That's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the atomic mass.

Wait, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 5.639245 u. So 5.639245 *931.5 MeV/c² =5.639245 *0.9315 GeV.

Wait, 5.639245 *0.9315 = ?

Let me compute that.

5 *0.9315=4.6575.

0.639245 *0.9315.

0.6 *0.9315=0.5589.

0.039245 *0.9315 ≈0.03654.

So 0.5589 +0.03654=0.59544.

Adding to 4.6575, gives 5.25294 GeV.

Wait, that's different from my previous calculation. So according to this, the rest mass is about 5.25294 GeV.

Wait, that would change the entire calculation.

So if m c² is 5.25294 GeV, then E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.25294 GeV.

Compute that:

3 *5.25294 =15.75882.

0.57142857 *5.25294.

0.5 *5.25294=2.62647.

0.07142857 *5.25294 ≈0.3745.

So sum is 2.62647 +0.3745 ≈3.00097.

So total E=15.75882 +3.00097 ≈18.7598 GeV.

Wait, that's about 18.76 GeV. Looking at the options, option A is 18.475 GeV, option C is 20.132.

Hmm, this is conflicting. Now I'm confused because I have two different values for the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify the mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

The mass of a single Li-6 atom is approximately 5.639245 u. But when considering the nucleus, we have to subtract the mass of the electrons. Li has 3 electrons, each about 0.00054858 u. So 3 *0.00054858≈0.00164574 u.

So the mass of the nucleus is 5.639245 u -0.00164574 u ≈5.6376 u.

Ah, right, because the atomic mass includes the electrons. So the nuclear mass is 5.6376 u.

So 5.6376 u *931.5 MeV/u =5.6376 *0.9315 GeV.

Let me compute that: 5 *0.9315=4.6575.

0.6376 *0.9315.

0.6 *0.9315=0.5589.

0.0376 *0.9315≈0.03505.

So 0.5589 +0.03505=0.59395.

So total is 4.6575 +0.59395=5.25145 GeV.

So the rest mass energy is approximately 5.25145 GeV.

So then the total energy E = gamma * m c² =3.5714 *5.25145.

Compute that:

3 *5.25145=15.75435.

0.5714 *5.25145.

0.5 *5.25145=2.625725.

0.0714 *5.25145≈0.3743.

So sum is 2.625725 +0.3743=3.000025.

So E=15.75435 +3.000025≈18.754375 GeV.

Which is approximately 18.7544 GeV.

The options don't have 18.75, but option A is 18.475, which is a bit lower.

Hmm, so this suggests that the correct answer is around 18.75 GeV, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in using the rest mass of the nucleus.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6 times the mass of a nucleon, but adjusted for binding energy.

Wait, the mass of Li-6 is given as approximately 5.639245 u, which includes the electrons. So the nuclear mass is 5.639245 u minus 3 * electron mass.

Electron mass is about 0.00054858 u per electron. So 3 electrons would be 0.00164574 u.

So nuclear mass =5.639245 u -0.00164574 u =5.6376 u.

So nuclear mass is 5.6376 u *931.5 MeV/u =5.6376 *931.5 = let's compute that.

5.6376 *931.5 = ?

5 *931.5 =4657.5.

0.6376 *931.5 =0.6 *931.5=558.9, 0.0376 *931.5≈35.06.

So 558.9 +35.06=593.96.

Total 4657.5 +593.96=5251.46 MeV =5.25146 GeV.

So m c² is 5.25146 GeV.

E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.25146.

Let me compute that precisely.

3.57142857 *5.25146.

Compute 3 *5.25146=15.75438.

0.57142857 *5.25146 = ?

0.5 *5.25146=2.62573.

0.07142857 *5.25146 ≈ 0.3743.

So sum is 2.62573 +0.3743=3.00003.

So total E=15.75438 +3.00003=18.75441 GeV.

So about 18.7544 GeV.

But the options don't have this; the closest is option C (20.132) and option A (18.475).

Hmm, but wait, perhaps the problem is using the mass of a single nucleon as 938 MeV, so 6 *938=5628 MeV =5.628 GeV.

So if the rest mass is 5.628 GeV, then E=3.5714 *5.628=?

3 *5.628=16.884.

0.5714 *5.628=3.209.

So total 16.884+3.209=20.093 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.093 GeV, close to option C, 20.132 GeV.

But earlier, using the accurate nuclear mass, I got about 18.75 GeV, which isn't an option. So perhaps the problem expects me to use the approximate mass, 6 *938 MeV.

So with that, E=3.5714 *5.628≈20.093 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact value using the precise gamma and rest mass.

So let's compute 3.57142857 *5.628 GeV.

5.628 *3.57142857.

5.628 *3 =16.884.

5.628 *0.57142857=?

5.628 *0.5=2.814.

5.628 *0.07142857≈5.628 *0.07143=approx 0.403.

So 2.814 +0.403=3.217.

So total is 16.884 +3.217=20.0999, about 20.10 GeV.

So option C is 20.132, which is very close.

But why is there a discrepancy between the two methods (using approximate and accurate nuclear mass)?

Because using the accurate nuclear mass, including the binding energy, gives a lower value, but perhaps the problem expects the approximate calculation without considering the binding energy.

Therefore, I think the intended answer is option C, 20.132 GeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is equal to \( 0.96c \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Relativistic Energy Formula**:  
   The total energy of a particle is given by \( E = \gamma m c^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). For \( v = 0.96c \),  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714.
   \]

2. **Rest Mass Energy of Li-6**:  
   The Li-6 nucleus consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using approximate nucleon masses (\( m_p \approx 938 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), \( m_n \approx 939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)), the total rest mass energy is:  
   \[
   m c^2 = 3 m_p + 3 m_n = 3(938) + 3(939.565) = 2814 + 2818.695 = 5632.695 \, \text{MeV} = 5.632695 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]

3. **Total Energy Calculation**:  
   Substituting \( \gamma \approx 3.5714 \) and \( m c^2 \approx 5.632695 \, \text{GeV} \) into the relativistic energy formula:  
   \[
   E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.632695 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]  
   Breaking this into components:  
   \[
   3 \times 5.632695 = 16.898085, \quad 0.5714 \times 5.632695 \approx 3.219.
   \]  
   Adding these gives:  
   \[
   E \approx 16.898085 + 3.219 = 20.117 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated energy (\( \approx 20.117 \, \text{GeV} \)) is closest to option **C (20.132 GeV)**. Other options are significantly farther:  
   - **A (18.475 GeV)**: Too low.  
   - **B (23.069 GeV)**: Too high.  
   - **D (21.419 GeV)**: Slightly higher than the calculated value.

Thus, the energy of the RHIC required for the Li-6 nucleus to reach \( 0.96c \) is approximately **20.132 GeV**.
