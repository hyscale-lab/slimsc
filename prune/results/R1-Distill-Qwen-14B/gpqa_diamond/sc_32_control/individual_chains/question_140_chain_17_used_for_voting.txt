Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully and breaking down the information given.

So, the question talks about Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Then, it reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. A precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. The melting point of B under normal conditions is close to 277 K. 

Another point is that the product of a certain keto acid reacting with Substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Also, Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X.

Hmm. Let's try to piece this together.

First, I need to identify what Substance X could be. Since it's used as a reagent in organic chemistry and reacts with a liquid, perhaps it's a strong base or something like that. Wait, the reaction is violent, so it's probably a strong base reacting with an acid. Oh wait, but liquid Y is the other reactant. Maybe Y is water? Or perhaps another liquid like ethanol or something else.

When X reacts with Y, it releases gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about possible gases. If the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, let's consider the possibilities. Let's take the simplest case where W is H2O. Wait, but H2O has H and O. H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in the most common isotope. But wait, the molecule as a whole—each molecule. So each H2O molecule has (2 H atoms: 1p each, 0n each) and O: 8p, 8n. So total protons per molecule: 2*1 +8=10. Neutrons: 2*0 +8=8. So 10 vs 8, which doesn't match. So that can't be.

Another option: CO2. Each molecule has 6p (C) + 2*8p (O) = 6 +16=22p. Neutrons: C usually has 6n, O has 8n each. So 6 + 16=22n. Oh, wait! That's equal. So CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So W could be CO2. Hmm. But wait, in that case, the molecule would have equal number of protons and neutrons. So that fits.

Wait, but the reaction between X and Y produces CO2. Let me think about what reactions produce CO2. If X is a carbonate, reacting with an acid, but then Y would be an acid. Or, if X is a metal, reacting with a carbonate? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe W is CH4? No, because CH4 has 4 H (each 1p) and C (6p). So total protons: 4 +6=10. Neutrons: C has 6, H has 0. So 6. So 10 vs 6, not equal.

Wait, another possibility. What about NH3? No, NH3 has 14p (N) and 3H (3p). Total p=17. Neutrons: N has 7n, H has 0. So 7. Not equal.

Wait, what about O2? Each O has 8p and 8n. So O2 would have 16p and 16n. That's equal. So gas W could be O2. But O2 is diatomic, so the molecule has 16p and 16n. That fits.

Another option is O3, but same idea.

Wait, but production of O2 as a gas from a reaction—does that make sense? Let's think about the reaction. If X is a metal, reacting with an acid (Y) to produce H2 gas. But H2 is H2, which has 2p and 2n (each H has 1p and 0n). So that's 2 vs 0. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: the gas W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think of elements where their atoms have equal protons and neutrons. For example, carbon-12 has 6p and 6n. Oxygen-16 has 8p and 8n. Chlorine-35 has 17p and 18n (no, 35-17=18 n). Wait, but if W is a molecule made of such atoms.

Wait, maybe W is CO. Let's see: each CO molecule has C (6p, 6n) and O (8p, 8n). So total protons: 6 +8=14. Neutrons: 6+8=14. So 14 each. That works. So W could be CO. Hmm. So gas W is CO.

So if X reacts with Y to produce CO, what could that be? Let me think of reactions that produce CO. One possibility is the thermal decomposition of a metal carbonate. For example, heating a metal carbonate can produce CO2, but maybe under certain conditions, it could produce CO. Alternatively, maybe a reaction between a metal and a weak acid leading to CO, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is hydrochloric acid. X could be a carbonate. Wait, but if X is a carbonate, reacting with HCl would produce CO2, not CO. Hmm. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe W is C. No, that's a solid. Wait, maybe W is a noble gas? For example, Xe has 54p and 76n (I think), so that wouldn't fit. Another noble gas? Doesn't seem likely.

Wait, perhaps W is CH3Cl or something else, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about another angle.

The precipitate G is formed when X reacts with Y. Then, when G is heated, it releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. Let me check what that is in Celsius. 277 K is about 30°C (since 273 K is 0°C, so 277-273=4 K → 4°C? Wait, wait, no: 277 K is 4°C? Wait, no, wait: 273 K is 0°C. So 277 K is 4°C? But that seems low. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating. 277 K is 277-273.15=3.85°C, around 4°C. Hmm.

Wait, another common melting point near 4°C is water. But that's its freezing point. Wait, perhaps B is a substance that melts around that temperature. Another possibility is something like ice, but that's solid water. Alternatively, perhaps B is a salt that has a low melting point.

Wait, but when G is heated, it releases B. So maybe G is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into B, which is a metal oxide or something else.

Wait, perhaps B is a metal oxide, which is solid and has a melting point around 4°C. Hmm, that seems unlikely because most metal oxides have higher melting points.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a carbonate? No, because if G is a carbonate, heating it might decompose into CO2 and the metal oxide.

Wait, maybe B is a basic oxide? Or perhaps it's a metal oxide that has a low melting point. Not sure.

Another point: the product of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Let me think about this. A keto acid is like a carboxylic acid, which has the -COOH group. When a carboxylic acid reacts with a base, it typically forms a salt and water. So if X is a base, and it reacts with a keto acid, the product would be a salt (with the conjugate base of the acid and the cation from X) and water.

The product (the salt) contains 2 oxygen atoms. Let me think about possible salts. For example, if X is a metal or ammonium, like NaOH, reacting with acetic acid (a keto acid) would produce sodium acetate (CH3COONa) and water. Sodium acetate has the formula CH3COO-Na+. The acetate ion is CH3COO^-, which has two oxygen atoms in the carbonate-like part. Wait, acetate is CH3COO^-, so that's O in the COO group. So in the product, the salt would have the acetate ion. So the product would have two oxygen atoms in the acetate ion. That fits the condition.

So if the product of X (like NaOH) and a keto acid (like acetic acid) produces a salt with 2 oxygen atoms, that makes sense. So the product would have the formula CH3COO-M+, where M is the cation from X.

So that suggests that X is a hydroxide or a base, perhaps. Because if X reacts with a keto acid, which is a weak acid, then X is a strong base, like NaOH.

Wait, but let's tie this back to the initial reaction. X reacts with Y to produce gas W, precipitate G. If X is NaOH, what would Y be? Let's think, if Y is a carbonate, perhaps. But wait, NaOH is a base. Reacting it with a carbonate might not produce a precipitate. Alternatively, if Y is a metal chloride, perhaps.

Wait, another angle: the reaction of X with Y produces a precipitate. So perhaps X is a metal hydroxide, and Y is a salt solution which forms an insoluble hydroxide. For example, if Y is a copper sulfate solution and X is NaOH, then the reaction would produce Cu(OH)2 precipitate. But then, what gas would be released? Maybe in that case, no gas is produced. Hmm.

Wait, but if X is a carbonate, like CaCO3, and Y is HCl, the reaction would produce CO2 gas and CaCl2. But in that case, CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate would form. Hmm, but the question says a precipitate forms, so that scenario doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid, and X is a metal carbonate. If X is a metal carbonate, and Y is a strong acid, the reaction would produce CO2 gas and the corresponding salt. But again, if the salt is soluble, no precipitate. So perhaps Y is not an acid.

Wait, another possibility: Y is a nitrate solution, and X is a metal. For instance, if X is magnesium and Y is dilute nitric acid, the reaction might produce hydrogen gas, but that's not matching the earlier condition where W has equal protons and neutrons.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a salt that reacts with X to form a precipitate. For example, if Y is a solution of a sulfide, and X is a metal ion, the reaction might produce a precipitate. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal and Y is water. But that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, Y could be another solution.

Wait, let's think about the product when X reacts with a keto acid. If X is NaOH, the product would be the sodium salt of the keto acid. So for acetic acid (CH3COOH), the product would be CH3COONa and water. So in that case, X is NaOH. So maybe X is a hydroxide, like NaOH.

So if X is NaOH, what would the reaction with Y look like? Let's say Y is a solution of a metal nitrate. Then, NaOH and the nitrate would react to form a precipitate of the metal hydroxide. For example, if Y is Cu(NO3)2, then NaOH would react to produce Cu(OH)2 precipitate. But then, what gas would be released? Probably none. Or maybe some other reaction.

Wait, but earlier thoughts about gas W: if W is CO2, then perhaps the reaction between X and Y produces CO2. Let's think of a reaction that produces CO2. If X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, and Y is HCl, then the reaction would produce CO2 and NaCl. But NaCl is soluble, so no precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if X is a bicarbonate, like NaHCO3, reacting with HCl would produce CO2, NaCl, and water. Again, no precipitate. Hmm.

Wait another approach: if the precipitate G, upon heating, releases B. So when G is heated, it decomposes into B and maybe other products. What if G is a carbonate, and upon heating, it decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. Then, B would be CO2. But earlier we thought W is CO2. But that would mean W and B are the same, which seems unlikely. Or maybe not.

Wait, but the melting point of B is close to 277 K. Let me recall some common substances. For example, water's melting point is 273 K (0°C). So B's melting point is about 4°C. Hmm. Which substances have a melting point around that? Well, water itself. But if B is water, that's a possibility. But how would that fit into the reaction?

Wait, if G is a hydrate, perhaps. For example, when heated, it loses water. Or maybe G is a carbonate that decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. But earlier that didn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a salt that has a low melting point. For example, NaNO2 has a melting point of about 327 K, which is higher than 277 K. Not matching. Another thought: perhaps B is a substance like ammonium chloride, but that's 337.7 K. Hmm. Not matching.

Wait, let's think of a substance that's a solid with a melting point near 4°C. Maybe something like a certain hydrate. For example, calcium acetate tetrahydrate has a melting point of about 42°C, but that's higher than 4. Alternatively, perhaps it's something else.

Wait, maybe B is an oxide. For example, lead oxide has a high melting point, but perhaps some other oxide. Wait, sodium oxide has a melting point around 1700°C, which is way higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a carbonate that doesn't decompose upon heating but is a solid with a low melting point. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: The product of the reaction of X with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. So if X is NaOH, then the product would be a sodium salt of the acid. Let's say the acid is propanoic acid (CH2CH2COOH). The salt would be CH2CH2COO-Na+. The acetate group has two oxygen atoms. So that fits.

So putting it together: X is NaOH, which reacts with Y. When Y is a solution of a metal nitrate, say Cu(NO3)2, NaOH reacts to form Cu(OH)2 as a precipitate. But then, what gas is released? Maybe no gas, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is another compound. Wait, but earlier the reaction between X and Y produces gas W. If X is NaOH and Y is a carbonate, perhaps the carbonate is in a solution. But then, reaction would produce CO2, but no precipitate if the salt is soluble.

Wait, maybe Y is an acid, like H2SO4, but that's a strong acid. However, when a strong base like NaOH reacts with a strong acid, it would just form water and the corresponding salt. No precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I'm on the wrong track. Let me think of another possibility.

Wait, when X is a metal, like Mg, and reacts with an acid Y, say HCl, it produces H2 gas. But H2 has 2p and 0n, which doesn't fit the W condition. So that's out.

Wait, another thought: W is a molecule where each atom has equal number of protons and neutrons. Wait, no, the question says the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons in total. So maybe W is a molecule like CH3OH (methanol). Let's see: C has 6p, 6n. Each H has 1p, 0n. O has 8p, 8n. So total protons: 6 + 4*1 +8= 6+4+8=18. Neutrons: 6 (C) + 4*0 (H) +8 (O)=14. 18 vs 14, nope.

Wait, perhaps W is a noble gas. For example, Argon has 18p and 22n. Doesn't fit. Krypton: 36p, 48n. No. Xenon: 54p, 76n. No.

Wait, maybe W is a molecule with a single atom, like O3 or O2. O2 is diatomic. So each O has 8p, 8n. So 2 O atoms: 16p, 16n. That's equal. So W is O2. Now, how would that fit into the reaction? So X reacting with Y produces O2.

What reactions produce O2? Decomposition of a peroxide, perhaps. For example, H2O2 decomposes into H2O and O2. So if X is a catalyst for such a decomposition. But the question says X is a substance that incorporates a heavier isotope.

Alternatively, maybe X is a peroxide, like Na2O2. When it reacts with an acid, perhaps it produces O2. Let me think: Na2O2 reacting with H2SO4 perhaps? The reaction would produce O2, sodium sulfate, and water. For example: Na2O2 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + H2O2 + O2↑. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact products. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is something like:

2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2↑.

In that case, if Y is water, then X is Na2O2. So when X (sodium peroxide) reacts with Y (water), it produces O2 gas, NaOH, and H2O. Then, the precipitate G would be something else, but wait, NaOH is soluble. Hmm, that doesn't fit because the reaction produces a solution, not a precipitate.

Wait, perhaps if Y is another solution. For example, if Y is a solution of a sulfate, and X is a peroxide. Let me think: Na2O2 reacting with a solution of a sulfate may produce O2 and a precipitate if the resulting salt is insoluble. For example, if Y is CuSO4 solution: maybe the reaction produces Cu(OH)2 as a precipitate, along with O2 gas and sodium sulfate. But I'm not sure about the exact reaction equation.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution containing a nitrate, and X is a metal. Let's say X is magnesium, and Y is a nitrate solution. The reaction could produce magnesium nitrate, hydrogen gas, but that's not O2. Hmm.

Wait, going back to X being Na2O2 (sodium peroxide). So X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Sodium has isotopes, but the heavier ones are less common. Oxygen has several isotopes, like O-16, O-18, etc. So if X is Na2O2, it could have O-18, making it heavier.

So, when X reacts with Y (maybe water), it produces O2 gas. Then, the precipitate G is, perhaps, sodium hydroxide? No, that's soluble. Hmm. Maybe Y isn't water but another solution.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a carbonate, and X is a peroxide. Then, their reaction could produce O2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: when X reacts with Y, it forms a precipitate G, which upon heating releases B. If X is Na2O2, and Y is a solution of a nitrate, perhaps the reaction produces a metal oxide as a precipitate. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a carbonate, and upon heating, it decomposes into B (which is CO2, but earlier that didn't fit). Hmm.

Wait, let me think about B's melting point again. If B is a solid with a melting point close to 277 K (4°C), perhaps B is a hydrate or a salt with a low melting point. For example, calcium nitrate tetrahydrate has a melting point around 27°C. Close to 277 K (273 +4=277), which is 4°C. So, 27°C is about 300 K. So that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound.

Alternatively, maybe B is a solid with a lower melting point. For instance, perhaps B is ammonium nitrate, which has a melting point of around 169°C (so 444 K). Not matching.

Wait, perhaps B is a substance that's a solid near room temperature but melts just above 0°C. For example, maybe B is a certain type of salt or a crystalline structure. I'm not sure.

Another approach: Let's think about the product of X and a keto acid. The product has 2 oxygen atoms. So if X is NaOH, and the product is sodium acetate (CH3COO-Na+), the acetate ion has two oxygen atoms. So that matches.

So if X is NaOH, then what's Y? Let's think about the reaction where NaOH (X) reacts with Y to produce gas W, precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a sulfide. So, X is NaOH, Y is Na2S. The reaction would produce Na2S + NaOH → perhaps nothing, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a nitrate of a metal that reacts with NaOH to form a precipitate.

Wait, sodium hydroxide reacts with copper(II) nitrate to form Cu(OH)2 precipitate and sodium nitrate. So the reaction would be:

Cu(NO3)2 + 2 NaOH → Cu(OH)2↓ + 2 NaNO3.

In this case, Y is Cu(NO3)2 solution, and X is NaOH. The precipitate G is Cu(OH)2. Now, when G is heated, what happens? Copper(II) hydroxide, when heated, decomposes into copper(II) oxide and water. So heating Cu(OH)2 gives CuO and H2O.

Then, B would be H2O. The melting point of H2O (water) is 273 K, which is very close to 277 K. So that fits.

So this scenario seems to fit. Let me outline the steps:

1. X is NaOH (sodium hydroxide), which incorporates a heavier isotope (like O-18), making it heavier.

2. Y is a solution of copper(II) nitrate (Cu(NO3)2).

3. Reaction between X and Y: 2 NaOH + Cu(NO3)2 → Cu(OH)2 ↓ + 2 NaNO3.

4. Gas W: No gas is released here. Hmm, that's a problem because the reaction between NaOH and Cu(NO3)2 doesn't produce a gas. So this contradicts the initial condition.

Wait, that's a problem. So perhaps this isn't the right path. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: X is Na2O2 (sodium peroxide), which reacts with Y (water) to produce O2 gas. Let's see:

2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2↑.

So gas W is O2, which has 16p and 16n, so equal. That fits.

Then, the precipitate G would be... wait, NaOH is soluble, so why is there a precipitate? Hmm, that doesn't fit. Unless Y is a solution that reacts with NaOH to form an insoluble compound.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a sulfide, like CuS. But more likely, perhaps Y is a solution of a nitrate, but the reaction produces a precipitate of a hydroxide. Wait, when Na2O2 reacts with a solution of, say, copper nitrate, perhaps it produces Cu(OH)2 as a precipitate along with O2 gas and sodium nitrate.

Let me write that reaction:

2 Na2O2 + 2 Cu(NO3)2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaNO3 + 2 Cu(OH)2 ↓ + O2↑.

Is that a plausible reaction? Not exactly, but perhaps something like that could happen. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more straightforward, like the peroxide acting as an oxidizing agent.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is:

Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + O2↑.

In this case, if Y is water, then the reaction produces NaOH, which is soluble. So no precipitate. But the question says a precipitate forms. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a carbonate. Let's say Y is CaCO3. Then, Na2O2 reacts with CaCO3. I'm not sure about that reaction, but perhaps it produces O2 and other products. Alternatively, maybe it's a decomposition reaction. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a nitrate, and X is a metal. For example, Mg reacts with a nitrate solution to produce Mg(NO3)2, H2 gas, but that's not O2.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider another X. Let's think about another strong base. Maybe X is KOH. Then, when KOH reacts with a solution of a sulfate, like CuSO4, it would produce Cu(OH)2 precipitate. But the reaction between KOH and CuSO4 is:

CuSO4 + 2 KOH → K2SO4 + Cu(OH)2↓.

No gas is released in this reaction, so that doesn't fit the condition of producing W.

Another approach: perhaps W is CO. So, how to get CO from a reaction. For example, the reduction of a carbonate with a metal. Maybe:

2 Na2CO3 + 2 Al → 2 NaAlO2 + 3 CO2↑. No, that produces CO2.

Alternatively, perhaps a reaction between a metal and a carbonate under certain conditions produces CO. For example, maybe:

CaCO3 + H2SO4 → CaSO4 + CO2↑ + H2O. No, again CO2.

Hmm. Maybe I'm stuck trying to find W. Let me think about the initial conditions again.

X is a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents include NaOH, KOH, THF, DMSO, etc. But X uses a heavy isotope, which suggests it might be a compound with isotopes, like O-18 in H2O or NaOH.

Wait, another thought: X could be a deuterated compound. For example, NaOD, where O is heavy. But that's probably not the case here.

Wait, maybe X is a halogen, like Cl2, but that's a gas and doesn't fit the reagent description. Alternatively, perhaps X is something like DMSO (but DMSO is (CH3)2SO, which doesn't have heavy isotopes in the molecule itself).

Wait, perhaps X is a metal, like magnesium, which can have a heavy isotope. But magnesium's isotopes are mostly around mass 24, 25, 26. The heavier would be Mg-26. So, if X is Mg, the heavier isotope would be Mg-26. Then, when Mg reacts with an acid Y, it produces H2 gas. But H2 has 2p and 0n, which doesn't fit W's condition. So that can't be.

Wait, another angle: The product of X and a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. So, for example, if X is Mg and the acid is acetic acid, the product would be magnesium acetate, which has the formula Mg(CH3COO)2. Each acetate has two oxygen atoms, so the product indeed has 2 O atoms. So that fits.

So X is Mg. Then, when Mg reacts with Y, it produces gas W, precipitate G. Let's think about Mg reacting with a solution. Mg is a metal and reacts with acids to produce H2 gas. But H2 doesn't fit W's condition of equal protons and neutrons. So that's a problem.

Wait, unless W is something else. Let me think again. If X is Mg, and Y is a carbonate solution. MgCO3. The reaction would be Mg + MgCO3 → MgO + MgCO2? No, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps Mg reacts with a carbonate solution to produce CO2 and Mg compounds.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is MgCO3 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 + CO2. But MgCO3 is not very stable. Alternatively, perhaps Mg reacts with a carbonate solution to produce a precipitate and CO2 gas.

Wait, but if Mg reacts with a carbonate solution (like Na2CO3), perhaps the reaction is:

Mg + Na2CO3 + H2O → Mg(OH)2↓ + Na2Mg(CO3)2? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces MgCO3 and NaOH.

Alternatively, perhaps Mg reacts with a carbonate solution to produce CO2 gas. For example:

Mg + 2 Na2CO3 + 2 H2O → Mg(OH)2↓ + 2 Na2MgCO3.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the products. Alternatively, perhaps Mg reacts with Na2CO3 to produce MgCO3 and NaOH, but MgCO3 is not very soluble and might precipitate.

Hmm. If Mg reacts with Na2CO3, perhaps the reaction is:

Mg + Na2CO3 → MgCO3 + 2 Na.

But that seems unlikely because Na is a strong reducing agent and not commonly found in such reactions. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces NaOH and MgCO3.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a sulfide. Mg reacts with a sulfide solution to produce H2S gas. But H2S has 2p (from S) and 2n (S has 16n in the common isotope). Wait, total protons: 2 (from H) +16 (from S) =18. Neutrons: 2*0 (H) +16 (S) =16. 18 vs 16, no match. So that's not W.

Wait, perhaps W is CO.

Another angle: gas W is CO. So when X reacts with Y, CO is produced. Let me think of reactions that produce CO. One possibility is the reduction of a carbonate. For example:

CaCO3 + H2 → CaO + CO↑ + H2O. But that's under high temperature and with H2 as a reducing agent. But in this scenario, X would be the carbonate, Y would be H2, and the reaction produces CO gas. But X is a reagent in organic chemistry, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal and Y is a carbon-containing compound. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal and Y is a carbonyl compound. For example, the reaction of Mg with COCl2 could produce MgCl2 and CO gas. Let me think: Mg + COCl2 → MgCl2 + CO↑. If that's the case, then W is CO. So gas W has equal protons and neutrons (as we discussed earlier, 14 each), so that fits.

But would that produce a precipitate? If Y is COCl2 (phosgene), a liquid? Well, COCl2 is a gas at room temperature, so perhaps Y is a solution of something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution containing Cl- ions, and X is Mg. Then, X reacts with Y (Cl-) to produce MgCl2 and some gas. But that would produce H2 if Y is an acid, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps Y is a chloroform solution. Mg reacts with chloroform under certain conditions to produce CH4 gas. But CH4 has 4p and 4n (each H has 0n). So 4 vs 4, which fits W's condition. So W could be CH4.

So X is Mg, Y is chloroform (CHCl3). But I'm not certain about the reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is Mg + CHCl3 → CH4 + MgCl. But I'm not sure if that's a valid reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal chloride, and X is Mg. Mg reacts with the chloride to produce HCl gas, but HCl has 1p and 1n? Wait, HCl molecule: H (1p, 0n) and Cl (17p, 18n). So total protons: 18+1=19. Neutrons: 18. 19 vs 18. Doesn't fit.

So this seems to be getting too complicated. Maybe I should think about the elements in X.

The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

So, X is a compound with two elements, perhaps. For example, NaOH has Na, O, and H. The lightest element is H (atomic mass ~1), and the heaviest is O (16) or Na (23). But if X has heavier isotopes, perhaps O is O-18, which has an atomic mass of 18.

Wait, but in X, each O atom is replaced with a heavier isotope. Wait, the question says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So perhaps X is a compound where one of its atoms is a heavier isotope.

But when calculating the cumulative atomic masses, we need to sum the lightest and heaviest elements present in X. So if X is NaOH, the elements are Na, O, H. The lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). So sum is 24.

Wait, but the options given are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Hmm, 24 isn't an option, so perhaps X is a different compound.

Wait, another possibility: X is NH3, but that's a gas. Not likely a reagent in the same way as NaOH.

Alternatively, X could be something like CH3COONa (sodium acetate), but that doesn't involve a heavy isotope necessarily.

Wait, perhaps X is something like D2O (deuterated water), where the isotope is deuterium. But D2O is used as a reagent, but I'm not sure if that's what the question is pointing to.

Alternatively, perhaps X is H2O with a heavy oxygen isotope, like O-18. So X is H2O. Then the lightest element is H (1), the heaviest is O (16). Sum is 17, but that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: X is a halogen. For example, Cl2. But Cl2 is diatomic and a gas, not a reagent that reacts to form a precipitate necessarily.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a transition metal, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Then, the elements are Na, C, O. The lightest is C (12?), wait no. Wait, elements are Na (23), C (12), O (16). So lightest is C (12), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 35. Option A is 35.

Wait, but earlier I thought X was NaOH, but perhaps X is Na2CO3. Let me see.

If X is Na2CO3, then when it reacts with Y (which could be HCl), the reaction would produce CO2 gas and NaCl. But NaCl is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm, but the question states that a precipitate forms. So that scenario doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal nitrate. For example, if Y is Cu(NO3)2, and X is Na2CO3, the reaction would produce CuCO3 precipitate and NaNO3. Then, when CuCO3 is heated, it decomposes into CuO and CO2. So B would be CO2, but earlier we saw that the melting point of B is about 4°C, which doesn't fit CO2 (which is a gas at room temperature).

Wait, but if B is CO2, its melting point is way lower than 277 K. Wait, CO2's melting point is about 217 K (-56°C). So that's not close to 277 K.

Hmm. So perhaps X isn't Na2CO3.

Wait, another possibility: X is NaNO3 (sodium nitrate). Doesn't fit the heavy isotope condition as much, but let's think. Reacting with Y (maybe something else) produces a precipitate. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, like Fe. But when Fe reacts with an acid, it produces H2 gas, which doesn't fit the W condition.

Wait, maybe X is something like ethanol, but that's a liquid. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a halide, like NaCl. But NaCl is a solid and doesn't react violently with much, unless with a strong base, but that would produce NaOH and HCl, which are both soluble. So no precipitate.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let me try to think of the elements in X. The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

If X is a compound with elements A and B, where A is lightest (say H) and B is heaviest (say Cl), then the sum is 1 + 35.5 = 36.5, which is close to option A (35), but not exact.

Wait, but the question says to consider the cumulative atomic masses, including all instances. Wait, no, the question says 'the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X.' So if X has multiple elements, we take the lightest and heaviest, sum their atomic masses.

So, for example, if X is NaOH: elements Na (23), O (16), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24. Not an option.

If X is Na2O2: elements Na (23), O (16). Lightest is O (16?), no. Wait, wait no: the lightest element is O, but in Na2O2, O is the same as in any other compound. Wait, no: in Na2O2, the elements are Na and O. So lightest is O? No, no, wait: the elements in Na2O2 are Na and O. Oh, wait, no: Na has atomic number 11, O is 8. So O is lighter than Na. So the lightest element is O (16), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 16+23=39. Not an option.

Wait, but the question says to sum all the heavier and lighter isotopes. Wait, no: the question says, "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Wait, no, the wording is tricky. Let me read it again: "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Wait, perhaps for each element present in X, we sum all the isotopes (masses), and then among those elements, select the lightest and heaviest in terms of their atomic masses, then sum those two elements' total masses.

Wait, that's a bit unclear, but perhaps.

For example, if X is NaOH, elements are Na, O, H.

Each element's isotopes:

- Na: approx. 23 (Na-23 is the most abundant)
- O: 16 (O-16), 17, 18.
- H: 1.

So the cumulative atomic masses for each element are:

- H: 1 (only one isotope)
- O: 16 + 17 + 18 = 51
- Na: 23.

Now, the lightest element is H (1), heaviest is O (51) or Na (23). So the heaviest is O (51). Summing H (1) + O (51) =52.

But that doesn't match any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question means to take the lightest and heaviest elements in terms of their atomic number, not mass. But that would be H (lightest) and O (heaviest in X, if X has O and Na), but that doesn't fit the sum either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of another approach.

If X is NaOH, the elements are Na, O, H. The lightest element is H, heaviest is O. Wait, no, O is 16, Na is 23. So heaviest is Na (23). So sum is 1 + 23=24. Not an option.

If X is KOH, then elements are K, O, H. K is 39, O 16, H 1. So sum is 1+39=40. Not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid), but that's a liquid and not a reagent that reacts violently.

Alternatively, X could be a chlorinated compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal oxide, like MgO. Then, elements are Mg (24.3) and O (16). Sum is 24.3 +16=40.3. Not an option.

Wait, another approach: the product of X with a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. So, if X is a base like NaOH, and the product is sodium acetate (CH3COO-Na+), which has 2 O in the acetate group. So that fits.

So, X is NaOH. Now, let's find what Y is. X reacts with Y to produce gas W, precipitate G. Then, when G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K.

So, if X is NaOH, Y could be a solution of a metal nitrate. Let's say Y is Cu(NO3)2. The reaction would produce Cu(OH)2 precipitate and sodium nitrate. But no gas is produced in this reaction. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate solution. Let's say Y is Na2CO3. Then, X (NaOH) and Y (Na2CO3) would react to produce NaCO3 (sodium carbonate?), but that doesn't make sense because they're the same. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a sulfate. For example, Y is CuSO4. Then, X (NaOH) reacts to produce Cu(OH)2 precipitate and Na2SO4. Again, no gas is produced.

Wait, but the reaction between NaOH and a nitrate might not produce gas. So perhaps Y is a different compound.

Wait, maybe Y is a solution of a carbonate, and the reaction produces CO2 gas. For example, Y is Na2CO3, and X is HCl. But earlier the question says X is a reagent, so perhaps it's the base. So Y would be an acid.

Wait, perhaps X is NaOH, Y is H2SO4. Then, the reaction would be:

2 NaOH + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + 2 H2O.

No gas is produced, so that doesn't fit.

Another possibility: X is NaOH, Y is a solution of a sulfite, like Na2SO3. The reaction would produce SO2 gas. Let's see: SO2 has 16 (S) + 2(1) =18 protons. Neutrons: S has 16, O has 8 each. So 16 + 2*8 =32. 18 vs 32, no match. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if Y is a solution of a sulfide, like Na2S. NaOH and Na2S would not react to produce gas. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a carbonate, and X is a strong base. Then, perhaps the reaction produces CO2 gas. For example, Y could be a carbonate solution, and X is NaOH. But that doesn't make sense because NaOH and Na2CO3 together might not react.

Wait, perhaps Y is a different carbonate, like CaCO3. Then, X (NaOH) and Y (CaCO3) might react to produce Na2CO3 and Ca(OH)2. But Ca(OH)2 is sparingly soluble. So, the reaction would produce a precipitate of Ca(OH)2 and release CO2 gas.

Wait, but let's write the reaction:

CaCO3 + 2 NaOH → Na2CO3 + Ca(OH)2.

Ca(OH)2 has low solubility, so it precipitates. CO2 is released as gas. So W is CO2, which fits the condition of having 16p and 16n. Because each CO2 molecule has 12 (C) + 16 (O2) =28 protons? Wait, no: CO2 has C (6p) and 2 O (each 8p), so total protons: 6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons: C has 6, each O has 8, so 6 + 2*8=22. So W is CO2, which matches the condition.

So, X is NaOH, Y is CaCO3. Reaction produces Na2CO3, Ca(OH)2 precipitate, and CO2 gas.

Then, when the precipitate G (Ca(OH)2) is heated, it decomposes into CaO and H2O. So B is H2O. The melting point of H2O is 273 K, which is very close to 277 K mentioned in the question.

So, that scenario fits.

Now, the elements present in X (NaOH) are Na, O, H.

The lightest element is H (atomic mass ~1), the heaviest is Na (23). So sum is 1 +23=24. But the options don't have 24. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the question says to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.

Wait, so for each element in X, sum all possible isotopes' masses, then find the lightest and heaviest elements based on their individual atomic masses, then sum their total masses.

Wait, but in X (NaOH), the elements are Na, O, H.

For Na: The main isotopes are Na-23 (mass 23), Na-24 (24), Na-25 (25). So the cumulative atomic masses for Na would be 23 +24 +25 =72.

For O: isotopes are O-16 (16), O-17 (17), O-18 (18). Sum is 16+17+18=51.

For H: only H-1 (1). So sum is 1.

So the elements in X are Na (sum 72), O (sum 51), H (sum 1).

The lightest element in X is H (sum 1), the heaviest is Na (sum 72). So the sum is 1 +72=73.

Hmm, but the options don't have 73. So perhaps I misunderstood the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering their main atomic masses, not including all isotopes.

In that case, X is NaOH. The elements are Na (23), O (16), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24. Not in options.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Let's think again.

If X is Na2O2, which is sodium peroxide. Elements are Na and O.

Na: 23, O:16.

The lightest element is O (16), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 16 +23=39. Not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is something with Cl. For example, if X is NaCl, but that's a solid and doesn't react violently to form a precipitate and gas.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, like K2CO3. Elements are K, C, O.

K: 39, C:12, O:16. Lightest is C (12), heaviest is K (39). Sum is 51. Not an option.

Wait, another angle: What if X is a different base, like KOH. Then, elements are K, O, H.

K: 39, O:16, H:1. Sum of lightest (H) and heaviest (K) is 40. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is Mg(OH)2, but that's a solid and not a liquid. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a different compound. Let's think of the product with a keto acid containing 2 O atoms. If X is a metal, like Zn, and the product is Zn(OAc)2, which would have two acetate groups, each with two O. So that fits.

But then, what would the reaction between Zn and Y look like? If Y is a carbonate, perhaps the reaction produces CO2 and a zinc carbonate precipitate.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I've been focusing on the wrong X. Let me recap.

Based on the reaction, X is a strong base, probably NaOH. It reacts with Y (a carbonate like CaCO3) to produce CO2 gas, precipitate Ca(OH)2, which upon heating gives B=H2O. So B's melting point is 273 K, which is very close to 277 K.

So, X is NaOH. Now, the elements in X are Na, O, H.

The lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24.

But the options don't have 24. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the question says "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Ah! So, for each element in X, we sum all its isotopes' masses. Then, find the lightest and heaviest elements in X based on their individual atomic masses, then sum those two elements' total masses.

So, for X = NaOH:

Elements present: Na, O, H.

For each element, sum all isotopes.

- Na: main isotopes are Na-23 (23), Na-24 (24), Na-25 (25). Sum =23 +24 +25=72.
- O: isotopes O-16 (16), O-17 (17), O-18 (18). Sum=16 +17 +18=51.
- H: only H-1 (1). Sum=1.

Now, the elements in X are Na (72), O (51), H (1).

The lightest element is H (1), the heaviest is Na (72). So their sum is 73.

But the options don't have 73. So perhaps X is a different compound.

Wait, perhaps X is something else. What if X is a compound with O-18, like H2O. Then, X is H2O, which is a liquid. But H2O as X doesn't fit the reagent description in the reaction with Y to produce a precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a different compound, like NH4OH (a weak base). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like CH3ONa (sodium methoxide). Then, the elements are C, H, O, Na.

For each element, sum isotopes:

- C: 12, 13, 14 → sum=12+13+14=39.
- H: 1 → sum=1.
- O: 16+17+18=51.
- Na:23+24+25=72.

Lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Na (72). Sum is 73. Still not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with two elements, say CaO. Then, elements are Ca and O.

- Ca: isotopes Ca-40 (40), Ca-42 (42), etc. Let's say sum is 40 +42 +44= 126.
- O: sum 51.

Lightest is O (51), heaviest is Ca (126). Sum is 51+126=177. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the options given: the possible sums are 35,25,31,29.

If the sum is 35 (option A), perhaps the elements are O (16) and Cl (35). So 16 +35=51. No, that's not 35.

Wait, wait. What if the elements are O (16) and F (19)? 16+19=35. So option A is 35.

But how would that fit into X?

If X is a compound containing O and F, like NaF or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like KClO3. Then, elements are K, Cl, O.

But the sum would be K (39) + Cl (35) =74. Not an option.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the lightest and heaviest elements sum to 35 (option A). So, looking for two elements where their atomic masses add up to 35.

Possible pairs:

- H (1) + Cl (35) → 36. Close but not 35.
- O (16) + Cl (35) → 51.
- F (19) + O (16) →35. Oh, that's a sum of 35.

So, if X contains F and O as elements, their sum is 19 +16=35.

So which compound has F and O? For example, O is part of a compound with F, like NaF? No, NaF is Na and F. Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound like OF2.

Wait, but OF2 is a diatomic molecule, a gas. Not a reagent that reacts to form a precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound like CaF2. Then, elements are Ca and F. But their sum is 40 +19=59.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps X is something like HFO (hypofluorite), but that's not a common compound.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound like NaF, but that only contains Na and F.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with O and F, but I can't think of a common one that fits the reagent description.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a different compound. Maybe something like CH3F, but that's a fluorinated hydrocarbon, not a reagent in the way described.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to make a decision based on the clues.

Given the earlier scenario where X is NaOH, the sum of the lightest (H) and heaviest (Na) is 24, which isn't an option. So perhaps X is a different compound.

Wait, another approach: the product of X and a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms. So, the product is a salt with two oxygen atoms. For example, if X is Mg and the acid is H2SO4, the product would be MgSO4, which has four oxygen atoms. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, if the product has two oxygen atoms, perhaps it's a salt like NaOAc (sodium acetate), which has two oxygen atoms in the acetate group. So X is NaOH, and the product is NaOAc.

So, X is NaOH.

Now, the problem is to find the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X (NaOH) considering all isotopes. As before, that sum is 73, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, not the sum of their isotopes.

So, in X (NaOH), the elements are Na (23), O (16), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the isotopes in X, but only the lightest and heaviest isotopes of each element. For example, in Na, lightest is Na-23, heaviest is Na-25. Sum for Na: 23+25=48. For O, lightest is O-16, heaviest is O-18. Sum:16+18=34. For H, only H-1: sum 1.

Now, the lightest element overall is H (sum 1), heaviest is Na (sum 48). Sum is 49. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the atomic numbers. But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the options again.

The options are 35,25,31,29.

If the correct answer is 35 (option A), then the sum is 19 (F) +16 (O)=35.

So, X must have F and O as elements.

But what compound has F and O and is used as a reagent in organic chemistry? Maybe something like Ozone (O3) is a reagent, but that's a gas.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a perfluorinated compound, but I can't think of one that fits the reaction conditions.

Wait, another thought: X could be a fluorinated hydroxide, like NaF, but that doesn't have O.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like KF, but that doesn't involve O.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound of O and F, like NaF·2H2O or something. But I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess. Based on the earlier reaction scenario where X is NaOH, the sum is 24, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct answer is 35, option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying Substance X, which reacts with liquid Y to release gas W, form precipitate G, and ultimately yield a product B with a melting point close to 277 K. Additionally, the product of X with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. The goal is to determine the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates include CO2 (14p, 14n) or O2 (16p, 16n). CO2 fits well as it is produced in reactions involving carbonates and bases.

2. **Precipitate G and Product B**: When G is heated, it releases B with a melting point close to 277 K (approximately 4°C). This suggests B could be water (H2O), as its melting point is 273 K, very close to the given value.

3. **Reaction of X with a Keto Acid**: The product contains 2 oxygen atoms, indicating X reacts with a keto acid to form a salt with an acetate group (e.g., sodium acetate, CH3COO-Na+). This suggests X is likely a base, such as NaOH.

4. **Substance X**: Based on the reaction conditions, X is identified as NaOH (sodium hydroxide). It reacts with a carbonate (e.g., CaCO3) to produce CO2 gas, a precipitate (e.g., Ca(OH)2), and releases water (H2O) upon heating the precipitate.

5. **Atomic Masses of Elements in X**: NaOH contains three elements: Na (sodium), O (oxygen), and H (hydrogen). The lightest element is H (atomic mass ~1), and the heaviest is Na (atomic mass ~23). The cumulative atomic masses of all isotopes are:
   - Na: 23 (Na-23) + 24 (Na-24) + 25 (Na-25) = 72
   - O: 16 (O-16) + 17 (O-17) + 18 (O-18) = 51
   - H: 1 (H-1) = 1

6. **Lightest and Heaviest Elements**: The lightest element is H (1), and the heaviest is Na (72). Their cumulative atomic masses sum to 73. However, this does not match the given options.

7. **Revisiting the Options**: The options provided are 35, 25, 31, and 29. Among these, 35 corresponds to the sum of the atomic masses of fluorine (19) and oxygen (16). This suggests X might involve fluorine and oxygen, but no plausible compound fits the reaction conditions described.

8. **Final Decision**: Despite inconsistencies in the match with the options, the most likely scenario based on the reaction conditions and the given melting point of B is that X is NaOH. However, the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X do not align with the provided options. Based on the closest match, the answer is selected as **35 (option A)**.

Answer: A
