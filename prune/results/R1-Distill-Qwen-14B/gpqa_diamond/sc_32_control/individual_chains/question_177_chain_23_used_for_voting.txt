Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, but wait, the question is about luminosity, so maybe the mass part isn't directly relevant here. I remember that luminosity for stars is more related to their radius and temperature, not mass directly. Although, I guess mass is related because more massive stars are usually hotter, but maybe that's not needed here.

The question says that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! That's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. The peak wavelength is determined by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant, and T is the effective temperature. So if both have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same, right? Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So same λ_max implies same temperature. So T1 = T2. Okay, that's an important point.

Now, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0 km/s, so it's probably not moving much. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Hmm, but radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh wait, but the question says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Because if a star is moving towards us, its light would be blueshifted, and if moving away, redshifted. But in this case, both have the same observed λ_max. Hmm, but that's the observed wavelength, not the rest wavelength.

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. So each star emits at a certain λ_max. But if the star is moving, that observed λ_max would change due to Doppler shift. So if both observed λ_max are the same, perhaps their rest λ_max differ based on their velocities?

Wait, no. The problem says that they found the wavelengths where they appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So that would imply that their rest λ_max are adjusted by their velocities. So the star with higher velocity (Star_2) would have a different rest wavelength.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think: if a star is moving towards us, its emitted light is blueshifted, so the observed wavelength is shorter. If moving away, it's redshifted, longer wavelength. So if both have the same observed λ_max, then their rest wavelengths must differ based on their velocities.

Wait, but the problem states that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and they are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same for both. So perhaps the rest λ_max of each star is different, but when observed (due to Doppler), they appear the same.

But wait, since Star_1 has zero velocity, its observed λ_max is the same as its rest λ_max. Star_2 has a velocity of 700 km/s. Let's assume that Star_2 is moving towards us because that would cause a blueshift, making its observed wavelength shorter. But if their observed λ_max is the same, then Star_2's rest λ_max must be longer than Star_1's. Because when Star_2 is moving towards us, it blueshifts, so λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ), or something like that.

Wait, no, I'm not sure about the exact Doppler shift formula for wavelength. Let me think. The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ) if moving away, and the opposite for moving towards. Wait, no, I think I got it wrong. Let's think about the Doppler effect for light. When a source is moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength is shorter (blueshift). The formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ), where beta is v/c. Oh wait, wait. No, the exact formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta) / (1 + beta) ) ), where beta is v/c (if moving towards us, beta is positive). So if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ would be smaller than its rest λ. But in this problem, both stars have the same observed λ_max. So Star_1's observed λ is the same as Star_2's observed λ.

But Star_1's observed λ is its rest λ, since its velocity is zero. So Star_1's λ1_rest = λ1_obs. Star_2's λ2_obs = λ2_rest (adjusted by Doppler shift) equals λ1_obs. So λ2_obs = λ1_rest.

Wait, but then to find the actual temperatures, because the rest wavelengths are different due to Doppler. Let me think. So, the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature. So T = b / λ_max.

But wait, because the observed λ_max is the same for both, but their rest λ_max are different. So, if the observed λ_max is the same, but Star_2 is moving towards us, making its observed λ smaller than its rest λ. So, Star_2's rest λ is longer than Star_1's rest λ. Because when moving towards us, the observed λ is shorter than the rest λ.

So, if Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, its observed λ is λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ), where beta is v/c. So solving for λ2_rest.

Wait, but wait, let's get the exact formula. The Doppler shift formula for wavelengths when the source is moving towards the observer is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ), where beta = v/c.

So, if Star_2's observed λ is the same as Star_1's rest λ, then:

λ1_rest = λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So,

λ2_rest = λ1_rest / sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Simplify that:

λ2_rest = λ1_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Because 1/sqrt(a/b) is sqrt(b/a).

So, then, since λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature,

T1 = b / λ1_rest,

T2 = b / λ2_rest.

So,

T2 = b / (λ1_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )) )

= (b / λ1_rest ) * (1 / sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) ) )

= T1 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

But wait, the problem states that the luminosities are to be computed assuming blackbody radiation. So, I need to find the luminosity for each star.

I remember that the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where R is radius, T is effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, for each star, L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴,

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴.

The ratio L1/L2 is (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) * (σ/σ) and 4π cancels out.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2,

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)² ) * ( T1⁴ / T2⁴ ) / ( R2² )

Simplify R terms: ( (2.25 R2²) * T1⁴ ) / ( R2² T2⁴ ) )

The R2² cancels, so 2.25 * (T1/T2)^4.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * ( T1 / T2 )^4.

But earlier, we found that T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So,

T1 / T2 = 1 / sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) )

= sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So,

(T1/T2)^4 = [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ]^2.

Putting it all together,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ]^2.

Now, beta is v/c. v for Star_2 is 700 km/s. Let's compute beta.

c is approximately 3e5 km/s, so 300,000 km/s.

v =700 km/s,

beta = 700 / 300000 ≈ 0.0023333.

So, beta is about 0.002333.

Compute (1 + beta)/(1 - beta):

(1 + 0.002333) / (1 - 0.002333) ≈ (1.002333)/(0.997667).

Let me calculate that.

1.002333 / 0.997667.

Well, 1.002333 is approximately 1.002333,

0.997667 is approximately 0.997667.

Dividing them: 1.002333 ÷ 0.997667 ≈ Let's compute.

Approximating:

1.002333 / 0.997667 ≈ 1.002333 * (1 + (0.002333/0.997667)) )

Wait, perhaps better to approximate:

Since beta is small, perhaps we can approximate (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ≈ 1 + 2 beta + 2 beta² + ... But since beta is small, maybe it's sufficient to compute it numerically.

Let me compute 1.002333 / 0.997667.

Let me compute 1.002333 ÷ 0.997667.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1e6 to eliminate decimals.

1.002333e6 = 1002333,

0.997667e6 =997667.

So, 1002333 ÷ 997667.

Let me compute that.

997667 * 1.005 = ?

997667 * 1 = 997667,

997667 *0.005=4988.335,

Total = 997667 +4988.335=1,002,655.335.

But 1002333 is less than that.

Wait, 997,667 * 1.00465 ≈ ?

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 1002333 divided by 997667.

1002333 /997667 ≈ (approx) 1.00465.

Because 997667 * 1.004 = 997667 + 3990.668 = 1,001,657.668.

Wait, 997667 * 1.00465 is approximately 997667 * 1 = 997667,

997667 *0.004=3990.668,

997667 *0.00065= approx 648.51355.

So total for 1.00465 is 997667 + 3990.668 +648.51355 ≈ 997667 + 4639.181 ≈ 1,002,306.181.

Which is close to 1,002,333. So, 1.00465 is about right.

So, approximately 1.00465.

So (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ≈ 1.00465.

So then, [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ]^2 ≈ (1.00465)^2 ≈ 1.0093 (since 0.00465^2 is about 0.0000216, so 1 + 2*0.00465 + 0.0000216 = approximately 1.0093216).

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 1.0093 ≈ 2.25 * 1.0093.

Let me compute 2.25 * 1.0093.

2.25 * 1 = 2.25.

2.25 * 0.0093 = approx 0.020925.

So total is 2.25 + 0.020925 = 2.270925.

Hmm, so approximately 2.27, but looking at the options, the closest is option D) ~2.23, but wait, wait, perhaps my approximation is too rough.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, let's recalculate (1 + beta)/(1 − beta), with beta=700/3e5=7/(3000)=0.0023333...

So, 1 + beta = 1.0023333333,

1 - beta =0.9976666667.

Compute 1.0023333333 / 0.9976666667.

Let me compute 1.0023333333 ÷ 0.9976666667.

Let me compute this division precisely.

We can write this as (1002333.3333e-6) / (997666.6667e-6) = 1002333.3333 / 997666.6667.

Let me compute this division.

Let me set 997666.6667 * x = 1002333.3333.

x = 1002333.3333 / 997666.6667.

Let me compute this using cross multiplication.

Let me approximate this using a calculator approach.

Let me compute 997666.6667 * 1.004653 ≈ 1002333.3333.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 1.0023333333 / 0.9976666667.

Let me compute this as:

(1 + 0.0023333333) / (1 - 0.0023333333).

Let me use the approximation for (1 + a)/(1 - a) ≈ 1 + 2a + 2a² when a is small.

Here, a=0.0023333333.

So,

(1 + a)/(1 - a) ≈ 1 + 2a + 2a².

a=0.0023333333,

2a=0.0046666666,

2a²=2*(0.0023333333)^2=2*(5.4444e-6)=1.08888e-5.

So,

1 + 0.0046666666 + 0.0000108888 ≈ 1.0046775554.

So,

(1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ≈ 1.0046775554.

Then, [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ]^2 ≈ (1.0046775554)^2.

To compute (1 + x)^2 where x=0.0046775554.

(1 + x)^2 ≈ 1 + 2x + x^2.

x=0.0046775554,

2x=0.0093551108,

x²=(0.0046775554)^2 ≈ 2.188e-5 ≈ 0.00002188.

So,

1 + 0.0093551108 + 0.00002188 ≈ 1.009377.

So, [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ]^2 ≈ 1.009377.

Then,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.009377 ≈ 2.25 * 1.009377.

Compute 2.25 *1.009377.

2.25 * 1 =2.25,

2.25 *0.009377≈ 0.02105775.

So total is approx 2.25 + 0.02105775 = 2.27105775.

So about 2.271.

But looking at the options, the choices are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

Hmm, 2.27 is not exactly any of the options. The closest is option D, 2.23, but that's lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, let me go back. The problem says that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor. So, L1/L2 is the factor.

Wait, but wait. Did I get the Doppler shift right?

Because Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, but the problem doesn't specify whether it's moving towards or away. Oh wait, the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s.

Which one is which? Oh, the radial velocity is the component along the line of sight. If Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, but the question doesn't specify direction. But for Doppler shift, the direction matters. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the problem says Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. The observed λ_max is the same for both.

So, Star_1's λ_max is at rest, λ1_rest = b / T1.

Star_2's λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ), if moving towards us (beta positive). Alternatively, if moving away, it's (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) in the denominator, so the observed λ would be longer.

Wait, I think I may have used the wrong Doppler shift formula earlier.

Let me double-check the Doppler shift formula.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula for frequency is:

f_obs = f_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ), when the source is moving towards the observer. For wavelengths, it's λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ), because wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional.

Wait, yes, because when the source is moving towards, the observed wavelength is shorter (blueshifted), so λ_obs < λ_rest.

So, if Star_2 is moving towards us with velocity v, then its observed λ is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) )

Wait, no. Wait, I think I got it the other way around.

Wait, if the source is moving towards the observer, the observed frequency is higher (blue shift), which means the observed wavelength is shorter. So let's get the correct formula.

The Doppler shift for wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) )

Because as beta increases (approaching speed of light), the observed wavelength decreases (blueshift).

Wait, let me confirm with a reference.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) ), when the source is moving away.

Wait, no, I think I have this wrong. Let me think carefully.

When the source is moving away (positive radial velocity), the wavelength is stretched (redshifted), so the observed wavelength is longer than the rest.

The formula for the observed wavelength when the source is moving away is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) )

Wait, no, that can't be. Because when beta is positive (source moving away), the observed wavelength should be longer than the rest, which would require the sqrt term to be greater than 1.

Wait, let's think about it.

The correct formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) )

Only when the source is moving away. If the source is moving towards, the observed wavelength is shorter, so the formula would be:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) )

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me find an exact formula.

The correct relativistic Doppler effect formula for wavelength when the source is moving with velocity v (beta = v/c) relative to the observer along the line of sight is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) ) when the source is moving away.

And λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ) when the source is moving towards.

Because if the source moves away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshift), and if it moves towards, the observed wavelength is shorter (blueshift).

So, in our problem, Star_2 has a velocity of 700 km/s. But the problem doesn't specify the direction. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says that both stars have their brightest wavelengths observed at the same λ. So, if Star_1 has zero velocity, then its observed λ is the same as its rest λ.

Star_2 has a velocity; let's assume it's moving towards us. Then, its observed λ would be shorter than its rest λ.

But the problem states that the observed λ for both is the same. So Star_2's observed λ is the same as Star_1's rest λ.

So for Star_2, moving towards us,

λ_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ) = λ1_rest.

So,

λ2_rest = λ1_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ).

That's the same as I did before.

So, T2 is related to T1.

Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature.

So, T1 = b / λ1_rest,

T2 = b / λ2_rest.

Substituting,

T2 = b / ( λ1_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) )

So,

T2 = (b / λ1_rest) * [ (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ]^0.5

= T1 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So,

T1 / T2 = sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So, (T1 / T2)^4 = [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ]^2.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (R1/R2)^2 ) * ( (T1/T2)^4 )

R1 = 1.5 R2 → (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ]^2.

As I did earlier.

Now, beta = 700/3e5 = 7/(3e3) ≈ 0.0023333.

So, (1 + beta) = 1.0023333,

(1 - beta) = 0.9976667.

Compute (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) = 1.0023333/0.9976667.

Wait, perhaps using the exact value:

1.0023333 / 0.9976667.

Compute 1.0023333 divided by 0.9976667.

Let me compute this:

0.9976667 * 1.0047 ≈ 0.9976667 * 1 + 0.9976667 * 0.0047.

0.9976667 * 0.0047 ≈ 0.0047 * 1e6 ≈ 4700, but scaled down.

Wait, perhaps better to compute it as:

Compute 1002333.333 / 997666.667.

Let me set x = 1002333.333,

y=997666.667.

Compute x/y:

x = 1002333.333,

y = 997666.667.

x = y + 4666.666.

So, x/y = 1 + (4666.666 / y).

y=997666.667,

4666.666 / y = 4666.666 / 997666.667 ≈ 0.004677.

So, x/y ≈ 1.004677.

So,

(1 + beta)/(1 - beta) = 1.004677.

Then, [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ]^2 ≈ (1.004677)^2.

Compute (1.004677)^2 = 1 + 2*0.004677 + (0.004677)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.009354 + 0.00002186 ≈ 1.00937586.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00937586 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00937586.

Compute 2.25 * 1.00937586.

2.25 * 1 = 2.25,

2.25 * 0.00937586 ≈ 0.021059.

So, total is approx 2.271059.

So, about 2.271.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D) ~2.23, but that's under. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should re-express the problem differently.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the factor exactly.

Let me compute (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) exactly.

Beta is 700/3e5 = 700 / 300,000 = 7/(3000) = 0.002333333...

So,

1 + beta = 1 + 7/3000 = 3007/3000,

1 - beta = 1 - 7/3000 = 2993/3000.

So, (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) = (3007/3000) / (2993/3000) ) = 3007/2993.

So, 3007 divided by 2993.

Compute 3007 / 2993 ≈ 1.00468.

Which matches our earlier approximation.

Then, [3007/2993]^2 = (3007^2) / (2993^2).

Compute 3007^2 ≈ (3000 +7)^2 = 3000² + 2*3000*7 +7² =9,000,000 +42,000 +49=9,042,049.

2993^2 = (3000 -7)^2 =3000^2 - 2*3000*7 +7^2=9,000,000 -42,000 +49=8,958,049.

So, [3007/2993]^2 = 9,042,049 / 8,958,049 ≈ let's compute that.

Compute 9,042,049 ÷8,958,049.

Approximately, 8,958,049 * 1.00937 ≈ 8,958,049 + 8,958,049 * 0.00937.

Compute 8,958,049 *0.00937 ≈ Approximately,

8,958,049 *0.009 = 80,622.441,

8,958,049 *0.00037≈ 3,314.478,

Total ≈ 80,622.441 +3,314.478≈83,936.919.

So, 8,958,049 *1.00937≈8,958,049 +83,936.919=9,041,985.919.

Which is just under 9,042,049.

So, 9,042,049/8,958,049 ≈ approximately 1.00937.

So, [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ]^2 ≈1.00937.

Thus,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00937 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00937 ≈ 2.271, as before.

But the options don't have this. The options are A: ~2.25, B: ~2.32, C: ~2.35, D: ~2.23.

Hmm, none of these exactly match 2.27. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated something else.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler shift was applied incorrectly. Let me think again.

Wait, is it possible that Star_2 is moving away from us? Because if Star_2 is moving away, the observed wavelength would be longer, so Star_2's observed λ would be longer than Star_1's. But the problem states they have the same observed λ, which would not be possible if Star_2 is moving away, because then its observed λ would be longer than Star_1's (since Star_1 is at rest).

Wait, that would not fit. Because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ would be longer than its rest λ. But Star_1's λ is its rest λ. So if both observed λ are same, then Star_2's rest λ must be shorter than Star_1's. Because when moving away, observed λ is longer than rest λ. So if Star_2's rest λ is shorter than Star_1's, then when it moves away, its observed λ would be longer than rest λ, but we're told that both observed λ are the same. So, Star_2's observed λ can't be longer than Star_1's if they are same.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction. Let me think again.

Scenario 1: Star_2 is moving towards us (beta positive, approaching).

Then, λ_obs_2 = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

And λ_obs_1 = λ1_rest.

We're told λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2, so:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So, λ2_rest = λ1_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Which is what I did before.

Scenario 2: Star_2 is moving away (beta positive, receding).

Then, λ_obs_2 = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

And λ_obs_1 = λ1_rest.

Set them equal:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Which would lead to:

λ2_rest = λ1_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Which makes λ2_rest smaller than λ1_rest.

Thus, T2 = b/λ2_rest = b/( λ1_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So,

T1/T2 = sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Then,

(T1/T2)^4 = [ (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ]^2.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5)^2 ) * [ (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ]^2

Hmm, wait, this would change the calculation.

Wait, in this case, if Star_2 is moving away, then,

L1/L2 = (2.25) * [ (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ]^2.

So, let's compute that.

Beta = 700/3e5 = 0.0023333.

(1 - beta)/(1 + beta) = (0.9976667)/(1.0023333) ≈ 0.995333.

So,

[ (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ]^2 ≈ (0.995333)^2 ≈ 0.9907.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

Which is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Ah, so this makes sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the direction of Star_2's velocity.

So the key here is whether Star_2 is moving towards us or away. In the first scenario, I assumed it was moving towards, which led to L1/L2≈2.27, which didn't match any options. But if Star_2 is moving away, the ratio is about 2.23, which matches option D.

So the correct approach is to determine the direction of Star_2's velocity.

In the problem statement, it's not specified whether Star_2's velocity is towards or away. Hmm. So perhaps I should check which scenario makes sense.

If the observed lambda_max is the same for both stars, and Star_2 is moving away, then its rest lambda must be shorter because of the redshift.

Wait, if Star_2 is moving away, its observed lambda is longer than its rest lambda. But since both observed lambdas are the same, Star_1's rest lambda must be shorter than Star_2's rest lambda. Because Star_1's observed lambda is its rest lambda, and Star_2's observed lambda is larger than its rest lambda.

Wait, no. Let me clarify.

If Star_2 is moving away, then λ_obs_2 = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

And λ_obs_1 = λ1_rest.

We set them equal: λ1_rest = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Which implies λ2_rest = λ1_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So, λ2_rest is smaller than λ1_rest.

Which implies T2 is higher than T1, because T is inversely proportional to lambda.

Wait, because λ2_rest < λ1_rest → T2 > T1.

But earlier, because Star_2 is moving away, which would make its observed lambda longer than its rest, but in this case, the observed is same as Star_1's rest.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong, but the calculation seems to lead to L1/L2 being approximately 2.23, which matches option D.

So, I think the correct answer is D) ~2.23.


--- Final Answer Content ---


Astronomers are analyzing the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2 and the same mass. The problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (λ_max) are the same. This implies that the observed λ_max for both stars is identical, but their rest wavelengths (λ_rest) may differ due to Doppler effects. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, while Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. The goal is to compute the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, assuming blackbody radiation.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Wien's Law and Temperature Relation**:  
   The peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the effective temperature \( T \), i.e., \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto \frac{1}{T} \). Since the observed λ_max for both stars is the same, the rest wavelengths must differ due to Doppler shifts. For Star_2, its rest wavelength is adjusted by its velocity.

2. **Doppler Shift Formula**:  
   The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}
   \]  
   where \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \). For Star_2, moving away from the observer with \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), the observed wavelength is longer than its rest wavelength. Setting \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \), we find:  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}}
   \]

3. **Temperature Ratio**:  
   Using \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} \propto \frac{1}{T} \), the temperature ratio is:  
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}
   \]  
   Squaring this gives:  
   \[
   \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}\right)^2
   \]

4. **Luminosity Ratio**:  
   The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:  
   \[
   L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
   \]  
   For the two stars, the luminosity ratio is:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
   \]  
   Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}\right)^2 \), we get:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot \left(\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}\right)^2
   \]

5. **Numerical Calculation**:  
   - \( \beta = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333 \)  
   - \( \frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta} \approx \frac{1.002333}{0.997667} \approx 1.004677 \)  
   - \( \left(\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}\right)^2 \approx (1.004677)^2 \approx 1.00937 \)  
   - Substituting into the luminosity ratio:  
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 1.00937 \approx 2.271
     \]

6. **Direction of Star_2's Velocity**:  
   If Star_2 is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer than its rest wavelength. This adjusts the rest wavelength of Star_2 to be shorter than Star_1's rest wavelength, leading to a slightly lower luminosity ratio. Recomputing with this adjustment gives \( \frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.23 \), which matches option D.

### Conclusion:
The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately **2.23**.
