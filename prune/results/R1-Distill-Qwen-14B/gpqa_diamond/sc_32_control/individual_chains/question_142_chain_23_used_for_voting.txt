Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located in the qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I think I should break this down. Let's write out the matrices for |0><0| and |1><1|. 

The |0><0| matrix is a 2x2 matrix where the (1,1) element is 1 and the others are 0. Similarly, |1><1| is a matrix where the (2,2) element is 1. So adding them together would give a matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere. Wait, no, each of these is a projection operator. So |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then multiplying by 1/2, the entire matrix becomes [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. Oh right, that's the density matrix for a completely mixed state.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubit space. I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I think the density matrix can be represented as a point in a 3-dimensional space, using the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch vector r has components (x, y, z), and it's related to the density matrix elements.

Density matrices for qubits are 2x2, and they can be written in terms of Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. Since I is the identity matrix, let me see. Our ρ is (I)/2, because (|0><0| + |1><1|) is I. So ρ is I/2. 

So substituting into the equation, I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2. Multiply both sides by 2, and I = I + r·σ. Subtract I from both sides, and we get r·σ = 0. Hmm, what does that mean for r? The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So r·σ = r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz = 0 matrix. 

The only way for the sum of these matrices multiplied by their components to be zero is if each component is zero. Because σx, σy, σz are all linearly independent. So r_x = 0, r_y = 0, r_z = 0. So the vector r is (0,0,0). 

Wait, but I should double-check. The density matrix for a completely mixed state is indeed the maximally mixed state, which is at the center of the Bloch sphere. So the center is the origin, so r is (0,0,0). 

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). That must be the correct answer.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the \(2 \times 2\) identity matrix. This represents a completely mixed state, which is the maximally mixed state for a qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix of a qubit can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we see that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), which implies that all components of \(\mathbf{r}\) must be zero (\(r_x = 0\), \(r_y = 0\), \(r_z = 0\)). This corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere, which is the geometrical position of a completely mixed state.

Thus, the density matrix \(\rho\) is located at \((0, 0, 0)\) in the qubit space.
