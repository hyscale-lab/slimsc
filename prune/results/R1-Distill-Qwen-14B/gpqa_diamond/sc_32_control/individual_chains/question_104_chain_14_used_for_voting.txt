Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift tells us about the planet's mass and orbital period.

The problem says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. So, the main differences are the observed Doppler shifts.

Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. We need to find how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, the RV method relates the semi-amplitude K of the Doppler shift to the planet's mass and the system's parameters. I think the formula is K = (v * sin i) where v is the star's velocity. But more importantly, the formula that connects K to the orbital period (P) is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P * (1 day in seconds)) )^(1/3) ) something like that. Wait, maybe I should think of the simplified version.

I recall that for circular orbits (e=0), the semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (G * P) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (2π) ) ) )

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the relationship between the semi-amplitude and the orbital period. Since the masses of the stars are the same (solar mass, M*), and the planet masses (M_p) are similar to Neptune, which is much less than the star's mass, so M* >> M_p. So, M* + M_p ≈ M*.

So, the formula simplifies. The semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p) * (P)^(-1/3) * (M*)^(-2/3) ) / (1 day in seconds... wait, perhaps I should write the formula more clearly.

The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( 1 / ( P ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps I should look for a more straightforward approach. Since both stars are identical, M* is same, and M_p is same (Neptune), the dependence of K on P comes from the fact that K is inversely proportional to P^{1/3}.

Wait, I think the relation is K proportional to (M_p) / (M_*)^{2/3} * (P)^{-1/3}.

Wait no, let me think again.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ] * [ (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]

Assuming that M_p << M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ ( (2π G)^(1/3) ) * (M_p)^(1) ) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) * c^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) * (2π)^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the proportionality.

Since M_* and M_p (Neptune) are the same for both planets, the only variables are the semi-amplitude K and the period P.

The equation relating K and P is K ∝ (M_p) / (M_* )^{2/3} * (1/ P^{1/3} )

But since M_p and M_* are the same for both planets, the ratio K1/K2 = sqrt( (P2/P1) ) * something? Wait, no. Let me think again. Let me write the formula correctly.

The correct formula is:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) ) * (1/(P c)) )^(1/3)

Assuming M_p << M_*, this simplifies to:

K ≈ (2π G / (c P ))^(1/3) * ( M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) )

So, K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), because the other terms are constants for both planets (same M_p, same M_*, same sin i, same c, etc.)

So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(-1/3 )

Taking the ratio of K1 to K2:

K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(-1/3 )

We can rearrange this to find P2 / P1.

Given that K1 is 5 milliangstroms and K2 is 7 milliangstroms.

So, K1 =5, K2=7.

So,

5/7 = (P2/P1 )^(-1/3 )

Take reciprocal on both sides:

7/5 = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

(7/5)^3 = P2/P1

Calculate (7/5)^3 = (343)/(125) ≈ 2.744

So, P2 = (343/125) * P1 ≈ 2.744 * P1.

Wait, that would mean that P2 is longer than P1. Because the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1, so the answer is approx 2.744. But looking at the options, I don't see that. The options are A) 0.36, B) 1.40, C)1.96, D)0.85.

Hmm, wait, perhaps I got the ratio reversed.

Wait, let me re-express this. From the formula, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So higher K means shorter P.

Because if K increases, P must decrease since K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

So, since K2 is larger than K1 (7 >5), Planet #2 must have a shorter orbital period than Planet #1.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is Planet #2's period than Planet #1's. So if P2 is shorter, the ratio would be less than 1.

Wait, let me go back.

Wait, the ratio of K1 to K2 is 5/7. So,

5/7 = (P2 / P1 )^(-1/3 )

Which is same as (P1 / P2 )^(1/3 ) = 5/7.

So,

P1 / P2 = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So, P1 is approximately 0.364 times P2. So P2 is longer than P1 by a factor of 1/0.364 ≈ 2.744. But none of the options are that.

Wait, but the options don't have 2.744. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that K is proportional to (M_p) * (P)^{-1/3}.

Wait, I think I might have the relationship reversed.

Wait, let's think of K as proportional to (M_p) / (M_*)^(2/3) * (1/(P))^(1/3).

Because the formula for K is:

K = (v) = [ (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1) * ( 1/(P) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it in terms of the formula:

K = ( (G * P) / (2π) )^(−1/3) ) * (M_p / (M_* )^(2/3) ) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(½) )

But since e=0, the denominator is 1.

Wait, to simplify, let's write K as proportional to (M_p) / (M_* )^(2/3) * (1/P )^(1/3 )

So, K ∝ M_p / (M_* )^(2/3) * (1/P )^(1/3 )

But since M_p and M_* are same for both, K ∝ (1/P )^(1/3 )

So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3 )

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Wait, that's different from before. Because if K1 =5, K2=7.

So,

5/7 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Take both sides to the power of 3:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

Which is 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1.

But the question is, how many times longer is the period of planet #2 than #1? So if P2 is 0.364 P1, that's shorter, so it's about 0.36 times as long. So the answer would be 0.36, option A.

Wait, but let me make sure.

So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3 )

So higher K means smaller P.

Given that K2 (7) is larger than K1 (5), P2 is smaller than P1.

So P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1.

Wait, no:

Wait, from K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Cube both sides:

125/343 = P2/P1 → P2 = (125/343) P1 → P2 ≈ 0.364 P1.

So planet #2 has a shorter period than planet #1. So the period of planet #2 is 0.364 times that of planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It would be 0.364 times, so about 0.36, which is option A.

So the answer should be A) ~0.36.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, we use the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), i.e., 

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}.
\]

Given that \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), the ratio of \( K_1 \) to \( K_2 \) is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}.
\]

Since \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), the ratio of the periods \( P_2 \) and \( P_1 \) is related by:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \), we get:

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Raising both sides to the power of 3:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}.
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \):

\[
\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \approx 0.364 \), meaning the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Therefore, Planet #2's orbital period is about 0.36 times as long as Planet #1's.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
