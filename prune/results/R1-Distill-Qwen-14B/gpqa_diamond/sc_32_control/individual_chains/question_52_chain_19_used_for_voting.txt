Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I need to think it through step by step. Alright, let's start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots.

Hmm. I remember that the ratio of populations in different energy levels in a star's photosphere is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor tells us how the number of particles in two energy states compares. The formula is something like n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, we're looking at the ratio when there are spots versus when there aren't. So when the star has spots, the overall temperature is lower. But the spots themselves are cooler regions, so does that affect the photosphere's average temperature?

Wait, the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So the star's overall temperature is lower when spots are present. That would affect the ionization and excitation states of atoms in the photosphere.

The specific transition they're talking about is between two energy levels that corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. Hmm, 1448 Å is in the near ultraviolet range. Titanium lines in this region... I'm not exactly sure, but the exact wavelength might not matter as much as the energy difference between the two levels.

So, the ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1 is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio R = (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). But wait, wait—actually, E2 and E1 are the energies of the two levels. If level 2 is higher than level 1 (E2 > E1), then as temperature increases, the ratio n2/n1 increases, because higher energy states are more populated when it's hotter.

Wait, but in this problem, when the star has spots, the overall T_eff decreases. So the photosphere's average T goes down. So the ratio n2/n1 would decrease as T decreases.

Wait, but the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when there are spots, the ratio is lower. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher. So the question is, by what factor does the ratio without spots exceed the ratio with spots.

The ratio change factor is R_no_spots / R_with_spots. Let's denote R1 as the ratio when there are no spots (T1=6000K), and R2 as the ratio when there are spots (T2=5500K). So the factor is R1 / R2.

Assuming that the statistical weights g2 and g1 are the same for both scenarios, because those are intrinsic to the energy levels and don't change with temperature. So g2/g1 is a constant factor in both R1 and R2.

So R1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T1) )
R2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( [ (E2 - E1)/(k) ) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] )

Wait, wait. Let me check that. Let's compute R1/R2.

R1/R2 = [ exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]

Which is the same as exp( [ (E2 - E1)/(k) ) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] )

Wait, no:

Because when you divide the exponents, subtract the exponents. So:

R1/R2 = exp( [ -(E2-E1)/(k T1) ) + (E2-E1)/(k T2) ] )

= exp( (E2 - E1)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, that's correct. Because:

exp(a)/exp(b) = exp(a - b) = exp( (a) - (b) )

So, (E2-E1)/(k T1) is the exponent for R1, and (E2-E1)/(k T2) is for R2. So when you take R1/R2, it's exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, no. Let me re-do this carefully.

R1 = exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T1) )

R2 = exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( [ - (E2-E1)/(k T1) + (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]

Factor out (E2-E1)/(k):

= exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

Wait no, no. Let me do it step by step.

R1/R2 = [exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]

= exp( [ -(E2-E1)/(k T1) ) + (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ] )

Because dividing exponents subtracts them. So:

= exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

Wait, let's see: 

The exponents are [ -(E2-E1)/(k T1) ) and + (E2-E1)/(k T2) ), so combining:

(E2-E1)/(k) [ (-1/T1) + (1/T2) ) ]

Which is (E2-E1)/(k) [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]

So, R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, but (1/T2 - 1/T1) will be negative because T2 < T1. So the exponent is negative, meaning that R1/R2 is less than 1? That doesn't make sense because when T decreases, the ratio R (n2/n1) should decrease. So when the star has spots (lower T), R2 is lower than R1. So R1 is higher than R2, meaning R1/R2 is greater than 1. Hmm, but according to the exponent, if (1/T2 - 1/T1) is negative, then (E2-E1)/(k) multiplied by a negative. If E2 > E1, which it is (since it's an upper level), then (E2-E1) is positive. So (positive) * (negative) is negative. So exp(negative) is a number less than 1. So R1/R2 would be less than 1. That can't be right because that would imply R1 < R2, which is the opposite of what we're seeing.

Wait, wait a minute. Maybe I got the order wrong. Let me think again.

The ratio R is n2/n1. Let's suppose level 2 is higher than level 1. So when T increases, the ratio increases. So when T decreases, the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots (T=5500 K), R is lower than when it doesn't (T=6000 K). So R1 is greater than R2. Therefore, R1/R2 is greater than 1.

But according to my earlier calculation, R1/R2 is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Which, as I said, if E2 > E1, and T2 < T1, then (1/T2 - 1/T1) is positive (since 1/T2 is bigger), so the exponent is positive. Therefore, R1/R2 = exp( positive ), which is greater than 1. So that makes sense. So it's correct.

So the factor is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

So, to compute this factor, I need to find the energy difference E2 - E1 corresponding to wavelength 1448 Å.

But wait, the energy of a photon is given by E = hc / λ. So the energy difference between the two levels is E2 - E1 = hc / λ.

So, let me compute that.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.62607015e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, about 2.99792458e8 m/s.

λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters, because 1 Å is 1e-10 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 J·s * 2.998e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m )

Let me compute that.

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = approx 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-25 / 1e-7 = approx 1.372 * 1e-18 J.

So E ≈ 1.372e-18 J per photon.

But wait, in the Boltzmann factor, we have (E2-E1)/(k T). Let's compute that.

k is Boltzmann's constant, about 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So (E2-E1)/(k) = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ (1.372 / 1.38) * 1e5 K ≈ 0.994 * 1e5 ≈ 9.94e4 K.

So (E2-E1)/(k) ≈ 9.94e4 K.

Now, compute (1/T2 - 1/T1) with T1=6000 K, T2=5500 K.

1/5500 ≈ 0.0001818 (approx 1.818e-4 K^-1)
1/6000 ≈ 0.0001667 (approx 1.667e-4 K^-1)
Difference: 1.818e-4 - 1.667e-4 = 1.51e-5 K^-1.

So (1/T2 - 1/T1) = 1.51e-5 K^-1.

So the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (9.94e4 K) * (1.51e-5 K^-1 )

Multiply these:

9.94e4 * 1.51e-5 = (9.94 * 1.51) * (1e4 * 1e-5) ) 

9.94 * 1.51 ≈ 15.01

1e4 * 1e-5 = 1e-1 = 0.1

So total exponent is 15.01 * 0.1 ≈ 1.501.

So the exponent is approximately 1.501.

Therefore, the factor R1/R2 is exp(1.501) ≈ e^1.501.

I know that e^1 is approx 2.718, e^0.5 is approx 1.6487.

So e^1.5 = e^(1) * e^(0.5) ≈ 2.718 * 1.6487 ≈ 4.48.

Wait, wait. Let me compute e^1.5 more accurately. 

Wait, 1.5 is 3/2. Let me think: 

e^1 = 2.718281828.

e^0.5 ≈ 1.648721271.

Multiplying them: 2.71828 * 1.64872 ≈ Let me compute step by step.

2.71828 * 1.64872

Let me compute 2.71828 * 1.6 = 4.34925.

2.71828 * 0.04872 ≈ 0.1323.

Adding together: 4.34925 + 0.1323 ≈ 4.48155.

So e^1.5 ≈ 4.48.

Wait, but wait. Our exponent was 1.501, so a little higher than 1.5. Let's compute e^1.501.

e^1.501 = e^(1.5 + 0.001) = e^1.5 * e^0.001.

e^0.001 ≈ 1.0010005. So 4.48 * 1.001 ≈ 4.484.

So the factor is about 4.48.

Looking back at the options:

Options are:

A) ~1.1

B) ~7.8

C) ~4.5

D) ~2.9

So approximately 4.48 is close to option C) ~4.5.

Wait, but I thought the exponent was 1.501, which gives e^1.501≈4.5. So the factor is about 4.5.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
R = \frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_2\) and \(g_1\) are the statistical weights of the levels, \(E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
\]

where \(R_1\) is the ratio when the star has no spots (\(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\)), and \(R_2\) is the ratio when the star has spots (\(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\)).

### Step 1: Energy difference between levels
The energy difference \(E_2 - E_1\) corresponds to the wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\). Using the relation \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(c = 2.998 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), we calculate:

\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(2.998 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to energy per unit temperature using \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\):

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 9.94 \times 10^4 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 2: Temperature term
The temperature term is:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}.
\]

Calculating:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} \approx 1.818 \times 10^{-4}, \quad \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.667 \times 10^{-4},
\]

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = 1.818 \times 10^{-4} - 1.667 \times 10^{-4} = 1.51 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

### Step 3: Exponent and factor
The exponent in the Boltzmann factor is:

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = (9.94 \times 10^4)(1.51 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 1.501.
\]

The factor is then:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp(1.501) \approx 4.48.
\]

### Step 4: Closest option
The closest option to the calculated factor is **C) ~4.5**.
