Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the uncertainty of P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. 

Alright, first, let me understand the setup. We have operators P_x, P_y, and P_z, each represented by a 3x3 matrix. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, the eigenstates of P_z are the basis states here. 

The matrix for P_x is given. The first row is (0, ℏ/√2, 0), second row (ℏ/√2, 0, ℏ/√2), third row (0, ℏ/√2, 0). Similarly, P_y has its matrix with some imaginary components. P_z's matrix is diagonal: (ℏ,0,0) in the first row, (0,0,0) in the second, and (0,0,-ℏ) in the third. Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck. P_z's matrix is first row (ℏ,0,0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-ℏ). Oh, I see, so P_z has eigenvalues ℏ, 0, and -ℏ. 

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ℏ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So, the state vector is |ψ> = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2)^T. 

I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z. Uncertainty in an operator is given by the square root of the expectation of the square minus the square of the expectation. So ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

But wait, since the state is given, maybe I can compute the expectation values directly.

So, first, let's compute ⟨P_z⟩, the expectation value of P_z.

The state |ψ> is a column vector. To compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩, I can calculate it as the conjugate transpose of |ψ> multiplied by P_z multiplied by |ψ>.

Wait, but the state is given as real numbers, so the conjugate transpose is the same as the transpose. Let me write down |ψ>:

|ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

So, the vector has three components: a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2.

P_z is a diagonal matrix: diag(ℏ, 0, -ℏ). So, when we apply P_z to |ψ>, we get a new vector where each component is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.

So, P_z |ψ> = [ ℏ*(-1/2), 0*(1/√2), (-ℏ)*(-1/2) ]^T = [ (-ℏ/2), 0, ℏ/2 ]^T.

Then, ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ is the dot product of ψ and P_z |ψ⟩.

So that's (-1/2)(-ℏ/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(ℏ/2).

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-1/2)*(-ℏ/2) = ℏ/4.

Second term: (1/√2)*0 = 0.

Third term: (-1/2)*(ℏ/2) = -ℏ/4.

Adding them up: ℏ/4 + 0 - ℏ/4 = 0. So, ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Wait, that's interesting. So the expectation value of P_z is zero.

Now, let's compute ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is diag(ℏ², 0, ℏ²). So, P_z² |ψ> would be [ ℏ²*(-1/2), 0, (-ℏ)^2*(-1/2) ]^T. Wait, no: (-ℏ)^2 is ℏ², so the third component is ℏ²*(-1/2) = -ℏ²/2. So, P_z² |ψ> is [ (-ℏ²/2), 0, (-ℏ²/2) ]^T.

Then, the expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩ is the dot product of ψ and P_z² |ψ>:

(-1/2)*(-ℏ²/2) + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*(-ℏ²/2).

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/2)(ℏ²/2) = ℏ²/(4).

Second term: 0.

Third term: (1/2)(ℏ²/2) = ℏ²/(4).

Adding them: ℏ²/4 + ℏ²/4 = ℏ²/2.

So, ⟨P_z²⟩ is ℏ²/2.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Because when you compute P_z squared, it's the square of each diagonal element. So P_z^2 is diag( (ℏ)^2, 0, (-ℏ)^2 ) = diag(ℏ², 0, ℏ^2).

So when you multiply P_z² with |ψ>, each component is multiplied by the respective squared term.

So P_z² |ψ> is:

First component: ℏ² * (-1/2) = -ℏ²/2.

Second component: 0 * (1/√2) = 0.

Third component: ℏ² * (-1/2) = -ℏ²/2.

Wait, so the vector is ( -ℏ²/2, 0, -ℏ²/2 ).

Now, the dot product with |ψ> is:

( -1/2 ) * (-ℏ²/2 ) + (1/√2 ) * 0 + ( -1/2 ) * ( -ℏ²/2 )

Which is (1/2)(ℏ²/2) + 0 + (1/2)(ℏ²/2) 

So each term is (ℏ²/4) and there are two terms, so total is ℏ²/2.

Yes, so ⟨P_z²⟩ is ℏ²/2.

Now, since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt(ℏ²/2 - 0) = sqrt(ℏ²/2) = ℏ / sqrt(2).

So the uncertainty is ℏ / sqrt(2). Let me check the options. Option B is ℏ/sqrt(2). So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in the ⟨P_z⟩ calculation.

Wait, for ⟨P_z⟩, the state is |ψ> = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2).

P_z |ψ> is [ℏ*(-1/2), 0, (-ℏ)*(-1/2) ]^T = [ -ℏ/2, 0, ℏ/2 ]^T.

Then, the inner product is (-1/2)(-ℏ/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(ℏ/2) 

Which is (ℏ/4) + 0 + (-ℏ/4) = 0. So that's correct.

Another way: Since P_z is diagonal in its own eigenbasis, and the given state is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis, the expectation value of P_z would be the sum of |c_i|^2 * λ_i, where λ_i are the eigenvalues.

Wait, the state in the P_z basis has components a, b, c. So ⟨P_z⟩ is |a|^2 * ℏ + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (-ℏ).

So |a|^2 is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. |c|^2 is also (1/2)^2 = 1/4. |b|^2 is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ℏ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ℏ) = (1/4 - 1/4)ℏ = 0. Yep, same result.

Now, ⟨P_z²⟩ is |a|^2 * ℏ^2 + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * ℏ^2.

Which is (1/4)*ℏ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ℏ² = (1/4 + 1/4) ℏ² = ℏ²/2.

So, yes, ΔP_z is sqrt(ℏ²/2) = ℏ / sqrt(2). So the correct answer is option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as $|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}$, and $P_z$ is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Applying $P_z$ to $|\psi\rangle$ gives:

\[
P_z |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar(-1/2) \\ 0(1/\sqrt{2}) \\ -\hbar(-1/2) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\hbar/2 \\ 0 \\ \hbar/2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The dot product of $\langle \psi |$ and $P_z |\psi\rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = (-1/2)(-\hbar/2) + (1/\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\hbar/2) = \hbar/4 + 0 - \hbar/4 = 0.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$.

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, which is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Applying $P_z^2$ to $|\psi\rangle$ gives:

\[
P_z^2 |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2(-1/2) \\ 0(1/\sqrt{2}) \\ \hbar^2(-1/2) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\hbar^2/2 \\ 0 \\ -\hbar^2/2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The dot product of $\langle \psi |$ and $P_z^2 |\psi\rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = (-1/2)(-\hbar^2/2) + (1/\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\hbar^2/2) = \hbar^2/4 + 0 + \hbar^2/4 = \hbar^2/2.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \hbar^2/2$.

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\hbar^2/2 - 0} = \sqrt{\hbar^2/2} = \hbar/\sqrt{2}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\hbar/\sqrt{2}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
