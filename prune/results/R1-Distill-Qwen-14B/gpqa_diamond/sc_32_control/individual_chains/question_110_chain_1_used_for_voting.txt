Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives five stars, each with different parameters, and I need to figure out which ones are observable by both instruments. The key points given are about their apparent magnitudes because each spectrograph has a brightness limit. Oh right, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, and HIRES can go down to brighter than 16. So, the apparent V magnitude of each star must be ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than..." so that's magnitude lower than the limit. Because lower magnitude means brighter. So for instance, if a star has V mag 17, ESPRESSO can't observe it because it's brighter than 17? Or wait, the wording is confusing. Oh no, wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed". So if a star's apparent V magnitude is less than 17, it's brighter than 17 mag? Wait, no, no. Wait, in astronomy, lower magnitude numbers mean brighter objects. So, a star with V=17 is fainter than one with V=16. So the statement is that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V ≤17? Because 17 is the maximum it can handle. Wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So, the maximum apparent magnitude is 17? Because anything brighter (lower magnitude) is okay.

Wait, let me parse that. "With ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So, if a star has an apparent V magnitude of 16, that's brighter than 17, so it can be observed. If it's 17, that's equal, so maybe not. Or perhaps "brighter than" includes up to and including 17. Hmm, the wording isn't entirely clear, but I think it's that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V ≤17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with V ≤16. Because "brighter than 16 mag" meaning up to 16. So, the apparent V magnitude must be less than or equal to 16 for HIRES and less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO.

So, the first step is to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star, considering any extinction (dust reddening) because some stars have E(B-V) given. Oh right, because extinction affects the apparent magnitude. The formula for extinction is Av = 3.1 * E(B-V). So, the observed apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (or absolute) magnitude plus Av. Wait, no, wait. Apparent magnitude is affected by distance and extinction. Oh wait, for each star, if they give apparent magnitude, that's already after considering distance, but if they give absolute magnitude, I need to calculate the apparent magnitude using the distance modulus and then account for extinction.

Wait, let's clarify each star's parameters:

Star1: Absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. No E(B-V) given, so no extinction.

So, the apparent magnitude is calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d/10). So for 10 pc, log(1) is 0, so m = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5. So apparent V is 15.5. Since 15.5 ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES? 15.5 is less than 16, so it's okay for HIRES. So Star1 is observable by both, right?

Star2: Apparent V mag 16.5. So m=16.5. HIRES can do up to 16, so 16.5 is brighter than 16? Wait, wait, no. 16.5 is higher than 16, which means it's fainter. Because lower magnitude is brighter. So 16 is brighter than 17. So HIRES can't observe this because 16.5 is fainter than 16. But ESPRESSO can, because 16.5 ≤17. So Star2 can be observed only by ESPRESSO, not by HIRES. So it's not a candidate for both.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5, but has E(B-V)=0.6. So extinction in V is Av=3.1 *0.6=1.86. So the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + Av. Wait, no, wait. Absolute magnitude is M, and apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + Av. Wait, no, no. Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, for a star, the apparent magnitude without extinction is m0 = M + 5 log(d/10) + 5. Because M is the absolute magnitude, which is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc. So, yes, m0 = M + 5 log(d/10). Then, when extinction is added, the observed apparent magnitude is m = m0 + Av. Because extinction makes the star appear dimmer (higher magnitude).

So, for Star3: M = 15.5? Wait, no, Star3's data says: apparent V mag of 15.5, E(B-V) = 0.6. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, looking back: Star3's data is:

- RA = 11h, DEC =48 deg, apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6, distance 15 pc.

Wait, so the apparent magnitude is already given as 15.5, but I also have to account for extinction. Because the apparent magnitude is what's observed, but if there's extinction, the intrinsic magnitude is fainter. Or wait, no. Wait, the E(B-V) is the color excess, which tells us how much extinction there is. So the observed apparent magnitude is affected by extinction. Or, perhaps the given 15.5 is the observed magnitude. So, to find the intrinsic (or what it would be without extinction), I would subtract Av.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The extinction (Av) is the amount by which the star's apparent magnitude increases (because it's dimmer). So the observed magnitude (m_observed) is the intrinsic magnitude (m_intrinsic) plus Av. So m_observed = m_intrinsic + Av.

Wait, but for Star3, the given apparent magnitude is 15.5. But is that the observed magnitude (including extinction) or the intrinsic (without)? The question says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag". So that's the observed value. So the extinction would make it appear fainter than it actually is. So the intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) would be m_intrinsic = m_observed - Av. So m_intrinsic = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. But wait, why would we need that? Because when considering detection, the instrument's limit is the apparent magnitude that they observe. So for Star3, the observed m is 15.5. So it's within both instruments' limits. Wait, let me see.

Wait, the spectrographs can detect stars with apparent magnitudes ≤17 (ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (HIRES). So Star3 has m=15.5, which is ≤16 and ≤17. So it can be detected by both. But wait, no—wait, no, because extinction affects only the observed magnitude. If a star is behind dust, it's dimmer, so its observed m is higher (fainter). So the given m is 15.5 for Star3, which is the observed magnitude. So, regardless of extinction, that's what the instruments measure. Wait, but if a star's true m (without extinction) is lower, but because of extinction, it's higher, making it fainter. So, for example, suppose a star's true m is 14.5, but extinction makes it 16.5. So, its observed m is 16.5. If the instrument's limit is 17, it can see it, but if the limit is 16, it can't.

So, for Star3, the observed m is 15.5, which is within both. So it can be detected by both.

Wait, but wait, Star3's data says 'apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1.' Oh wait, so perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the apparent magnitude, considering the absorption. Because the given apparent magnitude is the observed one, or is it the intrinsic?

No, the question says, 'apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us.' So that's the observed apparent magnitude. But wait, the 'E(B-V)' is given, so perhaps the given 15.5 is the intrinsic apparent magnitude, and we have to add the extinction to find the observed m.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's go back. The problem statement says, 'for the sake of simplicity, let's disregard the pointing limits and altitudes.' But we have to consider the extinction (E(B-V)) for some stars.

So, for stars with E(B-V), we have to compute their apparent V magnitude, considering the extinction. Let me go through each star.

Star1:

- Mv =15.5, distance 10 pc.

Apparent magnitude without extinction: m = Mv + 5 log10(d/10) = 15.5 +5 log(1) = 15.5 +0=15.5.

E(B-V)=0, so no extinction. So m =15.5.

Both ESPRESSO (m ≤17) and HIRES (m ≤16) can detect it. So Star1 is a candidate.

Star2:

- m =16.5, distance 5 pc. But wait, that's the apparent magnitude, so no need to compute distance modulus, because it's already observed.

E(B-V) not given, so no extinction. So m=16.5.

HIRES can go up to 16, so 16.5 is beyond that. So HIRES can't detect it. ESPRESSO can, as 16.5 ≤17.

So Star2 is detected only by ESPRESSO.

Star3:

- RA and DEC given, but those don't matter for apparent magnitude.

Apparent V mag is 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So, is this the observed m or the intrinsic? The question says 'apparent V magnitude of 15.5', so that's the observed. So I think we don't need to compute anything, because m is already given as 15.5. But wait, that can't be right, because E(B-V) is given. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the given apparent V mag is the intrinsic (without extinction), and we have to calculate the observed m by adding Av. Because sometimes the given apparent magnitude is the unreddened (intrinsic) magnitude, and extinction makes it appear fainter.

So, Star3: Mv apparent = 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6, so Av=3.1*0.6=1.86. So the observed m is 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36.

Wait, that would make m=17.36, which is fainter than ESPRESSO's limit of 17. So it's beyond what ESPRESSO can detect. So Star3's observed m is 17.36, which is too faint for both. But that can't be right because the options include Star3 as a possible candidate.

Wait, maybe I got it backwards. If the star's apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, that's already the observed (reddened) magnitude. So no need to adjust. So m=15.5. So both spectrographs can detect it.

Alternatively, perhaps the apparent magnitude given is the intrinsic, and extinction makes it redder (higher m). So for Star3, the observed m would be 15.5 +1.86=17.36, which is too faint for both.

Wait, that can't be right because the options don't include Star3 and Star5, but perhaps I'm getting the scenario wrong.

Wait, let me re-express the problem.

The question says: which stars can be detected with both spectrographs. So, each star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (for HIRES). So, the star must have m ≤16 for both to be detected.

Wait, but if a star's m is ≤16, then it's within the limits of both, because ESPRESSO can go up to 17. So, any star with m ≤16 can be detected by both. But some stars have m between 16 and 17, which can be detected only by ESPRESSO.

So, the key is that a star must have m ≤16 to be detected by both.

Wait, but Star1 has m=15.5, which is ≤16. So both can detect it.

Star2 has m=16.5, which is above the HIRES limit, so only ESPRESSO can detect it.

Star3: apparent V mag 15.5. If that's the observed, then m=15.5, so both can detect. But if it's the intrinsic, then m_observed would be 15.5 +1.86=17.36, which is beyond both.

So, I think the given apparent magnitude in the question is the observed magnitude, so no need to adjust for extinction again. Because E(B-V) is given for some stars, perhaps that affects the apparent magnitude.

Wait, no. Because the apparent magnitude is observed, so E(B-V) is already included in that value. Or wait, no. The E(B-V) is the color excess, which is the difference between the observed color and the intrinsic color. So, to find the extinction in V, you calculate Av = 3.1 * E(B-V). So, the observed V magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + Av.

But if the question gives the apparent magnitude (m_observed), then you don't need to adjust it further. So, for Star3, m_observed is 15.5. So, it's within both instruments' limits.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (without extinction), and we have to add the extinction to get the observed m. So, for Star3, m_observed = 15.5 +1.86 =17.36, which is too faint for both spectrographs. So Star3 can't be detected by either.

But that seems contradictory because the options have Star3 listed in some choices.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at each star one by one.

Let me make a table:

Star | Mv | Distance (pc) | E(B-V) | RA, DEC | Apparent V mag (given, m) | Av | Observed m | Detectable by ESPRESSO? | Detectable by HIRES?
-----|---|-------------|--------|---------|--------------------------|---|------------|-------------------------|-------------------------
1 |15.5 |10 |0 |15, -75 |15.5 (calculated) |0 |15.5 |Yes (≤17) |Yes (≤16)
2 | - |5 |0 |30, 55 |16.5 |0 |16.5 |Yes |No (16.5 >16)
3 | - |15 |0.6 |11h,48 |15.5 |1.86 |15.5+1.86=17.36? Or is m=15.5 already observed? |17.36>17 → No | N/A
Wait, but I'm confused about whether the given m is observed or not.

Alternatively, maybe for Star3, the given m is the apparent magnitude, so no need to add Av.

Wait, the problem says: Star3's data includes E(B-V)=0.6, which affects the V band.

So perhaps the given m is the intrinsic apparent magnitude, and the observed m is higher.

Wait, but what's the correct approach? I think the given m is the observed (apparent) magnitude, which already includes the effects of extinction. So, for Star3, m=15.5 is observed, so no extinction adjustment needed. So Star3 is detectable by both.

Wait, but that may not make sense because usually, when you are given E(B-V), you adjust the magnitudes. But perhaps in this problem, the apparent magnitude given is already the extinction-corrected (intrinsic) magnitude. So to get the observed m, you have to add Av.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of it this way: when a star has extinction, its observed apparent magnitude is higher (fainter) than the actual. So, if a star's actual (intrinsic) apparent magnitude is m, then the observed m_observed = m + Av.

So, if Star3's apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, and Av=1.86, then the observed m is 15.5 +1.86=17.36, which is beyond ESPRESSO's limit. So Star3 can't be detected.

But that would make Star3 not detectable by either. But looking at the options, that would mean options C and B are possible, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent magnitude in the problem is the observed (extinction-included) magnitude. So, no need to adjust. So Star3's m=15.5 is after extinction, so it's acceptable.

But why is E(B-V) given then? Because the problem statement provides E(B-V) for some stars, but not all. So perhaps for Star3, the apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, but we need to correct it for extinction to get the intrinsic, then compute the apparent magnitude. Wait, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the "intrinsic" (without extinction), and the observed is higher. So for Star3, m_intrinsic =15.5, but Av=1.86, so observed m=17.36. So, it's too faint for both.

But then, how about Star4: RA=85, DEC=-48, Mv=15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, distance 10 pc.

So, Mv =15.5, distance 10 pc. So, without extinction, m =15.5 +0=15.5.

With E(B-V)=0.4, Av=3.1 *0.4=1.24. So observed m=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So, m=16.74. HIRES can't detect (needs m ≤16), but ESPRESSO can (m ≤17). So Star4 is detectable only by ESPRESSO.

Star5: RA=10h, DEC=60, Mv=16.5, distance 5 pc.

Apparent magnitude: m = Mv +5 log10(5/10) =16.5 +5 log(0.5)=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505≈15.0.

E(B-V) not given, so no extinction. So m=15.0. So, both spectrographs can detect it.

Wait, Star5's m is 15.0, which is within both HIRES (≤16) and ESPRESSO (≤17).

So, let's summarize each star's m and detectability:

Star1: m=15.5 → detectable by both.

Star2: m=16.5 → detectable by ESPRESSO only.

Star3: If m_observed is given as 15.5, then detectable by both. But if m_intrinsic is 15.5, then m_observed=17.36 → not detectable by either.

Star4: m_observed=16.74 → detectable by ESPRESSO only.

Star5: m=15.0 → detectable by both.

Now, the question is, which stars can be detected by both spectrographs. So, which stars have m ≤16 (for both), and m ≤17 (which is a larger limit, so if m is ≤16, it's automatically ≤17).

Looking at the stars:

Star1: m=15.5 → detectable by both.

Star3: depends on whether m is observed. If given m is after extinction, then yes. If given as before, then no.

But in the problem statement, it says for Star3: apparent V magnitude of 15.5 and E(B-V)=0.6. So, the E(B-V) is given, which suggests that we have to calculate the extinction and adjust the apparent magnitude. So I think the given m is the intrinsic (without extinction), and the observed m is higher.

So for Star3: m_observed =15.5 +1.86=17.36. Which is >17, so not detectable by either.

So Star3 cannot be detected by either.

Star5: m=15.0, which is within both.

So, stars detectable by both: Star1, Star5.

Wait, looking back, Star1 has m=15.5 and Star5 has m=15.0.

So, which options have these stars?

Looking at the options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4's m is 16.74 → detectable only by ESPRESSO. So A is incorrect.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3's m=17.36, not detectable. So B is incorrect.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2's m=16.5, detectable only by ESPRESSO. Star3 not detectable. So C is incorrect.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 is detectable by both. Star4's m=16.74, detectable only by ESPRESSO. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but none of the options have Star1 and Star5. Hmm. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

Wait, according to my analysis, Star1 (m=15.5) is detectable by both, Star5 (m=15.0) is detectable by both. But none of the options pair them. The options are A (4 and5), B (3 and5), C (2 and3), D (1 and4).

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated Star1's m.

Star1: Mv=15.5, distance 10 pc.

m = Mv +5 log10 (d/10) =15.5 +5 log(1) =15.5.

No extinction, so m=15.5.

So, Star1 is detectable by both.

Star5: Mv=16.5, distance 5 pc.

m =16.5 +5 log(5/10)=16.5 +5*(log(0.5)) =16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995≈15.0.

No extinction, so m=15.0.

So both Star1 and Star5 have m's within both instruments.

But the options don't have an option that includes both.

Wait, the options are A to D. Let me check each option:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4's m=16.74, which is detectable only by ESPRESSO. Star5's m=15.0, detectable by both. So, this option includes Star5, which is detectable by both. But Star4 is not. So, the option is incorrect because the question asks which stars can be detected by both. So, if a star in the option is detectable by only one, the option is invalid.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3's m=17.36, not detectable. So option B is invalid.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 is detectable by ESPRESSO only, Star3 not. So option C invalid.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 is detectable by both, Star4 is detectable only by ESPRESSO. So option D is invalid.

Wait, but none of the options have Star1 and Star5. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis. Let me re-examine Star3.

Alternative approach: perhaps the given apparent magnitude for Star3 is the observed (after extinction). So m=15.5 is observed, and E(B-V) is given but doesn't affect the detectability because it's already accounted for.

In that case, Star3's m=15.5 is acceptable for both spectrographs, so Star3 is detectable by both.

So, which stars can be detected by both?

Star1: 15.5 → both.

Star3: 15.5 → both.

Star5: 15.0 → both.

So the stars detectable by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Looking at the options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 is no.

B) Star3 and Star5 → yes! Both detectable by both.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 no.

So option B includes Star3 and Star5, both of which are detectable by both spectrographs.

Wait, but according to this, Star3's m is 15.5, which is within both. So why is E(B-V) given? Because perhaps the apparent magnitude given is the intrinsic, and the observed is higher.

Wait, but if the given m is the observed (already accounting for extinction), then Star3's m=15.5 is acceptable.

In that case, the correct stars detectable by both are Star1, Star3, Star5.

Looking at the options, option B is Star3 and Star5. So that's a correct pair.

But wait, Star1 is also detectable by both. So, why isn't an option including Star1 and Star5?

Looking back at the options:

Option D: Star1 and Star4.

Star4's m=16.74 → detectable only by ESPRESSO.

So, option D is incorrect.

Option B: Star3 and Star5.

If Star3's m is 15.5 (observed), then both can detect. Star5's m=15.0, so both can detect. So option B is correct.

But wait, how about Star3's m being 15.5. Since the given m is 15.5, and whether extinction has to be added.

Ah, perhaps the question treats the given m as observed (including extinction). So Star3's m=15.5, E(B-V) is given but doesn't affect detection. So, Star3 is detectable by both.

Therefore, the stars detectable by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Looking at the options, option B is Star3 and Star5, which are both detectable. So option B is correct.

Wait, but what about Star5's m? Star5 has Mv=16.5, distance 5 pc. So m=16.5 +5 log(5/10) =16.5 +5*(-0.301)=16.5-1.505≈14.995, which is 15.0. So, m=15.0, which is within both.

So, stars detectable by both are Star1, Star3, Star5.

But the options don't have a pair of Star1 and Star5, but option B has Star3 and Star5.

So, the answer would be option B.

Wait, but earlier I thought Star3's m is 15.5, which is detectable, but the extinction adjusts it to 17.36 if the given m is the intrinsic. So, this is a crucial point.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is in how I interpret the given m for Star3. If the given m is the apparent (observed), then no extinction adjustment is needed. But if the given m is the absolute (intrinsic), then I have to add extinction. Let's re-express the problem.

The problem gives for each star:

- For Star1: absolute V mag, distance.

So, we calculate m.

- For Star2: apparent V mag, distance, but E(B-V) not given.

- For Star3: apparent V mag, E(B-V), distance.

- For Star4: absolute V mag, E(B-V), distance.

- For Star5: absolute V mag, distance.

So, for Star3, the given m is the apparent (observed), so no need to adjust. Because the problem states the apparent V magnitude. So, for Star3, m=15.5 is already observed. So, E(B-V) is provided, but that's just extra information that may not affect the detection because the m is already given as observed.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if E(B-V) is given, then the m would already have been adjusted for extinction. So perhaps the given m is the observed, and E(B-V) is extra info but not needed for calculation.

In that case, Star3's m=15.5 is within both's limits.

Similarly, Star4:

Mv=15.5, distance=10 pc, E(B-V)=0.4.

m_intrinsic =15.5 +0=15.5.

Av=3.1 *0.4=1.24.

m_observed=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So, m=16.74. Which is above HIRES's limit (16), so only ESPRESSO can detect it.

So, stars detectable by both:

Star1 (15.5), Star3 (15.5), Star5 (15.0).

So, which options include pairs where both stars are detectable by both?

Looking at the options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both detectable.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 not.

So, the correct answer would be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤17, while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤16. Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detectable by both spectrographs.

### Analysis of Each Star:

- **Extinction (E(B-V)):** 0.6  
- **Extinction in V band (Av):** \( A_v = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.6 = 1.86 \).  
- **Observed m:** The problem states that the apparent V magnitude is already given, so no further adjustment is needed.

- **Extinction (E(B-V)):** 0.4  
- **Apparent V magnitude (m):**  
  Using the distance modulus formula, \( m = M_v + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) \),  
  \( m = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5 \).  
- **Extinction adjustment:** \( A_v = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24 \).  
- **Observed m:** \( m_{\text{observed}} = m + A_v = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 \).  
- **Detectable by:** ESPRESSO (16.74 ≤ 17) but not HIRES (16.74 > 16).  

#### **Star5**
- **Absolute V magnitude (Mv):** 16.5  
- **Distance:** 5 pc  
- **Extinction (E(B-V)):** 0  
- **Apparent V magnitude (m):**  
  Using the distance modulus formula, \( m = M_v + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) \),  
  \( m = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 + 5(-0.301) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0 \).  
- **Extinction adjustment:** None (E(B-V) = 0).  
- **Observed m:** 15.0  
- **Detectable by:** Both ESPRESSO (15.0 ≤ 17) and HIRES (15.0 ≤ 16).  

### Conclusion:
- **Stars detectable by both spectrographs:** Star1 (m = 15.5), Star3 (m = 15.5), and Star5 (m = 15.0).  
- **Option Analysis:**  
  - **A) Star4 and Star5:** Star4 (m = 16.74) is detectable only by ESPRESSO. Incorrect.  
  - **B) Star3 and Star5:** Both stars (m = 15.5 and m = 15.0) are detectable by both spectrographs. Correct.  
  - **C) Star2 and Star3:** Star2 (m = 16.5) is detectable only by ESPRESSO. Incorrect.  
  - **D) Star1 and Star4:** Star4 (m = 16.74) is detectable only by ESPRESSO. Incorrect.  

**Final Answer:**  
The correct option is **B) Star3 and Star5**.
