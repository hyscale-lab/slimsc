Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to figure out which one matches the given data.

Let me start by looking at each of the characterization techniques provided.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like from alcohols or carboxylic acids. If it's a very broad peak, maybe it's a strong O-H group, like in a carboxylic acid. The other peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 region suggests a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might suggest conjugation. For example, in a conjugated carbonyl group like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone or maybe an ester, or perhaps a carbonyl next to an aromatic ring?

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond somewhere.

The mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass. Let me think about the possible fragments. M/z 45 could be from a CH3CO group (like acetate), because CH3CO+ has a mass of 45. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde group, but I'm not sure. Wait, 45 is also the mass of the fragment from a ketone or ester, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Now, let's think about each option and see which fits.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible functional groups could be esters or maybe a diol with an ether. But given the IR peaks, the broad peak suggests an O-H, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, an ester might not have a broad peak but a strong O-H could come from a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it's an ester, the O-H would be from somewhere else... Or perhaps it's a hemiacetal or something else. Wait, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone? That could have both a carbonyl and an O-H.

Option B: C6H10O. The degrees of unsaturation would be (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees of unsaturation. That could be one double bond and one ring, or two double bonds. But wait, the NMR mentions vinyl hydrogens, so probably a double bond. So maybe a cyclic ether with a double bond? Or an alkene and an ether?

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So same as B. But with two oxygen atoms. Possible structures could be an ester (R-O-CO-R') which would have a carbonyl and an O. Or a diol with an ester group? Or maybe a cyclic ester again.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6+2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree, which could be a ring or a double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. So perhaps an alcohol with a double bond.

Now, let's go back to the IR. The broad peak at 3000 is probably an O-H stretch. The strong peak at 1700 is a carbonyl. The 1650 suggests maybe conjugation or another carbonyl group. Wait, but could it be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds? Like an aromatic ring with substituents causing the peak around 1650? Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, if the compound has a carbonyl (like a ketone or ester), and also a double bond (from vinyl H's), then perhaps it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or ketone. For example, something like methyl acrylate or similar.

Looking at the IR data again: 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is probably a carbonyl (C=O). The 1650 could be a conjugated double bond, or possibly an aromatic ring. But the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so it's more likely a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl. So that's an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound.

In that case, let's think about the possible structures. For example, methyl acrylate (CH2=CHCOOCH3). But let's check the molecular formulas.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular formula would be something like C6H10O2 if it's an ester with a double bond. Wait, what's the molecular formula of methyl acrylate? Acrylic acid is CH2=CHCOOH, methyl ester is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So formula is C4H6O2. That's not matching any of the options except if the compound is larger.

Wait, the options are C6, so maybe the molecule is bigger. Let's think of something like cyclohexene with an ester group or a ketone.

Wait, another thought. The mass spec shows a peak at m/z 45. Let me think about what that could be. So the molecular ion or a fragment. 45 could be (CH3)2CO+ (acetone) with mass 58, but wait, 45 is less. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like CH3CO-O- or something else.

Wait, molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. Its molecular weight would be 6*12 +10 +32=72 +10+32=114. The mass spectrum's m/z 45 is a fragment. So maybe a fragment with molecular weight 45. Could that be a part of the molecule? For example, if the compound is an ester, the ester group (like O-CO-O) but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diester or something else. Let me think about possible structures.

Wait, another approach: the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which is O-H. So the compound must have an -OH group. So looking at the options, which contain O and possibly an alcohol group.

Option D is C6H12O, which could be an alcohol, perhaps with a double bond. But in that case, the IR would show a broad O-H peak, the 1700 could be a carbonyl, but wait, D's formula is C6H12O. That's 6 carbons, 12 H, 1 O. So molecular weight would be (6*12)+12 +16 =72+12+16=100. But the mass spec peak is 45, which is about half. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ether with a carbonyl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the IR again. The 1700 is probably a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester. But if there's a broad peak, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But then, for a carboxylic acid, the O-H peak would be very broad, which matches the first IR data. The 1700 could be the C=O stretch of the acid.

So, if it's a carboxylic acid, then the formula would have at least two O's. Wait, a carboxylic acid has the formula RCOOH, which is CnH2nO2. So the formula would be C6H12O2, which is option A.

But wait, in the options, option A is C6H12O2. So its molecular formula is C6H12O2. That would match a carboxylic acid if it's RCOOH. So, a hexanoic acid, for example, would have C6H12O2. But then, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. Hexanoic acid doesn't have a double bond. So perhaps it's a substituted carboxylic acid with a double bond nearby.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester (lactone). For example, a cyclic ester would have a carbonyl (from the ester) and an O-H (if it's a gamma or delta lactone, which would have an O-H). So, for example, a five-membered ring lactone would have a structure like an ester. But then, would it have a double bond?

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so the compound has a double bond. So perhaps it's a cyclic ester with a double bond, like a cyclic alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, a cyclic structure where the ester is conjugated to a double bond.

Another thought: the mass spec peak at m/z 45. Let's calculate the possible fragment. If the compound is an ester, a fragment could be the acylium ion, like (CH3CO)+ would be 45. So if the compound is an ester with an acetyl group (like CH3COOR), then the fragment would be 45.

So the presence of a 45 fragment suggests maybe an acetyl group somewhere. So perhaps the compound has an acetyl group attached to something else.

Let me think about the options again.

Option A: C6H12O2. If it's a hexanoic acid, it's RCOOH, but without a double bond. But the NMR says vinyl hydrogens, implying a double bond. So maybe it's a substituted acid with a double bond. For example, CH2CH2COOH but that doesn't make sense. Or maybe it's a di-substituted acid with a double bond, like CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. But that's a five-carbon acid. Wait, the formula is C6H12O2. Let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation.

Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) for C6H12O2: DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring or a double bond.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which is a double bond. So in this case, the DoU must come from a double bond. So if the compound has a double bond and an O-H (from the acid), that uses up the DoU.

So the structure would be an unsaturated carboxylic acid, like CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. Let's calculate the formula for that. CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH is C5H8O2. But our option is C6H12O2, which has more carbons and more H. So perhaps it's a cyclohexene ring with a carboxylic acid group attached. For example, cyclohexene carboxylic acid.

Wait, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a double bond. So cyclohexene carboxylic acid would be C6H10O2. Wait, but our options for A is C6H12O2. So that can't be right. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted carboxylic acid with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the compound is methyl vinyl ketone? No, that's an ester. Wait, methyl vinyl ketone is (CH2=CH)COCH3, which is C4H6O. But that doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option and see which fits all the data.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of Unsaturation is 1. So either a ring or a double bond. Since the NMR shows vinyl H's, it's a double bond. So the structure would have a double bond and an O-H (from the acid). But the formula for a six-carbon, double bond, and O-H would be C6H10O2. Hmm, but the formula is C6H12O2. How does that add up?

Wait, if it's an acid, the formula would be CnH2nO2. But if there's a double bond, each double bond or ring reduces two H's. So if the formula is C6H12O2, without any rings, the H would be 14 (since n=6: 2*6 +2=14). But the formula is H12, which is 14-2*1=12. So it has one degree of unsaturation, which could be a double bond or a ring. But it also has O-H.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid group. Let's see: cyclopentane has five carbons, so the sixth would be the COOH. So structure like cyclopentyl carboxylic acid. Its formula would be C6H10O2. But the formula here is C6H12O2. So that's not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclohexene ring with a substituent. Wait, cyclohexene is C6H10. If it's attached to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, that would change the formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diol ester or something else. But I'm getting confused.

Let me try another approach. Looking at the mass spec fragment, m/z 45. 45 is C3H7O. Wait, wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. Let's calculate: C=12, H=1, O=16. So 45 could be CH2COO- (but that's 45? Let me check. CH3COO- is 12*2 + 1*3 + 16 = 24 +3 +16=43. Close but not 45. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH2)2CO, which would be 45? Let me see: (CH2)2CO is C3H6O. 3*12=36, 6=6, O=16. Total 58. No. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be (CH3)2CO (acetone) which is (2*12) + (6) + (16) =24 +6 +16=46. Not 45. Close, but not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's CH3COOH (acetic acid), but that's 60. No. Alternatively, maybe it's CH3CHO (acetaldehyde), which is 44. That's close to 45, but not quite. Hmm.

Wait, what about a fragment where something else is going on. Maybe the molecule has a group that breaks off to form the 45 fragment. For example, if the compound is an ester, perhaps the ester group breaks into a smaller fragment. The acylium ion would be the RCO+ group.

If the ester is something like R-O-CO-R', the fragment could be RCO+ or R'CO+.

Wait, if the fragment is 45, which is the mass of the acylium ion, then RCO+ would have a mass of 45. So RCO would be 45-12=33. Wait, no, RCO is the group, so RCO+ is 45. So RCO has a molecular weight of 44. Because 45 is the mass of the ion, which includes the positive charge.

Wait, molecular formula of RCO would be CxHyO. Let me see: 45 = (12x + y + 16). So 12x + y +16 =45 → 12x + y =29.

Looking for x and y integers:

x=2 → 24 + y=29 → y=5 → C2H5O? That would be O=C2H5. But that's not a possible group. Alternatively, x=1 →12 + y=29-16=13 → 12 + y=13 → y=1. So C1H1O: that would be CHO, formaldehyde. Wait, but formaldehyde is HCHO. The acylium ion would be HCO+ which is 29, not 45. Hmm, maybe I'm not thinking this through correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the 45 comes from a different source. Maybe a CH3CO-O- group. So, the ester group. The fragment of the ester could be the acylium ion, CH3CO+ would be 43 (12*2 + 3 + 16= 24+3+16=43?), but wait, 43 is less than 45. Hmm. Maybe the fragment is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the 45 is the molecular ion of a fragment that's a ketone. For example, acetone is (CH3)2CO, which has a molecular weight of 58. Not 45.

Wait, another idea: if the compound is a diester, it might break into smaller fragments. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 45 comes from a different functional group. Let me think about the options again.

Looking back, the IR shows a broad peak at 3000 (O-H), so it's either an alcohol, carboxylic acid, or maybe an amine (but the NMR shows vinyl H, so probably not amine). The other peaks at 1700 and 1650 suggest a carbonyl. So maybe ester or ketone.

If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad. Then, the 1700 would be the C=O of the acid. The 1650 could be something else. But wait, the NMR has vinyl H, so a double bond is present.

So, the compound would have a carboxylic acid group, a double bond, and some other structure. The formula, if it's a six-carbon acid with a double bond, would be C6H10O2. Because a carboxylic acid is CnH2nO2. If there's a double bond (which reduces two H), then it's CnH2n-2O2. So for n=6, it's C6H10O2. That's option C.

Wait, but looking back at the options, which one is C6H10O2? Option C is C6H10O2.

But wait, the options are:

A) C6H12O2

B) C6H10O

C) C6H10O2

D) C6H12O

So if the formula is C6H10O2, that's option C.

Let me check the degrees of unsaturation. For C6H10O2: DoU = (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees of unsaturation. That could be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, or one double bond and a carbonyl group. Wait, but a carbonyl is a double bond (C=O). So if the compound has a C=O group and a double bond (from the vinyl H), that would account for two DoU. So for example, a structure like CH2=CHCOOHCH2CH2CH3, but that's 6 carbons? Let me see: CH2=CHCOOH would be 3 carbons (but that's propenoic acid, which is 3 carbons, but our compound is 6. So maybe it's a longer chain with a double bond and a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic structure with a double bond and a carbonyl. For example, a cyclopentene ring with a ketone group. But then, would that fit the functional groups?

Wait, in this scenario, the IR shows 1700 and 1650. If it's a cyclopentene with a ketone, the 1700 would be the ketone's C=O. The 1650 could be the conjugated double bond in the ring. So that could fit. But then, the O-H absorption would be from where? Unless it's an alcohol. But then, the formula would need to have an O-H group.

Wait, another possibility is that the compound is an ester with a double bond. Esters have a carbonyl group. If the ester group is conjugated with a double bond, the C=O peak would be at a lower wavenumber, maybe around 1700 and 1650. So for example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

So the structure would be something like CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is a substituent.

Let me think about the formula of such a compound. Let's say R is a propyl group. Then, the formula would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. That's C6H10O2. Which matches option C. So that would fit.

In terms of IR: the broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ could be from an O-H somewhere else, but wait, in an ester, the O-H is not present unless it's a hemiacetal or something else. Alternatively, maybe the O-H is from a hydroxyl group, which would suggest the compound is a diol ester or something else. Hmm, but the ester group itself doesn't have an O-H. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, if the compound is a diester with a hydroxyl group, like a glycol diester, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak isn't from an O-H but from an N-H. But the options don't include nitrogen, so probably not.

Alternatively, maybe the O-H is from a different group, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

The broad peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹ is a strong absorption, so it's probably O-H. So the compound must have an -OH group. So among the options, which have O in the formula and can have an -OH group?

Options A, C, D have O. But B has only one O. So, if the compound has an -OH group, it's likely to have at least two O's. So options A and C have two O's.

Option A has C6H12O2. If it's an acid, then the formula would be C6H12O2. But an acid would have a double bond? Wait, the formula for a six-carbon acid without any double bonds would be C6H12O2. But the NMR shows vinyl H, which suggests a double bond. So that would require one DoU from the double bond and another from the acid's O-H. But wait, the acid has O-H, but the double bond is a DoU, so the total DoU is 2. But for option A, the DoU is (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1 → only one DoU. So that can't be. So option A is unlikely because it can't have both a double bond and an O-H group.

Similarly, option C is C6H10O2. DoU is 2. So it could have a double bond and a carbonyl (the ester's C=O). But where is the O-H? Unless it's an ester with an additional hydroxyl group, which would make it a diol ester. For example, something like HO-R-O-CO-R', but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a diester with an alcohol group. Or perhaps it's a cyclic ester with a double bond and an O-H. Alternatively, maybe the O-H is from a phenol group, but that would require an aromatic ring, which the DoU doesn't support (since for option C, DoU is 2).

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from a ketone, but that doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the mass spec. If the m/z is 45, perhaps it's the molecular ion of a fragment. Let me think about the possible structures.

If the compound is methyl vinyl ketone, which is (CH2=CH)COCH3 (but that's C4H6O), but our options are C6.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is cyclohexene with an ester group. For example, a six-membered ring with a substituent ester group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the compound is an ester with an acetyl group. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. That would have a molecular formula of C6H10O2, which is option C.

In that case, the IR would show C=O at ~1700, and the conjugated double bond might cause a peak around 1650. The O-H would have to come from somewhere. Wait, but in this structure, where is the O-H? Because it's an ester, not an acid, so there's no O-H. So that doesn't fit. So the broad peak at 3000 wouldn't be explained.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the possible structures again.

Wait, maybe the compound is a diol. But that would require more O's. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic hemiacetal or something like that. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the NMR has vinyl H, so the molecule has a double bond. The IR has a carbonyl (maybe ester or ketone) and an O-H (like an alcohol or acid). So perhaps the structure is an allylic alcohol with an ester group.

Wait, for example, something like CH2=CHCH2OOCR, where R is an alkyl group. But that would have O's.

But let me think about the formula. Let's say R is CH3. Then the structure would be CH2=CHCH2OOCCH2CH3. The formula would be C6H10O3, but that's not one of the options. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, maybe it's a mono-ester with an alcohol group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the compound is a beta-keto ester, which has two carbonyl groups. For example, something like CH3COCH2COOCH2CH2CH3. But that's 8 carbons. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclic ester with an alcohol. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diol with an ester group. But that would require more O's. Hmm.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me review the data again.

FTIR: Broad peak at 3000 (O-H), strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 (C=O and maybe conjugated double bond).

1H NMR: Vinyl H's present.

Mass Spec: m/z 45.

So, the presence of O-H suggests either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

If it's a carboxylic acid, then the formula would be RCOOH. So for C6H10O2, that would fit (since a six-carbon acid with a double bond would have C6H10O2).

But the NMR has vinyl H's, which would require a double bond.

Wait, could the compound be something like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH? Let's see: the formula for that would be C6H10O2. So that's option C. Now, does that fit all data?

FTIR: O-H from the acid (broad peak), C=O from the acid at ~1700. The 1650 peak could be from the conjugation between the double bond and the carbonyl, which is common in alpha,beta-unsaturated acids.

1H NMR: The vinyl H's would show up as a triplet or something, depending on the substitution.

Mass Spec: The fragment at 45 could come from somewhere. In the case of hexenoic acid, perhaps a fragment like the acylium ion, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fragment comes from the double bond breaking, but I'm not certain.

So, in this scenario, the compound would be C6H10O2, which is option C.

But wait, earlier I thought that option A was a possibility, but that would require an O-H and a double bond, which might not fit the DoU. Let me check again:

Option A: C6H12O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = 14-12=2 → 1. So one DoU. That would mean either a ring or a double bond.

If the structure is a six-carbon ring (like cyclohexane) with a carboxylic acid group, that would fit the formula. But then, where's the double bond? The NMR shows vinyl H's, so a double bond must be present. So the structure would need to have both a ring and a double bond, which would require two DoU, but option A only allows one. So that's not possible. Therefore, option A is not correct.

So, going back to option C: C6H10O2. DoU is 2. So it can have a double bond and a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond, the O-H would be present, and the double bond would satisfy the vinyl H in NMR. The IR would show the broad O-H at 3000, the C=O at 1700, and the conjugated double bond at 1650. The mass spec fragment at 45 could be from a part of the molecule that includes the acylium ion, but I'm not entirely certain, but it's the best fit among the options.

Wait, another thought: the mass spec m/z 45 could be from the cleavage of the molecule into a smaller fragment. If the compound is a diester or something with a smaller group that breaks off, maybe that's where the 45 comes from.

Alternatively, if the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond, perhaps the ring breaks open to form a fragment. But I'm not sure.

In any case, based on the IR showing O-H and C=O, the NMR showing vinyl H, and the mass spec, the most likely formula is C6H10O2, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry data. The options provided are C₆H₁₂O₂, C₆H₁₀O, C₆H₁₀O₂, and C₆H₁₂O. Here's the analysis:

### FTIR Analysis:
- A broad absorption peak at **3000 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid or alcohol.
- Strong peaks at **1700 cm⁻¹** and **1650 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated double bond.

### ¹H NMR Analysis:
- The presence of peaks corresponding to **vinyl hydrogens** indicates the compound contains a double bond.

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** suggests a smaller fragment, possibly from a functional group like an acylium ion (e.g., CH₃CO⁺).

### Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):
- For **C₆H₁₂O₂**:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 12 - 0)}{2} = 1
  \]  
  This indicates one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring or a double bond. However, the NMR data shows vinyl hydrogens, implying a double bond. This leaves no room for an O-H group, making this option unlikely.
  
- For **C₆H₁₀O**:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 10 - 0)}{2} = 2
  \]  
  This suggests two degrees of unsaturation, which could be a double bond and a ring. However, this formula has only one oxygen atom, which is insufficient to explain the FTIR data (broad O-H and C=O peaks). Thus, this option is not viable.

- For **C₆H₁₀O₂**:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 10 - 0)}{2} = 2
  \]  
  This allows for two degrees of unsaturation, such as a double bond and a carbonyl group. The FTIR data aligns with this, as the broad O-H peak suggests a carboxylic acid, and the C=O peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is consistent with a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR data supports the presence of a double bond, and the mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 could arise from a fragment of the molecule.

- For **C₆H₁₂O**:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 12 - 0)}{2} = 1
  \]  
  This indicates one degree of unsaturation, which could be a double bond or a ring. However, the FTIR data requires an O-H group, and this formula has only one oxygen atom, making it insufficient to explain the broad O-H peak. Thus, this option is unlikely.

### Conclusion:
The most consistent option is **C₆H₁₀O₂**, which accounts for the O-H group, the carbonyl group, the double bond (supported by NMR data), and the mass spectrometry fragment. This formula aligns with all the provided data.

**Answer: C**
