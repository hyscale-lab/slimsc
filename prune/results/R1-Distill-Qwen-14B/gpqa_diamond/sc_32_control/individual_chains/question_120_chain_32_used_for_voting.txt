Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says, if stars are uniformly distributed, how does the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) change with plx? The options are A to D, each with different exponents of 1 over plx.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance, right? So a higher parallax means the star is closer.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. So I think I need to consider how the number of stars depends on the distance or parallax.

If stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density of stars is the same throughout space in all directions. So the number of stars you can see depends on how much volume you can look into. Closer stars would be more numerous in a given area because the volume per unit distance is larger at larger distances.

Wait, no. Wait, let me think. Wait, stars are spread out, so for a given volume, there's a certain number of stars. But when you look at the sky, the number you observe in a certain direction depends on how far you look. So the more distant the stars, the more volume you can include, but each unit volume has the same number of stars.

But the question is about the number per unit parallax. Let me think in terms of differential. Maybe I should model the number of stars in a thin shell at a distance d.

Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. The volume of a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr is 4πd² dr. But since plx is changing with d, maybe we can express everything in terms of plx.

Let me do a substitution. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. The differential dr is the change in distance, which in terms of plx would be dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Oh wait, because d =1/plx, so dr = - (1/plx^2) dplx. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I'm handling the differentials correctly. Maybe we can relate the thickness in parallax terms.

Wait, another approach: the number of stars in a shell with parallax between plx and plx + dplx. So the number of stars would be the number density multiplied by the volume of that shell. Let's say the number density is n (stars per cubic parsec, since distance is in parsecs).

The volume of the shell is 4π d² dr. But d = 1/plx, so d = 1/p, where p is plx. So d = 1/p, so dr = - (1/p²) dp. Wait, because dr is related to the change in p. So if p increases by dp, then d decreases by dr = (1/p²) dp, but since p and dp are positive, and d is inverse, so dr would be negative. But perhaps it's easier to express in terms of p.

So the volume in terms of p is 4π (1/p)^2 * dr. But dr = - (1/p²) dp. So substituting, the volume becomes 4π (1/p²) * (-1/p²) dp. Wait, but that gives a negative volume, which doesn't make sense. Maybe I should take absolute values.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find the volume in terms of p. Let's see: the shell at distance d is a thin sphere. The volume is 4πd² dr. Since dr = (1/p²) dp, because d = 1/p, dr = - (1/p²) dp. So the volume is 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp. Wait, that would be 4π (1/p^4) dp.

But wait, the number of stars in that shell is n (number density) multiplied by the volume. So N = n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So if the shell's number is proportional to (1/p^4) * dp, then the number per unit plx is this divided by dp, which would be (4π n) / p^4.

Wait, but that would give the number of stars per unit plx as proportional to 1/p^4. So the number of stars per unit plx decreases with p^4.

Wait, but that doesn't sound right. Because, for example, if you imagine that for a fixed volume (say, a sphere of radius D), the number of stars should be proportional to D^3 (since volume scales as r^3). But wait, in this case, as parallax decreases (so as distance increases), the number of stars in a thin shell is proportional to 1/p^4. So higher p (closer stars) would have more stars per unit plx.

Wait, but that's the opposite of what I initially thought. Because closer stars (higher plx) are more numerous in a given plx range. Wait, let me think about this.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me double-check.

The shell's volume is 4π d² dr. d is 1/p. So d = 1/p → dr = - (1/p²) dp. So the volume is 4π (1/p)^2 * ( -1/p² ) dp. But when integrating, the negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases, but volume is positive. So perhaps we take absolute value, so the volume becomes 4π (1/p²) (1/p²) dp → 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π (1/p^4) dp. So the number per unit plx (dp) is (4 π n) (1/p^4). So as p increases, the number of stars per unit plx decreases as 1/p^4.

Wait, but that would mean the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/p^4. So the answer would be option A, which is ~ 1/plx^4.

But that doesn't align with my initial intuition. I thought that the number of stars should increase with distance because the volume is larger. Hmm. Wait, but the question is about the change in the number per unit plx. Let me think again. Let's imagine that stars are uniformly distributed, so the number density is the same everywhere. So the number of stars in a volume element is proportional to the volume.

But the thin shell's volume is 4π d² dr. So the number of stars is proportional to d² dr. Since d = 1/p, that's (1/p)^2 dr. So the number per unit dr is (1/p^2) times the number density.

But the question is about per unit plx, which is p. So perhaps I should express dr in terms of dp.

From d = 1/p → dr = - (1/p^2) dp. So dr = -(1/p^2) dp → dr = - (1/p²) dp. So substituting into the number of stars per unit dr: n * (1/p^2) * ( -1/p² dp ) → n * (1/p^4) dp. So per unit p, the number is n * (4 pi) * (1/p^4). So the number of stars per unit p (parallax) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, that would mean that as p increases (so as distance decreases), the number of stars per unit parallax increases. So for a given small range of p, you get more stars when p is higher (closer stars). That seems right because closer stars are more numerous in a given parallax range.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars per unit plx changes with plx. So that the number is proportional to 1/p^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4, which would match.

Wait, but another way to think about it: if I consider all the stars within a certain parallax range, how does the count go? Let's say I have a range of plx from p to p + dp. The number of stars in that range would be the number density times the volume between p and p+dp.

Wait, but maybe I should model it as integrating over all stars with parallax less than p. Then the total number would be proportional to the integral from 0 to p of (number density) * (4 pi d^2 dr). Substituting d=1/p → integral of (n) * (4 pi (1/p)^2) (1/p^2) dp) from 0 to some p.

Wait, wait, no. Let me correct that. The integral would be over all distances d from 0 to D, where D is 1/p. The number of stars is n * ∫ (4 pi d² dr) from 0 to D.

So substituting D=1/p, the integral becomes 4 pi n ∫ d² dr from 0 to 1/p.

Which is 4 pi n [ (1/3) d^3 ] from 0 to 1/p → 4 pi n (1/(3 p^3)) ). So the total number of stars with parallax less than p is proportional to 1/p^3.

So if I have twice the parallax (p becomes 2p), the total number is 1/(2p)^3 → 1/(8 p^3), which is much fewer. So the total number of stars decreases as 1/p^3 as p increases.

But the question is about the number per unit range of plx, which is the differential. So the derivative of the total number with respect to p is the number per unit p. So if the total is T(p) = k / p^3, then dT/dp = -3k / p^4. So the number per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4.

So that supports the conclusion that it's option A.

Wait, but another approach: number per unit volume is n (constant). So the number per unit volume is n. The volume per unit plx is 4 pi (1/p)^2 * (1/p^2) ) → 4 pi / p^4. So the number per unit plx would be n * 4 pi / p^4. So again, 1/p^4.

So the correct answer should be option A: ~1/(plx)^4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( p = 1/d \). The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dr \). Substituting \( d = 1/p \), the volume becomes:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi (1/p)^2 dr = 4\pi (1/p^2) dr.
\]

Since \( d = 1/p \), the differential thickness \( dr \) in terms of \( p \) is \( dr = -(1/p^2) dp \). Substituting this into the volume expression gives:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi (1/p^2) \cdot (1/p^2) dp = 4\pi (1/p^4) dp.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is proportional to the number density \( n \) of stars multiplied by the volume:

\[
\text{Number of stars} = n \cdot 4\pi (1/p^4) dp.
\]

The number of stars per unit range of \( p \) is then:

\[
\text{Number per unit } p = \frac{\text{Number of stars}}{dp} = n \cdot 4\pi (1/p^4).
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( 1/p^4 \), where \( p \) is the parallax. This matches option A.

To confirm, consider the total number of stars with parallax less than \( p \). This is proportional to the integral of the number of stars in shells from \( 0 \) to \( p \), which gives a total number proportional to \( 1/p^3 \). The derivative of this total number with respect to \( p \) yields the number per unit \( p \), which is proportional to \( 1/p^4 \). This reinforces the conclusion that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( 1/p^4 \).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
