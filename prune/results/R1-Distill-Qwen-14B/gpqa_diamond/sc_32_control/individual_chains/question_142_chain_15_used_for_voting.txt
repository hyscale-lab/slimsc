Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located in qubit space. Hmm. Let me remember what I know about density matrices.

So the given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I think this is a diagonal matrix because |0> and |1> are orthogonal. Let me write it out in matrix form to visualize.

The standard basis for a qubit is |0> = [1, 0]^T and |1> = [0, 1]^T. So |0><0| would be a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is 1 in (2,2) and zeros elsewhere. Adding these together and multiplying by 1/2, the density matrix becomes:

ρ = (1/2) * [ [1, 0],
               [0, 1] ]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, because each of |0><0| and |1><1| has diagonal entries 1, so adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], and then 1/2 of that would be [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So ρ is a 2x2 matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position of this state in qubit space. I'm a bit confused about what that means, but I remember that density matrices can represent states in a higher-dimensional space, perhaps the Bloch sphere.

Wait, right! The Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. For a pure state |ψ>, the density matrix is |ψ><ψ|, and it's located on the surface of the Bloch sphere. But when the state is a mixed state, like this one, it's represented inside the sphere.

Wait, so the density matrix ρ is a mixed state here. Because if it were pure, the density matrix would have trace one and satisfy ρ^2 = ρ. Let me check: the trace of ρ is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1, which is correct for a density matrix. Now, ρ squared would be (1/2)^2 multiplied by (|0><0| + |1><1|)^2, since each term is squared and cross terms would involve |0><1| and |1><0|, which are zero when multiplied by |0> or |1>. Wait, actually, |0><0| squared is |0><0|, same with |1><1|. So ρ squared is (1/4)(|0><0| + |1><1|) + cross terms? Or wait, when you square the sum, you get each term squared plus twice the sum of the cross terms. But in this case, the cross terms are |0><0| * |1><1|, which when multiplied would be |0><1|, which is zero when multiplied with |0> or |1>. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute ρ^2. So ρ is 0.5 I, where I is the identity matrix. So ρ squared would be (0.5)^2 I = 0.25 I. But ρ is 0.5 I. So ρ^2 = 0.25 I, which is not equal to ρ. Therefore, ρ is not a pure state, which makes sense because it's a mixed state of |0> and |1>, each with equal probability.

So the state is a completely mixed state. I think the completely mixed state in 2x2 dimensions is represented as (I)/2, which is exactly what ρ is. So ρ is (I)/2, which is the maximally mixed state.

Now, how is this represented in the Bloch sphere? I remember that any density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (the Bloch vector) with components (x, y, z). For a pure state, the Bloch vector lies on the surface of the unit sphere. For a completely mixed state, the Bloch vector is at the origin.

Wait, let me think again. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. If r is zero, ρ is I/2, which is the maximally mixed state. So in this case, since ρ is I/2, the Bloch vector r must be (0, 0, 0), because all the Pauli terms (x, y, z) are zero.

So the geometrical position is the origin in the Bloch sphere. Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). That must be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check. What's the Bloch vector for this state? The density matrix is diagonal with both diagonal elements 0.5. So in the Bloch vector terms, which are x, y, z components, each corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. So for ρ = diag(0.5, 0.5), the expectation value of σ_x is Tr(ρ σ_x). Since σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], the product ρ σ_x is 0.5 [[0,1],[1,0]], so the trace is 0. Similarly for σ_y and σ_z. Wait, no: σ_z is diagonal with entries 1 and -1, so Tr(ρ σ_z) is 0.5*(1) + 0.5*(-1) )= 0.5*(0) )=0. So all components of r are zero. So r is (0,0,0), which is option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

In matrix form, this is:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix}
0.5 & 0 \\
0 & 0.5
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is a diagonal matrix with equal probabilities (0.5) for the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), indicating a maximally mixed state. A mixed state is represented inside the Bloch sphere, and its position is determined by the Bloch vector \(r = (x, y, z)\), where \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) are the expectation values of the Pauli matrices \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\), respectively.

For the given density matrix, the expectation values are calculated as follows:

1. \(\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_x)\): Since \(\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\), the product \(\rho \sigma_x\) is \(\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0.5 \\ 0.5 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\), and the trace is 0. Thus, \(x = 0\).
2. \(\langle \sigma_y \rangle = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_y)\): Similarly, \(\sigma_y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}\), and the product \(\rho \sigma_y\) is \(\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -0.5i \\ 0.5i & 0 \end{bmatrix}\), with a trace of 0. Thus, \(y = 0\).
3. \(\langle \sigma_z \rangle = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_z)\): \(\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\), and the product \(\rho \sigma_z\) is \(\begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & 0 \\ 0 & -0.5 \end{bmatrix}\), with a trace of 0. Thus, \(z = 0\).

Since all components of the Bloch vector \(r = (x, y, z)\) are zero, the density matrix corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere. This is consistent with the fact that the state is maximally mixed, as the maximally mixed state is represented at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the correct answer is:
