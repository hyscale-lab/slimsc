Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. I'm a bit rusty, but let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh right, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the spin-z operator. So, the first thing I should do is probably normalize this state because probabilities require it to have a magnitude of 1.

Wait, but the question says it's proportional, which means we need to compute the normalization factor. So, let's find the normalization constant. The state is |alpha> = a*(1+i)|up> + a*(2-i)|down>. The constant 'a' is what we'll determine. But wait, no, actually, the state is given as proportional, so it's (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, but we have to normalize it.

So the normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. Let's compute that. The inner product would be the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each component. So the first term is (1+i), its magnitude squared is (1^2 +1^2)=2. The second term is (2-i), magnitude squared is (2^2 + (-1)^2)=4+1=5. So total is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, but wait—actually, the state is written as proportional to that, so the actual state is [ (1+i) |up> + (2-i)|down> ] multiplied by 1/sqrt(7). So, yes, that's right.

Now, the question is about the operator whose matrix representation A has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i != j, else 0. So, the matrix is 2x2, since the spin is up and down, which forms a two-level system. So, A is a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements (A_11 and A_22) are zero, and the off-diagonal elements (A_12 and A_21) are hbar/2 each.

Wait, let me write that out. So, in terms of matrices, A would look like:
[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

Is that right? Because for i != j, A_ij = hbar/2. So yeah, that's correct.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin matrices are usually represented with different signs. Oh wait, but this operator is given, so I should just go with that.

The problem asks for the probability of measuring each eigenstate of this operator A. Wait, no, wait. The operator's eigenstates are the possible measurement outcomes. So, the probabilities are the square of the absolute values of the components when the state is expressed as a linear combination of the eigenstates of A.

Wait, but how do I find the eigenstates of A? Because the operator's matrix is given, so I can find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Let me think. The matrix A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) =0.

So, determinant of [ -λ, hbar/2 ] is (-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)^2 = λ^2 - (hbar^2)/4 =0. So λ^2 = (hbar^2)/4 => λ= ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are λ_+ = hbar/2 and λ_- = -hbar/2. Now, the corresponding eigenvectors.

For λ= hbar/2, the equation (A - (hbar/2) I ) |v> =0.

So matrix becomes:
[ -hbar/2, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]

The equations are: (-hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v2 =v1.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to (1,1). Similarly, for λ= -hbar/2:

Matrix becomes:
[ hbar/2, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, hbar/2 ]

Equations: (hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0 → v1 +v2=0 → v2= -v1.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to (1, -1).

But since we can choose any normalization, we can represent the eigenvectors as |e+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |e-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Wait, or is it the other way around? No, wait. Because for λ= hbar/2, the eigenvector is (1,1), which would be (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), but let me check. Let me express |up> as (1,0) and |down> as (0,1). So the eigenvectors for λ= hbar/2 are [1;1], which is |up> + |down>, and for λ= -hbar/2, it's [1; -1], which is |up> - |down>.

So the eigenstates are |e+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |e-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me make sure. When I write |e+>, I think the eigenvalue is +hbar/2. So yes, when I apply A to |e+>, I get (hbar/2)|e+>, right? Let me check:

A|e+> = (1/sqrt(2)) [A|up> + A|down> ]

What's A|up>? From the matrix, A acting on |up> (which is [1,0]^T) would be [0*1 + (hbar/2)*0, (hbar/2)*1 + 0*0 ]^T. Wait, no, matrix multiplication is:

A|up> = [0 *1 + (hbar/2)*0; (hbar/2)*1 + 0*0 ] = [0; hbar/2 *1 ].

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the matrix. The matrix A is:

Row 1: 0, hbar/2

Row 2: hbar/2, 0

So A|up> = [ (0*1)+(hbar/2 *0) , (hbar/2 *1) + (0 *0) ]^T? Wait, no. Wait, no, for a 2x2 matrix and a column vector [a; b], the product is [0*a + (hbar/2)*b, (hbar/2)*a + 0*b]^T.

So A|up> = [ (hbar/2)*0, (hbar/2)*1 ] = [0; hbar/2].

Similarly, A|down> = [ (hbar/2)*1, 0 ] = [hbar/2; 0].

Wait, no, wait: |down> is [0;1], so A|down> would be [ (hbar/2)*1, 0*1 ] = [hbar/2; 0].

So when you act A on |e+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), which is (1/sqrt(2)) [1;1], so:

A |e+> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ A|up> + A|down> ]

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ [0; hbar/2 ] + [ hbar/2; 0 ] ] = (1/sqrt(2)) [ hbar/2; hbar/2 ].

Which equals (1/sqrt(2)) (hbar/2) [1;1] = (hbar/2) |e+>.

So yes, that works. Similarly, for |e->, which is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2):

A|e-> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ A|up> - A|down> ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ [0; hbar/2] - [hbar/2; 0] ] = (1/sqrt(2)) [ -hbar/2; hbar/2 ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) (hbar/2) [ -1; 1 ] = (hbar/2) ( -1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2) ), which is the same as (hbar/2) |e->.

Wait, no, because [ -1;1 ] is the same as (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) multiplied by -1. Wait, no, because |e-> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So [ -1;1 ] is ( -|up> + |down> )/sqrt(2) = - |e->. So A|e-> = (hbar/2)( - |e-> ) = (- hbar/2 ) |e->. So the eigenvalues are as I found before, ± hbar/2.

So the operator A has eigenstates |e+> and |e->, corresponding to eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2, respectively.

Now, the state |alpha> is expressed in the |up> and |down> basis, but we need to express it in terms of the eigenstates |e+> and |e->, because the probabilities are the squares of the coefficients in that expansion.

So, let's find the expansion of |alpha> in the |e+>, |e-> basis.

Given that |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

We can write |alpha> = c_+ |e+> + c_- |e->.

To find c_+ and c_-, we can express |alpha> in terms of |e+> and |e->.

Since |e+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |e-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), we can solve for |up> and |down> in terms of |e+> and |e->.

Let me write:
|up> = (|e+> + |e->)/sqrt(2)
|down> = (|e+> - |e->)/sqrt(2)

So substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) * [ (|e+> + |e->)/sqrt(2) ) ] + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * [ (|e+> - |e->)/sqrt(2) )

Let's factor out 1/sqrt(2):

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * ( |e+> + |e-> ) + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * ( |e+> - |e-> ) ] / sqrt(2)

Let me distribute the terms:

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |e+> + (1+i)/sqrt(7) |e-> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |e+> - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |e-> ] / sqrt(2)

Now group the |e+> and |e-> terms:

|e+> [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] + |e-> [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] ) all divided by sqrt(2)

So, the coefficients for |e+> and |e-> are:

c_+ = [ (1+i + 2 - i ) / sqrt(7) ] / sqrt(2)
= [ (3)/sqrt(7) ] / sqrt(2)
= 3 / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2))
= 3 / sqrt(14)

Similarly, c_- = [ (1+i - (2 - i) ) / sqrt(7) ] / sqrt(2)
= [ (1 + i -2 +i ) / sqrt(7) ] / sqrt(2)
= [ (-1 + 2i ) / sqrt(7) ] / sqrt(2)
= (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)

Wait, let me recalculate c_+. Let me compute (1+i) + (2 - i) = 3 +0i =3. So numerator is 3. So c_+ is 3/(sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)).

Similarly for c_-, compute (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) ) = (-1) + 2i. So numerator is (-1 + 2i), so c_- is (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)).

Wait, but wait, in the expression, I think I missed the division by sqrt(2). Because after grouping, each term is divided by sqrt(2), right? So the overall expression is [ ... ] divided by sqrt(2) outside, so each coefficient inside is ( ... ) / sqrt(7) divided by sqrt(2), which is ( ... ) / sqrt(14).

Wait, no, let me re-express:

When I group the terms, each |e+> and |e-> has a coefficient that's (something)/sqrt(7) divided by sqrt(2), because the entire expression is divided by sqrt(2). So for c_+:

c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / ( sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) ) )
= (3) / ( sqrt(14) )
= 3 / sqrt(14)

Similarly, c_- = [ (1+i ) - (2 -i) ] / ( sqrt(7)*sqrt(2) )
= ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14 )

Now, the probabilities for each eigenstate are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2: (3)^2 / ( sqrt(14) )^2 = 9 /14 ≈ 0.642857. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but let me compute exactly: 9/14 ≈0.642857. So about 0.64, which matches option A's first value.

Now compute |c_-|^2: (-1 + 2i) is a complex number. The magnitude is sqrt( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 )= sqrt(1 +4)=sqrt(5). So |c_-|^2 is (sqrt(5))^2 / (14) =5/14 ≈0.3571.

Wait, but 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is close to 0.36. So the probabilities would be 9/14 ≈0.643 and 5/14≈0.357.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which fits these. The sum is 14/14=1, so that's correct.

Now, the average value of the operator A. The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

But wait, another way: the expectation value is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities.

Since the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2, and the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, respectively.

So the average value is (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) ) = [ (9 -5) hbar ]/(28) ) = (4 hbar)/(28) )= hbar/(7).

So the average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A says average is hbar/7. So the first part of option A gives 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7. So that matches.

But wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute <A> directly using the original state.

Wait, another approach: since A is given, perhaps calculating <A> is easier.

The state |alpha> is ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So <alpha| is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

The operator A in the |up>, |down> basis is:

[ [0, hbar/2],
  [hbar/2, 0] ]

So <A> = <alpha| A |alpha> = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7); (2-i)/sqrt(7) ].

Let me compute this matrix product.

Compute A |alpha> first.

A |alpha> = [0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (hbar/2)*(2-i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (hbar/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2-i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

So the first component is (hbar/2) (2 -i)/sqrt(7) = hbar (2 -i)/(2 sqrt(7)).

The second component is (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) = hbar (1+i)/(2 sqrt(7)).

So A |alpha> = [ hbar (2 -i)/(2 sqrt(7)), hbar (1+i)/(2 sqrt(7)) ].

Now, <alpha| A |alpha> is the inner product of <alpha| and A |alpha>:

= (1-i)/sqrt(7) * [ hbar (2 -i) ]/(2 sqrt(7)) ) + (2 + i)/sqrt(7) * [ hbar (1 +i) ]/(2 sqrt(7)) )

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: (1-i)(2 -i) * hbar/(2 *7 )

Multiply (1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) -i*2 + i^2*(-1) → 2 -i -2i + (-1) = (2-1) + (-3i) )= 1 -3i.

Wait, let me compute:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i) = 2 -i -2i +i^2. Since i^2=-1, so 2 -3i -1 =1 -3i.

So the first term is (1 -3i) hbar/(2*7) = (1 -3i) hbar/(14).

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) * hbar/(2 *7 )

Multiply (2+i)(1+i) = 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i = 2 +2i +i +i^2 = 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

So the second term is (1 +3i) hbar/(14).

Adding both terms:

(1 -3i +1 +3i ) hbar/(14) ) = (2) hbar/(14) )= hbar/(7).

So the average value is hbar/7, which matches what I found earlier using the eigenvalues and probabilities.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357, which are 9/14 and 5/14. Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36 and average hbar/7. So option A is correct.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. Option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6429, which is about 0.64, and 5/14≈0.357, which is ~0.36. So option A matches.

But wait, the question in the options says the probabilities are for each eigenstate, which are two, and the average.

So the correct answer would be option A.

To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by computing the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:

\[
|1+i|^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 5, \quad \text{so the total is } 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \), which gives \( \lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The corresponding eigenvectors are:

\[
|e_+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |e_-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |e_+\rangle \) and \( |e_-\rangle \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of these eigenstates. Using the relations:

\[
|\uparrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|e_+\rangle + |e_-\rangle), \quad |\downarrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|e_+\rangle - |e_-\rangle),
\]

we substitute into \( |\alpha\rangle \):

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|e_+\rangle + |e_-\rangle) + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|e_+\rangle - |e_-\rangle).
\]

Grouping terms, the coefficients for \( |e_+\rangle \) and \( |e_-\rangle \) are:

\[
c_+ = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{14}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_- = \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{14}} = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
|c_+|^2 = \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad |c_-|^2 = \left(\frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), matching the first two values in option A.

To compute the average value of \( A \), we use the fact that the expectation value is the weighted sum of the eigenvalues, with weights as the probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{4\hbar}{28} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

This matches the average value given in option A. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
