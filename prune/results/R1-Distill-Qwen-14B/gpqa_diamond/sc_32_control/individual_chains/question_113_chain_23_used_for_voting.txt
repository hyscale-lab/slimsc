Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about identifying a compound based on its spectral data. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through this step by step.

The question gives me the options for the chemical formula, which are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. My job is to figure out which one is correct using the data provided.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The absorption peaks are at 3000 (very broad), 1700, and 1650 cm^-1. I remember that a broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 is usually due to O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H peak. If it's an alcohol, the O-H stretch is usually broader but maybe not as strong. Alternatively, if it's an ether or something else without O-H, that peak wouldn't be there. So the presence of this peak suggests the compound has an -OH group.

The peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1 are in the carbonyl region. The 1700 is probably a carbonyl, maybe a ketone or aldehyde or ester or something. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, perhaps conjugated, like an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group. Wait, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in an aromatic ester or something like that. Alternatively, 1650 could be an amide I band, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not that. So perhaps one carbonyl is a ketone (around 1700) and another might be an ester or maybe a conjugated carbonyl.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR. It says there are several peaks, including some for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the molecule has a double bond, maybe a substituted vinyl group. Also, the presence of these peaks suggests perhaps an aromatic ring, but not necessarily. Or maybe an isolated double bond.

Then, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. I'm trying to think what fragment would give that. A m/z of 45 could correspond to several things. Let me think: 45 is the molecular weight of some common fragments. For example, the (CH3)2CO+ would be 58? No, wait. Let me think: CH3CO+ is 43? Or wait, maybe it's a (CH2) group. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, considering the molecular formulas, if the compound is C6H10O2, for example, what fragments could come off?

Alternatively, 45 could be the molecular ion of a smaller molecule, like maybe CH3CH2OH (ethanol) has a molecular weight of 46, but that's not 45. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of something like CH3COOCH3? No, wait. Let me compute the possible molecular weights. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment like CH2CH2O, but that doesn't make sense. Let's think: 45 could be (CH2O) which is formaldehyde, but that's 30. Hmm. Or maybe it's a tropylium ion, but that's usually heavier. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a (CH2)2CO+ ion, but wait, 45 would be (CH2)2CO+ would have a mass of 12*3 + 1*4 + 16 = 36 + 4 +16=56? No, that's too high.

Wait, maybe the fragment is something like (CH3)2CO+ (acetone) which has a molecular weight of 58? No, that's higher than 45. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene group attached to something else. I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should consider other data points first.

Looking back at the formula options:

A) C6H12O2: degrees of unsaturation. Let's calculate. Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since X and N are 0, DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU. But wait, if the compound is C6H12O2, that's a DoU of 1. So that could mean a ring, a double bond, or a carbonyl group.

B) C6H10O: DoU is (2*6 +2 -10)/2=(14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. Could be two double bonds, or a double bond and a ring, or one double bond and two rings, etc.

C) C6H10O2: DoU=(14-10)/2=2. So same as B, two DoU.

D) C6H12O: DoU= (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU.

Now, the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000 (O-H), and two carbonyl peaks. So the compound has two carbonyl groups? Or perhaps an O-H and a carbonyl.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The FTIR has peaks at 1700 and 1650. 1700 is typically a carbonyl, maybe a ketone (around 1715 for aldehydes, 1680-1720 for ketones, esters, etc.), and 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group, but another possibility is an enol ether or something else. Alternatively, 1650 could be an aromatic ring's C=C stretch, but that's usually around 1600, so maybe not. So perhaps two carbonyl groups in the molecule?

Wait, let me think about the possible functional groups. If the compound has an ester group, that would give a carbonyl around 1700-1750. An ester group also has an O-H from the alcohol part? No, because esters are R-O-C-O-R, so no O-H. Wait, but the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which would suggest an O-H. So if the molecule has an ester group and maybe a hydroxyl group, that could explain the two O's.

Wait, but let me think about the possible formulas. Let's see:

If the formula is C6H10O2, that would fit two oxygen-containing functional groups, like an ester and a hydroxyl, or two esters, but more likely an ester and a hydroxyl because of the O-H peak.

Alternatively, maybe a ketone and a hydroxyl group. But a ketone would have a carbonyl peak around 1700, and another functional group would account for the other peak.

Wait, but in the options, the formulas are as follows:

A) C6H12O2: two oxygen atoms, possible ester and an alcohol? Or maybe a carboxylic acid and something else. But let's think about the molecular formula.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the possible structure. The presence of vinyl hydrogens (from NMR) suggests a double bond. So the molecule has a double bond, so that's a DoU. The two carbonyl peaks might suggest two carbonyl groups, which would be two DoU. So the total DoU would be 3: but wait, let me think again.

Wait, the DoU for each formula:

Option A: C6H12O2: DoU=1.

Option B: C6H10O: DoU=2.

Option C: C6H10O2: DoU=2.

Option D: C6H12O: DoU=1.

So if the compound has a double bond (DoU 1), and two carbonyl groups (each DoU 1), that would require a total of 3 DoU. But none of the options have that. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a conjugated system, like an aromatic ring with double bonds, which counts as one DoU for each ring and each double bond.

Wait, if the molecule has an aromatic ring (which is a DoU of 4 for benzene, but maybe in a substituted benzene, but perhaps the molecule is not fully aromatic but has a conjugated diene or something.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the carbonyl groups is part of an ester, and the other is an alcohol's O-H.

Wait, perhaps the peaks at 1700 and 1650 are from an ester and a conjugated carbonyl. Hmm.

But considering the NMR, which includes vinyl hydrogens, that's a double bond elsewhere in the molecule. So let's think about possible structures.

Wait, maybe the compound is a diester, like something with two ester groups. But the O-H peak would suggest an alcohol or another -OH group, which diesters don't have. So perhaps it's a mono-ester with an alcohol group elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone. But then, would that have a broad O-H peak? Lactones don't have free -OH groups, but perhaps an enol form? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an aromatic ester with a substituent that has a double bond, leading to vinyl protons in the NMR.

Wait, but let's go back to the mass spec. The fragment at m/z=45. What is that? Let's think about possible fragments. 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CO (acetone is (CH3)2CO, which is 58, no... Wait, wait. Let me compute the possible fragments.

Wait, 45 could be C3H7O+? But that's not a common fragment. Alternatively, 45 is (CH2O)+, which is formaldehyde? No, that's 30. Hmm.

Wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. Let me think about possible molecules with that mass. For example, (CH3)2CHO+ would be 58 (C3H7O). Wait, not helpful. Alternatively, maybe CH2=CH-O- something? Not sure. Or perhaps a fragment where a part of the molecule breaks off.

Wait, another approach: think about the degree of unsaturation. The DoU for the correct formula needs to account for the presence of two carbonyl groups (assuming two peaks at 1700 and 1650 are two carbonyl groups) and a double bond (from the vinyl H's).

If the molecule has a double bond (DoU 1), and two carbonyl groups (each DoU 1), that's 3 DoU. But none of the formulas have that. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe one of the carbonyl peaks is not a carbonyl. Another possibility is that the 1650 cm^-1 peak is from a conjugated double bond (like in an aromatic ring). For example, a benzene ring with a substituent that has a carbonyl.

So if the 1700 is a carbonyl (like an ester or ketone), and the 1650 is from a conjugated double bond (like an aromatic ring), then that would account for the peaks without requiring two carbonyls.

In that case, the molecule would have a benzene ring (DoU 4, but that's if it's a benzene ring, but maybe it's a substituted ring), a carbonyl group (DoU 1), and a double bond (vinyl H, DoU1). Wait, but that would be 4 + 1 +1 =6 DoU, but that can't be right because the molecular formulas don't have that many.

Hmm, perhaps the 1650 is an aromatic ring. So the molecule has an aromatic ring (DoU 4?), but that would require a higher number of degrees of unsaturation than any of the options provide.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: think about possible structures that fit the given data.

The FTIR shows a broad O-H peak, so likely either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But since the other peaks are around 1700 and 1650, which are carbonyls, perhaps it's an ester and an alcohol.

Wait, let's consider a structure like methyl salicylate. That has an ester group (which would show a peak around 1700) and a hydroxyl group (the phenolic O-H, which is usually broader but could fit the description). The aromatic ring would show peaks around 1500-1600, but in the FTIR given, the peaks are at 1700 and 1650. Alternatively, maybe another structure.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an aromatic ketone with an alcohol group, but that's stretching it.

Wait, but let's try to think of the options. The options are:

A) C6H12O2: possible formula for, say, an ester with an alcohol group. For example, methyl cyclohexanoate would have a formula C7H10O2, which is larger than this, so maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps a diol with an ester? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: let's consider the possible molecular formulas and their possible structures.

Option C is C6H10O2. The molecular weight would be 6*12 +10 +32=72+10+32=114 g/mol.

DoU is (2*6 +2 -10)/2=2. So two degrees. So the possible structures could be a ring plus a double bond, or two double bonds, or a ring and a carbonyl.

Wait, if the structure has a benzene ring (which would account for 4 DoU), but that's more than allowed, so perhaps not.

Alternatively, if it's a cyclopentene ring with a carbonyl group (ester), that would contribute 3 DoU: the ring (1), the double bond (1), and the carbonyl (1). But that's three, while the DoU is 2, so that can't be.

Wait, maybe a cyclic ester, like a lactone. That would have a ring (1 DoU) and a carbonyl (another DoU), so total of 2, which fits C6H10O2.

If it's a cyclic ester, like a gamma-lactone or delta-lactone, but for C6H10O2, perhaps it's a six-membered ring. So for example, a cyclic ester derived from a diol, maybe forming a six-membered ring with an ester linkage. That would have a structure like (CH2)4O-CO-O, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diester, but then the formula would have more O's. Wait, no, O's are in the formula.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let's try to think about the mass spec. The m/z=45 is a significant fragment. Let's compute the possible fragments.

If the molecular ion is, say, 114 (for C6H10O2), then a fragment losing 69 would leave 45? 114-69=45. So what would lose 69? 69 is the molecular weight of something like (CH2)2CO (58?), but wait, 69 is more like (CH3)2CH2COOH? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule breaks into a smaller fragment. For example, if the molecule is something like propenoate ester. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is (CH2)COOH, which is 59? Wait, not 45.

Wait, what's the molecular weight of CH3COOCH2CH2CH2CH3? That's ethyl propionate, which is 136 g/mol. If the parent is larger, but let me think about the possible fragment. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if the fragment at m/z=45 is the (CH3)2O+ ion, which is 45 (since (CH3)2O is 45). So that would imply that the molecule loses a (CH3)2O group. But that would require the molecule to have a (CH3)2O group attached. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH2CH2O+ group, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is (CH2)2O+, which would be 44 (12*2 + 1*4 +16=24+4+16=44), but that's not 45. Close, but not quite.

Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3)CO+, which would be 43 (12+3*1 +12+16= 12+3=15; 12+16=28; 15+28=43). So 43. But the fragment is at 45, so that's not it.

Hmm, I'm not getting anywhere with this. Let's try to think of the possible formulas and which would fit the data.

The FTIR has O-H (so O in the formula), two carbonyls, and a double bond (vinyl H). So the compound has a hydroxyl group, two carbonyls, and a double bond.

Wait, but the options don't have any formula with three oxygen atoms, so that's not possible. So perhaps two of the functional groups are accounted for with two oxygen atoms.

Wait, so if the structure has an ester (O from the ester group) and an alcohol (another O), that would fit C6H12O2, which is option A.

Alternatively, the structure could have a ketone and an ester. But each of those would require oxygen.

Wait, let me think about each option's possible structure.

Option A: C6H12O2.

Possible structures: ester and alcohol, perhaps. For example, something like methyl cyclopentanoate. Wait, cyclopentanoate would have a five-membered ring. Or maybe it's a substituted ester with an alcohol group.

But wait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. So the structure must have a double bond as well. So maybe a cyclic ester with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, but if the formula is C6H12O2, the degrees of unsaturation is 1. So one double bond or ring. But the presence of a double bond (vinyl H) and a carbonyl (DoU of 1 each) would require two DoU, which is not possible for this formula.

Hmm, that's a problem. So if the formula is C6H12O2, the degrees of unsaturation is 1, but the presence of two carbonyl groups would require two DoU, which is not possible. So that suggests that this formula is not the correct one.

Wait, perhaps one of the carbonyl groups is part of an ester and the other is something else, but I'm not seeing it.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation is 2.

So for this formula, two DoU can be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

If the structure has a ring (DoU 1), a carbonyl (DoU 1), and a double bond (DoU 1), that would require three DoU, which this formula doesn't have. So that's a problem.

Wait, maybe the two carbonyls are part of a single functional group, like an ester. So one carbonyl. But then there's another peak at 1650, which would have to be something else.

Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, but that's still a single carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group. For example, an aromatic ester. Let's say, something like methyl benzoate. But wait, benzoate is C6H5COOCH3, which has a molecular formula C8H8O2. That's not matching any of the options here.

Wait, perhaps it's a substituted benzoic acid ester. But that doesn't fit either.

Alternatively, maybe it's a six-membered ring with an ester and a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so perhaps the structure has a double bond adjacent to an electronegative atom, making the vinyl protons deshielded. Or perhaps it's a trans double bond.

But I'm not making progress. Let's try looking at each option again.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU 1. So possible structures: either a ring (like cyclohexane) with an ester group, or a double bond and an ester.

But to have two carbonyl peaks, that would require two carbonyl groups, which would require two DoU. So this can't be the case.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU 2. Possible structures: a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. For example, 1,3-diene with a ring.

But the FTIR shows O-H, so it's an alcohol. So maybe a cyclohexene ring with an OH group. But then, where are the carbonyl peaks? This option only has one O, so it can't have an ester or another carbonyl group. So the two carbonyl peaks in FTIR would not fit. So option B is probably not the correct one.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU 2. So two DoU. It can have a ring and a carbonyl group, or two double bonds and a carbonyl, but wait, two DoU would allow for a ring plus a carbonyl, or two double bonds.

Wait, if the structure has an ester group (one carbonyl, one DoU) and a double bond (another DoU), that's two DoU. So that fits. So that would give the two carbonyl peaks? Wait, the FTIR has two peaks, but the ester would have one carbonyl. So where is the other peak coming from?

Hmm, perhaps the other carbonyl is from another group, like a ketone, but then the formula would have more oxygen. Or perhaps the other peak is from something else, like an aromatic ring.

Wait, but if the structure is a diester, that would have two carbonyl groups. But the formula is C6H10O2, which would require two ester groups. For example, diethyl succinate would have more carbons, but maybe a cyclic diester.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an aromatic ester with a substituent that has a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU 1. So either a ring or a double bond. No, because the FTIR has two carbonyl peaks, which would require two DoU. So this formula is unlikely.

So, based on the DoU, only options A, C, and D have O's, but they don't fit the two carbonyls.

Wait, maybe the 1650 cm^-1 is not a carbonyl but an aromatic ring's C=C. So perhaps the structure has a benzene ring (which would have C=C peaks around 1600), but the 1650 is a bit higher, so maybe it's an unsaturated carbonyl, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

For example, an enone structure. So, the 1700 is the carbonyl, and the 1650 is the conjugated double bond. So that would account for two peaks in the IR.

So if the structure has an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group, that would explain the two IR peaks. Then, the O-H is from an alcohol group.

So, the structure would have a conjugated carbonyl and a double bond, and an O-H group.

Now, considering the molecular formulas.

If the structure is something like cyclohexenone with an alcohol substituent, but that's probably C6H10O2, which is option C.

Wait, cyclohexenone would be C6H10O. But if it has an additional O from an alcohol group, that would make it C6H12O2? No, wait. Let me compute.

Wait, cyclohexenone is C6H10O (DoU 2: ring and carbonyl). If it has an additional -OH group, the formula becomes C6H10O2. So option C.

Now, the NMR has vinyl H's, which would be the double bond in the cyclohexenone. So that fits.

The IR would show O-H (broad at 3000), the carbonyl at 1700, and the conjugated double bond at 1650.

The mass spec fragment at 45: perhaps a fragment from the ring breaking.

But I'm not certain about the mass spec part. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the ester part. Wait, if it's an ester, maybe the fragment is from the ester group.

But I'm not exactly sure about that. However, considering the other spectral data, option C seems plausible.

So putting it all together:

- FTIR: O-H (broad), two carbonyls (1700 and 1650).
- 1H NMR: vinyl H's, so a double bond.
- Mass spec: fragment at 45 could be a part of the structure.

The formula that fits is C6H10O2, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectral data: FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The options are C₆H₁₂O₂, C₆H₁₀O, C₆H₁₀O₂, and C₆H₁₂O. Here's the analysis:

### FTIR Analysis
- A broad absorption peak at **3000 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
- Peaks at **1700 cm⁻¹** and **1650 cm⁻¹** are in the carbonyl region. The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak suggests a carbonyl group (e.g., ester, ketone), while the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak could correspond to a conjugated carbonyl or a double bond.

### ¹H NMR Analysis
- The presence of peaks corresponding to **vinyl hydrogens** indicates a double bond in the structure.

### Mass Spectrometry Analysis
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** is significant. This could correspond to a common fragment, such as (CH₃)₂O⁺ (45 g/mol).

### Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU)
The degrees of unsaturation for each formula are calculated as:
- **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 1
- **B) C₆H₁₀O**: DoU = 2
- **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**: DoU = 2
- **D) C₆H₁₂O**: DoU = 1

### Key Observations and Elimination
1. **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂)**: DoU = 1. This formula cannot account for the two carbonyl peaks observed in the FTIR spectrum, as two carbonyl groups would require two DoU. Thus, this option is eliminated.
2. **Option B (C₆H₁₀O)**: DoU = 2. This formula has only one oxygen atom, which cannot explain the two carbonyl peaks in the FTIR spectrum. Thus, this option is eliminated.
3. **Option D (C₆H₁₂O)**: DoU = 1. Similar to Option A, this formula cannot account for the two carbonyl peaks observed in the FTIR spectrum. Thus, this option is eliminated.
4. **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**: DoU = 2. This formula can account for the two carbonyl peaks (one from an ester or ketone and another from a conjugated system) and the O-H group. The presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR spectrum aligns with a double bond, and the DoU matches the structural requirements.

### Conclusion
The spectral data, including the FTIR peaks, ¹H NMR signals, and mass spectrometry fragment, are consistent with **C₆H₁₀O₂**. This formula satisfies the degrees of unsaturation and explains the observed functional groups.

**Answer: C**
