Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with various distances in meters.

Wait, what do I remember about decay lengths? Oh right, the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. But how exactly?

I think the formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime gamma factor and the velocity. Oh, right! The mean decay distance L is given by L = gamma * v * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, and v is the velocity of the particle.

But wait, how do I find the lifetime tau? Tau is related to the width Γ. Oh, right, the uncertainty principle! The width Γ is related to the mean lifetime by tau = ℏ / Γ. Or wait, no, the full width Γ is related to the lifetime via the uncertainty principle. The product of the width and the lifetime should be on the order of Planck's constant over 2π. So tau ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, more accurately, the mean lifetime tau is equal to ħ divided by the width Γ. Because the width is the inverse of the lifetime in natural units. So tau = ħ / Γ.

So putting it together: L = gamma * v * (ħ / Γ). But wait, let's think in terms of units and how to compute this.

But wait, the particle is a meson, so it's a boson, but for the decay distance, the formula should still apply. Okay.

So, let's break down the steps:

1. Calculate the lifetime tau = ħ / Γ.

But wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in units that include GeV·s or something. So I think I need to convert the units properly.

Wait, the reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because ħ ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, but when using GeV, it's about 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Let me confirm: yes, ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma Γ is given as 320 MeV. Wait, I need to convert Γ into GeV to match the units of ħ. So 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s.

Calculating that: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So tau ≈ 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 6.582 /0.32: 0.32 × 20 =6.4, 0.32 ×20.5 =6.56, so 20.5 is 6.56. 6.582 is 0.022 over 6.56, so 0.022/(0.32) = ~0.06875. So 20.5 + 0.06875=20.56875.

Yes, so tau ≈ 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

2. Now, compute the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is E / (m c²). But wait, E is given as 8 GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = E / m =8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... So gamma is approximately 6.6667 or 20/3.

3. Next, compute the velocity v. Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so v = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)) c.

So let's compute beta, which is v/c. Beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Gamma is 6.6667, so gamma squared is (20/3)² = 400/9 ≈44.4444. So 1/gamma² = 9/400 =0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225=0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So beta ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887c.

But wait, do I need to calculate it more accurately? Maybe I should do exact calculations.

Alternatively, beta can be approximated using beta ≈ sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E² c^4)) ) * c. Because E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2, so (pc c)^2 = E² - m² c^4. So p = sqrt(E² - m² c^4) / c². But perhaps another approach is better.

Alternatively, beta = sqrt(1 - m²/(E)^2). So since m and E are in GeV, but c is considered in natural units here. Let me think.

Wait, correct formula: beta = sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)) when E is the total energy. So beta = sqrt(1 - (1.2^2) / (8^2)).

Compute that: 1.2 squared is 1.44, 8 squared is 64. So 1.44/64 = 0.0225. 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887 as before. So v ≈ 0.9887c.

But for precise calculation, perhaps I should use more exact numbers. Hmm, but maybe the approximation is good enough.

4. Now, putting it all together: L = gamma * beta c * tau.

Wait, let me check the formula again. The mean decay length is L = gamma * beta c * tau.

Because tau is the proper lifetime, and the lifetime observed is gamma tau. So distance is velocity (beta c) multiplied by observed lifetime (gamma tau). So yes, L = beta c gamma tau.

So let's compute each part:

Gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.6666667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1.44)/64) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Tau is ħ / Γ = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

So now, compute L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

So let's compute each factor:

gamma ≈ 6.6666667.

beta ≈ 0.9887.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So let's compute each step:

First, compute beta * c = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Then, gamma * beta * c = 6.6666667 * 2.966e8 ≈ 6.6666667 * 2.966 = about 19.8333e8 m/s.

Wait, let me compute more accurately: 6.6666667 × 2.966e8 = ?

Wait, 6 × 2.966e8 is 1.7796e9, and 0.6666667 × 2.966e8 is approx 1.977e8. So total is about 1.7796e9 + 1.977e8 = 1.9773e9 m/s.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, 6.6666667 times 2.966e8:

Wait, 6.6666667 * 2.966e8 = ?

Calculate 6.6666667 * 2.966 = let's compute 6 * 2.966=17.796, and 0.6666667 * 2.966 ≈ 1.977333.

So total is 17.796 + 1.977333 = 19.77333.

So 19.77333e8 m/s.

Wait, no, wait, 6.6666667 * 2.966e8 = (6.6666667 * 2.966) * 1e8.

So 6.6666667 × 2.966:

Let me compute 2.966 × 6 = 17.796.

2.966 × 0.6666667 ≈ 1.977333.

So total ≈17.796 +1.977333=19.77333.

So 19.77333e8 m/s.

Wait, that's 1.977333e9 m/s. Hmm, that seems correct because beta is close to 1, so v ≈ c, and gamma is about 6.666, so the product gamma * v is around 6.666 * c.

But regardless, moving on.

Now multiply by tau.

So L = gamma * beta * c * tau = 19.77333e8 m/s * tau (2.056875e-24 s).

So 19.77333e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 19.77333e8 * 2.056875e-24 m.

Calculating the exponents: 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.

So multiplying the coefficients: 19.77333 * 2.056875.

Let me compute that:

19.77333 × 2 = 39.54666.

19.77333 × 0.056875 ≈ approximately 19.77333 × 0.05 = 0.9886665, and 19.77333 × 0.006875 ≈ 0.135459. So total around 0.9886665 +0.135459=1.1241255.

So total is ≈ 39.54666 + 1.1241255 ≈ 40.67078.

So 40.67078e-16 m ≈ 4.067078e-15 m.

Wait, that's approximately 4.067e-15 meters.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655 * 10^-15 m.

Option C is 5.0223 *10^-15 m.

So our calculation is about 4.067e-15 m, which is closest to option B.

Wait, but let me check if I made any mistake in the calculations.

Wait, another way: perhaps I should compute everything more accurately.

Let me recompute the product (gamma * beta * c) * tau.

Gamma=8/1.2=6.66666666667.

Beta=sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775).

Compute sqrt(0.9775):

Let me compute 0.9775^0.5.

0.9775 is close to 0.98. sqrt(0.98)= approximately 0.98995.

Wait, more accurately:

Let me compute 0.9887²: (0.9887)^2 = (approx) 0.9887 * 0.9887.

0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.

0.98 * 0.0087 = ~0.008526.

0.0087 * 0.98 = same, 0.008526.

0.0087²= 0.00007569.

So adding them all:

Wait, perhaps better to compute 0.9887^2:

= (0.98 + 0.0087)^2.

= 0.98^2 + 2 * 0.98 * 0.0087 + 0.0087^2.

= 0.9604 + 2*(0.008526) + 0.00007569.

=0.9604 + 0.017052 + 0.00007569.

= 0.9604 + 0.017052 = 0.977452 + 0.00007569 = 0.97752769.

Which is just a bit over 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887.

So beta is 0.9887, which is probably accurate enough.

Gamma is 6.6666667.

So gamma * beta =6.6666667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.6666667 * 0.9887.

Let me compute that:

6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.

0.6666667 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.6666667 *0.98=0.6533333; 0.6666667*0.0087≈0.0058. So 0.6533333+0.0058≈0.659133.

So total gamma*beta ≈5.9322 + 0.659133 ≈6.59133.

Wait, but wait: 6.6666667 * 0.9887 = ?

Let me compute 6.6666667 × 0.9887.

We can do it as 6 × 0.9887 =5.9322.

0.6666667 × 0.9887 = approximately 0.659133.

So 5.9322 + 0.659133 =6.591333.

So gamma * beta ≈6.591333.

Now, multiply by c and tau.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So gamma * beta * c =6.591333 *3e8 =19.774e8 m/s.

Then, L = (gamma*beta*c) * tau =19.774e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply the coefficients: 19.774 *2.056875 ≈.

Let me compute 20 * 2.056875=41.1375.

But 19.774 is 0.226 less than 20.

So 0.226 *2.056875 ≈0.4647.

So 41.1375 -0.4647=40.6728.

So approximately 40.6728e-16 m.

Which is 4.06728e-15 m.

Looking back at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. That's really close to my result of 4.067e-15.

So the correct answer should be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the width \( \Gamma \) by the uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given:
- \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \),
- \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \),

we calculate:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m}
\]

where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Thus:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the velocity \( \beta \)
The velocity \( \beta \) is given by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}}
\]

Substituting \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.2^2}{8^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.44}{64}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

Substituting:
- \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \),
- \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \tau \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \),

we calculate:

\[
L = (6.6667)(0.9887)(3 \times 10^8)(2.056875 \times 10^{-24}).
\]

First, compute \( \gamma \beta \):

\[
\gamma \beta = 6.6667 \times 0.9887 \approx 6.5913.
\]

Next, compute \( \gamma \beta c \):

\[
\gamma \beta c = 6.5913 \times 3 \times 10^8 \approx 1.9774 \times 10^9 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

Finally, compute \( L \):

\[
L = (1.9774 \times 10^9) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The calculated value \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B**, which is \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).

**Answer: B**
