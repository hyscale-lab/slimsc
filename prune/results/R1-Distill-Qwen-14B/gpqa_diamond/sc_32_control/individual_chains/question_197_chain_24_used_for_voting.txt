Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what I can do. The question is about identifying a product after a reaction. The compound X has some IR and NMR data, and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. So, the starting material probably has a ketone group.

Let me look at the IR data first. The IR peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad range, maybe indicating an -OH stretch or possibly an aldehyde. But wait, another peak is at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) peak, probably a ketone or maybe an ester or acid. But 1720 is lower than a ketone, which is usually around 1700-1750. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, ketones are around 1700-1750. So 1720 would be in that range. So maybe a ketone.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several signals. Let's break it down. The first one is at 10.5 ppm, a broad singlet integrating to 1H. That could be an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, in the IR, we saw 3400-2500, which might suggest an -OH group? Or maybe an acidic proton. If it was an aldehyde, we wouldn't have a peak in that IR region. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid -OH, which would be broad around 10 ppm. Wait, but the IR doesn't show a strong peak around 2500-3000 for O-H. The IR peaks are 3400–2500, which is a pretty broad range. Oh, maybe it's a hydroxyl group, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the 1720 cm-1 is probably a carbonyl. So, if it's a carboxylic acid, that would have a peak around 1700, but the OH would be very broad. But the NMR has a peak at 10.5, which could be a carboxylic acid. But wait, the reaction is Clemmensen, which reduces ketones to alkanes. So if the starting material has a ketone, then the product would lose the carbonyl.

Wait, but wait. The NMR shows a peak at 10.5, which would be a deshielded proton. It could also be an aldehyde, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. If it's a ketone, why is there such a downfield proton? Alternatively, perhaps the structure isn't a ketone but maybe an ester or something else.

Wait, let me think again. If it's a ketone, the product after Clemmensen would be a secondary alcohol turning into an alkane, but wait, no—Clemmensen reduces ketones (RCOR') to RCH2R'. So the product would be an alkane.

Wait, the starting material must be a ketone because of the 1720 peak. So the reaction would convert that ketone into a methylene group. But wait, perhaps the starting material is an aromatic ketone. Let me look at the rest of the NMR.

The next peak is 8.0 ppm, a doublet integrating to 2H. Then 7.2 ppm, another doublet with 2H. That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like para substituents on benzene. So we have two doublets, each integrating to 2H, probably para positions. So the structure has a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions.

Wait, but also, the NMR shows other peaks. At 2.9 ppm, a multiplet for 1H. 1.7 ppm, a multiplet for 2H. 1.4 ppm, a doublet for 3H. And 0.9 ppm, a triplet for 3H. Let's try to piece this together.

The 0.9 triplet is likely a methyl group attached to a CH2, like in an ethyl chain. So that's probably a -CH2CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm doublet for 3H might be a CH3 attached to a CH, maybe like CH2CH(CH3)-. Hmm, or perhaps a methyl adjacent to a CH group.

Wait, let's think about the structure. The aromatic part is para-substituted. So perhaps the benzene ring has two substituents. One substituent is a ketone group (since IR has 1720), but wait, if the starting material is a ketone, after Clemmensen it becomes a methylene group.

Wait, let me think. If the starting material is a benzophenone derivative, say, a substituted acetophenone. So, the substituent on the benzene would be a group like RCO-.

Wait, the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is very downfield. So if that's a carbonyl proton, like an aldehyde, perhaps. But wait, aldehydes typically don't have protons attached to the carbonyl, unless it's an aldehyde. Wait, no, aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm. But in that case, the IR should show a strong peak around 2800 cm-1 (stretching for the aldehyde C-H). Wait, but the IR here is 3400–2500, which is a broad range, possibly O-H or N-H, but it's more likely O-H for an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 peak is a carboxylic acid -OH. But then the IR should have a strong peak around 1700 for the carbonyl. Wait, the IR has 1720; that's a strong carbonyl. So if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, but maybe a bit higher? Hmm.

Wait, but the starting material is reacting with red phosphorus and HI, which is the Clemmensen reagent. Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes, but if the starting material has a carbonyl that's not a ketone, like an ester or acid, would that react? Wait, no, Clemmensen doesn't usually reduce esters or acids. It's specific for ketones and aldehydes. Oh wait, aldehydes can be reduced to CH2 groups. So if the starting material is an aldehyde, it would become CH2 after Clemmensen.

Wait, but the IR shows 1720, which is a carbonyl. If it's an aldehyde, the carbonyl would be around 2800 (stretching) and 1720 maybe? Wait, no, the carbonyl peak for an aldehyde is around 1720? I thought aldehydes are a bit higher, around 1700-1750. So maybe that's compatible.

But the NMR shows a peak at 10.5, which is a bit downfield for an aldehyde. Wait, but maybe it's an aromatic aldehyde. Like benzaldehyde, which has a proton at around 10 ppm. So maybe the structure is something like benzaldehyde with a substituent.

Wait, let's consider the aromatic protons. The 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted benzene. So the substituents are in the para positions. One substituent is the carbonyl group (either ketone or aldehyde), and the other substituent is some alkyl group.

Wait, but looking at the other NMR peaks. At 2.9 ppm, a multiplet for 1H. That could be a CH group adjacent to another CH2 or similar. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to a CH, and the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is likely a CH3 group attached to a CH. So putting that together, perhaps a substituent like -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-, but wait, what would that look like? Maybe a substituent like R = -CH(CH2CH2CH3), but let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzophenone with a substituent that includes a CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached in a way that creates a branching.

Wait, let's think about the substituent on the benzene. If the benzene is para-substituted, one substituent is the carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde), and the other is an alkyl group. Let me see what the NMR is telling me.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a methylene (CH2) adjacent to another group. Wait, but the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H, which could be a CH2 next to a CH group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH. So perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-.

Wait, let me imagine the substituent as -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. But wait, that would require the substituent to be a larger group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. Let me think: the 0.9 triplet is a CH2CH2CH3 group, so maybe it's a propyl group attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH, which is attached to the benzene.

Wait, putting it all together: benzene ring with two substituents in para positions. One substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone), and the other substituent is a group like CH(CH2CH2CH3). Because the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is a terminal methyl group, so that would be from a -CH2CH2CH3 group.

So perhaps the structure is 4-(propan-2-yl)acetophenone? Or something similar. Wait, or maybe the substituent is a propyl group with branching. Let me think: the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which suggests it's attached to a CH group that is adjacent to another CH2. So maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Hmm, but that would make the structure a bit more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. Let me think: an isobutyl group would have a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, that's a pentyl group. Isobutyl is (CH2)2CHCH2, no. Wait, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)? Wait, no, isobutyl is (CH2)2CHCH3. No, wait, no. Let me think again. Isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)? No, wait, no. Isobutyl is (CH(CH2CH3))CH2-? No. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No. Wait, no, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3), but I'm getting myself mixed up. Perhaps it's better to think of the substituent as a tertiary butyl group. But the NMR doesn't show a singlet for a methyl group attached to a tertiary carbon, so maybe that's not the case.

Wait, another approach: the NMR data has a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is likely a methylene (CH) group. Then 1.7 (m, 2H) is another CH2 group, and 1.4 (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. So the substituent is probably a group like -CH(CH2CH2CH3). So that would be a four-carbon chain: benzene-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CO-something.

Wait, but the starting material is a ketone, so perhaps the substituents are a ketone (like -COR) and another substituent which is an alkyl group.

Wait, let me try to draw this. The benzene ring is para-substituted. One substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone), and the other substituent is an isobutyl group or something similar.

Wait, the substituent: the 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which is next to a CH2. The 1.7 ppm (2H) is a CH2 group. The 2.9 ppm (1H) is a CH group. So the substituent could be a butyl group, perhaps a secondary butyl (like -CH(CH2CH2CH3)).

Wait, maybe the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let's see: sec-butyl is -CH(CH2CH2CH3). No, wait, sec-butyl is -CH(CH2CH3)CH2? No, wait, no, the correct structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, the structure for a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? I think I'm getting confused. Let's think in terms of structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene. So the substituent would be a propyl chain with a branch. Hmm.

Wait, the 0.9 triplet (3H) indicates a -CH2CH2CH3 group. So that would be a propyl group. The 1.4 doublet (3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. So the substituent would be something like -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-? Hmm, not quite.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So the structure would be benzene with a substituent like -CH(CH2CH2CH3), and another substituent which is a carbonyl group.

Wait, but then the benzene would have two substituents: one carbonyl (like O=C-), and another substituent which is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group.

So the structure would be:

Phenyl group with two substituents: one is a ketone (like R-CO-) and the other is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, in the para position.

But wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So that's probably a ketone.

So the starting material is 4-(something)acetophenone. Let's think about the substituent.

The substituent on the benzene is a group that has a CH, CH2, and CH3. So perhaps it's a 4-(isobutyl)acetophenone?

Wait, but let me think about the NMR. The substituent's protons would show up in the regions given.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would correspond to the CH group in the substituent. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the adjacent CH2. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is the methyl attached to the CH. And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is the terminal methyl of the ethyl group (if it's a propyl group).

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. So maybe it's a 4-(butyl)acetophenone. But then the butyl group would have more protons. Hmm, but the NMR only shows specific signals. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a (CH2CH(CH3)) group. So, the substituent would be a secondary butyl group, or an isobutyl group. Let's see. For isobutyl group, the structure is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2CH2CH3) group attached to a CH, which is attached to the benzene. So the substituent is -CH(CH2CH2CH3) attached to the benzene. That would make the substituent a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, now, considering the substituent as -CH(CH2CH2CH3), then the NMR would show:

The CH (2.9 ppm, m, 1H) would be the CH group.

The CH2 between CH and CH2CH2CH3 would have protons at around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).

The CH2CH2CH3 would have the terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), and the middle CH2 would perhaps be around 1.4 ppm. Wait, no, the middle CH2 would be split into a quartet or something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think in terms of the substituent.

Another approach: The substituent has a structure where the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 (3H), so that's a -CH2CH2CH3 group (a propyl group). The adjacent CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm, and the CH would be at 2.9 ppm. The CH3 attached to that CH would be at 1.4 ppm, as a doublet. So the substituent is a group that goes benzene-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CO- something. Wait, but the CO is part of the ketone.

So, putting it all together, the structure would be 4-(propane-2-yl)acetophenone? Or perhaps 4-(isobutyl)acetophenone.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the reaction. The starting material is a ketone which will be reduced to a methylene group. So the product will have a CH2 where the carbonyl was.

Wait, if the starting material is 4-(isobutyl)acetophenone, then after Clemmensen reduction, the ketone (acetophenone part) would become CH2, giving 4-(isobutyl)propane-1-phenyl? No, wait, acetophenone is benzene with a ketone group (Ar-CO-R). When reduced, it becomes Ar-CH2-R, but wait, no: Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes. So Ar-CO-R becomes Ar-CH2-R. Wait, no, Ar-CO-R would reduce to Ar-CH2-R? No, wait, no, wait.

Wait, no. Acetophenone is Ar-CO-CH3. Clemmensen would reduce that to Ar-CH2-CH3. So the ketone group (CO) becomes a methylene group (CH2). So the product would be ethylbenzene, but that's not considering the substituent.

Wait, no, the starting material is a para-substituted benzene with a ketone and another substituent. So if the substituent is R, then the starting material is Ar-CO-R. After reduction, it becomes Ar-CH2-R.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. Let's say the structure is (para-substituted benzene) with a ketone group, so the structure is Ar-CO-R. Upon Clemmensen reduction, the ketone (RCOR') becomes RCH2R'. So in this case, the Ar-CO-R becomes Ar-CH2-R.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no: acetophenone is C6H5-CO-CH3. After reduction, it becomes C6H5-CH2-CH3. So the product is ethylbenzene.

But in this case, the starting material is para-substituted, so perhaps it's 4-(something)acetophenone. So for example, it's 4-R-acetophenone, which would reduce to 4-R-ethylbenzene.

Wait, but in the NMR, after reduction, the product would have the substituents as R and a CH2CH3 group. Wait, but let me look at the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

Wait, but that's a carboxylic acid. But the starting material had a ketone, which would be reduced, not oxidized. So probably not.

Option B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. Structure would be para-xylene with isobutyl substituent? Not sure.

Option C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Again, a carboxylic acid, which doesn't fit with Clemmensen.

Option D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Wait, that would be a toluene with a sec-butyl group in the para position.

Wait, perhaps the product is an alkylbenzene where the substituents are a methyl group and a sec-butyl group in para positions.

Wait, but let me think again. The starting material's NMR suggests a substituent with a CH, CH2, and CH3 groups. So the substituent is a secondary butyl group. So after reduction, the ketone becomes a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone. Then, after reduction, it becomes 4-(sec-butyl)ethylbenzene. That would be 1-(sec-butyl)-4-ethylbenzene. But looking at the options, option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Wait, the starting material would have a substituent R and a COCH3 group. After reduction, it becomes R and a CH2CH3 group.

So the substituents are:

On the benzene ring, at para positions, one is a R group and the other is CH2CH3.

In the starting material, R is a group that has a CH, CH2, CH3. So R is a butyl group.

Ah, perhaps R is an isobutyl group.

Wait, let me imagine the starting material is 4-isobutylacetophenone. Then the structure would be benzene with a COCH3 and an isobutyl group in para positions.

After reduction, the COCH3 becomes CH2CH3. So the product would be benzene with isobutyl and ethyl groups in para positions. So the product would be 4-isobutyl-ethylbenzene, which is 1-isobutyl-4-ethylbenzene.

But looking at the options, option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. Wait, that has a methyl group instead of ethyl. So perhaps that's not matching.

Alternatively, did I make a mistake in the starting material's substituent?

Wait, perhaps the R group is not an isobutyl but a different substituent.

Let me re-examine the NMR data of the starting material.

The 1H NMR has:

δ 10.5 (bs, 1H) → possibly an aromatic aldehyde proton. Or a carboxylic acid proton.

δ 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H) → para-substituted aromatic.

δ 2.9 (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), 0.9 (t, 3H).

The 0.9 triplet (3H) suggests a -CH2CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 doublet (3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH, which is adjacent to a CH2. The 1.7 ppm (2H) is a CH2 group next to that CH.

So the substituent R is likely a group like -CH(CH2CH2CH3).

Wait, so substituent R is like -CH(CH2CH2CH3). So the group would be a secondary butyl group, perhaps an isoamyl group? No, isoamyl is a 4-methylpentyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps R is a propyl group with a branch, like a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So, the substituent R is a tert-butyl group? No, because tert-butyl would have a singlet for the methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps R is a 2-methylpropyl group, which is an isobutyl group. So R is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, no, that's not possible. Isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps R is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. So that would be a neopentyl group? No, neopentyl is -CH2C(CH3)2.

Alternatively, perhaps R is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So that would be a substituent attached to the benzene as -CH(CH2CH2CH3).

So, the substituent R is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So, when the ketone is reduced, the starting material's structure would be:

Ph–CO–CH(CH2CH2CH3), where Ph is the para-substituted benzene. Wait, no, actually, the starting material is Ph–CO–R, with R being CH(CH2CH2CH3).

After Clemmensen reduction, the CO would become CH2, so the product would be Ph–CH2–CH(CH2CH2CH3), which is 4-(propyl group)ethylbenzene.

Wait, but the substituent R is -CH(CH2CH2CH3), so the product becomes Ph–CH2–CH(CH2CH2CH3). So the substituents are CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3) and the other substituent is a methyl group? No, wait, no.

Wait, no, the para substitution would have two substituents. One is the -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, and the other is the CO group, which becomes CH2 after reduction.

Wait, no, wait. No, the starting material has a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions: one is a carbonyl group (like a ketone), and the other is a group R. So after reduction, the ketone becomes CH2, so the substituents are R and CH2CH3.

Wait, but looking at the options, the product would have two substituents in the para positions. So if the starting material has R as a substituent, and the other is a ketone, then after reduction, the substituents are R and CH2CH3.

Looking at the options:

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. So substituents are isobutyl and methyl, para.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So substituents are sec-butyl and methyl, para.

But in our analysis, the substituent R was a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, which is -CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that's a butyl group.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck because the substituent is a butyl group. Let me try to think again.

Another approach: the starting material's NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which suggests a -CH2CH2CH3 group. So that's a propyl group. The 1.4 ppm (3H, d) is a methyl attached to a CH, which is next to a CH2. So the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, which is a secondary butyl group.

So the substituent R is a secondary butyl group. So the starting material is 4-(secondary butyl)acetophenone.

After reduction, the acetophenone group (COCH3) becomes CH2CH3. So the product is 4-(secondary butyl)ethylbenzene.

Wait, but in the options, I don't see that structure. Let me check the options again.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

So, the substituents in the product would be a sec-butyl group and a methyl group, para.

But in our analysis, the substituent R is a sec-butyl group, and the other substituent is a CH2CH3. So perhaps the product is 4-(sec-butyl)ethylbenzene, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the substituent R is a methyl group, and the other substituent is a ketone. But then the NMR wouldn't show such a complex substituent.

Wait, maybe the starting material is 4-methylacetophenone. Then after reduction, it becomes 4-methylpropane benzene. But that doesn't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is something like 4-(propan-2-yl)acetophenone. Then upon reduction, it becomes 4-(propan-2-yl)propan-1-phenyl. Wait, no, the product would be 4-(propan-2-yl)ethylbenzene.

Hmm, I'm not finding a match in the options. Let me think about the options again.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. Structure would be benzene with isobutyl and methyl in para.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's benzene with sec-butyl and methyl in para.

So in the product, substituents are a methyl and a butyl group. But in the starting material, the substituents would have been a methyl and a ketone group. Because the starting material's NMR shows a substituent with branching, perhaps not a methyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think what the product would look like.

If the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone, then the product after reduction would be 4-(sec-butyl)ethylbenzene. But none of the options directly match that.

Looking at the options, the closest are options B and D, which have a methyl and a butyl group. So perhaps the starting material had a methyl group and a ketone group in the para positions.

Wait, but in the starting material's NMR, there's a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which suggests a propyl group. So perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, not a methyl.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to approach it from another angle.

The IR data shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. So the starting material has a carbonyl, probably a ketone.

The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is a CH2CH2CH3 group. So the substituent must have a propyl chain.

The NMR also shows a 1.4 ppm doublet (3H), which is a methyl group attached to a CH. So the substituent is a group where a methyl is attached to a CH, which is attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH2CH2CH3 group.

Putting that together, the substituent is -CH(CH2CH2CH3). So the structure is benzene with substituents at para positions: one is -COCH3 (from acetophenone), and the other is -CH(CH2CH2CH3).

After Clemmensen reduction, the COCH3 becomes CH2CH3. So the product would have substituents -CH2CH3 and -CH(CH2CH2CH3) in para positions.

So the product structure is 4-(propyl group)ethylbenzene.

But looking at the options, option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, and option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Neither of these match.

Wait, perhaps the substituent R is not a butyl group but a methyl group. But then the NMR wouldn't show the signals we're seeing.

Wait, maybe the starting material has a substituent that's a methyl group and a ketone. But that doesn't align with the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, making the product have a substituent that's a -CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3) group? No, I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the starting material is a benzoic acid derivative, but that doesn't fit with the IR and NMR. No, because the reaction is Clemmensen, which would reduce a ketone but not a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another thought: the starting material could be a benzaldehyde derivative. So, the substituent is a benzaldehyde group (CHO) and another substituent.

But in that case, the IR wouldn't have a peak at 1720. Aldehydes have lower carbonyl peaks, around 1720 might fit, but the NMR would show the aldehyde proton around 9-10 ppm. The starting material's NMR shows a peak at 10.5, which could be an aldehyde.

If the starting material is a benzaldehyde with a substituent, then after Clemmensen reduction, the aldehyde becomes a CH2 group.

Wait, but the IR has a peak at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad range. That could be an O-H stretch, but if it's an aldehyde, that's not present. So perhaps the 3400–2500 is from an alcohol or an aldehyde's C-H stretch.

But wait, the NMR shows a 10.5 peak, which is more downfield than an aldehyde. So perhaps it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the IR shows 1720, which is a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, but higher for some acids. Also, the NMR would show a broad peak from the -OH, which we have at 10.5 ppm.

So maybe the starting material is a substituted benzoic acid.

In that case, the reaction with Clemmensen wouldn't occur, since Clemmensen reduces ketones and aldehydes, not carboxylic acids. So that can't be right.

So, back to the starting point: the starting material has a ketone group, which is reduced to a CH2 group.

The product would have a CH2 group where the ketone was. So the substituent is R and CH2CH3 in para.

But looking at the options, the only option that has two substituents in para is B and D.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. So substituents are isobutyl and methyl.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Substituents are sec-butyl and methyl.

So, if the starting material was 4-methylacetophenone, then after reduction, it would become 4-methylethylbenzene, which is 1-ethyl-4-methylbenzene. But that's not one of the options. The options have isobutyl or sec-butyl as substituents.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-(isobutyl)acetophenone. Then upon reduction, it becomes 4-(isobutyl)ethylbenzene. But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a different substituent. Maybe the substituent is a methyl group, and the other substituent is a ketone. Then, after reduction, the product would have a methyl and an ethyl group in para.

But looking at the options, option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. So substituents are isobutyl and methyl. So perhaps the starting material had a substituent which upon reduction becomes isobutyl.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's substituent R is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. So after reduction, it becomes -CH2CH(CH3)2, which is isobutyl.

Wait, the starting material would be 4-(tert-butyl)acetophenone. No, because the NMR doesn't show the tert-butyl peak.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-(propan-2-yl)acetophenone. Then after reduction, it becomes 4-(propan-2-yl)ethylbenzene. Which would be 4-(isobutyl)ethylbenzene. But looking at the options, option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, which is different.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the product structure based on the options.

Option C is a benzoic acid, which isn't the product because we're reducing, not oxidizing.

Option A is a propanoic acid, which would come from a ketone via oxidation, not reduction.

So options B and D are the possibilities.

If the product is option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, then the starting material would have been 4-methylpropanophenone (if that's a thing). No, perhaps the starting material was 4-methylacetophenone, which upon reduction becomes 4-methylethylbenzene, but that's not option B.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent R in the starting material is a methyl group, and the other substituent is a ketone. Then, after reduction, the product has a methyl and an ethyl group in para positions. But that's not any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent R is a propyl group, and the other substituent is a ketone. Then, after reduction, the product would have a propyl and an ethyl group in para positions.

But the options don't have that either.

Wait, maybe the substituent R is a methyl group and another substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a di-substituted benzene with a ketone and a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent R is a (CH2CH(CH3)) group, making it a sec-butyl group. So the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone. Then upon reduction, it becomes 4-(sec-butyl)ethylbenzene, which would be 1-(sec-butyl)-4-ethylbenzene. But none of the options match that.

Wait, looking back at the NMR data: the 10.5 ppm peak could be a carboxylic acid proton, but the reaction doesn't fit. So perhaps it's an aldehyde.

Wait, if the starting material is a benzaldehyde derivative with a substituent, then after reduction, the aldehyde becomes CH2. But the IR would show a strong aldehyde peak around 2800 and 1720. Let me think.

But the NMR shows a peak at 10.5, which could be an aldehyde. Then, the IR would show the aldehyde's C=O around 1720. So perhaps the starting material is 4-something benzaldehyde.

But then the reaction would reduce the aldehyde to CH2, and the substituent would remain.

Wait, let's say the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde. Then, after reduction, it becomes 4-(sec-butyl)propane-1-phenyl? No, no, the aldehyde would become CH2.

So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)propan-1-phenyl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent in the starting material is a methyl group, and the other is a benzaldehyde. Then, the product would be 4-methylpropan-1-phenyl. But this doesn't match the options.

Hmm. I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should try to look for another approach.

Another plan: The starting material has an IR peak at 1720 cm-1 (carbonyl). The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is a CH2CH2CH3 group. So, the substituent has a propyl chain.

So the substituent is a propyl group. So, the starting material is 4-propylacetophenone. Upon reduction, it becomes 4-propylethylbenzene, which would be 4-(propyl)ethylbenzene.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps the substituent is a butyl group.

Wait, but the NMR shows a -CH2CH2CH3 group. So, the substituent is a propyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group and a propyl group, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, but the NMR only shows the end of the chain.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Let me try to look for the correct answer by process of elimination.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid → acid, so probably not.

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene → substituents are isobutyl and methyl.

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid → acid, no.

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene → substituents are sec-butyl and methyl.

So, the product has a methyl and a butyl group in para positions.

So, the starting material must have been a ketone in one substituent and a methyl group in the other.

So, the starting material is 4-methylacetophenone. Upon reduction, the ketone becomes CH2CH3. So the product would be 4-methylethylbenzene, which is 1-ethyl-4-methylbenzene. But that's not any of the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 4-isobutylacetophenone. Then, upon reduction, it becomes 4-isobutylethylbenzene, which is 1-ethyl-4-isobutylbenzene. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think about the substituent.

The 1H NMR of the starting material shows:

At 1.4 ppm, a doublet (3H): likely a CH3 attached to a CH.

At 2.9 ppm, a multiplet (1H): likely a CH group.

At 1.7 ppm, a multiplet (2H): likely a CH2 group.

And at 0.9 ppm, a triplet (3H): likely a CH2CH2CH3.

Putting this together, the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene.

So the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So the substituent is a secondary butyl group.

So the starting material is 4-(secondary butyl)acetophenone.

Upon reduction, the acetophenone becomes CH2CH3. So the product is 4-(secondary butyl)ethylbenzene. So the substituents are a secondary butyl group and an ethyl group in para positions.

Looking at the options, this doesn't match any option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)2 group. But I don't think that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, which is a tertiary butyl group. But tertiary butyl would have a singlet for the three methyl groups in the NMR.

Wait, no, the substituent is a secondary butyl group.

Hmm. Given the time I've spent without finding a clear match, perhaps I should look for the option that best fits the NMR data of the starting material.

The starting material's NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which suggests a propyl group attached to a CH2. The 1.4 ppm doublet suggests a CH3 attached to a CH. So the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So the substituent is a secondary butyl group.

After reduction, the product would have a substituent of -CH(CH2CH2CH3) and a CH2CH3 in the para position. So the product would be 4-(secondary butyl)ethylbenzene.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps the correct answer is option D, 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Wait, but that would mean the substituent after reduction is a sec-butyl and a methyl. So the starting substituent must have been a methyl and a ketone. But in that case, the NMR wouldn't show the branching we're seeing.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent after reduction is a sec-butyl group, meaning the starting substituent was a -CO-sec-butyl group. But that doesn't align with the NMR.

I think I'm stuck. So perhaps I should go with option D, as the substituents are a sec-butyl and methyl, which are common in such reactions.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the product of a reaction where Compound X, characterized by given IR and NMR data, undergoes Clemmensen reduction with red phosphorus and HI. The reaction reduces a ketone group to a methylene group, transforming the starting material into an alkane.

### Analysis of IR Data:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Suggests the presence of an -OH group or possibly an aldehyde C-H stretch.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Indicates a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, likely from a ketone.

### Analysis of NMR Data:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, likely from an -OH group or an aldehyde proton.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted aromatic ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: Likely a methylene (CH) group adjacent to other groups.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: Likely a methylene (CH₂) group adjacent to a CH.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet integrating to 3H, likely a methyl group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, likely a terminal methyl group in a propyl chain.

### Structure of Compound X:
The NMR data suggests a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents:
1. A ketone group (from the IR and the presence of a carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹).
2. A branched alkyl group, likely a secondary butyl group (-CH(CH₂CH₂CH₃)), based on the signals at 2.9 ppm (CH), 1.7 ppm (CH₂), 1.4 ppm (CH₃), and 0.9 ppm (CH₂CH₂CH₃).

Thus, Compound X is likely **4-(secondary butyl)acetophenone**.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI (Clemmensen Reduction):
The Clemmensen reduction converts the ketone group (-CO-) into a methylene group (-CH₂-). Therefore, the product will have:
- A para-substituted benzene ring.
- One substituent as a secondary butyl group (-CH(CH₂CH₂CH₃)).
- The other substituent as an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) resulting from the reduction of the ketone.

### Matching with Options:
- **Option A (2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid)**: Incorrect, as the product is not a carboxylic acid.
- **Option B (1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene)**: Incorrect, as it suggests a methyl group and an isobutyl group, which does not align with the starting material's substituents.
- **Option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid)**: Incorrect, as the product is not a carboxylic acid.
- **Option D (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene)**: Incorrect, as it suggests a methyl group and a sec-butyl group, which does not match the starting material's substituents.

### Conclusion:
The analysis suggests that none of the options perfectly match the expected product. However, based on the closest alignment with the substituents and the reaction mechanism, **Option D (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene)** is the most reasonable choice, despite minor discrepancies in the substituent analysis.
