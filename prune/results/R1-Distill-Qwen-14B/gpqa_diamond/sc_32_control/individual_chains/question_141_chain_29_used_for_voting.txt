Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it again. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products there are from this reaction.

Hmm, wait, what's 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, right, that's bromobenzene. The "d" probably stands for something, maybe the position. Oh wait, no, wait. 1-bromobenzene would be bromine attached at position 1 of benzene, but wait, benzene is a ring with six positions. Wait, 1-bromobenzene is the same as bromobenzene, right? Because benzene is a six-membered ring, and numbering can be a bit tricky, but in this case, it's position 1.

Wait, but the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, maybe the d is a deuterium? Oh, right! Sometimes, when you have a deuterated compound, you'll see things like -d, -d2, etc. So 1-bromobenzene-2-d would mean that the benzene ring has bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. So the structure is bromobenzene with a deuterium on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, benzene is a ring of six carbons. So position 1 is where the bromine is, position 2 would be next to that. So the structure is a benzene ring with Br at C1 and a D (deuterium) at C2. So the molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I'm trying to remember what NaNH2 does in such conditions. Oh, right! NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. In aromatic chemistry, it's used for deprotonating arenes to form benzyne intermediates, which can undergo various reactions, like the benzidine rearrangement or the formation of benzynes that can react with other nucleophiles.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. When benzene is treated with a strong base like NaNH2 in liquid NH3, it can form a benzene anion, which is a strong base. But in this case, the starting material is bromobenzene with a deuterium adjacent.

So, the first step would probably be deprotonation. But where can the base abstract a proton? Let's see: the molecule is Br at C1 and D at C2. So the ring has Br at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2.

So the question is, where are the protons that can be abstracted? Well, the base NaNH2 is a strong base, but in this case, the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is a polar aprotic solvent, I think. So in such conditions, NaNH2 would abstract protons from the most acidic positions.

In aromatic chemistry, the acidity of protons is influenced by the substituents. Electronegative groups like bromine increase the acidity of the adjacent protons because they stabilize the negative charge upon deprotonation via resonance or inductive effects.

So, in bromobenzene, the protons adjacent to the bromine (ortho positions) are more acidic. But wait, in this molecule, the adjacent proton might be deuterated. Let me visualize the structure again.

The structure would be:

Positions:

1: Br

2: D

3: H (assuming the rest are H)

So, the molecule would be:

Br-C1 - C2 (D) - C3 (H) - C4 (H) - C5 (H) - C6 (H)

Wait, actually, no. Benzene is a ring, so position 1 is Br, position 2 is D, position 3 is H, position 4 is H, position 5 is H, position 6 is H.

So, the adjacent positions to Br (position 1) are positions 2 and 6. But position 2 has a D, so the base can only abstract protons from position 6 and any other positions that are ortho or para to the substituents.

Wait, but wait. In bromobenzene, the ortho, para positions are more acidic because the bromine is electron-withdrawing. So the H's at positions 2 and 4 (ortho) and 6 (para?) Wait, no. Wait, in benzene, the substituents' positions are as follows: the substituent at position 1 (Br) has ortho at 2 and 6, meta at 3 and 5, and para at 4.

So the H's in the ortho positions (2 and 6) and para (4) are more acidic. But in this compound, position 2 has a D, so the H at position 6 is the ortho H to Br. So the H in position 6 is more acidic and can be abstracted by the base.

Wait, but wait a second. Also, the H in position 4 (para to Br) is more acidic because the Br is electron-withdrawing. So the H in position 4 is also a candidate for deprotonation.

So, the possible sites where H can be removed are positions 6 and 4.

Wait, but position 2 has D, which is a heavier isotope but doesn't change the acidity much. So the H at position 6 is ortho to Br and can be abstracted, and the H at position 4 is para to Br and can be abstracted.

So when the base (NaNH2) abstracts a proton, we'd get a benzene ring with a negative charge. But wait, in this case, the deprotonation would create a conjugated base.

But wait, in the presence of Br, which is a good leaving group, perhaps elimination could happen after deprotonation. So the base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a benzyne intermediate.

Wait, but in this case, the Br is at position 1. So if the base abstracts a proton from position 2 (which is D, so no H there), or from position 6, which is ortho. Alternatively, if the base abstracts a proton from position 4, which is para, but that's not adjacent, so perhaps elimination would not form a triple bond there.

Wait, but if H is abstracted from position 6 (ortho to Br), then the adjacent positions (5 and 7, but wait, benzene is a ring, so positions are 1-6), so position 6 is adjacent to position 1 (Br) and position 5.

So, if the base abstracts H from position 6, we have a negative charge at position 6. Then, the Br is at position 1, which is adjacent (ortho) to position 6. So the Br could leave as Br-, and a triple bond could form between C1 and C6, but wait, that would be a triple bond between C1 and C6. But wait, the benzene ring is a six-membered ring, so positions 1 and 6 are adjacent (they're next to each other), so the triple bond would be between adjacent carbons, which would form a benzyne (aryne) intermediate.

Wait, benzynes are formed when two substituents are eliminated, creating a triple bond. So in this case, if H is abstracted from position 6, and the Br leaves, a triple bond would form between C1 and C6. So that would generate a benzyne intermediate.

Alternatively, if the base abstracts a proton from position 4, which is para to the Br. But position 4 is not adjacent, so elimination would require the Br and the H to be on adjacent positions. So if H is abstracted from position 4, which is across from Br, that's not adjacent, so elimination may not occur. So perhaps the major pathway is deprotonation at ortho position (position 6), leading to elimination of Br- and forming a triple bond.

Wait, but in this specific compound, there's a deuterium at position 2. So the H at position 6 is the only ortho H available for abstraction, since position 2 has D. So the base will abstract the H at position 6, leading to deprotonation and elimination of Br- to form a triple bond between C1 and C6.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, can the base abstract a proton from a different position? Let's think. The compound is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So the structure is Br at position 1, D at 2. The other positions (3,4,5,6) have H.

Looking at the substituents, the Br is at 1. So the ortho positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 has D, so the H at 6 is the only available ortho H. The para position is 4.

So, when the base abstracts the H at 6, we get a benzene ring with a negative charge at 6, adjacent to Br at 1. So the Br leaves, and a triple bond forms between 1 and 6. Thus, the ring becomes a benzyne (aryne) with the triple bond between 1 and 6.

Wait, but in the formation of benzynes, two substituents are eliminated, but in this case, the substituents are Br and H. Wait, no, wait. Benzyne is formed when two substituents (like X and Y) are on adjacent carbons and are eliminated, forming a triple bond. But in this case, the substituents are Br at 1 and H at 6. So when deprotonated, the H is abstracted from 6, and the Br leaves, leading to the formation of a triple bond between 1 and 6. So that's the way benzyne is formed.

So after elimination, the triple bond is between C1 and C2? Wait, no, C1 and C6 are adjacent, so the triple bond would be between them, which are positions 1 and 6. So the triple bond is between 1 and 6, making the structure a benzyne (like o-benzyne).

Wait, but wait. The positions are numbered in a six-membered ring, so position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. So if the triple bond forms between 1 and 6, that's possible.

So after the elimination, the product is a benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C6.

Now, what happens next? Benzyne can undergo various reactions, such as cycloadditions or trapping with nucleophiles. But in this reaction, what's present? The solvent is condensed ammonia, and the base is NaNH2. So perhaps the benzyne can react with ammonia or another nucleophile.

Wait, but in the presence of NaNH2 and NH3, the benzyne might react with ammonia as a nucleophile. So the triple bond in benzyne is a good dienophile and can undergo [2+2] reactions, but perhaps in this case, the reaction is more about trapping the benzyne with a nucleophile.

Alternatively, when benzyne is formed, it can react with amines or other nucleophiles. If the solution has ammonia, which is a source of NH2- ions, perhaps the benzyne can react with the amide ion.

Wait, but another possibility: once the benzyne is formed, perhaps it can undergo ring-opening reactions. For example, the triple bond can react with a nucleophile to form a substituted benzene.

Wait, but let me think: when benzyne is generated, it's a highly strained molecule and is quite reactive. So in this solvent, it's likely to react quickly.

So, considering that, the benzyne (aryne) would react with the amide ion (NH2^-) available in the solution. The possible reaction would be the triple bond undergoing a [2+2] cycloaddition, but in this case, perhaps the nucleophile adds to the triple bond.

Alternatively, when a triple bond is formed, the ring becomes antiaromatic if not stabilized, so the reaction tends to proceed quickly.

Wait, another thought: the benzyne could react with another equivalent of NaNH2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the benzyne could dimerize, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dearomatization, forming a diradical or a cyclohexene derivative. Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, the triple bond could be attacked by the amide ion.

Wait, the amide ion (NH2^-) is a strong nucleophile. So when the benzyne is formed, the triple bond is between C1 and C6, and perhaps the amide ion can attack the triple bond to form a new ring.

Wait, but to clarify, when a benzyne (aryne) reacts with a nucleophile like NH2^-, it can add across the triple bond in a [2+2] cycloaddition, forming a bicyclic structure. Alternatively, it can form a substitution product.

Wait, I think that when an aryl halide is treated with a strong base like NaNH2 in liquid NH3, it forms the benzyne intermediate, which can then dimerize or react with another molecule. But in this case, perhaps in the presence of NH3, the benzyne could add ammonia across the triple bond.

Wait, another possibility is that upon formation of the benzyne, it can undergo a [2+2] cycloaddition with another aryl group, but that's more about dimerization. Alternatively, the benzyne could trap the amide ion, forming an azabenzyne.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact products here. Let me think again.

The starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. When treated with NaNH2 in NH3, the Br is at C1, D at C2. The base abstracts the H from C6 (ortho to Br), leading to the elimination of Br^- and the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6, creating a benzene ring with a triple bond (benzyne).

Now, this benzyne is highly reactive and can react with various nucleophiles. In this case, the solvent is NH3 (condensed). So the amide ion (NH2^-) is present. So the benzyne can react with NH2^-.

How? Well, the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The amide ion could attack one of the carbons of the triple bond, leading to the formation of a new carbon-nitrogen bond.

Wait, but which positions would be attacked? The triple bond is between C1 and C6. So the amide could add to C1 or C6.

Wait, but in the triple bond, each carbon is sp-hybridized. So each carbon has two regions of high electron density.

So when the amide ion attacks, it could add to either end, leading to different products.

Alternatively, the addition could be on the same face (syn) or opposite (anti), but in this case, perhaps the regiochemistry isn't a factor if both positions are equivalent.

Wait, but wait. The original benzene had Br at 1 and D at 2. Once the triple bond forms between 1 and 6, the positions 2 and 6 are adjacent. So, no, that's not directly relevant.

Wait, perhaps the addition of the amide ion would occur on either end of the triple bond, leading to two different products.

Wait, but the positions of the triple bond are between C1 and C6. So if the amide ion adds to C1, the product would have a substituent at C1. If it adds to C6, a substituent at C6.

But the original structure had Br at C1 and D at C2. So, in the benzyne, the triple bond is between C1 and C6, so the benzene ring has a triple bond between those.

After adding NH2^- to C1, the product would have an NH2 group at C1, but wait, after elimination, C1 would be part of the triple bond, so perhaps the addition would form a new ring structure.

Wait, perhaps the benzyne could undergo a [2+2] cycloaddition with another molecule of the same benzyne, but that would produce a bicyclic structure, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, the benzyne could react with ammonia to form an azabenzene ring. Let me think about that.

Wait, when benzynes react with amines, they can form aromatic amines. For example, the triple bond can react with an amine to form a new aromatic ring with a nitrogen atom. So in this case, the ammonia (NH3) in the solution could act as a nucleophile, leading to a substitution.

Wait, but ammonia is a weak nucleophile compared to the amide ion. Since the solvent is ammonia, but the base is NaNH2, which generates a lot of NH2^- ions.

So, perhaps the benzyne reacts with NH2^-.

The reaction of a benzyne with a strong nucleophile like NH2^- would likely lead to the formation of an aromatic ring with a substituent from the nucleophile.

But wait, another possibility is that the benzyne could dimerize, but that would form a biphenylene structure, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, the benzyne could undergo a ring-opening reaction. For example, the triple bond could open to form a diene, but that's more under specific conditions.

Wait, perhaps the benzyne could react with two equivalents of NH2^- to form a diamine product.

Wait, but the reaction conditions are with NaNH2 in NH3. So perhaps the benzyne is formed and then reacts with NH2^-.

Wait, when benzyne reacts with amines, it typically forms diphenylamine derivatives, but I'm not exactly certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne is not reacting further and just exists as a diradical or something, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that the initial reaction forms a benzyne, which can then react with the amide ion to form a new product.

Wait, but the question is asking about the possible organic products. So how many different products are formed when 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene is treated with NaNH2 in NH3?

Let me break it down.

Step 1: Elimination of H and Br to form benzyne.

Step 2: Reaction of benzyne with NH2^-.

But how many products result from this?

Wait, the benzyne has a triple bond between C1 and C6. When it reacts with NH2^-, the nucleophile can attack either end of the triple bond, leading to different products.

Wait, but in this case, the triple bond is symmetrical because the benzene ring is symmetric around the triple bond?

Wait, no. Because the original compound has a D at position 2, which is adjacent to position 1. So the structure isn't symmetric around the triple bond.

Wait, let me think again. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. The triple bond forms between C1 and C6 upon elimination. Now, in this case, the benzyne's structure would be such that the triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the D is at C2, which is adjacent to C1.

So the structure would have a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a D at C2.

Now, when the amide ion (NH2^-) attacks the triple bond, it can attack at C1 or C6.

If it attacks at C1, the product would have an amino group (-NH2) at C1 and the D at C2.

If it attacks at C6, the product would have an amino group at C6, and D at C2.

But wait, the original Br was at C1, which is now part of the triple bond. So after attack, C1 would have the NH2 group.

So the two possible attack positions are C1 and C6.

But, wait, the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The positions adjacent to the triple bond are C2 and C5 (for C1) and C5 and C6 (wait, no: benzene is a six-membered ring, so C1 is connected to C2 and C6; C6 is connected to C5 and C1).

So, when NH2^- attacks C1, the product would have NH2 at C1, D at C2, and the rest being H.

Similarly, attacking C6 would place NH2 at C6, D at C2, and the rest H.

So that would give two different products: one with NH2 at position 1 and another at position 6.

Wait, but position 6 is the same as position 1 in terms of symmetry? No, because in the original compound, position 2 had the D. So the structure isn't symmetric in that way.

Wait, wait, no. In the starting compound, the positions are:

1: Br

2: D

3: H

4: H

5: H

6: H

After elimination, the triple bond is between 1 and 6. So the structure would be:

- Position 1: triple bond to C6
- Position 2: D
- Position 3: H
- Position 4: H
- Position 5: H
- Position 6: triple bond to C1

So when the triple bond is attacked by NH2^- at C1, the product would have NH2 at C1. Alternatively, attacking at C6 would have NH2 at C6.

But wait, when you add NH2^- to the triple bond, you form a new ring. Let me think about the mechanism.

The reaction of a benzyne with a nucleophile typically involves the attack at one end of the triple bond, leading to the formation of a substituted benzene. The addition would occur across the triple bond, leading to a new structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition would form a new six-membered ring with the NH2 group.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the possible products.

So, after the attack, the product would have the NH2 group at either C1 or C6.

Wait, but let me consider the positions. If the attack is at C1, then the product would have NH2 at C1 and D at C2. But the original Br was at C1, so now we have NH2 at C1.

Alternatively, if attack is at C6, NH2 would be at C6, and D remains at C2.

So those are two different products.

But wait, could there be more products? Let's think.

Is there any possibility of the amide ion attacking both ends of the triple bond, leading to a diamine product? Such as having NH2 groups at both C1 and C6.

Wait, but that would require two equivalents of NH2^- adding to the same triple bond, which might not be feasible in this case.

Alternatively, maybe the attack occurs at both ends, but I'm not sure if that's a standard reaction pathway.

Another possibility: the benzyne could undergo a ring-opening reaction, but I'm not certain about that leading to multiple products.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne could react in a way that results in the formation of a single product, but that depends on the reaction's regioselectivity.

Wait, another thought: the benzyne could undergo a [2+2] cycloaddition with another molecule of itself, forming a bicyclic compound. But that would produce a different product, and I'm not sure if that's the primary reaction here.

But the question is about the possible organic products. Let's count.

If the benzyne reacts with NH2^- and forms products by attacking either end of the triple bond, then we could have two different products: one with NH2 at C1 and another at C6.

But wait, in the starting material, the D is at C2. So when the NH2 group is added at C1, the structure would be 1-amino-2-deutero benzene. If added at C6, it would be 6-amino-2-deutero benzene.

But are these two structures different? Because the numbering could make them different.

Wait, benzene is symmetric, so the numbering could affect the outcome. For example, in 1-amino-2-d, the amino is at position 1, while in 6-amino-2-d, it's at position 6. But in benzene, position 1 and 6 are adjacent, so substituents at 1 and 6 would be in the same relative positions as substituents at adjacent positions.

Wait, but wait. When you have substituents at positions 1 and 6, that's adjacent. But in this case, the substituents are at 1 and 2 in the first product and 6 and 2 in the second product.

Wait, in the first product (NH2 at 1, D at 2), the two substituents are adjacent. In the second product (NH2 at 6, D at 2), the substituents are at positions 6 and 2, which are also adjacent. Wait, no. Because in a benzene ring, position 6 is adjacent to position 1 and position 5. So position 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3.

So, position 6 and position 2 are not adjacent. They are across from each other in a way.

Wait, no, let me visualize the benzene ring:

Positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

If the NH2 is at position 6 and D at 2, then the positions 6 and 2 are across the ring? Because from 6, the adjacent positions are 5 and 1. So position 2 is two positions away from 6 (6 → 5 → 4 → 3 → 2, that's four steps?), no, wait, no.

Wait, no. Let me count the positions between 6 and 2.

From 6, next is 5, then 4, then 3, then 2. Wait, that's four steps. So 6 and 2 are across each other, separated by three carbons.

Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring, so the opposite position is three apart. So 1 is opposite to 4, 2 opposite to 5, 3 opposite to 6.

So, in the first product, NH2 at 1 and D at 2: substituents are adjacent.

In the second product, NH2 at 6 and D at 2: substituents are across from each other (since 2 is opposite to 5, and 6 is adjacent to 5. So 6 and 2 are not directly opposite).

Wait, no, 6 is opposite to 3, and 2 is opposite to 5. So 6 and 2 are two positions away from each other, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of the ring structure.

If the triple bond is between positions 1 and 6, then attacking at 1 would place the NH2 at 1, and the D is at 2. So the substituents are at 1 and 2.

Attacking at 6 would place NH2 at 6, and D remains at 2. So substituents are at 2 and 6.

But in the benzene ring, positions 2 and 6 are two positions away from each other (positions 2,3,4,5,6?), no, wait, position 2 is next to 1 and 3. Position 6 is next to 5 and 1. So, in this case, positions 2 and 6 are across each other (since benzene is a ring, the distance is three positions apart: 2→3→4→5→6, but that's four steps. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the two products are 1-amino-2-d benzene and 6-amino-2-d benzene. Are these two different structures? Because the positions are different.

But wait, benzene is symmetric, so substituents at 1 and 2 would be equivalent to substituents at 2 and 3, etc., depending on the numbering. But in this case, since the D is fixed at position 2, the numbering is fixed.

So, when NH2 is at position 1, the substituents are at 1 and 2.

When NH2 is at position 6, substituents are at 2 and 6.

But in benzene, the arrangement of substituents matters for the structure. So 1-amino-2-d is different from 6-amino-2-d because the amino group is at a different position relative to the D.

Thus, two distinct products would form.

Wait, but another possibility is that the reaction leads to only a single product because the attack is equally likely at either end, and the products are the same due to symmetry. But earlier I thought the starting material isn't symmetric because of the D in position 2.

So, the two products would be structurally different.

So, with that, the reaction could produce two different products.

Wait, but wait. Could there be more than two products?

Another possibility: the elimination could also occur from a different position. But earlier, I thought that the only available ortho H is at position 6, so elimination would only occur there. So the benzyne structure is fixed as between 1 and 6.

But another possibility is that the base abstracts a proton from the para position, position 4, leading to a different elimination. But in that case, the Br is at 1, and the abstracted H is at 4, which is para. So elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 4?

Wait, but in benzene, positions 1 and 4 are para, so elimination would form a triple bond between those, but that would require Br at 1 and H at 4 to be adjacent, which they are not. So the H at 4 is not adjacent to Br, so elimination can't happen there. So the only possible elimination is from position 6.

So, the benzyne is formed between positions 1 and 6, and the only possible attack sites are those two positions for the amide ion.

Therefore, the reaction would produce two different products: 1-amino-2-d benzene and 6-amino-2-d benzene.

Wait, but would both be formed? Or is there some regiochemical preference?

Alternatively, perhaps the attack occurs predominantly at one position, leading to a single product. But I don't think that's the case here because the structure isn't symmetric, so both attack positions would lead to different products.

So, the total number of possible organic products is two.

But wait, another possibility: when the benzyne is formed, perhaps it can undergo a [2+2] cycloaddition with another molecule, forming a dimer. But the question is about the products formed, so if that's the case, would that be an additional product?

Wait, the question doesn't specify whether it's considering dimerization products or not. But the options given are 1, 2, 3, or 4. If the reaction could produce two products from the addition of amide ions, plus a dimer, that would be three products. But I'm not sure if dimerization is a significant pathway here.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne could also undergo some rearrangement, but I'm not familiar with such a pathway.

Wait, going back to the original reaction. The reaction of bromobenzene with NaNH2 in liquid NH3 is a classic method to form benzene rings with substituents. But in this case, we have a deuterium in the adjacent position.

Wait, another angle: when the benzyne forms, perhaps it can react with another equivalent of NaNH2, but I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed further, and the only product is the benzyne itself. But that's unlikely because the solvent and conditions are such that the benzyne would react quickly.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne doesn't form and instead undergoes a different reaction, but that's contrary to what I know.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of products based on the possible sites of attack.

If the amide ion can attack either end of the triple bond, and each attack leads to a different product, then there would be two products.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a possibility of the triple bond opening in a way that forms a diradical, which could lead to different products. But I'm not familiar with that.

So, after considering all this, I think the reaction would produce two different organic products.


--- Final Answer Content ---


When 1-bromobenzene-2-d (bromobenzene with a deuterium at position 2) is treated with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia, the reaction proceeds as follows:

1. **Deprotonation and Elimination**:  
   The strong base NaNH₂ abstracts the acidic proton ortho to the bromine atom. In this case, the only available ortho proton is at position 6 (since position 2 has a deuterium). This leads to the elimination of the bromine atom (Br⁻) and the formation of a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between positions 1 and 6.

2. **Reactions of Benzyne**:  
   The benzyne intermediate is highly reactive and can react with the amide ion (NH₂⁻) present in the solution. The amide ion can attack either end of the triple bond, leading to two possible products:
   - **Attack at position 1**: Results in 1-amino-2-deutero benzene.
   - **Attack at position 6**: Results in 6-amino-2-deutero benzene.

3. **Symmetry Considerations**:  
   The starting material is not symmetric due to the deuterium at position 2. As a result, the two products (1-amino-2-deutero benzene and 6-amino-2-deutero benzene) are structurally distinct.

4. **No Additional Products**:  
   The reaction conditions and the nature of the benzyne intermediate do not suggest the formation of additional products, such as dimers or rearranged compounds.

Thus, the reaction produces two distinct organic products.

**Answer: C**
