Okay, so I've got this question about a rhombohedral crystal, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says: We have a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom. The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. We need to find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane.

Hmm, interplanar distance. Oh right, that's the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I remember there's a formula for that using the Miller indices and the lattice parameters.

Wait, what's a rhombohedral crystal? Oh right, it's a type of crystal structure where all the edges are of equal length, but the angles between the edges are all equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. So in this case, all angles are 30 degrees each.

I think the formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * (cos α + cos β + cos γ)/ (1 - cos α cos β cos γ) ) ). Wait, no, maybe that's more complicated. Or was it a different formula?

Alternatively, I remember the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (h k + h l + k l) * (cos θ) ), but wait, that might be for a cubic system. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing it up with something else.

Wait, I think for a general orthorhombic or rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance formula is a bit more involved. Let me think. Oh right, the general formula for a crystal system with lattice parameters a, b, c, and angles α, β, γ is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h²/(a²) + k²/(b²) + l²/(c²)) + (2 hk cos γ)/(a b) + (2 hl cos β)/(a c) + (2 kl cos α)/(b c) ) )

But wait, in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c. Oh right, because it's a special case where all edges are equal. So a = b = c = 10 Angstrom here, and all angles are 30 degrees.

So substituting into the formula, since a=b=c= a, we can simplify.

So the formula becomes:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²)/a² + (2 hk cos γ)/(a²) + (2 hl cos β)/(a²) + (2 kl cos α)/(a²) )

Wait, but all angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. So cos α = cos 30 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So, let's plug in the values for the (111) plane. h=1, k=1, l=1.

So substituting:

d = 1 / sqrt( (1 + 1 + 1)/a² + [2*(1*1) * cos30 + 2*(1*1)*cos30 + 2*(1*1)*cos30 ] / a² )

Wait, let me compute each term step by step.

First, the (h² +k² + l²) term: 1+1+1=3.

Then the other terms: each of the three cross terms is 2*1*1*cos30. So each is 2*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3). There are three such terms, so sum is 3*sqrt(3).

So putting it together, the denominator inside the sqrt is:

(3 + 3*sqrt(3)) / a².

But wait, wait. Let me check again. The formula in the denominator is (h² + k² + l²) + 2hk cos γ + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos α.

Since all angles are 30 degrees, each cosine term is cos30. So each cross term is 2 hk cos30.

So for (1,1,1):

The entire term becomes 3 + (2*1*1*sqrt(3)/2 + 2*1*1*sqrt(3)/2 + 2*1*1*sqrt(3)/2).

Wait, 2hk cos α: but wait, for each cross term, the angle is between different axes. So for hk, the angle is gamma; for hl, it's beta; for kl, it's alpha. But in this case, all angles are 30, so each cos term is same.

So, 2*1*1*cos30 for each of the three cross terms.

So each term is 2*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3). So three terms would be 3*sqrt(3).

So the total term in the denominator inside the sqrt is (3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

So the denominator is sqrt( (3 + 3√3) / a² ) ) ?

Wait, no. Wait, the denominator is sqrt( [ (h² +k² +l²) + 2hk cos γ + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos α ] / a² )

Wait, so that's sqrt( (3 + 3*sqrt(3)) ) / a.

Because the denominator of the entire expression is sqrt( sum / a² ), which is sqrt(sum)/a.

So sum is 3 + 3*sqrt(3) = 3 (1 + sqrt(3)).

So sqrt( sum ) is sqrt(3(1+sqrt(3))) ) = sqrt(3) * sqrt(1 + sqrt(3)).

So putting it all together, d = 1 / [ sqrt(3 (1 + sqrt(3)) ) / a ] )

Wait, no, wait. Because a is 10 Angstrom. So a = 10.

Wait, let me write the expression again.

d = 1 / [ sqrt( (3 + 3√3) ) / a ]

So that's a / sqrt(3 + 3√3) )

Factor out 3 in the denominator:

d = a / sqrt(3(1 + sqrt(3)) )

Which can be rewritten as a / [ sqrt(3) * sqrt(1 + sqrt(3)) ) ]

Alternatively, perhaps we can rationalize or compute numerically.

Let me compute the denominator step by step numerically.

Compute 3 + 3*sqrt(3):

3 + 3 * 1.73205 ≈ 3 + 5.19615 ≈ 8.19615.

So sqrt(8.19615) ≈ let's see, 2.863? Because 2.86 squared is about 8.18 (since 2.86^2 = 8.1796). So approximately 2.863.

So denominator is sqrt(8.19615) ≈ 2.863.

So d = a / 2.863.

a is 10, so 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.491? Wait, that can't be right. Because the options are around 9.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the formula. Because in the general formula, I think I might have flipped something.

Wait, let me double-check the formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral lattice.

Another approach: the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system can be written as:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * cos θ )

Wait, is that right? I'm a bit confused now, but let's see.

Wait, another source I recall, perhaps for a rhombohedral system with a = b = c = a, and all angles same, θ, the formula simplifies.

The formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

Wait, because in the general case of a rhombohedral structure, the expression for the interplanar distance could be written as:

d = 1 / sqrt( [ (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos θ ] / (a²) )

Since a = b = c.

So then, d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

Wait, but for the (111) plane, h=k=l=1.

So substituting, numerator is a=10.

Denominator is sqrt( (3) - (3) * cos θ ), since (1*1 +1*1 +1*1) =3.

Wait, theta is 30 degrees. So cos theta is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 3*(sqrt(3)/2)).

Compute inside the square root:

3 - (3 sqrt(3)/2 ) = 3 [1 - (sqrt(3)/2) ]

Hmm, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866.

So 1 - 0.866 = 0.134.

Multiply by 3: 0.402.

So sqrt(0.402) ≈ 0.634.

So d = 10 / 0.634 ≈ 15.77 Angstrom? But wait, the options are all around 9, so that's way higher. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, I think I got the formula wrong. Because earlier when I considered the general formula, I had a different denominator. Maybe I need to revisit the correct formula.

Alternative approach: The correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral lattice is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) * cos θ ) )

But wait, another thought: I think in the case of a rhombohedral lattice, the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (h k + h l + k l) cos θ )

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's think about when θ = 60 degrees. Then cosθ = 0.5.

So for (111), the denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 3*(0.5)) = sqrt(3 -1.5) = sqrt(1.5) ≈1.2247. So d = a/(1.2247) ≈ 8.165 Angstrom if a=10.

Which would be about 8.16, which is close to option B (8.95), but not exactly. Hmm.

Wait, but in our case, theta is 30 degrees. So cos theta is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So for (111), denominator would be sqrt(3 - 3*(sqrt(3)/2)).

Compute inside the square root:

3 - (3*(sqrt(3)/2)) = 3 [1 - (sqrt(3)/2) ]

sqrt(3) ≈1.732, so sqrt(3)/2≈0.866.

1 - 0.866 ≈0.134.

Multiply by 3: 0.402.

So denominator is sqrt(0.402) ≈0.634.

So d=10 / 0.634≈15.77 Angstrom. But that's way larger than the given options. That can't be right.

Wait, that makes me think I have the formula wrong. Because if the interplanar distance is larger than the interatomic distance, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, but the interplanar distance is the spacing between layers, which could be larger or smaller depending on the structure.

Wait, but maybe I have the formula inverted. Let me think again. Maybe the formula is sqrt( [ (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ] ) / a.

Wait, no, the formula I think I'm missing a sign.

Wait, another approach: The formula I should use is derived from the Miller indices and lattice parameters. For a general rhombohedral system, the interplanar spacing is given by:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Wait, perhaps I should double-check a reference. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( [ (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ] )

Wait, but that would change the calculation. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula. For a rhombohedral system, the correct interplanar distance formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let me think about the case where theta=60 degrees again. If theta=60, cos(theta)=0.5. For (100) plane, hkl=1,0,0:

d= a / sqrt(1 - 0 )= a/1 = a.

Which is correct for a face-centered cubic (but wait, rhombohedral includes cubic when angles are 90.)

Wait, another thought. Maybe I should use the formula for a rhombohedral system as:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) + ...something else? Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use another formula involving the reciprocal lattice.

Wait, another approach: The reciprocal lattice vectors in a rhombohedral system. The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (1/a) (1,1,1) / sin(30) ?

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the reciprocal lattice parameters can be used, but perhaps that's more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute using the metric tensor.

The metric tensor g for a rhombohedral lattice is a 3x3 matrix where the diagonal elements are a², and the off-diagonal elements are a² cos(theta), where theta is 30 degrees.

So the metric tensor g is:

[ a²       a² cos θ    a² cos θ ]
[ a² cos θ  a²        a² cos θ ]
[ a² cos θ a² cos θ   a²        ]

The interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by 1 / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) cosθ ), but I might be mixing up the terms.

Wait, the formula for the reciprocal of d^2 is (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) multiplied by the sum of certain terms. But perhaps I should compute it using the metric tensor.

The formula for 1/d² is (h² + k² + l²) - (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α ), but in a rhombohedral system, all angles are the same, so it's (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta).

Wait, wait, but cos(alpha) is cos(theta), so the formula for 1/d² is (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta).

So in this case, for (111):

1/d² = 3 - 3 cos(30°).

So cos(30) is about 0.866.

So 3 - 3*0.866 = 3 - 2.598 = 0.402.

So 1/d² = 0.402.

So d² = 1/0.402 ≈ 2.4875.

d = sqrt(2.4875) ≈ 1.577.

Wait, but that would make d ≈1.577 Angstrom. But the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. That can't be right because the interplanar distance should be smaller than the interatomic distance? No, wait, that's not necessarily true. Because the interplanar distance is the spacing between planes, which can be larger or smaller depending on the planes.

But wait, the interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice. The interplanar distance is the spacing between planes, which is determined by the Miller indices.

Wait, but in this calculation, I'm getting d ≈1.577 Angstrom, which is way smaller than the options given (which are around ~9 Angstrom). So something is definitely wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to include the a² in the denominator. Let me re-express the formula correctly.

The correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ) * (a / something? )

Wait, no. Let me rederive it.

The formula for the interplanar distance comes from the reciprocal of the plane's normal vector in the reciprocal space. Alternatively, the interplanar distance d is given by:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ) * (a / ... )

Wait, perhaps I should use the relation involving the volume of the unit cell.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Wait, but in that case, for a cubic system (all angles 90, cos(theta)=0), d would be a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²), which is correct.

In our case, for (111), h=k=l=1.

So, 1/d² = (3 - 3 * cos(theta)) / a².

Wait, let me think: perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ) ) * (1/a)

Wait, that would make more sense. Because for cubic, with theta=90, cos(theta)=0, so d = 1/(sqrt(h² +k² +l²)/a ) ) = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²), which is correct.

So yes, the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ) ) * (1/a)

Wait, no. Wait, that can't be, because then d would be 1/something, which would be 1/(sqrt(3 - 3*sqrt(3)/2 )) * (1/10) ), which is very small. Which doesn't make sense.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of another approach.

In a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

But when I plug in the numbers, it's giving me a value of about 15.77, which is larger than the interatomic distance. Is that possible?

Wait, another thought: If the crystal structure is rhombohedral with a=10 Angstrom and angles of 30 degrees, the (111) planes are closer together than what a=10 suggests. So perhaps the interplanar distance is less than a.

Wait, let me try plugging in the numbers again.

For (111):

h =k =l=1.

So the denominator is sqrt(3 - 3 * cos(30°)) = sqrt(3 - 3*(sqrt(3)/2)).

Compute 3*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈3*0.8660 ≈2.598.

So 3 -2.598 =0.402.

sqrt(0.402) ≈0.634.

So d = a / 0.634 ≈10 /0.634 ≈15.77 Angstrom.

But the options are around 9. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let's think about the volume of the unit cell.

The volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2(theta) + 2 cos^3(theta)).

Wait, but I'm not sure how that helps directly. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for d_{hkl} is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which we've already tried, but gives a much larger d than the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which would change the denominator.

Let me try that.

For (111):

Denominator: sqrt(3 + 3 * cos(theta)).

cos(theta)=sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So 3 +3 *0.866=3 +2.598=5.598.

sqrt(5.598)= approximately 2.366.

So d=10 /2.366≈4.226 Angstrom. Still doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula has a minus sign, but perhaps I should think about the relationship between the reciprocal lattice and the planes.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the structure factor or another method.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal, which is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

But this gives 15.77 Angstrom, which isn't matching. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reciprocal vectors. Because in the reciprocal lattice, the vectors are given by:

b1 = (1,1,1) / (a sin(30°)) )

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the reciprocal basis vectors are:

b1 = (1/a) (1,1,1) / (sin(60°))

Wait, maybe not. Another approach: The reciprocal lattice vectors in a rhombohedral system are given by:

b1 = (1,1,1)/ (a sin α )

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, I'm getting stuck here, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the unit cell volume and then use it to find d.

The volume V of a rhombohedral cell is a^3 * (1 - 3 cos^2(alpha) + 2 cos^3(alpha)) )^(1/2).

Wait, perhaps the formula is V = a^3 sqrt( 1 - 3 cos^2 θ + 2 cos^3 θ )

So with a=10 Angstrom, theta=30 degrees.

So compute V:

cos^2(theta) = (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4.

cos^3(theta)= (sqrt(3)/2)^3 = 3*sqrt(3)/8 ≈0.6495.

So,

1 -3*(3/4) +2*(3√3/8 )

Compute each term:

1 =1.

3*(3/4)=9/4=2.25 → 1-2.25= -1.25.

2*(3√3/8)= (3√3)/4 ≈ (5.196)/4≈1.299.

So sum is (-1.25) + (1.299) ≈0.049.

So sqrt(0.049)≈0.221.

So V=10^3 * 0.221=1000 *0.221=221 Angstrom^3.

Hmm, but how does that help me with the interplanar distance?

Ah, perhaps using the relation:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Wait, but I think that's what I did earlier, leading to d=15.77.

But that doesn't match the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula should be:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

In that case, for (111):

Denominator becomes sqrt(3 +3*0.866)=sqrt(5.598)= ~2.366.

d=10/2.366≈4.226 Angstrom.

But that's still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I should try using the reciprocal formula.

Wait, the formula for the reciprocal distance is 1/d^2 = (h² +k² +l²)/(a²) - ( hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α )/( a^2 )

In our case, all cosines are same, so 1/d^2 = [3 + 3 cos(theta)] / a².

Wait, no, wait: 1/d^2 = (h² +k² +l²)/(a²) - [ hk cosγ + hl cosβ + kl cosα ]/(a² )

Which simplifies to [ (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ] / a².

So 1/d^2 = [3 - 3*(sqrt(3)/2) ] / 10².

Compute numerator: 3 - (3*sqrt(3)/2 ) ≈3 - 2.598≈0.402.

So 1/d^2 = 0.402 /100 → 0.00402.

So d^2=1/0.00402≈248.756.

d= sqrt(248.756)≈15.77 Angstrom.

Again, same value as before, and again, not matching the options.

Hmm, why am I getting such a high value? The options are all around 9 Angstrom.

Maybe the formula is different. Another possibility: perhaps the formula for d is a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ), but where theta is not 30 degrees but 60 degrees. Wait, no, the question says all angles are 30 degrees.

Wait, perhaps I've misapplied the formula because in a rhombohedral system, the angles in the formula are the angles between the reciprocal lattice vectors, not the original ones. No, that can't be it. The formula uses the angles between the original lattice vectors.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should use the formula for the interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell's volume.

The formula is:

d_{hkl} = (V)^(1/3) / ( sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ) )

Wait, no, I don't think that's correct. Because in simple cubic, V = a^3, and the formula for d is a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²), which would give d = (V^(1/3)) / sqrt(h² +k² +l²).

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which again gives the same 15.77.

Wait, perhaps I should try to calculate using the metric tensor.

The metric tensor g is given by:

g = [ [ a², a² cosθ, a² cosθ ],
       [ a² cosθ, a², a² cosθ ],
       [ a² cosθ, a² cosθ, a² ] ]

The reciprocal metric tensor g^-1 is needed to compute the interplanar distance.

The formula for interplanar distance is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( h² g11 + k² g22 + l² g33 + 2 h k g12 + 2 h l g13 + 2 k l g23 )

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h g1 + k g2 + l g3)^2 + (h g2 + k g3 + l g1)^2 + (h g3 + k g1 + l g2)^2 ) )

No, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the metric tensor. The reciprocal metric tensor g^{-1} has elements:

g^{-1}_ij = (1/(a² ( 1 - 3 cos^2θ + 2 cos^3θ ))) * [ (1 - cos^2θ), ( - cosθ ), ( - cosθ ) ]

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, the reciprocal metric tensor g^{-1} is given by:

g^{-1} = (1/(a²)) * [ [ 1, cosθ, cosθ ],
                      [ cosθ, 1, cosθ ],
                      [ cosθ, cosθ, 1 ] ]^{-1}

But inverting this matrix is a bit involved.

Let me compute the determinant of the matrix inside.

The matrix M is:

[ 1   cosθ   cosθ ]
[ cosθ 1   cosθ ]
[ cosθ cosθ 1 ]

Compute determinant:

det(M) = 1*(1*1 - cosθ * cosθ) - cosθ*(cosθ*1 - cosθ * cosθ) + cosθ*(cosθ * cosθ - 1 * cosθ )

= 1*(1 - cos²θ) - cosθ*(cosθ - cos²θ) + cosθ*(cos²θ - cosθ )

= (1 - cos²θ) - cosθ * cosθ (1 - cosθ ) + cosθ ( cos²θ - cosθ )

= (1 - cos²θ) - cos²θ (1 - cosθ ) + cosθ ( cosθ (cosθ - 1) )

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute numerically.

Let θ =30°, so cosθ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So M becomes:

1    0.866  0.866

0.866 1      0.866

0.866 0.866 1

Compute determinant:

= 1*(1*1 - 0.866^2) - 0.866*(0.866*1 - 0.866*0.866) + 0.866*(0.866^2 - 1*0.866)

Compute each term:

First term: 1*(1 - 0.75) = 0.25.

Second term: -0.866 * (0.866 - 0.75) = -0.866*(0.116)≈-0.0999.

Third term: 0.866*(0.75 - 0.866)=0.866*(-0.116)≈-0.0999.

So sum: 0.25 -0.0999 -0.0999 ≈0.25-0.1998≈0.0502.

So det(M) ≈0.0502.

The inverse of M is (1/det(M)) * adjugate(M).

But perhaps the inverse is given by:

(1/det(M)) * [ [ 1, -cosθ, -cosθ ],
               [ -cosθ, 1, -cosθ ],
               [ -cosθ, -cosθ, 1 ] ]

Wait, no, perhaps not. Alternatively, the inverse of M is:

(1/(1 - 3 cos²θ + 2 cos^3θ )) * [ [ (1 - cos²θ), -cosθ, -cosθ ],
                                    [ -cosθ, (1 - cos²θ), -cosθ ],
                                    [ -cosθ, -cosθ, (1 - cos²θ) ] ]

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the inverse is:

[ [ (1 - cos²θ), -cosθ, -cosθ ],
  [ -cosθ, (1 - cos²θ), -cosθ ],
  [ -cosθ, -cosθ, (1 - cos²θ) ] ] / det(M)

But since I'm getting stuck, perhaps I should proceed numerically.

Compute the inverse of M:

M = [[1, 0.866, 0.866],
     [0.866, 1, 0.866],
     [0.866, 0.866, 1]]

Compute the inverse matrix.

The inverse, M^{-1}, is (1/det(M)) * adjugate(M).

Adjugate M is the transpose of the cofactor matrix.

Cofactor of element (1,1):

+ determinant of minor [[1, 0.866], [0.866, 1]] = (1)(1) - (0.866)^2 = 1 - 0.75=0.25.

So cofactor(1,1)=0.25.

Similarly, cofactor(1,2):

- determinant of minor [[0.866, 0.866], [0.866, 1]] = 0.866*1 - 0.866*0.866 = 0.866 - 0.75 = 0.116.

So cofactor(1,2) = -0.116.

Similarly, cofactor(1,3)= - determinant of minor [[0.866,1], [0.866,0.866]] = -(0.866*0.866 - 1*0.866 )= -(0.75 - 0.866 )= -(-0.116)=0.116.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Perhaps a better approach is to use a matrix inversion formula.

But perhaps for time's sake, I'll just note that the reciprocal metric tensor g^{-1} is given by (1/a²) * M^{-1}.

Once I have g^{-1}, the interplanar distance is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( h² g^{-1}_11 + k² g^{-1}_22 + l² g^{-1}_33 + 2 h k g^{-1}_12 + 2 h l g^{-1}_13 + 2 k l g^{-1}_23 )

But we can compute it as:

d_{hkl} = sqrt( (g^{-1}_11 h² + g^{-1}_22 k² + g^{-1}_33 l² + 2 g^{-1}_12 hk + 2 g^{-1}_13 hl + 2 g^{-1}_23 kl )^{-1} )

But I'm not sure of the exact values of g^{-1} elements. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute them numerically.

But maybe I should try to proceed with the formula I have, even though the answer doesn't match the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct answer is indeed around 15.77, which is not among the options.

But the options are all around 9, so perhaps I should re-examine the problem.

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm using is for a hexagonal system, not rhombohedral. Alternatively, perhaps the question is misworded and refers to a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, which is a special case of rhombohedral with angles 60 degrees.

Wait, but the question clearly states rhombohedral with angles 30 degrees.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach. Let's consider that the interplanar distance is given by the formula:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - hk - hl - kl )

But that would be the case for a hexagonal system perhaps. Let me try.

For (111):

d =10 / sqrt(3 -3) = 10/0 → undefined. Not possible.

No, that can't be it.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) )

Which would give sqrt(3 -3 )=0 → division by zero. So that can't be.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 9.08

B)8.95

C)9.54

D)10.05

These are all close to 9.5. So perhaps the correct answer is 9.54 (option C), but I'm not sure.

Wait, but why would the calculation give 15? I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which would give:

Denominator sqrt(3 +3 *0.866 )=sqrt(5.598)= ~2.366.

d=10/2.366≈4.226 Angstrom → no.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) )

But that would give sqrt(3-3)=0 → division by zero.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the structure factor, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice is also rhombohedral, and the interplanar spacing is determined by the reciprocal vectors. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * cos(theta) )

But perhaps the angle in the formula is different, like 180 - theta, but that would make cos(theta) negative.

Wait, let me try that.

cos(150 degrees) = -sqrt(3)/2 ≈-0.866.

Then,

d =10 / sqrt(3 -3*(-0.866))=10/sqrt(3+2.598)=10/sqrt(5.598)=10/2.366≈4.226. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses 2 theta? No, that seems unlikely.

Another Idea: Maybe I should calculate the length of the vector (h, k, l) in reciprocal space, then invert it.

In reciprocal space, the vector is (h, k, l) scaled by factors involving the angles.

Wait, the interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector.

The reciprocal lattice vector components are given by:

u = h / (a sin(theta)) 

v = k / (a sin(theta)) 

w = l / (a sin(theta)) 

Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, the reciprocal vectors are defined such that:

b1 = (1/a) (1,1,1) / (sin(theta)) )

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, I'm getting stuck and perhaps should consider that the correct answer is option C) 9.54 Angstrom, based on another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the angle between the planes and use that to find the spacing.

But I'm not sure.

Another Idea: Perhaps I should compute using the formula d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Wait, but let's compute it again.

h=k=l=1.

d =10 / sqrt(3 -3 * cos(30)).

cos(30)=√3/2≈0.866.

So 3 *0.866=2.598.

3 -2.598=0.402.

sqrt(0.402)=0.634.

d=10/0.634≈15.77 Angstrom.

Hmm. But this isn't matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which gives:

sqrt(3 +3 *0.866)=sqrt(5.598)=2.366.

d=10/2.366≈4.226.

But that's still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

But that would give d=10 * sqrt(0.402)=10*0.634≈6.34 Angstrom.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which gives 4.226 Angstrom.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which would make:

3 - 2*3 *0.866=3 -5.196= -2.196.

Which is negative, so sqrt not possible. So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * [ (3 cos(theta) ) / (1 - cos(theta)) ] )

But I don't know where that formula comes from.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * (1 - cos(theta)) )

Which for (111) would be:

3 -3*(1 - 0.866)=3 -3*(0.134)=3-0.402=2.598.

d=10/sqrt(2.598)=10/1.612≈6.199 Angstrom.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses a different combination.

I'm clearly stuck here. Perhaps the correct answer is option C)9.54 Angstrom, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an alternative formula.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system is given by:

d_{hkl} = (a ) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) * cos(theta) )

But in this case, the denominator is sqrt(3 -3*(sqrt(3)/2 ))=sqrt(0.402)=0.634.

So d=10/0.634≈15.77.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another Idea: Maybe the formula should be:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * cos(theta) )

But a is the lattice parameter, which is the interatomic distance. So perhaps in this case, the interatomic distance is the edge length a, which is given as 10 Angstrom.

So with a=10, the d for (111) is 15.77, which is not among the options. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = (a ) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which would give d=4.226, but again, not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = (a ) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which for (111):

Denominator sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2 ))=sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

Compute 3*sqrt(3) ≈5.196.

So 3+5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=~2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.491 Angstrom.

Still not matching.

Hmm. I've tried all possible variations, and none give an answer close to the options provided. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing a key concept here.

Wait, another Idea: Perhaps the given interatomic distance is not the lattice parameter a, but the nearest neighbor distance. In a rhombohedral system, the nearest neighbor distance is along the edges, which have length a. So a is 10 Angstrom.

Thus, the earlier calculation of d=15.77 is correct, but it's not in the options. Therefore, perhaps the question has a mistake, or I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are in a different configuration. For a rhombohedral system, sometimes the acute and obtuse angles are considered. If the given angles are the obtuse angles (150 degrees), then cos(theta)= cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2 ≈-0.866.

Plug that into the formula:

d =10 / sqrt(3 -3*(-0.866))=10/sqrt(3+2.598)=10/sqrt(5.598)=10/2.366≈4.226 Angstrom.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * (1 - cos(theta)) )

Which would mean:

3 -3*(1 -0.866)=3 -3*(0.134)=3-0.402≈2.598.

d=10/sqrt(2.598)=10/1.612≈6.199 Angstrom.

Still not matching options.

I'm stuck. I think I've tried all possible variations, and none give the options provided. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ) * sqrt(1 - cos(theta)).

Wait, that would be:

sqrt(0.402) * sqrt(1 -0.866 )=0.634 * sqrt(0.134)=0.634*0.366≈0.231.

d =10/0.231≈43.29 Angstrom. No, that's way too big.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ) * (1 - cos(theta)) )

Which is:

0.402 * (1 -0.866 )=0.402 * 0.134=0.0538.

d=10 / sqrt(0.0538 )=10/0.232≈43.1 Angstrom. No.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * (1 - cos(theta)) )

Which for (111):

3 -3*(1 -0.866)=3 -3*0.134=3-0.402=2.598.

d=10/sqrt(2.598)=10/1.612≈6.199 Angstrom.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is the reciprocal of what I've been using. Let me try:

d_{hkl} = sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ) / a.

Which would give:

sqrt(3 -3*(0.866 ))=sqrt(0.402)=0.634.

d=0.634/10=0.0634 Angstrom. No.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula entirely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is easier if I consider the structure as a face-centered cubic (FCC), which is a special case of rhombohedral with angles of 60 degrees. Let's see what happens.

In FCC, a=10, theta=60 degrees.

For (111):

d= a / sqrt(3 - 3*(0.5))=10/sqrt(3-1.5)=10/sqrt(1.5)=10/1.2247≈8.165 Angstrom.

Which is close to option B (8.95) and option A (9.08), but not exact.

But in our problem, the angles are 30 degrees, not 60.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest option is C)9.54.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which gives d=4.226, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which would give d=10 * sqrt(0.402)=10 *0.634≈6.34 Angstrom.

No, that's not matching options.

I'm really stuck here. Perhaps the correct answer is option C)9.54 Angstrom. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which would give:

3 -2*3*0.866=3 -5.196= -2.196 → negative, so no.

Hmm.

Okay, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option C)9.54 Angstrom, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which gives 15.77, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another Idea: Perhaps the angles given are the angles between the reciprocal lattice vectors, not the original ones. If that's the case, then cos(theta) would be negative.

So for theta=30 degrees in reciprocal lattice, cos(theta)= cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2.

So the formula becomes:

d =10 / sqrt(3 -3*(-0.866))=10/sqrt(5.598)=10/2.366≈4.226.

No, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the supplementary angle, 180-30=150, so cos(theta)= -0.866.

So,

d =10/sqrt(3 -3*(-0.866))=10/sqrt(3+2.598)=10/sqrt(5.598)=10/2.366≈4.226.

Still not matching.

I think I'm stuck and can't find the correct formula to match the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which gives 15.77, but that's not among the options. So perhaps the question has an error. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance can be found using the formula for a simple cubic system, but adjusted for the angles.

In simple cubic, d= a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² )

But with the angles taken into account, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which again leads to 15.77.

Thus, I'm confident that the correct answer should be approximately 15.77 Angstrom, but since it's not among the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C)9.54 Angstrom, but I don't know why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option B)8.95 Angstrom.

But wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which for (111):

3 + 6*(0.866)=3+5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.491 Angstrom.

No, that's not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a * (1 - cos(theta)) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) )

Which gives:

(10) * (1-0.866)/sqrt(3-3)= (1.34)/0 → undefined.

No, that can't be.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities and can't find a way to get an answer matching the options. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option C)9.54 Angstrom, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier and the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d_{hkl} \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) \cos(\theta)}}
\]

### Step 1: Substituting the values
For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \), and \( \cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \). Substituting these into the formula:

\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3 - 3 \cdot 0.866}}
\]

### Step 2: Simplifying the denominator
\[
3 - 3 \cdot 0.866 = 3 - 2.598 = 0.402
\]
\[
\sqrt{0.402} \approx 0.634
\]

### Step 3: Calculating \( d_{111} \)
\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{0.634} \approx 15.77 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Step 4: Analyzing the discrepancy
The calculated value of \( d_{111} \approx 15.77 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the provided options, which are all around 9–10 Å. This suggests either a mistake in the formula application or an issue with the interpretation of the problem. Several alternative approaches were considered, including variations of the formula and adjustments for supplementary angles, but none yielded a result close to the given options.

### Step 5: Selecting the closest option
Given the mismatch between the calculated value and the options, the most reasonable choice based on the provided options is **C) 9.54 Å**, as it is the closest to the expected range for interplanar distances in such a crystal system.

ANSWER: C
