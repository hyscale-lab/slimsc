Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

The question says that there's a state |alpha> describing an electron. It's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh right, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, first things first, I should normalize this state because the question says it's proportional, not necessarily normalized.

Wait, right. To normalize, I need to find the norm of the vector. The norm squared is the sum of the absolute squares of the coefficients. So the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i).

Calculating the absolute square for each:
- |1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, since the real and imaginary parts are both 1. So 1^2 + 1^2 = 2.
Wait, no, wait. The correct formula is |a + bi|^2 = a² + b². So (1+i) is 1² + 1² = 2. And (2 -i) is |2|² + |-1|² = 4 +1 =5.

So the norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ].

Now the question is about calculating the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The operator's matrix is given as A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, that's a 2x2 matrix because it's for spin-1/2 systems, I think.

So let's write out the matrix A. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, the indices i and j can be 1 and 2. When i≠j, A_ij is ħ/2. If i=j, it's 0. So the matrix looks like:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait a second, that's a spin operator? Oh wait, no, that's a different operator. Let me think. Because the standard Pauli matrices have 1s on the off-diagonal, but this matrix is scaled with ħ/2. Oh wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and the spin operator S_x is (ħ/2) times that. So yeah, this operator A is actually the spin-x operator, S_x.

But wait, the problem says to find the eigenstates of this operator. So the operator is S_x, whose eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. So the question is, when we measure the spin in the x-direction, what's the probability of getting each eigenvalue (i.e., +ħ/2 and -ħ/2), and what's the average value of the operator A.

But wait, the operator A is S_x, right? So the average value would be the expectation value of S_x in the state |alpha>.

So I need to find two things: the expansion of |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A (which are |+x> and |-x>), and then calculate the probabilities of each eigenstate, and the expectation value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can diagonalize the operator A, find its eigenstates, and express |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates. The probabilities would then be the square of the coefficients' magnitudes.

So let's proceed. First, let's find the eigenstates of A.

The matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. Let's find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(A - λ I) = 0. So,

| -λ    ħ/2 |
| ħ/2   -λ |  = 0

The determinant is λ^2 - (ħ²/4) = 0 → λ² = ħ²/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, as expected.

Now the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

For λ = +ħ/2:

(A - λ I) v = 0 → 
[ [ -ħ/2 , ħ/2 ] 
  [ ħ/2 , -ħ/2 ] ]

So the equations are:
-ħ/2 v1 + ħ/2 v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvectors are of the form [v1, v1]^T. We can normalize them. Let's set v1=1, so the vector is (1,1)^T. The length is sqrt(1² +1²) = sqrt(2). So the unit eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, but actually, if I take the standard eigenstates for S_x, they are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2), right? So wait, actually, in terms of the eigenstates, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) multiplied by some phase. Let me check: the eigenstates of S_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for +ħ/2 and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) for -ħ/2.

Wait, no, actually, the eigenstates for S_x are |+x> = (|↑> + |↓>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|↑> − |↓>)/sqrt(2), right? Because when you apply S_x to |+x>, you get +ħ/2 |+x> — yes, that's correct.

So the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me check that. Alternatively, maybe it's (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), but I might have to check the signs. Either way, I can proceed.

So the next step is to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

First, let me write |alpha> in terms of |up> and |down>.

|alpha> = [1/sqrt(7)] [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

Wait, no: the state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>, so after normalization, it's (1/sqrt(7)) multiplied by that.

So |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ]

Now we can express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

We have:

|+x> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> + |down> )

|-x> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> − |down> )

So any state can be written as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the expansion coefficients by taking the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and |-x>.

So let's compute the inner products.

First, compute c_+x = < +x | alpha >.

c_+x = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 −i)|down> ]

Which simplifies to:

(1/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2−i) <down|up> + ... ]

But wait, the inner product <up|down> is zero, and same for <down|up>, so actually, it's:

= (1/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) * 1 + (2 - i)*0 ]

Wait, no. Wait, more carefully:

<+x|alpha> = [ <up| + <down| ] / sqrt(2) * (1/sqrt(7)) ( (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> )

Each term:

- (1+i) <up| up> = (1+i) *1
- (1+i) <up| down> = 0
- (2−i) <down| up> =0
- (2−i) <down| down> = (2−i)*1

So the sum is (1+i) + (2 −i) = 3.

So c_+x = (3) / (sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, compute c_-x = < -x | alpha >.

| -x > is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So < -x | alpha > = [ <up| - <down| ] / sqrt(2) * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

Again, compute each term:

(1+i) <up| up> → (1+i)*1

(1+i) <up| down> → 0

(2−i) <down| up> →0

(2−i) <down| down> → (2−i)* (-1) because <down| is conjugated?

Wait, no, the inner product <down|alpha> is the conjugate transpose. Wait, no, no, wait. Let me make it correctly. The state |alpha> is a ket, and when I take <down|alpha>, it's the coefficient of |down> in |alpha>, which is (2−i) * (1/sqrt(7)).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write the inner product as:

c_-x = [ <up| - <down| ] / sqrt(2) * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ]

So each component:

= [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2−i) <up|down> ) - ( (1+i) <down|up> + (2−i) <down|down> ) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))

But <up|down> is zero, and <down|up> is zero.

So this simplifies to:

= [ (1+i)*1 - (2−i)*1 ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))

So numerator is (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + i(1+1) )= (-1) + 2i.

So c_-x = (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7)).

Wait, let me double-check that:

c_-x = [ (1+i) *1 - (2 -i)*1 ] / (sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) )

= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(14))

= [ (1-2) + i (1 +1) ) ] / sqrt(14)

= (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)

Hmm, so c_+x is 3/sqrt(14), and c_-x is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, but I need to make sure about the signs and calculations. Let me recompute c_+x.

c_+x = [ (1+i) + (2−i) ] / (sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) )

= [ (1+2) + (i -i) ) ] / sqrt(14)

= 3 / sqrt(14)

Yes, that's correct.

Now the probabilities are |c_+x|^2 and |c_-x|^2.

Let's compute |c_+x|^2: (3/sqrt(14)) )^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Then |c_-x|^2: [ (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14) ] * [ (-1 - 2i)/sqrt(14) ] → ( ( (-1)^2 - (2i)^2 ) ) / (14) → (1 - (-4)) ) /14 → (5)/14 ≈ 0.3571. Wait, but let me compute that more carefully.

Wait, (-1 + 2i) multiplied by its conjugate (-1 -2i) is:

(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-2i) + (2i)(-1) + (2i)(-2i) → 1 + 2i -2i -4i².

i² is -1, so -4i² is 4. So 1 + 0i +4 → 5.

So |c_-x|^2 is 5/(14) ≈ 0.357.

Hmm, but the options don't seem to have 9/14 (0.6429) and 5/14 (0.357). Let me look at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 → which is close to 9/14 (≈0.6429) and 5/14 (≈0.357). So that's the first part.

Now, the average value of the operator A is the expectation value, <A>.

Which is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is the spin-x operator, S_x, the expectation value is <S_x> = <alpha| S_x |alpha>.

But another approach is to use the fact that the expectation value is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities. So <A> = (+ħ/2) * P_+x + (-ħ/2) * P_-x.

So with P_+x = 9/14 and P_-x =5/14.

So <A> = ( (9/14)*(+1/2) ) ħ + (5/14)*(-1/2) ) ħ.

Wait, no. Because the eigenvalues are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So <A> = (9/14)(+ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) )

= [ (9/14)(1/2) - (5/14)(1/2) ) ] ħ

= [ ( (9 -5) )/(28) ) ] ħ

= (4/28) ħ = (1/7) ħ.

So the average value is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.6429 and 0.3571, which are 9/14 and 5/14, and the average is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options:

Option A says probabilities 0.64, 0.36 and average ħ/7. That matches.

Wait, but let me see the options again.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Yes, 9/14 is 0.642857..., which is approximately 0.64, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.36. So Option A seems to match.

Wait, but what about option D? It has probabilities 0.61 and 0.29, which don't match. Option C has 0.28 and 0.72, which is the opposite.

So Option A must be correct. Therefore, the answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves an electron in the state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given as \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the norm squared:
\[
\| |\alpha\rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right].
\]

### Step 2: Identify the eigenstates of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) is a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is the spin-\( x \) operator \( S_x \) in quantum mechanics. Its eigenstates are the eigenstates of \( S_x \), which are:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

### Step 3: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
To find the probabilities of measuring \( |\alpha\rangle \) in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), compute the expansion coefficients:
\[
c_{+x} = \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ \langle \uparrow | + \langle \downarrow | \right] \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right].
\]
Simplifying:
\[
c_{+x} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ (1+i) + (2-i) \right] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} (3) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

Similarly, for \( c_{-x} \):
\[
c_{-x} = \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ \langle \uparrow | - \langle \downarrow | \right] \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right].
\]
Simplifying:
\[
c_{-x} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ (1+i) - (2-i) \right] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} (-1 + 2i).
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the probabilities
The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:
\[
P_{+x} = |c_{+x}|^2 = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6429,
\]
\[
P_{-x} = |c_{-x}|^2 = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{(-1)^2 + (2)^2}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571.
\]

### Step 5: Compute the average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is the expectation value:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]
Using the eigenstates of \( A \), the expectation value can also be expressed as:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \left( \frac{\hbar}{2} \right) P_{+x} + \left( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \right) P_{-x}.
\]
Substituting the probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{9}{14} - \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{5}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 6: Match with the options
The probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
