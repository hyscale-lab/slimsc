Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass in a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, so the force is F = -kx. The options are labeled A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, so in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator's maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But this is a relativistic case, so I can't use the classical formulas directly. Relativistic effects must come into play here because as the speed approaches the speed of light, the relativistic mass increases, affecting the dynamics.

In the classical scenario, the potential energy at maximum displacement A is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy at the equilibrium point (where speed is max) is the same. So the maximum speed v_classical would be sqrt(kA²/m). But that's option C, right? So maybe that's the classical answer and not the relativistic one. So the correct answer here would have to involve some relativistic correction.

Wait, but the problem is about a relativistic oscillator, so the speed shouldn't be as high as in the classical case. Or wait, no—relativistic effects usually become significant when speeds are a significant fraction of c, but the potential in the oscillator could be strong enough that the speed is a considerable fraction of c.

Let me think about relativistic energy. In special relativity, the total energy is gamma times the rest energy, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy E would be the sum of the rest energy (mc²) and the kinetic energy (which depends on velocity). But in the case of a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is conserved, so at the maximum displacement A, all the energy is potential, and at the equilibrium position (x=0), all the energy is kinetic (but relativistic, so it's more involved).

Wait, but the potential energy in a relativistic oscillator isn't the same as the classical case. Or maybe this problem is considering a relativistic correction to the oscillator's equation of motion. Hmm.

Wait, the equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator—what's that look like? In the non-relativistic case, it's F = -kx, leading to m d²x/dt² = -kx, giving the solution x(t) = A cos(ω t + φ), where ω is sqrt(k/m). The maximum speed is then ω A, which is sqrt(k/m) * A, leading to maximum speed v_max = sqrt(k A²/m) which is option C. But that's the classical, non-relativistic case.

In the relativistic case, the equation of motion is different. Oh wait, I think the relativistic harmonic oscillator's equation might involve terms with velocity. Let me recall. The force in relativity would be F = d(momentum)/dt, and momentum p = gamma m v. So F = d/dt (gamma m v) = m d/dt (gamma v).

But for a harmonic oscillator, F = -k x. So putting it together, m d²x/dt² = -k x / gamma? Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again.

The force F is d(p)/dt, and p = gamma m v. So F = d/dt (gamma m v) = m d/dt (gamma v). But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so d(gamma)/dt is [v/(1 - v²/c²)^(3/2)] * (d(v)/dt) ), which might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to consider energy. The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. At maximum displacement A, all the energy is potential, and at equilibrium (x=0), all is kinetic.

But wait, in the classical case, the potential is (1/2)k A². But in the relativistic case, maybe the potential energy is different. Hmm, but the problem statement says it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -k x. So the potential energy would be the integral of F dx, which is (1/2)k x², same as classical. So the potential energy at A is (1/2)k A².

The total energy E is then (1/2)k A². At x=0, all that energy is kinetic. So E = K + mc² (if we're considering relativistic energy, but wait, maybe not. Because in relativistic mechanics, the total energy is gamma m c², which includes rest mass energy. So if the oscillator is in motion, the total energy could be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. Wait, but in the case when the oscillator is at rest, its energy is mc². When it's moving, the total energy is gamma mc², which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I should model this correctly. The total mechanical energy of the oscillator in the relativistic case includes the rest mass energy. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement A, all the energy is potential. So E = (1/2)k A² + mc² (because the rest energy is always there). No, that doesn't make sense because in the classical case, the total energy is (1/2)k A², but in relativistic, perhaps the rest energy is part of the system's energy. Hmm, maybe I should think again.

Wait, no. The rest mass energy is mc², and when the oscillator is moving, the total energy is gamma mc². So the potential energy plus kinetic energy at any point x should equal the total energy. But at maximum displacement A, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero, and the potential is (1/2) k A². So the total energy E is (1/2)k A² + 0 (since all energy is potential). But wait, that can't be right because the rest energy is mc², which must be part of the energy.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the concepts. In the harmonic oscillator, the potential is (1/2)k x², and in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic is (1/2) m v². But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c².

So perhaps the total energy at any point is the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy. At maximum displacement (x=A), the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is (1 -1) m c² = 0. So E = (1/2)k A² + 0. But wait, that's the same as in the classical case, but that ignores the rest energy. That doesn't make sense. Because the rest energy is part of the total energy.

Wait, maybe the total energy is (1/2)k A² + mc². Because at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential plus the rest energy. But that can’t be right because the rest energy is a constant and doesn't change with motion. So perhaps the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement. Then, at x=0, the potential is zero, so all energy is kinetic plus rest energy.

Wait, but wait, no. The rest energy is a separate concept. The mechanical energy, which is potential plus kinetic, doesn't include the rest energy. So in the non-relativistic case, E_mechanical = (1/2) k A², which is the sum of KE and PE. But in the relativistic case, the mechanical energy would still be (1/2) k A² because that's the energy stored in the oscillator's motion, separate from the rest energy.

Hmm, perhaps I should model the system's energy as the sum of the rest energy plus the mechanical energy. So at x=A, the mechanical energy is (1/2)k A², so the total energy is E_total = mc² + (1/2)k A². But when the oscillator is at x=0, the mechanical energy is all kinetic. So the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c² = (1/2)k A². Because the mechanical energy is (1/2)k A².

So setting up the equation: (gamma -1) m c² = (1/2) k A².

Then, solving for gamma:

gamma = 1 + (k A²) / (2 m c²).

But gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So:

1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (k A²) / (2 m c²)

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term for simplicity. Let’s call it term = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + term.

Then, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + term).

Square both sides: 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + term)^2.

So v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + term)^2]

= [ (1 + term)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + term)^2

Expanding the numerator: (1 + 2 term + term² -1) = 2 term + term^2.

So v²/c² = (2 term + term²) / (1 + term)^2.

But since term is (k A²)/(2 m c²), let's substitute back:

v²/c² = [2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) + (k A²/(2 m c²))^2 ] / [1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2))]^2

Simplify numerator:

2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) = (k A²)/(m c² )

So numerator becomes (k A²/(m c²)) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

Denominator is [ (2 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²) ) ]^2

Wait, perhaps I should factor the numerator and denominator.

But wait, let's factor out (k A²/(2 m c²))^2 from numerator and denominator. Alternatively, maybe we can factor in a way that makes it manageable.

Alternatively, let's let term = (k A²)/(2 m c²). So term is a variable.

Numerator: term*2 + term² = term (2 + term )

Denominator: (1 + term)^2.

So v²/c² = [ term (2 + term) ] / (1 + term)^2.

So v/c = sqrt( term (2 + term) ) / (1 + term )

Hmm. Let's see if this can be simplified. Let me compute the expression inside sqrt:

term (2 + term ) / (1 + term )^2.

Let me compute that:

[ term (2 + term) ] / (1 + term)^2 = [ term (2 + term) ] / (1 + term)^2

Let me expand the denominator: (1 + term)^2 = 1 + 2 term + term^2.

The numerator: 2 term + term^2.

So numerator is 2 term + term^2.

Denominator is 1 + 2 term + term^2.

So the ratio is (2t + t²)/(1 + 2t + t²) = [ t (2 + t) ] / [ (1 + t)^2 ]

Hmm, not sure if that simplifies further, but perhaps it's better to proceed numerically.

Wait, but perhaps I can factor:

Wait, numerator is t(2 + t) = t(t + 2 )

Denominator is (t + 1)^2.

So, [ t(t+2) ] / (t+1)^2.

Not sure, but perhaps we can write it as [ (t+1 -1)(t+1 +1) ] / (t+1)^2.

Wait, t(t +2) = (t +1)^2 - 1.

Because (t+1)^2 = t^2 + 2t +1. So (t+1)^2 - 1 = t^2 +2t.

Which is exactly what t(t+2) is. So:

t(t+2) = (t+1)^2 -1.

So,

[ (t+1)^2 -1 ] / (t+1)^2 = 1 - [1/(t+1)^2 ]

Wait, no: [ (t+1)^2 -1 ] / (t+1)^2 = 1 - [1/(t+1)^2 ].

So v²/c² = [ (t+1)^2 -1 ] / (t+1)^2 = 1 - 1/(t+1)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [ 1/(t+1)^2 ]

Take square root:

v/c = sqrt(1 - [1/(t+1)^2 ]) = sqrt( [ (t+1)^2 -1 ] / (t+1)^2 ) = sqrt( [t(t+2) ] ) / (t+1 )

Wait, but perhaps this isn't helping me much. Let's get back to the expression:

v_max = c * sqrt( [ term (2 + term) ] ) / (1 + term )

Where term = (k A²) / (2 m c² )

Wait, let me plug that in:

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (k A²/(2 m c² )) * ( 2 + (k A²/(2 m c² )) ) ] ) / ( 1 + (k A²/(2 m c² )) )

Let me factor out (k A²/(2 m c² )) from the numerator inside the square root:

= c * sqrt( (k A²/(2 m c² )) * ( 2 + (k A²/(2 m c² )) ) )

= c * sqrt( [ (k A²/(2 m c² )) * ( ( (4 m c² ) + k A^2 )/(2 m c² )) ) ] )

Wait, 2 + (k A²/(2 m c² )) = [4 m c² + k A² ]/(2 m c² )

Because 2 is 4 m c²/(2 m c² ), so 2 = [4 m c² ]/(2 m c² ) = 2.

Wait, no: 2 = (4 m c² ) / ( 2 m c² ) ) = 2. So 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) = [4 m c² + k A² ]/(2 m c² )

So putting it back together:

Inside the sqrt, the product becomes:

(k A²/(2 m c² )) * [ (4 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c² ) ]

Multiply the terms:

= [k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / [ (2 m c² )^2 ]

So the sqrt of that is sqrt( [k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] ) / (2 m c² )

So,

v_max = c * [ sqrt( k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ) ] / (2 m c² ) ) / [ 1 + (k A² )/(2 m c² ) ]

Wait, the denominator after division is [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) ] = [ (2 m c² ) + k A² ) ] / (2 m c² )

So putting it all together:

v_max = c * [ sqrt( k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ) ] / (2 m c² ) ) * (2 m c² ) / (2 m c² + k A² )

Wait, because dividing by a fraction is multiplying by its reciprocal. So let's see:

The denominator after the initial division is [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) ] = (2 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c² )

So when you divide by this, it's the same as multiplying by (2 m c² )/(2 m c² + k A² )

So,

v_max = c * [ sqrt( k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ) ] / (2 m c² ) ) * [2 m c² )/(2 m c² + k A² ) ]

The 2 m c² in the denominator and numerator cancels out:

= c * sqrt( k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ) / (2 m c² + k A² )

Factor inside the sqrt:

k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) = k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 )

So,

sqrt(k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 )) ) = A sqrt( k (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) )

= A * sqrt( k (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) )

Wait, perhaps I can factor that as A * sqrt( k (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) )

So,

v_max = c * [ A sqrt( k (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Hmm, but this seems a bit complicated. Let me think if I can simplify further.

Wait, 4 m c² + k A² = 2*(2 m c²) + k A^2, but not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps we can factor in terms of (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I should try to express the solution in terms of the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m))^2 )

Hmm, let me compute the denominator inside the square root.

But wait, if (k A^2)/(2 m) is a term, but in our case, we have (k A^2)/(2 m c² ), which is dimensionless. So perhaps the options involve a different approach.

Wait, another approach: maybe consider when the speed is maximum, all the energy is kinetic. So E = K = (gamma -1) m c^2.

But earlier, I thought E was (1/2) k A². So perhaps:

(gamma -1) m c^2 = (1/2) k A².

Wait, that's what I used earlier. So gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

gamma = [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 )

Because 1 can be written as (2 m c^2)/(2 m c^2 ), so 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 ).

Then,

gamma = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 )

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 )

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 )

Let me take reciprocal of both sides:

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = [ 2 m c^2 ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Then,

1 - v^2/c^2 = [ (2 m c^2 )^2 ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - [ (2 m c^2 )^2 ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2

= [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 - (2 m c^2 )^2 ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2

Expanding numerator:

( a + b )^2 - a^2 = 2 a b + b^2, where a=2 m c^2, b=k A^2.

So,

= [ 2*(2 m c^2 )(k A^2 ) + (k A^2 )^2 ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2

Factor numerator:

k A^2 [ 4 m c^2 + k A^2 ].

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2

Take square root:

v/c = sqrt( k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

As I found earlier.

But looking at the options, none of them match this expression directly. So perhaps I'm missing a simplification or maybe the options are expressed differently.

Looking again at the options:

Option A: sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2)/(2m))^2 )

Wait, let me see. Let me compute the expression inside the square root:

1 + [1/(1 - (kA^2)/(2m) )^2 ]

= [ (1 - (kA^2)/(2m))^2 + 1 ] / (1 - (kA^2)/(2m))^2 )

But that's not matching what I have. Hmm.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Hmm, inside the square root, 1 plus 1 over (something). Let's compute the term:

1/(1 - (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 )) = [2 m c^2 ]/(2 m c^2 - k A^2 )

So sqrt( 1 + [2 m c^2 ]/(2 m c^2 - k A^2 ) )

Which is sqrt( [ (2 m c^2 - k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 -k A^2 ) )

So numerator: 4 m c^2 - k A^2.

Denominator: 2 m c^2 -k A^2.

So sqrt( (4 m c^2 - k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 - k A^2 ) )

Hmm, but that doesn't match our expression. So I'm not sure.

Option D: sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, let me compute:

1 - [1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ]

= [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 - 1 ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2*(k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) - 1

= [ (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k A^2)^2/(4 m² c^4 ) ]

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k A^2)^2/(4 m^2 c^4 ) ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Factor numerator:

= [ (k A^2/m c^2 ) ( 1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2 ) ) ] / ( 1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe I should go back to the expression I had for v^2/c^2 and see if it can be expressed as one of the options.

v^2/c^2 = [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2

Let me factor numerator and denominator.

The denominator is (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

The numerator is k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )

But 4 m c^2 = 2*(2 m c^2 ), so:

= k A^2 (2*(2 m c^2 ) + k A^2 )

= 2 k A^2 (2 m c^2 ) + (k A^2 )^2 )

Wait, perhaps I can write the numerator as:

k A^2 (2 m c^2 + 2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

= k A^2 [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ]

Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look for which option, when squared, matches the expression I have for v^2/c^2.

Alternatively, perhaps let me consider each option squared.

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m) ))^2 )

So, (v_max)^2 = c^2 [ 1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m) ))^2 ]

= c^2 [ ( (1 - (kA²/(2m) ))^2 + 1 ) / (1 - (kA^2/(2m) ))^2 ]

= c^2 [ (1 - (kA²/m) + (kA²/(2m))² +1 ) / (denominator) ]

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Let me just compute the expression for each option and see which one matches.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the term (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) in the denominator. Let me think about term.

Wait, let me consider option D:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/[1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )]^2 )

Let me compute (v_max/c )^2:

= 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2

= [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 - 1 ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2*(k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) - 1

= [ (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k A^2 )^2/(4 m^2 c^4 ) ]

So,

(v_max/c )² = [ (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k A^2 )^2/(4 m^2 c^4 ) ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Hmm, but our expression for (v/c )^2 is:

[ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2

Which, when we expand, is:

[ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / ( (2 m c^2 )^2 + 4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4 )

Hmm, perhaps not matching directly.

Alternatively, let me compute the numerator and denominator of option D.

The numerator in option D's (v/c)^2 expression is:

(k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k A^2 )^2/(4 m^2 c^4 )

= (4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4 ) / (4 m^2 c^4 )

= k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / (4 m^2 c^4 )

Denominator in option D's (v/c)^2 is:

( (2 m c^2 )^2 + (k A^2 )^2 ) / ( (2 m c^2 )^2 )

Wait, no. The denominator is 1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 = [ (2 m c^2 )^2 + (k A^2 )^2 ] / (2 m c^2 )^2

So,

(v_max/c )^2 (option D) = [ numerator ] / [ denominator ]

= [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / (4 m^2 c^4 ) ] / [ (4 m^2 c^4 + k^2 A^4 ) / (4 m^2 c^4 ) ]

Wait, no. Wait, denominator is [ (2 m c^2 )^2 + (k A^2 )^2 ] / ( (2 m c^2 )^2 )

So,

= [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / (4 m^2 c^4 ) ) ] * [ (2 m c^2 )^2 / ( (2 m c^2 )^2 + (k A^2 )^2 ) ) ]

= [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) * 4 m^2 c^4 ) ] / [4 m^2 c^4 ( (2 m c^2 )^2 + (k A^2 )^2 ) ) ]

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me compute it again.

The numerator is [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (4 m^2 c^4 )

The denominator is [ (2 m c^2 )^2 + (k A^2 )^2 ] / (2 m c^2 )^2 )

So,

(v/c )^2 (D) = [ numerator ] / [ denominator ]

= [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / 4 m^2 c^4 ) ] / [ (4 m^2 c^4 + k^2 A^4 ) / 4 m^2 c^4 ) ]

The 4 m^2 c^4 terms cancel:

= [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (4 m^2 c^4 + k^2 A^4 )

But 4 m^2 c^4 + k^2 A^4 = (2 m c^2 )^2 + (k A^2 )^2

So,

(v_max/c )^2 (D) = [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 )^2 + (k A^2 )^2 ]

Hmm, comparing this to our own expression:

Our (v/c )^2 is [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Wait, so (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 = 4 m^2 c^4 + 4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4.

So,

Our expression:

= [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / [4 m^2 c^4 + 4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4 ]

= [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ]

Which is not the same as option D's (v/c )^2, which has denominator (2 m c^2 )^2 + (k A^2 )^2 =4 m^2 c^4 + k^2 A^4.

Wait, but in our case, the denominator is (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2, which is different.

Hmm. So perhaps option D is not the correct one.

Another approach: perhaps I should look for which option, when squared, equals the expression I obtained for (v/c )^2.

So,

(v/c )^2 = [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2

Let me factor numerator and denominator:

Denominator: (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2

Numerator: k A^2 (2 m c^2 + 2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) = k A^2 [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ]

Hmm, but that doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can factor out (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) in the numerator.

So,

Numerator: k A^2 (2 m c^2 +k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )

= k A^2 ( (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 )

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the numerator as (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) multiplied by something.

Wait, 4 m c^2 +k A^2 = 2*(2 m c^2 ) +k A^2 = 2 m c^2 (2) + k A^2. Not sure.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me instead look for an option that when squared gives the same as our expression.

Looking again at the options:

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ] )

So,

(v/c )^2 = 1 - [ 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 ]

= [ (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2*(k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) -1

= [ (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k A^2 )^2/(4 m^2 c^4 ) ]

So,

(v/c )^2 = [ (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k A^2 )^2/(4 m^2 c^4 ) ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Hmm, but earlier, when I compute our own (v/c )^2, I have:

[ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

So perhaps these are not the same. Let me compute:

Wait, 4 m c^2 +k A^2 = (2 m c^2 ) *2 +k A^2.

But I'm not seeing the connection. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the numerator of option D:

Numerator for option D: (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k A^2 )^2/(4 m² c^4 )

= [4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4 ] / (4 m^2 c^4 )

= k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) / (4 m^2 c^4 )

Denominator for option D: 1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 = [ (2 m c^2 )^2 + (k A^2 )^2 ] / (2 m c^2 )^2

So,

(v/c )^2 (option D) = [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) / (4 m^2 c^4 ) ] / [ (4 m^2 c^4 +k^2 A^4 ) / (4 m^2 c^4 ) ]

The 4 m² c^4 terms cancel, leaving:

= [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / (4 m^2 c^4 +k^2 A^4 )

But our own expression for (v/c )^2 is:

[ k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / ( (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 )

So,

(2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 =4 m² c^4 +4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4

Whereas the denominator in option D is 4 m^2 c^4 +k^2 A^4.

So, unless 4 m c^2 k A^2 is zero, which it's not, the denominators are different.

Hmm, so none of the options A, B, C, D seem to match. That can't be right, so I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait a minute, perhaps I should model the problem differently. Maybe the potential energy isn't (1/2)k A² in the relativistic case. Perhaps the relativistic harmonic oscillator has a different potential.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the potential is (1/2)k x², but perhaps in the relativistic case, the potential is different. But the question states that it's obeying Hooke's law (F = -k x), so the potential should still be (1/2)k x².

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in applying the energy. Let me think again.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is when all potential energy is converted to kinetic. But in the relativistic case, the energy includes the rest mass. So perhaps the total mechanical energy E is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic energy at maximum speed is (gamma -1)m c².

Wait, that's what I did earlier, leading to gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

So, from this, I derived v_max as:

v = c * sqrt( [ term (2 + term ) ] ) / (1 + term )

where term = (k A^2 )/(2 m c² )

Looking at the options, which have terms involving (1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) in the denominator, perhaps I can manipulate the expression to match.

Let me compute:

From gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

gamma = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Take reciprocal:

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = (2 m c^2 )/(2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

Square both sides:

1 - v^2/c^2 = (4 m² c^4 )/( (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 )

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - [4 m² c^4 ]/( (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 )

= [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 -4 m^2 c^4 ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2

Expand numerator:

= [4 m² c^4 +4 m c^2 k A^2 +k² A^4 -4 m² c^4 ] / denominator

= [4 m c^2 k A^2 +k² A^4 ] / denominator

Factor numerator:

= k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) / denominator

So,

v^2/c^2 = [k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 )

Which is the same as earlier.

So, v= c * sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this differently. Let me write it as:

v = c * [ sqrt( k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

= c * [ A sqrt( k (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

Hmm, but this doesn't seem to match any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the restoring force is modified. Maybe F isn't exactly -k x. Because in relativity, the force might be expressed differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach should be to solve the relativistic equation of motion, which is more complicated.

The equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator is d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x.

But this leads to a more complex differential equation, which may not be straightforward to solve.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Maybe it's better to stick with the energy approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the total energy in the relativistic case is the sum of rest mass energy and the mechanical energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

At x=0, all that is kinetic energy, so E = mc² + (1/2)k A² = (gamma m ) c².

So,

gamma m c² = mc² + (1/2)k A²

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

Which is the same as before. So,

gamma = (2 m c² +k A^2 )/(2 m c² )

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = (2 m c² +k A^2 )/(2 m c² )

Which leads to:

v^2/c^2 = 1 - [ (2 m c^2 )^2 ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2

= [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 - (2 m c^2 )^2 ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2

Expanding numerator:

= 4 m² c^4 +4 m c^2 k A^2 +k² A^4 -4 m² c^4

=4 m c^2 k A^2 +k² A^4

= k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 )

So,

v^2/c^2 = [k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2

Which can be rewritten as:

v^2/c^2 = [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 ]

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this as:

= [ k A^2 (2 m c^2 +k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 ]

= [ k A^2 ( (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ) ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 ]

= [ k A^2 (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 k A^2 ] / [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 ]

= [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) * k A^2 + 2 m c^2 k A^2 ] / denominator

Hmm, perhaps this isn't helping. I think I'm stuck here, so I'll check the options again.

Looking at option D:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Let me compute (v_max/c )^2 = 1 - [ 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ]

= [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 -1 ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2

Expanding numerator:

= [1 + (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k A^2 )^2/(4 m² c^4 ) -1 ]

= (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k A^2 )^2/(4 m² c^4 )

= [4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4 ] / (4 m² c^4 )

= k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) / (4 m² c^4 )

Denominator: [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 ] / (2 m c^2 )^2

Wait, no, denominator is (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 = [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ]^2 / (2 m c^2 )^2.

So,

(v_max/c )^2 = [k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) / (4 m^2 c^4 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 / (4 m^2 c^4 ) ]

The 4 m^2 c^4 terms cancel, leaving:

= [k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

Which matches the expression I found earlier.

So, option D gives (v/c )^2 = [k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

Which is exactly what I derived.

Wait, but earlier when I computed option D, I thought the denominator in option D's (v/c )^2 was different, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Yes, after reevaluating, I see that option D's expression does lead to the correct (v/c )^2, which matches our own.

So the correct answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the system using relativistic energy considerations.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy of the oscillator is conserved. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), all the energy is potential energy (\( E_{\text{pot}} = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \)). At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is kinetic energy. The total energy includes the rest mass energy \( mc^2 \) and the mechanical energy.

   At \( x = 0 \), the total energy is given by:
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = \gamma mc^2,
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. At \( x = A \), the total energy is:
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]
   Equating these expressions:
   \[
   \gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]
   Solving for \( \gamma \):
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]

2. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:  
   The Lorentz factor is defined as:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}}.
   \]
   Substituting \( \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we solve for \( v_{\text{max}} \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]
   Rearranging:
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}.
   \]
   Squaring both sides:
   \[
   1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]
   Solving for \( v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 \):
   \[
   v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]
   Taking the square root:
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \) with the given options, we find that it matches **Option D**:
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
