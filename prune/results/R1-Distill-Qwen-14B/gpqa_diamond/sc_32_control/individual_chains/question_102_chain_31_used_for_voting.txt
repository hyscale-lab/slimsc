Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and genetics, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and their developmental fate when the interaction is studied using a bicistronic vector. The setup involves some technical aspects of vectors and expression constructs, and then an experiment where they don't see a green signal in the offspring. The options are about possible reasons why the green signal isn't observed.

So, let's break down the information given. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices (four extracellular), and three beta sheets for binding. 

The vector they used is bicistronic, meaning it has two coding regions (bicistronic = two genes in one construct). The vector is a lox-Cre system. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. The receptor ORF is at the 3' position, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. So, I think that means the ligand is expressed under CBA, and the receptor is expressed under a different promoter, possibly the IRES which allows internal ribosome entry, enabling translation of the second gene without a second promoter.

Between the ligand and mCherry, there's a stop cassette with loxP. And between the receptor and eGFP, there's a stop cassette with lox2272. Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different lox sites. I remember that loxP is a 34 bp site, and lox2272 is a longer one, maybe 38 bp. The Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites and recombines them, causing the DNA between them to be excised if they are in a certain configuration (like in a cassette with a stop).

So the setup is that when Cre is present, it will recombine these sites. So in the vector, the ligand is followed by a stop cassette (loxP-stop), and the receptor is preceded by a stop (lox2272-stop), I think. Wait, no: the ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. Between ligand and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

So when Cre is introduced, it should excise the stop cassettes, allowing the expression of both mCherry and eGFP. Because Cre is used to delete the stop cassettes, allowing the two ORFs to be expressed.

In the experiment, they transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture. Then they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, and Cre under its control would be expressed in neural crest-derived cells, I think.

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope. They don't see a green signal. Wait, eGFP is green, so if the receptor is expressed and eGFP is fused, they should see green in the cells where the receptor is expressed.

But why isn't there a green signal?

The possible options are:

A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship.
Hmm. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression in the same cells, perhaps. But why would that affect the expression of eGFP?

B) Receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi.
If the construct is stuck in the Golgi, it wouldn't get to the cell surface. But why would that happen? Maybe a problem with signal peptides or proper glycosylation. But the question is about the expression in the first place. The vector should have the necessary signals for the receptor to be properly trafficked, assuming the construct is correct.

C) The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing.
The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, so it's likely that the ligand is expressed. The receptor is under IRES, which is usually a weaker promoter but sufficient for co-expression. So maybe the enhancers are not present, but I'm not sure. The promoters are provided, but maybe the construct lacks the necessary regulatory elements for the correct tissue expression. But wait, the mice were crossed to SOX10-Cre, which probably targets Cre expression to neural crest cells, where the receptors are normally expressed.

D) The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame.
Oh, right! If the stop cassette isn't correctly excised, the ORF might not be in frame. The stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272. Cre would recombine lox2272 sites, removing the stop. But if the lox sites aren't correctly placed, or if the stop is in the wrong reading frame, then when the stop is excised, the receptor and eGFP might be in a different frame, leading to a frameshift. This would make the eGFP not expressed, or perhaps cause a premature stop codon.

Wait, but the vector was made as a bicistronic construct with the stop cassettes. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed as ligand-mCherry, and the receptor is followed by a stop, so only the receptor would be expressed (but without eGFP). When Cre is present, the stop cassettes are excised, allowing both mCherry (ligand part) and eGFP (receptor part) to be expressed.

In the mouse model, the construct is homozygous. They crossed the mouse to SOX10-Cre. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so the Cre would be active there, excising the stop cassettes and allowing eGFP expression.

But in the offspring, no green signal is seen. So either the eGFP isn't expressed, or the cells where it should be expressed aren't the ones being visualized, or the construct isn't working.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Because if the stop cassette between receptor and eGFP isn't properly excised, or if upon excision the frames are not aligned, then the eGFP wouldn't be correctly expressed. For example, if the stop is in the same frame as the receptor ORF, then when it's excised, the receptor continues, but perhaps in a different frame, leading to a frameshift. If the fusion is not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be made correctly, leading to no green signal.

Wait, but the vector was designed with the ligand (with mCherry) and the receptor (with eGFP). The stop cassettes are between ligand and mCherry, and between receptor and eGFP. The Cre should excise the stop cassettes, allowing the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP to be expressed.

If the eGFP is not in frame, then when Cre deletes the stop, the receptor is in frame with eGFP. Wait, no, the stop is in a cassette. So the construct would have:

Ligand ORF (with CBA promoter) followed by loxP-stop-loxP, then mCherry.

Then, after the IRES, the receptor ORF, followed by lox2272-stop-lox2272, then eGFP.

So, in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes are present. So the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry, and the receptor ORF is followed by a stop, so eGFP isn't expressed.

When Cre is present, it recombines the loxP sites, deleting the stop, so the ligand is expressed as ligand-mCherry. It also recombines the lox2272 sites, deleting the stop between receptor and eGFP, so the receptor is expressed as receptor-eGFP.

But if the stop cassettes are in the wrong orientations, or the sites are not correctly identified by Cre, perhaps the stop isn't removed. Or perhaps the lox2272 sites are not correctly recognized, so the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP is not correctly excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but why would that happen? The vector design is that in the presence of Cre, the stop cassettes are excised, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed. But if the lox sites are not correctly placed, or if Cre isn't active in the right cells, that could be a problem.

But the question states that the mouse is homozygous for the construct. They crossed to SOX10-Cre, which is a transgenic line where Cre is under the control of the SOX10 promoter, so Cre should be expressed in neural crest-derived cells, like astrocytes, perhaps. So the Cre should excise the stops in those cells, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

But perhaps the stop cassettes were not correctly excised. Alternatively, maybe the frame isn't correct.

Wait, the vector has the stop cassette in front of the eGFP. So when Cre deletes it, the receptor is in frame with eGFP? Wait, perhaps the ORF is receptor followed by stop, then eGFP. So when the stop is removed, the ORF becomes receptor-eGFP. But if the stop is between them, and the reading frame is correct, then the two would be in frame. But if the stop is in the same reading frame as the receptor's coding sequence, then upon excision, the frame could be disrupted, leading to a frameshift, and eGFP not being expressed correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop was in the wrong frame, so when it's excised, the reading frame of the receptor and eGFP ORFs are not aligned, leading to a frameshift. That would prevent proper eGFP expression.

So if the stop is in the same frame as the receptor, then upon excision, the receptor's ORF continues, but into eGFP's ORF, but in a different frame. So eGFP wouldn't be correctly produced.

So in that case, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the frames are not aligned, so the fusion protein isn't made, and thus the eGFP isn't visible under the microscope.

So the correct answer would be option D, the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the IRES isn't working correctly. But IRES elements are typically for allowing the expression of the second gene without a strong promoter. So maybe the IRES isn't functioning, but the question says that the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is strong. So the receptor would be expressed weakly, but perhaps not enough to be detected.

But the question is about the eGFP not being expressed at all.

Alternatively, maybe the expression is only in the ligand, but not the receptor.

Wait, but the setup is that the vector is bicistronic. So both ligand and receptor should be expressed. The ligand is expressed as ligand-mCherry, and the receptor as receptor-eGFP. But the presence of the stop cassettes is controlling this.

In the absence of Cre, the ligand would be expressed as ligand-mCherry (since the stop is between ligand and mCherry; but wait, in the absence of Cre, the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed? Wait, the ligand ORF is first, then the stop. Oh wait, the setup is that the ligand ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry, but between ligand and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So in the absence of Cre, the stop cassette would prevent mCherry from being expressed. Because the ligand is expressed, but the mCherry is behind a stop. So perhaps the ligand ORF is expressed, but not mCherry. Similarly, the receptor ORF is followed by a stop, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But when Cre is present, it excises both stops. So the ligand would be expressed as ligand-mCherry, and the receptor as receptor-eGFP.

But in the experiment, the green signal isn't observed. So the eGFP isn't expressed. Why?

Another possibility is that the Cre isn't active in the cells where the receptor is expressed. But the mice were crossed to SOX10-Cre, so the Cre should be active in neural crest cells, which express the receptor.

Wait, but SOX10 is expressed in the neural crest, which is where the receptor is expressed. So the Cre should be active there, excising the stops.

So why isn't eGFP expressed?

If the stop cassettes aren't excised, then the eGFP isn't expressed. So perhaps the lox sites are not correctly arranged for Cre to excise them.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP is in the wrong orientation, so Cre can't excise it.

But the question states that the vector is correctly made, so perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, the problem says that the ligand's ORF is at the 5' position, and the receptor is at the 3' with eGFP. The ligand has a stop in loxP, and the receptor in lox2272. So when Cre is present, it deletes the stops, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

But if the stop between receptor and eGFP is in a different reading frame than the receptor, then upon excision, the ORF is in frame, leading to correct eGFP expression. If it's not in frame, then the ORF would be out of frame, leading to a frameshift and potentially a nonfunctional eGFP.

So the answer would be D, the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame.

Alternatively, another possibility: maybe the IRES is not working. IRES elements are typically used to allow internal initiation of translation, but if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor might not be expressed. But the question says that the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, and the receptor is under IRES. So if the IRES isn't working, the receptor wouldn't be expressed, but then why would the eGFP not be expressed? Because the stop cassette wasn't excised, so the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But I think that's a different issue than the frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the expression vectors aren't working because the promoter isn't active in the cells, but the CBA promoter should be active in many cells.

Wait, the question says that after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture, they tested expression by Western blot. They saw signals proportional to actin loading, which suggests that the proteins are being expressed. So if the vector works in culture, but not in the transgenic mouse, perhaps something else is wrong.

Wait, but the mouse is homozygous for the construct. Then, when crossed to SOX10-Cre, the Cre would excise the stops. So perhaps in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed because the frame is wrong.

So, the correct answer is D: the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand fused to mCherry and a receptor fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. Stop cassettes (loxP-stop-loxP for the ligand-mCherry and lox2272-stop-lox2272 for the receptor-eGFP) are present between the respective coding sequences and fluorescent proteins. The vector is introduced into a mouse model homozygous for the construct, which is then crossed to SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10-Cre is expected to excise the stop cassettes in neural crest-derived cells, allowing expression of mCherry and eGFP. However, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under the confocal microscope. The possible reasons for this outcome are analyzed as follows:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   A paracrine relationship refers to signaling between nearby cells, but this does not explain why eGFP is not expressed in the same cells where the receptor is expressed. The question focuses on expression within the same construct, not cellular communication. This option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP construct were stuck in the Golgi, it would not reach the cell surface, and eGFP would not be visible. However, the vector design includes proper signal sequences for trafficking, and the absence of eGFP is more likely due to an issue with expression rather than trafficking. This option is less likely.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element, which should allow its expression. The absence of an enhancer is unlikely to explain the lack of eGFP expression, especially since the construct works in primary astrocyte culture. This option is unlikely.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   The stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP must be excised by Cre to allow proper expression of the receptor-eGFP fusion. If the stop cassette is not excised or if the frames of the receptor and eGFP are misaligned due to the stop cassette being in the wrong reading frame, the eGFP would not be expressed correctly. This would result in no green signal, as observed. This is the most likely explanation.

The absence of a green signal is best explained by the receptor and eGFP being out of frame, preventing proper expression of eGFP.
