Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and try to understand what's happening.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, creating product 1. The product's ¹H NMR shows some specific peaks and an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR, excluding any that exchange with D2O.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. I think this is a dehydrohalogenation reaction, probably elimination. Since there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons (1 and 3 on adamantane), heating with a strong base like KOH would likely form an alkene via an E2 mechanism. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Also, the IR has an absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe it's not just elimination—could it be a substitution?

Wait, wait. 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH. If it's a double elimination, maybe forming an epoxide? No, wait, epoxides would require an oxide ion, right? Or maybe it's a di-elimination to form an allene or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution to form a diol? Because KOH is a base, but in such conditions, it can act as a nucleophile too. But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, which suggests something like a ketone or ester. So maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some kind of oxidation or elimination that forms a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought. Maybe it's a double elimination, but adding water to form an ether. No, because the IR would show an ether around 1100 cm⁻¹. But our IR is at 1720, which is more likely a ketone or maybe an ester.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The structure of adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would be two bromines on adjacent (but opposite?) positions. When treated with KOH, perhaps each Br leaves, and the adjacent Hs are abstracted by the base, leading to elimination. So two eliminations would form a double bond. But wait, adamantane is a rigid structure, so perhaps the two Br atoms are on carbons that are adjacent in a way that elimination leads to a bridge structure.

Wait, but if two adjacent Br atoms are removed, the molecule would form a bridge, maybe creating a bicyclic system with a double bond. Alternatively, maybe each Br is removed, and the adjacent Hs are abstracted, leading to a conjugated diene? Hmm, but I'm not so sure.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by an OH. But then the IR would show an O-H stretch, which is around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹. But the IR given is at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So substitution doesn't seem right here.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: When 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with a strong base like KOH, maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation, leading to a conjugated diene. But the IR doesn't show any C=C peak (which is around 1600-1680 cm⁻¹), so maybe that's not it. Or perhaps the product is a ketone. Wait, how would a ketone form from this reaction?

Wait, could it be that the two Br atoms are on secondary carbons, and when KOH is used, it's a double elimination leading to a ketone? No, that doesn't quite make sense. Wait, perhaps the elimination forms a cyclopropane? No, I'm not getting it.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. So for 1,3-dibromoadamantane, each Br might be replaced by an OH group because KOH is a strong base. But then the product would be 1,3-diol-adamantane. But then the IR would show O-H stretching. But the IR is at 1720, so maybe it's an ester or a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the di-bromide undergoes a Hofmann elimination, but that's usually for vicinal dihalides. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a vicinal dihalide? No, because 1 and 3 are not adjacent carbons on the adamantane structure. Hmm. Maybe I need to think about the structure of adamantane.

Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1 and 3 positions would be on adjacent carbons in a way that they are connected through the structure. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane framework.

Wait, perhaps when KOH is added, it's a double dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of an allene (conjugated diene) or a carbonyl group. But how would that happen? If two adjacent Br atoms are removed, each elimination would form a double bond.

Wait, but in an allene, the two double bonds would be adjacent, which might not be possible due to the structure of adamantane. Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a bicyclic structure with a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps it's more likely that each Br is replaced by an alkoxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product's NMR. Product 1's ¹H NMR shows 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Let me think about each peak.

The 4.79 ppm is a triplet of 2H, perhaps indicating an -OCH2- group. But wait, another possibility is a vinyl group, but that's usually around 5 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether's adjacent group.

Wait, but wait a minute. The IR shows 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. So the product has a carbonyl group. So likely, the product is a ketone. How can 1,3-dibromoadamantane form a ketone upon treatment with KOH?

Ah! Maybe it's a double elimination where each Br is removed, and the adjacent Hs are abstracted, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. Wait, but elimination forms alkenes, but perhaps in some cases, like in the presence of a base, if there's a possibility for forming a conjugated system, it could form a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the base causes a dehydrohalogenation leading to a carbonyl via a peroxide formation, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen condensation or something similar, but I'm not sure. Wait, another thought: If each Br is on a tertiary carbon, then eliminating each Br would form a carbonyl via elimination. Wait, but elimination usually forms alkenes, not ketones. Oh, perhaps if each elimination is on adjacent carbons and forms a conjugated system, but that's not directly forming a ketone.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the product is a diketone. But that would require two carbonyl groups, but the IR would perhaps show two peaks or a specific pattern. But the IR here is a single peak at 1720, which is typical for a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a nucleophilic substitution. But if it's KOH, and the solvent is likely aqueous, then maybe each Br is replaced by an OH group. So product 1 would be 1,3-diol-adamantane. But then, the IR would have O-H stretches, which aren't mentioned. The product's IR is at 1720, which suggests a carbonyl. So that's conflicting.

Hmm. Maybe the initial step isn't substitution but elimination. Let me think again. If the molecule is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH is a strong base, perhaps it abstracts β-hydrogens leading to the formation of a double bond. But then, why the IR shows a carbonyl?

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the elimination forms an epoxide. Wait, but an epoxide would have an O in the ring, and the formation would require an oxide ion. KOH is a strong base but not an oxide source. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, forming a ketone. Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation leading to a diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a reaction where two eliminations lead to a carbonyl group. Oh! Maybe it's a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that requires a ketone and an oxidizing agent. Wait, no, that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation that forms a bicyclic ketone. Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid with four cyclohexane rings. The 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent carbons, but in a way that they are across a bridge.

Wait, perhaps when KOH removes both Br atoms via elimination, the structure forms a bridge with a carbonyl group. For example, each elimination forms a double bond, but the bridge would then have a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the product is adamantanone. Adamantanone has a ketone group in the structure. So how would that form?

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br atoms on adjacent carbons. Upon treatment with KOH, perhaps each Br is replaced by an O−, leading to the formation of a ketone. But wait, that's substitution, not elimination. Let me think: If each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridgehead, then replacing each Br with a hydroxyl group would lead to a diol, but that doesn't produce a ketone.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the NMR data of product 1. The NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a triplet. That's probably a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester. Wait, if it's an ether, like OCH2CH2O, but then the adjacent groups would affect the shift.

Alternatively, 4.79 ppm is around where you might see a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like in an epoxide. But in an epoxide, the protons are usually around 3-4 ppm. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought. The IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl. So the product must have a carbonyl group. So perhaps the reaction is a double elimination to form a carbonyl.

Wait, how about the formation of a ketone via elimination of HBr twice. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → when treated with KOH, each Br is eliminated with an adjacent H, forming a double bond. But how would that form a ketone?

Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an allene, which then undergoes some oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Unless the structure rearranges.

Hmm, perhaps I should look up the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Wait, I can't look things up, but I'll try to think about similar reactions. Vicinal dihalides (adjacent dihalides) treated with strong base like KOH typically undergo elimination to form alkenes. So if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a vicinal dihalide, then elimination would form an alkene. But how would that give a carbonyl group?

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about the structure. Maybe 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide but a 1,3-dihalide with the Br's on the same face or something. But I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the product after KOH is a diol, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Wait, maybe the diol undergoes some oxidation. But the reaction conditions are heating with KOH, which is a base, not oxidizing.

Wait, another approach: the product after KOH has a carbonyl. So product 1 is likely a ketone. So the reaction must be forming a ketone from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH.

Wait, perhaps it's a pinacol-type elimination. Pinacol rearrangement involves 1,2-diols eliminating to form a carbonyl. But we're starting with dihalides, not diols.

Wait, perhaps the dihalide is treated with a base, leading to the formation of a gem-diolate intermediate, which then loses H2O to form a carbonyl. But wait, that would require a diol formation first.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an O−, leading to a dianion which then eliminates to form a carbonyl. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + 2 KOH → 1,3-diol-adamantane + 2 HBr. But that would just be substitution, leading to a diol, not a ketone.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Let's think about the next step. Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(i-Pr)3) is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So perhaps product 1 has a carbonyl group (from the IR) and is being subjected to some reaction, maybe acylation? Or perhaps it's a dehydration.

Wait, product 1 is a ketone. Heating with Al isopropoxide could be part of a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but for that, the ketone would need to act as an acylating agent. Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is undergoing some cyclization or rearrangement.

Wait, but product 2 is then treated with ozone. Ozonolysis is typically used to break double bonds. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyl groups.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone, product 2 is an alkene formed via some elimination, and product 3 is the ozonolysis product.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, which when treated with Al isopropoxide undergoes some elimination to form an alkene, which is then ozonolyzed.

Wait, let's try to outline all steps again.

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid; IR 1720 cm⁻¹ → carbonyl)
2. product 1 + Al(i-Pr)3 → product 2
3. product 2 + ozone → product 3 (after workup with DMS)

The question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen.

So, let's try to figure out each step.

Step 1: Product 1 is likely a ketone. Considering the structure of adamantane, perhaps the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and elimination forms a bridge with a ketone group. So, product 1 is 1-adamantanone or a similar ketone.

Step 2: Heating product 1 with excess Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, so maybe it's used to abstract a proton, leading to the formation of an enol or some conjugated system. Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it undergoes some kind of elimination to form an alkene. For example, a keto-enol tautomerism followed by elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, but product 2 is then subjected to ozonolysis, which suggests it has a double bond. So perhaps product 2 is an alkene derived from product 1.

If product 1 is a ketone, maybe product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. For that, a dehydration would have to occur. So, product 1 (a ketone) → product 2 (an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone) via elimination.

Wait, but Al isopropoxide is used as a catalyst in such eliminations. So, perhaps product 1 is a diol, which under acid catalysis (like Al isopropoxide) loses water to form an alkene. Hmm, but product 1 is a ketone.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a diol (1,3-adamantanediol), then heating with Al isopropoxide (a strong acid) would dehydrate it to form an alkene.

Wait, but earlier we thought product 1 has a carbonyl group. So maybe I was wrong about product 1. Let me reevaluate.

If product 1 is a diol, then the IR would show O-H stretches, but the IR here is at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl.

So, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. How would that happen? Heating a ketone with a Lewis acid could lead to a conjugated enone via elimination.

Wait, for example, if product 1 is a cyclic ketone, perhaps with adjacent hydroxyl groups, which under acid conditions lose water to form a conjugated double bond. Or maybe product 1 is a diketone, which upon elimination forms an alpha,beta-unsaturated diketone.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a cycloketone, and the acid catalyzes a ring-opening or some rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a gem-diketone, but that's less likely.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Since it's a diamondoid structure, with two Br atoms on adjacent bridgeheads, perhaps elimination would form a bridge with a double bond, but that might create a bridgehead double bond, which is usually not possible because of Bredt's rule. Oh wait, adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so bridgehead double bonds are allowed in some cases, like in norbornene.

Wait, so if product 1 is a diene, but the IR shows a carbonyl, that doesn't fit. So maybe product 1 is a ketone formed via a different mechanism.

Wait, another possibility: The base, KOH, causes the elimination of HBr from each Br atom, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. So, two eliminations, each removing HBr and forming a double bond, but then maybe the two double bonds could form a conjugated system, leading to a carbonyl?

Wait, I'm not getting it. Let me think about the product's NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a methyl group attached to an oxygen. Wait, but 4.79 is more upfield for a CH2 group. Maybe it's an ether group or an epoxide.

Wait, the integration is 2H, so perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) suggests multiple equivalent protons, perhaps in a ring structure. And 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group.

Hmm, so perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ether, but that would have different IR. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, with a bridge and a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: Maybe product 1 is a di-substituted adamantane with a ketone group. So, the structure is such that there's a carbonyl group in the bridge, and the NMR shows the neighboring groups.

But I'm not making much progress. Let me try to think about step 3, the ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of an alkene typically cleaves it into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was. The coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton would depend on the structure around the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps in product 2, the molecule has a conjugated diene or an isolated double bond. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. Then, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, perhaps on adjacent carbons.

The most deshielded proton would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group. In the NMR spectrum, these protons are usually deshielded and can show specific coupling patterns.

So, considering each option:

A) triplet: maybe coupled to two neighboring protons.

B) triplet of triplets: coupled to two sets of protons, each with two neighbors.

C) doublet of triplets: coupled to two different sets of protons, each triplet.

D) pentet: coupled to four equivalent protons.

Wait, if the proton is adjacent to a carbonyl group and has two neighboring protons on either side, perhaps it would split into a triplet. Or maybe more.

Alternatively, if the proton is at the end of a chain, perhaps it's coupled to two protons on the adjacent carbon, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but the most deshielded proton would be near the carbonyl. Let's imagine product 3 has a structure where a CH2 group is next to a carbonyl. The CH2 protons would each be split by neighboring protons.

Alternatively, if the proton is in a CH group next to a carbonyl, it would couple with adjacent protons.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone with a CH2 group in between. Then, the protons on that CH2 would each be split into a triplet if each is adjacent to two equivalent protons on each neighboring carbon.

Alternatively, maybe the structure has a CH group next to a carbonyl, which is adjacent to a CH2 group. Then, the CH proton would be split into a triplet of triplets, each due to coupling with two protons on neighboring carbons.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps I can think of a specific structure. Let me outline:

Product 1: 1-adamantanone (a ketone in the adamantane structure).

Product 2: heated with Al isopropoxide could cause elimination, forming an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. So product 2 would have a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group.

Product 3: Ozonolysis of the double bond would break it into two carbonyl groups. So, for example, if product 2 was cyclohexenone, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two ketones.

Wait, but in adamantane's case, the double bond would be in a bridge structure. Ozonolysis would cleave the bridged double bond, and perhaps the product would have two ketone groups in a bridge structure.

Alternatively, maybe the ozonolysis forms two carbonyl groups, each connected to the adamantane framework.

So, when looking at the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded protons would be those adjacent to the carbonyl groups.

Suppose in product 3, there's a structure like:

R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-R'

In this structure, the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls would have protons that are deshielded. Each CH2 would have two protons, each coupling with the neighboring carbons.

Wait, but if each CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, perhaps the protons would be in a coupling pattern influenced by adjacent groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 group is next to a carbonyl and a bridge, leading to specific coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded proton is part of a CH group next to a carbonyl and a CH2 group, leading to complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis leads to a structure where each carbonyl is attached to a CH group, which is next to another CH group. For example:

O=CR-CR=O

Each R could be a bridge or part of the adamantane framework.

In this case, the protons on the CR would be adjacent to the carbonyl and possibly another group. So, each H on the CR would couple with the adjacent CR's H. If each CR has two Hs, then each H would couple with two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but if each CR has only one H, then each would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if each CH is adjacent to another CH group, each with two Hs, each H would have two neighboring Hs on each adjacent carbon, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, maybe each CH has two Hs, each coupling with two Hs on each adjacent carbon, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's think about the coupling patterns.

A triplet of triplets occurs when a proton is coupled to two sets of protons, each of which has two neighbors. For example, a proton coupled to two equivalent protons (a triplet) and another set of two equivalent protons (another triplet), the splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if a proton is coupled to two different sets of protons, each of which is a triplet, then the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

So, in the structure I'm imagining, the most deshielded proton (adjacent to the carbonyl) might be coupled to two different sets of adjacent protons, each causing a triplet splitting.

Looking at the options, option B is triplet of triplets, and option C is doublet of triplets. So which one fits?

If the proton is coupled to two sets of two equivalent protons (each set causing a triplet), then it's a triplet of triplets (option B). If it's coupled to one set of two (triplet) and another set of one (doublet), then it would be a triplet of doublets, but that's not one of the options here.

Alternatively, if the proton is coupled to two different triplets, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, based on the structure, perhaps the coupling is a triplet of triplets, making option B the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure leads to a doublet of triplets, which would be option C. I'm not sure, but based on the reasoning, I think option B is more likely.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning behind the final answer:

1. **Step 1: Reaction with KOH**  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, forming a light yellow solid (product 1).  
   - The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O).  
   - The ¹H NMR spectrum of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H).  
   - Based on the IR data, product 1 is likely a ketone. A plausible structure is 1-adamantanone, where the rigid adamantane framework contains a ketone group.

2. **Step 2: Reaction with Al(i-Pr)₃**  
   - Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(i-Pr)₃), a strong Lewis acid.  
   - This step likely induces an elimination reaction, forming an α,β-unsaturated ketone (product 2).  
   - The elimination reaction removes a water molecule, creating a conjugated system with a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group.

3. **Step 3: Ozonolysis**  
   - Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide (DMS).  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3, which contains two carbonyl groups.  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group, as carbonyls strongly deshield nearby protons.

4. **Analysis of the Coupling Pattern**  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group and is coupled to protons on neighboring carbons.  
   - If this hydrogen is coupled to two sets of protons, each causing a triplet splitting, the overall coupling pattern would be a **triplet of triplets**.  
   - This pattern arises when the proton is influenced by two distinct sets of neighboring protons, each with two equivalent neighbors.

Based on the reaction sequence and the structural reasoning, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet of triplets**.

**Answer: B**
