Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson X. Let me try to think through this step by step. Hmm, the question is about the allowed decay channels of the boson X, considering the interaction Lagrangian given.

First, I remember that in particle physics, the decay of a particle is possible if the energy (or mass) of the particle is greater than the sum of the masses of the decay products. So for a boson X to decay into two particles, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of each of those particles.

The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. Now, I need to figure out which fermions can be produced when X decays. The Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λ_f fψ̄ f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully.

Wait, the interaction term is L = -λ f ψ̄ f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh, but maybe I'm getting confused with the notation. Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is something like X ψ ψ, so when X decays, it couples to fermion-antifermion pairs. So the decay would be X → f f-bar.

So the possible decay products are any fermions that X can couple to. But wait, the problem is about kinematical allowance, so even if the interaction allows it (like via the Lagrangian), we also need to check if the mass of X is sufficient to produce the fermion pair.

So first, let's think about the possible fermions f that can be produced. The interaction term probably allows X to decay into any fermion that the X couples to. So the term is something like X ψ̄ ψ, which would imply that X can decay into any fermion species that the model allows.

But wait, the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f fψ̄ (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe ψ_f is the fermion field, and perhaps the interaction is X ψ ψ. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair as long as the mass allows.

So the possible decay channels are into any fermion pair where 2*m_f ≤ m_X. Since m_X is 6 GeV, I need to find all fermions with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV each, because 2m_f ≤ 6 → m_f ≤3 GeV.

Wait, but wait, the fermions are usually much lighter. Let me think about the masses of the known fermions.

Electron: about 0.0005 GeV (negligible)
Muon: ~0.105 GeV
Tau: ~1.777 GeV
Up quark: ~2 MeV (≈0.002 GeV)
Down quark: ~4.7 MeV (≈0.0047 GeV)
Charm quark: ~1.27 GeV
Strange quark: ~95 MeV (≈0.095 GeV)
Bottom quark: ~4.5 GeV
Top quark: way too heavy, ~173 GeV. So X can't decay into top quarks because 2*173 is way more than 6 GeV.

Wait, but wait. So for each fermion pair (like e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, etc.), their masses should satisfy 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV.

So let's list the fermions:

- Electron (e): m=0.0005 GeV → 2m ≈ 0.001 GeV → allowed.
- Muon (mu): 0.105 GeV → 2m ≈0.21 GeV → allowed.
- Tau (tau): 1.777 GeV → 2m ≈3.554 GeV. Wait, wait, 3.554 is more than 3 GeV (since X is 6 GeV, so 3 GeV per fermion). So 3.554 > 3 → So tau would require 2*1.777=3.554 GeV, which is larger than 6 GeV? Wait, no, 3.554 is less than 6 GeV. Wait, wait, no! 2m_f must be <= m_X. Since m_X is 6 GeV, 2m_f <=6 → m_f <=3 GeV.

Tau's mass is about 1.777 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So tau can be produced, as 2*1.777=3.554 GeV <6 GeV.

Wait, no, no. m_X is 6 GeV. So 2m_f ≤6 → m_f ≤3 GeV. So any fermion with mass <=3 GeV can be a decay product.

Wait, but Tau is 1.777 GeV, which is less than 3, so 2*1.777=3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So yes, X can decay into tau+ tau-.

What about the quarks?

- Up quark: 0.002 GeV → 2m=0.004 GeV → allowed.
- Down quark: 0.0047 GeV → allowed.
- Strange quark: ~0.095 GeV → 2m =0.19 GeV → allowed.
- Charm quark: 1.27 GeV → 2m=2.54 GeV → allowed.
- Bottom quark: 4.5 GeV → 2m=9 GeV, which is larger than 6 → so bottom quarks are too heavy.

So the allowed quarks are u, d, s, c. And the leptons are e, mu, tau.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but the bottom quark is 4.5 GeV, so 2m=9 GeV. X is 6 GeV, which is less than 9 GeV, so b quark is not allowed.

So any decay into bottom quarks isn't possible. So option A includes b, which shouldn't be allowed. So that's incorrect.

Option B: c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, charm quark's mass is 1.27 GeV → 2m=2.54 GeV, which is allowed. So c is allowed. So option B includes c, which is correct. But what about tau? Yes, as 1.777 GeV is allowed. So the decay to tau is allowed, but option B includes tau. Let me check the options.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option B: X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that includes tau, which is allowed because 2m_tau is 3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So that's okay.

Option C: X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, t t-bar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

But top quark is way too heavy, so t t-bar would require 2*173 GeV, which is 346 GeV, way beyond X's 6 GeV. So option C is not allowed.

Option D: X→b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

But b is 4.5 GeV, so 2m=9 GeV >6 GeV. So option D is incorrect.

Wait, but wait. If the mass of X is 6 GeV, then for each fermion pair, the sum of their masses must be ≤6 GeV. So for each f f-bar, 2m_f must be ≤6 GeV.

So, what's the mass of the tau? 1.777 GeV, so 2m=3.554 GeV, which is allowed.

Charm quark: 1.27 GeV → 2*1.27=2.54 GeV → allowed.

So in the options, which options include only allowed fermions?

Looking back:

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

That's correct because all of these 2m_f are ≤6 GeV.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed.

So the correct option would be B.

Wait, but looking at the question again, the interaction term is written as L = -λ f f ψ̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps I got the interaction wrong. Wait, maybe the term is X ψ ψ, which would mean X can decay into any fermion pair that it couples to. So the allowed fermions are the ones present in the model.

Wait, but the problem statement says the interaction is given by L(y) = -λ f f ψ̄ (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps I should parse that correctly. Wait, perhaps ψ̄ f(y) is the Dirac adjoint of the fermion field, and ψ_f(y) is the fermion field. So the interaction term would be X(y) ψ̄ (y) ψ(y), which is a Yukawa-like coupling.

So the interaction is X ψ ψ, which means that X can decay into any fermion species that ψ represents. So perhaps the fermions that X can decay into are the ones present in the model, i.e., all possible fermions (like u, d, s, c, b, t, etc.), but only if kinematically allowed.

Wait, but from the Lagrangian, it's written as -λ f f ψ̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Maybe I'm misinterpreting the variables. Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is Xψψ, and the fermions are any of the types, so X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair.

But regardless, the kinematic constraint is what matters. So for each decay channel, 2m_f <= m_X.

So for each possible fermion:

Electron: yes, allowed.

Muon: yes.

Tau: yes, because 2*1.777 = 3.554 GeV <6 GeV.

Charm quark: 1.27 GeV → 2.54 GeV <6 → allowed.

But bottom quark: 4.5 GeV → 9 GeV >6 → not allowed.

So the allowed fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but what about the up quark? Its mass is about 2 MeV, so 2m is 4 MeV, which is way below 6 GeV. So yes, u is allowed.

Same with down quark, strange quark.

So the possible decay channels are into any of these fermions.

So looking at the options, option B includes all of these except for the top quark and bottom quark.

Option B: c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So that's correct.

Options:

Option B is the correct one.

To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with mass \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), we analyze the interaction Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y),
\]

which implies that \( X \) can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair (\( f \bar{f} \)) it couples to. The kinematic constraint for a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) is:

\[
2m_f \leq m_X,
\]

where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion \( f \). Given \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), this implies \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses and Allowed Decays
1. **Electron (\( e \)):** \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_e \approx 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
2. **Muon (\( \mu \)):** \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
3. **Tau (\( \tau \)):** \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.554 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
4. **Up quark (\( u \)):** \( m_u \approx 0.002 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_u \approx 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
5. **Down quark (\( d \)):** \( m_d \approx 0.0047 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_d \approx 0.0094 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
6. **Strange quark (\( s \)):** \( m_s \approx 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_s \approx 0.19 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
7. **Charm quark (\( c \)):** \( m_c \approx 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \approx 2.54 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
8. **Bottom quark (\( b \)):** \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \approx 9 \, \text{GeV} \), **not allowed**.
9. **Top quark (\( t \)):** \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \), **not allowed**.

Thus, the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are into the following fermion pairs:
- \( e^+ e^- \),
- \( \mu^+ \mu^- \),
- \( \tau^+ \tau^- \),
- \( u \bar{u} \),
- \( d \bar{d} \),
- \( s \bar{s} \),
- \( c \bar{c} \).

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A:** Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > m_X \). Incorrect.
- **Option B:** Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C:** Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t > m_X \). Incorrect.
- **Option D:** Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > m_X \). Incorrect.

### Final Answer
The correct option is **B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \).

**Answer: B**
