Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state relates to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. So the energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to the lifetime of the state. The formula is ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant and τ is the lifetime.

Wait, Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But when dealing with energy in eV, I think I need to convert units properly. Let me think about the steps.

First, I need to find the uncertainty in energy for each state. Since the lifetimes are different, their uncertainties will be different.

For E1, τ1 = 1e-9 seconds. So ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1. Similarly, ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2, where τ2 is 1e-8 seconds.

Wait, let me compute the ratio of the uncertainties. Since τ2 is ten times larger than τ1, the uncertainty ΔE2 should be smaller than ΔE1 by a factor of 10. Because ΔE is inversely proportional to τ.

Wait, actually, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So if τ increases, ΔE decreases.

So for E1: ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(1e-9 s)
E2: ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(1e-8 s)

Which is ΔE1 = 1e9 * ħ / (1 s)
ΔE2 = 1e8 * ħ / (1 s)

So ΔE1 is ten times larger than ΔE2. Because 1e9 is ten times bigger than 1e8.

Now, to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE between them must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Or wait, what's the condition for distinguishability?

I think the energy levels must be separated by more than the uncertainty in energy. So ΔE must be greater than the sum of ΔE1 and ΔE2. Because each state has its own uncertainty, and for the energy levels to be resolvable, the separation should be larger than either uncertainty, but wait, perhaps the combined uncertainty.

Wait, more accurately, the energy levels can be distinguished if the separation ΔE is greater than the uncertainty in energy of either state. Because if the separation is less than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart.

So for the two states to be clearly resolved, the energy difference ΔE must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if ΔE is bigger than the larger uncertainty, then you can distinguish them.

Alternatively, I think the condition is that the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the individual uncertainties. Wait, I'm not too sure. Let me think again.

Suppose each has an uncertainty ΔE1 and ΔE2. The energy levels must be spaced so that the separation is larger than the uncertainty in each. So ΔE > max(ΔE1, ΔE2). Because if the separation is bigger than both uncertainties, then you can definitely see a distinct peak for each.

But wait, sometimes when dealing with two states, the combined uncertainty would be the sum, but in this case, each state's uncertainty is due to its own lifetime. So for two separate states, each with their own lifetimes, the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties. Wait, maybe. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the error in the energy measurement is the sum of the individual uncertainties. For example, if you have two states, their combined uncertainty might be the sum of their individual uncertainties. So the energy difference should be bigger than that sum to be resolved.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach it step by step.

First, compute the uncertainty for each state.

Compute ΔE1 and ΔE2:

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-8 s) = 1.0545718e-26 J.

But wait, these are in Joules. I need to convert to eV because the options are in eV.

1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J. So to convert J to eV, divide by 1.602e-19.

So:

ΔE1 = 1.0545718e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ (1.0545718 / 1.602) * 1e-6 eV.

Calculating 1.0545718 / 1.602 ≈ approximately 0.658.

So ΔE1 ≈ 0.658e-6 eV = 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = 1.05457e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ (1.05457 / 1.602) * 1e-7 eV.

Which is approximately 0.658e-7 eV = 6.58e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 6.58e-8 eV.

So the uncertainties are 6.58e-7 and 6.58e-8 eV, respectively.

Now, to resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE must be greater than each of these uncertainties. Wait, no. Because each energy level has its own uncertainty. So the separation must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Or perhaps the sum.

Wait, maybe the correct condition is that the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties. Because if ΔE is larger than both, then the states are resolvable. Alternatively, considering the uncertainty in the system's energy when looking at both states.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is that the energy difference must be larger than the maximum of the individual uncertainties. Let me think: if the separation is larger than the larger uncertainty, then you can tell them apart.

So, which is larger, ΔE1 or ΔE2? ΔE1 is larger (6.58e-7 is bigger than 6.58e-8). So the separation must be greater than 6.58e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV = 0.001e-6 eV = 1e-9 eV. That's smaller than 6.58e-7.

B) 1e-11 eV. Even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV. That's way larger than 6.58e-7 eV.

D) 1e-8 eV. Which is 1e-8, which is smaller than 6.58e-7.

So the only option that is larger than 6.58e-7 eV is option C.

Wait, wait, but option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than necessary. Let me double-check. Because 1e-4 is 1e-4 eV, which is 100 microeV. While the required ΔE is about 6.58e-7 eV, which is 0.658 microeV.

So option C is way larger than needed. But the question is which option could be the energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved. So any ΔE larger than the maximum uncertainty would work.

Therefore, option C is a possible answer, but let's look at the other options. Are any of the other options larger than 6.58e-7 eV?

Option A: 1e-9 eV = 0.001e-6 eV = 1e-9. That's 0.001 n eV, much smaller than 658e-9 eV.

Option B: 1e-11 eV. Even smaller.

Option D: 1e-8 eV. 1e-8 is 0.01e-6 eV, which is 0.01 microeV. Still smaller than 0.658 microeV (which is 6.58e-7 eV).

So the only option that is larger than 6.58e-7 eV is option C (1e-4 eV). Therefore, the correct answer is C.

Wait, but why is option C an option? Because 1e-4 eV is a large energy difference and would certainly be distinguishable. So yes, that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I should use the natural line width formula. The natural linewidth is given by ΔE = ħ / τ. So for E1, τ1 is 1e-9 s, so ΔE1 is ħ/(1e-9).

Calculating that:

ħ is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s (since 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so 1 J·s = 1e30 eV·s? Wait, perhaps I should use the value of ħ in eV·s.

Wait, 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 1 J = 6.242e18 eV.

So ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s = 1.0545718e-34 * 6.242e18 eV·s ≈ approx 6.58e-16 eV·s.

So ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (6.58e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) )= 6.58e-7 eV.

That's the same as before.

Similarly, ΔE2 = 6.58e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.58e-8 eV.

So the maximum uncertainty is 6.58e-7 eV. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than this to be resolved.

Looking back at the options, the only one that satisfies this is option C, which is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. That's 1e4 times larger than 6.58e-7 eV, so it's way above the required threshold.

But wait, in reality, the energy difference only needs to be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. So any ΔE larger than 6.58e-7 eV would work. So for example, 1e-6 eV is 1e-6, which is 1.529e-1 times larger than 6.58e-7. So 1e-6 would be acceptable. But none of the options have 1e-6 except perhaps option A which is 1e-9, which is smaller.

Wait, the options are A) 1e-9, B) 1e-11, C) 1e-4, D) 1e-8.

So only option C is larger than the required 6.58e-7 eV. Because 1e-4 is 1e-4, which is 1e3 times larger than 6.58e-7.

So the correct answer is C) 1e-4 eV.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), we use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau},
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \)). The uncertainties in energy for the two states are:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) between them must be greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties, \( \max(\Delta E_1, \Delta E_2) \). Here, \( \Delta E_1 > \Delta E_2 \), so the condition becomes:

\[
\Delta E > 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, we evaluate the given options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \), which is also smaller than \( 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition \( \Delta E > 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) is **Option C**. Therefore, the energy difference must be at least \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to clearly distinguish the two energy levels.
