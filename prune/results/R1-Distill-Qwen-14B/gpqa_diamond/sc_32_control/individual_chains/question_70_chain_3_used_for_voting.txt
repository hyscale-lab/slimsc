Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by breaking down what each part says. 

The problem is about some reactions and then determining the molecular symmetry group of a product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. Hmm, I remember that these are point groups, which are used to describe the symmetry of molecules.

First, let me list the reactions given:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

I need to figure out what E is, and then determine its molecular symmetry.

Let me think about each reaction step by step.

Starting with reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. Solid A and gas B produce a bright red product C. I'm trying to think of a reaction where a solid plus a gas (maybe something like O2?) in a 8:1 ratio forms a red product. Wait, maybe A is sulfur? Because sulfur (solid S8) reacts with something. Oh wait, when sulfur is burned in excess oxygen, it forms SO2, but that's a gas. Alternatively, maybe A is something else.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe A is something like Fe (iron), reacting with S (sulfur) in a certain way. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach: the product C is used in reaction 3, which upon reacting with water gives A plus two acids. So, if C is a compound that when hydrolyzed gives A and two acids, perhaps it's a sulfide or something similar.

Another idea: When a metal reacts with sulfur, it forms a sulfide. For example, Fe + S → FeS. But that's a 1:1 ratio. Wait, though. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal oxide. If A is a metal oxide, reacting with B as a halogen or something else... Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, let's look at reaction 3 again. C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, strong acid could be H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), and weak might be H2S (but that's a gas, not an acid in solution). Alternatively, maybe F is HCl (strong) and G is H2S (though that's more like a weak acid). Or perhaps F is HNO3 and G is something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, if C is a metal sulfide, then reacting with water would produce the metal hydroxide (maybe A is the hydroxide?), and H2S gas. But then F would be H2S, which is a weak acid. But that doesn't fit with F being a strong acid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfate. So when C (like a sulfate salt) reacts with water, it might hydrolyze. Wait, but that might not produce two different acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite. No, not sure.

Wait, let's think about the reactions again. C is formed from A and 8 equivalents of B. Then C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. D and B form H when in 1:1 ratio, which is a solvent. So what's B and D?

Another angle: In reaction 4, B and D react in 1:1 to form H, a solvent. Common solvents include water (but that's H2O, so B and D would be H and O?), but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe H is something like H2O, but how? Or H could be something else like ethanol, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, if H is a solvent and is formed from B and D in 1:1, perhaps H is something like H2O if B and D are O2 and H2? No, O2 and H2 would make H2O in a 2:1 ratio. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps H is NH3. Then B and D could be N2 and H2, but that's a 1:3 ratio. Doesn't fit 1:1.

Wait, maybe B is O2 and D is H2. Then H is H2O, but for that, the reaction would be O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O. So in reaction 4, it's 1 mole each? No, because O2 and H2 would combine in a 1:2 ratio. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the products. Product E is formed when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. And E is extremely hazardous. So what could E be? Maybe a toxic gas? Like HCl? Or SO2? Or perhaps something like phosgene? Or maybe E is a highly toxic compound like sarin gas, but that's probably too specific.

Wait, perhaps E is a nerve agent, but I'm not sure about the reactions. Alternatively, E could be something like chlorine gas, but that's not formed here. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide. Let me think again. If A is a metal sulfide, then reacting with water would produce the metal oxide (or hydroxide) and H2S. But in reaction 3, C + H2O → A + F + G. So A is a product along with two acids. So maybe A is a metal oxide, and when C (which is a sulfide) reacts with water, it produces the metal oxide (A), and two acids. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate. For example, if A is a metal, B is sulfur, then the reaction could be something like A (sulfur) reacting with B (oxygen) to form C as a sulfate. Then, when C reacts with water, it might hydrolyze into the metal oxide (A) and sulfuric acid (F, a strong acid) and perhaps another acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: reaction 3 produces two acids. F is strong, G is weak. Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is a strong acid, and maybe H2S is the weak one. So if C is a sulfide, perhaps.

Wait, but C is a product of A and B. Let's say A is S8 (solid), B is O2 (gas). Then, 8 equivalents of O2 would react to form SO3? No, because S8 plus O2 in a certain ratio forms SO2 or SO3. Wait, the reaction of S8 with O2 is typically in a 1:4 ratio for SO2. But the problem states 8 equivalents. Hmm. So 1 mole of A (S8) reacts with 8 moles of B (O2) to form 8/4 = 2 moles of SO3? Wait, no, the reaction is S8 + 8 O2 → 8 SO2 (if I'm not mistaken). Wait, no, the balanced equation for S8 plus O2 to make SO2 is: S8 + 8 O2 → 8 SO2. So in that case, 1 mole of S8 reacts with 8 moles of O2 to form 8 moles of SO2. That fits with the first reaction: A is S8, B is O2, C is SO2.

Then, reaction 3: SO2 reacts with water. But wait, SO2 + H2O can form H2SO4 (but that's not directly). Actually, SO2 is a gas, but when it dissolves in water, it forms H2SO3 (sulfurous acid), which is a weak acid. Hmm, but the reaction says it produces two acids, F and G, one strong and one weak. So maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something else. Let me think about other possibilities.

Another approach: the product E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. E is extremely hazardous. So perhaps E is something like phosgene (COCl2), but I'm not sure. Another possibility is a cyanide compound, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe E is a highly toxic gas like Cl2, but that doesn't fit the reaction.

Wait, considering that D and B form H, which is a solvent. If B is O2 and D is something else. Suppose B is Cl2. Then D would be something that when reacted with Cl2 forms a solvent. For example, if H is CHCl3 (chloroform), but then B and D would have to be CHCl2 and Cl2? No, that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps H is H2O, which is a solvent. Then, D and B would have to react to form H2O. So, B and D could be H2 and O2. But then, in reaction 4: B (O2) + D (H2) → H (H2O). The reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So in the reaction, 2 moles of H2 and 1 mole O2 form 2 H2O. So the ratio is 2:1, but the problem says 1:1 ratio between B and D. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe this isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is H2. Then, H would be HCl, which is a gas, but not a solvent. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe H is something like NH3. Then, B and D would be N2 and H2. But the ratio for NH3 is 1 N2 : 3 H2 → 2 NH3. So that's a 1:3 ratio, which doesn't fit the 1:1 given.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Let me try to think about other possibilities for C.

Wait, the first reaction is A + 8 B → C. So 8 equivalents of B. Let's say B is H2. Then, 8 H2 would react with A. If A is Fe, for example, Fe + H2 (but that seems less likely as H2 is a reducing agent). Alternatively, maybe A is a metal oxide, like Fe3O4, reacting with H2 to form Fe and water. But that doesn't fit the product being a bright red solid.

Wait, bright red product C. That makes me think of something like a sulfide. For example, CuS is black, but maybe FeS is a different color. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfur compound. Another possibility is that C is a nitride or something else.

Wait, another angle: the product C, when reacting with D, produces E, which is extremely hazardous. If E is a nerve agent, it's probably something like sarin or VX, but I'm not familiar with the reactions leading to those. Alternatively, E could be something like hydrogen cyanide (HCN), which is toxic, but perhaps the reaction isn't leading to that.

Alternatively, maybe E is something like H2SO4, but that's not a gas, so perhaps not.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide, and D is something like Cl2. Then, when C reacts with Cl2, it could form SO2Cl2 (thionyl chloride), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps when C is a sulfide, reacting with Cl2 would produce HCl and S, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if C is NH3 (but that's a gas, not a solid). Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product E. If E is a product of C and D, and E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a highly toxic gas like HCN. But how would that form?

Alternatively, maybe E is ClF3 or something, but again, not sure.

Wait, let me think of another approach. Maybe product C is a diatomic molecule. For example, if C is O2 or O3. But O2 is a gas, and the product is a solid, so that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is SO3, which is a liquid or solid under certain conditions. If C is SO3, then when it reacts with water, it would form H2SO4 (strong acid) and perhaps another acid, but I'm not sure. Wait, SO3 + H2O → H2SO4. That's a single product, not two. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem says two different acids. So maybe C is a compound that can hydrolyze into two acids. Another possibility is if C is a sulfite, such as Na2SO3. Then, upon hydrolysis, it might form H2SO3 (sulfurous acid, weak) and another acid? Or perhaps another scenario.

Wait, another thought: If C is a sulfate salt, like Na2SO4, then upon hydrolysis, it might not produce acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonate. For example, if C is CaCO3, reacting with water wouldn't produce acids, but if it's a carbonate that decomposes, like upon heating, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride like Mg3N2. Mg3N2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if C is a sulfide, like FeS. Then, FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 (which is not very stable) and H2S. H2S is a weak acid. So in this case, product A would be Fe(OH)2, F could be H2S (weak), but where's the strong acid? Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe C is a dichromate, like K2Cr2O7. When it reacts with water, perhaps it can form H2Cr2O7, but that's a strong acid. Wait, but I don't see where the two acids would come from. Hmm.

Another angle: The first reaction produces C as a bright red solid. That makes me think of something like mercury(II) oxide, which is red, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide, like Fe3O4 (magnetite), which is black. Hmm, not red.

Wait, another thought: Phosphorus reacts with chlorine to form PCl5, which is a white solid. But I don't think that's red. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide of a transition metal. For instance, CoS is a dark blue solid, but CuS is black. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a nitrosyl compound. For example, NOCl is a yellow liquid. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a different kind of compound. Let me think about reaction 2 again. C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. So if C is a diatomic molecule, reacting with two of D would form something else.

Wait, if C is O2, and D is F2, then 2 O2 + 4 F2 → 2 O2F2. But I'm not sure about the products.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a solid oxide, like Na2O. Then, when it reacts with D, which is Cl2, maybe it forms NaCl and something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is a metal, B is a halogen. For example, Reaction 1: A (metal) reacts with 8 equivalents of B (Cl2) to form C, which is a chloride. Then, C reacting with water could produce the metal hydroxide (A) and HCl (strong acid, F) and perhaps another acid, but I'm not sure where the second acid comes from.

Wait, but perhaps C is a mixed chloride. Not sure. Another approach: Let's think about the products. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So if F is HCl (strong) and G is H2S (weak), then C must be a compound that upon hydrolysis produces both HCl and H2S. That would suggest that C contains both Cl and S in some form. Hmm, but that seems a stretch.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide with a metal that forms a strong acid upon hydrolysis. For example, if C is (NH4)2S, then reacting with water would produce NH4OH (weak acid, but not sure) and H2S. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester or something else. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about E. If E is a product formed when C reacts with D, and E is extremely hazardous, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas. One such gas is hydrogen cyanide (HCN), but how would that form?

Alternatively, perhaps E is a phosgene, which is COCl2. But how would that form from C and D?

Wait, if C is CO and D is Cl2, then CO + Cl2 might not react directly. Alternatively, maybe C is something else.

Wait, perhaps the key is to find C and then E. Another angle: in reaction 4, B and D form H, which is a solvent. If H is a common solvent like ethanol, then perhaps B is O2 and D is something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if H is H2O, then B and D would have to be O2 and H2, but the ratio is 2:1 for the formation of H2O, which doesn't fit the 1:1 ratio in reaction 4.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to think of each step again.

Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red solid).

Reaction 2: C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous).

Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

Reaction 4: D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent, 1:1 ratio).

So, perhaps I should figure out what H is, since it's a solvent formed from B and D in a 1:1 ratio.

Common solvents include water, ethanol, methanol, acetone, etc. Let me think:

If H is water, then B and D would have to form H2O. The reaction for that is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So ratio is 2:1 H2:O2. But in reaction 4, it's 1:1, so this doesn't fit.

If H is ethanol (C2H5OH), then B and D could be C2H4 and H2O? Not sure.

Alternatively, if H is methanol (CH3OH), then B and D could be CO and H2: CO + 2 H2 → CH3OH. That's a 1:2 ratio, which doesn't fit the 1:1 in reaction 4.

Wait, another solvent is NH3. How would that form? It requires N2 and H2 in a 1:3 ratio, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe H is HCl, but that's a gas, not a solvent.

Alternatively, maybe H is something like CH4O (formaldehyde), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps H is something like H2S, but that's a gas.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the first reaction again. A + 8 B → C. If A is S8 (solid) and B is O2 (gas), then 1 S8 + 8 O2 → 8 SO2. SO2 is a gas, but the product C is a solid. So that can't be right. Wait, maybe C is a solid like Fe3O4, but that doesn't fit with the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal, and B is a halogen. For example, Fe (solid) + Cl2 (gas) → FeCl3. But the stoichiometry would be Fe + 3 Cl2 → 2 FeCl3. So that's a 1:3 ratio, not 8:1. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: in reaction 3, when C reacts with water, it produces A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So perhaps C is a compound that upon hydrolysis yields a metal oxide (A), a strong acid (like H2SO4), and a weak acid (like H2S). But how?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed anhydride. For example, something like H2SO4·H2S? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a salt that contains both sulfates and sulfites. When it hydrolyzes, it produces H2SO4 and H2S. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps if C is a sulfide, like FeS, then FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 + H2S. Fe(OH)2 is a weak base, not an acid. So that wouldn't produce F as a strong acid. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: if C is a nitride, like Mg3N2. Mg3N2 + 6 H2O → 3 Mg(OH)2 + 2 NH3. NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a carbide, like CaC2. CaC2 + 2 H2O → Ca(OH)2 + C2H2↑. C2H2 is acetylene, which isn't an acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a peroxide. For example, Na2O2. Na2O2 + H2O → 2 NaOH + O2↑. But that gives a base and O2 gas, not acids. Not matching.

Another approach: F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. Let's list some strong and weak acids. Strong: HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak: CH3COOH, H2S, HCN.

If F is H2SO4 (strong acid) and G is H2S (weak acid), then perhaps C is a sulfate and sulfide combination. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester or something else.

Wait, another angle: the reaction of C with 2 equivalents of D forms E. If E is a highly hazardous product, possibly a gas, maybe a nerve agent. Another angle: perhaps C is a chlorinated compound.

Wait, perhaps C is SOCl2. Then, when it reacts with D (maybe H2O?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, SOCl2 reacts with something else to form E.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. Let me think about the options again. The question is about the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on point groups. Let me recall:

- C2: two-fold rotation axis.
- D4h: dihedral group with four-fold rotation and horizontal mirrors.
- D∞h: infinite symmetry, like a cylinder (e.g., CO2 has D∞h symmetry? No, CO2 is D2h. Wait, maybe a linear molecule with multiple atoms like O2 or HCN? O2 is D∞h because it's a diatomic with infinite symmetry along the bond axis.

Wait, O2 is a diatomic molecule with a bond axis (C2), and since it's linear, it has D∞h symmetry. Similarly, HCN is a linear molecule and also has D∞h symmetry. CO2 is linear but has a center of inversion, so its point group is D2h.

If E is a diatomic molecule like O2, then its point group would be D∞h. But O2 is a diatomic with two atoms, so symmetry elements include a C2 axis (which is the bond axis), and since it's diatomic, the symmetry group is D∞h because of the infinite reflections perpendicular to the axis. Wait, no: O2 has D∞h symmetry because it's a linear molecule with a two-fold rotation axis and mirrors at 90 degrees, but I might be mixing things up.

Alternatively, if E is a non-linear molecule, like a trigonal planar one, but the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps E is a molecule like phosgene (COCl2), which is a trigonal planar molecule. The point group for phosgene is D3h. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, another possibility: If E is a molecule with two-fold rotation and a mirror plane. For example, H2O has C2v symmetry, because it's a bent molecule with a C2 axis and two mirror planes. Looking at the options, option D is C2v.

Wait, but if E is H2O, is that extremely hazardous? Not really, but maybe in certain contexts. Hmm.

Alternatively, if E is a linear molecule like CO2, which is D2h, but that's not an option. Wait, the options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Wait, if E is a molecule with a C2 axis and a mirror plane, its point group would be C2v (option D). For example, H2O is C2v. Alternatively, if E is a diatomic molecule, like O2, which has D∞h symmetry (option B or C).

Wait, the options are B) D4h and C) D∞h. O2 has D∞h symmetry, so option C is D∞h. If E is O2, then the symmetry group would be D∞h.

But how does E form? Let me think.

Perhaps E is O2. So, when C reacts with D, which is O2? No, because in reaction 2, C reacts with D to form E. If E is O2, that doesn't make sense because D is a reactant. Alternatively, maybe E is O3 (ozone), which is a triatomic molecule. Ozone has a point group of D3h, which isn't an option here.

Wait, but earlier I thought that if E is O2, then its point group is D∞h. So if E is O2, but how does that form from C and D? Let me re-examine reaction 2.

Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E. If E is O2, then perhaps D is O2 as well? No, because then it would be C + 2 O2 → O2, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps E is O3, but that's not D∞h.

Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track. Let's think about reaction 4: D and B form H in a 1:1 ratio, and H is a solvent. Let's say H is H2O. Then, reaction 4 is B + D → H2O. If B is O2 and D is H2, then 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But that's a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. So this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if H is NH3, then B and D would need to be N2 and H2 in a 1:3 ratio, but reaction 4 is 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Another thought: Maybe H is a chlorinated solvent, like CH2Cl2. But I'm not sure about the reaction.

Wait, perhaps H is an alcohol, like ethanol. Then B and D could be ethylene (C2H4) and H2O. But that's a 1:1 ratio? Not sure about the reaction.

Alternatively, maybe H is CH3OH (methanol), formed from CO and H2 in a 1:2 ratio, but that doesn't fit 1:1.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck here. Let me try to approach this from the perspective of the point groups. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Option C is D∞h, which is the symmetry of O2, HCN, etc. If E is O2, D∞h would be correct. But how would E be O2?

Wait, reaction 2: C reacts with D to form E. If E is O2, then C + 2 D → O2. That would require D to be O2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe D is O3 and E is O2, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another angle: If E is a molecule with D4h symmetry, then it's a tetrahedral molecule, but I'm not sure which E would fit that.

Alternatively, if E is something like SO2, which has a bent structure, its point group is D2h. Not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps E is a molecule like H2O, which has C2v symmetry (option D). But earlier I thought E would be O2, but if E is H2O, then perhaps it's a different scenario.

Wait, but looking back, the first reaction produces a bright red product C. If C is SO2, which is a gas, but the problem says C is a solid. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe C is a solid oxide.

Wait, perhaps C is FeO (iron(II) oxide), which is a black solid, not red. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a different oxide. Wait, MnO is a pink solid, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfur compound. If C is S (elemental sulfur), which is bright yellow, but the problem says bright red. Not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide with a red color. For example, CuS is black, but perhaps another sulfide. Alternatively, maybe it's a different compound.

Hmm, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think of E's structure. If E has D∞h symmetry, then it's a linear molecule with a center of symmetry. Like O2 or HCN.

So, if E is O2, then reaction 2 would need to produce O2. How?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide, like H2O2. Then, reaction 2: H2O2 + 2 D → E. If D is O2, then E would be O2 again, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, D could be something that reacts with H2O2 to form O2.

Wait, but H2O2 decomposes into H2O and O2: 2 H2O2 → 2 H2O + O2. But that's a decomposition reaction, not a reaction with another gas D. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is H2O2, and D is something that catalyzes its decomposition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is another compound that when reacts with D produces O2.

Wait, if C is KClO3 and D is H2SO4, then heating them can produce KCl, SO2, H2O, and O2. But that's more of an acid-base reaction, and I'm not sure if it fits the stoichiometry.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the point groups again.

If E's point group is D∞h, then it's a linear molecule with an infinite number of symmetry planes. So, for example, O2 or HCN.

If E is O2, which is a diatomic molecule, then point group is D∞h. So, perhaps E is O2.

Then, reaction 2: C + 2 D → O2. How?

If D is O3, then C + 2 O3 → O2. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O, and C is something that decomposes into O2 when heated with H2O. For example, perhaps C is KClO3, which when heated with H2O can produce O2, but I'm not sure about the exact reaction.

Alternatively, maybe C is a peroxide, like Na2O2, which when reacts with another peroxide (maybe D is another peroxide?), but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps D is H2O. Then, reaction 2: C + 2 H2O → E (O2). That would mean C is decomposing in the presence of water to produce O2. Maybe C is a metal peroxide, like PbO2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorate, like Ca(ClO3)2. When heated with water (acid?), it can decompose into ClO2, Cl2, and O2. But that's speculative.

Hmm, this is taking a while. Let me try to make a table of possibilities.

Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red solid).
Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).
Reaction 4: B + D → H (solvent, 1:1).

If H is H2O, then reaction 4 would require B and D to form H2O in a 1:1 ratio. So, possible reactions could be:

B is H2, D is O2 → 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. Ratio is 2:1 → doesn't fit.
B is O2, D is H2 → same as above.

Alternatively, perhaps B is CO2 and D is H2O. But CO2 + H2O → H2CO3. So ratio is 1:1. So if H is H2CO3, which is a weak acid, but not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps H is CH3OH. Then, B could be CO and D could be H2: CO + 2 H2 → CH3OH. But that's a 1:2 ratio, which doesn't fit the 1:1 in reaction 4.

Wait, perhaps B is H2O and D is something else. Wait, reaction 4 is B + D → H. If H is a solvent and B is H2O, that seems circular.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is CH4. Then, O2 + CH4 → CO2 + 2 H2O. But that's combustion, and the ratio is 1:1 for CH4:O2, but it's an exothermic reaction. So H would be CO2 and H2O, but that's not a single solvent.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess.

Given that the options for E's symmetry group include D∞h, which is the symmetry of O2, and if E is O2, then perhaps the answer is D∞h (option C).

Alternatively, if E is a molecule like HCN, which is linear and has D∞h symmetry, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but earlier I thought that E is formed when C reacts with D. If E is O2, then perhaps reaction 2 is C + 2 D → O2. If D is O3, then C + 2 O3 → O2. But that's a bit of a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps E is H2O, which has C2v symmetry (option D). But earlier I thought that doesn't fit because H2O is not extremely hazardous.

Wait, but the problem states that E is extremely hazardous. So maybe E is a highly toxic gas like HCN, which is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry.

If E is HCN, then how does it form?

Reaction 2: C + 2 D → HCN.

So, perhaps D is CN- and C is something that when reacts with CN- gives HCN. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe D is H2 and C is CN- reacting to form HCN. But that doesn't fit with the other reactions.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Given the information, I think E is O2, which has D∞h symmetry, so the answer would be C) D∞h.

The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. This suggests a reaction where A and B combine in a specific stoichiometric ratio to produce a red solid. A possible candidate for C is a compound like SO2 or a sulfide, but the exact identity remains unclear.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. The formation of E suggests a reaction involving a gas D, which could be a halogen or another reactive species. The hazardous nature of E points to a toxic gas like O2 or a nerve agent, but the exact identity is ambiguous.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This indicates that C is likely a compound that hydrolyzes to yield a metal oxide (A), a strong acid (e.g., H2SO4), and a weak acid (e.g., H2S). However, the exact identity of C remains uncertain.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This suggests that B and D combine to form a common solvent like H2O, CH3OH, or another liquid. However, the exact nature of H is unclear due to the limited information.

Given the options for the molecular symmetry group of E, the analysis focuses on the symmetry of potential candidates for E. If E is O2, a diatomic molecule, it has **D∞h** symmetry, which corresponds to a linear structure with a two-fold rotation axis and multiple symmetry planes. This aligns with the description of E as a hazardous product, as O2 is a highly reactive gas. Other options, such as H2O (C2v) or HCN (D∞h), were considered but did not fit as well with the reactions described.

Based on the reasoning, the most plausible symmetry group for E is **D∞h**, consistent with O2 or a similar linear molecule.
