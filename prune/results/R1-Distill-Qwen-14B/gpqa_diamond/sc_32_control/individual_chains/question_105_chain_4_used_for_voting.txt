Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again and think step by step.

Alright, the question is about a star with some dark spots on it, and how that affects the observed brightness. The scenario is that these spots are causing photometric variations, and astronomers might mistake this for an exoplanet. The task is to find out what the radius of such an exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star.

Let me jot down the given information:

- The star's radius is the same as the Sun's. So Rstar = R_sun.
- The spots cover one hemisphere, so the area covered is half the star's surface, right? Oh wait, wait. The filling factor is 20%, so the spots take up 0.2 of the hemisphere's area. Oh wait, no. Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of one hemisphere.

But wait, each hemisphere is half of the star's surface, so the total area being spotted is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) )? Hmm. So the total spotted area would be 0.2 times that, which is 0.1 π Rstar².

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of flux. Because the brightness variations come from the change in flux when the spots rotate into and out of view.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spot temperature is 5000 K.

When the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view, causing a dip in brightness because those spots are emitting less flux than the rest of the star.

The question is asking, if instead of spots, there was an exoplanet transiting the star, what radius would the planet need to have to produce the same change in brightness (the same amplitude in the light curve).

So the idea is to calculate the fractional change in brightness (ΔF / F) caused by the spots, and then set that equal to the fractional change caused by a planet transit, then solve for the planet radius.

First, let's model the brightness variation due to spots.

The star emits a certain amount of flux. When a spot is on the visible side, it's a cooler area contributing less flux. The total flux is the sum of the unspotted parts and the spotted parts.

The star's total flux without any spots (F0) would be F0 = σ Teff^4 * (4 π Rstar^2) / (4 π D^2) ), but the distance D cancels out when considering relative changes, so perhaps we can think in terms of the star's total luminosity.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the flux change as the difference between the star's normal flux and the flux when part of it is blocked or cooler.

But let me think in terms of the star's flux. The star's total flux when spots are present is F = F_unspotted + F_spotted.

Wait, the star's surface has some parts at 6000 K and some at 5000 K. So the total flux is the sum of each area's contribution.

But when the star is rotating, only a part of the surface is visible. Wait, the problem says that only one hemisphere is spotty. Wait, no, the star is observed as a disk, and as it rotates, the spots come into view. So the maximum variation would occur when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, no. Let me re-read: "As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation."

So the star is rotating, and as it spins, the spotted hemisphere comes into view, then goes away. So the observed flux will dip when the spots are visible.

The key is to compute the maximum dip in flux when the spots are fully visible.

So, the unspotted part of the star (the other hemisphere) is at 6000 K, and the spotted part is at 5000 K, and the filling factor is 0.2.

Wait, but the spotted hemisphere is one side of the star, so the area of the star that's spotty is one hemisphere (half the star's surface) multiplied by the filling factor. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (0.5 * 4 π Rstar²) ) = 0.2 * 2 π Rstar² = 0.4 π Rstar².

Wait, no. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's area that's covered by spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (area of hemisphere).

The area of a hemisphere is 2 π R². So area of spots is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R². So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux from the star is the sum of the unspotted part and the spotted part.

Wait, but when the star is viewed from Earth, the visible hemisphere is the one with the spots. So the area of the star that's visible (the hemisphere we see) is 2 π R². But within that, 20% is spots, so 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R² is spots, and the rest is normal.

So, the total flux when spots are visible would be:

F_spotted = F_normal * (1 - filling_factor) + F_spots.

F_normal is the flux per unit area of the unspotted regions, which is σ Teff^4.

F_spots is σ (Teff - ΔT)^4, where ΔT is 1000 K, so T_spot = 5000 K.

So let's compute the flux from the normal parts and the spots.

The total flux from the unspotted part (normal) of the visible hemisphere is (1 - 0.2) * 2 π R² * σ (6000)^4.

The flux from the spots is 0.2 * 2 π R² * σ (5000)^4.

So the total flux when the spots are visible is:

F1 = ( (0.8 * 2 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 ) + (0.2 * 2 π R² * σ (5000)^4 )

The total flux when the spots are not visible (i.e., the other hemisphere is facing us) is F0 = 2 π R² * σ (6000)^4.

Wait, no: when the other hemisphere is facing us, which is the unspotted hemisphere, so F0 = 2 π R² * σ (6000)^4.

So the change in flux is F0 - F1.

But the fractional change in flux, which is (F0 - F1)/F0.

Let me compute this.

F0 = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4.

F1 = [ (0.8 * 2 π R² σ (6000)^4 ) ) + (0.2 * 2 π R² σ (5000)^4 ) ) ].

So F1 = 2 π R² σ [0.8 * 6000^4 + 0.2 * 5000^4 ].

So F1 = F0 * [ 0.8 (6000^4 / 6000^4) + 0.2 (5000^4 / 6000^4) ) ].

Simplify:

F1 = F0 * [0.8 + 0.2 * (5000/6000)^4 ]

Compute (5000/6000)^4: that's (5/6)^4.

5^4 is 625, 6^4 is 1296. So 625/1296 is approximately 0.482253.

So 0.2 * 0.482253 = 0.09645.

So F1 = F0 * (0.8 + 0.09645) = F0 * 0.89645.

So the flux when spots are visible is 0.89645 F0. The change in flux is F0 - F1 = F0 (1 - 0.89645) = F0 * 0.10355.

So the fractional change is (F0 - F1)/F0 = 0.10355, or about 10.355% dip in flux.

Wait, but wait. If the spots are cooler, the flux should decrease. But the calculation shows that F1 is less than F0, which is correct because when the spots are visible, the total flux is less. So the dip is 10.355%.

But wait, am I sure about this? Because the star is emitting less when the spots are visible, so the observed flux is lower. So the photometric variation would have a dip of about 10.355%.

Now, the question is, what planet radius would cause the same dip when it transits the star. Because when a planet transits, it blocks some of the star's light, leading to a dip in brightness proportional to the area blocked.

The area blocked is (R_planet / R_star )^2, assuming the planet's disk is small compared to the star.

So the fractional dip is (R_p / R_star)^2.

Wait, wait. Because when the planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's light, so the dip is F_blocked = (π R_p²) / (π R_star²) ) = (R_p/R_star)^2.

But wait, that's only when the planet is directly in front of the star. So the dip is (R_p / R_star)^2.

So the dip in this case is 10.355%, so:

(R_p/R_star)^2 = 0.10355.

Taking square roots, R_p/R_star = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

So approximately 0.32.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check my math.

Wait, 0.32 squared is 0.1024, which is close to 0.10355. So R_p/R_star is about 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.32.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the flux calculation.

Wait, another approach. Let's think in terms of the average flux from the star when the spots are visible.

Each spot is cooler, so it emits less than the surrounding. The total flux is the sum of the normal areas and the spotted areas.

Let me compute the flux from the spots and the normal parts.

Each unit area on the star emits σ T^4.

The unspotted area in the visible hemisphere:

Area = 0.8 * 2π R² = 1.6 π R².

Flux from unspotted: 1.6 π R² * σ (6000)^4.

Spotted area: 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

Flux from spotted: 0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4.

So total flux F1 = 1.6 π R² σ (6e3)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5e3)^4.

Factor out π R² σ:

F1 = π R² σ [1.6 * (6e3)^4 + 0.4 * (5e3)^4 ].

The star's total flux without spots (F0) is π R² σ (6e3)^4 * 2 (since the other hemisphere is all normal? Wait, no, wait. When the other hemisphere is visible, the entire hemisphere is normal, so F0 is 2 π R² σ (6e3)^4.

Wait, no. Wait, the star is a sphere. So when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is 2 π R² σ (6e3)^4.

When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is 2π R² σ [ (0.8 * 6e3^4) + (0.2 *5e3^4) ) ].

Wait, no. Because the spotted hemisphere is one hemisphere, and when it's visible, the entire hemisphere is a mix of 80% normal and 20% spots.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as the average flux per unit area in the visible hemisphere.

So the average flux per unit area when the spots are visible is:

(0.8 * (6000)^4 + 0.2 * (5000)^4 ) / (6000)^4.

Which is 0.8 + 0.2*(5000/6000)^4.

So the total flux F1 is F0 * (0.8 + 0.2*(5/6)^4 )

Which is the same as I calculated before.

So F1 = F0 * (0.8 + 0.2*(5000/6000)^4 )

Which is F0 * (0.8 + 0.2*(0.482253) )

0.2 * 0.482253 = 0.09645.

So F1 = F0 * 0.89645.

So the dip is F0 - F1 = F0*(1 - 0.89645) = F0*0.10355, about 10.355% dip.

So the fractional dip is 0.10355.

The planet transit dip is (R_p/R_star)^2.

So set (R_p/R_star)^2 = 0.10355.

So R_p/R_star = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218, so approximately 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.32.

Hm. But wait, let me recheck the calculation. Because 0.32^2 is 0.1024, which is very close to 0.10355. So yes, 0.32 is the right answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the actual numbers more accurately.

Compute (5000/6000)^4:

(5/6) = approx 0.833333.

(5/6)^4 = (0.833333)^4.

Let's calculate:

0.833333^2 = 0.694444.

0.694444^2 = approx 0.482253.

So yes, same as before.

So 0.2 * 0.482253 is 0.09645.

So 0.8 + 0.09645 = 0.89645.

1 - 0.89645 = 0.10355.

So yes, the fractional dip is about 10.355%.

So the planet radius needed is sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218 Rstar.

Looking at the options, D is 0.32, which matches.

So the answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the flux changes caused by the star's dark spots and compare them to the flux reduction caused by a planet transit.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is spotty, with a filling factor of \( 0.2 \) (20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots).
   - Temperature of the spots: \( T_{\text{spot}} = T_{\text{eff}} - 1000 \, \text{K} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Flux Calculations**:
   - The total flux from the star when the unspotted hemisphere is visible (\( F_0 \)) is:
     \[
     F_0 = 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4
     \]
   - When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux (\( F_1 \)) is the sum of the flux from the unspotted regions and the spotted regions:
     \[
     F_1 = 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \left[ 0.8 (6000)^4 + 0.2 (5000)^4 \right]
     \]
   - The fractional change in flux is:
     \[
     \frac{F_0 - F_1}{F_0} = 1 - \frac{F_1}{F_0} = 1 - \left[ 0.8 + 0.2 \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right]
     \]
   - Compute \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \):
     \[
     \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 = \frac{625}{1296} \approx 0.482253
     \]
   - Substituting:
     \[
     \frac{F_0 - F_1}{F_0} = 1 - \left[ 0.8 + 0.2 (0.482253) \right] = 1 - \left[ 0.8 + 0.09645 \right] = 1 - 0.89645 = 0.10355
     \]
   - The fractional dip in flux is approximately \( 0.10355 \) (10.355%).

3. **Exoplanet Transit**:
   - The fractional flux reduction caused by a planet transit is proportional to the area blocked:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
     \]
   - Setting this equal to the fractional dip caused by the spots:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10355
     \]
   - Solving for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star is approximately \( 0.32 \). This matches option **D**.
