Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question involves a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and they're looking at their interaction's developmental fate. So, I think it involves some kind of reporter system or maybe a construct used to track their expression.

The construct is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. I remember bicistronic vectors have two coding regions (so two genes) in one construct. The vector here has the ligand's ORF (which is the coding sequence) at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. Then, the receptor's ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So, the ligand is first, then the receptor.

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think CBA is a strong promoter, maybe constitutively active. The receptor is after an IRES element. IRES is involved in internal ribosome entry sites, which allows for the translation of a separate coding sequence without a full stop. So, the CBA promoter drives the ligand, and the IRES drives the receptor. So the construct is ligand (CBA promoter) -> IRES -> receptor.

Now, looking at the stop cassettes. Between the ligand and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272. I think these are stop signals that prevent expression unless the cassettes are excised by Cre.

So when Cre is present, it would recognize the loxP sites and excise the stop cassette, allowing the downstream gene to be expressed. But the lox2272 is a variant that I'm not entirely sure about. I think lox2272 is a Cre recognition site that's compatible with loxP, but maybe it's used for different recombination events, like in older Cre systems or something. Or perhaps it's used in a way that the same Cre can't cut both cassettes at the same time.

Wait, the vector uses two different lox sites: loxP and lox2272. So, if a cell has Cre, it will cut the loxP sites but not lox2272? Or maybe the other way around. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, maybe the Cre used is specific for one type. For example, wild-type Cre can recognize loxP sites but not lox2272. Or maybe the other way around. I think that lox2272 is a variant that can be used for different purposes, like preventing recombination until a certain condition is met. Hmm.

The setup continues: they made a mouse model that's homozygous for this construct in the wild-type background. Then they crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So, SOX10-Cre would express Cre under the control of SOX10 promoter, meaning Cre would be active in neural crest-derived cells, like astrocytes perhaps.

After the offspring are born, they're visualized under a confocal microscope looking for green signal, which should come from eGFP. But they don't see any green. So, the eGFP isn't being expressed.

The question is why. Let's look at the options.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about the expression of eGFP. Not sure how this ties in. Maybe if the ligand is secreted, but the construct might not express it. Not the first thought.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. The eGFP is on the receptor, which is a transmembrane protein. If it's stuck in Golgi, it won't reach the cell surface, so you won't see the fluorescence. But why would that happen? Maybe the construct's signal peptide is missing or something. But the question says the vector is designed correctly. So perhaps, but not sure.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is strong. The receptor is under IRES, which doesn't require a promoter because it's after the CBA-driven transcript. So if the promoter is missing, but the ligand's promoter is CBA, which is present, maybe not. Unless the IRES isn't functional without a certain enhancer. Not sure; the question says the ligand is under CBA, which is strong.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Oh, this is about whether the ORFs are in the same reading frame. The vector has the receptor ORF at the 3' and eGFP is fused to the C-terminus. So when the receptor is expressed, the eGFP should be a tag at the end. If it's not in frame, the eGFP won't be expressed properly. Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette wasn't removed, so the receptor isn't expressed at all.

Wait, the stop cassettes are between the ligand and mCherry (loxP) and receptor and eGFP (lox2272). So with Cre, it should excise the loxP cassette, allowing mCherry to be expressed downstream of the ligand. Similarly, if the lox2272 is excised, eGFP would be expressed after the receptor.

But in the experiment, they used SOX10-Cre. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so the Cre would be active there. So in the offspring, the construct should have the Cre recombination, which would excise the stop cassettes.

Wait, but the vector is homozygous. So in the mouse, each allele would have the construct. When Cre is introduced, it would recombine both alleles.

So in the offspring, after Cre is active, the stop cassettes should be removed, allowing the ligand (mCherry) and receptor (eGFP) to be expressed.

But in the Western blot using the antibodies, they don't see eGFP. Hmm.

Wait, the question says that after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture, they use the antibodies. But when they made the mouse model, they crossed it to SOX10-Cre. So perhaps the issue is with the vector's design in the mouse.

Wait, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the lox2272 cassette wasn't properly excised. So the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

But why wouldn't the Cre work? Because SOX10-Cre is supposed to express Cre in neural crest-derived cells. So if the Cre isn't active, the stop remains.

Alternatively, perhaps the Cre used is a different strain. Wait, the vector uses loxP and lox2272. I think lox2272 is a variant that requires Cre but doesn't allow recombination with loxP. Or perhaps the Cre can't recognize lox2272.

Wait, lox2272 is a lox variant that is only recognized by Cre when the Cre is in a specific conformation. Or maybe it's a lox site that is only cut by a Cre variant that can't cut loxP. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Wait, loxP has two 34bp repeats, and lox2272 has a different sequence, so maybe Cre can't recognize it. Or maybe it's the other way around. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, I remember that loxP is the standard site for Cre-mediated recombination. Lox2272 is a mutant version that can be used in combination with loxP in a way that allows for the same Cre to recombine both. But perhaps the presence of lox2272 requires a different Cre version or maybe it's not recombined under certain conditions.

Wait, another thought: the loxP and lox2272 are in opposite orientations. So, if you have a loxP site upstream and a lox2272 downstream, Cre might not recombine between them unless the sites are arranged in a certain way. I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 cassette is not excised because the Cre is not active in the cells where the receptor is expressed. So if the Cre is active only in certain cells, but the receptor is expressed elsewhere.

Wait, but the mouse is crossed to SOX10-Cre, which is supposed to express Cre in neural crest cells, which are the same cells where the receptor is expressed. So the Cre should be active there, excising both stop cassettes.

Wait, but the vector is bicistronic, with the ligand first. So in the same cell, both ligand and receptor should be expressed, allowing them to interact.

If the eGFP isn't expressed, perhaps the stop cassette after the receptor is not being excised. Why would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 site isn't recognized by the Cre used. So the Cre can't cut lox2272, leaving the stop cassette in place, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but earlier I thought that lox2272 is recognized by Cre. Or is it that Cre can't cut lox2272?

Wait, from what I remember, lox2272 is a variant that is essentially a loxP site in which the two repeats are arranged in a way that allows for efficient recombination with another loxP site in a different orientation. Or perhaps, the lox2272 is a pseudo-lox, which can't be recombined by Cre unless in combination with another lox site.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 is a lox site that can't be excised by Cre. So if the stop cassette after the receptor is in lox2272, and the Cre can't cut that, the stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

So, if the mouse is homozygous for the construct, and when crossed with SOX10-Cre, which delivers Cre into neural crest cells, the Cre would only excise the loxP site, but not the lox2272.

So the ligand would be expressed (mCherry would be visible if the loxP was excised), but the receptor's stop would remain, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But wait, the question is about the visualization post-crossing; they used confocal and didn't see green. So eGFP isn't expressed.

So why? If the Cre didn't remove the lox2272 stop cassette, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

But why would the Cre not remove it? Because it's using a different lox site.

Wait, maybe the vector in the mouse is such that both stop cassettes are loxP and lox2272. When Cre is introduced, it can only recombine loxP, not lox2272. So the loxP cassette (between ligand and mCherry) is excised, so mCherry is expressed. But the lox2272 cassette (after the receptor) isn't excised, so the receptor-eGFP isn't expressed.

So in the mouse, after Cre expression, the ligand is expressed with mCherry, but the receptor's eGFP isn't expressed because the stop cassette remains.

But in the setup, the question is about the eGFP not being visible in the offspring. So that would explain why eGFP isn't expressed.

Which option aligns with this? Looking at options:

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop remained, then the receptor-eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But that would be because the stop was not excised, not because of frame issues.

Option C says enhancer missing. But the ligand's promoter is CBA, which should be strong.

Option B: the receptor is stuck in Golgi. If it's stuck, then eGFP wouldn't be on the surface. But the problem is that the construct isn't expressed, so no eGFP.

Wait, but the Western blot was done after transfection to astrocytes. The authors used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. If the construct wasn't being expressed, they wouldn't see a band. But the question says the blot gives a signal proportional to actin, meaning the proteins were loaded correctly. But did they see the expected bands?

The question doesn't specify the blot results, but perhaps in the mouse model, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is with the vector not allowing the receptor + eGFP to be expressed.

So perhaps the issue is that the lox2272 stop isn't being excised because the Cre isn't recognizing it, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Which option points to this? None of the options directly say that. Let me look again.

The options are:

A) ligand and receptor are paracrine.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi.

C) Enhancer missing.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the IRES element wasn't working. The receptor is after an IRES. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor won't be translated regardless of the stop cassettes. But the ligand is under CBA, so it's expressed.

Wait, but in the construct, the ligand is first, so it's under the CBA promoter. The IRES is after the ligand, and then the receptor. So the CBA promoter would drive the expression of the ligand, and the IRES would allow for the expression of the receptor.

But if the IRES doesn't function, then the receptor wouldn't be expressed. So perhaps the issue is the IRES isn't working. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not in frame. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't correctly expressed because the ORF is not in frame, leading to a premature stop codon or no expression.

Wait, but the vector is designed so that the receptor and eGFP are in frame. If they aren't, then eGFP won't be expressed correctly. So option D says that.

In the case where the stop cassettes are not properly excised (like the lox2272 stop remains), the receptor-eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But that's about recombination, not the frame.

So I'm a bit stuck between options B, D, and maybe C.

Wait, the question says that the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So the two cassettes are under the same promoter? No, the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is after the IRES. So the CBA promoter drives the expression of the ligand, and the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed from the same transcript.

But perhaps the stop cassettes are causing the issue. If the lox2272 isn't excised, the eGFP is not expressed.

But the main issue is why the eGFP isn't expressed. The possible answers are about the expression construct's design.

If the stop cassettes were not excised, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But why? Because the Cre didn't cut the lox2272 site.

Wait, if the lox2272 site isn't recognized by the Cre, the stop remains. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question says that in the mouse model, they crossed it with SOX10-Cre. The SOX10 promoter drives Cre in neural crest cells. So in those cells, Cre is active, but if the stop cassette is lox2272 and Cre can't cut that, then the stop remains.

But does Cre recognize lox2272?

From what I remember, lox2272 is a variant of the loxP site. It can recombine with loxP in a specific way, but it's a variant that might not be recognized by standard Cre. Or perhaps it's the same as loxP. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I think that lox2272 is a loxP variant that is not recognized by Cre unless in specific conditions, perhaps with a different Cre (like a Cre variant). Or maybe the standard Cre can't recombine lox2272.

If that's the case, then the loxP stop cassette (after ligand) would be excised by Cre, allowing mCherry to be expressed, but the lox2272 cassette (after receptor) would not be excised, so the receptor and eGFP wouldn't be expressed. So the mouse would express mCherry but not eGFP.

But the question is about the eGFP not being expressed. So that would mean the stop after the receptor isn't excised, preventing eGFP expression.

But why? Because the lox2272 isn't recognized by Cre, so the stop remains.

But the options don't directly address this. The closest would be option D, which talks about the frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is not working. But the question states that the IRES is present, which is a way to drive the receptor expression.

Wait, another angle: the presence of two stop cassettes. The ligand's stop is under loxP, and the receptor's under lox2272. So in the mouse, when Cre is introduced, it can only cut loxP, not lox2272. So ligand is expressed (mCherry is expressed after loxP is cut), and the receptor is not (because lox2272 isn't cut, so the stop remains).

So the eGFP isn't expressed, which is why they don't see green. But the question is about why.

So the issue is that the lox2272 stop isn't being excised, so the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed.

But which option aligns with this? None of the options directly address the Cre's inability to cut the lox2272 site.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed so that both stops are the same, but the reporter is only in one. But no, the setup is that each stop is a different lox.

Alternatively, maybe the IRES is upstream of the receptor, but the stop is after the receptor, so the IRES-driven expression is blocked by the stop.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not in frame, making it not expressed. But that's option D.

Wait, another thought: the vectors have two separate stop cassettes. The ligand is under CBA, so the first stop is loxP. The IRES is after the ligand, then the receptor, then the lox2272 stop. So for the receptor to be expressed, both the IRES must function and the lox2272 must be cut.

If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor isn't expressed regardless of the lox2272.

But the question doesn't mention any issues with the IRES. The problem is about the eGFP not being expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is functional, but the lox2272 stop isn't cut, so the receptor isn't expressed.

Wait, but I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible reasons for eGFP not being expressed.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the ORF isn't in frame, the eGFP won't be expressed. But the vector should have been designed correctly.

Option B: the construct is stuck in the Golgi. That would mean the eGFP is expressed but not at the cell surface. But the question says no green signal, which could be either no expression or expression but not visible.

But the Western blot was done on total proteins, and the signal was proportional to actin. So they should see the eGFP in the blot if it's expressed. But if it's stuck in Golgi, it would be present in the lysate. So why isn't there a green signal under the microscope? Because it's not on the surface, maybe. But the question says they don't see a green signal. So it's possible the eGFP isn't expressed.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the SOX10-Cre isn't active in the cells expressing the receptor. But SOX10 is a neural crest marker, and the receptor is expressed in neural crest cells, so perhaps Cre is active there.

Wait, perhaps the Cre used is a floxed allele but the construct requires a different site. Or maybe the lox sites are in the wrong orientation.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox sites are in the same orientation, so recombination isn't possible. But I'm not certain about that.

Hmm. Maybe the reason is that the eGFP is not in frame, so it isn't expressed. So option D would be the answer.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, the issue could be that the enhancer for the receptor's expression is missing. But the receptor is under the IRES, which is after the CBA promoter, which is strong. So perhaps the enhancer isn't needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 site isn't being cut because of the Cre's properties. If the Cre can't cut lox2272, then the stop remains. But none of the options directly address that.

Wait, another point: the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector, which suggests that it's designed to have two cassettes that can be conditionally expressed. So the ligand would be expressed under CBA, but the receptor only when Cre is present. But in the mouse, they're crossed to SOX10-Cre, so the Cre should be active in the same cell types where the receptor is expressed.

But perhaps the vector is designed so that only the loxP stop is cut, and the lox2272 isn't. Thus, the ligand's mCherry is expressed, but the receptor's eGFP isn't.

In this scenario, the problem is that the lox2272 isn't cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

But which option explains this? The answer would be that the receptor and eGFP are not expressed because the stop wasn't removed.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, but if the stop is in place, the receptor and eGFP wouldn't be expressed. So the problem is the stop remains, not frame.

Alternatively, if the frame is wrong, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed even if the stop is removed. So in the mouse, the stop is removed by Cre (if lox2272 is cut), but the eGFP isn't in frame.

So why wouldn't it be in frame? Because the vector design was wrong. So option D is the reason.

But I'm not 100% confident. Another thought: the IRES is after the ligand, so the same transcript is used for both. The ligand is first, then the IRES, then the receptor. So if the IRES isn't working, the receptor isn't expressed. But the question says the ligand is under CBA, which suggests it's expressed.

Wait, but the question says the vector is a bicistronic vector with the ligand under CBA and the receptor under IRES. So if the IRES is functional, the receptor should be expressed. But if the lox2272 stop isn't cut, the receptor isn't expressed.

Assuming the vector is correctly designed, the problem must be with the lox2272 not being excised.

But the options don't directly address that. So perhaps the answer is D, the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Alternatively, maybe the stop cassettes are in a way that both are loxP, but the vector uses different types. Or perhaps the Cre used is not the right type to cut both.

Wait, perhaps the construct has the ligand and mCherry in a loxP cassette, and the receptor and eGFP in a lox2272 cassette. So when Cre is introduced, only the loxP cassette is cut, but the lox2272 remains. So the ligand is expressed, but the receptor's expression is blocked.

So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop wasn't removed.

But why would the lox2272 not be cut? Because the Cre can't recognize it. So the answer would be that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop wasn't removed, but the options don't directly state that.

Hmm. Another angle: in the mouse model, the construct is homozygous. So each allele has the same construct. But the Cre is hemizygous (from SOX10-Cre). So perhaps Cre is only active in one allele, but not both. But that wouldn't prevent expression from both alleles, would it? Or maybe homozygous constructs require Cre to act on both alleles, but if Cre is insufficient, perhaps both stops aren't cut.

But this is getting too speculative.

I think the most plausible answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop is properly excised, but the ORF is out of frame, then eGFP wouldn't be expressed correctly.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand and receptor pair in neural crest-derived cells. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is downstream of an IRES element. The construct includes stop cassettes: a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between the ligand and mCherry, and a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette between the receptor and eGFP. The mouse model is crossed with SOX10-Cre mice to activate Cre in neural crest-derived cells, but no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option is irrelevant to the question, as the issue is about the lack of eGFP expression, not the mode of interaction between the ligand and receptor.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, eGFP would still be present in the cell but not on the surface. However, the question specifies no green signal, suggesting that eGFP is not being expressed at all. This makes this option less likely.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, and the receptor is downstream of an IRES element, which should allow its expression. There is no indication that an enhancer is missing, and this does not directly explain the lack of eGFP expression.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   If the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, eGFP would not be expressed correctly, even if the stop cassette were excised. This could explain the lack of fluorescence. Additionally, the issue could also be due to the lox2272 stop cassette not being excised by Cre, leaving the stop signal intact and preventing receptor-eGFP expression. However, the question does not explicitly address the Cre recognition of lox2272, making this option the most plausible explanation based on the provided information.

### Conclusion:
The most likely reason for the absence of the green signal is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame, preventing proper expression of eGFP.

**Answer: D**
