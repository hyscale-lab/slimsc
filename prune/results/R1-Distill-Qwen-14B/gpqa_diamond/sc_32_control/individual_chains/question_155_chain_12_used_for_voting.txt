Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the uncertainty in P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. Let me try to think through this step by step. 

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable, like P_z, when the system is in a state that's not an eigenstate of the corresponding operator, is given by the square root of the expectation value of the square minus the square of the expectation value. The formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

So, to find this, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. But wait, the system is in a state that's an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So, I can't directly say anything about P_z's expectation without calculating it from the given state.

The given state is a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me write that down. So the state vector is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

Next, I need to find ⟨P_z⟩ which is the expectation value of P_z in this state. The expectation value is given by ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩. Since P_z is a matrix, I can compute this by multiplying the vector with P_z and then taking the dot product with the conjugate transpose of the vector.

Wait, but what's the matrix form of P_z? From the problem statement, P_z has components: first row is [ħ, 0, 0], second row [0,0,0], third row [0,0,-ħ]. So the matrix looks like:

[ ħ    0     0   ]
[ 0    0     0   ]
[ 0    0   -ħ   ]

So P_z is a diagonal matrix. That should make calculations easier because multiplying by a diagonal matrix is just scaling the components.

So, let me compute ⟨P_z⟩. The state vector is [a; b; c] where a=-1/2, b=1/√2, c=-1/2. So,

⟨P_z⟩ = a* * (P_z)_11 * a + b* (P_z)_22 * b + c* (P_z)_33 * c.

But wait, since the basis vectors are eigenstates of P_z, I think the state vector is expressed in that basis. So the components are already in the eigenbasis of P_z. Therefore, the expectation value is just the sum of the probabilities times their corresponding eigenvalues.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The expectation value is ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩. So each component is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.

Alternatively, since P_z is diagonal, P_z |ψ⟩ will be a vector where each component is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element. Then, taking the inner product with ⟨ψ|.

So, let's compute P_z |ψ⟩. The first component is ħ * (-1/2), second is 0 * (1/√2) = 0, third is (-ħ) * (-1/2). So P_z |ψ⟩ = [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T.

Now, the inner product ⟨ψ | P_z |ψ⟩ is the conjugate transpose of [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ] multiplied by [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ].

Wait, but all the components are real here. So, the inner product is (-1/2)(-ħ/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(ħ/2).

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/2)(ħ/2) = ħ/4.

Second term: 0.

Third term: (-1/2)(ħ/2) = -ħ/4.

Adding them: ħ/4 - ħ/4 = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the expectation value of P_z is zero. 

Next, I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z² is just each diagonal element squared. So P_z² has diagonal entries (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2. So, P_z² is:

[ ħ²   0      0   ]
[ 0    0      0   ]
[ 0    0    ħ²   ]

So, when I compute ⟨P_z²⟩, it's the same as ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩.

Again, since P_z² is diagonal, P_z² |ψ⟩ is [ ħ² * (-1/2), 0, ħ² * (-1/2) ]^T. Wait no, wait: no, third component would be (-ħ)^2 * (-1/2) = ħ² * (-1/2). Wait, no: P_z² is (ħ)^2 for first, 0 for second, (ħ)^2 for third. So the third component is (ħ)^2 * (-1/2).

Wait, let me compute P_z² |ψ⟩:

First component: ħ² * (-1/2).

Second component: 0 * (1/√2) = 0.

Third component: (ħ)^2 * (-1/2).

So P_z² |ψ⟩ = [ (-ħ²/2), 0, (-ħ²/2) ]^T.

Now, compute ⟨ψ | P_z² |ψ⟩:

⟨ψ| is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

So the inner product is:

(-1/2)(-ħ²/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(-ħ²/2).

Each term:

First term: (1/2)(ħ²/2) = ħ²/(4).

Third term: (1/2)(ħ²/2) = ħ²/(4).

Adding them: ħ²/4 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is ħ²/2.

Now, the variance is ⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2 = (ħ²/2) - 0 = ħ²/2.

The uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of the variance. So sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = (ħ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which matches this result.

So the answer should be B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix form of $P_z$ is diagonal:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle.
\]

Since $P_z$ is diagonal, the computation simplifies to:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(\hbar) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(-\hbar).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = -\frac{\hbar}{2} + 0 + \frac{\hbar}{2} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix form of $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z^2 | \psi \rangle.
\]

Again, since $P_z^2$ is diagonal, the computation simplifies to:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 (\hbar^2) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 (0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 (\hbar^2).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Uncertainty $\Delta P_z$
The variance of $P_z$ is:

\[
\text{Variance} = \langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

The uncertainty is the square root of the variance:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
