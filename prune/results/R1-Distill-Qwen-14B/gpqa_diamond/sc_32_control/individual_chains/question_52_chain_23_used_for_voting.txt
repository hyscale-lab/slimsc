Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it correctly.

So, there's this star with certain characteristics: 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å, which I remember is in the near-ultraviolet or maybe the far-UV, but I'm not sure if that matters here.

They mention that the photosphere is in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann equation for this. The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature. The equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(kT) ), where g's are the statistical weights and E's are the energies of the levels.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms, so we're considering the same species. The transition wavelength here is 1448 Å. Hmm, I think that's in the vacuum UV, which is why it's not something we see with the naked eye but is important in stellar spectroscopy.

So when the star doesn't have spots, the effective temperature is 6000 K. When spots cover 40% of the surface, the overall Teff is 5500 K. But wait, how does the presence of spots affect the overall temperature? I think that when a star has spots, it's usually because the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So the spots are darker because they emit less light. But the overall effective temperature is given as 5500 K when 40% of the surface is spotted.

Wait, but when the star has spots, the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is lower. So I guess the 5500 K is the new effective temperature. So the Boltzmann factor depends on the temperature of the photosphere where the Ti atoms are.

But wait, the problem is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio depends on the temperature of the region where the atoms are. So when the star's overall temperature is lower, the ratio changes.

So, the ratio is n1/n2 when no spots, and (n1'/n2') when spots are present. The question says that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when spots are present, the ratio is lower.

Wait, the ratio is either n1/n2 or n2/n1. The question states that the ratio decreases when there are spots. So let's think: without spots, Teff is higher, so the ratio is higher. So when Teff increases, the ratio increases (or decreases, depending on which level is higher in energy).

Wait, let's clarify: the Boltzmann equation says that the ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ). If E2 > E1, which it usually is, then as T increases, the exponential increases because the denominator is k T. So n2/n1 increases with T.

But the question is about the ratio being observed to decrease when the star has spots. So, if when spots are present (T is 5500 K), the ratio is lower than when T is 6000 K. So what is the ratio? Are they talking about n1/n2 or n2/n1?

Wait, the problem says: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)". Without specific order, it's ambiguous. But in most cases, level 2 is higher than level 1. So the ratio n2/n1 would be the usual case.

So, when the star has spots, T_eff is lower, so n2/n1 would be lower. So the question is: when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher than when it does. So the factor would be (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.

Wait, no. The problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So if the ratio is n1/n2, then when T goes up, n1/n2 would go down, because n2 increases relative to n1.

Alternatively, if the ratio is n2/n1, then when T increases, n2/n1 increases. So the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, meaning when T is lower. So if the ratio is n2/n1, when T decreases, the ratio decreases. So that fits.

So the ratio in question is n2/n1. Because when T is higher (no spots), the ratio is higher. When T is lower (spots), the ratio is lower. So the problem is asking for (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500. Because when spots are present, the ratio is lower, the factor would be the ratio when no spots / ratio when spots.

So the factor is (n2/n1)_6000 divided by (n2/n1)_5500.

So I can write the ratio as (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ). Since g2/g1 is a constant, the ratio of the ratios would be [ exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ].

Wait, let's be precise. Let me denote T1 as 6000 K (no spots) and T2 as 5500 K (spots).

So (n2/n1)_T1 / (n2/n1)_T2 = [ exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T1) ) / (g2/g1) ) ] / [ exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T2) ) / (g2/g1) ) ]

Wait, but g2/g1 is the same in both cases, so when we take the ratio, g2/g1 cancels out. So the factor is exp( [ (E2-E1)/(k T2) - (E2-E1)/(k T1) ] )

Because [ exp(a) / exp(b) ] = exp(a-b).

So factor = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

But wait, E2 - E1 is related to the photon energy. Since the transition corresponds to wavelength 1448 Å, that's a photon with energy E = hc/λ. So E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

So let's compute that.

h is Planck's constant, which is about 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, ~3e8 m/s. λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So E = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) ≈ let's compute that.

6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ approximately 1.373e-18 J.

Hmm, but 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J, so E ≈ 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ approx 8.57 eV. So E is about 8.57 eV.

Wait, but more accurately, let me compute that.

(6.626e-34 * 3e8) = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = 1.9878e-25 /1.448e-7 ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So eV = (1.373e-18) / (1.602e-19) ≈ 8.57 eV.

So E2 - E1 is approximately 8.57 eV.

But in the Boltzmann factor, the energy is in terms of kT. So we can compute (E2-E1)/(k T).

k is Boltzmann's constant, which is about 8.617e-5 eV/K.

Wait, because k is 1.38e-23 J/K, but when working in eV, it's about 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So for each temperature, compute (E2-E1)/(k T).

So for T1 = 6000 K, (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K) = 8.57 / (8.617e-5 *6000)

Compute denominator: 8.617e-5 *6e3 = 8.617e-5 *6e3 = 8.617 * 6e-2 ≈ 0.517.

So 8.57 / 0.517 ≈ 16.57 ≈ 16.6.

Similarly for T2 =5500 K: 8.57 / (8.617e-5 *5500) → denominator is 8.617e-5 *5.5e3 = 8.617 *5.5e-2 ≈ 0.4739.

8.57 / 0.4739 ≈ 18.1.

So back to (E2-E1)/(k T2) - (E2-E1)/(k T1) )= 18.1 -16.57 = 1.53.

Wait wait, no, the factor is (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ]

Wait, let's compute 1/T2 and 1/T1.

1/T1 =1/6000 ≈ 0.0001667 K^-1.

1/T2 =1/5500≈ 0.0001818 K^-1.

So the difference is 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.0000151 K^-1.

Multiply by (E2-E1)/k: (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 100,000 level? Wait, 8.57 / 8.617e-5 = approx 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ let's compute.

8.57 / 0.00008617 = 8.57 * (1 / 8.617e-5) ≈ 8.57 * 11600 ≈ approx 8.57 *1.16e4.

Wait, 8 *1.16e4 is about 9.28e4, and 0.57*1.16e4≈6.6e3, so total ≈ 9.28e4 +6.6e3≈ 9.94e4 ≈ 99,400.

So (E2-E1)/(k) ≈ 99,400 K.

So then multiply by (1/T2 - 1/T1): 99,400 K * (0.0000151 K^-1) = 99,400 * 0.0000151 ≈ 1.502.

So the exponent is approximately 1.502.

So the factor is exp(1.502) ≈ e^1.5 is about 4.48. Because e^1 is 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.48.

Wait, more accurately: e^1.5 is e^(3/2) ≈ sqrt(e^3) ≈ sqrt(20.085) ≈ 4.4817.

So the factor is about 4.48, which is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options: option C is ~4.5.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately 4.5. So the answer should be option C.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_2/g_1 \) is the statistical weight ratio, \( E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The problem specifies that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, so the energy difference is calculated as:

\[
E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \). Substituting these values:

\[
E_2 - E_1 = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
E_2 - E_1 \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Next, the ratio of the number of atoms in the two energy levels depends on the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
\]

where \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) (no spots) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \) (spots). Substituting \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \):

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} = \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99,400 \, \text{K}.
\]

Now, calculate \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \):

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.0000151 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(99,400 \times 0.0000151\right) = \exp(1.502).
\]

Using \( \exp(1.502) \approx 4.48 \), the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately 4.5. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
