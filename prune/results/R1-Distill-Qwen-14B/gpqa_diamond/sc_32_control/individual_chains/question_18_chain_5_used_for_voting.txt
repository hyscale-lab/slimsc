Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

So, the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I'm not sure if the masses matter here. Maybe the problem is more about the abundances. Oh right, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. 

They've given me some abundance ratios using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width, a method to determine elemental abundance in stellar spectra. The data given is:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Wait, let me make sure I understand what these brackets mean. The notation [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of the number density of X to Y relative to the Sun's photosphere. So, [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_Sun. Or wait, another way: [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So if [Si/Fe] is 0.3, that means in Star_1, the ratio of Si to Fe is higher than the Sun by a factor of 10^0.3.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

Wait, let me parse that. So for the Sun:

For Fe, 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12= -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg, log(nMg/nH) =7 -12= -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5).

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. The Sun's composition is given as 12 + log10(nX/nH) equals some number. So:

nFe/nH = 10^((7.5 -12) ) =10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5?

And for Mg, log10(nMg/nH) = (7 -12) = -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

Hmm, but wait, maybe I should think in terms of number densities relative to H.

So, the problem is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star 1 and Star 2. So, (nSi_1 / nSi_2).

How do I approach this?

Let me list the given data:

For Star_1:
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → which means the metallicity is the same as the Sun. So [Fe/H] means [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun. Since [Fe/H] is 0, log(nFe/nH)_1 = log(nFe/nH)_sun. So nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Wait, but nH is the number of hydrogen atoms. So if [Fe/H] is zero, that implies that the star has the same Fe abundance relative to H as the Sun. So the overall metallicity isn't different, but maybe the ratios of other elements to Fe are different.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → same as Sun for Mg abundance. So nMg_2/nH_2 =nMg_sun /nH_sun.

So, for Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 - log(nSi/nFe)_sun =0.3 → nSi_1/nFe_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) 

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg/nSi)_2 - log(nMg/nSi)_sun =0.3 → nMg_2/nSi_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun)

Wait, but I need the ratio nSi_1 /nSi_2.

Hmm, perhaps I should express nSi_1 and nSi_2 in terms of the Sun's composition.

Let me start with Star_1.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe_1 /nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → [Si/Fe] is log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi/nFe)_sun =0.3 → nSi/nFe = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

Wait, wait, let me think about this. The [X/Y] notation is defined as log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So if [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, then log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3.

So nSi_1/nFe_1 = 10^(log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3) = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

But nFe_1 is equal to nFe_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun) → because [Fe/H] is zero, so nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe_1 = nFe_sun*(nH_1/nH_sun).

Wait, but I don't know the ratio of nH_1 to nH_sun. Oh wait, but since the stars are considered to have the same total number of particles as the Sun? Or is that not necessarily the case?

Wait, the problem says to assume LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), but I'm not sure if that impacts the number density ratios. Maybe not directly. So perhaps I can proceed by expressing everything relative to the Sun.

Let me think in terms of ratios.

For Star_1:

nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun) → because [Fe/H] =0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun) )

Similarly, for [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun)

Substituting nFe_1:

nSi_1 = (nFe_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun)) ) * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun )

Simplify:

nSi_1 = (nH_1 /nH_sun) * 10^0.3 * nSi_sun

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3 → nMg_2/nSi_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )

Also, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun )

So substituting into the Mg/Si ratio:

nMg_2/nSi_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )

→ (nMg_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun )) ) / nSi_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )

Cancel nMg_sun from both sides:

(nH_2 /nH_sun ) / nSi_2 = 10^0.3 /nSi_sun

→ nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun / 10^0.3 )

So,

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun ) / 10^0.3

Now, I need to find the ratio nSi_1 /nSi_2.

So,

nSi_1 /nSi_2 = [ (nH_1 /nH_sun ) * 10^0.3 * nSi_sun ] / [ (nH_2 /nH_sun ) * nSi_sun /10^0.3 ) ]

Simplify:

= (nH_1 /nH_sun ) * 10^0.3 * nSi_sun * 10^0.3 / (nH_2 /nH_sun * nSi_sun )

The nSi_sun and (nH_1 /nH_sun ) and (nH_2 /nH_sun ) terms can be processed.

Wait, let me substitute all terms:

= [ (nH_1 /nH_sun ) * 10^0.3 ] / [ (nH_2 /nH_sun ) * (1/10^0.3) ) ]

Because nSi_sun in numerator and denominator cancels. So:

= [ (nH_1 /nH_sun ) * 10^0.3 ] * [ 10^0.3 / (nH_2 /nH_sun ) ) ]

Which is:

= [ (nH_1 /nH_2 ) ) * (10^0.3 * 10^0.3 ) ]

= (nH_1 / nH_2 ) * 10^(0.6)

But wait, I don't have the ratio of nH_1 to nH_2. Hmm, but maybe the stars have the same total number density as the Sun. Because the problem says to assume LTE and using the EW method for elemental abundances. Wait, but maybe not. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the total number of particles is the same for all? Or maybe not. I'm not sure. Or perhaps the ratio of H in the stars is what I need to find.

Wait, but I don't have any data about H in the stars besides what's implied by their [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] values. Let me think.

Wait, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe_1 /nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun → so nH_1 = (nFe_1 * nH_sun ) / nFe_sun.

But nFe_1 is an unknown. Hmm, maybe I can express everything in terms of the Sun's H.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate nH_1 and nH_2 using some other constraints.

Wait, wait, but perhaps the problem allows me to assume that H is the same in both stars as in the Sun? No, that can't be right because otherwise, the stars would have the same composition as the Sun, but they have different masses and different abundances.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So nSi_1 / nSi_2.

From earlier, I derived:

nSi_1 = (nH_1 /nH_sun ) *10^0.3 *nSi_sun

and

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_sun ) *nSi_sun /10^0.3

So, the ratio is:

nSi_1 /nSi_2 = [ (nH_1 /nH_sun ) *10^0.3 *nSi_sun ] / [ (nH_2 /nH_sun ) *nSi_sun /10^0.3 ] 

Simplify:

= (nH_1 /nH_2 ) * (10^0.3 * 10^0.3 ) 
= (nH_1 /nH_2 ) * 10^(0.6)

But I don't know nH_1 /nH_2. How can I find this ratio?

Wait, perhaps I can look for an equation involving H.

Wait, let me consider that the total number of particles in a star's photosphere might be the same as the Sun's. But that's an assumption, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the star and the Sun can help.

Wait, the stars' masses are 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses. But mass is related to the number of particles. Assuming that each star has the same density as the Sun, the number of particles would scale with mass. But I don't know if the stars have the same density as the Sun. Hmm, but the problem doesn't provide any information about the stars' sizes or densities, so perhaps that's not the way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of H can be determined from the abundances given.

Wait, perhaps I can find nH_1 and nH_2 in terms of the Sun's nH_sun and the star's other abundances.

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 /nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun → nH_1 = nFe_1 * (nH_sun /nFe_sun )

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2 /nH_2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun → nH_2 =nMg_2 * (nH_sun /nMg_sun )

But I don't know nFe_1 or nMg_2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can express everything in terms of the Sun's composition and the given ratios.

Wait, let's think about the Sun's composition again.

For the Sun:

nFe_sun /nH_sun = 10^(-4.5) → because 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH= 1e-4.5.

Similarly, nMg_sun /nH_sun = 1e-5 → because 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So, for Star_1:

nFe_1 /nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun → nFe_1 = (nH_1) * (nFe_sun /nH_sun )

Which is nFe_1 = nH_1 * 1e-4.5.

Similarly, for Star_2:

nMg_2 = nH_2 * (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) = nH_2 * 1e-5.

So, going back to nSi_1 and nSi_2:

From earlier, nSi_1 = (nH_1 /nH_sun ) *10^0.3 *nSi_sun

But wait, nSi_sun is the number of silicon atoms in the Sun's photosphere. So, how can I express that?

Wait, the Sun's [Si/Fe] is log(nSi/nFe)_sun - ... Wait, I'm given the Sun's nFe and nMg, but not nSi. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can find [Si/Fe]_sun from the data given. Let's see.

In the Sun:

nFe/nH =1e-4.5.

nSi/nH = ?

Wait, [Si/Fe] is a ratio. So, [Si/Fe]_sun = log(nSi/nFe)_sun - log(nSi/nFe)_sun =0 → no, wait, that can't be. Wait, no, [X/Y] is the logarithm of (n_X/n_Y) in the star minus that in the Sun. So, [X/Y]_sun is zero because it's the same as the Sun.

But in this case, I don't have [Si/Fe]_sun, but perhaps I can compute it.

Wait, wait. The Sun's [Si/Fe] would be determined by the ratio of its nSi to nFe.

We know nFe_sun /nH_sun =1e-4.5.

But what about nSi_sun /nH_sun?

I don't have that data. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the Sun's [Si/Fe] is zero? But that's not correct, as I know that in the Sun, the abundance of Si is higher than Fe, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I can compute [Si/Fe]_sun from the given data.

Wait, the Sun's [Si/Fe] can be found if I know the solar abundances of Si and Fe. But I have only Fe and Mg given.

Wait, perhaps I can get it from the given data of Star_1 and Star_2, but no, that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't require knowing the Sun's [Si/Fe] because it's going to cancel out in the ratio. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can proceed without knowing nSi_sun.

Wait, let me think again about the expressions.

Earlier, I have:

nSi_1 = (nH_1 /nH_sun ) *10^0.3 *nSi_sun

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_sun ) *nSi_sun /10^0.3

So the ratio nSi_1 /nSi_2 = (nH_1 /nH_2 ) * (10^0.3 *10^0.3 ) = (nH_1 /nH_2 ) *10^0.6

But I still don't know nH_1 /nH_2.

Hmm, perhaps I can find another equation involving nH_1 and nH_2.

Wait, perhaps using the fact that the total number of particles in each star is the same as the Sun? Or perhaps not, because the stars have different masses.

Wait, let me think about the total number of particles. The mass of a star is the sum of the contributions from all the elements, each multiplied by their respective atomic weights. But that seems complicated because I don't have all the elements' abundances.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the number of hydrogen atoms is the same in each star as in the Sun. But that's probably not correct, because if a star has more heavy elements, the number of H would be less. Or, wait, if the abundances change, the number of H could change.

Wait, but in the problem, [Fe/H]_1 is zero, which implies that the number of Fe relative to H is the same as the Sun. But that doesn't necessarily fix the number of H.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ratio of H in Star_1 and Star_2 can be determined from their metallicity. But in this case, both have [Fe/H]=0 and [Mg/H]=0, so their metallicities are the same as the Sun. Hmm, but metallicity usually refers to the abundance of elements heavier than He, so perhaps that doesn't directly affect H.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about what I need to find again.

I need nSi_1 /nSi_2.

From the earlier equations, this ratio depends on (nH_1 /nH_2 ) multiplied by 10^0.6.

So, I need to find (nH_1 /nH_2 ).

Wait, perhaps I can relate this to the abundances of other elements.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I can find nH_1 and nH_2 in terms of the Sun's nH_sun.

Wait, for Star_1, because [Fe/H]_1=0, nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun )

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun )

But how does that help me find nH_1 and nH_2?

Wait, perhaps I can use other abundance ratios. Let's see.

Star_1 has [Si/Fe]_1=0.3. So, nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun )

But nFe_1 is nFe_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun )

So,

nSi_1 = (nFe_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun )) *10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun )

= (nH_1 /nH_sun ) * 10^0.3 * nSi_sun 

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → nMg_2 =nSi_2 *10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )

But nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun )

So,

nMg_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun ) =nSi_2 *10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )

Cancel nMg_sun from both sides:

nH_2 /nH_sun = nSi_2 *10^0.3 / (nSi_sun )

So,

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_sun ) * nSi_sun / 10^0.3 

Which is the same as earlier.

But I still don't see how to find nH_1 and nH_2.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the total mass of the star is given, but I don't think that's helpful without knowing the other element abundances.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows me to assume that the ratio nH_1 /nH_2 is 1. But I can't assume that without justification.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem can be solved without knowing nH_1 and nH_2 because they cancel out in the ratio. But from the earlier expression, the ratio nSi_1 /nSi_2 depends on nH_1 /nH_2, which I don't know.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can find nH_1 /nH_2 using the mass of the stars.

Wait, the stars' masses are 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses. If we assume that these stars have the same density as the Sun, then the number of particles (assuming fully ionized and same composition) would scale with mass. But I don't think that's the case because their compositions are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of hydrogen atoms in each star can be found based on the total mass and the average molecular weight.

The number of moles (particles) in a star's photosphere is approximately (mass) / (average molecular weight * m_H), where m_H is the mass of a hydrogen atom.

But to compute that, I need to know the average molecular weight for each star. Without knowing the abundances of all elements, this approach seems impossible.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the H ratio and proceed under the assumption that nH_1 =nH_2 =nH_sun. But that would make the ratio nSi_1 /nSi_2 = (10^0.3 *10^0.3 ) =10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is option A.

But wait, why would nH_1 and nH_2 be the same as the Sun's? Because both stars have the same metallicity as the Sun? Or perhaps the problem is designed so that the H counts are the same, making the ratio only depend on the 10^0.6 factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of H in the two stars is determined by their [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] values. But since both are 0, that implies nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun, and nMg_2/nH_2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun.

But without knowing the total H in each star, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps I can relate the H counts using the mass and the average composition. Let's think.

The mass of a star is roughly the sum of the masses of all elements, each multiplied by their number density and the atomic mass.

But without knowing all the elements, this is impossible. So perhaps the problem is designed to ignore this and just focus on the given ratios.

Wait, perhaps I can proceed by setting nH_1 /nH_sun =1 and nH_2 /nH_sun =1, which would make the ratio nSi_1/nSi_2=10^0.6≈3.98, which is option A.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to realize that nH_1 and nH_2 are the same as the Sun's because [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are zero.

Wait, if [Fe/H] is zero, then nFe_1/nH_1 =nFe_sun/nH_sun. So if nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun ), then if nH_1 =nH_sun, then nFe_1 =nFe_sun. Which would imply that the H count is the same as the Sun's.

But that's not necessarily true because the star could have the same Fe/H ratio but more or less H.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to proceed under the assumption that nH_1 =nH_sun and nH_2 =nH_sun.

Then, the ratio nSi_1 /nSi_2 = 10^(0.6) ≈3.98, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute nH_1 /nH_2 based on the given data.

Wait, let's think: in Star_1, [Fe/H]=0. So nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun )

In Star_2, [Mg/H]=0. So nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun )

But I can relate nFe_1 and nMg_2 through their abundances.

Hmm, but I don't have a direct relation between them. Maybe through another element?

Wait, perhaps if I can find the ratio of nFe_1 to nMg_2, but I don't see a way.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to just compute the ratio of silicon using the given data and without worrying about H, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's express everything in terms of the Sun's H.

Let me compute the ratio of nSi_1 /nSi_2 as:

nSi_1 = (nH_1 /nH_sun ) *10^0.3 *nSi_sun

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_sun ) *nSi_sun /10^0.3

So,

nSi_1/nSi_2 = (nH_1/nH_2) * (10^0.3 * 10^0.3 ) = (nH_1/nH_2) *10^0.6

But I don't know nH_1/nH_2. However, perhaps I can find nH_1 and nH_2 in terms of the Sun's nH_sun.

Wait, for Star_1:

nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun )

And for Star_2:

nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun )

But I don't know nFe_1 and nMg_2, so I can't proceed that way.

Alternatively, if I can express nH_1 and nH_2 in terms of Fe and Mg, but I don't see a way.

Wait, perhaps I can relate nH_1 and nH_2 using another element's abundance. For example, if I had [O/Fe] or something else, but the problem doesn't provide that.

Hmm... I'm stuck. Maybe I should make an assumption to proceed.

Assuming that nH_1 /nH_2 =1, which would mean that the number of H atoms in both stars is the same as the Sun. Then, the ratio nSi_1 /nSi_2 =10^0.6≈3.98, which is option A.

But is there any reason to believe that H counts are the same? Since both stars have [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] equal to zero, perhaps their overall composition is the same as the Sun, implying same H.

But wait, no, because the stars could have different abundances for other elements, like Si, altering the H count.

Wait, but [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are zero, so Fe and Mg abundances are the same as the Sun. But if other elements like Si have different abundances, that would change the H count.

Wait, but in Star_1, [Si/Fe] is higher, which implies more Si relative to Fe. Since Fe is the same as the Sun, that would mean more Si, so nSi_1 is higher, which could imply more heavy elements, so lower nH_1. Hmm, but without knowing how much other heavy elements are present, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the ratio of H is the same as the Sun. So nH_1 =nH_2 =nH_sun.

In that case, the ratio is 10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is option A.

But why would the problem make that assumption? Maybe because the stars have the same metallicity as the Sun, so the H is the same.

Wait, but metallicity is typically [Fe/H], which is zero here. So perhaps the H counts are the same.

In that case, the ratio would be about 3.98, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to ignore the H ratio and focus solely on the given abundance ratios.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the H ratio can be determined from the given data of the stars.

Wait, considering Star_1:

nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun )

But [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1/nH_1 =nFe_sun/nH_sun → so nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun )

Similarly, for Star_2:

nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun )

But without another equation involving nH_1 and nH_2, I can't find their ratio.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the Sun's [Si/Fe] ratio.

Wait, the problem doesn't give the Sun's [Si/Fe] ratio. So perhaps I can calculate it.

Wait, the Sun's [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun =0 → so [X/Y]_sun is zero.

Wait, but that's the definition. So [Si/Fe]_sun =0, meaning nSi_sun/nFe_sun =nSi_sun /nFe_sun =10^0=1.

Wait, but that's not correct because in reality, the Sun's [Fe/H] is about zero, but [Si/Fe] is positive. Wait, but maybe the problem uses a different solar normalization.

Wait, perhaps the problem defines [X/Y] as (log nX/nY) relative to the Sun, so [X/Y]_sun =0.

Wait, if that's the case, then in the Sun:

log(nSi/nFe) =0 → nSi/nFe =1.

But the Sun's nFe/nH is 1e-4.5, and if nSi/nFe =1, then nSi/nH=1e-4.5.

Wait, but earlier, for the Sun, nMg/nH is 1e-5. So, nMg/nH=1e-5, nFe/nH=1e-4.5, and nSi/nH=1e-4.5.

Wait, but that's only possible if the Sun's [Mg/Fe] is log( (1e-5)/(1e-4.5) ) = log(1e-0.5)= -0.5 dex.

So, the Sun's [Mg/Fe] is -0.5.

Wait, but the problem gives Star_2's [Mg/Si]_2=0.3, so perhaps that can help, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed without worrying about the Sun's [Si/Fe] and just work with the given data.

So, perhaps I can proceed by assuming that nH_1 =nH_2 =nH_sun.

Then, the ratio nSi_1/nSi_2 =10^0.6 = approx 3.98.

Wait, 10^0.6 is about 3.98, which is close to option A (~3.9).

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

10^0.6 = 10^(3/5) = (10^0.1)^3 ≈ (1.2589)^3 ≈ 2.0.

Wait, no, wait, 10^0.3 is about 2. But 10^0.6 is about 3.98.

Wait, so 10^0.6 is approximately 3.98.

So, the ratio is about 3.98, which is option A.

But, is that the correct approach? Because the problem doesn't provide any information about the H counts in the stars, I'm making an assumption that nH_1 =nH_2 =nH_sun, which may not be valid.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the H ratio cancels out, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in earlier steps. Let me recheck.

Wait, in the expression for nSi_1 and nSi_2, I have:

nSi_1 = (nH_1 /nH_sun ) *10^0.3 *nSi_sun

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_sun ) *nSi_sun /10^0.3

So, the ratio:

nSi_1 /nSi_2 = (nH_1/nH_2) * (10^0.3 /10^(-0.3)) ) → because 10^0.3 in numerator and (1/10^0.3) in denominator.

So, that's (nH_1/nH_2 ) * (10^0.6).

Which brings me back to the same conclusion. So, I still need (nH_1/nH_2).

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ratio of H in the two stars can be determined by the fact that the mass of the star is proportional to the number of particles, assuming same density.

Wait, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 solar masses, and Star_2 is 1.2 solar masses.

Assuming that the stars have the same density as the Sun, then the number of particles in each star's photosphere would be proportional to their mass.

So, number of particles in Star_1: N_1 =1.5 * N_sun.

Number of particles in Star_2: N_2=1.2 * N_sun.

The total number of particles is the sum of all elements, but since we don't have all the data, perhaps we can assume that H is the main component.

So, the number of H atoms in each star would be proportional to their mass.

So, nH_1 =1.5 *nH_sun,

nH_2=1.2 *nH_sun.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is a valid assumption. The problem says to assume LTE, which may not directly relate to the star's overall density.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the H ratio and just compute the ratio based on the given abundance ratios, leading to option A.

But given the time I've spent, perhaps I should proceed with that.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and use the relationships provided.

### Key Data and Definitions:
1. **Abundance Ratios**:
   - For Star_1:  
     - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex → \( \log(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Fe}})_1 = \log(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Fe}})_{\odot} + 0.3 \)  
     - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex → \( n_{\text{Fe}}_1/n_{\text{H}}_1 = n_{\text{Fe}}_{\odot}/n_{\text{H}}_{\odot} \).  
   - For Star_2:  
     - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex → \( \log(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}})_2 = \log(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}})_{\odot} + 0.3 \)  
     - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex → \( n_{\text{Mg}}_2/n_{\text{H}}_2 = n_{\text{Mg}}_{\odot}/n_{\text{H}}_{\odot} \).

2. **Solar Photospheric Composition**:
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\odot} = 7.5 \) → \( n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\odot} = 10^{-4.5} \).  
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\odot} = 7 \) → \( n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\odot} = 10^{-5} \).  

3. **Relationships for Silicon**:
   - For Star_1:  
     \( n_{\text{Si}}_1 = n_{\text{H}}_1 \cdot 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot}/n_{\text{H}}_{\odot}) \).  
   - For Star_2:  
     \( n_{\text{Si}}_2 = n_{\text{H}}_2 \cdot (n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot}/n_{\text{H}}_{\odot}) \cdot 10^{-0.3} \).  

4. **Ratio of Silicon Atoms**:  
   The ratio of silicon atoms is given by:  
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = \frac{(n_{\text{H}}_1 \cdot 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot}/n_{\text{H}}_{\odot}))}{(n_{\text{H}}_2 \cdot (n_{\text{Si}}_{\odot}/n_{\text{H}}_{\odot}) \cdot 10^{-0.3})} = \frac{n_{\text{H}}_1}{n_{\text{H}}_2} \cdot 10^{0.6}.
   \]

### Simplification and Assumption:
- The problem does not provide explicit data about the ratio \( n_{\text{H}}_1/n_{\text{H}}_2 \). To proceed, we assume that the number of hydrogen atoms in both stars is the same as in the Sun, i.e., \( n_{\text{H}}_1 = n_{\text{H}}_2 = n_{\text{H}}_{\odot} \).  
- Substituting this assumption, the ratio simplifies to:  
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = 10^{0.6}.
  \]

### Calculation:
- \( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \), which is closest to the given option **A (~3.9)**.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
