Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to remember what C3h symmetry means. C3h is a type of molecular symmetry that includes a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So the molecule should look the same after being rotated 120 degrees around the C3 axis and also have a mirror plane that's horizontal, perpendicular to that axis.

Looking at the options, I see four molecules. I'll go through each one by one.

Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. That's a mouthful. Triphenyleno suggests three phenyl groups attached, and a trifuran part. Wait, I think I've heard of this structure before. It's a corannulene derivative or something like that. Wait, no, I think it's the structure where there are three phenyl groups attached to a central fused ring system. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a more symmetrical molecule. The substituents need to be arranged symmetrically.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. So this has a benzo group attached to a trifuran. Benzo implies a benzene ring, right? And trifuran is a three-ring fused system, perhaps. The numbering might suggest that the substituents are in certain positions. I'm not entirely sure about the symmetry here.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. Borate usually has a boron atom with three substituents. Triisopropyl would mean three isopropyl groups attached to boron. Wait, isopropyl groups are themselves symmetrical. So the structure would have three identical substituents around the boron. Boron typically forms trigonal planar structures. So with three isopropyl groups, the molecule should have a trigonal planar geometry. That might give it C3 symmetry, but wait, what about the mirror plane? For C3h, there's also a horizontal mirror. So if the molecule is planar, maybe it has a mirror plane. Alternatively, if the molecule is planar and has three identical substituents, it might not have a horizontal mirror plane but could have a vertical one. Hmm, not sure yet.

Option D: Quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound. Wait, it's a norbornane derivative but with additional rings. Oh wait, quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane structure. So it's a bridgehead structure. Let me think: the structure has a three-dimensional arrangement. The molecule is not planar, so it's less likely to have a mirror plane. Wait, but does it have any symmetry? Quinuclidine's structure is actually a very symmetric molecule. It has a bridge structure with three bridges of two carbons each. So the molecule is symmetric with a three-fold rotation axis? Because looking at it, if you rotate it 120 degrees around an axis that goes through the bridgehead, it should look the same. But whether it has a horizontal mirror plane as well. Wait, mirror planes in 3D structures can be a bit tricky. I'm not entirely certain, but I think quinuclidine has C3 symmetry. Wait, but does it have the σh plane? Or is it just a C3 axis without the mirror plane?

Wait, I think I need to clarify. C3h symmetry requires both a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So for a molecule to have C3h, the rotation plus the mirror must leave it unchanged.

Let me think about each option again.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. The structure is similar to triphenylborate, where three isopropyl groups are attached to boron. Boron is at the center with three identical substituents. The molecule is planar around the boron. So the geometry is trigonal planar. So the symmetry would be D3h, right? Because D3h includes a three-fold rotation, mirror planes, and inversion. Wait, D3h has a lot of symmetry elements. So if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it would have C3h as part of it. Wait, but the options are asking for C3h, not D3h or higher. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule only has C3h symmetry. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. If the molecule is planar and trigonal with three identical substituents, then it has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane (since the molecule is planar, the mirror plane is along the plane of the molecule). So this would give C3h symmetry. So triisopropylborate might have C3h.

But wait, what about the actual structure. Is triisopropylborate planar? Boron compounds with three identical substituents are trigonal planar, so yes, the molecule is planar. So the molecule would have a C3 axis and a σh plane (the plane of the molecule). So that would mean it has C3h symmetry.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure about the exact symmetry. Let me think about the other options.

Option D: Quinuclidine. It's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane structure. It has three bridgeheads. If I imagine the molecule, if you rotate it 120 degrees, it should look the same because all three bridges are identical. So that's the C3 axis. But does it have a σh plane? A horizontal mirror plane would require that the molecule looks the same when reflected over a plane. For quinuclidine, the molecule is symmetric in that way. Wait, perhaps the plane that bisects the molecule through the bridgehead might be a mirror plane. Or maybe not. Alternatively, the molecule might have C3i (inversion) symmetry but not a mirror plane. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the chair conformations of norbornane derivatives. Quinuclidine is a more rigid structure. But I think quinuclidine doesn't have a mirror plane. Because if you look at it, the substituents around might not be symmetric in that way. Alternatively, perhaps it does. I'm not sure. Maybe I should compare the symmetry of each molecule.

Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. I'm not exactly sure about this structure, but the name suggests that it's a trifuran (three fused furan rings) with three phenyl groups attached. The substituents are at positions 1,3,6,8,11,13. Wait, the substituents are on the furan rings. If the phenyl groups are attached in a symmetric way, perhaps the molecule has C3h symmetry. For example, three phenyl groups attached at 120-degree intervals around the central structure. Then, rotating 120 degrees would map each phenyl to another, and with a horizontal mirror plane, it would be symmetric.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran... So a benzo group attached to a trifuran. Wait, benzo implies one benzene ring. So perhaps the substituents are not symmetric. Then, the symmetry might be lower, like C3v or something else, but not C3h.

Wait, so between options A, C, and D.

Option C: Triisopropylborate. If it's planar with three identical substituents, then C3h symmetry.

Option D: Quinuclidine. If it has C3 symmetry but no mirror plane, then it doesn't have C3h.

Option A: If it's a trifuran with three phenyl groups attached symmetrically, perhaps it has C3h.

So how can I determine which one has both a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane?

Another approach: molecules with C3h symmetry include those that are planar and have three identical substituents at 120 degrees apart, like benzene with three substituents at every 120 degrees (like C3H3Cl3). Alternatively, it could be structures like certain tricyclic compounds.

Wait, triphenylene is a planar molecule with three benzene rings connected, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, triphenyleno derivatives might have higher symmetry.

Wait, I think triphenylene itself is a molecule with three benzene rings connected in a symmetric way, but I'm not sure about its substituents.

Alternatively, let's think about each option:

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. The structure is trigonal planar around boron. So, if you imagine looking down the boron, the three isopropyl groups are at 120 degrees. So, the molecule has a C3 axis (rotation 120 degrees) and a σh (mirror) plane perpendicular to the C3 axis (i.e., the plane of the molecule). So yes, it should have C3h symmetry.

Option D: Quinuclidine. The structure is more like a three-dimensional arrangement. It's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a three-fold axis, but does it have a horizontal mirror plane? I'm not certain, but I think quinuclidine has a center of inversion, not a mirror plane. So it might have C3i symmetry, which would mean it's not C3h.

So, between options A, C, and D, the correct one is either A or C.

Wait, let me reconsider option A. Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran... Hmm, that's a mouthful. So it's a trifuran (three fused furan rings) with three phenyl groups attached. The substituents are at positions 1,3,6,8,11,13. So maybe each phenyl is attached at certain positions, but are they symmetric?

Alternatively, the numbering might imply that the phenyl groups are attached in a symmetric fashion around the central structure. For instance, each phenyl is attached to a different ring, spaced 120 degrees apart. In that case, rotating 120 degrees would map each phenyl to the next, and perhaps a mirror plane exists. So this molecule might have C3h symmetry.

But I'm not exactly sure about the structure. Alternatively, perhaps option A is more symmetric.

Wait, but I'm trying to remember examples. Quinuclidine is a very symmetrical molecule but not planar, so perhaps it doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane. Triisopropylborate is planar, so it should have a mirror plane.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option C: triisopropyl borate.

Wait, but I'm now a bit confused because I thought that option D, quinuclidine, is also a symmetric molecule.

Wait, another way: the presence of a horizontal mirror plane in non-planar molecules is possible. For example, ammonia has a horizontal mirror plane in its trigonal pyramidal structure, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, quinuclidine is a bridged bicyclic compound. Its structure is such that there's a three-fold rotation axis, but perhaps it also has a mirror plane. I'm not entirely sure, but I think quinuclidine does have a mirror plane. Let me try to visualize the structure. Quinuclidine has a central carbon with three bridges, each of two carbons. If the molecule is symmetric, then rotating 120 degrees would map each bridge onto another. But for a mirror plane, the molecule should look the same when reflected over a plane. If the molecule is symmetric across a plane that bisects it, then yes, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Quinuclidine is a well-known molecule with high symmetry. Let me think about its symmetry elements. It has a three-fold rotation axis, and possibly a horizontal mirror plane. If that's the case, then it would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, I found conflicting information in my notes. Earlier, I thought that triisopropyl borate would have C3h because it's planar with three identical substituents. But if quinuclidine has a three-fold rotation and a mirror plane, then it would also have C3h.

But I'm not sure which one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Let me think about the substituents again.

Option A: Triphenyleno[...]trifuran. So three phenyl groups attached to a trifuran system. If the three substituents (phenyl groups) are at 120-degree positions around the central structure, then it would have a three-fold rotation and a mirror plane, leading to C3h symmetry.

Wait, but I'm not sure. It's hard to visualize the exact structure.

Alternatively, the correct answer is option B, but I'm not confident.

Wait, let me try another approach. The four options are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

I think triisopropyl borate (option C) is a planar molecule with three identical groups arranged symmetrically, which would give it C3h symmetry. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should think about the molecular geometry.

Triisopropylborate: Boron is in the center, trigonal planar, three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is like a -CH(CH3)2 group. So the structure is planar, and each substituent is at 120 degrees. So rotating 120 degrees would leave the structure the same, and the mirror plane would be the plane of the molecule. So yes, C3h.

Quinuclidine: It's a bridged structure. Looking for a mirror plane. If the molecule is symmetrical, perhaps a vertical plane through the bridgehead carbons could be a mirror plane. But I'm not sure if that's a horizontal mirror. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different plane.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane but has a vertical one, so its symmetry would be D3h or something else.

Wait, I need to clarify the difference between vertical and horizontal mirror planes. In molecular symmetry, the orientation matters. A horizontal mirror plane is perpendicular to the main axis (say, the C3 axis in this case). So, for a planar molecule like triisopropylborate, the plane of the molecule is horizontal, and the mirror is in that plane, which would be a σh plane.

In a non-planar molecule like quinuclidine, a horizontal mirror plane would be one that's perpendicular to the C3 axis and cuts through the molecule. But whether such a plane exists depends on the structure.

I'm starting to think that triisopropylborate (option C) has C3h symmetry. So the answer is option C.

To determine which molecule has **C₃h symmetry**, we analyze the options based on the definition of **C₃h symmetry**, which includes a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ). The molecule must look the same after a 120° rotation around the C₃ axis and must be symmetric with respect to the horizontal mirror plane.

### Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
This molecule consists of a trifuran core (three fused furan rings) with three phenyl groups attached. The numbering suggests that the phenyl groups are positioned symmetrically at 120° intervals around the central structure. If the substituents are arranged in a symmetric manner, the molecule would have a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ), making it a candidate for **C₃h symmetry**. However, the exact structure is complex, and the symmetry depends on the precise arrangement of the phenyl groups, which is unclear from the name alone.

#### **Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
This molecule has a benzo group (a benzene ring) attached to a trifuran core. The substituents are not symmetrically distributed, as the benzo group introduces asymmetry. This reduces the symmetry of the molecule, making it unlikely to have **C₃h symmetry**.

#### **Option C: Triisopropyl borate**
Triisopropyl borate has a boron atom at the center with three identical isopropyl groups attached. Boron forms a trigonal planar geometry, and the three isopropyl groups are arranged symmetrically at 120° intervals. This gives the molecule a three-fold rotation axis (C₃). Additionally, the molecule lies in a plane, which serves as a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ). Therefore, triisopropyl borate has **C₃h symmetry**.

#### **Option D: Quinuclidine**
Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane structure with three identical bridgeheads. It has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) due to the symmetry of the three bridges. However, it does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ), as the molecule is not symmetric with respect to a plane perpendicular to the C₃ axis. Instead, it has a center of inversion (i), giving it **C₃i symmetry**, not **C₃h symmetry**.

### Conclusion:
Among the options, **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) is the only molecule that satisfies the requirements for **C₃h symmetry**, as it has both a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.
