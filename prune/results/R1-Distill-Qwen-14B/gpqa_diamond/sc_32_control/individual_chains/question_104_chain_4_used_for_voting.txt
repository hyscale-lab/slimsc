Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum as it moves due to the planet's gravity. The star moves towards and away from us, causing the spectral lines to shift slightly.

The question says there are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So the stars are identical, and the planets are similar in mass. 

The key data points are the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. For planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, but how does the Doppler shift relate to the orbital period? I think the RV method gives us the velocity of the star, which relates to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Oh right, the formula involved is probably from the Keplerian motion.

I recall that the radial velocity (V) is given by V = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p / (M_* + M_p)^(2/3)) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3))) ), but maybe a simpler approach is needed here.

Alternatively, considering that the RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. The semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = ( (G * P )^(-1/3) ) * ( ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * ( sin i ) ), but wait, I might be mixing up some terms here.

Wait, another approach. The Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. The velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G)^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )

But perhaps I should think in terms of the relationship between the velocity amplitude and the orbital period. Since both stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), maybe the velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. Because the velocity K is inversely proportional to the period P^(1/3), because from Kepler's third law, P² ∝ a³/(M_*), and velocity would relate to a/P.

Wait, Kepler's third law says that P² ∝ a³ / M_*, but since M_* is the same for both stars, P² ∝ a³. So a = (G M_* P² / (4π²)) )^(1/3).

But how does the velocity relate to a and P? The orbital velocity of the planet is v = 2π a / P. But in the radial velocity method, the star's velocity is related to the planet's velocity (since the star's mass is much larger, the planet's orbit is much smaller, but the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses). So, the star's velocity K is (M_p / M_*) * v_planet.

Wait, let me get this right. The planet and star orbit their common center of mass. So the star's velocity K is (M_p / (M_* + M_p)) * v_p, where v_p is the planet's orbital speed. But since M_* >> M_p (Sun-like star and Neptune-like planet), M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So K ≈ (M_p / M_*) * v_p.

But v_p is 2π a_p / P, where a_p is the planet's orbital radius. The star's velocity is K = 2π a_* / P, where a_* is the star's orbital radius around the center of mass. From a_* = (M_p / (M_* + M_p)) * a, which is approximately (M_p / M_*) a when M_* >> M_p.

So, K ≈ (M_p / M_*) * v_p = (M_p / M_*) * (2π a_p / P). But a_p = a_*, since they orbit the same center. Wait, no, a_* is the star's orbit, and a_p is the planet's orbit. But a_* + a_p = a (the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit around the star).

But perhaps I should think about the relationship between the velocity and the period. If I have two planets with the same mass orbiting identical stars, then the velocity of the star (K) is inversely proportional to the orbital period. Because K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (a / P), and a is related to P via Kepler's law.

Wait, let's think about Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/G M_*) * a³. So a³ = G M_* P² / (4π²). Then, a = ( G M_* P² / (4 π²) )^(1/3).

Substituting into the expression for K, which is K = (M_p / M_*) (2 π a / P ). Substituting a from Kepler's law:

K = (M_p / M_*) * (2 π / P ) * [ ( G M_* P² / (4 π²) )^(1/3) ) ]

Simplify this. Let's compute the exponents.

Let me compute step by step.

First, ( G M_* P² / (4 π²) )^(1/3) is equal to ( G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3) * (4 π²)^(-1/3).

So K becomes:

(M_p / M_*) * (2 π / P ) * ( G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3) * (4 π²)^(-1/3)

Simplify the terms:

Let's handle each part:

(M_p / M_*) remains.

(2 π) multiplied by (4 π²)^(-1/3): Let's compute that. 2 π * (4 π²)^(-1/3) = 2 π * [ (2² π² ) ]^(-1/3) ) = 2 π * (2^(-2/3) π^(-2/3) ) ) = 2 * 2^(-2/3) * π * π^(-2/3) ) = 2^(1 - 2/3) * π^(1 - 2/3) ) = 2^(1/3) * π^(1/3).

Then, the (M_p / M_*) multiplied by ( G M_* )^(1/3) gives M_p (G M_* )^(1/3) ) / M_* = M_p G^(1/3) M_*^(-2/3).

Putting it all together:

K = [ M_p G^(1/3) M_*^(-2/3) ] * [ 2^(1/3) π^(1/3) ] * [ P^(2/3 -1) ) ]

Wait, the P terms: we have (1/P) from the (2 π / P) term and P^(2/3) from the a term.

So (1/P) * P^(2/3) = P^(-1/3).

So putting it all together, K = M_p^(1) G^(1/3) M_*^(-2/3) * 2^(1/3) π^(1/3) * P^(-1/3).

We can write this as:

K = (M_p) * ( G / M_*^2 )^(1/3) * (2 π )^(1/3) * P^(-1/3 )

Hmm, maybe I can factor out the exponents:

K = (M_p) * ( G * 2 π / M_*^2 )^(1/3) * P^(-1/3 )

Wait, let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should just consider that for a given star (fixed M_*), the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Because in the equation, K ∝ (M_p) / (M_* ) * ( a / P )

But a is proportional to P^(2/3) (from Kepler's law), so a/P would be P^(2/3 -1) ) = P^(-1/3).

So K ∝ (M_p / M_*) ) * ( P^(-1/3) )

But since both planets have the same mass, M_p is the same, and the stars have same M_*, so K ∝ P^(-1/3). So, K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period.

Wait, but in the problem, the shifts are 5 and 7 milliangstroms. Assuming that the shifts are proportional to the velocity, because the Doppler shift is proportional to velocity. So the velocity semi-amplitude K1 for planet #1 is 5, and K2 for planet #2 is 7.

Wait, but wait: the problem says the spectral line shifts are 5 and 7 miliangstrom. The shift is directly proportional to the velocity of the star. So K1 = 5, K2 =7. 

Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3).

Wait, because K ∝ P^(-1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Let me think: K ∝ P^(-1/3) → K1 = C * P1^(-1/3), K2 = C * P2^(-1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Given K1=5 and K2=7, then 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1 → P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3.

Wait, but wait, no. Because 5/7 is the ratio K1/K2, and it's equal to (P2/P1)^(1/3). So:

(5/7) = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) → P2 / P1 = (5/7)^3.

So P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3.

Which would make P2 shorter than P1. But the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is shorter, the ratio would be less than 1.

Wait, no. Let me clarify:

The ratio of periods is P2/P1 = (5/7)^3. So P2 is (5/7)^3 times P1 → P2 is smaller.

But the question is "how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than that of planet #1?"

So (P2 - P1)/P1 = (P2/P1 -1) → but if P2 is smaller, then P2/P1 is less than 1, so the ratio is negative, but since it's about how many times longer, perhaps the question is just P2/P1.

Wait, the actual question is: How many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So it's P2/P1.

If I compute (5/7)^3, that's (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So planet #2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #1's period is longer, which would mean that planet #2's period is shorter. But I'm a bit confused because the question is phrased as "how many times longer is P2 than P1".

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if P2 < P1, then the period is not longer; it's shorter. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, let me double-check. K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. So K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

Wait, K is higher when the period is shorter. Because higher velocity would mean the star is moving faster, implying a shorter period. Because for a given planet mass, a shorter period would mean the planet is closer in, leading to higher velocity.

So K1=5 and K2=7 → K2>K1 → P2 < P1. So planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's.

But the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is shorter, that would be a factor <1. But looking at the options, option A is ~0.36, which is about 1/3.

So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times as long, meaning P2 is about 0.36 * P1. So the period is 0.36 times as long. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36.

But the question is phrased "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So the answer is approximately 0.36 times, so it's shorter, not longer. But the question is phrased as "longer", so perhaps I have the ratio backwards.

Wait, perhaps I got the ratio wrong. Let me re-examine.

Earlier, I set up K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Because K1 = C * P1^(-1/3), K2 = C * P2^(-1/3).

So K1/K2 = [P2/P1]^(1/3)

So, [K1/K2] = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Cubing both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1

So, P2 = (125/343) * P1 = (approx 0.364) P1.

So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So planet #2's period is about 0.36 times planet #1's. So it's shorter. 

But the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So the answer would be 0.36 times. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as planet #1's. So it's shorter, not longer. But the options include 0.36 as option A.

So the answer is option A: ~0.36.

Wait, but let me think again. Perhaps I should consider that a larger K means a shorter period. Since K2 is larger than K1, period of planet #2 is shorter.

So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That would be P2 / P1. If P2 is 0.36 of P1, then P2 is 0.36 times longer, which is not the case. Wait, that's confusing.

Wait, no. For example, if P2 is 0.5 * P1, then it's half as long. So if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then it's 36% of P1. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So it's not longer; it's shorter.

But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is shorter, it's not longer, so the factor would be less than 1. So the answer is approximately 0.36 times as long, which is option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the question is phrased as "how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than that of planet #1." So if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then planet #2's period is shorter. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, but the question is asking how many times longer. So perhaps the answer is that planet #2's period is about 0.36 times as long, which makes it shorter, not longer.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A: ~0.36.

The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the spectral lines of the host star, which is proportional to the star's velocity due to the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. In this problem, two stars with identical masses host planets of similar Neptune-like masses. The spectral line shifts for the two planets are given as 5 milliangstroms (Planet #1) and 7 milliangstroms (Planet #2). The question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), i.e., \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \). Since the stars and planets are otherwise identical, the relationship simplifies to:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Given \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

\[
\frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
