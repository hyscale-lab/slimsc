Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Hmm, that's an unusual relationship because I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Oh right, parallax plx is equal to 1 over distance r, or more precisely, plx (in parsecs) is 1/r where r is in parsecs. So plx = 1/r.

Wait, but wait. Parallax is measured in arcseconds, and the formula I remember is plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / r (in parsecs). So if the distance r increases, the parallax decreases. That's right.

So the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. The number varies as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, I can substitute that into the equation. Let's do that: N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's compute the exponent: (1/r)^5 is 1/(r^5), so 1 divided by that is r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, so if N is proportional to r^5, that means that as the distance r increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of r. But wait, that feels counterintuitive because when you look further away, shouldn't the number of stars you can see per unit distance decrease? Or maybe not, depending on the relation.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about the number of stars "per unit range of distance, r". Oh, so it's the number density or the count per unit distance. Hmm, perhaps I need to think in terms of how many stars are there in a thin shell at distance r, or per some volume.

Wait, no, the question says "the number of stars in that region of the sky" varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. So perhaps it's considering a certain region on the sky, so it's looking at a volume. Let me think about the formula for the number of stars in a volume as a function of distance.

Wait, the number of stars in a volume would depend on the volume itself and the density of stars. So if you have a region of the sky, which is a certain solid angle, and you consider a distance r, the volume element would be something like a cylinder. Or wait, perhaps it's a cone. But maybe it's easier to think in terms of flux or surface density.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the number of stars per unit parallax, and how that translates into the number per unit distance.

Wait, let me rephrase. The number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Parallax plx is 1/r. So substituting that in, N ∝ r^5. But that would mean that as r increases, the number of stars N increases as r^5. But wait, that can't be right because if you go further away, the density of stars in a given volume should decrease, but perhaps the number depends on how much volume you're observing.

Oh, wait a minute. Maybe the way the question is phrased implies that for a fixed region of the sky, the number of stars as a function of parallax is 1/(plx)^5. So for a fixed area on the sky, you're considering stars at different distances, and the number you count in each distance bin (say, a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr) varies with 1/(plx)^5, which is r^5.

Wait, but in reality, the number of stars you can observe in a shell at distance r is proportional to the volume of the shell times the density of stars. The volume of a thin shell is approximately 4πr² dr. So if the star density is n, then the number is N = n * 4πr² dr. If the density of stars is uniform, then N ∝ r² dr. But in this case, the number varies as 1/(plx)^5, which is r^5.

Hmm, that's not matching with the usual expectation. So perhaps the question is suggesting that the number of stars per unit parallax is 1/(plx)^5. Or maybe it's per unit volume or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of how the number of stars detected varies with parallax, and then relate that to distance. So, if N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and plx = 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance. But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you look further away, each star is dimmer, but the number of stars in a volume would depend on the density and the volume.

Wait, maybe the question is a bit different. It says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So perhaps the number of stars (per unit area?) in that region is 1/(plx)^5. So if I have a region of the sky, and I count the number of stars, it's proportional to 1/(plx)^5.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance. So if I have a region of the sky, the number of stars in that region is N = k/(plx)^5, where k is a constant.

But since plx = 1/r, that becomes N = k r^5.

So as the distance r increases, the number of stars in that region increases as r^5. Hmm, that's a bit odd because when you look further away, you're seeing more volume, so perhaps the number of stars increases. But the exponent is quite high.

But let's think about how star density might work. If the star density (number per unit volume) is uniform, then number in a shell is proportional to r^2 dr. So for a given dr, the number is proportional to r^2. But here, the number is proportional to r^5, which is way higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that for each unit of parallax, the number of stars drops as 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is inversely proportional to r, the number of stars increases with r^5. So, per unit distance, the number of stars increases as r^5.

But the question is, how does the number of stars change with distance per unit range of distance, r. So perhaps it's the differential: dN/dr.

If N ∝ r^5, then dN/dr ∝ 5 r^4.

Wait, but the options don't include r^4. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) ~ r^3
B) ~ r^5
C) ~ r^4
D) ~ r^2

So the options are A to D as given.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-express the problem.

The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

But plx = 1/r, so N ∝ r^5.

So, N is proportional to r^5. So for each distance r, the number N increases as r^5. But the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range). So perhaps it's the rate of change, the derivative.

Wait, but the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the number of stars per unit distance. So like, how many stars are there per parsec, as you go further.

Wait, but the given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So if you plot N against r, it's a r^5 curve. So the number increases rapidly with r.

But if the number of stars per unit distance (like per parsec) is being asked, that would be dN/dr. So if N = kr^5, then dN/dr = 5kr^4. So the rate of increase is proportional to r^4.

But looking at the options, C is r^4, so that would be the case for dN/dr.

Wait, but the question specifically says "the number of stars [...] varies with parallax as 1/plx^5", which would translate to N proportional to r^5. So the number of stars in the region is going as r^5. So if someone asks how the number changes with distance (as r increases), the number increases as r^5. So the answer would be B) ~ r^5.

But wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me read the question again.

"In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?"

Wait, so the number varies as 1/(plx)^5. So N = k/(plx)^5. plx = 1/r, so N = k r^5.

So for a given region, as the distance increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. So per unit distance, the number is increasing rapidly.

So the correct answer would be B) ~ r^5.

But wait, another thought. The question says "per unit range of distance, r." Does that mean the number per unit distance (like dN/dr), or the number in a unit distance interval (like from r to r+dr, which would be ~ N(r) * dr, which would be r^5 dr). Hmm, no, that's actually the number in a shell, which would be proportional to r^5 dr. But if the question is about the number per unit distance, that's the derivative, which is r^5 dr gives N_shell, so dN/dr = r^5. So N_shell = r^5 dr. So the number in a shell is proportional to r^5 dr. So the number per unit distance (dN/dr) is r^5.

Wait, but in that case, the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^5. So for a given distance range, the number would increase as r^5.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think of a simpler case. Suppose N varies as plx^m. Since plx = 1/r, then N = k (1/r)^m = k r^{-m}.

So, if m is positive, N decreases as r increases.

But in the question, m is -5. So N varies as 1/(plx)^5, which is r^5. So N increases with r^5.

So if I have a region of the sky, and I look at stars at a distance r, I find N proportional to r^5. That suggests that as I go further away, I'm seeing more stars. But that doesn't make much sense because when you look further, each star is dimmer, but the volume you can survey increases, which could mean more stars. But the dependence here is stronger than the usual r^3 (if density is uniform, the number in a volume is r^3, but here it's r^5).

Wait, maybe the question is considering that each star's flux is being measured, and that affects the count. Or perhaps the density of stars isn't uniform but increases with distance, which is an unusual scenario.

But regardless, based on the given, I have to follow the math. So N ∝ r^5, so the number of stars in that region increases as r^5. So the answer would be option B.

But wait, the question asks how the number changes per unit range of distance. So if r is increasing, the number of stars in a per unit distance would be dN/dr, which is 5 r^4. So maybe the answer is C) ~ r^4. But I'm confused now.

Wait, maybe I should think about the number of stars per unit distance, which is dN/dr. If N = kr^5, then dN/dr = 5kr^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (like per parsec) increases as r^4. So the change is proportional to r^4.

But the question says "how does the number of stars [...] change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

So if it's asking about the rate of change, it's r^4. So the answer would be C) ~ r^4.

Wait, but the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me parse the question again.

The question is: "How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?"

Ah, so it's the number per unit distance. So the number of stars per parsec (or per unit distance) would be dN/dr. But N is proportional to r^5. So dN/dr is proportional to r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4.

Wait, but that would mean that as you go further away, each additional parsec you look, you find more stars—exponentially more. That seems counterintuitive because usually, the number of stars in a given volume depends on the volume, which is r^3. But according to this question, it's r^5. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in how I'm interpreting the question. Maybe the number of stars is proportional to 1/(plx^5), which is r^5, but this is for the same region of the sky. So as you look further away, you're covering a larger volume, and if the number of stars you observe in that region increases as r^5, then it's because the density of stars is increasing with distance. But that's an unusual assumption, but perhaps the question doesn't require that.

So, given that, the number of stars N is proportional to r^5. So when the distance increases, N increases as r^5. So the correct answer is B.

But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance. So if you move a unit distance away, how does the number change? So, the derivative. So dN/dr is proportional to r^4. So the change is proportional to r^4.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question says the number varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. So N is proportional to r^5. Therefore, when the distance increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. So the answer is B) ~ r^5.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), we can substitute \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \) into the equation. This gives:

\[
N \propto r^5
\]

This means that the number of stars in the region increases as the fifth power of the distance. The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance "per unit range of distance, \( r \)." This phrasing suggests that the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance is being asked, which is the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \).

Starting from \( N \propto r^5 \), the derivative is:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \). However, the question does not explicitly clarify whether it is asking for the total number of stars (\( N \)) or the number per unit distance (\( \frac{dN}{dr} \)). Based on the phrasing, the total number of stars in the region is proportional to \( r^5 \), which directly aligns with the given relationship.

Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the number of stars in the region increases as \( r^5 \), making the answer:

**Answer: B**
