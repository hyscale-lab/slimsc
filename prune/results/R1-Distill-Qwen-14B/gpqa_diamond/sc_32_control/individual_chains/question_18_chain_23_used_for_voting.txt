Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances, and I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars compared to each other. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

Alright, the question gives me data about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But I think the mass might not be directly relevant here, unless it affects their lifetimes or something else like that. But the question is about elemental abundances, so maybe I can focus on the given abundance ratios.

The elemental abundances given are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex for Star_1
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex for Star_2
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex for Star_1
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex for Star_2

Wait, I need to remember what these brackets mean. Oh right, the brackets [X/Y] represent the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10( (X/Y)_star / (X/Y)_sun )

The photospheric composition of the Sun is given as:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5
Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = 7-12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5

Wait, or is it the other way around? Oh wait, wait, no. The way the notation works is, for the Sun, n_X / n_H is given as 10^(value). Let me think. Because 12 + log10(...) = 7.5 → log10(...) = -4.5 → the value inside is 10^(-4.5), right?

So for the Sun:
nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

Now the question is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So I need to find (n_Si, star1 / n_Si, star2) ?

Wait no, wait. Wait, I think the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in each star's photosphere. Wait, the way the question is phrased: "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So that would be (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2), which is the ratio of silicon in Star 1 to that in Star 2.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me read the question again: "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So yes, it's the ratio of their silicon abundances, so [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2].

But wait, the given data is about [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si], and [Fe/H] and [Mg/H]. So I need to find [Si/H] for each star, then take the ratio (Star_1's [Si/H] divided by Star_2's [Si/H]).

Because the ratio of silicon in each star is (n_Si1 / n_H1) / (n_Si2 / n_H2) ) = (n_Si1 /n_Si2 ) * (n_H2 /n_H1 ). But wait, because [X/H] is log10(n_X/nH). But if the stars are in LTE and using the same method, maybe their H is the same as the Sun? Or wait, [Fe/H] is given as 0 for Star_1 and [Mg/H] as 0 for Star_2. Hmm.

Wait, [Fe/H] is 0 for Star_1, which means that [Fe/H] = log10(n_Fe1 / n_H1) - log10(n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) = 0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun.

Similarly, [Mg/H] for Star_2 is 0 → n_Mg2 /n_H2 = n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun.

So, Star_1 has [Fe/H] =0, so n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun.

But wait, the Sun's n_Fe/n_H is given as 10^(-4.5). So Star_1 has n_Fe1 /n_H1 = 10^(-4.5) as well.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H] = 0 → n_Mg2 /n_H2 = n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun = 10^(-5).

Now, for Star_1, [Si/Fe] = 0.3. That means [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10( (n_Si1/n_Fe1) / (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) = 0.3.

But since n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun → n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H1.

Wait, perhaps I should express [Si/Fe] in terms of [Si/H] and [Fe/H]. Because [Si/Fe] = [Si/H] - [Fe/H].

For Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1. Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

So [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 → log10(n_Si1 / n_H1) - log10(n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) ) = 0.3 → n_Si1/n_H1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) * 10^(0.3).

Wait, but n_Si_sun /n_H_sun is something we can calculate from the given data. Because the Sun's [Fe/H] is given as 7.5 for Fe and 7 for Mg.

Wait, no, the Sun's n_Fe/n_H is 10^(-4.5), as I calculated earlier. Similarly, n_Mg/n_H is 10^(-5).

But for the Sun, how about n_Si/n_H? Hmm, I don't have that directly. Oh wait, because the question provides [Mg/Si]_2. So for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log10( (n_Mg2/n_Si2) / (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) ) ) = 0.3.

But since n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun = 10^(-5), as [Mg/H]_2 is 0.

Wait, so let's compute n_Si in each star.

Starting with Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → [Si/Fe] = log(n_Si1 / n_Fe1) - log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) ) = 0.3.

But since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun) → So n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) * n_H1.

So n_Si1 /n_Fe1 = (n_Si1 / n_H1) * (n_H1 / n_Fe1 ) = [Si/H]_1 * (n_H1 / n_Fe1 )

Wait, but [Si/Fe] = [Si/H] - [Fe/H], which for Star_1 is [Si/H]_1 - 0 = 0.3 → [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

So [Si/H]_1 = log10(n_Si1 /n_H1) - log10(n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) ) = 0.3.

So n_Si1 /n_H1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) * 10^(0.3).

But wait, I don't know n_Si_sun /n_H_sun directly. Hmm, but perhaps I can find it from the Mg/Si ratio for Star_2.

Wait, no. Let me think. For the Sun, what's the abundance of Si compared to H?

Well, if I can find n_Si_sun /n_H_sun, then I can plug it into the equation.

But wait, I don't have that data. The question only gives n_Fe and n_Mg for the Sun. So maybe I need to relate Si to Mg or Fe using other data.

Wait, let's think about the solar abundances.

We know n_Fe/n_H = 10^(-4.5)
n_Mg/n_H = 10^(-5)

But without knowing n_Si/n_H for the Sun, perhaps I can use the [Mg/Si] ratio for Star_2.

Wait, for Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log10( (n_Mg2/n_Si2) / (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) ) ) = 0.3.

But from [Mg/H]_2 = 0: n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun → n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H2.

So, substituting into [Mg/Si] equation:

log10( ( (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun *n_H2) / (n_Si2) ) / (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) ) ) = 0.3.

Simplify the numerator inside the log: (n_Mg_sun * n_H2) / (n_H_sun * n_Si2) ) divided by (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) ) equals (n_H2 /n_H_sun) * (n_Si_sun / n_Si2).

So log10( (n_H2 /n_H_sun) * (n_Si_sun /n_Si2) ) ) = 0.3.

Which is log10( (n_Si_sun /n_Si2) * (n_H2 /n_H_sun) ) ) = 0.3.

Which can be split as log10(n_Si_sun /n_Si2) ) + log10(n_H2 /n_H_sun) ) = 0.3.

But I don't know about n_H2 or n_Si2 relative to the Sun. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express n_Si2 in terms of other elements.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Si/H] for each star and then take the ratio.

Let me outline the steps again.

1. For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun = 10^(-4.5).

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → [Si/Fe] = log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) - log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) ) = 0.3.

So, (n_Si1/n_Fe1) = (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1/n_H_sun) → So,

n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3 * n_Fe1.

But n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1/n_H_sun).

So,

n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3 * n_Fe_sun * (n_H1/n_H_sun) )

Simplify:

n_Si1 = n_Si_sun * 10^0.3 * (n_H1/n_H_sun )

So, n_Si1/n_H1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) * 10^0.3.

Which is [Si/H]_1 = log10( (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) ) ) = 0.3 → which aligns with what we had earlier. So this doesn't give me the solar [Si/H], but perhaps I can relate it.

Wait, but I don't know the solar [Si/H]. So maybe I need to find it through another route.

Wait, perhaps I can use Star_2's [Mg/Si] and [Mg/H] to find [Si/H]_2.

For Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log10( (n_Mg2/n_Si2) / (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) ) ) =0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2 =0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun → n_Mg2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun *n_H2.

Substituting into [Mg/Si]_2 equation:

log10( ( (n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun *n_H2) /n_Si2 ) / (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) ) ) =0.3.

Simplify the numerator inside the log:

(n_Mg_sun *n_H2 )/(n_H_sun *n_Si2 ) * (n_Si_sun/(n_Mg_sun)) ) = (n_Si_sun *n_H2 )/(n_H_sun *n_Si2 )

So,

log10( (n_Si_sun *n_H2 )/(n_H_sun *n_Si2 ) ) ) =0.3.

Which can be split into log10(n_Si_sun/n_Si2) + log10(n_H2/n_H_sun) ) =0.3.

But I don't know n_Si_sun or n_Si2. Hmm, perhaps I can express n_Si2 in terms of [Si/H]_2.

Wait, [Si/H]_2 is what we need. Because [Si/H] is log10(n_Si2/n_H2) - log10(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) ) → Let [Si/H]_2 = x.

So, n_Si2/n_H2 = n_Si_sun/n_H_sun * 10^x → n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun *10^x ) *n_H2.

Plugging this back into the equation from Star_2:

log10( (n_Si_sun *n_H2 )/(n_H_sun *n_Si2 ) ) =0.3.

Substitute n_Si2:

(n_Si_sun *n_H2 )/(n_H_sun * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun *10^x ) *n_H2 ) ) = (n_Si_sun *n_H2 )/(n_H_sun * n_Si_sun /n_H_sun * 10^x *n_H2 ) ) = 1/(10^x )

So,

log10(1/(10^x )) =0.3 → log10(10^(-x)) =0.3 → -x =0.3 → x = -0.3.

Wait, so [Si/H]_2 = x = -0.3.

Meaning, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 → which is log10(n_Si2/n_H2) - log10(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) ) = -0.3 → n_Si2/n_H2 = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) *10^(-0.3).

But wait, I thought [Si/H] is the logarithm of the ratio relative to the Sun. So if [Si/H] is -0.3, then the star's silicon is 10^(-0.3) times the solar value.

So, n_Si2/n_H2 = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) * 10^(-0.3).

But I don't know n_Si_sun/n_H_sun. Hmm, is there a way to find that?

Wait, perhaps from the given data, but I only have Fe and Mg for the Sun. Maybe I can look up the solar abundance of Si, but the question doesn't provide that. Alternatively, perhaps I can find it using the [Mg/Si] ratio.

Wait, for the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun = log10( (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) / (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) ) ) = 0. So [Mg/Si]_sun is 0.

But for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3. So, the star's Mg/Si is higher than solar by 0.3 dex.

But perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps I can write down the expressions for [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2.

For Star_1:

[Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 = 0 + 0.3 = 0.3.

For Star_2:

We found [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Wait, but how does that make sense? Because [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3, which implies that Mg is more abundant than Si relative to the Sun. So in Star_2, Mg is more abundant than Si, compared to solar. But if [Si/H]_2 is lower than solar, that matches.

But I'm not sure. Let me go back.

So, the ratio of silicon in the two stars' photospheres is (n_Si1 / n_Si2) = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H2/n_Si2) ) * (n_H1/n_H2) )? Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of each star's [Si/H].

Because n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) * 10^{ [Si/H]_1 } * n_H1.

Similarly, n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) * 10^{ [Si/H]_2 } * n_H2.

So, the ratio (n_Si1 /n_Si2 ) = (10^{0.3} / 10^{-0.3}) ) * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

Wait, because [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, [Si/H]_2 is -0.3.

So that's 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} } = 10^{0.6} → which is about 3.98.

But wait, I also have the (n_H1 /n_H2 ) factor.

Because n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *10^{0.3} *n_H1

n_Si2= (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *10^{-0.3} *n_H2

So ratio is (10^{0.3} *n_H1 ) / (10^{-0.3} *n_H2 ) = 10^{0.6} * (n_H1/n_H2 )

But what's n_H1 /n_H2? Hmm, I don't have information about the total hydrogen in each star. But wait, the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are given, which might relate to the overall metallicity.

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0 → [Fe/H] = log10(n_Fe1/n_H1 ) - log10(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun ) → 0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun → as we had earlier.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H] is 0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun.

But the question doesn't give [H] for each star, so perhaps we can assume that the stars have the same hydrogen as the Sun, but that's probably wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio n_H1/n_H2 is 1, but that may not be the case.

Wait, but perhaps the ratio n_H1/n_H2 can be determined using the fact that the stars have different masses and perhaps different lifetimes, but I don't think that's directly applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps the H abundance is the same in both stars, but I don't think that's necessarily the case.

Wait, wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again.

The question states that the ratio is the ratio of silicon in each star's photosphere. So it's (n_Si1 / n_Si2 ).

But n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *10^{0.3} *n_H1.

n_Si2= (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *10^{-0.3} *n_H2.

So the ratio is (10^{0.3} *n_H1 ) / (10^{-0.3} *n_H2 ) ) = 10^{0.6} * (n_H1/n_H2).

But unless we can find n_H1/n_H2, we can't compute this. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the question assumes that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun. So n_H1 = n_H_sun, n_H2 = n_H_sun → so the ratio becomes 10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98. Which is close to option A (~3.9).

But wait, does that make sense? Because [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which would mean that Star_1 has the same Fe/H as the Sun. So if Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0, then n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun → so H in Star_1 is the same as the Sun? Well, that depends on the star's overall metallicity. Wait, no, because [Fe/H] is zero, but other elements might vary.

Wait, but for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so n_Fe1 is (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H1 → So if n_Fe1 is same as solar scaled by H, perhaps n_H1 is same as n_H_sun.

Wait, but no. Because if n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun → n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1/n_H_sun ) → So if n_H1 is larger than n_H_sun, then n_Fe1 is larger, but [Fe/H] would remain the same. So [Fe/H] being zero only means that the ratio is same as the Sun, but not necessarily the absolute abundance.

But without knowing the absolute number of hydrogens, perhaps the problem makes the assumption that the stars have the same hydrogen as the Sun, meaning n_H1 = n_H2 = n_H_sun.

If that's the case, then the ratio (n_Si1/n_Si2 ) = 10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.

From the given, the ratio is (n_Si1 /n_Si2 ) = (n_Si1 /n_H1 ) * (n_H2 /n_Si2 )

But [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 → n_Si1/n_H1 = n_Si_sun/n_H_sun * 10^{0.3}

[Si/H]_2 = -0.3 → n_Si2/n_H2 = n_Si_sun/n_H_sun * 10^{-0.3}

So,

n_Si1/n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun * 10^{0.3} *n_H1 ) / (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun *10^{-0.3} *n_H2 ) )

Simplify:

= (10^{0.3} /10^{-0.3}) ) * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

= 10^{0.6} * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

But what is (n_H1 /n_H2 )?

Wait, perhaps I can find this from the stars' [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] abundances.

For Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun → So n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1/n_H_sun )

For Star_2: [Mg/H]_2 =0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun → n_Mg2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H2/n_H_sun )

But I don't see a direct relation between n_H1 and n_H2 here. Unless we have other information about the stars.

Wait, perhaps the stars have the same overall metallicity, but I don't think that's given. Alternatively, maybe considering that [Fe/H]1 is 0 and [Mg/H]2 is 0, but they're different stars, so perhaps their H isn't the same.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the stars have the same [H] abundance, but I don't think that's given.

I'm stuck on how to find n_H1/n_H2.

Wait, but perhaps the question assumes that the H abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun. So n_H1 =n_H_sun, n_H2= n_H_sun. Then n_H1/n_H2=1.

In that case, the ratio is 10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98, which is option A.

But I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption. Because in reality, the hydrogen abundance could vary, but the question doesn't provide that information. So perhaps the correct approach is to proceed under the assumption that the stars have the same hydrogen as the Sun, or that the H ratio is 1.

Given that, the ratio is approximately 3.98, which matches option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and use the relationships between the abundances.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3 dex
   - [Fe/H]₁ = 0 dex
   - This implies [Si/H]₁ = [Si/Fe]₁ + [Fe/H]₁ = 0.3 dex.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3 dex
   - [Mg/H]₂ = 0 dex.
   - Using the relationship [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H], we find [Si/H]₂ = [Mg/H]₂ - [Mg/Si]₂ = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3 dex.

3. **Solar Composition**:
   - For the Sun, the photospheric composition is given as:
     - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \implies \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \).
     - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \implies \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \).
   - These values are used to normalize the abundances relative to the Sun.

### Silicon Abundance Ratio:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}}}.
\]

1. For **Star_1**:
   - [Si/H]₁ = 0.3 dex implies:
     \[
     \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}} = \left(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}\right)_{\odot} \cdot 10^{0.3}.
     \]

2. For **Star_2**:
   - [Si/H]₂ = -0.3 dex implies:
     \[
     \frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} = \left(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}\right)_{\odot} \cdot 10^{-0.3}.
     \]

3. Substituting these into the ratio:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}\right)_{\odot} \cdot 10^{0.3}}{\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}\right)_{\odot} \cdot 10^{-0.3}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}.
   \]

4. Simplifying further:
   \[
   10^{0.6} \approx 3.98.
   \]

### Assumption:
The problem does not provide information about the relative hydrogen abundances (\(n_{\text{H,1}}/n_{\text{H,2}}\)), so we assume the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun (\(n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{H}}^{\odot}\)).

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.98**, which corresponds to option **A**.

ANSWER: A
