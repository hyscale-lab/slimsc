Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and think through what I need to do. 

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C, which I think is room temperature and might affect the Ka values, but I don't see any other info, so I'll use the given Ka values as is. 

The Ka values for H3PO4 are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 =6.2e-8, and Ka3=1.8e-12. Phosphoric acid is a triprotic acid, so it can donate three protons. 

Orthophosphate ion is PO4^3-, which is the fully deprotonated form. But wait, when you have a mixture of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, I think this is a buffer solution. Because each of these salts will dissociate in water, contributing to the phosphate species.

First, I need to figure out how much of each salt contributes which phosphate species in solution. 

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, I think it dissociates as KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. It dissociates into 2 Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2 H2O. Wait, wait. Let me get the formula right. Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate. So in solution, it gives 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. 

So in the solution, we have H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4. 

Wait, but the problem is asking for orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-), which is the deprotonated form beyond HPO4^2-. So under what conditions do HPO4^2- deprotonate further to form PO4^3-?

That's where the Ka values come into play. The third ionization is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-. The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small. So the extent of deprotonation from HPO4^2- to PO4^3- is minimal. But maybe I should consider it?

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is such that the species present are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and some very little PO4^3-.

Wait, but the problem specifically asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-.

So I need to calculate [PO4^3-] in the solution.

How do I approach this? Hmm. 

I remember that in solution, the various phosphate species are in equilibrium due to the ionization steps. So I can model this using the given Ka values.

Let me first find the moles of each phosphate species in the solution.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ let me calculate that. 1.00 divided by 136.09 is approximately 0.007346 mol.

Similarly, moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005601 mol.

Wait, but when these salts dissolve, they contribute to the phosphate species. 

KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-
So moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 are 0.007346 mol.

Na2HPO4 → 2 Na+ + HPO4^2- (each mole of Na2HPO4 contributes one mole of HPO4^2-)
So moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O are 0.005601 mol.

So in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But these species can interconvert through the second and third dissociations of H3PO4.

So perhaps we can model the solution using the equilibrium expressions.

H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so:

1. H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- ; Ka1 =7.5e-3
2. H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- ; Ka2=6.2e-8
3. HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- ; Ka3=1.8e-12

In the solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but some of them may deprotonate further, especially considering the low pH from the first dissociation.

Wait, but the solution is a mixture of a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-), which makes it a buffer solution. So the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation.

Wait, H2PO4^- is the acid, HPO4^2- is the conjugate base. So for the second ionization, the relevant Ka is Ka2=6.2e-8.

So the pH of the solution can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa2 + log([A^-]/[HA])

Here, [A^-] is [HPO4^2-], and [HA] is [H2PO4^-].

So let me calculate the concentrations first.

Total volume is 0.2 L.

Molarity of H2PO4^- is 0.007346 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03673 M.

Molarity of HPO4^2- is 0.005601 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028005 M.

So, plugging into Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207 (since 10^(-7.207) ≈6.2e-8)

Wait, let me compute pKa2. Ka2 =6.2e-8, so pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) = ~7.207.

So, pH = 7.207 + log(0.028005 / 0.03673)

Let me compute that ratio: 0.028005 / 0.03673 ≈ 0.763.

Log(0.763) is about -0.118.

So pH ≈7.207 - 0.118 =7.089.

Wait, so pH is approximately 7.09.

But, the presence of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- would establish a pH around 7.1.

Now, considering the third dissociation, HPO4^2- can deprotonate to PO4^3-: 

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- ; Ka3=1.8e-12

So the concentration of PO4^3- depends on the pH, since the third ionization is a function of the H+ concentration.

The expression for Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.

We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+].

We know Ka3 is 1.8e-12, and [HPO4^2-] is 0.028005 M. But [H+] can be found using the pH, which is 7.09.

Wait, pH is 7.09, so [H+] = 1e-7.09 ≈ approximately 8.25e-8 M.

Let me compute that accurately. 10^(-7.09) = 10^(-7 -0.09) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.09). 10^(-0.09) is about 0.812. So [H+] ≈ 8.12e-8 M.

So plugging the numbers into [PO4^3-]:

(1.8e-12) * (0.028005) / (8.12e-8) 

Let me compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028005 ≈ 5.04e-14.

Divide by 8.12e-8: 5.04e-14 / 8.12e-8 ≈ 6.207e-7 M.

Wait, that's around 6.21e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, the moles:

KH2PO4: 1.00g /136.09 g/mol = let me compute this more accurately.

136.09 is approximately 136.09.

1 /136.09 ≈0.007336 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g /177.99 g/mol =0.005601 mol.

So, molarity of H2PO4^- is 0.007336 / 0.2 = 0.03668 M.

Molarity of HPO4^2- is 0.005601 /0.2 = 0.028005 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 is log(6.2e-8)= 7.207.

Ratio is 0.028005 / 0.03668 ≈0.7642.

Log(0.7642)= approximately -0.117.

So pH is 7.207 -0.117 =7.09.

[H+] =10^-7.09 ≈ 8.12e-8 M.

Then, using Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-].

Solving for [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028005) /8.12e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.028005 = let's see, 1.8 * 0.028 is 0.0504, so 0.0504e-12 =5.04e-14.

Denominator is 8.12e-8.

So 5.04e-14 /8.12e-8 = (5.04 /8.12) * 1e-6 ≈0.6207 *1e-6=6.207e-7 M.

So approximately 6.21e-7 M, which is option A:6.24e-7 M.

Wait, but wait a second. The question is about orthophosphate (PO4^3-). What if I'm missing another source of PO4^3-? For example, does the H3PO4 present contribute to PO4^3-? But in this solution, H3PO4 isn't present as a separate acid. The phosphate comes from the two salts.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider all the equilibria, but given that the concentrations of PO4^3- are so low due to the high pH (7.09) and the small Ka3, I think the initial approach is correct.

Wait, wait, another possibility: perhaps some of the H2PO4^- is deprotonated further beyond HPO4^2-?

But since the pH is about 7.09, which is below the pKa3, which is pKa3= -log(1.8e-12)=11.74.

So if pH is 7.09, which is much lower than pKa3, so the deprotonation of HPO4^2- to PO4^3- is minimal. So the majority of HPO4^2- remains as HPO4^2-.

But wait, since pH is 7.09, which is less than pKa3 (11.74), the HPO4^2- would not deprotonate much. So the [PO4^3-] is indeed minimal.

Wait, but the calculation I did earlier suggests about 6e-7 M, which is very low, but possible.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close to what I calculated. So I think the correct answer is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions ([PO4^3-]) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and use equilibrium expressions.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each salt
- **KH2PO4**:  
  Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007346 mol.  
  Dissociates as KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-, contributing 0.007346 mol of H2PO4^-.

- **Na2HPO4·2H2O**:  
  Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005601 mol.  
  Dissociates as Na2HPO4 → 2 Na+ + HPO4^2-, contributing 0.005601 mol of HPO4^2-.

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations in the solution
The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ = 0.2 L.  
- **[H2PO4^-]** = 0.007346 mol / 0.2 L ≈ 0.03673 M.  
- **[HPO4^2-]** = 0.005601 mol / 0.2 L ≈ 0.028005 M.

### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH
The solution is a buffer with H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (conjugate base). The relevant equilibrium is:  
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2-, with \( K_a = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \).  
The pH is calculated using:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO4^2-}]}{[\text{H2PO4^-}]}\right)
\]
- \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207 \).  
- Ratio = \( \frac{[\text{HPO4^2-}]}{[\text{H2PO4^-}]} = \frac{0.028005}{0.03673} \approx 0.763 \).  
- \( \log(0.763) \approx -0.118 \).  
Thus,  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 - 0.118 \approx 7.089.
\]

### Step 4: Use the third dissociation to find [PO4^3-]
The third dissociation is:  
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-, with \( K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \).  
The equilibrium expression is:  
\[
K_a = \frac{[\text{H+}][\text{PO4^3-}]}{[\text{HPO4^2-}]}
\]
Rearranging for [PO4^3-]:  
\[
[\text{PO4^3-}] = \frac{K_a \cdot [\text{HPO4^2-}]}{[\text{H+}]}
\]
- \( [\text{H+}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.089} \approx 8.12 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M} \).  
- Substituting values:  
\[
[\text{PO4^3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028005)}{8.12 \times 10^{-8}} \approx \frac{5.04 \times 10^{-14}}{8.12 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.21 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the closest option
The calculated concentration of [PO4^3-] is approximately \( 6.21 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which is closest to option **A: \( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**.
