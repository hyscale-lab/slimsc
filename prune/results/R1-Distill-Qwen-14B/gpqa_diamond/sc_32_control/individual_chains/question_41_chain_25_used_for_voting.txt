Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Let's see... The question states that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember something about the speed of light in a medium and how motion affects it. Let's think. First, the speed of light in a medium is given by v_medium = c/n, right? So in the glass, the speed of light is 1/n when n is the index of refraction because c is given as 1 here.

But wait, the glass is moving. So the observer is in the lab, and the glass is moving at velocity v. Does that affect the speed of light as measured by the observer? I'm trying to recall if this involves the Doppler effect or something related to relativity, but wait, the problem states that the glass is moving at a constant velocity, so maybe it's not relativistic speeds. Oh, but in relativity, the speed of light is always c, but I'm not sure if that applies here because the medium is moving.

Wait, actually, in the context of classical physics, when a medium is moving, does that change the speed of light in that medium as observed? I think that in the classical case, the speed of light in the medium is still v_medium = c/n, but the direction might change due to the motion of the medium. But wait, no, the speed itself might not change, but the observed direction changes due to the medium's motion. Wait, but the question is specifically about the speed, not the direction.

Wait, but the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So if the glass is moving towards the observer, then the beam is moving towards the observer as well. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocity of the light as observed is the velocity in the medium plus the medium's velocity. Wait, no, that's not right. Because in a medium, the speed of light is determined by the medium's properties. So the speed of light in the medium is 1/n, regardless of the medium's motion. But wait, wait. Suppose the medium is moving. How does that affect the observed speed of the light within it?

Wait, I remember something about the Galilean transformation. Because in non-relativistic mechanics, velocities add up. So if the medium is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame, and the light is moving at velocity u in the medium's frame, then in the lab frame, the speed would be u + v? But that can't be right because the speed of light is supposed to be c in all frames. Oh, but wait, that's in special relativity. But in this problem, maybe we're considering the classical approach where the speed of light depends on the medium's motion.

Wait, but this is a tricky point. Let me think again. In a medium, the speed of light is determined by the medium's properties (like n). But when the medium itself is moving, does that additive velocity affect the observed speed?

Wait, let me approach this from another angle. Suppose the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. So the light beam is moving in the same direction as the glass. The observer is in the lab frame, which sees the glass moving towards them. Wait, no, the question says the glass is moving towards the observer, so v is in the direction towards the observer.

Wait, no, the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the beam is moving towards the observer because the glass is moving towards the observer. So the light is moving towards the observer.

Wait, but the speed of the light in the medium is 1/n. So in the medium's frame, the light's speed is 1/n. But in the lab frame, where the medium is moving, how do we compute the speed of light?

Hold on, in the Galilean transformation, velocities add. So if an object in the medium is moving at u relative to the medium, then in the lab frame, its speed is u + v. But that's when the speeds are non-relativistic, and v is the speed of the medium relative to the lab.

Wait, but light is a bit different. Because in a medium, the speed is 1/n, but when the medium is moving, the speed of light as observed in the lab might be different.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model it using the velocity addition formula from special relativity, but that's probably overcomplicating, and since the problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum is 1, but the medium is moving, I'm not sure.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. So the light is moving through the glass, which itself is moving. So the total speed is the speed of light in the glass plus the velocity of the glass.

Wait, but that's only correct in the non-relativistic case. Because in reality, according to special relativity, velocities don't simply add like that, but the problem might be assuming non-relativistic speeds, given that n is just the index of refraction.

So the speed of light in the medium is v_light = 1/n.

The medium is moving at velocity v towards the observer. Wait, no, the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass, which is moving towards the observer. So the glass's velocity is v in the direction of the beam towards the observer.

So in the lab frame, the speed of the light would be v_light + v_medium?

Wait, but that would imply that the speed is (1/n) + v. But that doesn't match any of the options given. Looking at the options:

Option B is 1, which is the speed of light in a vacuum. But in the medium, it's 1/n, so unless v is zero, the speed should be less than 1.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the speed of light in the medium as observed is (c + v) / (n + v), or something like that. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Let's think about the formula.

Wait, in the case of the medium moving, the speed observed for light in the medium would be (v_light + v_medium) / (1 + (v_light * v_medium)/c^2), but that's the relativistic velocity addition formula. But if the speeds are non-relativistic (v << 1), then the denominator approaches 1, and the speed is approximately v_light + v_medium.

Wait, but in this problem, v is just some velocity. Hmm. Let me try to compute it using the relativistic approach.

In the medium's frame (glass frame), the light is moving at speed u' = 1/n.

The lab frame is moving at speed v relative to the glass frame. Wait, no, the glass is moving at v relative to the lab. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light.

Wait, I think I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/(c^2))

In this case, u' is the speed of light in the glass, which is 1/n. v is the speed of the glass relative to the lab, which is v.

So substituting:

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (1/n) * v ) )

Wait, let me compute that.

So numerator is (1 + n v)/n.

Denominator is 1 + (v/n) = (n + v)/n.

So u = [ (1 + n v)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ] = (1 + n v) / (n + v).

Wait, so the speed observed in the lab would be (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v) / (n + v). So that would match.

Wait, but wait. Is that correct? Because in the case where v is zero, the speed should be 1/n, which is correct because (1 +0)/(n +0) =1/n. Also, if n is 1, meaning the medium is vacuum, then the speed would be (1 +v)/(1 +v)=1, which makes sense because in vacuum, light speed is 1 regardless of the motion of the medium. Wait, but in reality, if the medium is moving, but it's a vacuum, the speed should still be 1. So that checks out.

Another test case: if v is very small compared to 1, what happens? Let's expand u as (1 + n v)/(n +v) = [1 + n v]/[n (1 +v/n)] ≈ [1 +n v ] /n [1 -v/n ] using the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈1 -x for small x.

So [1 +n v]/n * [1 -v/n ] = (1/n) [ (1 +n v) (1 - v/n) ) ] = (1/n) [1 +n v -v/n - (n v * v/n) ) ].

Wait, the terms:

1 *1 =1,

1*(-v/n) = -v/n,

n v *1 =n v,

n v * (-v/n) = -v².

So, (1 +n v - v/n -v²) multiplied by 1/n.

But for small v, v² is negligible.

So (1 + (n v - v/n )) *1/n = [1 + v(n - 1/n ) ] *1/n.

Wait, not sure if that's the best way, but the point is that for small v, the expression approaches (1/n) + v, as the first term is 1/n, and the next term would be v.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic limit, the velocity of light in the medium plus the velocity of the medium gives the observed speed. So in that case, the relativistic formula reduces to the Galilean addition.

But the problem doesn't specify whether v is small or not. So the correct approach is to use the relativistic formula, which gives option A.

Wait, but why isn't it option B? Because option B is 1, which would only be the case if the medium is moving at speed v such that the light's speed is 1. But that's only when (1 +n v)/(n +v) =1.

Solving (1 +n v) = (n +v) → 1 +n v =n +v → 1 -n = v (n -1). Hmm, for example, if n=2, then 1-2 = v (2-1) → -1 = v (1) → v=-1. But in the problem, v is the speed towards the observer, so it's positive. So that only happens if n=2 and v=-1, which is not general.

So option B is only correct in specific cases, not generally.

So the correct answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Speed of Light in the Medium**: The speed of light in a medium with refractive index \( n \) is given by \( v_{\text{light}} = \frac{1}{n} \).

2. **Motion of the Medium**: The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer. To find the speed of light relative to the observer, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' \cdot v}{c^2}}
   \]
   Here, \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) is the speed of light in the glass (medium's frame), and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab frame. Substituting \( c = 1 \), the formula becomes:
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{1}{n} \cdot v}{1}} = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]

3. **Simplification**: Simplify the denominator:
   \[
   1 + \frac{v}{n} = \frac{n + v}{n}
   \]
   Substituting back, we get:
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}} = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]

4. **Verification**: 
   - If \( v = 0 \), the speed reduces to \( \frac{1}{n} \), which is correct.
   - If \( n = 1 \) (vacuum), the speed becomes \( \frac{1 + v}{1 + v} = 1 \), consistent with the speed of light in a vacuum.
   - For small \( v \), the expression reduces to \( \frac{1}{n} + v \), matching the non-relativistic limit.

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \) matches the derived formula.
   - **Option B**: \( 1 \) is only valid in specific cases (e.g., vacuum) and not generally.
   - **Options C and D**: These do not match the derived formula and are incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
