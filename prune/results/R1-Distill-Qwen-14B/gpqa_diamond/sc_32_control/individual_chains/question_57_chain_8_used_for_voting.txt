Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of scattering theory. But let's try to think this through step by step.

The question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. They've given me some phase shifts: δ0 is 90 degrees, δ1 is 67 degrees, δ2 is 55, δ3 is 30, and δ4 is 13 degrees. Oh, and the electrons are 50 MeV, but I'm not sure if that's relevant for this particular calculation. Hmm.

Wait, in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) can be expressed using the partial waves. The general formula I remember is something like f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ [ (a_l + b_l cosθ) e^{i l φ} ], where a_l and b_l are related to the phase shifts δ_l. Oh right, and the partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude.

But the question specifically asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. That should be when θ is 0 degrees because that's when the particle scatters along the same direction as the incident beam. Wait no, actually, θ=0 is the same as the incident direction, so maybe that's where the forward scattering is. Oh wait, when θ is 0, cosθ is 1. So in the partial wave expansion, the terms with cosθ would be significant.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f is a complex quantity, and it's often written in terms of the real and imaginary parts. The imaginary part is particularly important because it relates to the cross-sections. Oh, I remember that the differential cross-section involves |f|^2, but the imaginary part contributes to the absorption or something like that.

Wait, the problem is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So I need to compute Im[f(θ, φ)] where (θ, φ) is along the incident beam direction. Wait, but the direction along the beam is probably θ=0, φ=0. So maybe I need to evaluate f at θ=0 and φ=0, then take the imaginary part.

So first, let's think about the general formula for the scattering amplitude. The formula is f(θ, φ) = sum over l of ( ( e^{2iδ_l} - 1 )/(2ik) ) * ( (2l + 1)/(2) )^(1/2) * ( (l - m)! )/( (l + m)! ) ) * e^{i m φ }, maybe? Or wait, perhaps a simpler approach is needed.

Wait, in the partial wave expansion, the amplitude f can be written as f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ ( ( e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ) * (2l + 1) ) * ( P_l^0 (cosθ) ) e^{i l φ} ), where P_l^0 is the Legendre polynomial. Wait, but for the case when φ=0, the exponential term becomes 1, so e^{i l * 0} =1. So the φ dependence is gone in that case.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The scattering amplitude is given by f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ ( ( e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ) * (2l + 1) ) * ( (l - m)!/(l + m)! )^{1/2} ) * e^{i m φ} * P_l^m (cosθ) )

Wait, but in this problem, we're considering the case along the beam direction, which I think is θ=0, φ=0. So for θ=0, cosθ=1, and P_l^m (1) is zero except for m=0, where P_l^0(1) =1. So for each term, when θ=0, only the m=0 terms survive. So f(0, 0) would be (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty ( (e^{2iδ_l} -1) * (2l +1) ) * (1) * e^{i l * 0} * P_l^0(1) )

But wait, P_l^0(1) is 1, so each term is (e^{2iδ_l} -1) * (2l +1) * (1/(2ik)).

So f(0,0) is (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^{∞} (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l +1) )

But the problem says to ignore rest of the phase shifts beyond δ4, so I guess that means l=4 and below. So in this case, l goes from 0 to 4, because the given phase shifts are δ0,δ1,...,δ4.

So now, the formula becomes f(0,0) = (1/(2ik)) [ sum_{l=0}^4 (e^{2i δ_l} - 1) * (2l +1) ]

But wait, the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So I need to compute Im[f(0,0)].

So first, let's compute each term in the sum. Let's compute each (e^{2i δ_l} - 1) factor.

Each term is (e^{i 2 δ_l} - 1). Let's write this as 2i e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l). Because e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, so e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ} = 2i sinθ. Wait, but in this case, (e^{i 2δ_l} -1) can be rewritten as e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - e^{-i δ_l}) ) / e^{-i δ_l} ? Hmm, maybe a different approach.

Wait, e^{iθ} -1 = e^{iθ/2} [e^{iθ/2} - e^{-iθ/2}] = e^{iθ/2} * 2i sin(θ/2). So, e^{iθ} -1 = 2i e^{iθ/2} sin(θ/2).

In our case, θ is 2 δ_l. So (e^{i 2 δ_l} -1 ) = 2i e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l). So each term in the sum is (2i e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l)) * (2l +1).

So substituting this into the sum, we have:

sum_{l=0}^4 [2i e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l) (2l+1) ]

Which can be factored as 2i sum_{l=0}^4 [ e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l) (2l+1) ]

So putting this into the expression for f(0,0):

f(0,0) = (1/(2ik)) * 2i sum [ ... ] 

The 2i and 1/(2ik) can simplify. Let's compute that.

(1/(2ik)) * 2i = (2i)/(2ik) = 1/k.

So f(0,0) = [ sum_{l=0}^4 ( e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l) (2l+1) ) ] / k

But since k is the wavevector, and the electron energy is given as 50 MeV. Wait, but wait, units... I need to calculate the imaginary part of this expression.

Wait, the expression is [ sum ( e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l (2l+1) ) ] / k

But e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l.

So each term in the sum is (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l) * sin δ_l * (2l+1)

Which expands to [cos δ_l sin δ_l (2l+1) + i sin^2 δ_l (2l+1) ]

So the entire sum is sum [ cos δ_l sin δ_l (2l+1) + i sin^2 δ_l (2l+1) ]

Which can be broken into real and imaginary parts:

Real part: sum cos δ_l sin δ_l (2l+1)

Imaginary part: sum sin^2 δ_l (2l+1)

So f(0,0) = [ Real part + i Imaginary part ] / k

So the imaginary part of f(0,0) is [ sum sin^2 δ_l (2l+1) ] / k

Because when you divide by k, which is a real number, it just scales the imaginary part.

So the problem reduces to calculating the sum S = sum_{l=0}^4 sin^2 δ_l (2l +1 )

Once we have S, then the imaginary part is S/k.

But wait, what is k? k is the wave number, which is related to the electron's momentum. The energy of the electron is given as 50 MeV.

So we need to find k. The relation between energy and wave number for an electron is given by the relativistic energy-momentum relation. Since 50 MeV is a significant fraction of the electron's rest mass (which is about 0.511 MeV), relativistic effects are important.

The rest mass energy of the electron is m c^2 ≈ 0.511 MeV. The kinetic energy here is 50 MeV, which is much larger than the rest energy, so the electron is ultra-relativistic. But let me think about the exact formula.

In general, the total energy E is given by E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2, where p is the momentum. So p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c.

But the wave number k is given by p/(ħ), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Or more accurately, k = p/(ħ c) * c, wait no, let me get that right.

Wait, the relation between momentum and wave number is p = ħ k, so k = p / ħ. But wait, sometimes people use units where c is in there, depending on the system of units. Oh, this can get a bit confusing.

Wait, in particle physics, they often use natural units where ħ = c = 1, but when working in SI units, we have to include them.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute k using the non-relativistic formula, but since 50 MeV is way higher than the rest mass, the non-relativistic approach won't be accurate. So we need to use the relativistic formula.

Let me think again.

The total energy E of the electron is the sum of its kinetic energy (50 MeV) and rest energy (0.511 MeV), so E ≈ 50.511 MeV.

But since 50 MeV is much larger than 0.511 MeV, E ≈ 50 MeV.

E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 )

Solving for p:

p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c^2 * c ?

Wait, let me get the units right. Let's work in units where c=1 for simplicity, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute everything in a consistent unit system.

Wait, let's compute k as follows.

The wave number k is given by k = (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^{1/2} / ħ c

Because E = ħ c k, but when E is much larger than m c^2, E ≈ ħ c k.

But let me write the formula correctly.

E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2

So p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c

Then, since k = p / ħ, so

k = [ sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c ] / ħ

= [ sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) ] / ( ħ c )

But let's compute this.

Given E = 50 MeV + 0.511 MeV ≈ 50.511 MeV.

But since 50 MeV is so much larger than 0.511 MeV, (E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) ≈ E^2, so E ≈ sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) ≈ pc, so p ≈ E / c.

But perhaps for precise calculation, I should include the (m c^2)^2 term.

Let me compute E=50.511 MeV,

m c^2 = 0.511 MeV.

So E^2 = (50.511)^2 (MeV)^2 = approx 2551.6 MeV^2.

m c^2 squared is (0.511)^2 ≈ 0.261 MeV^2.

So E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ≈ 2551.6 - 0.261 ≈ 2551.339 MeV^2.

So sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2) ≈ sqrt(2551.339) ≈ 50.511 MeV (since 50.511^2 is 2551.6, which is a bit higher, but close enough.)

So p = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c = (50.511 MeV) / c.

Then, k = p / ħ.

But we need to get the units right. Let me think about the units for ħ.

In natural units where ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm (since 1 fm = 1e-15 m), so ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So 1/(ħ c) ≈ 1/(197.33 MeV fm) → so 1/(ħ c) = 1/(197.33 MeV fm) ≈ (1 MeV^-1 fm^-1) * 1/197.33.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute k as:

k = (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^{1/2} / (ħ c)

But since E is in MeV, and m c^2 is in MeV, and ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm, we can compute k in units of fm^{-1}.

So, let's compute numerator:

sqrt( (50.511 MeV)^2 - (0.511 MeV)^2 ) ≈ 50.511 MeV (since 0.511 is negligible compared to 50.511).

So numerator ≈ 50.511 MeV.

Denominator: ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So k ≈ (50.511 MeV) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) = 50.511 / 197.33 fm^{-1} ≈ 0.2559 fm^{-1}.

Wait, wait a second. Let me compute that.

50.511 divided by 197.33 is approximately 0.2559.

So k ≈ 0.2559 fm^{-1}.

But wait, k is in units of 1/fm. So, the denominator is 197.33 MeV fm, and the numerator is 50.511 MeV. So 50.511 / 197.33 ≈ 0.2559, and the units are (MeV)/(MeV fm) )= 1/fm.

So k ≈ 0.2559 fm^{-1}.

Now, back to the problem. The imaginary part of f(0,0) is S / k, where S is the sum of sin^2 δ_l (2l +1) for l=0 to 4.

So let's calculate S.

Given the phase shifts:

δ0=90°, so sin δ0 = sin(90) = 1.

δ1=67°, sin(67) ≈ ?

Let me compute the sines:

sin(90) = 1.

sin(67) ≈ 0.9205.

sin(55) ≈ 0.8192.

sin(30) = 0.5.

sin(13) ≈ 0.22495.

Now, compute sin^2 for each:

sin^2(90) = 1.

sin^2(67) ≈ (0.9205)^2 ≈ 0.8473.

sin^2(55) ≈ (0.8192)^2 ≈ 0.6710.

sin^2(30) = 0.25.

sin^2(13) ≈ (0.22495)^2 ≈ 0.0506.

Now, multiply each by (2l +1):

For l=0: (2*0 +1) =1 → 1 *1 =1.

l=1: (2*1 +1)=3 → 3 *0.8473 ≈ 2.5419.

l=2: (2*2 +1)=5 →5 *0.6710 ≈3.355.

l=3: (2*3 +1)=7 →7 *0.25 = 1.75.

l=4: (2*4 +1)=9 →9 *0.0506 ≈0.4554.

Now, sum them all up:

1 + 2.5419 = 3.5419.

3.5419 +3.355 ≈6.8969.

6.8969 +1.75=8.6469.

8.6469 +0.4554≈9.1023.

So S≈9.1023.

Wait, let me double-check the multiplications:

l=0: 1 *1 =1.

l=1:3 *0.8473 ≈2.5419.

l=2:5 *0.6710≈3.355.

l=3:7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 *0.0506≈0.4554.

Yes, the sum is 1+2.5419=3.5419; +3.355=6.8969; +1.75=8.6469; +0.4554=9.1023.

So S≈9.1023.

Now, the imaginary part is S / k.

We have S ≈9.1023, and k≈0.2559 fm^{-1}.

So Im(f(0,0)) ≈9.1023 / 0.2559 ≈?

Let me compute that.

9.1023 / 0.2559 ≈ let's see.

0.2559 *35.5 ≈0.2559*35=8.9565, 0.2559*0.5≈0.12795 → total ≈9.0845.

Hmm, 35.5 → 9.0845.

But 9.1023 is a bit more. So 35.5 would give 9.0845, difference is 9.1023 -9.0845=0.0178.

0.0178 / 0.2559 ≈0.0693.

So total Im(f) ≈35.5 +0.0693≈35.5693 fm.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Wait, none of the options is around 35.5 fm. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm. Let me retrace the steps.

Wait a second. Did I compute k correctly? Let me double-check.

We said that E is about 50.511 MeV, and that k = (E^2 - (m c^2)^2 )^(1/2) / (ħ c).

Wait, but in the calculation, I approximated sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4) as E. But let's be precise.

E = 50.511 MeV.

m c^2 = 0.511 MeV.

So E^2 = (50.511)^2 ≈ (50)^2 + 2*50*0.511 + (0.511)^2 = 2500 + 51.1 + 0.261 ≈2551.361.

m c^2 squared is (0.511)^2 ≈0.261.

So E^2 - (m c^2)^2 = 2551.361 - 0.261 = 2551.1.

sqrt(2551.1) ≈50.508 MeV.

So p c =50.508 MeV.

So p =50.508 MeV / c.

Wait, but when using units where ħ c ≈197.33 MeV fm, then k = p/(ħ) → but p is in MeV/c, so:

k = (p c) / (ħ c^2) ) → Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of units.

Wait, ħ has units of J s, but perhaps it's better to use units where ħ c is in MeV fm.

We know that ħ c ≈197.33 MeV fm.

So,

k = (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^{1/2} / (ħ c) )

= [50.508 MeV] / (197.33 MeV fm )

= (50.508 / 197.33 ) fm^{-1}

≈0.2555 fm^{-1}.

Which is what I had earlier.

So k≈0.2555 fm^{-1}.

So S/k is approximately 9.1023 / 0.2555 ≈35.63 fm.

But the options are way larger than this. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for the scattering amplitude.

Wait, in the partial wave expansion, the scattering amplitude f is (1/(2ik)) times the sum.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is f = sum ... * e^{2iδ_l} -1 divided by (2ik) (2l+1) ... ?

Alternatively, maybe I forgot a factor of 2 in the exponent.

Wait, let me think again.

The partial wave expansion is:

f(θ,φ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) * (2l+1) ) * ( (l - m)!/(l +m)! )^{1/2} ) * e^{i m φ } * P_l^m (cosθ )

But when θ=0, P_l^m (1) is zero except for m=0, so only m=0 terms contribute.

So for each l, the term is (e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) * (2l+1) * (1/(2ik)).

So f(0,0) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l} (e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) (2l +1 )

As before.

But wait, perhaps I should not have included the (2l+1) factor in the sum. Let me check.

Wait, in the partial wave expansion, each term is (e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) multiplied by (2l+1), so the sum is over (e^{2iδ_l}-1) (2l+1).

So when I compute the imaginary part, which is Im[ sum (e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) (2l+1) / (2ik) ]

Wait, but in my earlier approach, I tried to compute (e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) as 2i e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l, which is correct.

So substituting that in, the sum becomes sum [ 2i e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l (2l+1) ]

Then, the entire f(0,0) is [ sum (2i e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l (2l+1) ) ] * (1/(2ik)).

Which is [ 2i/(2ik) ) sum ... ] → which simplifies to [ i/(k) ) sum ... ]

Wait, no. Let me re-express:

sum (e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) (2l+1) = sum [2i e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l (2l+1) ]

So f(0,0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ 2i e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l (2l+1) ]

Which simplifies to (1/(2ik)) * 2i (sum terms) → (i/(k)) sum terms.

Wait, so f(0,0) = [ i * sum (e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l (2l+1) ) ] / k.

So f(0,0) = i * [ sum (e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l (2l+1) ) ] / k.

So the imaginary part of f(0,0) is the real part of the numerator times i, divided by k. Wait, no, because the imaginary part is the coefficient of i.

Wait, f(0,0) = i * [ sum (e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l (2l+1) ) ] / k.

Which can be written as f(0,0) = i * [ sum ( cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ) sin δ_l (2l+1) ) ] / k.

Expanding the numerator:

sum [ cos δ_l sin δ_l (2l+1) + i sin^2 δ_l (2l+1) ) ]

So the numerator is a complex number: [ sum ( cos δ_l sin δ_l (2l+1) ) ] + i [ sum ( sin^2 δ_l (2l+1) ) ]

So f(0,0) = i * [ A + i B ] / k, where A is sum cos δ_l sin(2l+1) and B is sum sin^2 (2l+1).

So f(0,0) = i (A + i B) / k = [ i A - B ] / k.

So the imaginary part of f is (A)/k, and the real part is (-B)/k.

Wait, wait, no. Because [i (A +i B)] = i A - B.

So f(0,0) = (i A - B ) /k.

So f(0,0) is ( - B + i A ) / k.

So the imaginary part is A /k.

Because the imaginary part is the coefficient of i. So Im(f(0,0)) = A/k, where A is sum [ cos δ_l sin δ_l (2l+1) ]

Wait, this is different from what I thought earlier. Earlier, I thought the imaginary part was sum sin^2 δ_l (2l+1) /k, but now I see it's sum [ cos δ_l sin δ_l (2l+1) ] /k.

Wait, but earlier I thought the imaginary part was B/k, but now I see that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion.

Let me re-express this:

f(0,0) = (i * sum [ e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l (2l+1) ] ) / k.

Which is (i * sum [ (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ) sin δ_l (2l+1) ]) /k.

So expanding the numerator inside:

sum [ cos δ_l sin δ_l (2l+1) + i sin^2 δ_l (2l+1) ]

Which is [ sum ( cos δ_l sin δ_l (2l+1) ) ] + i [ sum ( sin^2 δ_l (2l+1) ) ]

Let me denote this as A + i B.

So f(0,0) = i (A + i B) /k = (i A - B ) /k.

Which is (-B + i A ) /k.

Thus, the real part is (-B)/k and the imaginary part is A/k.

So Im(f) = A/k.

Where A is sum_{l=0}^4 cos δ_l sin δ_l (2l+1 )

Earlier, I thought Im(f) was B/k, but that was incorrect. Now, it's A/k.

Oh, so I need to compute A instead of B.

So let's compute A.

A = sum_{l=0}^4 cos δ_l sin δ_l (2l+1 )

Compute each term:

l=0: cos(90) sin(90) *1 → cos(90)=0, so 0.

l=1: cos(67) sin(67) *3 → let's compute cos(67) ≈0.3907, sin(67)≈0.9205 → 0.3907 *0.9205 ≈0.3598 → multiplied by 3 →≈1.0794.

l=2: cos(55) sin(55) *5 → cos(55)≈0.5736, sin(55)≈0.8192 → 0.5736 *0.8192 ≈0.4707 → *5=2.3535.

l=3: cos(30) sin(30) *7 → cos(30)=√3/2≈0.8660, sin(30)=0.5 → 0.8660 *0.5=0.4330 → *7=3.031.

l=4: cos(13) sin(13) *9 → cos(13)≈0.9744, sin(13)≈0.22495 → 0.9744 *0.22495≈0.2192 → *9=1.9728.

Now, sum all the terms:

l=0: 0.

l=1:1.0794.

l=2:2.3535 → sum now 3.4329.

l=3:3.031 → sum 6.4639.

l=4:1.9728 → sum 8.4367.

So A≈8.4367.

Now, Im(f) = A /k.

k was approximately 0.2555 fm^{-1}.

So Im(f) ≈8.4367 / 0.2555 ≈33.03 fm.

But again, looking at the options, this is nowhere near any of them. So I must have made a mistake again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated k.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of k.

The formula for k is k = (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^{1/2} / ( ħ c )

E is 50.511 MeV.

m c^2 =0.511 MeV.

So E^2 = (50.511)^2 ≈2551.361.

m^2 c^4 = (0.511)^2 ≈0.261.

So E^2 - m^2 c^4 ≈2551.361 -0.261 =2551.1.

sqrt(2551.1 ) = approximately 50.508 MeV.

So p c =50.508 MeV.

So, p =50.508 MeV / c.

Now, ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm.

So, k = p / ħ = (50.508 MeV/(c)) / ( ħ )

Wait, because p = ħ k → k = p/( ħ )

But p is in MeV/c, and ħ is in MeV s, perhaps? No, I think in units where ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm, so ħ = (197.33 MeV fm ) / c.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too tangled. Let me think of it in terms of units.

We can express ħ c as 197.33 MeV fm. So, ħ = (197.33 MeV fm ) / c.

So, k = p / ħ = (p c ) / ( ħ c ) → since p is in MeV/c, p c has units of MeV.

So, (p c ) =50.508 MeV.

So, k = (50.508 MeV) / (197.33 MeV fm ) ) → (50.508 /197.33 ) fm^{-1}.

Which is approximately 0.2555 fm^{-1}, as before.

So I don't think that's the mistake.

Wait, perhaps in the calculation of the imaginary part, I should have considered the sum in a different way. Let me think again.

Wait, from the expression f(0,0) = (i (A +i B )) /k → which is (i A - B ) /k.

So the imaginary part is (A)/k, because (i A - B ) = imaginary part (A) times i, plus real part (-B).

Wait, perhaps that's correct, but given that, Im(f) = A/k ≈8.4367 /0.2555 ≈33.03 fm.

But none of the options match that. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial formula for f.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula for f is (1/(2ik)) times the sum, and when you take the imaginary part, you need to multiply by i.

Wait, f(0,0)= (sum (e^{2i δ_l} -1) (2l+1) ) / (2ik )

So, the imaginary part is Im[ sum (e^{2i δ_l} -1) (2l+1) ] / (2k )

Wait, because i is in the denominator.

Wait, let me compute the imaginary part correctly.

f(0,0) = [ sum (e^{2i δ_l} -1) (2l+1) ] / (2ik )

Let me write each term as (e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) = e^{i 2 δ_l} -1 = cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l) - 1.

So, the imaginary part of each term is sin(2δ_l) * (2l+1).

So, the imaginary part of the entire sum is sum_{l=0}^4 [ sin(2δ_l) (2l+1) ) ]

So, Im( sum )= sum sin(2δ_l) (2l+1 )

Thus, Im(f(0,0)) = [ sum sin(2δ_l) (2l+1) ) ] / ( 2k )

Wait, this might be the correct approach. Because f(0,0) is ( sum ... )/(2ik ), and the imaginary part is the imaginary part of sum divided by (2k) because 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k).

So, perhaps I should compute Im( sum (e^{2i δ_l} -1) (2l+1) ) which is sum [ sin(2δ_l) (2l+1) ]

So, let's compute that.

Each term is sin(2δ_l) multiplied by (2l+1).

Given:

δ0=90°, 2δ0=180°, sin(180)=0 → term is 0.

δ1=67°, 2δ1=134°, sin(134)=sin(46)=≈0.7193 → term=3 *0.7193≈2.1579.

Wait, wait. 134 degrees: 180-46=134, so sin(134)=sin(46)=0.7193.

δ2=55°, 2δ2=110°, sin(110)=sin(70)=≈0.9397 → term=5 *0.9397≈4.6985.

δ3=30°, 2δ3=60°, sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660 → term=7 *0.8660≈6.062.

δ4=13°, 2δ4=26°, sin(26)≈0.4384 → term=9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Now sum all these:

0 + 2.1579 =2.1579.

+4.6985 →6.8564.

+6.062→12.9184.

+3.9456→16.864.

So sum sin(2δ_l) (2l+1 ) ≈16.864.

Now, Im(f(0,0)) = sum / (2k )

k≈0.2555 fm^{-1}.

So 2k ≈0.511 fm^{-1}.

Im(f)=16.864 / (0.511 ) ≈33.03 fm.

Again, same as before. But the options don't have 33.03.

Hmm. So either I'm making a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps the approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the sum differently. Because in some references, the formula might have a different coefficient.

Wait, another approach: the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is given by (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ), perhaps.

Because in the partial wave expansion, the imaginary part can be written as Im[f] = (1/(2k)) sum_{l} (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) )

So, let's compute this.

sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ):

Which is exactly what I computed earlier, which was 16.864.

So Im(f) = (1/(2k)) *16.864.

k=0.2555 fm^{-1}.

So 2k=0.511 fm^{-1}.

So Im(f)=16.864 / (0.511 ) ≈33.03 fm.

Again, same result.

But the options are much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should have used E=50 MeV, ignoring the rest mass. Because 50 MeV is much larger than 0.511 MeV, the rest energy is negligible, so E≈50 MeV.

Let me recalculate k using E=50 MeV.

E=50 MeV.

m c^2=0.511 MeV.

So E^2=2500.

E^2 - m^2 c^4=2500 - 0.511^2≈2500 -0.261≈2499.739.

sqrt(2499.739)= approx 49.99739 MeV.

So pc=49.99739 MeV.

k=(49.99739 MeV )/(197.33 MeV fm )=49.99739 /197.33 ≈0.2535 fm^{-1}.

So Im(f) = 16.864/(2 *0.2535 )=16.864/(0.507) ≈33.25 fm.

Still around 33 fm, which doesn't match any options.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, let's recompute the sum sin(2δ_l) (2l+1):

l=1: δ=67 →2*67=134° → sin(134)= sin(46)= approx 0.7193.

So term:3*0.7193=2.1579.

l=2: δ=55 → 2*55=110° → sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9397 →5*0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:δ=30 →2*30=60 → sin(60)=0.8660 →7*0.866=6.062.

l=4:δ=13 →2*13=26 → sin(26)=0.4384 →9 *0.4384=3.9456.

Sum these:

2.1579 +4.6985 =6.8564.

+6.062 =12.9184.

+3.9456=16.864.

So that's correct. So sum is 16.864.

Wait, but perhaps the phase shifts are in radians instead of degrees? Oh no, that's a possibility.

Wait, the phase shifts given are in degrees. But if I mistakenly treated them as radians, the sine would be miscalculated.

For example, for δ=90 degrees, if treated as radians, it's π/2, so sin(2δ)=sin(π)=0. Which would change the sum.

But in the problem statement, phase shifts are given in degrees, so I think I did it right.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but the numbers are so large (like 90) that it's impossible. Because 90 radians is way too much, but the phase shifts in scattering are always periodic modulo 2π. So perhaps the phase shifts are in degrees.

Hmm.

Another possibility: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(2k).

But that would give a different result.

Wait, let's compute that.

sum (2l+1) sin δ_l:

l=0: (1) sin 90=1 →1.

l=1:3 sin67≈3*0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 sin55≈5*0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 sin30=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 sin13≈9*0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum:1 +2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.02455=13.382.

So sum=13.382.

Im(f)= sum/(2k ) →13.382/(2*0.2555)≈13.382/0.511≈26.19 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, the options given are much larger, so perhaps I made a mistake in units for k.

Wait, perhaps I should have used different units for ħ c.

Wait, ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm.

Wait, but sometimes in such calculations, the wave number k is expressed in units of inverse meters, not inverse femtometers. But that would make the result enormous, which doesn't fit the options either.

Wait, the options are in the order of 1e5 fm, which is 1e5 fm=1e5 *1e-15 m=1e-10 m, which is 0.1 nanometers. That's a large length scale.

Wait, but the scattering amplitude is usually of the order of a few femtometers, so an imaginary part of 33 fm seems large. But the options are even larger.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I should be using the rest mass energy correctly.

Wait, if E is 50 MeV, then E = 50 MeV, but m c^2 is about 0.511 MeV.

So,

E =50 MeV.

E^2 =2500 MeV^2.

m c^2=0.511 MeV.

So,

k = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / ( ħ c ) = sqrt(2500 - 0.261 ) / (197.33 MeV fm )

= sqrt(2499.739) ≈49.99739 MeV.

So,

k=49.99739 MeV / 197.33 MeV fm ≈0.2535 fm^{-1}.

So,

Im(f) = sum sin(2δ_l) (2l+1 ) / (2k ) →16.864 / (2*0.2535 )=16.864/0.507≈33.25 fm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the initial approach is incorrect, and perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is different.

Wait, another approach: the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is proportional to the sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ?

Wait, perhaps I should have used sum (2l+1) sin δ_l instead of sin(2δ_l).

Wait, let's compute that sum.

sum (2l+1) sin δ_l:

l=0:1 *1=1.

l=1:3 *0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 *0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum:1 +2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.02455=13.382.

So sum=13.382.

Then, Im(f)= sum/(2k )=13.382/(2*0.2555)=13.382/0.511≈26.19 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for Im(f) is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2k )

But that gives 26.19, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor is incorrect. Maybe the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by something else.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by (1/(2ik)) * sum (e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) (2l+1 )

So, Im(f) is the imaginary part of [ (sum (e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) (2l+1) ) / (2ik) ]

Which can be written as:

Im(f) = [ Im( sum (e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) (2l+1) ) ] / (2k )

Because 1/(2ik ) is a real factor in front, except for the i.

Wait, but wait, 1/(2ik )= -i/(2k ), so when you take the imaginary part, it's:

Im( [sum ] * (-i/(2k )) ) = Re( sum ) * (-i)/(2k ) → but that's not correct, I think.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part is computed as follows:

f = (sum ... )/(2ik )

sum ... is a complex number: sum (e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) (2l+1 )

Let me denote sum ... as C + i D, where C is real part and D is imaginary part.

Then f= (C + i D )/(2ik )

= [ C/(2ik ) ) + i D/(2ik ) ]

= [ C/(2ik ) ) ] + [ D/(2k) )

= [ -i C/(2k) ) ] + [ D/(2k) ]

So, the real part is D/(2k )

The imaginary part is (-C)/(2k )

Wait, so Im(f) = (-C)/(2k )

Where C is the real part of sum (e^{2i δ_l}-1 ) (2l+1 )

So, C = sum [ Re(e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) (2l+1) ]

= sum [ (cos(2δ_l) -1 ) (2l+1) ]

So, let's compute C.

C = sum_{l=0}^4 (cos(2δ_l ) -1 ) (2l+1 )

Compute each term:

l=0: (cos(180) -1 ) *1 → ( -1 -1 ) *1= -2.

l=1: cos(134)≈cos(134)=cos(180-46)= -cos(46)≈-0.6947 → ( -0.6947 -1 )= -1.6947 → multiplied by 3 →-5.0841.

l=2: cos(110)=cos(180-70)= -cos(70)=≈-0.3420 → (-0.3420 -1 )= -1.342 → *5 →-6.71.

l=3: cos(60)=0.5 → (0.5 -1 )= -0.5 → *7 →-3.5.

l=4: cos(26)=≈0.8988 → (0.8988 -1 )= -0.1012 → *9 →-0.9108.

Now, sum all these:

-2 + (-5.0841 )= -7.0841.

-7.0841 + (-6.71 )= -13.7941.

-13.7941 + (-3.5 )= -17.2941.

-17.2941 + (-0.9108 )= -18.2049.

So C ≈-18.2049.

Thus, Im(f)= (-C )/( 2k )= (18.2049 )/( 2 *0.2555 )=18.2049 / 0.511 ≈35.62 fm.

Again, same as earlier, around 35.6 fm.

But none of the options match. So I'm clearly missing something.

Wait, perhaps the initial formula is incorrect. Another source I recall says that the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is given by (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

Which would make Im(f)= sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )/(2k )

Which we calculated as 16.864/(2*0.2555)=33.25 fm.

But since the options don't have this, perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the wave number k should be in a different unit. Let me compute k again.

Another way to compute k is:

k = (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^{1/2} / ( ħ c )

E =50 MeV.

m c^2=0.511 MeV.

E^2=2500 (MeV)^2.

m^2 c^4=0.261 (MeV)^2.

E^2 - m^2 c^4=2499.739 (MeV)^2.

sqrt(2499.739 )=49.99739 MeV.

So,

k=49.99739 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm )=49.99739 /197.33 ≈0.2535 fm^{-1}.

So, 1/k ≈3.945 fm.

Wait, but in the earlier calculation, Im(f)=35.62 fm, which is 35.62 fm=35.62 *1e-15 m.

But the options are in the range of 1e5 fm, which is 1e-10 meters, so perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the differential cross-section, but no, the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f = (1/(2ik)) sum (e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) (2l+1 )

But perhaps the sum is multiplied by (l - m)!/(l + m)! )^{1/2} and so on, which I haven't considered.

But wait, in the case of θ=0 and φ=0, m=0, so (l -0)!/(l+0)! )^{1/2}=1.

So that term is 1. So earlier calculations should have been correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the imaginary part of the amplitude in the Born approximation, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the calculation of the phase shifts. The given phase shifts are δ0=90°, δ1=67°, etc. But perhaps they are in radians, which would change everything.

Wait, if the phase shifts were in radians, δ0=90°= π/2 ≈1.5708 radians.

But the given phase shifts are 90, 67, etc., which would be way too large in radians.

But, for example, if δ0=90 degrees → 1.5708 radians, but δ1=67 degrees → 1.169 radians.

But using radians, let's recalculate the sum Im(f)= sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )/(2k )

Compute each term:

l=0: sin(2*1.5708 )=sin(3.1416 )=0 → term=0.

l=1:2δ=2*1.169≈2.338 radians. sin(2.338)=approx 0.7255 → term=3*0.7255≈2.1765.

l=2:2δ=2* (55 degrees in radians)=55 * π/180≈0.9599 rad → 2δ=1.9198 rad → sin(1.9198)=0.944 → term=5 *0.944≈4.72.

l=3:2δ=60 degrees → π/3 rad → sin(2π/3 )=√3/2≈0.866 → term=7 *0.866≈6.062.

l=4:2δ=26 degrees → 0.4537 rad → sin(0.4537)=≈0.437 → term=9*0.437≈3.933.

Sum:2.1765 +4.72=6.8965; +6.062=12.9585; +3.933≈16.8915.

Im(f)=16.8915/(2k )

k=0.2535 fm^{-1}.

2k=0.507 fm^{-1}.

Im(f)=16.8915 /0.507≈33.30 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Hmm. Perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the given answer is option B) 355.351 fm.

But how does that happen? Maybe I missed a factor of 10 or 100 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, in my earlier calculation, I used ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

But sometimes, ħ c is approximated as 197.33 MeV fm, but perhaps I should use more precise value.

Wait, let's compute k more accurately.

E=50 MeV.

E^2=2500 MeV^2.

m c^2=0.511 MeV.

E^2 - (m c^2)^2 =2500 -0.261=2499.739 MeV^2.

sqrt(2499.739)=49.99739 MeV.

So,

k=49.99739 MeV / (197.327 MeV fm )

=49.99739 /197.327 ≈0.2535 fm^{-1}.

So, 1/k ≈3.945 fm.

Wait, perhaps the formula requires the imaginary part to be multiplied by 1/k, not divided.

Wait, in the expression Im(f)= A/k, where A is 8.4367.

But 8.4367 /0.2535 ≈33.29 fm.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is Im(f)= A / (k * something )

Wait, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Let me recheck the partial wave expansion.

The general form is:

f(θ,φ)= (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ ( e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) (2l+1) [ (l - m)!/(l + m)! ]^{1/2} e^{i m φ} P_l^m (cosθ )

At θ=0, φ=0, so m=0.

So,

f(0,0)= (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ ( e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) (2l+1 ) P_l^0(1 )

P_l^0(1)=1.

So,

f(0,0)= (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) (2l+1 )

Which is the same as before.

So,

Im(f(0,0)) is the imaginary part of [ (1/(2ik )) sum (e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) (2l+1) ]

Which is [ Im( sum (e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) (2l+1) ) ] / (2k )

Because the imaginary part of [ (1/(2ik )) * (a + ib) ] is [ b/(2k) ].

So,

Im(f)= [ Im( sum (e^{2i δ_l} -1 ) (2l+1) ) ] / (2k )

Which is [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] / (2k )

Which we found to be 16.864/(2*0.2535)=33.30 fm.

But the options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the phase shifts. The given phase shifts are for electrons, and perhaps they are in radians? No, because 90° is 1.57 radians, and sin(2δ_l) for 2δ=3.14 radians (l=0) is zero, which doesn't change the sum.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps the intended answer is option B) 355.351 fm.

But without a clear path, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that I should have taken the sum as (2l+1) sin δ_l, and then multiplied by something else.

Wait, considering that I've tried multiple approaches and can't get the answer to match any of the options, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option B) 355.351 fm.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by (something else) like 1000.

Wait, sum sin δ_l (2l+1 )=13.382.

If I multiply this by 27.3 (since 13.382 * 27≈361, which is close to option B's 355), perhaps that's the case.

But I don't know why I would multiply by 27.3.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= [ sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ] * (1/(2k )) * (1000 fm )

But that would make it 13.382 * 1000 fm / (2*0.2535 ) →13.382 *1000 /0.507≈26400 fm, which is way too big.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (1/k )

Which would be 13.382 /0.2535≈52.74 fm.

Still not matching.

In conclusion, I think I must have made a mistake in the approach, but I can't figure it out. Given the options, option B is 355.351 fm, which is 10 times larger than my calculated 33.30 fm.

So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 in the calculation of k. Let's see: if k were 0.02555 fm^{-1}, then Im(f)=16.864/(2*0.02555 )=16.864/0.0511≈330.3 fm, which is near option A (87k) and option B (355). But that would require a k of 0.02555, which is 10 times smaller than what I calculated.

But why would k be ten times smaller? Oh, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E.

Wait, E=50 MeV? No, 50 MeV is correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula for k is (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^{1/2} / ( ħ c ), but I should have used E in MeV, m c^2 in MeV, and ħ c in MeV fm.

But the calculation seems correct.

I'm stuck, so perhaps I should pick the closest option. Given that all my approaches give around 33 fm, but the options are much larger, perhaps the correct answer is option B) 355.351 fm.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for elastic electron scattering. The given phase shifts are δ₀ = 90°, δ₁ = 67°, δ₂ = 55°, δ₃ = 30°, and δ₄ = 13°. The energy of the electrons is 50 MeV, and the rest of the phase shifts are ignored. The goal is to compute Im[f(0,0)].

### Key Formula and Approach
The scattering amplitude is expressed using the partial wave expansion:
\[
f(θ, φ) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (e^{2iδ_l} - 1)(2l+1)P_l^m(\cosθ)e^{imφ}.
\]
For θ = 0 and φ = 0, only the m = 0 terms contribute, simplifying the expression to:
\[
f(0,0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (e^{2iδ_l} - 1)(2l+1).
\]
The imaginary part of \(f(0,0)\) is given by:
\[
\text{Im}[f(0,0)] = \frac{\text{Im}\left[\sum_{l=0}^\infty (e^{2iδ_l} - 1)(2l+1)\right]}{2k}.
\]
The imaginary part of the sum involves terms proportional to \(\sin(2δ_l)\), leading to:
\[
\text{Im}[f(0,0)] = \frac{\sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1)\sin(2δ_l)}{2k}.
\]

### Calculation of \(k\)
The wave number \(k\) is related to the electron's momentum and energy:
\[
k = \frac{\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{\hbar c}.
\]
Given \(E = 50 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(mc^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV}\), the energy difference is:
\[
E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = 2500 - 0.261 = 2499.739 \, \text{MeV}^2.
\]
\[
k = \frac{\sqrt{2499.739}}{\hbar c} = \frac{49.99739}{197.33} \, \text{fm}^{-1} \approx 0.2535 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

### Calculation of the Sum
The sum \(\sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1)\sin(2δ_l)\) is computed for \(l = 0\) to \(l = 4\):
- \(l = 0\): \(\sin(2δ_0) = \sin(180^\circ) = 0\), term = 0.
- \(l = 1\): \(\sin(2δ_1) = \sin(134^\circ) \approx 0.7193\), term = \(3 \times 0.7193 \approx 2.1579\).
- \(l = 2\): \(\sin(2δ_2) = \sin(110^\circ) \approx 0.9397\), term = \(5 \times 0.9397 \approx 4.6985\).
- \(l = 3\): \(\sin(2δ_3) = \sin(60^\circ) \approx 0.8660\), term = \(7 \times 0.8660 \approx 6.062\).
- \(l = 4\): \(\sin(2δ_4) = \sin(26^\circ) \approx 0.4384\), term = \(9 \times 0.4384 \approx 3.9456\).

Summing these terms:
\[
\sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1)\sin(2δ_l) \approx 0 + 2.1579 + 4.6985 + 6.062 + 3.9456 = 16.864.
\]

### Final Calculation
The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:
\[
\text{Im}[f(0,0)] = \frac{\sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1)\sin(2δ_l)}{2k} = \frac{16.864}{2 \times 0.2535} \approx 33.30 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Discrepancy with Options
The calculated value of \(33.30 \, \text{fm}\) does not match any of the provided options, which are significantly larger. A possible explanation is a missing factor in the calculation, such as a misinterpretation of units or an additional scaling factor. Given the options, the closest plausible answer is **B) 355.351 fm**, though the reasoning for this discrepancy remains unclear.
