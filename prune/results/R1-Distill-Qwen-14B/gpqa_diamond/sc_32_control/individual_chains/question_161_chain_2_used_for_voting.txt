Okay, so I have this question about transmission electron microscopes and mean free paths. Hmm, I remember that mean free path is related to how far a gas molecule travels before colliding with another molecule. Right, the mean free path (λ) is given by the formula λ = 1/(√2 n π d²), where n is the number density and d is the average diameter of the molecules. Or wait, another formula I think is λ = (k*T)/(√2 π d² n), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature. Oh wait, I think the mean free path also depends on pressure and temperature. Because lower pressure should mean lower density of gas molecules, thus longer mean free path.

In the scenario, Mike created an ultra-high vacuum with pumps, so the pressure is very low. That would make λ1 pretty large because at low pressure, the mean free path increases. But then when he turns on the electron beam, the mean free path becomes λ2, which is different from λ1. Why would that happen?

Wait, the electron beam—when it's active, it's producing a lot of electrons. Those electrons might interact with the gas molecules. Oh, right! The electrons can cause the gas molecules to ionize or maybe even pump more gas out of the system. Or perhaps the beam itself heats the gas molecules because of the energy transfer. Wait, no, the sample compartment temperature remained the same. So temperature is the same as before, so that can't be it.

Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam could cause the gas molecules to scatter more. But wait, the mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. If the beam scatters the electrons, maybe the gas molecules are acting as scattering agents for the electrons. But how does that affect the gas molecules' mean free path?

Wait, perhaps when the electron beam is on, it introduces additional factors. For instance, gas molecules in the presence of the beam might collide more frequently with each other due to some induced effects or because the beam causes more ionization, which would increase the number of collisions. Wait, but the pressure is already low, so the number density is low. Hmm.

Oh wait, when the electron beam is on, it might cause more gas molecules to be excited or even cause them to be removed from the system. Or maybe it causes the gas molecules to become charged, which could affect their scattering behavior. But I'm not sure how that would change the mean free path.

Wait, another thought: the mean free path in the initial state (λ1) is calculated based on the static conditions—ull vacuum, so factors like pressure and temperature. When the electron beam is on, perhaps the beam's energy (1000 kV is really high) could cause gas molecules to be more likely to scatter the electrons, but how does that affect the gas molecules' own movement?

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas molecules to become ionized, thus creating charged particles. Charged particles would interact more with the vacuum chamber walls, perhaps leading to more frequent collisions. But wait, the problem states that the temperature is the same, so maybe the mean free path of the gas would change because the effective cross-section for collisions might change.

Wait, the cross-section for collision depends on the velocity of the particles. Oh, but in thermal equilibrium, higher temperature would increase the velocity, but the temperature hasn't changed. Hmm.

Wait, another factor: the electrons in the beam have a much higher energy than the thermal motion of the gas molecules. So when the electrons hit the gas molecules, perhaps they cause the gas molecules to gain energy, maybe even ejecting them from the system. But Mike is seeing a change in the mean free path, so λ2 is different from λ1. But how?

Wait, wait. The mean free path of the gas molecules depends on their own collisions. If the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to move more, or perhaps to have more frequent collisions with each other, that would change λ. But why would the presence of the beam affect that?

Alternatively, maybe the beam causes some of the gas to be pumped away, reducing the effective pressure. If the pressure drops, then the number density n decreases, which would increase λ. But the scenario says that the beam is on, but the initial λ1 was determined under vacuum. Wait, but the mass spectrometer detected gas particles despite the ultra-high vacuum, which means that some gas remains.

Hmm, perhaps the electron beam increases the rate at which gas particles are removed from the system. But in the problem statement, Mike detected some gas particles, so maybe when the electron beam is on, the gas is somehow being further pumped out. But that's not directly stated. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is being ionized and then the ions are accelerated and hit the walls, leading to more gas being pumped away, thus lowering the pressure, which would increase the mean free path. So λ2 would be larger than λ1. But wait, the mean free path was λ1 when the system was at ultra-high vacuum without the beam. So if the beam causes the pressure to drop further, then λ2 would be greater than λ1.

But wait, the problem says that the mean free path when the beam is on is λ2. So if the pressure has dropped (because more gas is being pumped out due to the beam), then n decreases, so λ = 1/(n) times some constants, so λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Wait, but another possibility is that the beam's electrons are causing more collisions between the gas molecules, leading to more scattering. That would decrease the mean free path, making λ2 smaller than λ1.

But I'm not entirely sure which effect dominates. Let me think about the physical principles.

The mean free path λ for a gas is given by the formula:

λ = 1/(√2 n π d²)

where n is the number density, d is the molecular diameter.

If the pressure is lower, n is lower, so λ increases. But if the presence of the beam somehow increases the collision rate between gas molecules, that would imply that they collide more often, reducing λ.

But why would the beam cause more collisions between gas molecules?

Alternatively, perhaps the beam doesn't directly affect the gas molecules' collisions but affects whether the gas remains in the compartment. For example, when the beam is on, the high-energy electrons might cause gas molecules to become ionized, which then get attracted to the walls and are pumped out by the vacuum system, thus lowering the pressure. Lower pressure implies lower n, leading to a larger mean free path. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

But wait, the initial state (before beam) already had an ultra-high vacuum. Could the beam actually cause the pressure to decrease further? Or maybe the beam somehow increases the rate of gas removal, so n decreases, making λ longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the beam causes the gas molecules to be heated, but since the temperature is the same, that doesn't affect λ. Hmm.

Another angle: when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving at relativistic speeds, and their scattering with the gas molecules could cause those gas molecules to be more likely to scatter each other because of the energy transfer. Wait, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, the beam could cause the gas to become a plasma, but that's probably not in this scenario since the pressure is ultra-low.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the beam causes the gas to expand or something else, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, the problem says that after turning on the beam, the mean free path is no longer λ1 but λ2. So what changed?

Wait, the presence of the beam introduces a new factor: the scattering of electrons by the gas molecules. But how does that affect the gas molecules' own mean free path?

Hmm, perhaps when the beam is on, the gas molecules are more likely to be hit by the electrons, which could cause them to move more, but I'm not sure how that affects their own collision rates.

Wait, another approach: The mean free path is determined by the probability of collisions between gas molecules. The presence of the beam may not directly affect the gas molecules' own collisions but could change the effective pressure if the beam somehow pumps more gas out.

For example, the high-energy electrons might knock gas molecules into the walls, which could then be pumped away. This would reduce the pressure, so n decreases, leading to λ2 = (1/n2) * ... which is greater than λ1 because n2 < n1.

Wait, but in the initial state, the pressure is already very low, so n is very small. If the beam causes further reduction in n, then λ would increase. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

But wait, the problem says that Mike detected gas particles in the compartment. So even with the beam on, some gas remains. So if the beam is causing a change in the mean free path, perhaps λ2 is greater than λ1 because the pressure is lower.

But wait, the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules. If the pressure is lower, n is lower, so the mean free path is longer. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

Option C: λ2 < λ1

Option D: λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1

Option B says they're equal, which Mike thought was the case but found a discrepancy.

So if λ2 is greater than λ1, then the options would be A or D. But why would λ2 be greater? Because the mean free path is longer under the beam.

Wait, but another thought: when the beam is on, the electrons can cause the gas to become ionized. Ionized gas molecules (ions) have a different way of interacting with the vacuum chamber. They might stick more to the walls or be pumped more effectively.

In a vacuum system, neutral gas molecules can be pumped by the vacuum pumps, but if they are ionized, they can be captured more efficiently by the pumps, leading to a lower pressure. So the presence of the beam would cause more ionization, leading to a lower pressure (n decreases), so the mean free path λ increases.

So λ2 would be longer than λ1, so λ2 > λ1. So among the options, A says lambda2 >= 1.22 times lambda1. So if the pressure is lower, lambda increases. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

But wait, another angle: the mean free path is also affected by the collision cross-section. If the beam causes the gas molecules to have a larger effective cross-section, then λ would decrease. But I don't know why that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the beam increases the rate of molecular collisions. How? Maybe because the gas is being heated. But the temperature is the same, as stated. So that shouldn't be a factor.

Wait, perhaps the beam-induced ionization leads to more frequent collisions between ions and neutral gas molecules. So maybe collisions increase, thus λ decreases. But that's a bit of a stretch.

Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me try to remember what I know. The mean free path in a gas increases with lower pressure (since n decreases). So if the beam causes the pressure to drop, then λ increases.

So in this scenario, when Mike turned on the beam, the pressure might have decreased further, leading to a longer mean free path.

But why would the pressure decrease when the beam is on? Well, the electron beam could cause more gas molecules to be removed from the chamber. For instance, ionized gas molecules might be more quickly pumped out by the vacuum system. So n would decrease, so λ increases.

So in that case, λ2 would be larger than λ1. So the correct answer would be that λ2 >= 1.22*λ1, which is option A.

Wait, but why 1.22? Oh, that number is approximately the square root of 2 times the Bohr radius over something else? Or perhaps it's a factor from the mean free path formula when considering something else. Alternatively, maybe that's a distractor; perhaps it's a specific value from a textbook or a standard problem.

Wait, another thought: the mean free path can also be approximated by the formula λ = (k*T)/(√2 π d^2 n), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the molecular diameter, and n is number density. If n decreases (because pressure decreases), λ increases.

So, the presence of the electron beam would lead to a lower pressure, thus a higher λ.

So λ2 would be greater than λ1. So among the options, option A or D. Wait, the options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1

Hmm, but why is option D a choice? Because maybe the pressure doesn't drop enough to cause a 1.22 factor. Alternatively, perhaps the beam doesn't significantly change the pressure, so λ2 doesn't increase that much.

But in the problem statement, Mike accurately determined λ1, but upon turning on the beam, he found a different λ2. So perhaps the beam's presence doesn't significantly change the pressure, but the mean free path is affected because the collision mechanism changed.

Wait, perhaps the beam causes the gas molecules to lose energy, making their mean free path shorter. But why would that happen? If the beam scatters the gas molecules, causing them to lose energy and collide more often.

Wait, for example, in thermal equilibrium, the mean free path is determined by the thermal motion. If the beam gives energy to the gas molecules, perhaps their velocities change, affecting the collision rate. But if the temperature is the same, the thermal velocities wouldn't change. So maybe the gas molecules are not losing energy but perhaps their effective cross-section for collisions is increasing because of the beam.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam causes the gas molecules to have a higher rate of collisions with each other because the electrons are providing an external disturbance. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, considering that the electron beam is a source of radiation, perhaps it increases the rate of gas escaping the chamber, thereby reducing n and increasing λ. So λ2 is larger than λ1.

If that's the case, then λ2 would be greater than λ1, so options A or D.

Wait, but why would the mean free path not go up a lot? Maybe because the pressure isn't dropping by much. So the mean free path increases, but not by a factor of 1.22. So perhaps λ2 is just a bit larger than λ1, making D the correct option.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the beam causes an increase in the effective cross-section, which would decrease λ.

Wait, another thought: electron scattering might cause the gas molecules to have more frequent collisions. How?

If the gas molecules are being hit by electrons, which have a much higher energy, perhaps this leads to more frequent collisions between the gas molecules themselves. Because when a gas molecule is hit by an electron, it might move more, increasing the chance of colliding with another gas molecule.

But wait, in the scenario, the gas molecules were already under very low pressure. So their number density is low. So even if each collision with an electron makes them move more, but since n is already low, the overall effect on their collision rate might be minimal.

Alternatively, perhaps when the beam is on, the gas molecules have a higher velocity due to the energy transfer. But again, in thermal equilibrium, the temperature is fixed, so the velocities are the same as before.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the context of electron microscopy. In TEM, when the electron beam is on, it's a high-intensity beam, which can cause sample heating, gas molecule ionization, or even gas molecule ejection.

In ultra-high vacuum, the presence of the electron beam can contribute to better pumping because ionized molecules are more easily captured by the vacuum system. So the pressure would decrease, leading to a longer mean free path.

So in this case, λ2 would be longer than λ1, so λ2 > λ1.

Looking at the options, only options A and D suggest λ2 > λ1.

But the options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1

So the question is, would λ2 be significantly larger than λ1 or just slightly larger?

Well, the initial state was already ultra-high vacuum, so any further reduction in pressure would only increase the mean free path by a small factor. So perhaps λ2 is just a little larger than λ1, making option D the correct choice.

Alternatively, the mean free path in an electron microscope could be in the range of micrometers to millimeters. The presence of the beam might not drastically change the pressure, so the increase in λ might not be as large as 1.22 times.

Wait, but the question says that the mean free path after the beam is turned on is λ2, and the observation is that it's different from λ1. So the question is, why does this happen?

If the pressure is lower, then λ increases. But another possibility: the gas molecules are being ionized, and thus their mean free path is different because they're charged. Charged particles have a different collision behavior. For instance, charged particles can experience electric fields and might have a shorter mean free path because they can be accelerated towards the walls more quickly.

Wait, ionized gas particles would have a shorter mean free path because they can be attracted to the walls and pumped out more effectively. So if the beam causes ionization, then more gas molecules are removed, leading to lower pressure. Wait, that would increase the mean free path because n decreases.

But wait, if the gas is ionized, the ions have a longer mean free path because they're less likely to collide with each other, but more likely to be captured by the walls. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Another approach: mean free path is inversely proportional to the product of number density and collision cross-section.

So, λ = 1/(n * σ * sqrt(2))

If the beam causes the collision cross-section σ to increase, then λ decreases. For example, if the beam causes the gas molecules to have a larger effective diameter (maybe due to polarization or something), then σ increases, leading to a shorter mean free path.

Alternatively, if the beam causes the molecules to be ionized, perhaps the cross-section changes.

But I'm not certain about that.

Wait, another factor: if the beam is on, it's possible that gas molecules are being knocked out of the system, so their number density n decreases, making λ increase. But the question says that some gas remains, so n is still non-zero.

So, in the presence of the beam, n is lower, so λ increases. So λ2 > λ1.

Thus, the correct answer would be option A or D. But why would the mean free path be at least 1.22 times as much? That number could come from something like the ratio of the pressure before and after. For example, if the pressure is 1/2 of the initial, then λ would double. But 1.22 is approximately sqrt(1.5), which isn't a standard factor I'm familiar with.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path after the beam is on is actually smaller. Because when the beam is on, the electron scattering could increase the rate of collisions between gas molecules, which would make λ smaller.

Wait, but why would the rate of collisions increase if the pressure is lower? Because lower pressure usually implies lower collision rates. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the beam leads to more frequent collisions between gas molecules. How? Maybe the electrons cause the gas to become more turbulent, increasing the collision rate. But in a vacuum, I'm not sure how that works.

Alternatively, maybe the beam's electric field causes the gas molecules to move in such a way that they collide more often. But I don't know enough about that.

I think I'm stuck between two possibilities: either λ2 is larger than λ1 (A or D) or smaller than λ1 (C). But given that the beam could cause the pressure to drop, making λ longer, I think the answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so either A or D.

But since the question gives options, I'll have to choose between them.

Another thought: perhaps the presence of the beam changes the effective temperature of the gas. But the problem states that the sample compartment temperature remains the same. So that's not it.

Wait, could the presence of the beam cause the gas to become a plasma, leading to more frequent interactions? Maybe, but that's probably not the case in an ultra-high vacuum.

Alternatively, perhaps the vacuum pumps are more effective at removing gas when the beam is on, which would lower the pressure, thus increasing λ.

But considering all this, I think the presence of the beam reduces the pressure, leading to a longer mean free path. So λ2 is larger than λ1.

Looking at the options, option A is λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 and option D has λ2 between λ1 and 1.22*λ1.

But the problem states that the initial determination was accurate, so when the beam is on, the mean free path changes. I think that if the pressure drops, the mean free path increases. So λ2 is larger than λ1. So the correct answer would be either A or D.

But why would the factor be 1.22? Maybe that's a specific factor from the scenario. Alternatively, perhaps the scenario is implying that the mean free path becomes shorter. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the beam causes the gas molecules to have a higher rate of collisions because the electrons are providing an energy source. Maybe the gas is more excited, leading to more frequent collisions. So if the collision rate increases, the mean free path would decrease.

So in that case, λ2 < λ1, which is option C.

But why would the collision rate increase? If the beam is causing the gas molecules to move faster, but the temperature is the same, so their thermal speed isn't changing. Unless the beam is adding energy to the system, increasing the temperature, but the problem says the temperature remains the same.

Hmm, perhaps the beam is causing the gas to ionize, and the ions are moving faster. But that would increase their speed, leading to more collisions. But again, the temperature is the same, so maybe the ions are moving faster due to their charge, but their kinetic energy is the same as the neutral molecules.

Wait, maybe the effective cross-section for collisions increases when the gas is ionized. So if the gas becomes ionized, the collision cross-section σ increases, because charged particles may attract each other more, leading to more frequent collisions. So λ = 1/(n σ sqrt(2)), so if σ increases, λ decreases.

So this would result in λ2 < λ1, which is option C.

But I'm not certain about this. It depends on whether ionization increases or decreases the collision cross-section.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam causes the gas to be removed, leading to a lower pressure and longer mean free path.

Since I'm a bit stuck, I'll try to think about what the options imply.

If the mean free path is longer, the options are A or D. If it's shorter, option C.

In the initial state, the mean free path is λ1, which is already long because the pressure is ultra-low. If the beam causes even lower pressure, λ2 would be longer. But perhaps the beam's effect isn't that significant, so λ2 is only slightly longer. So option D would be the case.

But the problem states that Mike accurately determined λ1, but the beam caused a change. So perhaps the change is significant.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam leads to a higher rate of gas removal, thus n decreases, leading to λ2 being much larger than λ1, so option A.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the mean free path depends on the square root of the pressure. Because λ is proportional to 1/sqrt(P), since P = n k T. So if pressure decreases by a factor, the mean free path increases by the inverse square root.

Wait, if pressure halves, λ doubles.

So if the presence of the beam causes the pressure to decrease by a factor of, say, (1/1.5), then λ increases by sqrt(1.5) ≈ 1.22. So λ2 would be approximately 1.22*λ1, so option A would be the case.

But in the problem, Mike found that the mean free path changed. So perhaps the pressure dropped by a factor that made λ2=1.22 λ1, which would make option A correct.

Alternatively, maybe the pressure didn't drop enough, so λ2 is just a bit larger than λ1, making option D the correct choice.

I think the most plausible conclusion is that the presence of the electron beam causes the gas pressure to drop, leading to a longer mean free path. So λ2 is greater than λ1. Among the options, A and D are candidates. But without knowing the exact factor, it's hard to choose between them. However, the question provides option A as ">= 1.22*λ1" and D as "between λ1 and 1.22*λ1".

If the pressure drops, but not by a full factor that would make λ2 1.22 times, then D would be the answer. If the pressure drops enough, then A would be correct.

But the question doesn't give specifics on how much the pressure changes. So perhaps the correct answer is that λ2 is longer than λ1. But the options don't have a general 'λ2 > λ1' option except A and D.

Wait, looking back, the question says that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1. So the beam caused a change.

If the beam causes the pressure to drop, λ increases. So the possible options are A or D.

But I'm not seeing a clear reason why the mean free path would be exactly 1.22 times.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam doesn't change the pressure but changes the effective cross-section, leading to a shorter mean free path.

Wait, another thought: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are more likely to collide with the electrons rather than with each other. So the mean free path of the gas molecules is determined by their own collisions, but if the beam is causing more electron-gas interactions, perhaps the gas molecules' mean free path isn't affected as much. Or maybe the beam scatters the gas molecules more, leading to more frequent collisions with each other. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam reduces the mean free path because the electrons cause the gas molecules to lose energy, making their movements more restricted and collisions more frequent. But I'm not certain.

I think I've thought this through as much as I can. Based on the reasoning that the beam causes the pressure to drop, leading to a higher mean free path, I would lean towards λ2 > λ1.

So looking back at the options, the correct answer would be either A or D. Since the problem doesn't specify the exact factor, but the options are A) λ2 >=1.22 λ1 and C) λ2 < λ1.

Wait, another way to approach this: the mean free path is often calculated using the formula λ = (k*T)/(√2 π d² n).

If the electron beam introduces a factor that makes the effective n (number density) lower, then λ increases. Since the beam is on, perhaps the effective n is lower due to gas being pumped out. So λ2 increases.

So the correct answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so options A or D.

But the question doesn't give me more information, so perhaps the only way is to consider that the beam's presence increases the mean free path, making A or D correct.

Wait, the options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1

The problem says that Mike found that the mean free path was different from λ1. So the options are A, C, or D.

But if the presence of the beam reduces the pressure, which causes λ to increase. So the correct answer would be either A or D.

If the pressure drops by a significant amount (say, a factor of 1.5), then λ increases by sqrt(1.5) ≈ 1.22, so λ2 = 1.22 λ1. Thus, option A would be correct.

But if the pressure drops less, λ2 would be between λ1 and 1.22 λ1, making option D correct.

But given that the question says the compartment is already at ultra-high vacuum, perhaps the pressure doesn't drop significantly when the beam is turned on. So maybe the factor is smaller than 1.22, making option D correct.

Alternatively, the problem could be that the presence of the beam causes the gas to have a higher effective cross-section, thus reducing the mean free path (option C). But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the beam doesn't change the pressure but changes the effective mean free path. For example, the beam causes the gas to be ionized, leading to more efficient scattering, so the mean free path is shorter.

If that's the case, then λ2 < λ1, option C.

But I don't have enough information to decide. I think the most plausible conclusion is that the mean free path increases because the pressure drops. So λ2>λ1, meaning the answer is either A or D.

Another thought: Mike observed the mean free path change because the presence of the beam allowed gas to be pumped out more efficiently, thus reducing n, making λ longer. So this would support option A.

But without exact data, it's hard to say. However, given the options, I'll go with option C: λ2 < λ1. Because perhaps the beam increases the collision rate between gas molecules due to some mechanism I'm not considering, leading to a shorter mean free path.

Wait, no, that doesn't make much sense. I think the correct conclusion is that the presence of the beam leads to a longer mean free path, so the answer is either A or D.

But the problem states that Mike found λ2 different from λ1. So perhaps the answer is option C, where the mean free path decreases.

Wait, I'm going in circles. Maybe I should think about the scenario again.

The mean free path in the initial state is λ1. Upon turning on the beam, the mean free path changes to λ2.

If the electron beam causes the gas molecules to lose energy, they would move more slowly, leading to fewer collisions. But if temperature is the same, their speed remains the same, so that's not it.

Another possibility: The presence of the beam could cause the gas to become a plasma, which has different properties. In a plasma, the mean free path could be shorter because the charged particles interact more strongly.

Alternatively, the beam could cause gas to escape, reducing n, increasing λ.

Alternatively, perhaps the beam doesn't change the pressure much but causes the gas to be in a different state, leading to a different effective cross-section.

Given all this confusion, perhaps the correct answer is option C: λ2 < λ1.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, since the presence of the beam may not allow the gas to have a longer mean free path, perhaps the answer is C.

After all this, I think the correct answer is C: λ2 < λ1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in an ultra-high vacuum system under two conditions: when the electron beam is off (resulting in λ1) and when the electron beam is on (resulting in λ2). The analysis revolves around how the electron beam affects the gas molecules and the resulting changes in the mean free path.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mean Free Path Formula**: The mean free path is given by:
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 n}
   \]
   where \(d\) is the molecular diameter, and \(n\) is the number density of the gas. A lower \(n\) (due to lower pressure) increases \(\lambda\), while a higher \(n\) decreases \(\lambda\).

2. **Initial State (λ1)**: Before the electron beam is turned on, the system is at ultra-high vacuum, with a very low pressure. This results in a long mean free path, λ1.

3. **Effect of the Electron Beam**:
   - The electron beam introduces several potential effects:
     - **Pressure Reduction**: The beam may cause gas molecules to be ionized or removed from the system, reducing the number density \(n\). A lower \(n\) would increase the mean free path, making \(\lambda_2 > \lambda_1\).
     - **Collision Dynamics**: The beam could alter the collision rate between gas molecules. For example, ionization might increase the effective collision cross-section, leading to a shorter mean free path (\(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\)).
     - **Temperature**: The problem states that the temperature remains constant, so thermal velocity does not change.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A (\(\lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1\))**: This suggests a significant increase in the mean free path. This could occur if the electron beam drastically reduces the pressure, leading to a substantial decrease in \(n\).
   - **Option B (\(\lambda_2 = \lambda_1\))**: This implies no change in the mean free path, which contradicts the problem statement that Mike observed a discrepancy.
   - **Option C (\(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\))**: This suggests a shorter mean free path, possibly due to increased collision rates or changes in the effective cross-section.
   - **Option D (\(\lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < 1.22 \lambda_1\))**: This indicates a small increase in the mean free path, suggesting a modest reduction in pressure.

5. **Final Consideration**:
   - The problem does not provide explicit data on the extent of pressure reduction or changes in collision dynamics. However, the presence of the electron beam likely causes gas molecules to be ionized or removed, reducing \(n\) and increasing \(\lambda\). This supports the conclusion that \(\lambda_2 > \lambda_1\).
   - Among the options, **Option C** (\(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\)) is less plausible because the beam's primary effect is likely to reduce \(n\), not increase collision rates. Therefore, the most reasonable conclusion is that \(\lambda_2 > \lambda_1\).

### Conclusion:
The presence of the electron beam likely reduces the number density of gas molecules, leading to a longer mean free path. However, the exact factor of increase (e.g., 1.22 times) is not explicitly supported, and the problem does not provide sufficient data to definitively choose between options A and D. Given the reasoning, the most plausible answer is that \(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\), as the beam may alter collision dynamics in a way that reduces the mean free path.

Answer: C
